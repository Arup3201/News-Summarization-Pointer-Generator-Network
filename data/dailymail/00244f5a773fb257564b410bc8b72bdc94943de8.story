George Osbourne and other Minister splashed out £10,000 on lessons from the acting school

Chancellor George Osborne and other Coalition Ministers splashed out £10,000 of taxpayers’ money on acting lessons from Britain’s premier drama school at the same time as overseeing deep public-spending cuts.

They paid the world-famous Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) for actors and voice experts in a bid to boost their performance.

Rada, which helped launched the careers of Sir John Gielgud and Sir Kenneth Branagh, offers ‘role-playing’ with actors, voice-coaching and tips to boost ‘confidence and gravitas’.

Embarrassingly for Mr Osborne, details of the Treasury’s own £3,000 drama bill emerged just days after he warned of the need for fresh cuts.

Treasury officials refused to give details on what the lessons involved. 

Mr Osborne famously took voice-coaching from a £100-an-hour Harley Street expert to improve his own image when the Tories were in Opposition.

The Mail on Sunday revealed in 2008 that Mr Osborne had received help from leading speech therapist Valerie Savage to make him sound less ‘posh’.

According to Government credit card records, the Treasury last year paid for two sets of Rada courses –  £1,541 in October and £1,500 in February. 

The Department of Health spent just over £3,500 for three courses in 2012 while the Cabinet Office ran up a £675 bill in December, 2012.

The Department for International Development spent £2,370 on coaching in 2012/13.

Rada Enterprises, which provides the courses, lists eight other ministries and public bodies as ‘clients’.

Neither the Government departments nor Rada would yesterday say exactly what had been taught in the lessons.

But Whitehall officials insisted the coaching was for civil servants – not for Ministers.

Last night, a government spokesman said: ‘Civil servants need the right skills to perform at the highest level and deliver better, more efficient services for the public.’

A spokeswoman for Rada Enterprises insisted it provided ‘communication skills training’ – not acting lessons.

She added: ‘Communication is a core skill for in any professional environment and our training increases effectiveness in meetings, panels and presentations.’

But Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘When Ministers are rightly looking for extensive savings so that resources can be focused on delivering essential frontline services, people will be astounded that they are still splashing out on this kind of coaching.’
