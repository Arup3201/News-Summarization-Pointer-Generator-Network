A Lebanese porn star has received death threats after being ranked as the best actress in the business by a popular adult website.

Mia Khalifa, 21, grew up in Lebanon but moved to the U.S. as a teenager to enroll in college, before becoming involved in the adult film industry.

She is now the most searched for actress on movie-sharing website PornHub, an accolade which has drawn strong criticism from her country of birth.

Mia Khalifa, 21, who was born in Lebanon before moving to the U.S. as a teenager, has been attacked online after being voted porn's top actress by one of the world's top video-sharing sites

Twitter users branded Miss Khalifa 'disgusting' and 'vile', while one even threatened to 'cut her neck' after she was named as the internet's most searched-for adult star

Users have branded her 'ugly' and 'disgusting', while one vowed to 'cut her neck' and another posted a mocked-up photo of her being held hostage by ISIS murderer Jihadi John.

One particular source of outrage is a video which shows Miss Khalifa performing sex acts while wearing a hijab, part of the Muslim religious dress.

One user calling herself Fifi wrote: 'Mia Khalifa is neat and all but wearing hijabs in her porn vids is really problematic and gross.'

Another poster going under the handle of Ayeerab wrote: 'B**** wonders why Arabs bash on her. Maybe because you f****** degraded Muslims in a porno.'

Users reacted angrily to the news that Miss Khalifa had taken the top spot, calling her a 'disgrace'

Miss Khalifa began posting some of the abuse on her own Twitter profile, while responding to her critics, accusing many of being secret fans

Miss Khalifa was also heavily criticised for having an Arabic tattoo on her arm which reads 'Koullouna lil-watan, lil’oula lil-‘alam' - the first line of the Lebanese national anthem.

Another controversial tattoo is the Lebanese armed forces cross, which she has on her wrist. 

Miss Khalifa responded to the abuse by posting it on her Twitter profile, along with responses to users, hitting back at their comments and accusing some of being secret fans.

She added: 'Doesn’t the Middle East have more important things to worry about besides me? How about finding a president? Or containing ISIS?'

Lebanon has been badly affected by the civil war taking place in neighbouring Syria, including ISIS, which has threatened to spill over its borders.

Miss Khalifa hit back at her abusers, saying: 'Doesn’t the Middle East have more important things to worry about besides me? How about finding a president? Or containing ISIS?'

She also posted this image of a Chrismtas present she was given, saying it had cheered her up 'after a long day of death threats'

It has also been without a president since Michel Suleiman vacated his post in May last year after a six-year term, and politicians have so far been unable to find a suitable replacement. 

Miss Khlifa grew up in Lebanon, but moved to Maryland as a teenager before enrolling at the University of Texas at El Paso as a history major.

According to her Twitter profile she now lives in Miami, and describes herself as: 'Unofficial mascot of the Florida State Seminoles and a pornstar in the off-season.'

However she is believed to still have family living in Lebanon, where she was born in Beirut.
