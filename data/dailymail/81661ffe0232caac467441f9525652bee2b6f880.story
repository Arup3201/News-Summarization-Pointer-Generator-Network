Vapshot boasts it can turn any alcohol into a vapour, which is then inhaled with a straw.

The Vapshot machine is capable of injecting a fine mist of spirits into the serving container under pressure.

When served, the patron twists open the cap whereby it will 'pop' similar to uncorking a bottle of champagne and then a portion of the spirits will instantly vaporize, which can be consumed through a straw.

The remaining drink still in liquid form can be enjoyed as if it was served in a traditional manner.

Users can create a vapor only shot, a shot of liquor with a vapor shot, or even a full mix drink with a vapor shot.

However, health experts have warned the machine , and 'inhaled' alcohols in general, are far riskier than traditional drinks.

Bypassing the digestive system, the technique causes alcohol to be ingested directly to the bloodstream through the lungs, potentially causing dangerous levels of intoxication - especially if abused.

'It is ill advised for experimentation among those under 21,' said Dr. Thomas Greenfield, Center Director at the National Alcohol Research Center in Emeryville, California.

'There could be inexperienced people at parties under peer pressure who may find themselves using this method of alcohol consumption.

'It might not be possible to self-regulate their consumption and teenagers just like adults can be drunk drivers too.'

The makers of the new gadget proclaim: 'What if there was a brand new way to enjoy your favorite alcoholic beverages that’ll get the party started faster and won’t slow you down? Something new, trendy and sciency…yeah, we just made up that word.'

They also play on the notoriety that inhaled alcohol has attracted.

'You’ve probably heard about it all over the news and now you can enjoy vaporized alcohol anytime at home or at one of your awesome parties.

'Vapshot mini is designed to vaporize alcohol, which you can inhale with a straw. It hits you instantly and kick starts your buzz!'

However, the firm does address the safety concerns on its site, saying 'Because Vapshot is served in a regulated per serving size, it is possible to quantify the levels of intoxication and levels of acceptable ethyl alcohol in the lungs, which are both significantly lower than consumption of a traditional liquid shot or mixed drink.'

It does, however, also admit the effects can be felt more quickly.

'Vapshot introduces the alcohol directly into the blood stream through the lungs, which is very efficient.

'Normally when you take a drink, it has to go into your mouth, down your throat, into your stomach, then intestines and finally into your bloodstream to your lungs and brain.

'That takes a long time and a whole lot more alcohol to have the same effect.'
