Manchester United can overtake Chelsea and Manchester City to win the Premier League title this season, according to former defender Phil Neville.

Louis van Gaal's side have won their last six matches and currently sit in third place, eight points behind early pace-setters Chelsea.

And, in contrast to his brother Gary, who wrote off United's chances last week, Phil Neville believes they have a chance.

When asked on BBC Radio Five Live whether United could win a 21st league championships, he said: 'Yes, they can.

'At the moment, they've got the momentum and you just never know.'

Gary had ruled out United's chances after their match with Southampton last Monday, saying they didn't have enough quality in defence to sustain a title bid.

But their 2-1 win at St Mary's and Sunday's 3-0 home win over Liverpool have maintained their good form.

United's festive fixture list includes matches against the likes of Aston Villa, Newcastle, Tottenham and Stoke, which should yield plenty of points.

Phil Neville believes United will benefit from not playing European fixtures this season, giving them more time to recover between league matches.

He said: 'There are similarities between United this year and Liverpool last year, where Liverpool had no Champions League football.

'They've got no midweek games in Europe and, if teams slip-up, you just never know.'
