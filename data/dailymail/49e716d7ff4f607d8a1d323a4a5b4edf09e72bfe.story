LA Lakers' Kobe Bryant welcomed Steven Gerrard to Los Angeles by telling the Liverpool captain to 'kick some ass' and win the MLS title next year.

Gerrard's free transfer to LA Galaxy at the end of the current Barclays Premier League season was confirmed on Wednesday.

The 34-year-old has agreed an 18-month contract - worth £3.9million a year - and Bryant admits he has admired Gerrard 'for a very, very long time'.

'What can I say, man? Welcome to Los Angeles. Welcome to La La Land, and hopefully that means bringing another championship to the Galaxy. I'm sure it will.

'I'm looking forward to getting out there and watching you do your thing. 

'I've been a fan of yours for a very, very long time, and your versatility, and your aggressiveness, and your leadership.

'Welcome to Los Angeles, man. Enjoy. Kick some ass in the process. I'll be down there rooting you on my man. Peace.'

And Gerrard is relishing doing just that, too.

He told newspaper LA Times: 'I think it's a match made in heaven really. One of the reasons I chose LA Galaxy was because of the success they've had recently.

'I want to finish my career very strong. I want to add some medals and trophies to my collection.'
