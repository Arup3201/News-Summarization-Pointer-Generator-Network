For more than a month, Iceland's Bardarbunga volcano has been steadily spewing lava into the air, covering the region in a blanket of ash.

And while most people are being advised to stay away, a film director and photographer have not only travelled as close to the heart of the eruption as they could, they've managed to capture its volcanic activity in stunning high-definition.

Using a drone, fitted with a GoPro action camera, the pair were able to record footage in the centre of the area’s Holuhraun lava field, and provide an incredible view of its violent and blistering core.

The footage (pictured) was shot in the Bardarbunga volcanic system, Iceland using a quadcopter and a drone. It was captured by Eric Cheng, director of aerial imaging for drone-maker DJI, alongside photographer Ragnar Th. Sigurdsson on 20 September

Bardarbunga is a large central volcano lying underneath Iceland's Vatnajokull glacier, in the centre of the country.

It contains a 2,296ft-deep (700 metre) caldera, hidden beneath ice, covered in extensive flank fissures, from where the majority eruptions take place. 

The most recent eruption began in August, and experts believe it could last for up to a year. 

The Veidivötn fissure extends for over 62 miles (100km) to the south west, almost reaching Torfajökull volcano.

While the Trollagigar fissure extends 31 (50km) to the north east, towards the Askja volcano.

It was in this latter region that the footage was filmed.

Eric Cheng, director of aerial imaging for drone-maker DJI, alongside photographer Ragnar Th. Sigurdsson travelled to the region on 20 September, reports Wired.

They drove as close as they could, before having to complete the rest of the journey on foot, armed with gas masks and hiking boots.

Once the pair established a safe place to stand, they flew the DJI Phantom 2 quadcopter (pictured left) fitted with a GoPro Hero3 camera (pictured right) over the fissure. Mr Cheng piloted the drone using a wireless video transmission system to plot the route and capture the footage

Once the pair established a spot that was close enough to reach using the drone, but safe enough to stand, they flew the DJI Phantom 2 quadcopter fitted with a GoPro Hero3 camera over the fissure.

Mr Cheng piloted the drone using a wireless video transmission system to plot the route and capture the footage.

The morning after the footage was taken, the area was flooded with lava. It took the researcher three attempts to fly the drone (pictured) close enough to the eruption. The first two attempts failed because the film crew was stood too far away, and the drone kept returning because they were trying to fly it out of range

The $1,199 (£750) drone is fitted with sensors that are designed to return it to its launch position if it flies out of range of the pilot. It has a Wi-Fi communication distance of up to 3,280ft (1,000 metres), and flies for 25 minutes on a single charge

When the drone returned to Mr Cheng, the front of the GoPro had melted but the memory card inside had been protected.

The GoPro camera didn’t survive the trip – but its memory card did and the footage was recorded wirelessly
