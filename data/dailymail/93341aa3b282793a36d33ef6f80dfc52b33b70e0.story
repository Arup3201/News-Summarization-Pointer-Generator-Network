The man commanding Australia's joint task force in the Middle East says the Islamic State (IS) is vulnerable in Northern Iraq and will be destroyed.

In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Major General Craig Orme said IS has been successful in waging a 'psychological campaign' with shock and terror tactics, but that their military capability is weak.

'They are not magic,' he said, adding that like any army, IS fighters in Iraq need to refuel, rearm, secure their communication lines and supply their troops with essentials like food and shelter.  IS forces do not have the resources or organisational capability of a conventional army, he said.

'As they have tried to start acting like a state force, they play onto our ground and our expertise and they will get smacked,' said Major General Orme. 

'When they do mass we will smack them and smack them hard.'

'If they're sitting in one spot, we'll go and bomb them and we're happy to do that.'

Major General Orme said IS forces would not be able to rely on intimidation to obtain food and shelter from local people for very long and that the areas of Northern Iraq 'are a long way from their source of strength in Syria.'

He told the Daily Telegraph he has 'every confidence' that the US-led coalition will defeat IS over time and said coalition air operations were already having an impact on IS.  

'We are in the first quarter, things are looking positive and the wind is with us,' he told AAP reporters. 

Major General Orme's statements come days after Australian military forces made their first strike against Islamic State militants in Iraq. The Australian Department of Defence confirmed on Thursday that two bombs were dropped from an F/A-18F Super Hornet on to an ISIL facility. 

The next step will be deployment of Australian special forces to assist Iraqi security forces on the ground, with a legal agreement to proceed in the process of being finalised.

'There is a real sense that Australia is making a significant contribution, that that contribution is highly valued, that that contribution is making a difference,' said Major General Orme.

The United States has been bombing IS and other terrorist groups in Syria for two weeks with the help of Arab allies. Australia began flying combat operations in Iraq last Sunday.   

Australia's efforts 'are in response to a request for assistance by the Iraqi Government in combating ISIL terrorists, said a Department of Defence statement. 

No bombs were dropped in the first Australian mission which saw two F/A-18F Super Hornets leave a military base in Dubai to take out Islamic State targets.The jets flew around northern Iraq for seven hours but it was reported they did not locate targets and no munitions were used.

Authorities have warned a 'long campaign' lies ahead for forces in Iraq, with the recently deployed Air Task Group of F/A 18 jets thought to be the largest since the Vietnam War.They joined aircraft and tanker transportation already operating in the Middle East.

Defence Minister David Johnston said previously the government was 'optimistic' that they could quell the threat of Islamic State quickly. But he added: 'We must say months and more because we want to under-promise and over-deliver here.

'I'm quietly confident... but the fact is, we haven't even begun to deal with the threat to the civilian population in Iraq.'

Mr Johnston also said there was a chance Australian troops could be the focus of insider attack, which were seen during the Afghanistan War.

Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop claimed the Australian public supports a military campaign against Islamic State. 

Ms Bishop labelled the 'murderous terrorist organisation' as a threat not only to the Middle East but to Australia and the rest of the world, during the the United Nations Security Council in early September.

'The international community cannot with any conscience turn away,' she said.

Ms Bishop said sending Australian armed forces overseas 'is one of the most significant and serious decisions that any government can make,'

'We have considered it from every angle, and considered every option, and we know that Australia’s national security is at risk,' she told The Sunday Times. 

'I believe the Australian people understand the threat, and support the Australian Government doing all it can to keep them safe.'  

The aircraft were equipped with a 20mm cannon, GPS-guided munitions, laser-guided munitions, sidewinder heat-seeking missiles and radar-guided missiles

A Galaxy poll revealed that 62% of Australian voters are in favour of the Federal Government's decision to begin air strikes in Iraq against Islamic State

A Galaxy poll revealed that 62% of Australian voters are in favour of the Federal Government's decision to carry out air strikes in Iraq against Islamic State. A further three-quarters of voters also believed the threat of a terrorism attack on Australian soil was real.

Ms Bishop reinforced the findings of the poll as she addressed security concerns on Saturday.

Security and intelligence agencies were 'concerned that a terrorist attack could take place' within Australia, Ms Bishop said.

'They are not saying that one is imminent but they are saying Australia is a target,' she said.

'ISIS and similar organisations are opposed to open, tolerant and free societies. 

'Australia represents what they oppose and they try to eliminate any opposition to their crazy and murderous ideology.'

Ms Bishop encouraged Australians to continue their lives and to be 'pragmatic'.
