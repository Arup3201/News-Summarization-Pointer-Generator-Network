They are the innocent victims of the bloody Syrian civil war, young boys and girls left horrifically injured after government forces shelled their homes in brutal attack.

The youngsters, who suffered appalling shrapnel wounds, are pictured being treated at a makeshift hospital in the town of Houla near the flashpoint city of Homs yesterday.

Since the troubles began in March last year, Some 13,000 people, including 1,183 children, are said to have been killed.

Last week as the Red Cross declared 
the conflict a civil war, the government denied using heavy weapons in 
an attack on a village that left scores dead.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said the attack on Tremseh 
last Thursday was not a massacre - as activists and many foreign leaders
 have claimed - but a military operation targeting armed fighters.

'What happened wasn’t an attack on civilians. What has been said about 
the use of heavy weapons is baseless,” Makdissi told reporters in 
Damascus.

He said 37 gunmen and two civilians were killed - a far lower death toll
 than the one put forward by anti-regime activists, some of whom 
estimate that up to 200 people were killed.

But the United Nations has already implicated Assad’s forces in the 
assault. The head of the U.N. observer mission said Friday that monitors
 stationed near Tremseh saw the army using heavy weaponry and attack 
helicopters.

Although there has been a string of horrific attacks in Syria over the 
course of the uprising, the violence appears to be escalating.

Observers believe more than 150 
people were killed, which if confirmed would make it one of the 
bloodiest episodes of Syria’s 16-month uprising.

Fifteen
 more people were killed elsewhere in the country today, activists said.
 Among them was a family of four, including a girl whose body was pulled
 from rubble covered in blood and dust after their house was shelled in 
the central town of Rastan.

The
 claims and counter-claims arose as UN-Arab League Kofi Annan prepared 
to travel to Moscow for talks with President Vladimir Putin on the 
crisis.

Russia
 has been an ally of Syrian leader President Bashar al-Assad and his 
government, but has come under increased international pressure to 
support regime change.

Panic: UN monitors confirmed that they had found pools of blood and a burned school in the village

Speaking at a news conference 
in the capital Damascus, foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said 
Syrian government forces did not use helicopters and tanks in the 
assault on Treimsa, which happened on Thursday.

Today, President Bashar Assad's 
brother-in-law was among several senior officials killed in a suicide 
bomb attack in Damascus, it has been reported.

General
 Assef Shawkat was the deputy defense minister in Syria. He was among 
the most feared figures in Assad's inner circle and was married to 
Assad's elder sister, Bushra.

Defense
 Minister Dawoud Rajha and former Defence Minister Hassan Turkmani were 
also killed in the blast at the National Security building in 
Damascus.The interior minister Mohammed Ibrahim al-Shaar  was wounded.

Damascus-based activist Omar al-Dimashki said Republican Guard troops surrounded the nearby al-Shami Hospital where some officials were taken for treatment.

The blast came on the same day the U.N. 
Security Council was scheduled to vote on a new resolution aimed at 
pressuring the Syrian regime to comply with a peace plan.

Two brigadier-generals were among some 600 Syrians who fled from Syria to Turkey overnight, a Turkish official said on Wednesday.

It brings the number of Syrian generals sheltering in Turkey to 20, including a retired general.

The official could not immediately confirm if other defected officers had also arrived in Turkey in the last 24 hours but said a number of lower-ranking soldiers usually accompanied defecting generals.

The number of Syrian refugees in Turkey rose to 43,200 after 600 more arrived overnight, he said. 

But Russia remained at loggerheads with the U.S. and its European allies over any mention of sanctions and Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, which could eventually allow the use of force to end the conflict in Syria.

Besides a government crackdown, rebel fighters are launching increasingly deadly attacks on regime targets, and several massive suicide attacks this year suggest al-Qaida or other extremists are joining the fray.

Activists say more than 17,000 people have been killed since the uprising began in March 2011. The state-run news agency SANA reported that Wednesday's blast was aimed at the National Security building, a headquarters for one of Syria's intelligence branches and less than 500 meters (yards) from the U.S. Embassy.

Police had cordoned off the area, and journalists were banned from approaching the site.

Earlier Wednesday, SANA said soldiers were chasing rebels in the Midan neighborhood, causing 'great losses among them.' The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said army helicopters attacked the neighborhoods of Qaboun and Barzeh.

Stumbling block: Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with United Nations envoy Kofi Annan yesterday. Russia and China continue to the Assad regime by opposing UN sanctions

The key stumbling block is the Western demand for a resolution threatening non-military sanctions and tied to Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, which could eventually allow the use of force to end the conflict in Syria.

Russia is adamantly opposed to any mention of sanctions or Chapter 7. After Security Council consultations late Tuesday on a revised draft resolution pushed by Moscow, Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Alexander Pankin said these remain 'red lines.'

Russia has said it will veto any Chapter 7 resolution, but council diplomats said there is still a possibility of last-minute negotiations.

While facts on the ground often cannot be verified because independent media are largely excluded from Syria, the conflict is now seen by observers to have changed from an uprising in poor towns and villages to a civil war that has reached the streets of the capital.

It has also become a proxy war between Russia and Shi'ite Muslim Iran, which back Assad, one one side, and Sunni Muslim powerhouse Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar, which are arming and funding the Sunni rebels on the other.

The rebels now include the Free Syrian Army, a group of army defectors joined by Sunni youths, al-Qaeda style Jihadists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and local pro-democracy Sunni liberals.

Weapons are being smuggled across the borders from Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Jordan.

'Syria ... is clearly right now a battleground for proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, reflecting a centuries-old conflict between Shi'ite and Sunni powers,' said Ayham Kamel of Political Risk consultancy Eurasia.

While the rebels inside Syria are gaining ground, the Syrian political opposition in exile remains bogged down in factional divisions and is losing influence.

The government is meanwhile losing its ability to spread fear. Defections of senior officers and officials have accelerated in recent weeks although the backbone of the military remains intact due to Alawite solidarity.

'The Syrian regime is slowly and totally sinking. I don't know what the timeline will be. It is becoming difficult for the state to control the country. It is like a fire engine, they extinguish one fire and find that another fire has started in another place, said a senior Western diplomat.

'The army is overstretched, the government is under sanctions and there is erosion of power,' he added.
