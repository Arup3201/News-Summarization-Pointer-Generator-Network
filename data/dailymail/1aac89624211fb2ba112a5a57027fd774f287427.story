In a bid to get children away from the games console and exercising more, a team of designers has created a Fitbit-style device designed especially for young people.

The iBitz Kid pedometer syncs wirelessly with an iPhone or iPad and turns the steps taken by the child into a video game.

This game can then reward children with coins and content on Disney’s Club Penguin, or children can choose a gift from Amazon and a parent can set how many steps they must take to earn that gift.

The iBitz pedometer, pictured, from Geopalz was created in Colorado. When children step outside wearing the pedometer, the steps power a rocket ship in an iPhone and iPad game. It also syncs with a reward app where children can earn coins and content on Disney's Club Penguin

The iBitz for kids, also known as the PowerKey, is 1.5-inch tall, 1-inch wide, and can be attached to a child's hip or shoe.

It syncs wirelessly to the iBlitz app on an iOS device via Bluetooth.

Every step that the child takes powers a virtual rocket ship as it explores a fantasy galaxy.

The iBitz for kids, also known as the PowerKey, was created by Colorado-based firm Geopalz, run by trio Rich and Sheri Schmelzer, and Alexandra O'Leary.

Each PowerKey is 1.5-inch tall and 1-inch wide and can be attached to a child's hip or shoe.

They store 30 days of activity, are water-resistant and come in a range of seven colours – red, blue, pink, black, green, orange, and purple.

Each PowerKey has also been approved by the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act in the U.S, and none of the child's activity data can be shared outside of the family.

'With the creation of the ibitz, we've found a way to create a product that motivates both parent and child in a way that works for them,' said Geopalz CEO Rich Schmelzer.

'Parents are able to monitor goal progress and create accountability groups with family and friends, while children receive access to games and apps as a reward for excellent physical activity.'

Geopalz has also created the ibitz Unity for adults that tracks steps, distance, height, overall physical activity and BMI.

It can be linked with other iBitz in the family or with friends and track progress as a group.

The iBitz PowerKey costs $35, while the iBitz Unity costs $50, and both connect to iOS devices using the free iBitz app.
