The mother of a college sophomore who died last year from a rare case of bacterial meningitis honored her daughter's memory over the weekend by taking a group of young students to Canada to get the vaccine for the deadly disease.

Currently, the vaccine is not approved for use in the United States - had it been, Emily Stillman might still be alive.

Stillman, 19 at the time, was a sophomore at Kalamazoo College in Michigan when she called her mother to tell her she had a headache.

Action: Alicia Stillman started the Emily Stillman Foundation to spread awareness of the disease in honor of her daughter

Less than 36 hours later, Stillman was dead, killed by the first case of bacterial meningitis at Kalamazoo College in at least 15 years.

'I told her, "It's okay. You can go,'" Alicia Stillman, Emily's mother, tells PEOPLE magazine. 'I'll be strong. I promise you, I will be your voice. This
 will not happen to other people.'

Recently, there have been outbreaks of the highly contagious disease at Princeton University and University of California at Santa Barbara - and there still is no vaccine approved for use in the United States.

Outbreak: Last year, there was an outbreak of the rare disease on a number of college campuses across the U.S.

So, Alicia Stillman took a bus filled with students across the U.S./Canadian border to Windsor, Ontario, to get immunized.

Stillman has a son who is getting ready to attend the University of Michigan in the fall. According to NBC News, Stillman's sone and many of his classmates will be on the bus.

'I feel like I'm giving them such a gift,' Stillman told the network. 'I tell them, "I'm so honored to be able to help you 
protect your family in a way that I could not protect my daughter.'"

Vaccine: Alicia Stillman took her other children, seen here with Emily, to Canada along with dozens of other students to get immunized

The students were each given doses of Novartis' Bexsero, which has been approved in Europe, Australia and 
Canada. The drug also was given to thousands of college students throughout the U.S. during the meningitis outbreak last fall.

The drug is not yet approved for use in the U.S. but health officials say they are working on gaining approval for a bacterial meningitis vaccine.

'I couldn't help my own daughter and so now I'm going to help everybody else's,' Alicia Stillman tells PEOPLE. 'It's going to be emotional.'
