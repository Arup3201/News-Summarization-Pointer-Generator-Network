A huge 'garden sale' of the contents of a stately home has netted an aristocrat family over £3million.

William and Jennifer Copeland are moving out of Trelissick House in Cornwall and decided to hold an everything-must-go sale on the estate of all the relics they can't take with them.

More than 2,000 people visited the 18th century property in Cornwall to look at the ancient treasures that were collected from around the world by Mr Copeland's ancestors.

Sell off: Estimated prices for a few of the items being auctioned off from the Trelissick House stately home near Truro in Cornwall. All of the items have now sold

Most of the relics had no reserve price on them which meant that every single item sold.

One
of the highlights of the sale was an 18th century Chinese Quinlong-era 
vase which sold for £337,250 while two Chinese Kangxi pieces made 
£181,250.

A George II 
partners desk in the manner of Thomas Chippendale fetched £58,850, and a
Regency walnut, elm and rosewood ebony and ivory commode sold for 
£43,250.

At the lower end of the scale, a letter opener sold for £87, three pie dishes were bought for £125 and a suger bowl made £162.

One of the surprise lots were a set of Victorian silver-gilt sandwich name tags used for high tea that sold for £5,000 pounds.

In total the 835 lots made £3,269,238 when they went under the hammer.

The contents of Trelissick House in Cornwall raised around £3m at the ultimate garden sale

The Cunliffe-Copeland family had filled magnificent Trelissick House with treasures they acquired from travels around the globe.

The
18th century manor and gardens were left to the National Trust 58 years
ago on condition members of the family could carry on living in the 
property.

But the Copelands have now bought a normal-sized family home and are leaving Trelissick.

English
country house sales used to be a common occurrence in the 1950s and 
'60s but are very rare today, which is why it was so well attended.

Sell-off: A fine Spode dessert service set which had an estimated pre-sale value of £3,500 was sold for £6,500

Antique: A Canadian canoe from 1925 which has been used by the Copeland family sold for £5,000. It was estimated to reach just £1,200

Big collection: The Wine cellar which was among £3million worth of items which went under the hammer in the aristocratic garden sale

This picture was painted by famous equine artist John Frederic Herring, a former groom to the Copeland family, reached £11,250

Big price: This Chinese Qianlong-era vase, sold for £337,250, left,  while the pair of model lions went for £23,750

Roger Tappin, of auctioneers Bonhams which handled the sale, said: 'The result exceeded all our expectations.

'We had interest from three continents and that drove prices ever upwards.

'The sale was broadcast live round the world and bidding was fierce.

'It
was the widely accepted that the sale represented a once in a lifetime 
opportunity to acquire ceramic masterworks from China, the Middle East 
and Europe.

'The on-site auction gave everyone who has visited and loved Trelissick a chance to bid on a piece of Cornish history.

'We ended up selling 100 per cent of the items in the sale, many of them for many times more than their top estimates.'

Ancestral home: Treslissick House has been lived in by the same family for a century and has 25 rooms

Stunning views: The house and grounds, which are owned by the National Trust, overlook the Fal estuary

The Cunliffe-Copeland family have lived at Trelissick since 1913

Leonard Daneham Cunliffe was deputy governor of the Bank of England, co-founder of the merchant bank Cunliffe Brothers and director of the Hudson Bay Company.

When he died in 1937, he bequeathed much of his antiques collection to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

But he left his country house estate - Trelissick, in Cornwall - to his stepdaughter, Ida Copeland.

Ida was the daughter of Count Camillo Fenzi, a Tuscan senator, but her father died and her mother married Leonard Cunliffe and she moved to Cornwall.

Ida married Ronald Copeland, the president of Copeland and Spode, a successful ceramics company in Stoke-on-Trent.

In 1931, she stood successfully against Sir Oswald Mosley and became Conservative MP for Stoke.

In 1955, much of the estate was donated to the National Trust in 1955 by Mrs Copeland, William Copeland's grandmother.

This year, the last generation of the family will move out when William and Jennifer Copeland take their family to live in a smaller house nearby.
