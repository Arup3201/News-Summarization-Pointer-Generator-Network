Cheese made from sheep's milk is being falsely sold as goat's cheese in British supermarkets, according to an investigation.

Consumer watchdog Which? tested 76 samples of goats' cheese and found that nine contained cheese from sheep milk.

It said it became suspicious about the large amount of goats' cheese on sale, despite a European shortage of goats' milk and became worried goats' cheese manufacturers could be substituting goats' milk for other milks.

Which? joined forces with Professor Chris Elliott, a food safety expert at Queen's University, Belfast, and author of the government's independent review into the food supply network, to investigate the content of goats' cheese.

They bought 76 samples of goat's cheese from supermarkets, delis and markets from eight locations around the UK and tested them to see what they really were.

In total, nine samples were adulterated: three contained more than 80 per cent sheep's cheese, another three contained more than 50 per cent sheep's cheese and the final three around five per cent sheep's cheese.

Researchers would not reveal the retailers which shops were selling fake goats cheese.

Which? said: 'Sadly these results are not an isolated incident and reinforce the need for better checks so that people get what they pay for and can trust the food they buy.

Prof Elliott said: 'We tested the cheese samples for a wide range of different animal species. I had actually expected to detect some adulteration with cow's protein but what we found was substantial amounts of sheep protein in six cases.

'When I looked into why sheep products had been used, the answer seemed to be that there is plenty of this around and the taste to most of us will be very similar and thus 'undetectable' by the consumer.

'In four of the six cases the goat's cheese product was heavily contaminated with sheep protein originating from outside the UK. My message is not that all things foreign are bad, but that when supply chains are long and lack local knowledge and long term relationships there must be more opportunities for cheating and thus more checks are needed.

This is not the first time Which? has uncovered food fraud this year.

In May they tested lamb kebab takeaways and found that 24 out of 60 contained other meats, either chicken or beef or a mixture of both. And six of these contained no lamb at all. Both chicken and beef are cheaper than lamb, so a substitution cuts costs for manufacturers and caterers.

Last year horsemeat was discovered being substituted for beef in a number of processed foods, including, including supermarket ready meals. 

A Food Standards Agency spokeswoman said: 'Consumers have a right to expect that food is what it says on the label.

'We take any suggestion of food fraud seriously, and we will investigate with the relevant local authority any business supplying mislabelled products when we receive the details from Which?.'
