A former middle school teacher surrendered to authorities Tuesday to face a three-year jail sentence after having sex with a student and offering a plea deal to avoid a sex offender label.

Kristen Nicole Sullivan, 27, from Broward, Florida, will serve three years in prison followed by five years probation after the 13-year-old boy's girlfriend discovered the year-long relationship from a cell phone Sullivan purchased him for his 14th birthday.

During her probation she will not be allowed to teach children though she narrowly escaped being permanently labeled a sex offender with her decision to serve jail time instead.

'This way, she doesn't have to register as a sex offender, which would follow you the rest of your life,' Sullivan's attorney Bradford Cohen told the Sun Sentinel.

Mr Cohen admitted Sullivan 'should have known better,' explaining it as 'a serious lapse in judgement.'

Sullivan, charged with two counts of sexual battery on a victim between 12 and 17 years of age by a person with custodial authority, originally faced up to 30 years for these two counts alone.

She was also charged, however, with two counts of lewd and lascivious battery on a victim between 12 and 16 years of age that could have been punishable by up to an additional 15 years in prison.

She was arrested in April 2010 after 
the victim's girlfriend, both students at Lauderhill Middle School, 
reported the affair to the police.

The teen was in Sullivan's computer class.

Near the end of the school year, he 
told investigators that Sullivan had his C grade in science changed to a B.

Then,
one day in May 2009, he called her and asked for sex, according to the 
Miami Herald.

She told him they would 'talk about it'.

He claims they then had sex in the computer room the next morning, but she denies this.

When
his girlfriend found messages which read: 'Iâ€™m tired of being the one 
chasing you' and 'Why are you ignoring me?' he confessed that he had a 
relationship with her.

Police monitored a telephone call between the student and Sullivan on 
April 19, 2010, confirming the sexual nature of the relationship, 
according to the report.

The reason she was given such a light
sentence is because the prosecutors acknowledged that it was the 
student and not she who was the pursuer.
