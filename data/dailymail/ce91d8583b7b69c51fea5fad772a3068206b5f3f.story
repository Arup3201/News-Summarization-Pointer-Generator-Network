If you spotted this chap wandering in John Lewis, you might think he was lost. Or just passing through on his way to the barber’s.

But you’d be mistaken. This rather unkempt young fellow is the new face of the John Lewis men’s clothing range.

Not that you can see much of his face – thanks to the bushy beard and unbelievably messy mane of tumbling hair.

The brooding backpacker look: John Lewis's new model sports a bushy beard and tumbling, long hair

How this type of John Lewis man fits 
with the store’s reputation for middle-class respectability and  
tradition is yet to be explained.

But eyebrows are sure to be raised when customers spot him on the store’s website.

According to Matthew McCormack, John Lewis’s buying director, this new look ‘represents what the brand is about’.

He added: 'He is a little deconstructed but kind of smart and has a great sense of style.

'He is a bit dishevelled and is deliberately growing his hair, but he cares about his look.

'He is a hard-working, everyday-hero kind of bloke.'

The hairy model in question is Johnny Harrington, 32, a former carpenter from Milton Keynes.

The company specifically asked for a model with a beard for the new menswear range

The store specifically asked for a model with a beard to show off its John Lewis & Co men’s label.

Mr Harrington, who looks as if he’s just stepped out of a backpacker’s hostel and is said to have been growing his beard for three years, apparently fit the bill perfectly.

More traditionally clean-cut models are to be kept to promote the store’s other clothing lines.

A spokesman said: 'These particular images are different to what we have usually, but they haven’t alienated our customers and have attracted new ones.'
