Will Hayden, former star of the reality TV show Sons of Guns, has pleaded not guilty to the second of two rape charges filed against him in Louisiana

Will Hayden, former star of the reality TV show Sons of Guns, has pleaded not guilty to the second of two rape charges filed against him in Louisiana.

The 49-year-old is accused of sexually abusing an 11-year-old girl, and attacking another victim 20 years ago in Livingston Parish.

Hayden entered the plea Thursday, according to The Times-Picayune.  

Last week, Hayden, founder of Red Jacket Firearms, pleaded not guilty to one count of aggravated rape in Baton Rouge. 

In that incident, he's accused of raping a young girl multiple times between March 2013 and August 2014.

Frank Holthaus, Hayden's lawyer, told reporters last week the allegations against his client were untrue and that Hayden is ready to fight the claims made against him. 

Sons of Guns began airing in 2011 and followed Hayden's family-owned custom firearms business. 

Episodes often showed Hayden and his adult daughter, Stephanie, helping customers find weapons, including rifles. Other scenes showed the process of making the guns, images from firing ranges, and ammunition tips. 

Hayden was arrested on August 27 last year. 

After the arrest, The Discovery Channel canceled the show, citing 'the serious and horrific nature of the charges' against the star.
