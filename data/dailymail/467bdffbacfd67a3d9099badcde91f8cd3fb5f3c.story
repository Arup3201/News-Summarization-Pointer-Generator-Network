A car was left suspended over a staircase after its elderly driver smashed into a San Diego children's hospital.

The driver, a 70-year-old, was taken to hospital after his Toyota Camry crashed into Rady Children’s Hospital Wednesday.

Witnesses said the car sped through the car park and hit the building at a high speed - it is thought the accelerator may have become stuck.

Witness Jody Taylor told UT San Diego: 'He was revving the engine like he couldn’t get control of it.'

'He was in midair,' Ms Taylor said.

Ms Taylor rushed over to help the man, telling him to stay still until the emergency services arrived - she also called his daughter.

'What was scary was he was trying to get out of the car,' Ms Taylor said.
