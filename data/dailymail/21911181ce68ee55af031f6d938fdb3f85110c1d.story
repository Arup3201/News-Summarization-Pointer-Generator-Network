Paul Scholes insists he is ready to tell it how it is in his new role as a TV pundit.

But it seems Class of '92 team-mate Gary Neville is already looking to cool him down, after throwing an ice bucket over him. 

Scholes, who upset Wayne Rooney earlier this summer with his scathing views, joined Neville, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, Phil Neville and a host of other Old Trafford favourites for a charity game against non-league Salford City on Thursday night.

Neville threw the ice bucket over Scholes as part of a charity cause for the James McCarthy Foundation - not the Everton midfielder, but a young man who suffered a brain tumour in a car accident and wants to complete his 'bucket list' - and the former United midfielder apparently requested that Darren Fletcher be next in line to be soaked.

The former England midfielder will embark on his latest career turn next week as a pundit for BT Sport in their Premier League curtain-raiser between United and Swansea.

Speaking to Sam Wallace ahead of the launch of his new column in the i and Independent newspapers, he vowed not to change his forthright ways.

'I say it as I think it is. It might upset people,' said Scholes, who will  also join ITV's coverage throughout the new season.

'I don't intend to upset anyone.'

One person Scholes did upset, however, earlier this summer was Wayne Rooney.

The 39-year-old hit the headlines after he suggested Rooney was 'past his best' in an online World Cup column for bookmakers Paddy Power.

Striker Rooney was angered by the cutting comments, saying Scholes had 'upset a lot of people at Manchester United'.

'It was a bit strange, I'll be honest, but he has his opinions and he's entitled to them,' Rooney said in June.

'I'm sure he's upset a lot of people at Man United because they see me as worthy of signing a new deal at the club, so they obviously have got a different opinion to what Paul has.'

But despite the row with Rooney, Scholes is refusing to play Mr Nice Guy this season and added: 'Whether it is right or wrong, it's up to people to decide. But it will be my opinion.'

Scholes, meanwhile, was unable to prevent the United legends losing 5-1 in front of a bumper crowd of over 12,000 in Eccles and was showered with ice cubes by Neville immediately after the defeat.

And speaking to the I and Independent newspapers, he insisted he doesn't miss playing professional football.

'It's not something I think about,' said Scholes, who also admitted that it was Sky Sports star Neville who 'twisted his arm' into following his footsteps when he hung up his boots just over a year ago.

'I think I have handled retirement OK. I will always miss playing but I have to realise I can't go on forever.'

Talent: Many of his team-mates and coaches described him as the most naturally gifted player out of the six
