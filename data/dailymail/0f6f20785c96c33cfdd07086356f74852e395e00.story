Many women can relate to the scene in Sex And The City when Charlotte receives an emergency call from Carrie to escape a bad date.

And now a nifty gadget has been invented so women everywhere can pick up their mobile and say 'Something bad happened?!' without needing to call their friend first.

Whether it's a dodgy suitor or a more dangerous threat, the Guardian Angel is designed as the perfect escape route for women in an uncomfortable situation.

It resembles just a necklace or bracelet, but fosters technology to help the wearer combat harassment

The personal safety accessory line may resemble an elegant silver necklace or bracelet, but it fosters technology which helps the wearer combat harassment and alert their contacts when they are in distress.

Dubbed the Guardian Angel after its halo-like
 design, the device features a special button that can be pressed when 
the wearer is in a precarious situation.

When activated, a call is made
 to the wearer's own mobile phone, allowing her to have an excuse to 
walk away from the harasser in a shared space such as an office or a bar.

Available worldwide, it is suitable for workplaces, social 
settings or even more potentially threatening situations.

If the wearer is particularity worried about their safety, they 
can hold the button for three seconds to send an SOS text message to a 
designated number, such as parents or a friend, to notify them of danger.

The text message even provides coordinates and a Google Map
 link to her exact location.

Fusing technology with style, the Guardian Angel is the brainchild of advertising agency JWT Singapore, in partnership with Singapore-based advocacy organisation Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE).

AWARE works to promote gender equality, including through providing 
counselling and services to women.

'AWARE believes in the rights of women 
to participate in social and public spaces free from harassment and 
violence,' executive director Corinna Lim told Marketing Interactive.

'But 
especially in a workplace or social scenario, there can be social 
penalties for confronting harassers directly.

'The Guardian Angel can 
help to defuse some harassment situations. The emergency contact 
function also empowers women to more easily seek help in cases of 
serious threat.'

Although the Guardian Angel was designed in Singapore, it can be used anywhere in the world and does not require the recipient or wearer to download anything nor have a smartphone.

The Guardian Angel is sold online by Singaporean retailer My 
Room Retail at the-guardianangel.com and 10 per cent of each sale of
 the Guardian Angel will go to AWARE

Create your own 'Something bad happened?!' moment with the Guardian Angel or Bad Date App

eHarmony's Bad Date Rescue App lets users choose an emergency scenario to help them flee from a dodgy suitor.

Be it your mother calling to say your sister is having a baby, your flatmate saying the apartment has sprung a leak, or even your boss requiring your help as 'everything in the office is broken'.

The free app, which is available in the UK and US, will call the user at a pre-scheduled time, or a one-touch 'quick rescue' starting in three seconds, one minute or five minutes, report She Knows.

The phone call looks remarkably convincing when it flashes up on a smartphone, and there's a real (pre-recorded) voice at the other end.

In the final attempt to be fail safe, the app even features a Repeat After Me script, for those whose acting skills aren't perfectly polished, to simply say what the voice tells them to.
