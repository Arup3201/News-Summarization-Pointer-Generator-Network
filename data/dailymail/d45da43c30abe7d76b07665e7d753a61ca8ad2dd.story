The friend of Gemma McCluskie told a jury today how she comforted the soap actress's brother, unaware he had dismembered her body days earlier.

Nicole McLaren said she 'felt sorry' for Tony McCluskie as they searched for his sister in the days following her disappearance in March last year, the Old Bailey heard.

McCluskie, 35, of Shoreditch, east London, denies murdering the 29-year-old, cutting up her body and dumping it in the Regent’s Canal in east London.

Ms McLaren, a neighbour who had known
Miss McCluskie since childhood, told the court that she and the 
defendant visited pubs together where his sister worked in an effort to 
trace her.

She said: 'I was walking ahead in the
street and I heard Tony say, "where’s my sister?" I cuddled him, we 
were holding each other.'

Ms McLaren said she 'felt sorry' for 
McCluskie when his brother Danny reacted angrily over his apparent 
confusion about when he last saw their sister.

'Danny said: "When the f*** did you 
last see Gemma?" I rubbed Tony’s leg because I felt sorry for him. I 
thought he was under pressure. He was nervous.'

Ms McLaren told the court she noticed bandages on McCluskie’s hand shortly after his sister’s disappearance.

'He said he’d had a fight with two fellas outside his house about a fortnight earlier,' she said.

Ms McLaren told defence barrister 
Jeremy Dein QC that she had only seen Miss McCluskie react angrily once,
when she slapped a man in a bar.

She had also exchanged 'heated' messages on Facebook with a woman her boyfriend had been seeing, Ms McLaren said.

A police search of the house 
McCluskie shared with his sister found that entry to her bedroom was 
blocked by piles of clothes, leading officers to believe she was 
hoarding items, the court heard.

When Miss McCluskie was reported 
missing to police, the defendant told officers he was not initially 
concerned when she failed to return home because he believed she was 
staying with a friend.

McCluskie delayed telling her family for days after she vanished.

He is alleged to have killed her on 
March 1 last year before cutting up her body with a meat cleaver and 
dumping it in the nearby Regent’s Canal the following day.

Prosecutors claim he exploded in a 
rage after she threatened to throw him out of the home they shared after
a furious row about his pot smoking.

But in a missing person’s 
report filed the following day, McCluskie told police he had been 
waiting for her to return home from work as normal.

The document, written by officers at Bethnal Green police station in east London, was read to jurors in his murder trial.

It
reads: ‘Tony waited to see if Gemma would come home to get ready for 
work and didn’t contact other family members until March 3 when she had 
not come home from work.

‘Since then the family have contacted Gemma’s work and were told by her boss that she didn’t come into work on March 1.

‘Gemma always has her phone switched on and has never done anything like this before.

‘Her brother thought she had stayed at a friends house on March 1, which is why her brother wasn’t concerned.’

The flat the siblings shared in Pelter Street, Shoreditch, was searched, but Gemma was deemed to be ‘low risk’, the court heard.

The
report continues: ‘There is nothing to say anything has happened to 
Gemma but her family are concerned as this is out of character.’

But it concludes: ‘Although out of character, the subject is an adult.’

Miss McCluskie played Kerry Skinner, the niece of Ethel Skinner, in the BBC soap in 2001.

Her torso was discovered on March 6 and over the next fortnight, her arms and legs were recovered separately from the water.

Her head, which had been dumped in the canal at the same time, was not found until September.

Police discovered that a man with a 
heavy suitcase matching McCluskie’s description had taken a minicab to 
the canal the day after his sister disappeared.

Blood was found in the boot of the 
car and McCluskie’s father and brother 'no doubt with heavy hearts' said
they recognised him from CCTV.

McCluskie admits manslaughter but denies murder, claiming he ‘lost 
control’ during an argument and cannot remember anything.

The trial continues.
