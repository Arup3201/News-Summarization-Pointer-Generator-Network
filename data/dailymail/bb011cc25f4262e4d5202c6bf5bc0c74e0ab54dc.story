Manx sprinter Mark Cavendish is considering taking legal action after Alexander Kristoff accused him of 'crashing on purpose' during stage one of the Tour de France.

Cavendish tried to sprint for the line to claim his first ever leader's yellow jersey in his mother's hometown of Harrogate but he went for a gap that was not there and brought down Simon Gerrans.

But Milan-San Remo winner Kristoff claimed that it was 'not the first time' Cavendish had done things like this before.

And Cavendish's agent, Simon Bayliff, confirmed that the Manxman was considering suing the Katusha rider.

He said: 'He (Cavendish) has has no idea where Kristoff is coming from.

'I would normally say it's best just to let some things go, but this is libellous and we are considering legal action.'

Cavendish was not penalised by any officials for the crash and no

But Kristoff compared Cavendish to footballer Luis Suarez, who was banned for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup, and said his actions appeared deliberate.

Kristoff said: 'Suarez was banned for biting people in soccer and to me it looked like he crashed on purpose.

My fault: Cavendish has taken the blame for causing the crash but he says it was not deliberate

Legal action: Cavendish's agent says the Manxman is considering legal action over the accusations

'I hope he calms down.

'At 60 kilometres per hour it is really dangerous and you might hurt people.

'So it isn't good of him. In an uphill sprint you sometimes lose a little control over your bicycle. It's not the first time he has done this. I hope he will calm down in future.

'He's an excellent sprinter, but it looks like he's losing his head sometimes.'
