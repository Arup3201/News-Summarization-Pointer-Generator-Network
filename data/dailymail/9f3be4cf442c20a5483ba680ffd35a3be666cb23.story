The Hill Of Crosses in northern Lithuania has been a site of pilgrimage for hundreds of years.

Consisting of a hill bristling with hundreds of thousands of crosses of every size and design, it is a powerful testament to religious devotion - where pilgrims descend to plead with Jesus for miracles.

The tradition of leaving crosses began after an uprising against the Russian tsar was put down in 1831.
