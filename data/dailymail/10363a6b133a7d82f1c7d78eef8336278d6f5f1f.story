Holland manager Louis van Gaal cut six players from his provisional World Cup squad just hours before Saturday night’s warm-up match against Ghana.

Van Gaal, who will take over as Manchester United boss after the tournament, decided he didn’t need the friendly in Rotterdam to make a final call on his 23 for Brazil.

Goalkeepers: Jasper Cillessen (Ajax Amsterdam), Tim Krul (Newcastle United), Michel Vorm (Swansea City)

Defenders: Daley Blind (Ajax Amsterdam), Stefan de Vrij, Daryl Janmaat, Terence Kongolo, Bruno Martins Indi (all Feyenoord Rotterdam), Paul Verhaegh (FC Augsburg), Ron Vlaar (Aston Villa), Joel Veltman (Ajax Amsterdam)

Midfielders: Jordy Clasie (Feyenoord Rotterdam), Jonathan de Guzman (Swansea City), Nigel de Jong (AC Milan), Leroy Fer (Norwich City), Arjen Robben (Bayern Munich), Wesley Sneijder (Galatasaray), Georginio Wijnaldum (PSV Eindhoven)

Forwards: Memphis Depay (PSV Eindhoven), Klaas-Jan Huntelaar (Schalke 04), Dirk Kuyt (Fenerbahce), Jeremain Lens (Dynamo Kiev), Robin van Persie (Manchester United).

Chelsea left-back Patrick van Aanholt was one of those cut as Van Gaal decided he didn’t need further back-up in that position.

PSV Eindhoven goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet and four players from the Dutch Under 21 team - Quincy Promes, Jean-Paul Boetius, Karim Rekik and Tonny Vilhenna - were also dropped.

Experienced midfielder Rafael van der Vaart was ruled out on Wednesday after suffering a calf injury during training camp in Portugal.

The chosen 23 includes six Premier League players - Tim Krul, Michel Vorm, Ron Vlaar, Jonathan de Guzman, Leroy Fer and Robin van Persie.

Four members of the squad went to the last two World Cups in Germany and South Africa - Van Persie, Dirk Kuyt, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder - while three just went to the 2010 tournament - Vorm, Nigel de Jong and Klass-Jan Huntelaar.

Holland take on Wales at the Amsterdam ArenA on Wednesday evening, before kicking off their World Cup campaign against defending champions Spain in Salvador on June 13. Australia and Chile make up Group B.
