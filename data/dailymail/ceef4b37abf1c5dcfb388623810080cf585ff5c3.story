Arsene Wenger is determined not to rush Theo Walcott back into action too quickly but will send him away on England duty with his blessing.

Roy Hodgson will receive no special instruction from the Arsenal manager about how to treat the winger who has played only 10 minutes of competitive football since rupturing cruciate knee ligaments in January.

Hodgson has called Walcott into the squad for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and a friendly against Scotland. The winger has not played for England for more than a year.

On whether Walcott will start at Swansea on Sunday, Wenger said: 'If I decide to start he can start.

'He’s available. He has been chosen. He needs competition. He has been out 10 months. People think it’s like a machine. These are human beings and to get back into rhythm of top competition it takes time.

'Roy Hodgson is free to do what he wants. He has been injured in an accidental tackle against Tottenham and you cannot plan that it will never happen again.

'Every time you have a big injury there is a bigger chance of having the next one. He has been taken care of well. We have to leave him in peace and give him time to come back.'

Walcott, in training earlier this week, suffered a serious knee injury in Arsenal's FA Cup win over Tottenham 

Arsenal head to Swansea off the back of a disappointing 3-3 draw against Anderlecht at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday evening.

The Gunners were cruising to victory after goals from Mikel Arteta, Alexis Sanchez and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, but the visitors scored three times inside the final 30 minutes to leave the home fans reeling at the final whistle.

'They were disappointed,' said Wenger of his side after the draw which left Arsenal's bid to top the group in tatters.

'It was a shock straight after game but we know we can score goals and we know we can do better defensively.

'It’s harder to put the first part in the game than the second part. Regardless of the score you have to play the right way.

'We are very positive. Inside our camp we are very positive. We are not touched by the criticism. When we don’t win we are not happy. The rest we can live with.'

Anthony Vanden Borre struck twice for Anderlecht before Aleksandar Mitrovic's last-gasp leveller but the first goal was clearly offside.

And Wenger, who has long been a fan of technology in football, felt let down by the referee's assistant behind Wojciech Szczesny's goal and believes UEFA need to find a better way of making sure the correct decisions are made on the pitch.

'We can learn a lot from what happened on Tuesday,' he said.

'We have special incidents. Some things we can correct, like the second and third goals. But we cannot influence the first goal. When the goalscorers are one yard offside, we cannot influence that.

'Every time we go to Geneva, (Pierluigi) Collina (UEFA's chief refereeing officer) explains to us that the fifth referee is a fantastic finding.

'But when you see the pictures on the first goal, it is unbelievable. A guy stands behind the line in front of the offside guy and does not stay a word.

'I do not know what the guys behind the line are paid for. That is a general feeling shared by everyone who watches football. They should buy a seat for them, and give them a good book!'

Wenger also labelled any of the criticism aimed at his side following the slip-up as 'predictable' after former Gunners favourite Paul Merson said the team were 'tactically clueless'.

'If you are 3-0 up and get back to 3-3, you always get the same,' Wenger said when asked about the criticism.

'I have managed 2,000 games and can anticipate what people will say. If you defend and get back to 3-3, people will ask why you defend and not continue to play a normal game. If you continue to attack, people ask why you attack. It is so predictable.'
