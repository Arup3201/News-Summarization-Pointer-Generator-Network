Abducted: Skylar Jardin, five, was taken from his Oregon home at 6am today allegedly by his mother's ex-boyfriend

A five-year-old boy was abducted from his home today after his mother and father were brutally  attacked with a hammer, authorities said.

Skylar Coulcer-Jarding was taken from his rural home at 6am this morning.

His parents Josh Allen Jarding and Gayleen Riter were beaten with a hammer by Bryan Lester DePriest, police said.

DePriest, an ex-boyfriend of Miss Riter, allegedly snatched the child in The Dalles and fled the scene in a stolen car.

The kidnapping sparked an Amber Alert across the state of Oregon.

The boy was found unharmed a few hours later with DePriest in Dufur, a town 15 miles south of The Dalles in Wasco County.

DePriest, 36, was arrested and is being held by police on suspicion of home invasion and kidnapping.

He has not yet been charged, according to Oregon police.

He is being held at the Northern Oregon Regional Correctional Facility.

Miss Riter, 30, had a restraining order against DePriest at the time he allegedly took her son. The 36-year-old already has a criminal record.

Miss Riter and her partner Mr Jarding, also 30, were treated for their injuries at Mid-Columbia Medical Center and later released.

Skylar was also checked out by doctors but found to be unharmed. He was later returned to his parents.
