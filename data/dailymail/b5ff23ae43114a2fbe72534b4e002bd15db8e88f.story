Teetering precariously over the edge of the bridge, a truck carrying ten brand new lorry cabs sits just millimetres from tipping into the valley below.

Fortunately, nobody was injured when the heavy load smashed over a safety railing and came to a halt on the edge of the bridge in Kaili city, in China's Guizhou province.

Despite being faced with a sheer drop, the driver and his passenger managed to clamber from the cab of their vehicle and climb back over the top of the truck's load to the safety of the bridge.

On the edge: A trailer loaded with brand new trucks hangs precariously over the precipice of a bridge in Kaili, in the Guizhou Province of China

Left hanging: The accident happened when the lorry driver was forced to give way to another driver and couldn't avoid crashing through the safety barrier

No one hurt: Fortunately, the driver and his passenger managed to scramble from the vehicle unhurt following the crash

The incident happened when the driver of the truck was forced to swerve to avoid another driver who cut him up.

Despite his best efforts to avoid the precipice, the driver was unable to stop the truck careering towards the safety barrier and partially crashing through it.

The men inside the cab made it safely back on to the bridge before calling emergency crews.

The road remained closed for several hours while recovery crews hauled the truck and its load back from the edge and on to an even bigger trailer to be towed away.

Recovery operation: The road was closed for several hours while the load was secured and then dragged back onto the bridge, and then the safety rail needed to be put back in place

Once the lorry was recovered, further delays were caused when the bridge's safety rails had to be replaced.

A police spokesman said: 'Another few centimetres and the whole lot would have gone over, it was a lucky escape.'

Although the driver and his passenger were given a scare by the incident, they probably had a slightly less terrifying escape than a truck driver in the Gansu Province of China last autumn.

He was left dangling upside down over a 30ft drop when his lorry flipped and landed on the edge of a bridge.

Close call: A police spokesman described the fact that the trucks didn't tumble over the edge as 'a lucky escape'

Lucky escape: The two men in the lead truck were faced with a sheer drop and had to clamber back over the load to safety

With his right leg wedged between the 
truck and the bridge, Driver Dong Yinan's landing saved him from a 
deadly fall to the ground.

Passers-by looked on as Mr Yinan flailed as he hung on to ropes with his legs split in midair.

The truck, carrying 30 tons of coal, threatened to topple over the edge leaving Mr Yinan holding on for dear life.

Firefighters
 had the tricky task of reaching him safely from under the teetering 
truck and it took them three hours to rescue the driver.
