Japan’s Ayako Uehara mastered the windy conditions at Royal Birkdale to lead after the opening round of the Ricoh Women’s British Open on Thursday.

Uehara recovered from a bogey on her first hole to fire five birdies in an opening four-under-par 68, finishing one shot ahead of American Mo Martin.

Martin birdied three of the last five holes to return a 69, with compatriots Mina Harigae and Morgan Pressel and Australian Sarah Kemp another shot back on two under.

World No 1 and defending champion Stacy Lewis returned a 71 matched by England’s Holly Clyburn as only nine players broke par and more than a dozen took more than 80. Scotland’s Kylie Walker birdied the last for an 82 which started with a quintuple bogey nine on the first.

US Women’s Open champion Michelle Wie could only manage a three-over-par 75 featuring five bogeys and two birdies.

'I definitely felt like my tempo was a little bit off,' Wie said. 'I just didn’t hit good shots today but it’s a long way until Sunday. It could have been a lot worse.'

Solheim Cup star Charley Hull returned a 73 while 50-year-old Laura Davies finished double bogey, bogey, birdie in a 75.Uehara was pleased with her opening round and believes improved putting was the key to her success.

'I had many good birdie chances but I couldn’t make it,' she said. 'But this week, so good, so I have confidence right now.'

Kemp had not played the famous Southport course, which will host the Open Championship in 2017, before and admitted she was pleased that the weather was kind.

'I think it’s one of the hardest golf courses I’ve ever played,' she said.

'We were lucky today with the weather. It wasn’t as windy. But I played yesterday, a practice round, and it was pretty windy.

'It’s quite tight and it’s so intimidating off the tee. There are a lot of shots where you can’t see the ball land and when you get up there, the fairway looks about 10 yards wide, so it’s definitely up there with the top five hardest golf courses I’ve ever played. But, one of the best golf courses I’ve ever played, too.'
