Roy Keane was at the centre of a storm  following an alleged row with a fan at the team hotel in Dublin.

Reports that Keane was involved in a bust-up with a fan outside the bar area in the team hotel in Portmarnock spread like wildfire.

But the FAI insisted the reports were ‘inaccurate’ and they stood by their man, revealing that Keane himself had notified the Gardai of the incident.

The FAI were adamant the Corkman had their ‘full support’ and that of manager, Martin O’Neill, also.

According to well-placed sources in the Ireland camp, the incident was blown out of proportion. 

Contrary to social media rumours, no players were involved.

In a statement released late on Wednesday night, the FAI said: ‘Following inaccurate media reports which refer to an incident involving a member of the public this evening at the Republic of Ireland team hotel, we wish to clarify that Roy Keane called the Gardai following the incident.
