Sentenced: Judith Oakes, 48, was sentenced to five years in prison on Thursday for stealing $1.8 million

A Los Angeles school accountant who caught on camera stuffing lunch money in her bra and in a large bag is thought to have stolen $1.8m over eight years, a court heard this week.

Judith Oakes, 48, was sentenced to five years in prison on Thursday for stealing the lunch money from the Rialto Unified School District.

She was ordered to pay $1.845 million in restitution for stealing the cash.

Oakes was arrested on August 8, 2013 on suspicion of grand theft, embezzlement and burglary and then resigned from her job a day later.

Judith Oakes pleaded guilty to stealing the funds from the Rilato Unified School District in December.

Oakes' salary was just $77,000 a year but she still managed to live a lavish lifestyle with the help from the lunch money she stole. 

The Los Angeles Times reports that she had two homes, took expensive vacations, and owned several vehicles.

Police say she financed her big spends with cash she lifted from 29 different district schools.

The thefts of the $1.8m dated back to 2008, and Police believe she stole over $3m during her 25 year career.

'She took very expensive and lavish trips to concerts, sporting events,' Rialto Police Capt. Randy de Anda said.

NBC reports that Oakes had a monthly credit card bill of $10,000 to $12,000, which she always paid in full with cash.

The district is changing their policies to make sure this doesn't happen again.

'There are a lot of procedural changes that we have already implemented since this had happened,' said Syeda Jafri of the Rialto Unified School District.

Guilty: Judith Oakes, 48, was sentenced to five years in prison on Thursday for stealing $1.8 million in lunch money from the Rialto Unified School District during the month of December 2013
