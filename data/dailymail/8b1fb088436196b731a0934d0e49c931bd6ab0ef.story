If dogs are a man's best friend, they are a saviour for anxious travellers.

At least that's what Edmonton International Airport (EIA) in the Canadian province of Alberta is hoping after welcoming dogs into its terminal to help calm stressed or nervous passengers.

Since spring this year, groups of pet therapy dogs have visited the airport several times a week in an alliance between the airport and the Pet Therapy Society of Northern Alberta.

The society also uses dogs and other trained animals including cats and rabbits in hospitals, nursing homes, schools and correctional facilities.

The animals are  used to make people enduring difficult situations feel a little less stressed.

Black Labradors, golden retrievers and bulldogs, brought in by their volunteer owners, patrol the terminal, where they stop to interact with passengers and staff.

'Travel really can be a stressful experience,' said Heather Hamilton, EIA's director of communications.

​'I think the more ways we can inject a little fun and relaxation into it is definitely something our passengers appreciate.'

Volunteers wear black T-shirts with 'Pet Therapy EIA' written on and the dogs wear turquoise neckerchiefs.

'I've had people cry. Hug the dog,'  Lori Goodwin, the volunteer director of the Pet Therapy Society, told CBCNews.

Meeting of minds: Dog therapy has been used in schools and universities in the UK, US and Canada

'The smiles and tears really make the day, it really does.'

While this is the first of its kind in Canada, a similar service is offered at a few US airports, including Los Angeles' PUP Program and San Francisco International Airport's Wag Brigade.

Dog therapy has been used in schools and universities in the UK, US and Canada to ease stress during exam periods with 'puppy rooms' for students to spend time in.
