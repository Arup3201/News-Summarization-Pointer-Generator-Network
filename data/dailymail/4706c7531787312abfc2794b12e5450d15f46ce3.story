Scotland's Highland Council has shocked locals and visitors with a proposed 'tourist tax' on overnight stays as part of a plan to slash regional spending by £64million.

The controversial proposition to charge a fee, which could be £1 per room per night, is just one of many money-saving motions being considered as the local authority attempts to balance its books.

The 'tourist tax' would be imposed at hotels, guesthouses and B&Bs, and the levy would be used to pay for infrastructure used by holidaymakers.

However, the Scottish government and tourism body, VisitScotland, aren't so sure that it would be beneficial.

They fear that the tax could badly damage the Highlands' tourism industry, which is largely considered to be the area's lifeblood. 

Local Councillor Maxine Smith said: 'This is going out to consultation to see if it's something that the public would be favourable towards.

'If so, we would have talks with the Scottish government to get permission to go ahead.'

But VisitScotland has already publicly urged the council to drop the idea. 

Regional director, Scott Armstrong, said: 'The introduction of this tax would be detrimental to the tourism industry and is not something we would support.'

Tourism is hugely important to the Scottish economy and especially to the Highlands, where millions of visitors flock to from all over the world every year.

Mr Armstrong added: 'An initiative like this is likely to resort in higher prices for visitors and have a negative impact on the sector.' 

Stewart Nicol, chief executive of Inverness Chamber of Commerce, agrees: 'I understand the challenges being faced by the council, but I am not sure that a tourism tax would be an appropriate way of raising finance.'

Mr Nicol also pointed out that many tourism-focused businesses already pay a levy through the Inverness and Loch Ness Tourism Business Improvement District.

'This idea means that we would not be looking for ways to develop tourism business or the experience in the Highlands,' he added. 'It is a way to pay for services that are already there.'

Willie Cameron, of Loch Ness Marketing, said he is against a tax being administered by the council.

He added that if such a scheme was allowed it should be run by communities with the money going towards local initiatives to improve tourism.

David Richardson, development manager of the Federation of Small Businesses, also spoke out against the proposed tax: 'The FSB understands the challenges faced by Highland Council. However, where a tourism tax has been discussed elsewhere in Scotland, specifically Edinburgh, it has consistently been rejected.'

Mr Richardson also questions how such a tax could be administered cost-effectively and fairly, where the money would be spent, and what the impact would be on local businesses in terms of their long-term competitiveness in the tourism sector.

'These are the sorts of questions that need to be answered before this proposal can go any further,' he said.

Four years ago, Aberdeen City Council included plans for a bed tax on hotels in its draft budget - but the idea was quickly dropped after hotel operators said it could put them out of business. 

As of now, the Scottish government does not see such a Highlands 'tourism tax' moving forward.

A spokeswoman for the government said: 'The Scottish government has no plans to add any new tax burdens on the tourism sector and there are no existing legal powers for local authorities to levy a local bed tax or tourism tax.

'We would not support the introduction of new taxes on tourists.'
