Universities are having to employ teams of social media experts because students are no longer using email

Universities are being forced to employ Twitter and Facebook experts in order to communicate effectively with students claiming they don't respond to emails anymore.

Exeter University say they now have a social media team on call 24 hours a day, responding to inquiries from students with other institutions adopting similar set-ups.

Tech-savvy youngsters armed with the latest smartphones no longer bother with emails - which are viewed as slow and outdated - preferring to tweet requests for help or advice instead.

And unlike emails where they can often wait days for a reply, with Twitter the students expect an immediate response.

A spokesman for the University of Exeter said: 'Just as sending a letter is no longer the most efficient way of communicating with students, social media has eclipsed email in many respects to become their preferred method of getting in touch with us.

'We are a student-led institution and aim to respond to their needs in the most convenient format for them – be it Twitter, Facebook or SMS. As new technologies and platforms emerge, we will adjust our means of communication to reflect them.

'Another benefit to engaging in this way is that other students who may have the same question can see the response.'

Twitter
 can be used to create lively interactive forums for individual courses 
where student's can discuss and debate the latest issues and share 
reading recommendations.

On call: Exeter University has a social media team available 24 hours a day to respond to Twitter and Facebook requests

Twitter
 accounts have been compulsory for PR students at the University of 
Greenwich, for several years, where they are viewed as an essential tool
 for keeping up to date with the syllabus.

But
 the technology can also mean extra pressure for tutors, as students are
 now able to Tweet criticism of boring lectures and uninspiring staff.

Research
 on students' online usage published last year found that laptops are 
rapidly being replaced by smartphones and tablets as the primary device 
for accessing the internet.

Exeter University Vice Chancellor Sir Steven Smith said students expect an immediate response to their tweets

The Global Marketing Trends report also found that 75 per cent of European students admitted to using Twitter 'all the time' with the figure for Facebook even higher at 81 per cent.

Birmingham university has responded by creating a virtual learning environment called Canvas offering digital quizzes and recordings of lectures which students access can access using their phones.

Katie Connoly, Birmingham University's digital marketing communications manager said she believes students have turned to social media because it is faster than email.

She said: 'We’ve noticed a big increase in social media usage over the past 18 months. We’ve gained around 65 per cent of our audiences on Facebook and Twitter since August 2012.

'Engaging with our students on social media is hugely rewarding. You get a real sense of community on our social media channels that reflects our real-life campus community.

'And although students have high expectations on social media, they are often very grateful to us if we can help them in any way.

'The range of inquiries we get is huge – from prospective students looking for course information to current students wanting to know their exam timetables.'
