In the final column of the season, the World of Cricket hands out its annual awards for the good, the bad and the ridiculous...

Best newcomer

A difficult category with Moeen Ali, Jos Buttler and Chris Jordan all highly commended but it has to be Gary Ballance. It was Graham Gooch who first enthusiastically advocated him but early evidence in Australia left the jury out. 

Then Peter Moores decided, surprisingly, that he should bat at three for the first Test of the summer and the rest… an average of 60 after his first eight Tests, the first five of them without a victory, with three hundreds and another three half centuries is Bradmanesque and the biggest tribute you can pay to Ballance is that Jonathan Trott has not been missed.

Excellent catcher, too. Just has to make sure he leaves his shirt on when visiting Nottingham bars.

Put your shirt on him: Ballance has been superb at No 3 - now he just has to watch himself in nightclubs

Best performer in a leading role

No problem for the judges this time. Has to be Jimmy Anderson. What a season for a man who became man of the series against Sri Lanka despite not being at his very best and ending it in tears after just failing to hang on for a draw at Headingley. 

Life was just as eventful for Jimmy against India, first when he batted for nearly four hours at Trent Bridge, clashed with Ravindra Jadeja, wasted perfect conditions at Lord’s and then gloriously set new standards in the last three Tests. He stands just three wickets away from Sir Ian Botham’s Test record and is a national treasure.

Most ill-advised judgment call

MS Dhoni’s obsession with getting Anderson banned for whatever happened away from the public eye in the Trent Bridge pavilion. The Indian captain’s arrogant assumption that he can do what he wants was embarrassingly rejected by judge Gordon Lewis who threw out the serious Level Three charge in just 10 minutes, with around £200,000 wasted on lawyers. 

Think what good that could have done in grass-roots cricket. Meanwhile, India seemed to lose all focus while concentrating on Dhoni’s righteous indignation and were a rabble by The Oval.

Most ill-judged on-field incident

Has to be the ‘Mankading’ of Buttler by Sachithra Senanayake at Edgbaston in an attempt to avenge what Sri Lanka saw as an English conspiracy to report his bowling action. Forget all this business about it being in the rules. 

It was a crass piece of cricket which spoilt the otherwise highly impressive impression that Angelo Mathews made as a young and ultimately triumphant captain. Mathews, who led his side to victory in all three formats, was definitely both the overseas player and captain of the season. 

Ill-judged: Sachithra Senanayake 'Mankads' Jos Buttler, which sparked a row between England and Sri Lanka

Hidden gem of the season

Of the many huge decisions that Paul Downton had to make in his first couple of months as managing director one of the best and least heralded was persuading Paul Farbrace to swap the head coach’s job with Sri Lanka to become Moores' assistant in a new coaching line-up. The former Kent director of cricket is the perfect foil for Moores and has quickly become a significant figure in the England set-up. Has a great perspective on the ups and downs of cricketing life, too, after being caught up in the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore five years ago.

Most significant newcomer

Unquestionably Moeen. Went to meet him in a Birmingham school in May and was immediately impressed by his character. In desperate times in the Middle East, Moeen can be such a positive role model for Islam in this country as well as an inspiration for all British Asians. 

He does not push his religion down anyone’s throats either, as some have suggested, but he is very much a proud, modern Englishman. He can bat and bowl, too.

Modern Englishman: Moeen Ali is a positive role model for British Asians... and a good all-rounder, too

Most significant innings

Buttler’s incredible 121 off 74 balls in a losing cause against Sri Lanka at Lord’s was a game changer in so many ways. Before then James Foster was in line to keep wicket in this season’s Tests should Matt Prior not recover full fitness. 

England understandably gave Prior another chance as part of their senior spine but he was never fully fit and the introduction of Buttler to Test cricket at Southampton was a highly significant moment. He has proved since he can build an innings as well as explode out of the blocks while, with the exception of Old Trafford, his keeping has been outstanding. 

He really can become England’s answer to Adam Gilchrist.

Prospective most exciting newcomer

Alex Hales has the potential to do for England what David Warner did for Australia, progress from a Twenty20 specialist all the way to dynamic Test opener. But first he will have to prove he can do it in 50-over cricket against India, Sri Lanka and then the World Cup. Five centuries for Notts in all competitions this season show Hales is ready for promotion and he seems to have matured as a character which was necessary when a lack of self-discipline threatened to stall his progress.

Most unlucky cricketer not to be called up

Has to be Hales' Notts colleague James Taylor. When he smashed an unbeaten hundred against Middlesex off 55 balls last week in front of not one selector but two in Mick Newell and Angus Fraser his return to the one-day squad seemed assured. But no. There appears to be a theory that he only produces the goods in TV matches. Well, all international games are on the telly. Highly commended in this category is Ravi Bopara – still astonished that he has lost his one-day place.

Most impressive county

Yorkshire. They are setting the standards for everyone else to match, not just in leading the way in the county championship but the way they are developing so many players for the England team, including one in Liam Plunkett who seemed to be going nowhere at Durham. There are more to come too. Alex Lees is high on England’s agenda while Adil Rashid is back on their radar. A strong Yorkshire makes for a strong England? It is as true today as ever.

The last laugh award

Few England captains have had to cope with as much opprobrium as Alastair Cook, not only from irrelevant nasty voices on Twitter but also when as many as six former England captains said he should quit after the low point of Lord’s defeat by India. 

He may have considered packing it all in but he battled on, maintaining his dignity throughout, and what the bulk of England cricket followers rather than the loud mouthed minority thought of him became clear in the enthusiastic support he received from Test crowds everywhere, particularly Southampton. 

Needless to say, I had the last laugh: Alastair Cook was heavily criticised by most following the series defeat by Sri lanka and a 10-Test winless run but ended up captaining England to a series victory over India

The England team are in a position to grow now in a positive healthy environment created by Cook, Moores and Farbrace. It had to be done after Australia and thankfully Cook is still at the helm to carry it through. 

Newman’s final word

The schedules facing England over the next 18 months are madness, as we have highlighted in these pages, and there was a strong case for Alastair Cook and Jimmy Anderson to be rested for the five-match one-day international series against India. 

Clearly, this is the start of the build-up to the World Cup but the pair could have come back refreshed either in Sri Lanka in November or the new year in the triangular series against Australia and India. They need to be looked after, as Stuart Broad must be when he returns after knee surgery. Otherwise our best players will be finished by early 2016.

The good - England eventually re-engaged with the public. It took a while but there was a massive response from the senior players while the many emerging younger ones delivered immediately. Alastair Cook won the day and proved emphatically that behind every good man is a woman – or a farmer’s wife in Alice’s case. Sounds like the Cooks should be in Emmerdale!

The bad - The continued hike of Test match prices which is the single most emotive topic on my Twitter timeline. The bidding system to stage Tests is flawed and it is an absolute disgrace that there will be no Ashes Test next summer in the north of England. And a consequence of the system is that there seems to be a total disregard for the wishes of the England team when it comes to preparing Test pitches. Sort it out, ECB.
