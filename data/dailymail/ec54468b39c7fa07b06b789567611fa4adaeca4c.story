An extravagant mansion built on the site of Alexander Hamilton's duel with Aaron Burr has been snapped off the market for a cool $6,200,000.

The patch of land on New Jersey's Gold Coast played host to one of the most influential moments in US political history.

Now, it has been transformed into a marble-paneled monument with panoramic views of New York City's skyline.

Majestic: This is a glimpse of the panoramic view of Manhattan from the mansion built on the site where Alexander Hamilton was killed

Idyllic: The new owners can recline among the shrubbery on their private terrace while taking in the buzz of New York City

Historic: The opulent rooms are decked in oak wood, marble and gold, with wrought iron railings outside in neoclassical style

Designed just 12 years ago, it was fashioned in the neoclassical style popular in the early 19th century when Hamilton was fatally shot by his political nemesis. 

The distinctive Mansard roof and dormer windows pay homage to France’s Second Empire, while the interior boasts the perfect combination of modern luxuries and comfort.

The 7,200-square-foot floor plan is divided into four bedrooms, a gym, an extravagant office, and a private terrace with gaping windows looking out over the Hudson River. 

Guests will be given a regal entry via a majestic foyer, which opens out onto the main salon, dining room, and library.

Three marble wood-burning fireplaces are dotted through the living space, and a multi-zone radiant heater has been installed for winter. 

Pivotal moment: Many say Alexander Hamilton (right) deliberately missed when he and Aaron Burr (center) dueled in 1804

Vibrant: The gold-lined property with handing chandeliers is a tribute to Hamilton, one of the shining stars in America's political history

A casual dinner: The new owners will enjoy their evening meal on this mezzanine floor with a gaping view of the Hudson River

Budding chefs? Perhaps the buyer has a penchant for home cooking as their $6,200,000 has bagged them a deluxe kitchen

Master: One of the three marble wood-burning fireplaces is set in this master bedroom. There are two other master suites in the home

Luxurious details also include a private elevator, surround sound, and two garages.

Hopefully the new owner has a taste for cooking and will no doubt be delighted by the gourmet chef's kitchen, butler's pantry and grilling patio.

The three master suites feature marble baths, high ceilings and vast closet space. A fourth bedroom could also double up as a game room.

And it is just minutes from Manhattan via the NY Waterway Ferry, NJ Transit or Lincoln Tunnel.

Regal: Built 12 years ago, the home was designed to echo the extravagant early 1800s, with modern touches such as surround sound

Modern touch: This living area with 1960s style furniture maintains the golden theme and has french windows leading out to the terrace

Playing around: With a pool table and gym equipment, there is plenty in the way of activities for an energetic homeowner

The dazzling property in New Jersey's King's Bluff area is something of a tribute to Hamilton, one of the stars of America's political history. 

Decades younger than Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, Hamilton was an intellectual wonder child.

His rise to political glory, as America's first Secretary to the Treasury, was rapid and his word was highly influential.

When voters cottoned on to his distaste for Vice President Burr, they were quick to back him.

Relax: If the homeowner tires of gazing at the stars or the skyline through that gold telescope, they can flop on this plush velvet couch

Spell-binding: At night, the bright white house which is lined with trimmed rows of hedges and potted plants, gleams 

But in 1804, he made another dig at Burr who was running for New York governor. And by that point, Burr had had enough.

As per the times, he challenged Hamilton to the duel that would kill him.

Many say Hamilton deliberately missed Burr when they drew shotguns. But Burr's struck Hamilton and he died the next day.

In the decades since, Hamilton Avenue, as it is now called, has played host to numerous re-enactments and people from all over the United States travel to pay homage to the revered politician at King's Bluff. 

It was on the market with Douglas Elliman for an asking price of $7,500,000.
