A £1.5billion rescue plan for the Co-operative Bank will slash the income of thousands of pensioners, it emerged yesterday.

The 169-year-old bank will be floated on the stock market to plug a giant hole in its balance sheet.

It hopes to raise £1billion in a mix of shares and bonds, plus a further £500million by selling its general insurance arm.

But the Co-op Group, which has 4.7million customers and whose interests run from funerals to pet insurance, wants savers who own its bonds to help foot the bill. Up to 7,000 who handed over a chunk of their life savings will lose out.

As part of its grand plan, the Co-op will no longer pay income to its bondholders, most of whom are retired.

Some were being paid as much as 13 per cent in annual interest – or £1,300 for a £10,000 investment.

Instead, in exchange for their bonds, 
investors will be offered either a cash payoff, shares in the new bank, 
or new bonds. But they face losing 35p for each £1 of Co-op bonds they 
hold.

The price of many bonds has halved over the past couple of months, leaving thousands out of pocket. Bonds worth £60million are held by individual investors, paying annual interest of 5.5 to 13 per cent.

These bonds are a type of investment, and not to be confused with the fixed-rate savings-account bonds offered in branches.

Known as retail bonds, they are simply an IOU written to investors to raise funds for business growth.

In return for money, the lender pays savers interest.

Patrick Connolly, of financial adviser Chase de Vere, said: ‘Many people will have considered these Co-op bonds to be safe, but this highlights just how much of a huge risk there can be when investing. I fear there will be more pain as they’ll be forced to accept further losses as part of the rescue plans.’

The bailout follows months of setbacks for the Co-op.

In March, it revealed a £600million loss as a result of having to pay compensation for the mis-sale of payment protection insurance, and losses on bad loans.

The following month, it pulled out of a bid for 632 Lloyds branches.

Then in May, a downgrade from the ratings agency Moody’s saw the bank’s debt being given ‘junk’ status.

The Mail also revealed it had put a halt to new lending to small firms.

Analysis by Alex Brummer, City Editor

The implosion at the Co-operative Bank that will wipe out the savings of thousands of smaller investors and trusts is the result of hubris and mismanagement on a mammoth scale.

Instead of the ultimate owners of the bank – the wealthy Co-operative movement – digging into its own coffers, it is the bondholders who are being asked to carry the can.

It is the closest Britain has come to a Cyprus-style rescue in which ordinary investors are made to pay for errors of management and government.

The crisis at the so-called ethical bank is the result of political interference in decision-making and inadequate banking disciplines.

This has left a £1.5billion black hole in the bank’s balance sheet, placed the whole Co-operative movement at risk and created huge uncertainty for the bank’s 4.7million customers.

Successive governments have contributed to the crisis. It was Gordon Brown’s administration that sought to back a new ‘super-mutual’ bank as a challenger on the high street.

The Labour Party’s favourite bank, the Co-operative, was chosen as its preferred vehicle and the Government backed a 2009 merger with the much larger Britannia Building Society.

Dozens of Labour MPs, including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, are sponsored by the Co-op movement.

The Britannia deal turned out to be a disaster. Large numbers of mortgages on the Britannia’s books were rotten and the society had become embroiled in commercial property deals that went wrong in the recession. Much of this was hidden from public view until George Osborne gave the nod to the Co-operative Bank bid for 632 Lloyds branches.

The former Financial Services Authority should have stepped in and made it clear that the Co-op lacked the management and balance sheet resources to enter the big league.

Not surprisingly the deal fell apart when the Co-op revealed heavy property losses and acknowledged it lacked the systems to manage the bank.

It was then that credit ratings agency Moody’s downgraded the bank’s debt to ‘junk’ status. That meant traditional customers, such as local authorities and non-governmental organisations, could no longer safely hold deposits with the bank.

Under the complex rescue package just unveiled by the Co-op after extensive talks with the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulatory Authority watchdog, it is bondholders rather than the Co-op movement who will bear most of the pain.

That has left investors in the bonds angry, disappointed and disillusioned with both the Co-op and the government that allowed this series of catastrophic errors to happen.
