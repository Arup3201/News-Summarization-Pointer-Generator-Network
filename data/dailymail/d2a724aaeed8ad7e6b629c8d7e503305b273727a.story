Back at his swish penthouse apartment in Canary Wharf, Sam Allardyce would have rocked back on his settee and let out an enormous belly laugh. He is the biggest winner here.

This is the Arsenal team West Ham’s manager wants to face on December 28, the one who cannot defend a set-piece for love nor money. What a charitable bunch Arsene Wenger’s men can be.

It was a seasonal slip-up, conceding a 97th-minute equaliser when poor Calum Chambers was bamboozled out of the way by Martin Skrtel.

Kieran Gibbs had done his Arsenal team-mate no favours, moving off his designated station at the near post when Adam Lallana slung in a corner that was met by the bandaged head of the Liverpool defender. Allardyce will love that, confirmation that this Arsenal team, for all their good form of late, are capable of conceding at any stage of the game.

In the post-match analysis Wenger admitted that there were ‘tactical and psychological reasons’ behind this awkward performance at Anfield.

Tactically, truth be told, they were pretty much played off the park by a Liverpool side who have yet to decide whether they are in transition or whether they can still finish in the top four.

The psychological reasons that Wenger alluded to were the visions — make that nightmares — of the 5-1 defeat Liverpool inflicted here last season.

It seems incredible to think that a team Brendan Rodgers believes are one of the best in Europe can be so vulnerable mentally.

There is enough experience in this team, enough medals between them to do a bit better than this. When they concede like this you wonder what are they being taught at training.

Those five West Ham strikers Allardyce has been talking about probably can’t wait to get among this Arsenal defence at Upton Park in a few days’ time.

That game is shaping up to be a shootout for the Champions League, an invigorating clash between Allardyce’s upstarts and this vulnerable Arsenal defence. The stats that West Ham’s manager love so much would have been in one hand and a large glass of 1986 Petrus Pomerol in the other. Allardyce will drink to this.

Arsenal had only 35 per cent possession here, shut down every time the playmakers — Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sanchez — got on the ball.

At one stage during a first half that was dominated in its entirety by Liverpool, there was a 10-minute period when Rodgers’ team enjoyed 87 per cent of the play. That is impressive for Liverpool, enough for Rodgers to describe their performance as better than last year’s 5-1. At one stage he even called it ‘brilliant’.

Still, that is no excuse for a team who were leading 2-1 when referee Michael Oliver signalled that there would be nine minutes of added time because of the earlier injury sustained to Skrtel’s head.

Chambers is struggling, returning from suspension to take his place at right back in defence.

‘We are guilty because we didn’t jump at all with Skrtel,’ admitted Wenger, but there was more to it than just a simple challenge inside the penalty area from a corner.

You always fancy your chances against this back four and the kid is offered zero protection by Oxlade-Chamberlain, the man immediately in front of him.

These are two youngsters and yet they need to develop an instinctive relationship, a protective cloak if they are to form a partnership down the right in the years to come.

Without it they will be targeted, as they were here by the lung-busting first-half runs of Lazar Markovic. On the ball, Liverpool were sharp and inventive again.

‘There were memories from last season and maybe it played a part,’ admitted Wenger.

‘We let them come at us and when you don’t score a third you can never relax.’

Instead, they left Allardyce and his West Ham team sitting pretty.
