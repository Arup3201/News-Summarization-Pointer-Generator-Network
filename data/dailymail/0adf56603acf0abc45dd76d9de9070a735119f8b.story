She was described as a warm and caring young woman, with a love for children, a good Christian upbringing and plenty of friends.

But a judge has ordered a sentence of 25 years to life in prison for Courtney Kathleen Addington, the 25-year-old who hid her pregnancy from those around her, stuffed her newborn baby in a garbage and left it under her bed until it died.

Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Sharon A. Lueras delivered a powerful and emotional speech when handing down her sentence after a 12-person jury found Addington guilty of first-degree murder.

Addington secretly gave birth in the bedroom of her family home in Rosemont, California, earlier this year, hiding her pregnancy from those around her by telling them she had been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome.

The night before the birth she had done internet searches on signs of labor and water breakage.

Then on the morning January 25, Addington's father found her bleeding profusely.

Courtney Kathleen Addington, 25, said in her defense that she did not know she was pregnant and believed that the birth was a 'bowel movement', despite police discovering she had done internet searches on her phone about signs of labor and water breakage

Frail: Courtney Addington was motionless when her sentence was handed down in court. She was arrested about 8.45pm on January 25. She gave birth that morning in secret in her bedroom

She told him and emergency room personnel it was the result of a bowel movement.

But staff at Mercy General Hospital determined she had recently given birth.

The matter was reported to police, who searched Addington's house that night.

Under the bed they found a white garbage with the lifeless body of a newborn inside, the umbilical chord and placenta still attached.

In another bag they found some bloody towels.

She had given birth to the seven-pound, eight-ounce girl who was later given the name Hayden Elaine Addington Minton.

'I have to stand here for Baby Hayden and let her know her life mattered, and her mother must (be held accountable) for ending her life in a cruel and callous way,' Judge Lueras told the court, according to the Sacramento Bee.

'I see this beautiful young woman, who by all accounts is a caring young woman.

'You don’t look like your typical defendant, sitting there.

The thought of baby Hayden Elaine gasping for air, the judge said after pausing briefly to compose herself, is 'unconscionable and it’s haunting'.

'It was a live girl. She was 7 pounds,' Judge Lueras said.

'You put her in a plastic bag ... and you left that baby to die.'

Lueras said she wished she could put Addington on probation and recommend counseling.

But her 'horrible choice' merited something far more severe – the maximum possible prison term of 25 years to life.

The sentence came down in front of a packed, emotional courtroom audience. On one side sat Addington’s parents, friends and family, who maintained the young woman’s innocence in tearful testimonies before Lueras.

'I love her dearly, and this is so wrong,' her father, Darren Addington, said.

'It’ll be found out in the end.'

On the other of the aisle sat the baby’s father, John Minton, and his family and friends.

Several members of the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department sat among them.

Minton said he was not there to ask for a harsh penalty or leniency for his former girlfriend, who he said betrayed his trust.

'I ask only that we remember what brought us to where we are, and we remember my daughter Hayden Elaine,' he said, before returning to his seat and melting into quiet sobs.

Minton posted on Facebook after the sentencing, thanking people for their supported and apologizing for his distant behavior.

'I wanted to say, that I am sorry to all of you who i have kept at arm's length over the course of this last year,' he wrote online.

'It has been a trying one, and the pain is not over for me. But the reason that i kept you all away from me these many months is linked below. I was unable to talk about it, but will answer any questions you have now. It's over. Hayden is resting in peace now.'

In representing Addington during the trial, attorney Jesse Ortiz said the woman did not know she was pregnant, lost consciousness because of heavy bleeding during the birth and bagged up the body believing it was the final remnants of her irritable bowel syndrome.

On Friday, he continued his defense by filing a motion for a new trial, arguing that deputies illegally searched Addington’s home and that disturbing photos of the dead baby emotionally impacted jurors and hurt his client’s chances for a fair trial.

When Lueras denied the motion and moved on to sentencing, Ortiz continued to stand by Addington.

'Ms. Addington is the good person that her family have described,' he said.

'I don’t think it is possible we’ll know specifically what happened on that day, but Ms. Addington didn’t do anything to harm that baby.'

Lueras was not swayed.

She lamented the difficult sentence she was about to impose, then handed it down and unceremoniously ended the hearing.

A bailiff cleared the courtroom as Addington sat there still.
