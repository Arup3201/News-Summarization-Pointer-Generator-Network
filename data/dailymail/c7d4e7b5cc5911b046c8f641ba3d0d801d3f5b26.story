A postman has won his legal battle with Royal Mail after he fell and hurt his shoulder because his boots were too slippery.

Clive Davey, 47, of Ipswich, Suffolk, is one of 15 postmen across the country who took legal action against their employer after being issued with the new footwear in 2007.

He was given £2,228 after he slipped and fell on a manhole cover 45 minutes after he put on the boots for the first time.

Payout: Clive Davey, 47, won compensation from Royal Mail after he fell because of faulty boots he was given

'My shoes and boots are the most important
piece of equipment a mailman has,' he said.

'I don't think it is too much to ask that they are well made and safe to wear.'

Hampshire postman Patrick Bitton was the first to take Royal Mail to court after he slipped and fracture his ankle while wearing the Magnum Boots.

After a four-day trial last summer, a judge at Winchester Crown Court ruled in his favour and he was awarded £3,600.

Royal Mail then decided to settle the remaining 14 cases, including Mr Davey's, outside court.

Mr Davey said: 'For the first three years I worked for Royal Mail I was happy with the equipment but then they decided to introduce the Magnum Boots.

'Almost straight away I heard how colleagues were having problems with them so I refused to wear them.

'But my manager insisted and so I gave in.'

Mr Davey, who still delivers in Stowmarket, said he had previously had surgery on his shoulder and is now considered partially disabled after the fall aggravated the injury.

Helen Stanton, of law firm Simpson Millar, which handled the cases, said: 'Despite the fact that Royal Mail's own independent assessments showed that the footwear was dangerous, the company still denied liability and dragged these cases out for years.

'Only after a judge decided in the favour or its employees did Royal Mail agree to settle the remaining 14 cases.

'It is a positive outcome but the company could have saved itself a lot of time and money, not to mention the goodwill of its staff had it acknowledged its responsibility sooner.'

A Royal Mail spokesman said: 'The safety of our employees is a top priority for Royal Mail.

'A range of boots and shoes are available for our people and these are regularly updated based on the latest designs available.

'As a result, the boots that were available five years ago are no longer used by our postmen and women.'
