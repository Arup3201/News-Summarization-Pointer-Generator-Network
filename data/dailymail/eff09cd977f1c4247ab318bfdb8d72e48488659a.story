David Cameron will attend the Girl Summit in London today and announce measures to tackle FGM

Parents who fail to prevent their daughter being subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) will face prosecution under new legislation to be unveiled by the Government at a summit in London today.

Prime Minister David Cameron is to announce a raft of measures to combat the issue at the Girl Summit, including a £1.4 million FGM Prevention Programme for survivors and those at risk of the practice and lifelong anonymity for victims.

Mr Cameron said of the issue: 'All girls have the right to live free from violence and coercion, without being forced into marriage or the lifelong physical and psychological effects of female genital mutilation.

'Abhorrent practices like these, no matter how deeply rooted in societies, violate the rights of girls and women across the world, including here in the UK.

'I want to build a better future for all our girls and I am hosting the Girl Summit today so that we say with one voice - let's end these practices once and for all.'

The measures to combat FGM and forced marriage in the UK and abroad come as Unicef warns advances made in tackling them in the developing world could be reversed if the pace of action is not increased.

Earlier this month MPs warned that the failure to tackle the growing practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) in the UK is a 'national scandal' that has resulted in the preventable abuse of thousands of girls, a committee of MPs has said.

In a hard-hitting report, the Commons Home Affairs Committee said FGM may be one of the most prevalent forms of 'severe physical child abuse' taking place in Britain, with an estimated 65,000 girls under the age of 13 at risk.

There are an estimated 170,000 women and girls in the UK who have undergone FGM, the report said, while in two London boroughs almost one in 10 girls are born to mothers who have suffered the procedure and are therefore themselves at risk.

Mr Cameron will attend the summit in London along with International Development Secretary Justine Greening, Home Secretary Theresa May and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

Mr Clegg revealed yesterday that the Government will unveil plans to give teachers, doctors and social workers extra training to identify and help girls who might be at risk of becoming victims of FGM.

Further measures to be unveiled today include:

:: New police guidance from the College of Policing and an inspection programme by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) that will look at how police handle FGM cases

:: A consultation on proposed civil court orders to protect girls at risk of FGM;

:: New legislation to grant victims of FGM lifelong anonymity from the time they make an allegation

:: A specialist 'FGM service' that will include social workers to 'proactively' identify instances of FGM

:: New programmes to prevent child and forced marriage in 12 developing nations:

:: An 'International Charter' calling for the eradication of these practices within a generation.

Unicef warned ahead of the summit that while the rate of FGM and child marriage has fallen over the past three decades, population increase in developing nations alone could reverse this trend if 'intensive action' is not introduced.

Unicef director Anthony Lake says action must be taken if the problem is not to get worse

It said its research showed that more than 130 million girls and women have experienced some form of FGM in the 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East where it is most common.

In addition some 700 million women alive today worldwide were married as children, including more than a third - 250 million - who were married before the age of 15.

Unicef executive director Anthony Lake said: 'The numbers tell us we must accelerate our efforts.

'And let's not forget that these numbers represent real lives.

'While these are problems of a global scale, the solutions must be local, driven by communities, families and girls themselves to change mindsets and break the cycles that perpetuate FGM/C and child marriage.

'We can't let the staggering numbers numb us - they must compel us to act.'
