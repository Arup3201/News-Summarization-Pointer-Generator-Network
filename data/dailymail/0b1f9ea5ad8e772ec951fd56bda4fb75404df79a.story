Louis van Gaal has thanked Manchester United's hierarchy for their continued investment in his squad rather than dishing him out a dressing down for the club's poor start to the season.

Van Gaal is yet to taste victory in the United hotseat with two defeats and two draws from his opening four games in charge.

The Red Devils are currently 14th in the Premier League with two points after three matches, but the Dutchman's low point in his early tenure at Old Trafford came in a humiliating 4-0 thrashing at League One side MK Dons in the Capital One Cup second round.

Despite the alarming start, United's board have backed the 63-year-old by spending over £150million this summer - with Daley Blind and Radamel Falcao both arriving on transfer deadline day.

The spending spree at Old Trafford has come as a welcome surprise to Van Gaal who recieved a heavy rollicking for a similar poor start whilst in charge of Bayern Munich by general manager Uli Hoeness.

All smiles: Daley Blind joined United in a £14million move from Ajax on transfer deadline day

'My start at Bayern Munich was just as bad as my start with Manchester United. But the big differenre was that at Bayern I had already been called in for a major showdown with director Uli Hoeness, who wanted an explanation,' he told the Daily Mirror.

'And what have United done? They have just bought more players for me. They kept buying players. They are supporting me.

'That is a sign of trust in the manager. I feel their trust and belief in my ability. It is not just a matter of believing in my football philosophy, but in me as a person too.'
