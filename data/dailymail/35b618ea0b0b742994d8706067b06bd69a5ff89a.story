British destroyer HMS Daring has docked in the Philippines and is preparing to distribute aid to areas not yet reached by humanitarian workers.

The ship's Lynx helicopter has spent three days surveying Panay and other islands near Cebu, where Daring has docked.

It will now be used to take 500 shelter kits and 10 tonnes of high energy biscuits to isolated areas, while the ship will use its water filters to fill 1,900 water carriers with clean drinking water.

David Cameron praised the UK for taking the lead in international aid efforts as donations to the disaster appeal topped £33million and the government pledged another £30million of funding

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'HMS Daring's arrival is a major boost to the Department for International Development's (DFID) disaster experts and medical teams already deployed in the Philippines.

'This Royal Navy vessel will help us open a lifeline and allow us to help many more victims of the disaster.'

A DFID flight is also due to depart East Midlands Airport later today, loaded with more than 95 tonnes of aid including water and sanitation equipment along with vital supplies on behalf of Save the Children and Oxfam.

'More British help is on its way,' Ms Greening added.

'The British people have shown huge generosity over the past days and DFID is working with charities to make sure all their donations get to those who need it most.'

The news comes after donations to the UK disaster appeal topped £33million and David Cameron praised the country for 'taking the lead' in international aid efforts, while also pledging £30million more in Government funding, bring the total to £50million.

The Chinese government says it is ready to send rescue and medical teams to the neighbouring Philippines, more than a week after Typhoon Haiyan struck.

In a press release from the Foreign Ministry, the country said teams would depart 'if weather permitted' while the communist nation pledged just £1.2million ($2m) in aid.

The sum, more than forty times smaller than the UK's pledge of £50million, is seen by some as the result of a dispute over the South China Sea islands.

The collection of 250 islands, most of which are under water at high tide, have long been claimed by both countries.

There was no immediate indication whether the aid teams were preparing to depart or whether the Philippine government had accepted the Chinese offer.

Views expressed on the Chinese internet have argued strongly against aiding the Philippines, despite the potential damage to Beijing's hopes of being regarded as a responsible regional leader.

Speaking on behalf of the 14 UK charities which make up the Disasters Emergency Committee, chief executive Saleh Saeed said: 'The generosity of the public is yet again surpassing all expectations.'

It is now eight days since Typhoon Haiyan - the strongest storm ever to make landfall - struck, and virtually wiped the city of Tacloban off the map.

HMS Daring, a Type 45 destroyer, will join a 12-strong team of British doctors, surgeons and paramedics are already in the crisis zone, helping to treat survivors of the disaster.

David Cameron said an estimated 3,600 people have been killed in the tragedy, while another 12million have been affected.

Two JCB diggers, two Land Rovers and a forklift truck were also delivered to Cebu airport yesterday by an RAF C-17 aircraft.

Asif Ahmad, British ambassador to the Philippines, was at the airport to meet yesterday morning's delivery.

He said: 'The significance of this load is that it is heavy machinery: bulldozers, Land Rovers, machines that can actually push through the debris that is blocking aid now.

'This is vital equipment because the Philippine military and others have not been able to bring this material here.'

This afternoon a Save the Children barge carrying 25 tonnes of aid is also due to arrive in the region.

Meanwhile China has drawn criticism after pledging just $2million (£1.2m) in aid.

The Chinese government also announced today that it is ready to send aid workers to the neighbouring country, more than a week after the disaster unfolded.

The lackluster response is blamed by 
some on a dispute over the South China Sea islands, which have long been
claimed by both nations.

A number of Britons are missing following Typhoon Haiyan, Foreign Secretary William Hague confirmed yesterday.

Among
those feared dead is Colin Bembridge, 61, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, 
who was staying with his Filipino partner Maybelle, 35, and their 
three-year-old daughter Victoria near the city of Tacloban when the 
storm struck.

Channel 4 
News said Mr Bembridge was visiting his girlfriend's relatives and had 
hired a beach house in Baybay, one of the ravaged coastal villages.

The
mother of Mr Bembridge's partner, 79-year-old Lydia, showed the 
programme the wreckage of the beach house where her daughter and 
granddaughter were staying, and said they had not been seen since the 
typhoon struck eight days ago.

A Foreign Office spokesman said Mr Hague spoke on the phone to Philippines secretary for foreign affairs Albert Ferreros Del Rosario to offer his condolences.

'The Foreign Secretary confirmed that a number of British nationals remained unaccounted for,' the spokesman added. 'He asked that every possible assistance be given to any British people caught up in the disaster.'

Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious is being sent to replace HMS Daring, which had just begun an exercise in the South China Sea when it was tasked to join the humanitarian relief effort.

The latest death toll given by Mr Cameron is an increase of more than 1,000 on estimates made by the country's civil defence agency earlier this week.

But some officials estimate that the final toll, when the missing are declared dead and remote regions are reached, will be more than 10,000.
