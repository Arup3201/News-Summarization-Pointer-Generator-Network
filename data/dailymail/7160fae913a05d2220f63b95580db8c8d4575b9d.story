Preacher of hate Abu Hamza yesterday told a court yesterday he had just been a spokesman for Yemeni a terrorist group that ended up killing three Britons ‘like Gerry Adams with the IRA’.

Hamza said he had no advanced knowledge of the kidnapping of 16 tourists in December 1998 - which ended in a bloodbath when three Britons and an Australian were killed in a firefight.

Hamza admitted the prosecution claim that he bought the kidnappers a satellite phone and topped it up with £500 credit.

But he claimed his motives were dramatically different from those which have been alleged -  because he wanted a peaceful conclusion.

Hamza, who at the time was running the Finsbury Park mosque in North London said: ‘To be clear, I was acting like Gerry Adams with the IRA.

‘We couldn’t afford to do anything other than (be) legal and transparent’.

The court was shown phone records from December 27 1998, the day before the kidnapping, which revealed that Hamza’s home landline was called three times by the satellite phone.

The following day the tourists were ambushed as they drove through the desert in Yemen by members of the fanatical Islamic Army of Aden.

Hamza said that he only found out after the fact because he was called by an associate in the UK  - and felt that a ‘can of worms’ had been opened.

He told the jury how he thought the terrorists had shown ‘ignorance’ by moving without consulting him.

Five hours after the hostage taking - as the tourists were being used as human shields amid a furious gun battle - Hamza spoke to the ringleader Abu Hasan on the satellite phone.

He said: ‘I didn’t argue with him. I said to him I was a bit angry. He said don’t panic, these things happen in Yemen every day. I said this is different’.

Hasan told him he wanted to be a martyr but Hamza told him that ‘this is not the platform’ to do so.

Hamza issued a press release and gave a press conference at Conway Hall in London to try and put pressure on the Yemeni government not to attempt a rescue.

But his efforts were unsuccessful and carnage ensued when the Yemeni army advanced.

The terrorists who he had been talking to forced all 16 captives to stand on mounds and fired through their legs during the terrifying ordeal, the court has been told.

Hamza, 56, who only has one eye and has stumps for hands, is also accused of trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon and trying to facilitate jihad in Afghanistan.

He denies all the charges and the trial at Manhattan’s Federal Court, which is in its fifth week, continues.
