Nick Clegg’s flagship plan to extend free school meals to all five, six and seven-year-olds is today condemned as impractical and unfair.

Many primary school heads are warning they do not have the space or kitchen facilities to contend with the change for an extra 1.5 million children, which is due to take effect next September.

Some heads and governors still believe that it will be impractical for many schools to provide a hot meal by September 2014, and they may have to offer a packed lunch instead.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's plan to extend the free school meals programme to all five, six and seven-year-olds, regardless of how much their parents earn, has come under fire from primary school headteachers who say it is 'impractical and unfair'

A former Liberal Democrat minister, meanwhile, said it was ‘very odd’ to be extending free school meals for all families with young children, even those who could well afford to pay for them themselves.

Despite Britain’s vast budget deficit, Mr Clegg has announced that from next September, an extra 1.5 million infants in reception and years one and two will qualify regardless of their parents’ income.

The measure will save even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child. The £600 million a year cost of the scheme is to be met through spending cuts elsewhere and moves to clamp down on tax avoidance.

However, critics have questioned the coherence of offering free school meals for all families with young children, while taking the axe to other universal payments such as child benefit for the better-off.

Currently, free school meals are limited to the 400,000 poorest families, and many of those who are entitled do not claim because of the stigma attached to doing so.

Extending them to all under-sevens in state education is designed to show the coalition is taking further steps to help families with the cost of living.

The £600million plan is part of a deal with the Tories that meant them agreeing to a similar sum being spent on a £200 tax break for married couples.

Last week, the Government rushed out an announcement of an extra £150 million to fund new kitchens and dining halls, but many schools still warn of logistical difficulties in getting the policy in place for September 2014.

Sean O’Sullivan, head at Frank Wise special school in Banbury, Oxfordshire, who invested in a new server 18 months ago, said: ‘We have built a special kitchen that’s got warming and refrigeration but not actually the facility to cook.

‘I’m fearful this could push things to the lowest common denominator. Our suppliers simply can’t manage the quality that they do at the moment for high numbers.’

‘These kind of things get announced at a political conference and, as a head, you’re absolutely bombarded. With the amount of stuff that comes through to you, you have to prioritise.’

Michael Dix, headteacher at Glebelands primary school in Leicester, said: ‘The school was built in the 1990s at a time when space cost money, so we don’t have any.

'The hall is not only used for dinner times - it is our only internal PE space.

'We will probably have to stagger our lunchtimes to allow for the additional serving-up time that will be inevitable if numbers rise. This would mean a reduction in the amount of PE we are able to provide.’

Former Lib Dem minister Sir Nick Harvey said last night: ‘This is not something that can be done on the back of a fag packet. In rural areas a lot of small primary schools don’t have big halls where you can sit the whole school down.

‘And tragically in recent years many schools have got rid of kitchens and devoted the space to other uses altogether.

‘There are 1.2 million children defined by the Government itself as living in childhood poverty who don’t get a free school meal. 200,000 of those will get one as a result of this, but the other million will not, because they are older.

‘It’s very odd to be providing a free school meal to 1.3 million children whose parents can perfectly well afford it and not paying out to one million whose parents can’t. It seems to me an odd sense of priorities.’

The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) warned many schools ‘absolutely can’t think how they are going to do this’.

The organisation predicted that the Government would have to U-turn on an initial commitment to providing a ‘hot, nutritious meal’ for all children. The commitment has already been refined to a pledge to ‘ensure children get a healthy meal in the middle of the day’.

Headteachers and governors still believe that it will be impractical for many schools to provide a hot meal by September 2014, and they may have to offer a packed lunch instead.

‘We have pointed out the key challenges for schools, particularly if they’re going to insist on a hot school meal. There is lots more flexibility if it’s a packed lunch to the nutritional standards,’ said Valentine Mulholland, of the NAHT.

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We know that regularly eating a nutritious school meal can help to increase a child’s educational attainment.

‘Free school meals for all infant school pupils will save parents an average of £400 a year, and make sure every child can get the healthy lunch that will help them do well at school.’

A spokesman for Mr Clegg insisted: ‘The expectation is for the majority of meals to be hot.’
