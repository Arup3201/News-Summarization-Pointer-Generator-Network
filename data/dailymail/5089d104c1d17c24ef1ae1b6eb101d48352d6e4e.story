Zlatan Ibrahimovic has blamed old boss Pep Guardiola for failing to win the Champions League at Barcelona in 2010.

The 32-year-old Paris Saint-Germain striker will miss Tuesday's European clash with his old club due to a heel injury.

And Ibrahimovic reflected on a missed opportunity to win the competition four years ago when Barcelona were knocked out of the semi-finals by Inter Milan.

The Swedish striker was replaced after 63 minutes of the second leg at the Nou Camp - and it clearly still rankles.

Ibrahimovic told Canal+: 'We had the best team in the world but we failed to win the Champions League because of bad decisions from someone.

'But it’s like that. It’s nothing to complain about today. You have to forget it because I had great moments at Barcelona.'
