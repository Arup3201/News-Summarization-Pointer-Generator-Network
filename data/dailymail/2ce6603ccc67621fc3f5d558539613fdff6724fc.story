A Chinese holidaymaker has been hit with a fine for washing her feet in a public bathroom on one of Thailand’s picturesque tourist islands.

The woman was spotted washing her feet in a sink less than 30 minutes after island officials posted a ‘no foot washing’ sign in the loo.

The warnings were posted in bathrooms on the island of Phi Phi Don a few days after a group of Chinese tourists upset locals by washing their feet and sandals in hand basins.

Koh Phi Phi-Nopparathara National Park Chief Chaithat Boonphupantanti told the Phuket Gazette: ‘She didn’t pay any attention to the sign directly in front of her.

‘Our officers took photos of her breaking the law before informing her that she was committing a crime.’

She was fined 1,000 baht (£20 or $30) and her tour guide was informed of the incident, meaning she could face further discipline back home.

Mr Boonphupantanti told the newspaper: ‘The sign is in English with clear pictures of what is prohibited. We will be looking to include Chinese-language warnings as well.

‘We were not rude or aggressive when we were dealing with the tourist. We are just trying to establish rules that will keep the place clean and beautiful.’

The relationship between Chinese tourists and Thai locals has become strained following a series of high-profile incidents that have led to stern warnings from the Chinese government and an etiquette guide being published by Thailand’s tourist board.

Earlier this week, photos that showed Chinese visitors washing their feet and sandals in public sinks in Phi Phi led to outrage, with locals insisting that the holidaymakers committed a cultural faux pas.

The signs went up in public bathrooms after a group of visitors washed their feet in sinks earlier this week 

An island official told NetEase, a Chinese media agency, that the holidaymakers’ actions were ‘inappropriate’ and that notices would be posted in public bathrooms to discourage the behaviour.

Thailand is a popular destination for about four million Chinese tourists every year, but locals have expressed frustration and outrage in response to the actions of a handful of visitors.

Last month, Thailand’s tourist board announced that it would be handing out etiquette manuals to Chinese tourists who were visiting during the Chinese New Year.

The manuals outlined how the holidaymakers are expected to behave while they visit Thailand.

They were created after the Thai government received complaints from locals, who accused Chinese visitors of defecating in public, causing traffic accidents with reckless driving, and defacing tourist attractions.

Chinese tourists were temporarily banned from even entering Wat Rong Khun, the Buddhist White Temple in Chiang Rai, after complaints that they had ruined the toilets.
