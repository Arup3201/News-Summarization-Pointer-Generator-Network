Killer: Michael Adebolajo, 29, has launched an appeal against his whole life prison sentence, the Judicial Office has confirmed

One of soldier Lee Rigby's murderers has launched an appeal against his whole life prison sentence, the Judicial Office has confirmed.

Michael Adebolajo, 29, together with Michael Adebowale, 22, mowed down Fusilier Rigby in car, before hacking him to death in Woolwich, south east London, in May last year.

Adebolajo was condemned to die behind bars - with judge Mr Justice Sweeney saying the killer had 'no real prospect of rehabilitation'.

However, Adebowale was sentenced to a minimum of 45 years in jail because of his younger age, mental health problems and 'lesser role' in the 25-year-old father-of-one's murder.

Now, Adebolajo has launched an appeal against his whole life prison term - just weeks after his sibling claimed that the sentence was Islamophobic.

The British-born extremists were sentenced at the Old Bailey in February for butchering Fusilier Rigby in broad daylight near Woolwich Barracks on May 22.

At the time, the pair both claimed that they were ‘soldiers of Allah’ and were motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing.

During their sentencing, violence broke out in the Old Bailey dock and the killers began hurling abuse at the judge and fighting with prison guards.

In extraordinary scenes, the two Muslim extremists yelled 'Allahu Akbar' and 'You (Britain) and America will never be safe' during their sentencing at the court in Central London.

When sentencing Adebolajo and Adebowale, Mr Justice Sweeney told them: 'You each converted to 
Islam some years ago.

'Thereafter you were radicalised and each became an
 extremist, espousing a cause and views which, as has been said 
elsewhere, are a betrayal of Islam and of the peaceful Muslim 
communities who give so much to our country.

'You decided between you, and in order to advance your 
extremist cause, to murder a soldier in public in broad daylight and to 
do so in a way that would generate maximum media coverage, including 
getting yourselves killed by armed officers who would be bound to attend
 the scene in the aftermath of the murder - thereby expecting that you 
would become martyrs and each gain a place in paradise.'

Following the sentencing of Adebolajo, who has two children and four stepchildren, Fusilier Rigby's heartbroken relatives said 'justice has been served'.

Shocking: A blood-drenched Adebolajo said he was a 'soldier of Allah' and was motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing

Adebolajo and Adebowale chose the young soldier as their victim because he was wearing a Help for Heroes hooded top.

They mowed him down in a car, before hacking at his limp body with a meat cleaver and knives in an attempt to decapitate him.

Mr Justice Sweeney said he had chosen to give Adebolajo a whole life prison term because he was the leader of the murderous plot and had no hope of rehabilitation.

However, in March, Adebolajo's brother, Jeremiah Adebolajo, said his sibling should not be forced to die behind bars - claiming that the judge had caved in to 'pressure' and 'gave the public what they wanted'. 

He added that his brother would 'pose no danger to the public' if realeased, and would 'lead a very productive life'.

Whole-life terms have come under the spotlight recently after leading judges at the Court of Appeal ruled that murderers who commit the most 'heinous' of crimes can be sent to prison for the rest of their lives.

A specially-constituted court declared that sentencing judges can continue to impose 'whole-life' tariffs in such cases.

Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said the court had held that the statutory scheme enacted by Parliament, enabling judges to pass whole-life orders, was 'entirely compatible' with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

Sentencing in a number of high-profile criminal cases had been put on hold - including the terms to be handed out to Fusilier Rigby’s murderers - pending the Court of Appeal’s ruling, which was given in February.

The ruling followed a successful appeal to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) by murderers Jeremy Bamber, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore.

Fight: During Adebolajo and Adebowale's sentencing, violence broke out in the Old Bailey dock and the killers began hurling abuse at the judge and fighting with prison guards. Above, a sketch of the pair in court

Last July, the ECHR held that there had been a violation of Article 3 of the European on Human Rights - which relates to inhuman and degrading treatment - on the basis that whole-life orders were not 'reducible'.

The Strasbourg-based court did not say that whole-life sentences were incompatible with the Convention, but that there had to be the possibility of a review at some stage and that current laws allowing for release in exceptional circumstances were unclear.

Ruling: Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said the statutory scheme enabling judges to pass whole-life orders was 'entirely compatible' with the European Convention on Human Rights

But the Court of Appeal judges ruled that the Grand Chamber was wrong when it reached a conclusion that the law of England and Wales did not clearly provide for 'reducibility', saying that the domestic law 'is clear as to "possible exceptional release of whole-life prisoners".'

A power of review arose if there were 'exceptional circumstances'. An offender was required to demonstrate to the Secretary of State that, although a whole-life order was just punishment at the time the order was made, exceptional circumstances had arisen since.

The Secretary of State 'must then consider whether such exceptional circumstances justify the release on compassionate grounds', the judges said.

Lord Thomas concluded: 'In our judgment, the law of England and Wales therefore does provide to an offender ‘hope’ or the ‘possibility’ of release in exceptional circumstances which render the just punishment originally imposed no longer justifiable.'

On whole-life orders in general, Lord Thomas said the Court of Appeal did not read the Grand Chamber’s judgment 'as in any way casting doubt on the fact that there are crimes that are so heinous that just punishment may require imprisonment for life'.

Those currently serving whole-life terms in England and Wales include Moors Murderer Ian Brady, who tortured and murdered children along with accomplice Myra Hindley, and serial killer Rosemary West.
