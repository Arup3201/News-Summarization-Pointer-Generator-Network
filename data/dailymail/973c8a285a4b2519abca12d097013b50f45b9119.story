The stunning contestants of this year's Miss Universe competition showcased their country in an unusually spectacular fashion- the National Costume segment, where entrants, including our own Miss Australia, wore a series of elaborate costumes to display the unique flavour of their homeland.

Australia's entrant into the 63rd annual competition, held at Florida International University in Miami, was 22-year-old Tegan Martin, who wore an outfit inspired by the Aboriginal Dreamtime sunset.

Featuring a large multi-coloured semi-circle backdrop to be worn on her back like Victoria's Secret Angel wings, the outfit also included a beaded skirt and strapless crop top in a scorched red earth colour.

It was chosen from among a range of options, including one outfit inspired by the Sydney Opera House and another inspired by Steve Irwin.

Earlier in the day, she sauntered down the runway for the Swimsuit Competition of the Preliminary Miss Universe Show. 

Tegan, a model and former hairdresser, is currently studying a Bachelor of Nutritional Medicine, and said that she has hopes of raising awareness of youth mental health issues.

She is also part of a youth mentoring program helping schoolgirls struggling with confidence. 

The Newcastle-born beauty posted a video several days earlier of herself struggling to assemble the elaborate rainbow feature of her costume.

The brief Instagram clip sees the puzzled blonde entangled in poles and wires, exclaiming: 'I may be up all night building a tent here'.

Tegan, who once worked as a model in Paris, came second in the Miss Universe Australia competition twice before she won on her third and final attempt.

The Miss Universe finals will then be held at the FIU Arena on Sunday 25 January, when Venezuelan Miss Universe 2013, Gabriela Isler, will hand over her crown.

Other contestants brought their nationality's unique flavour to the competition, wearing an elaborate range of costumes spanning from the Buckingham Palace Queen's Guard to the national tree of Venezuela. 

But while there was no doubt that all of the contestants had gone to extreme lengths to stand out from the crowd, some of the outfits left the audience rather confused as to the link to the woman in question's home country. 

One lady wore flags from across the entire world, not her own nation, while another appeared to be wearing just a simple ball gown. 

One contestant that left viewers in no doubt though, was Miss Canada, who came dressed as an ice hockey player, complete with working scoreboard.  

Miss Great Britain: Grace Levy wore a skimpy version of uniform worn by the Queen's Guard when they are on duty outside Buckingham Palace. She accessorised with a gold choker that bore an imitation of the Royal Insignia 

Miss USA: Nia Sanchez came dressed in an elaborate version of the stars and stripes on the American flag. The metre-long white feathers were all hand-stitched onto the silk corset 

Miss India: Noyonita Lodh's outfit looked like it could be dangerous if you got too close 

Miss France: Camille Cerf wore a chic beret to match a red ribbon tied around the waist of her lace gown 

Miss Sri Lanka: Marianne Page, who made her national costume herself. The outfit features intricate beading, jewels and several metres of mirrored material  

Miss Canada: Chanel Beckenlehner came dressed as a glamorous ice hockey player, complete with working scoreboard and ice hockey stick. Her hairstyle was a copycat of the country's hockey tournament trophy, The Stanley Cup. Ice hockey is the official national winter sport of Canada

Miss Ireland: Lisa Madden wore medieval-looking costume of armour in shades of red. The look was inspired by Celtic warriors 

Miss Venezuela: Migbelis Lynette Castellanos came as a glittering version of the Tabebuia chrysantha. It is the national tree of Venezuela as it is native to the country and it's deep yellow resembles the one on the Venezuelan flag 

Miss Dominican Republic: Kimberly Castillo. Her costume depicts the Virgen de Altagraci - the Virgin is the patron saint of the Dominican Republic

Miss Portugal: Patricia Da Silva who came dressed in a costume depicting two birds. The Rooster of Barcelos is the fictional national bird of Portugal 

Miss Lebanon: Saly Greige. Saly wore the simplest item of clothing for the evening -  a billowing long sherwal, which is the most common and practical garment in rural areas of the country - although covered in this picture, the dress actually features trousers with a low crotch

Miss Russia: Yulia Alipova wore a dress inspired by the Byzantine era and its influence to the Russian culture. The ornate headress was embedded with brocade and emerald and ruby-like stones

Miss Korea: Yoo Yebin wore a Hanbok, which is the south Korean national dress. She also wore a outer layer that featured flags from all over the world as a symbol of unity 

Miss Japan: Keiko Tsuji came dress as a Sōjutsu fighter. Sōjutsu meanins "art of the spear" and is the Japanese martial art of fighting with a yari (a Japanese spear) 

Miss Ecuador: Alejandra Argudom wore one of the most revealing outfits of the evening. The costume featured several materials indigenous to Ecuador including the Tagua nut, also know as vegetable ivory, which comes from the rain forests of Ecuador

Miss Lithuania: Patricija Belousova had the most daring costume of the evening - her sheer dress revealed every inch of her body 

Miss Jamaica: Kaci Fennell came dressed as in carnival gear - which is one of the key moments in the Jamaican calendar 

Miss Spain: Desire Cordero Ferrer wore a medieval-style gown for her national costume

Miss Switzerland: Zoe Metthez wore a simple gown that featured the country's flag on her train 

Miss Kosovo: Artnesa Krasniqi's version of Kosovan national dress would most likely make many of her fellow countrymen blush 

Miss Slovenia: Urska Bracko's outfit was one of the least outlandish

Miss St. Lucia: Roxanne Didler-Nicholas shone in her modernised version of St Lucian national dress 

Miss South Africa: Ziphozakhe Zokufa wore a dress featuring the colours of the South African flag
