Failure has become a formality for London Welsh and relegation became a reality after they suffered their 18th consecutive Aviva Premiership defeat in a dire meeting with Bath.

This was more ‘Sloppy Sunday’ than ‘Super Saturday’ as torrential weather conditions dictated an arm wrestle that confirmed the end of the Exiles’ short-lived spell back in the top flight.

For Welsh coach Rowland Phillips, on his first game in charge since taking over from Justin Burnell, it spelt the beginning of a long and painful rebuilding process to get the Oxford-based franchise back to where they want to be. ‘We have to learn our lessons,’ said Phillips. ‘There is honest ambition throughout the club and the mindset has to be about improving. We will have one eye on next season.

‘People could say “that’s it” and wind down for the rest of the season but we’re too proud to switch off and wait for the summer holidays.’

The Exiles have a 653-point deficit going into the final four games of the season but this was one of their narrower defeats against a Bath side that will need to improve exponentially if they are going to challenge Leinster in this Saturday’s Champions Cup quarter-final.

‘The conditions were terrible,’ said Bath director of rugby Mike Ford. ‘We’ll put that game in the bin and next week will be a different spectacle.’

Running into torrential wind and rain in the first half, Bath scored twice inside 23 minutes through Rob Webber and Leroy Houston.

The visitors had rested their England quartet — George Ford, Jonathan Joseph, Anthony Watson and Dave Attwood — and their qualities were missed as Welsh edged back through Nic Reyonlds. They were urged on by a meagre home crowd but hopes of a comeback were dented when Nathan Trevett was sin-binned.

With the biblical conditions subsiding, Bath extended their lead when Sam Burgess — who Ford revealed will be involved on Saturday — broke through two defenders. The floodgates soon opened.

Houston forced his way over off the back of a scrum and, three minutes later, Alafoti Faosiliva darted through after Carl Fearns intercepted a loose pass.

The Exiles’ giant No 8 Opeti Fonua, bound for Leicester next season, crashed over for a late try but the damage was long done.
