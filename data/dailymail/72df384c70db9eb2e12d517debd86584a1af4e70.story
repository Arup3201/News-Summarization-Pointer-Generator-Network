Gone are the days of flight attendants in miniskirts, but sexism in still alive and well in the the airline industry - as evidenced by a note a passenger left to his female pilot on a flight this weekend in Canada. 

WestJet Airlines pilot Carey Steacy had just wrapped up a flight from Victoria to Calgary when cleaning crews brought her a note, written on a napkin, left behind by one of the passengers.

The note, written by a 'David' and left at seat 12 E, tells Steacy that 'the cockpit of an airliner is no place for a woman.

A woman's place: A passenger named 'David' left behind this sexist note aimed at female WestJet Airlines pilot Carey Steacy after a flight this weekend in Canada

Sexist: In the note, David said that a woman's greatest honor is being a mother and that they are short moms and not pilots

'A woman being a mother is the most honor, not as "captain". We're short mothers, not pilots WestJet,' the note continues.

'PS I wish WestJet could tell me a fair lady is at the helm so I could book another flight! In the end this is all mere vanity. Not impressed.'

The note is signed 'Respectfully in love, David'.

Steacy, a mother of two, told CTV News that she is used to passengers being surprised that they have a female captain, but she has never been the target of such blatant sexism.

Her male co-pilot and the female flight attendants were equally shocked by the message.

'We didn't know what to say,' she said.

Not OK: Mother of two, and a pilot for 17 years, Steacy shot back at the sexist passenger by posting pictures of the note on her Facebook

But eventually Steacy decided to make a stand, and posted the pictures of the note on Facebook to make a point that what the passenger wrote was not OK.

'I have heard many comments from people throughout my 17-year career as a pilot. Most of them positive. Your note is, without a doubt, the funniest. It was a joke, right? RIGHT?? I thought, not.

'You were more than welcome to deplane when you heard I was a "fair lady". You have that right. Funny, we all, us humans, have the same rights in this great free country of ours.'

The airline also issued a statement, saying: 'We are enormously proud of the professionalism, skills and expertise of our pilots and we were disappointed to see this note.'

Biggest hope: Steacy says she hopes the incident will inspire more women to enroll in flight schools to become pilots

Spokesman Robert Palmer wouldn't speak further, saying 'to do so only serves to lend credibility to the note, which it doesn't deserve.'

Since posting the pictures on Facebook, Steacy says she's received an overwhelming amount of supportive comments.

'I have to think that’s very much an uncommon opinion among the general public,' she said.

She hopes some good will come of the incident, and inspire more women to enroll in flight schools to become pilots themselves.

'I just hope that that mindset can change, like it has in a lot of professions,' she said.
