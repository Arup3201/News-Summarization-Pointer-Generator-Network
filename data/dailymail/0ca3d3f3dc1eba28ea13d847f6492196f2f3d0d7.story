Sun-worshippers headed for the coast today as another glorious glow of sunshine saw temperatures in parts of Britain hitting 82f (28c).

There were packed scenes on Fistral beach in Newquay, Cornwall, as thousands attended the Relentless Boardmasters Music and Surf festival.

And in
Bournemouth, crowds flocked to the beach as car parks 
overflowed and roads were jam-packed, with an estimated 60,000 people 
heading to the seven-mile stretch of sand to soak up some rays.

There were 15 minute queues at the seafront booths as sweltering visitors rushed to purchase ice creams and cold soft drinks.

Seaside traders who just a few 
weeks ago were fearing meltdown when the storms saw cold, rainswept 
beaches deserted are counting their blessings - and their jingling tills
- with the hot weather coming on top of the feelgood factor inspired by
Team GB’s amazing gold successes at the Games.

'It’s
lifted everyone’s spirits and people are walking round with smiles on 
their faces and enjoying all this beautiful weather' said one deck chair
attendant at Bournemouth, where he rushed to cope as the sands 
started filling with families well before nine o’ clock this morning.

Sales of buckets and spades shot up and one trader completely sold out of inflatable dinghies and rubber rings.

Some restaurants along the strip were forced to turn customers away as people waited an hour for a table.

Kerry said: 'It's just fantastic here today, it's like we're abroad.

'The
kids are having a whale of a time and really enjoying themselves, we've
built sandcastles, dug holes, and are about to go for a paddle.

'It's a great opportunity for the children to have fun outside and burn off some steam.

Forecasters are predicting another warm weekend, although it won't go without an appearance from the rain.

Showers
are expected to cover the south-east on Sunday afternoon, affecting the
last day of the Olympics.

Thursday was the hottest day of the Games so
far, with spectators and athletes in London expected to enjoy 27c
sunshine tomorrow as the final medals are decided.

Tony Wardle, forecaster at the Met Office said: 'Tomorrow also looks fine but 
unfortunately it doesn't look to last as over the next couple of days we
could see showers brought in from the west.'

Dahlia failure: Gardener mourns lack of prized blooms after a year of bad weather and there is more rain due this weekend

A pensioner's colourful garden has been left looking bare thanks to this year's erratic weather conditions and there's more topsy-turvy weather to come as temperatures set to plummet as low as 11c in some parts of Britain.

Ken Stock's dazzling displays of dahlias usually draw in crowds of tourists to his bungalow's front garden in Bournemouth, raising money for charity.

But this year's icy winter, dry spring and wet summer have ruined Mr Stock's hard work and turned his prized garden into a blooming disaster.

And it looks like the wet weather will be back as London waves goodbye to the Olympics with traditional British summer rain predicted for the final events on Sunday afternoon.

Forecasters are expecting the damp spell to clear ahead of a warm night for the closing ceremony, however.

Ken Stock usually has a garden full of beautiful bright dahlias, but this year's weather has left it bare

Mr Stock, a retired painter and decorator, 80, usually ends up with a blaze of colour in front of his home with attractive red, orange, pink, purple and white flowers.

He spent three weeks in the spring time planting his dahlia tubers, and his hard work is normally rewarded in mid-summer.

But this year’s sparse display is thought to be the worst in 15 years, thanks to the bizarre weather, meaning visitors numbers have drastically fallen. He has still managed to raise £150 for charity so far, after raising more than a thousand pounds last year.

Mr Stock said: 'I started breeding dahlias when I was about 65 and just introduced more and more into the garden.

'The plants are incredibly diverse which is why I like them so much.

'The garden is usually full of colour but I’d say this year is probably the worst in about 15, and I have only had about three visitors, usually there would be hundreds.

'I believe the weather is to blame, we had a lot of heat, followed by a lot of rain and cold, and a hosepipe ban.

'Dahlias need a typical British summer to thrive so they just haven’t done as well, and I am quite disappointed.

'I’m just hoping for an Indian summer which could mean they bloom from September right through until November if we are lucky.

'I just haven’t seen a year quite as bad as this.'
