Fans of celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal have taken to social media to express their devastation at missing out on a table at his exclusive Fat Duck restaurant which will be opened for a limited time next year at Crown Melbourne.

The England-based restaurant headed up Blumenthal is temporarily moving to Australia for six months with a menu that costs $525 per person, which feature the chef's signature dishes that infuse science with food.

The British chef is known for his kooky creations which include lickable wallpaper a la Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and bacon and egg ice cream.

Fans of celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal (pictured here outside Fat Duck in England) have taken to social media to express their devastation at missing out on a table at his exclusive Fat Duck restaurant in Melbourne

He aims to provide diners with a full sensory experience when they sit down at the table.

Last month, Australians had the chance to put their name in an online ballot to win a table at his temporary Fat Duck restaurant and on Monday the results were in.

A total of 89,179 people entered the ballot from all over the world, news.com.au reported.

Those who were not lucky enough to get a place have expressed their bitter disappointment on Twitter but not without a sense of humour.

'#fatduckmelbourne ballots are out, sadly I did not get a reservation #sadduck. Guess Ill [sic] get $500 of #maccas [McDonald's] instead,' Julian Ridden tweeted.

Julian Ridden was one of the unlucky few to have his ballot application knocked back

Meanwhile Diana Forward said she was 'so bummed' to miss out on a table

Fat Duck will cost $525 per person for a tasting menu which will take four and a half hours to finish

'Missed out in the ballot for a reservation at #fatduckmelbourne,' James Caldwell tweeted

Some who were knocked back were trying to negotiate their way onto others' tables

While Roslyn Grundy said: 'But Heston, I thought we were buddies?'

Twitter user Candice offered up a friend as payment.

'Will trade @Dame_1978 for a table at the #fatduckmelbourne - No luck in the ballot & this looks too good to miss out,' she wrote.

But della wilson was more conventional in her method of compensation.

'Willing to pay if anyone has a fat duck reservation for Melbourne #fatduckmelbourne #gutted #alreadybeentodinnerbyheston,' she said.

While David Brim will get a chance to taste the delights the exclusive restaurant has to offer

With devastation came jubilation from those who had received an acceptance email.

'Woohoo- this email made my day! Thanks #fatduckmelbourne and #crownmelbourne #reservation #heston,' Abby Mm tweeted.

And David Brim was equally happy: '@Heston_Live just got my golden ticket to the #fatduckmelbourne very excited...'.

But it appears some are stuck in limbo and did not receive a response at all.

'hmm, @crownmelbourne say I must have given wrong email to not have a response by now. Seems weird 4 of my friends same,' Herbal said.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Crown Melbourne for comment.

It is believed all emails notifying the lucky diners have now been sent.

However unsuccessful applicants who have been placed on the waiting list, only at their request, may still have a chance if there are any cancellations. 

Earlier this year, Fat Duck was named the third best restaurant in the world in an annual poll run by private jet lifestyle magazine Elite Traveler and Champagne Laurent-Perrier.

His London eatery, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal also placed 23rd in the top 100 eateries in the world list.
