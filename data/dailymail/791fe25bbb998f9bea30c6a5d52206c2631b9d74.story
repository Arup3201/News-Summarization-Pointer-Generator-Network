A schoolboy narrowly avoided death when he was impaled on a spiked fence.

Bobby Ward, 10, was climbing on spiked railings when he slipped and one of the spears went through his chin.

It missed any major arteries and was less than a centimetre away from his windpipe.

Ordeal: Bobby Ward, 10, was millimetres from death when he was impaled on a metal fence

Accident: The schoolboy was climbing on these railings near his home in Walker, Newcastle, when he fell

Speared: A spike ripped through the 10-year-old's chin, millimetres from his windpipe

As he pulled himself off the fence the spike ripped through his flesh.

The courageous youngster then ran to a relative who lived nearby, who then attempted to stop the bleeding before calling an ambulance.

The boy, of Fossway, in Walker, Newcastle, said: 'I went to climb over the fence and I slipped and then the spike went through my chin.

'I didn’t feel it. My friend starting being sick and that’s when I noticed what had happened.

'I just ripped myself off the fence and that’s when it ripped my skin.'

Bobby had been out playing with friends 
on Friday, September 13, when he climbed the fence around the fence, 
which surrounds a football field near to his home.

Lucky: The spike missed all of Bobby's major arteries, but he did have to have 15 stitches

Hospital: His mother Miss Lisa Valentine, pictured with Bobby above, was told about the accident by her cousin

He was taken to Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary, where he underwent surgery to repair the wound and had 15 stitches.

Medics at the hospital told his parents James Ward and Lisa Valentine he had been very lucky.

They were at home when the accident happened and a friend ran to their home to tell them what had happened.

Bobby's father, Mr Ward, 28, said: 'When I realised what had happened I was in complete shock.

'There was still skin on the fence.

Recovery: Bobby's family, left to right Tommy, 6, father Mr Ward, 28, mother Miss Lisa Valentine and baby Libby, were told the youngster was lucky to survive and have warned other children not to play on the railings

'I was just really worried - I was close to tears.

'My partner’s cousin lives next to where it happened and she said there was so much blood - it was like a murder-scene.'

Mr Ward is now warning other children of the dangers of climbing over fences.

The full-time father said: 'I know it was his own fault but this sort of fence is dangerous.'
