This is the moment a terrorist armed with a pump-action shotgun approaches the offices of a newspaper in Paris where he would shoot and critically wound a photographer.

Police have released CCTV of the wanted gunman who is the subject of a major manhunt in the French capital.

His victim, a 27-year-old, who has not been named, was on his first day at work in the headquarters of Liberation when he was shot in the chest and stomach.

Last night he had a six-hour operation and doctors said he was 'hovering between life and death'.

Nicolas 
Demorand, the editorial director of Liberation, said: 'We are the 
horrified witnesses of a tragedy.

'When someone walks into a newspaper 
with a gun, that's very, very serious in a democracy, regardless of the 
mental state of that person.

'If papers and other media have to become bunkers, something has gone wrong in our society.'

A
police spokesman said the Liberation photographer, an assistant who was
due to be working on a magazine shoot today, was in a 'critical 
condition' and 'hovering between life and death'.

The spokesman said CCTV film was being studied in an attempt to identify the attacker.

President Francois Hollande, on an official visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories, said 'all means' would be deployed to catch the attacker.

The
Liberation shooting comes just three days after an armed man burst into
the Paris offices of BFMTV, where he threatened journalists and staff, 
saying: 'Next time I won't miss you'.

Cartridges found at the scene of the BFMTV incident are thought to be the same as those found at Liberation's offices.

Liberation,
which has a circulation of around 140,000, was founded in 1973 by the 
intellectual philosopher Jean-Paul Satre and the journalist Serge July.
