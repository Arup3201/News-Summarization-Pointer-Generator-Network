The first manuscript page from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s second Sherlock Holmes story is returning to London after an absence of more than a century.

The handwritten manuscript from The Sign of Four in 1889 is said to be one of the rarest items known to enthusiasts of the fictional detective.

Sir Arthur's leaf of paper is the earliest manuscript page of the famous author’s Holmes collection to be sent to publishers and printed verbatim.

And the page includes references to the unconventional habits of the Baker Street literary legend - namely his taking of cocaine.

It is going on display at the Museum of London having been loaned by the University of California in San Diego, where it has resided since 1977.

Previously the manuscript changed hands at auction in New York in 1914 for $6 (£4) and again in 1929 for $50 (£31).

The first two paragraphs of the page - titled ‘Chapter I: The science of deduction’ - tell of Holmes injecting himself with ‘a 7 per cent solution’ of cocaine.

Holmes’s forearm and wrist are said to be ‘all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks’.

Location: The display coincides with the 125th anniversary of Sir Arthur completing the book, after it was commissioned at The Langham Hotel (above, in 1890) in 1889

He finds the drug so ‘transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment’.

The display coincides with the 125th anniversary of Sir Arthur completing the book, after it was commissioned at The Langham Hotel in London in 1889.

Sir Arthur took just one month to deliver his finished manuscript - and at the same meeting, Oscar Wilde was asked to write The Picture of Dorian Gray.

The museum says the page will form part of the largest temporary exhibition to be staged on Holmes in London since the Festival of Britain in 1951.

Alex Werner, lead curator of the museum’s exhibition, said: ‘Sherlock Holmes is a global icon indelibly linked to London.

‘As a mark of tribute to the 125th anniversary of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle completing his second Sherlock Holmes story, we have brought the first manuscript page of The Sign of Four back to the city which hosted its birth.’

On August 30, 1889, JM Stoddart of US literary publication Lippincott’s Magazine had dinner at The Langham with Wilde and Sir Arthur.

He commissioned them to write The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Sign of Four respectively, with Sir Arthur finishing his work on September 30.

Historic: The museum says it is holding the largest temporary exhibition to be staged on Holmes in London since the Festival of Britain in 1951

Nicholas Utechin, historian for the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, said: ‘The Langham dinner revived a career that was all but comatose.

‘Arthur Conan Doyle had published the first Sherlock Holmes story - A Study in Scarlet - two years earlier.'

Mr Utechin, who is also former editor of The Sherlock Holmes Journal, added: 'The tale was mentioned only in one or two small reviews.

‘It was this 1889 commission that resuscitated Sherlock Holmes, and without it, readers may never have met the character ever again.’

Tickets for the exhibition - which runs from October 17 until April 12, 2015 - are £12 for adults and £10 concessions. General entry to the museum is free.
