A Delta Airlines flight from Baltimore-Washington International Airport bound for Salt Lake City had to be diverted Friday night after a female passenger allegedly made sexual advances towards a fellow passenger.

The woman was reportedly intoxicated and became enraged when her advances were rebuffed.

The woman had to be handcuffed by airline staff until the plane could land at Minneapolis-Saint Paul and police could remove her from the plane.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Subdued: The woman was quiet as she was led from the plan after becoming unruly mid-air

A fellow passenger recorded two videos of the incident. In the first, expletive-filled recording, the woman can repeatedly be heard saying she will 'f***ing kill' the seatmate who rejected her advances and warning airline staff not to touch her.

'Hey, lady! Over there! I need help, this guy is holding me!' she implores a fellow passenger.

The woman continues ranting as the pilot apologizes to passengers of the PA and explains that the plane will be making an unscheduled stop to remove the unruly passenger.

According to the Salt Lake City Tribune, Patrick Hogan, a spokesman for Minneapolis-Saint Paul Airport confirmed the woman was 'very intoxicated' and was 'grabbing at passengers' on the plane.

The passenger who uploaded videos of the incident to YouTube said the woman 'had a few drinks' and made sexual advances to a male passenger. His refusal made her angry, she said, and the woman tried to 'raise her fist' to hit him.

The woman, who hasn't been named, could face federal charges for causing a disturbance while the plane was in flight.

Consequences: The woman may face federal charges for causing a disturbance in mid-air

The second video shows the woman, now much subdued, being led from the plane by police in Minneapolis.

After she was removed at about 8pm, the 737 aircraft and its 132 passengers continued on to Salt Lake City, reports Fox 13.

It landed an hour and a half late.

The woman was taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center.

Hogan has said Minneapolis-Saint Paul Airport will not press charges, but the FBI and TSA are investigating the incident and may prosecute.
