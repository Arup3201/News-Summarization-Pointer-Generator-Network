Disturbing video shows the moment a registered nurse was kicked out of an Atlantic City night club and yanked barefoot to a holding cell, where an off-duty police officer pushed and choked the woman who was just trying to celebrate at a friend's bachelorette party. 

Victim Amy Walsh, 26, and five others were celebrating a friend's pending nuptials on August 25, 2012 when they got into a confrontation with security at Harrah's Casino. 

A bouncer yanked the Metuchen, New Jersey resident out of the club and to a holding area in the casino, where an off-duty police officer got physical with her when she took out a phone to take his picture.

Amy Walsh was taken into custody at Harrah's Casino in August, 2012 and surveillance footage shows the ill treatment she received from an off-duty cop identified as Dayton Brown

The video, released as Walsh files a lawsuit against the hotel, shows Walsh being kicked out of the casino and then taken to a holding cell 

In the cell, Walsh starts struggling and the officer appears to choke her and even bang her head into the wall 

She hasn't field a lawsuit until now because she had just started a job at the time, and was ashamed. However, she heard of other people complaining about similar issues with the security at Harrah's and decided to final come out

Now Walsh is filing a lawsuit against the casino and her lawyers have released surveillance footage showing the painful detainment. 

In the video, Walsh is first seen exiting the Pool After Nightclub, being led by a man and woman who pull her barefoot across the casino floor. She stumbles at one point and is even led backwards before arriving at a security area in the hotel. 

She says her group of six was denied enough chairs for everyone at their table by the Harrah's manager, despite the fact they had a reservation.

Walsh was partying with five friends, celebrating a friend's pending nuptials, when she was kicked out of the hotel a nightclub that night

She says her group was denied a table for six, even though they had reservations at the casino 

Walsh was taken by two casino employees to a security area of the building 

'From the get-go he was not helpful, hostile, and at that point the situation escalated,' Walsh told NJ.com. 'The next thing I know I was being dragged without my shoes through the casino, cutting up my feet.'

She is next seen lifting her phone up to take a picture of two security guards, because she was upset and didn't know why she was being held. 

One of the security guards, identified as off-duty Atlantic City cop Dayton Brown, then grabbed the phone out of her hand and pushed her into an adjacent room. 

Officer Brown got violent with Walsh when she tried to snap his picture. He then pushed her into the holding room 

From there, Walsh starts to struggle and the officer just gets more violent, chocking her neck, shoving her onto a chair and banging her head into the wall.  

'It was brutal,' Walsh told NBC10. 'I really did fear for my life in that moment.'

Walsh was eventually charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and assaulting an officer. Her lawyers say those charges were later reduced. 

Walsh didn't report the battering at the time because she had just started a new job and was embarrassed of the incident. 

But she finally decided to come forward when she heard others had been roughed up by security at the casino as well.  

'I was ashamed but seeing the media coverage it gave me the courage to come forward,' she said. 'I said ‘Wow I’m not alone."'

Walsh filed a lawsuit in federal court on August 21, 2014 seeking unspecified damages.  

Walsh was charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and assaulting an officer, but those charges were later downgraded
