Security officials in Brisbane are grappling with the first major security breach ahead of this weekend's G20 summit, with two projectors, reportedly disguised as security cameras, found inside the restricted zone.

The projectors were going to be activated by remote control to beam anti-G20 slogans onto walls around the summit venue at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre, The Courier-Mail reports.

In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, Queensland Police said the devices were installed prior to new security restrictions.

The dummy cameras were found by police this week, just days out from the start of the gathering of world leaders on Saturday, the paper said, quoting a police source.

The paper said it was believed the cameras could be activated by mobile phone. 

World leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to converge on Brisbane at the weekend.  

Authorities have declared significant part of the city's CBD surrounding the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre a restricted area.
