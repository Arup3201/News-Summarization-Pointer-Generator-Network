A young woman died instantly after falling from a hotel balcony while on spring break at South Padre Island

Nereida Cruz, 21, had only been able to legally drink for 12 days before the incident on the seventh floor of the Padre South Hotel near the southern tip of Texas.

Alcohol is not believed to be a factor in her death at around 9am Wednesday morning, according to Cameron County judge Bennie Ochoa.

Nereida Cruz, 21, was killed instantly after falling from a seventh story balcony at a South Padre Island hotel. She had just turned the legal drinking age on March 6

Alcohol is not believed to be a factor in the death of Cruz, who traveled to the popular spring break destination with five friends

He said the death appeared to be accidental. 

'It is believed that she was perched on the balcony wall, kind of resting and moved to adjust herself and slipped and fell to her death,' South Padre Island police chief Randy Smith told KVEO.

The young woman and five friends were at the beachfront hotel for their holiday. 

Cruz was from Los Fresnos, only about 20 miles west of her vacation spot.

Other guests at the hotel described the 'heartbreaking' scene when the young woman's family were crying in the hotel lobby after Cruz's death.

Witnesses said that she was adjusting herself on the balcony ledge when she slipped, fell and received injuries to her head.

She turned 21 on March 6, according to ValleyCentral.com.

Texas Southmost College posted on Facebook that they were 'deeply saddened' by the news of their former student's death. 

She had studied nursing. 

An autopsy will be performed in nearby Harlingen. 

The death is the second in less than a week for the island, a popular spring break destination for Texans.

Ruben Diaz, 24, of Katy, Texas, was found dead of unknown causes at a private residence on South Padre on Saturday.

The young man suffered from seizures and foul play was not expected, the Houston Chronicle reported.
