A judge has described the UK’s borders as 'a leaking sieve' after an illegal immigrant drug dealer was deported three times only to return each time to commit more crimes.

Albanian national Baksim Bushati, 37,
 was sentenced to seven years in prison after he was found to have 
almost 1kg of cocaine worth £26,875 and £14,000 in cash at his home.

Since
 2005, he has been sentenced to prison terms totalling nearly five years
 for offences of violence, battery and possessing false identification.

Despite being deported from the UK following each jail term, he returned to commit more crimes.

Yesterday, Judge Richard Bray criticised the Government as he sentenced Bushati to his latest prison stretch, saying the UK’s borders 'leaked like a sieve.'

'These things make a classic study for people who want to see if the Home Office and the Border Agency are doing their jobs properly,' the judge told Northampton Crown Court.

'It just shows how powerless they appear to be. They are hopelessly undermanned and that is what has caused this situation.

'It is our duty to point this out so the public are aware of it.

'Leaking sieve': Judge Richard Bray said the Home Office and Border Agency were 'hopelessly undermanned', meaning Bushati could return to the UK three times despite being deported

2005: Bushati is jailed for three-and-a-half years for an offence of violence before being deported back to Albania

September 2010: Sent to prison for 54 weeks for possession of false identification documents. Is deported again but smuggles himself back into Britain.

January 2013: Bushati is jailed for 16 weeks for battery. It is again recommended he be deported on completing the sentence.

December 17, 2013: Tries to evade capture, only to be stopped by police dogs. Is found with £960 in cash, Albanian identification documents and two mobile phones.

February 5, 2014: Is sentenced to seven years in prison after he admits possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply.

'As I have been saying for the last 10 years, it is a very serious problem which is simply not being dealt with.

'Our defences to illegal immigrants are leaking like a sieve. I can only hope you will be successfully deported on this occasion.'

For his latest offence, Bushati, from Weedon, Northamptonshire, jumped out of a moving car to try and evade capture on December 17 last year before he was stopped by police dogs.

Jonathan
 Eley, prosecuting, said Bushati, who admitted possession of Class A 
drugs with intent to supply, was found with £960 cash, Albanian 
identification documents and two mobile phones.

'He gave a false address of Charles Street, Northampton, before officers traced him to his real home in Weedon,' he said.

'The defendant said his "life was over" and he was "done for" as a result of his arrest.'

Bushati
 was first jailed in the UK for three-and-a-half years in 2005 before 
being deported back to Albania on his release from prison.

But
 he managed to sneak back into Britain and in September 2010 he was sent
 to prison for 54 weeks for possession of false identification 
documents.

He was deported again but he just weeks after arriving in Albania he smuggled himself back into Britain.

In January 2013 he was jailed for 16 weeks for battery.

Maxine Crone, defending, said: 'He got himself into debt with people he was afraid of and it was they who provided him with the drugs, and effectively forced him to sell them.

'The trouble he’s had means he would prefer to be back in Albania.'

A Home Office spokesman said they 'do not routinely comment' on individual cases.

'The Government turned Border Force into its own separate command with a clear law enforcement ethos and security has been re-established as the priority,' said a spokesman.

'For the first time there is a clear operating mandate, set by ministers, and all passengers are now subject to full checks at the UK border.

'We have invested heavily both in staff and technology to improve security and keep out those with no right to be here.

'It will take time to transform all areas of Border Force but we are confident that we are making the right changes.'

Judge Bray is well known for his no-nonsense approach in court.

In November 2010 when he was handed a poem by a car thief asking for leniency he sentenced him to jail with his own rhyme.

Handing prolific crook Steven Snell to 20 months in prison, he rapped: 'Right now you feel down, You have got months to do, Despite what you done, Let us hope the locked door, will make you more sure not to come back for more.'

And in March 2013, he branded translation company Capita TI 'hopelessly incompetent' after an interpreter did not turn up for a case which was forced to adjourn.

Last year it was revealed that the now defunct UK Border Agency was dealing with a backlog of 320,000 cases, which was expected to take more than 20 years to clear.

Former chief Tony Smith blamed the problem on an influx of illegal immigrants who arrived in the UK between 2000 and 2003, many of whom have since changed their names and become untraceable.

The agency has now been split into two sections, one to deal with immigration visas and one to deal with immigration law enforcement, which operates as Border Force.

There has also been growing tensions within the coalition over immigration and border control.

Last year the Tories accused the Lib Dems by accusing them of holding back anti-immigration measures, and the Lib Dems accusing the Home Office of dragging its feet over plans to reinstate exit checks at borders to tackle illegal immigration.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg had objected to a pilot scheme to drive vans around bearing posters telling illegal immigrants to ‘Go home or face arrest’.

His party also tried to scale back plans for immigration bonds – £3,000 payments on top of visas issued to visitors from high-risk countries, repayable only upon leaving Britain.
