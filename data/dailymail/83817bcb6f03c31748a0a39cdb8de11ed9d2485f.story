Workers cleaning out the home of an elderly woman in Alaska who died found a secret treasure trove of memorabilia from the Nuremberg war tribunal.

The documents and photographs were contained in a locked trunk in the home of Maxine Carr, who moved to Anchorage after the war.

When workers from the Alaska Auction Company went through the trunk looking for valuables, they discovered carbon copies of transcripts from the war trial tribunal. 

Maxine Carr worked as a stenographer at the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal for 32 months 

Her amazing story came to light after auctioneers discovered a trunk packed with memorabilia at her home

Mrs Carr kept documentation from the tribunal including letters from senior Nazis on a range of matters

They also found identification cards belonging to Mrs Carr proving that she had worked at the historic trial. 

They also found a staff directory for the multinational tribunal that prosecuted scores of Nazi masterminds in those infamous trials, a translated letter to Nazi faithful that signs off with 'Heil Hitler' and personal credentials and correspondence belonging to a lowly postwar stenographer who squirreled the mementos away for decades.

Christine Hill, who owns the auction house with her husband Duane said: 'It was chilling, very chilling going through that paperwork. Very unsettling.'

The Carr collection is been sold as one lot and should be of interest to military historians and collectors of World War II memorabilia.  

Mrs Carr worked at the tribunal for 32 months. 

In November 1945, the landmark Nuremberg trials began. Twelve of the 23 defendants, including Hitler aide Hermann Goering, were sentenced to death.

Almost seven decades after the war, many institutions, including the Harvard Law School Library, have extensive collections of Nuremberg trial documentation, said Ed Moloy, curator of modern manuscripts at the Harvard library. While the Carr collection is interesting, it's likely not particularly unique, he said.

Christine Hill, pictured with her husband Duane said reading the Carr collection was quite 'chilling' 

Among the documents held in the collection are a list of the senior Nazis who were on trial for their lives 

The special collection will be auctioned with other Nazi-era memorabilia on Saturday in Anchorage, Alaska

But it might appeal to a private collector who wants such documents that are not already housed in a repository such as the Harvard library, which has 600 linear feet of Nuremberg documents.

Mr Moloy said: 'It's very possible that people like Miss Carr, who was part of this pool of civilians working to support the trials, ended up with extra copies or something and saved them for souvenirs,' 

'That's what I would assume this collection is.'

Last year, other Nuremberg documents surfaced in Israel at a flea market in Tel Aviv. That 500-page haul eventually ended up at auction, too, where they sold for a price tag in the $10,000 range.

Personal correspondence found in the trunk also hints of dissatisfaction with her position as a clerk-stenographer with the Civil Aeronautics Administration for war-training service before the war trials started. 

The Carr collection is being sold without any reserve in one lot on Saturday according to the auctioneers 

The sale includes a large amount of other Nazi memorabilia including flags, medals and badges 

Carr received a job rating of 'fair' in 1944, and she filed an unsuccessful appeal to the Civil Service Commission to amend the evaluation to 'very good.'

'I performed a great deal more work than any other girl assigned to the same type of position, and I certainly believe that I should receive a higher rating than "Fair" for work completed, especially considering the unfavorable circumstances under which I had to work,' Carr wrote. 

In a May 1945 letter from the Efficiency Rating Board of Review, the board chair said Carr 'had not altogether convincingly rebutted' her supervisors' work appraisals. 

The Carr collection is being auctioned as one lot, with no minimum bidding set. Several other private collections of mementos from that era also are being auctioned and include Nazi arm bands, German and Russian medals, and a tiny Hitler propaganda booklet. 

There also are plenty of Alaska artifacts, such as ivory carvings, old photographs, even black bear and coyote head mounts.

Little is known about Carr's time in Alaska, although a state fishing license was issued to her in 1951, when she was 29 years old. 

While in Alaska, she eventually used her married name, Maxine Sud, according state records. Carr died at least a decade ago, but it's not clear exactly when she passed away.

Her 91-year-old widower, Chand Sud, lives in an Anchorage assisted living facility. Through the auction house, he declined to comment to The Associated Press.

Hill said the widower was surprised to learn about the documents, although he knew of her Nuremberg past.
