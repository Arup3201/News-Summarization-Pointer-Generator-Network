A high-risk sex offender accused of raping and murdering five women went unmonitored during his killing spree because his GPS bracelet had been removed.

According to court documents, Steven Gordon, 45, went unmonitored for two weeks because he was allowed to take the tracker off.

During this time he allegedly lured the prostitutes off the street in Orange County, California, and disposed of their bodies in bins in Anaheim.

Gordon, who is facing the charges alongside accomplice Frank Cano, was allowed to take off the GPS when he finished his parole in November 2013, according to the LA Times.

Just a few days later a judge discovered that he was homeless, and ordered that the tag be put back on.

However it took two weeks for the U.S. Probabtion and Pre-trial System to replace it.

During that time one of his alleged victims disappeared in that time and was presumably killed.

Prosecutors say they doubt that this delay prevented the woman's death because both Gordon and Cano were wearing trackers at the time of the alleged attacks. The Times have also revealed that the pair had a history of cutting off their bracelets and fleeing the state. 

Both defendants have pleaded not guilty.

When Gordon was arrested, he told Anaheim police Detective Julissa Trapp that he had not been wearing the anklet for a period of time told the grand jury.

The transcript contains little new information about the 28-year-old Cano.

Trapp reported that Gordon first said Cano didn't know of Gordon's plans to strangle the women. But by the end of the interview, Gordon said Cano had strangled each woman while Gordon punched them in the stomach to 'get the air out faster.' 

The women were then stripped of their clothes, washed and placed in a Dumpster.

The body of the final woman killed, 21-year-old Jarrae Nykkole Estepp of Oklahoma, was found on a conveyor belt at a trash-recycling plant in Anaheim but the bodies of the other three have never been found.

The fifth woman, referenced by Gordon in the interview, has not been identified and the two are not charged in her death.

The two were arrested on April 11 after Estepp's body was found the month before.

Police believe Cano and Gordon have known each other since at least 2010, when Cano cut off his GPS device and fled to Alabama, where he was arrested with Gordon.

Two years later, in 2012, they again snipped off their monitoring devices and boarded a Greyhound bus to Las Vegas using fake names.  The men were arrested by federal agents on May 8, 2012, after a two-week stay at Circus Circus Hotel & Casino, according to federal court documents.

Gordon traveled using the alias Dexter McCoy and Cano chose Joseph Madrid, authorities said.

Cano and Gordon were previously ordered to register as sex offenders after being convicted in separate cases of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14.

Gordon was convicted in 1992 and also has a 2002 kidnapping conviction, while Cano's conviction dates back to 2008.

Crime scene: Estepp's body was recovered from Anaheim's Republic Waste Services in March 

The first woman to disappear was Kianna Jackson, 20, of Las Vegas, who arrived in Santa Ana in October 2013 for a court hearing on misdemeanor charges of prostitution and loitering to commit prostitution. 

Her mother said she stopped responding to her text messages soon after she arrived.

Josephine Monique Vargas, 34, was last seen October 24, 2013, after leaving a family birthday party to go to a store.

Martha Anaya, 28, asked her boyfriend to pick up their 5-year-old daughter so she could work on November 12, 2013, but then stopped responding to his messages later that night.

Police said she also had a history of prostitution.

Estepp's mother, Jodi Michelle Pier-Estepp, said her daughter had a troubled past but was working to turn her life around when she traveled to California to visit her brother and stopped in Orange County along the way.

When they were arrested, Cano and Gordon had been living in a car and on the streets. Gordon had a job cleaning cars at an auto body shop in Anaheim.
