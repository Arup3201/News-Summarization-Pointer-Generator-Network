It was supposed to be a period drama to rival Downton Abbey.

But viewers hoping for an upbeat Easter Sunday’s viewing were presented with misery, depression and violence.

Episode one of The Village on BBC was voted a miss by Twitter users and seems unlikely to match the success of ITV’s stately home series.

Viewers claimed the corporation had badly misjudged its Sunday night scheduling with the period drama set in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Many were so irritated with the persistent gloom that they switched off altogether.

One viewer, Zoe, wrote: 'Don’t think I can watch any more of The Village – want to end the week on a high not a low.'

Sharing her view Sarah, another Twitter user, said: 'I don’t need my drama to be all hearts and flowers and happy endings but I struggle with unrelenting grimness in The Village.'

In the first hour, the show dubbed a 'misery-fest' by many commenting online, contained scenes of domestic violence, crops failing, alcoholism, canings in school and the protagonist’s elder brother being packed off to war.

A third viewer, Kirsty Bramley, tweeted: 'The Village is depressing viewing for a Sunday evening. Not sure if I’ll tackle the next episode. It’ll all end in tears.'

There was some praise on the social media website however for John Simm, who plays drunken wife-beater John Middleton.

Written by Bafta-winner Peter Moffat, The Village charts the life and turbulent times of an English community over the decades.

Residents of the picturesque Peak District villages in which it is filmed are hopeful it will attract 'coach loads' of tourists.

Cobbled streets and buildings from the picturesque villages of Hayfield, Edale, Chapel-en-le-Frith and Old Glossop were all used.

Jill Nagy, 46, landlady of the George Hotel in Hayfield, Derbyshire, said: 'We’re all very excited about The Village.

'I’m hoping it will provide a boost for the town and encourage coach loads of tourists.'

Juliet Stevenson and Maxine Peake also star in the six-part series.
