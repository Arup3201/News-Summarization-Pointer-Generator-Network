Rumours of an all-in-one Apple TV set, that will broadcast live shows, has been on the cards since 2011 - but another launch event has passed without it making an appearance.

Now Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook has revealed that TV is an area the firm continues to have great interest in, but admitted ‘if we’re really honest, it’s stuck back in the seventies.’

Mr Cook made the claims on the Charlie Rose Show in the US.

During an interview with US chat show host Charlie Rose, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) said: ‘TV is [a product] we continue to have interest in, but it's stuck back in the seventies. When you go in your living room to watch the TV, it almost feels like you’re rewinding the clock'

‘The hardest decisions we make are all the things not to work on,‘ Mr Cook told the chat show host.

‘There’s lots of things we have interest in, but we know we can’t do everything great.’

When asked if TV was one of those examples, Mr Cook replied: ‘TV is one that we continue to have great interest in, but TV is one of those things that, if we’re really honest, it's stuck back in the seventies.

Rumours of an all-in-one Apple TV set, that will broadcast live shows, has been on the cards since 2011.

Earlier this year, reports claimed Apple's plans to take on TV with a gadget capable of showing live TV had been delayed until next year.

Apple engineers working on the gadget were told not to expect it to launch until 2015, and the delay was blamed on cable companies refusing to do deal. 

Rumours claim Apple's TV set will use a 4K screen making is four times sharper than even current HDTV pictures.

The firm is also rumoured to be working with cable firms to allow it to show live TV, as well as films and TV shows.

It is also expected to be able to run apps, and work with an iPad or iPhone as a remote control.

‘Think about how much your life has changed, and yet when you go in your living room to watch the TV, it almost feels like you’re rewinding the clock, and you've entered a time capsule.'

He continued that the ‘interface is terrible' and people only watch shows when they come on, unless they remember to record them. 

However, PC Pro's Barry Collins believes Mr Cook is wrong. 

Mr Collins wrote: 'The stress of last week’s big Apple announcements must be getting to Tim Cook. 

'The man needs a holiday. 

'That can be the only explanation for some bizarre comments he made over the weekend, when he was asked about Apple’s TV plans.'

He then goes on to explain all the ways in which TV has developed and advanced since the large, bulky sets of the 70s and the piles of videos using a series of pictures.

Similarly, finance journalist Aaron Pressman tweeted: 'TV is stuck in the 70s? It’s too annoying to pay by credit card? @tim_cook needs to get out of his Apple bubble a bit more.'

Apple TV’s streaming box (latest generation model pictured) was initially unveiled as iTV in 2006

Apple TV’s streaming box was initially unveiled as iTV in 2006, and was a product the late chief executive Steve Jobs was said to have been keen on.

The latest generation model launched in March 2012.

It supports 1080p content from iTunes and Netflix, and it has more recently added CNBC channel with live broadcasts, and FOX NOW - the on-demand app for the network that includes episodes of Glee, Family Guy and more. 

Apple sold more than $1 billion of Apple TV set-top boxes during 2013 year and is ‘investing heavily in the next generation of products’, boss Tim Cook said at the company's annual meeting earlier this year.

The firm is believed to be working on a range of TV sets alongside an improved version of its current $99 TV box.

Future versions are expected to include apps and the ability to watch live TV as well as buy movies and TV shows.
