Michael Williams, 44, of Saginaw, Michigan,  poses for a booking photo, in Michigan

 A passenger accused of stabbing four people  according to court documents released on Monday.

Michael D. Williams was arraigned on Monday on attempted murder charges and requested a court-appointed attorney. 

A judge entered a not-guilty plea on his behalf and ordered him held in the Berrien County jail on $1 million bond.

The 44-year-old Saginaw native is accused of stabbing a conductor and three fellow passengers on Friday night when the train stopped in Niles, about 10 miles north of South Bend, Indiana. 

Police rushed to the train and subdued Williams with a stun gun.

He later told detectives that the 'guy he was talking to on the train turned into a demon and he had to fight' him, according to court documents.

Police said the victims were in stable condition. The train with 172 passengers was traveling from Chicago to Port Huron, which is 60 miles northeast of Detroit.

A sister, Tracy Williams, told The Saginaw News that she spoke to her brother last week. She said her brother seemed to be hallucinating and feared for his life as he tried to get to Saginaw.

'We were having conversations back and forth, and I said, `You know, Mike, this doesn't make any sense. Why are they after you?' Tracy Williams said. 

'Whatever he believed in his head was real to him. Nothing I could have said could make him think any different.'

She said her brother is a military veteran who moved to Atlanta last summer to get a commercial driver's license and work as a cross-country trucker.

'My heart goes out to the victims because they were innocent,' Tracy Williams said.

'He wasn't specifically targeting them. They did absolutely nothing to deserve this.'

Williams returns to court on Friday. 

'Preliminary charges authorized by the Berrien County Prosecutor's Office are four counts of assault with intent to murder. Each charge holds a maximum life sentence,' police said in a news release.

Aftermath: Officers with Niles police arrive at the Amtrak train after Williams had been subdued by a Taser

'When officers arrived at the Amtrak depot they observed a commotion on one of the train cars with numerous passengers exiting that car quickly,' Niles Police Chief Jim Millin said in an earlier statement.

 'Officers pushed their way onto the train past the passengers exiting and were immediately confronted by a male subject armed with a knife. Officers quickly subdued the subject with the use of a Taser and he was taken into custody without further incident.'

'Medical aid was quickly administered to the victims who were then transported to area hospitals by S.M.C.A.S. Ambulance of Niles,

Investigators don't believe Williams knew the victims. Police said Monday that the victims were in stable condition.

Williams was riding the train from Chicago to Port Huron, about 60 miles northeast of Detroit. Police say he's from Saginaw, in central Michigan.
