In Natal on Tuesday, with just 12 minutes to go between Uruguay and Italy, Luis Suarez appeared to sink his teeth into the should of Giorgio Chiellini.

At the time the referee failed to spot the incident, but FIFA have now got involved, stating on their official website that they are set to investigate the 27-year-old's actions.

Uruguay and Suarez have until 5pm local time (9pm BST) on Wednesday to provide evidence, and FIFA could ban the forward for up to two years.

But what should his punishment be? Here, Sportsmail experts off their opinions on how they think Suarez should be disciplined...

Indefinite suspension from all football world-wide and to serve a minimum of six months.

Ban only to be lifted after mandatory counselling and an independent psychological evaluation that he is mentally fit to return.

Laura WilliamsonLuis Suarez needs a 10-match international ban as an absolute minimum but, more importantly, there must be a rehabilitative element to his punishment.

Tuesday night's incident scarred the game, the World Cup and Uruguay, but also Suarez's club, Liverpool, and the Premier League and cannot be allowed to happen again.

Bans and fines clearly have little impact, so something else must be done to get through to this brilliantly talented but ultimately flawed footballer.Sami MokbelIt's hard to say how long his ban should be - but it should certainly be a suspension that applies to both international and club football.

A suspension for solely international fixtures wouldn't be suffice. If his ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic was 10 games - then his forthcoming punishment should certainly be double that.

Laurie WhitwellIt is clear Suarez should play no further part in this World Cup or any football for a long time.Chomping at another person on three separate occasions shows a mental problem that will only be recognised as such by Suarez if the world governing body show their teeth.

A year-long ban wouldn't be too much in my opinion, while a permanent gum shield on his return should be considered. Seriously.

I would also question those who have condoned his behaviour. Manager Oscar Tabarez, captain Diego Lugano, and Gaston Ramirez (who tried to cover up Chiellini's bite marks) should face a grilling.

Six months. Until the turn of the year. Not sure he'll ever take responsibility for anything he does but I'd throw the book at him. Needs to be properly punished. Matt BarlowWhat a shame it will be to see Suarez removed from this thrilling tournament; to take the edge from what promises to be a fabulous last 16 tie between Uruguay and Colombia.

But FIFA must deliver a heavy punishment, a ban of 10 international games say. It is akin to assault and he has previous but he has not badly injured anyone. I don't see any reason to ban him from all football. That would not occur with any other type of on-field assault.

Riath Al-SamarraiIt's a difficult one, because the disciplinary precedents for this involve the same man. This man. This strange, gifted man. By using what has been ruled before, it needs to be more than 10 games.

But how many? Is it worse than kicking a fan (Eric Cantona, nine months)? I don't think it is. Is it worse than Joey Barton's rampage against Manchester City in 2012 (12 matches)? I'd say so.

And this is a repeat offender. He clearly needs more effective psychological help than he has so far received. But with it should come a significant action - a six-month ban from competitive football at any level. A Hannibal Lecter mask might also help.   Ian LadymanThe incident should be judged on its merits. The hysteria that has surrounded it is natural but FIFA should follow their own rules and ban him for three games - no more - for violent conduct.Rob DraperWhat will happen? Three or four match FIFA ban.

It's a first offence - the other two occasions took place under different jurisdictions so are irrelevant.

What should happen? Psychiatric counselling for what I would imagine is a serious condition which seems to manifest itself in stressful situations. And a worldwide 15-match ban to impress on Suarez the seriousness of the situation.
