A £175 Burberry shirt modelled by Romeo Beckham in a fashion shoot for Vogue magazine has been found to be contaminated with toxic chemicals.

The shirt was among a number of children’s items that were tested as part of a Greenpeace investigation into the use of potentially harmful chemicals during manufacturing.

The same research found suspect residues in products sold by other big brands such as Disney, American Apparel, GAP and Primark.

There is no evidence that the levels of chemicals found would cause immediate harm to children wearing them, however Greenpeace argues they should be removed on a precautionary basis.

Eleven-year-old Romeo, who is the second of David and Victoria Beckham’s four children, was hired by Burberry last year to front a high profile marketing campaign.

Following his designer mother into the fashion world, he was hand-picked by Burberry’s chief creative officer, Christopher Bailey.

The campaign saw him wearing a purple metallic shirt alongside models Edie Campbell and Cara Delavingne as part of the Spring/Summer 2013 collection in a photo-shoot by the renowned Mario Testino.

The shirt was tested as part of the Greenpeace Detox campaign investigation and was found to contain a relatively high level - 780 mg/kg – of nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs).

NPEs are man-made chemicals that are widely used as surfactants or detergents by textiles manufacturers during the manufacture of the cloth.

Once released to the environment, NPEs degrade to nonylphenols (NP), which are known to be toxic and act as hormone disrupters. They will accumulate in the body over time.

The £175 shirt was made in Tunisia and purchased in the UK from the firm’s online store.

Greenpeace said there is absolutely no criticism of the Beckhams, however it said manufacturers such as Burberry should do more to remove suspect chemicals from the production process and their garments.

Burberry insisted its products do not pose any risk to customers.

The successful British brand said it is working with Greenpeace to reduce the use of suspect chemicals in the manufacturing process.

A spokesman said: ‘The safety and welfare of our customers is paramount and Burberry complies with all international environmental and safety standards. Burberry products do not pose a danger to customers.’

Graham Thompson, a spokesman for the Greenpeace Detox campaign, said: ‘Until the textile industry detox and switch to safer chemicals, we’ll all be exposed to these hazardous substances.

‘Whether you are a child from a poor background living downstream from the factories in Asia or Africa, or the wearer of a £175 shirt, all are impacted.

‘The Greenpeace Detox campaign has been working with major fashion labels to solve this problem.

'We want to help Burberry become a real market leader by joining  the forward-thinking brands already committed to being part of the solution.’
