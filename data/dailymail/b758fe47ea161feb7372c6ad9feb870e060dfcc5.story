A high-flying Ministry of Defence mandarin has quit his £200,000 post during an inquiry into whether he had an inappropriate relationship with his chief of staff.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Andrew Manley, 57, a married father of two, resigned before the conclusion of the MoD probe into his relationship with Laura Clare, 32.

The investigation by defence chiefs also examined his expenses, which included 47 nights spent in a luxury hotel and spa.

Mr Manley submitted a £5,542 bill after staying at the 800-year-old New Hall Hotel and Spa in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, where rooms can cost £155 a night.

He confirmed last night that he had quit and, when asked whether he had an affair with Ms Clare, said: ‘No comment.’

This newspaper understands that the MoD’s investigation was nearing its end when Mr Manley stepped down from his position as chief executive of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, a department responsible for managing land and properties worth billions of pounds.

The internal inquiry, which was not intended to be made public, was triggered by his expense claims, which reached £13,743, and by internal emails sent by Mr Manley.

Last night, sources close to Mr Manley disclosed that the senior civil servant intends to mount a number of legal actions against his former employers.

Mr Manley spent 30 years at the oil company Shell before joining the MoD as a commercial director in charge of procurement. He was later promoted to head the newly formed DIO.

He lives in a £1.5million home on a private estate in Cobham, Surrey, with his wife Pauline and their children.

In 2011 Ms Clare joined the DIO as his private secretary before being rapidly promoted to become his chief of staff on a salary of as much as £59,535.

She is said to be highly regarded by her bosses and continues to work for the DIO. Although she is understood to have been questioned by the inquiry, she was not under investigation herself.

The probe into the relationship between Mr Manley and Ms Clare began in January this year. At the time he was suspended on full pay. The MoD says that Mr Manley left his post on March 20. It was unclear last night whether Mr Manley will retain any pension entitlements.

Last night an MoD spokesman said: ‘Following an internal investigation we can confirm that Andrew Manley decided to repudiate his contract with the department on March 20. He is no longer employed by the MoD.’

Ms Clare, who lives in a flat in Putney, South-West London, yesterday declined to comment on the  latest developments.

Earlier this year it emerged that Mr Manley had already offered his resignation to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond over a bungled Information Technology project.

Mr Manley told colleagues that delays in a new computer system would cost about £20million and that he had offered his resignation as a result.

In a recording leaked to the media, Mr Manley said: ‘I have said to the Secretary of State, “If you feel that this is significantly bad and you want me to step down, I am happy to do it because in the world I came from, the chief executive would probably have been fired for what has gone wrong.” ’

In the past four years, defence chiefs have spent £180million of taxpayers’ money on car hire and hotels on business trips in the UK alone, according to the latest figures. The total bill for hotels over that period was £3 million.

The MoD also paid almost £3,000 for a Sky Sports contract for one small unit in Northwood, Hertfordshire, so it could monitor ‘global 24-hour news feeds’.

Another big spender was the MoD’s Chief of Defence Materiel Bernard Gray, who racked up a £23,000 bill for 106 overnight stays in London and Bristol – even though his home is just a 60-mile drive from both cities and he has an official car and driver.
