Accused: Ian Watkins, lead singer of the Lostprophets, faces 24 child sex charges which he denies

A young mother due to stand trial with Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins today admitted sexually touching a child.

Watkins, 35, is accused of 24 sex offences including the rape of a baby who was aged under 12 months.

Watkins and two mothers, aged 20 and 24, were arrested by police investigating allegations of sex offences.

The younger woman - who cannot be named but is from the Doncaster area - today admitted sexually touching the child, making an indecent photo of the child, and distributing the image.

Watkins - a former boyfriend of TV presenter Fearne Cotton - appeared at court via video link from prison during for an hour-long hearing ahead of his trial.

The case is scheduled to go before a jury at Cardiff Crown Court on November 25 after a judge rejected an application to have it moved.

Alexia Power, defending, said: 'Watkins, although a celebrity in other parts of the world, was more well known in Wales.

'He is a man who has maintained his links to his home town - he is a local celebrity. The fact that he finds himself where he is is a spectacular fall from grace.'

But Recorder of Cardiff Judge Eleri Rees said: 'Watkins previously had a high profile in the music world. I cannot recommend moving this case as this will be a factor wherever in the country it is heard.'

Watkins also faces a charge of aiding and abetting the sexual assault of another child who was aged one at the time.

The singer, of Pontypridd, South Wales, is also accused of conspiracy to rape and conspiracy to sexually assault the same child.

He also denies further charges of possessing, taking and making indecent photographs of children - the oldest of dating back to March 2007.

The singer is accused of possessing an extreme pornographic image featuring a person having sex with an animal.

Watkins has been in custody since December last year and appeared by video link from Parc Prison in Bridgend, South Wales.

Another woman, 24, and from the Bedford area is charged alongside Watkins. She denies all allegations.

A jury will be told about the 20-year-old woman's three guilty pleas at the opening of the eventual trial.

Judge Rees adjourned proceedings until August 12 for a case management hearing at the same court.
