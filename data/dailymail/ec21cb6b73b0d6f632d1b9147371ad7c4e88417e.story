On the run: Police believe Rocco Luka Magnotta might have fled the country after hacking up his alleged victim

A low-budget porn actor suspected of dismembering a man and mailing his body parts to Canadian government headquarters may have fled the country, police believe.

Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, is the subject 
of a massive manhunt after a man's maggot-ridden torso was found in a 
locked suitcase by his Montreal apartment block.

The city's police commander, Ian Lafreniere, said investigators believe he has left North America based on evidence they found at his apartment, and based on a blog post Magnotta once wrote about how to disappear.

The suspected killer has also been added to Interpol's wanted person's list.

'We believe he may be in a foreign country,' Lafreniere told The Associated Press. 'He left a letter on a website mentioning how to disappear for good, and secondly, our investigation brought us some details that might let us think that he could be away from the country.'

The police commander added that investigators have an idea where he might have fled but he would not say where.

It comes after claims Magnotta allegedly filmed himself hacking up his victim's body with an ice-pick before posting the sickening video online.

The sickening 'snuff video' footage, called '1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick' which was uploaded last week shows a naked male tied to a bed frame being attacked with both an ice pick and a kitchen knife.

The Best Gore website says the film, which is unclear where or when it was filmed, then shows the victim being stabbed and having his throat slashed to the soundtrack of True Faith by New Order.

Wanted: Luka Magnotta is believed to be behind a gruesome video showing the murder of a man

He is later decapitated, dismembered and sexually assaulted. It is believed he was already dead when the camera started rolling.

The man in the video, whose face is never revealed, then goes on to play with the corpse's body parts in a 'sexual manner'.

Doubt was initially cast on the veracity of the film but police have now confirmed 'it depicts the actual crime', the National Post reports.

Lafreniere said police have been 
trying to take down the video that they believe shows Magnotta 
committing the murder. Despite repeatedly removing it, people continue 
to upload it, he said.

Inside look: Police believe he may have fled the country after a blog post he wrote about disappearing

Police
believe a festering foot from the body was then mailed to Canadian 
Conservative Party's HQ, and a hand was found at a postal warehouse, 
both in Ottawa, Ontario.

Officers believe he could also be behind a sickening video posted online where kittens are tortured and killed.

The
animal-cruelty video, filmed two years ago, shows a man looking like 
Magnotta placing two kittens inside an airtight bag and using a vacuum 
cleaner to suck out the air.

In
distressing scenes, too graphic to be posted on MailOnline, the cleaner
is then switched on and the air is slowly sucked out of the bag. The 
mewing kittens can be seen wriggling around and clawing to escape as the
polythene tightens around them.

After switching off the cleaner, the 
sick teen opens the bag and proudly holds up the body of one of the 
kittens for his camera, before displaying them on his bed.

Killing: A video of the killing, perhaps taken in this apartment block, shows the beheading of a victim

Home: The victim, believed to already be dead in the video, was then sexually assaulted and dimembered

Investigation: An internal shot of Magnotta's apartment before the furniture was removed

Earlier this week, police in masks combed 
through the blood-soaked Montreal studio apartment where the torso was 
discovered. A blood stained mattress remained there after they left.

Police
Commander Ian Lafreniere said: 'For most of the officers that were 
there all night long this is the kind of crime scene they've never seen 
in their career.'

He said 
they are investigating the possibility that other body parts might have 
been mailed, and believed the suspect and the victim knew each other.

The packages with the foot and the hand, he added, had been mailed to Ottawa from Montreal. But it was not clear why.

Lafreniere added: 'As a father, I would have trouble sleeping at night knowing that the suspect was in my neighborhood.'

Police said Magnotta is also known by 
the names Eric Clinton Newman and Vladimir Romanov. They described him 
as white, 5ft 8in tall, with blue eyes and black hair.

Hazardous material: A police officer carries a yellow bag with the bloody package that contains the festering foot mailed to Conservative Party headquarters on Tuesday

Scene: Sick idea: The Tories have said they believe that, even though the package was addressed to Conservative Party headquarters, the foot was not a political message

His internet presence indicates he is a bisexual porn actor and model.

Police
discovered the severed foot after Jenni Bryne, a top political adviser 
to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, opened a bloodstained box at 
Conservative party headquarters on Tuesday.

When
Bryne opened the box, a foul odor overcame the office. 'It was such a 
horrible odour. I'm sure many of us will not forget it,' Conservative 
Party spokesman Fred DeLorey said.

Police
said the package was addressed to the Conservative Party of Canada and 
not to a specific person. Canada Post would not comment on the 
discoveries.

Eric Schorer, the manager of the 
building where the suspect lived, said Magnotta had been living there 
for about four months but had not been seen around in a while.

He
said there were never any complaints about noise in the unit, and that 
Magnotta passed a credit test to rent there. 'He seemed like a nice 
guy,' Schorer said.

Manhunt: Magnotta is also known by the names Eric Clinton Newman and Vladimir Romanov

Friendly: This video, posted online two years ago, shows a man who looks like Magnotta appearing to be caring for the cats (he disguised his face)

Sickening: But the man then seals the bag, attaches the vacuum cleaner hose and sucks the air out of it

Richard Payette, who lived across the hall from Magnotta, said the door of Apartment 208 was left open for part of the day yesterday, with an overwhelming smell drifting out into the hallway, like bad meat.

For nearly two years, Magnotta's name has been notorious among animal-rights activists looking for a man who tortured and killed cats and posted videos of it online.

In 2009, he posted an article online entitled How to Completely Disappear and Never Be Found; it shares a six-step process for escaping and changing an identity.

It is not the first time he has been in the news. Magnotta previously complained his life had been ruined by rumours he was dating Karla Homolka, who raped and killed teenage girls.

Reports add he may have spread the rumours himself, The Canadian Press reported. Magnotta has no criminal record.
