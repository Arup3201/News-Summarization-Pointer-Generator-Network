Ed Miliband today condemned Education Secretary Michael Gove as an 'absolute disgrace' after suggesting families become who use food banks have only their own ‘decisions' to blame.

In angry exchanges in the Commons, the Labour leader challenged David Cameron to distance himself from the remarks.

And he challenged the Tory frontbench to trying living on £150-a-week.

Clash: David Cameron was challenged in the Commons by Labour leader Ed Miliband over the remarks by Education Secretary Michael Gove

Earlier this week Mr Gove argued that people who find themselves 
unable to buy essentials, including food and school uniforms have 
themselves to blame for being unable ‘to manage their finances’.

Mr Miliband said the remarks showed the Government to be out-of-touch with the lives of ordinary people.

In an increasingly bitter exchange, Mr Miliband said: 'Here is the reality - you want to give maximum support to millionaires so you give them a tax cut. But it's a different story for those who go to food banks.

'And we know what this Government thinks of people who go to food banks because the Children's Secretary (Mr Gove) said that people who go to food banks only have themselves to blame.'

As he faced a heckling from the government benches, Mr Miliband hit back: 'One of the Tory MPs is groaning, it just shows how out of touch this Conservative Party is.'

He demanded to know if Mr Cameron agreed with Mr Gove but did not get an answer.

Mr Miliband went on: 'The Prime 
Minister neither defended the Children's Secretary's comments, nor 
distanced himself from them. Let me just tell you, the Children's 
Secretary is an absolute disgrace.'

Pointing at the Government 
frontbench, he added: 'Let's see any of them try to live on £150 a week 
and then we will see what happens.

'We have one million young people out
of work, unemployment up in half the country, millions of people worse 
off while millionaires get a tax cut. For the few not the many, you are a
two-nation Prime Minister.'

But Mr Cameron said he did not have to
take any lectures from Labour on food banks, telling MPs their use 
increased 10 times under the last government.

More than half a million people across Britain have turned to food banks to stave off hunger, according to charities.

Ministers have previously argued that a surge in demand has in part been fuelled by jobcentre staff being allowed to refer the unemployed to food banks for help.

Cuts to benefits, frozen or falling wages and rising living costs have been blamed in part for some people struggling to make ends meet.

On Monday Mr Gove was challenged over reports that one in four parents are having to borrow to pay for school uniforms and some food banks were distributing uniforms to struggling parents.

He said he had recently visited a food bank in his Surrey Health constituency.

But he suggested that many cash-strapped families have brought their problems on themselves.

He added: ‘I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures.

‘Those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances.

‘We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.’

Mr Gove was responding to a question from Labour frontbencher Luciana Berger who demanded to know ‘what more can he and his Government do to ensure that no students turn up to school embarrassed because they do not have the right clothes’.

Last night Miss Berger said she was ’appalled’ by Mr Gove’s comments. The Labour Liverpool MP added: ’People I have met are ashamed to have to turn to food banks.

’I vehemently disagree it is because they have mismanaged their finances.

’This Government has got no answer to the millions of parents that are really struggling to get by.’

Citizens Advice Chief Executive Gillian Guy said: ’It is appalling to suggest the rise of food banks is due to poor financial management.

’It’s a smack in the face to families who are working hard but can’t make ends meet, leaving them with no other option but to turn to food banks to feed their families.

’These comments are completely misjudged.’

Chris Johnes, director of Oxfam's UK Poverty Programme, said: 'Thousands are now turning to food banks, but they do not so out of choice, they do so when they have nowhere else to turn.

'The staggering rise in the numbers of people using food banks is down to failings in the benefit system, too many low paid jobs and rising prices that are dragging huge numbers into poverty.'

In May a report by Church Action On Poverty and Oxfam suggested up to half of those seeking help were doing so as a direct result of having benefit payments delayed, reduced or withdrawn.

Other factors behind the increase on those using emergency help - the 'hidden hungry' - include rising food prices, unemployment and energy costs.

But Energy Secretary Ed Davey told MPs that it was 'completely wrong to suggest that there is some sort of statistical link between the benefit reforms we're making and the provision of food banks'.
