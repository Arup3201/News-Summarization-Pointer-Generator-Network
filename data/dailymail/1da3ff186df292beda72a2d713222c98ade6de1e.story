Comedian Dave Hughes has followed up his train-commute reading of Jane Austen's Pride And Prejudice with a new expletive-filled children's book. 

Hughes, who has followed in the footsteps of Breaking Bad actor Bryan Cranston, has narrated an Australian version of the book You Have To F***ing Eat by American author Adam Mansbach.

The tongue-in-cheek book, which is peppered with profanities, is a sequel to the largely successful Go The F*** To Sleep described as a 'children's book for adults'.

Actor Bryan Cranston narrated the same book for Amazon's US version and it has since gone viral. 

Earlier this month, Hughes treated commuters on a busy morning train to a 'bogan' reading of the classic Pride And Prejudice. 

Footage shows the comedian holding the book up while standing in between others passengers, before breaking out into narration in his thick Australian accent.
