A daring 
Swiss pilot has completed his latest dramatic stunt by flying with just a
 jet-propelled wing alongside two planes over the Swiss Alps.

Yves
 Rossy, also known as 'Jetman', took to the skies for the latest 
remarkable solo flight where he flanked two L-39C Albatros planes.

The 52-year-old became the first man in history to fly with a jet-propelled wing in November 2006.

Daredevil: Jetman, who has previously flown over the Grand Canyon and English Channel, completed his latest stunt in his custom-built jet suit

His most recent daredevil feat saw him fly in formation with the two planes over the famous mountain range.

'Jetman' Rossy flew fighter jets for the Swiss air force for 17 years.

His
 custom built flight suit weighs almost 55kg, has a wing span of two 
metres and four engines, and can exceed speeds of 200km/h.

He has also previously soared over the Grand Canyon for eight minutes, and over the English Channel, in 13 minutes.

Previously Jetman has flown his jet suit across Lake Geneva in 2002 and the English Channel in 2008.

His U.S. flight had taken two years to plan but was held up at the last minute because the final Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval had 
been given just 30 minutes before he was due to take off on Friday.

This meant that Rosy had had no time to 
practice. That may have been OK if the flight have been over water, but 
with the Grand Canyon's snagged edges and jutting out rocks one wrong 
move could have proved fatal.

'I was not ready. It would be unsafe and
 disrespectful to my team and everybody here to present something not 
well prepared,' Rossy said.

He also had to cancel his first attempt at flying over the English Channel because of bad weather.
