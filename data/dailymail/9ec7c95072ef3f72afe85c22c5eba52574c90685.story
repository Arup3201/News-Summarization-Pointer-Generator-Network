A former Masterchef contestant is giving new meaning to home cooking - opening her first restaurant just metres away from her back door.

Kathryn Minchew, who made it to the semi-finals of the hit BBC show in 2008, is launching the intimate dining experience in a small wooden hut at the foot of her garden. 

The Studio, which is built around a single hexagonal table, can fit just six diners, who sit across from each other on wooden benches that are covered in reindeer hide. Their three-course meals is eaten off wooden plates.

Intimate: The restaurant can fit just six guests who all sit across from each at an unusual hexagonal table that is built around a central log fire

Unassuming: The wooden shed, pictured, at the foot of Ms Minchew's garden in Gloucester makes an unlikely location for her first restaurant

And Ms Minchew promises to cook at least one part of the £35 set menu  in front of her diners.

But if the rustic setting does not appeal the chef is also opening a second restaurant - in her dining room. 

Her business venture was inspired by a recent trip to Barcelona, where she visited Tast-Ller, located in an apartment. The unassuming front door gives no clue to chef Mikel Rivas Nuria Peinador's tasting menu, and sparked Kathryn's idea for her new venue.

Ms Minchew said: 'Tast-Ller was fantastic. The secrecy of it made it exciting and actually not having to make a decision on the food or wine was incredibly refreshing. You get what he's cooking and I loved that.

'I already had a Kota hut, which originate in Finland, in the garden and I was looking at that and thinking I had a ready-made restaurant there.'

She is keeping the exact location of The Studio under wraps to add to the anticipation, but revealed it was about a mile from Gloucester Quays shopping centre.

Next venue: Ms Minchew, 38, wants to offer guests a more spacious dining experience when she opens her next restaurant in her living room

Ms Minchew made it to the penultimate round of Masterchef in 2008 but said she never had a desire to work 'in someone else's restaurant'.

The Studio, an octagonal hut, sees diners sit around a crackling fire and Kathryn has promised at least one element of the meal will be cooked in front of their eyes.

'I'm a copywriter for a living and I've been running workshops in the hut but what I found was people were here all day and wanting some food,' said Kathryn, who has two stepchildren and a son with her husband.

'I spoke to the council and met all the regulations to be catering here so I already had all of that in place to make it more of a real restaurant.' 

Roaring fire: Reindeer hides add a touch of comfort to wooden benches that line the walls of the hut, while open flames warm the room

Sample menu: Guests can enjoy a mug of mead followed butternut squash and Chinese mushroom soup with aubergine crisps as a starter

A sample three-course menu, set at £35 per person, will feature a mug of mead to start, followed by butternut squash and Chinese mushroom soup with aubergine crisps. The main course will be a beef bourguignon served with fire-baked potatoes and petits pois a la Francaise.

A dessert of brandied fruits of the forest with brown sugar ice cream is followed by coffee.

Her dining room features five-courses, with a glass of champagne, cheese gougeres and a selection of cheeses with homemade crackers adding to the menu.

The Studio launches on November 28 and will open on alternate Friday nights.
