The second-in-command of a branch of Al Qaeda has been killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen, according to the terrorist group.

Said al-Shihri rose to become number two of the Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) following his 2007 release from Guantanamo Bay prison.

This is the fourth time the Saudi-born Al Qaeda official has been reported dead.

Al-Shihri was eulogised in a video by a
 senior AQAP official, but no date was given for his death, U.S.-based monitoring 
group SITE said today.

‘I present my condolences to all the Mujahideen on the martyrdom of Said
 al-Shehri who was killed in a U.S. drone attack,’ Senior AQAP official Ibrahim al Rubaishsaid in the video.

In January, Yemen's official Saba news agency reported that al-Shihri died of wounds from a drone strike three months earlier.

In 2009 it was announced that he was killed by an American cruise missile and in September 2012, Yemeni news sites reported he was eliminated by a U.S. drone strike.

Al-Shihri, also known as Abu Sufyan al-Azdi, was handed to U.S. authorities by Pakistan in 2002 and was taken to Guantanamo Bay.

Despite his release in 2007, where he
 was returned to Saudi Arabia and later fled to Yemen to joing AQAP, 
U.S, officials has named him as one of the most important militants 
linked to the terrorist organisation ever to leave Guantanamo Bay.

Al-Shihri is reported to have been involved in the failed operation that targeted assassination of the Saudi interior minister, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef in 2009, as well as kidnapping of foreigners in Yemen and the 2008 embassy bombing.

The news of his death came as an official watchdog warned of the threat from the Yemeni-branch of Al Qaeda.

The independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC, reported that terrorism plots in Britain are becoming less complex and involve fewer participants, but highlighted the threat from Yemen.

‘We are certainly not seeing now what we saw in the years around 2005, 2006, which are the large, ambitious, 9/11-style plots perhaps to bring down simultaneously several airliners,’ he told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘However, Al Qaida has been diversifying or fragmenting - particularly in the Yemen.

‘Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula do still have good technicians and they have people who can make bombs. So we are not out of the woods,’ he said.

AQAP, which has planned attacks on international targets including airliners, has also been described by Washington, as perhaps Al Qaeda's most dangerous and innovative affiliate.
