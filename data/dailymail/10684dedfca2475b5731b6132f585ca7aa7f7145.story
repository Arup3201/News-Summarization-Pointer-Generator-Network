A suburban Toronto father is believed by police to have killed his two sons and committed suicide after their charred bodies were found last week in a burned-out car north of the city.

Samuel Masih, 36, was found last Friday near Barrie, Ontario, with sons Tyrese, 10, and four-year-old Santosh, after their mother filed a missing persons report when they failed to come home – marital problems are believed to be what drove the man over the edge.

Masih confided earlier this year with neighbors that he and and wife Brintha Shanmugalingam were headed for divorce, they told The Mississauga News.

‘He said it was going to be hard on the kids, but that he was hoping everything would be okay,’ a man identified only as Brandon told the paper.

The revelation came one week after police found the scorched vehicle at the end of a remote cul-de-sac about one hour north of Toronto.

Officers were shocked to find three bodies ‘charred beyond recognition’ inside the car, and it took an autopsy to identify the remains, according to reports.

The fire burned so intensely that it even melted the vehicle identification number, police told the Toronto Star.

‘Because of the burned-out nature of the vehicle, it’s virtually unidentifiable,’ said Ontario Provincial Police Sergeant Peter Leon. ‘It’s a metal shell.’

Memorial: Neighbors have been leaving flowers and letters of condolence for the widowed mother

Masih, a psychiatrist, initially told his wife that he and the two boys were going to see a movie around 4.00 p.m. the day before police found the vehicle. 

She called police when they failed to return by 1.30 a.m. early the next morning, police told the Star.The burning car was discovered only hours later.

‘This is a very, very tragic set of circumstances which has unfolded,’ Leon told the CBC.

Neighbors attending a July 9 vigil had a hard time coming to grips with the series of events that led to the grisly find.

‘The Dad just seemed like a normal guy, he’d pick kids up, drop them off, do the shopping,’ Neighbor Claudia Ah-Yen told the National Post. ‘It’s very hard to comprehend.’

Another neighbor who saw Masih hours before he died was unable to talk about the ordeal, saying only ‘I don’t want to talk about it right now.’

A friend of Tyrese Masih told the paper ‘he was nice,’ and went out of his way to make new students feel comfortable.

She left the dead fifth grader a note that read ‘you did not deserve this and you are a very sweet boy.’

The boy’s soccer coach called his death ‘shocking.’

Police have declined to comment further on whether marital troubles led Masih to the double murder-suicide, saying only that the family has been through a difficult number of days and reserves their right to privacy.
