A special selection committee has been put together to help find Ballmer's successor.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates will be on that board to help choose the new CEO.

'As a member of the succession planning committee, I'll work closely with the other members of the board to identify a great new CEO,' Gates said. 'We're fortunate to have Steve in his role until the new CEO assumes these duties.'

The committee at Microsoft plan to work with executive recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles to consider both internal and external candidates.

Ballmer is the second CEO in the history of the company. He took over the position from Bill Gates in 2000 and according to the Wall Street Journal, it was a rough transition.

While Ballmer got the new title, Gates still retained a lot of power. On one occasion Gates stormed out of a meeting after a shouting match with Ballmer.

Eventually Gates stepped back a bit and let Ballmer do his work.

'I had to change,' Gates said.

Before joining Microsoft in 1980, Ballmer worked for Procter & Gamble as a product manager for Coldsnap Freezer Dessert Maker.

He was hired at Microsoft as the company's 30th employee and became president in 1998.

He is the second person after former Coca-Cola CEO Roberto Goizueta to become a billionaire with stock options in a company he was not a founder of or a relative of a founder.

Ballmer is worth an estimated $15.2billion, according to Forbes. He married wife Connie Snyder in 1990 and they have three sons.
