A distraught father who lost two children in a tragic house fire that killed four members of the same family last night described his son and daughter as ‘the most amazing kids in the world’.

Steve Allen's son Bailey, four, and daughter Skye, two, died in the blaze last Friday night in Prestatyn, North Wales, which also killed his sister Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, and nephew Charlie, one.

Firefighters rescued Charlie and his father Liam Timbrell, 23, from their first floor flat in Maes Y Groes after the blaze, but the toddler died on Sunday. Mr Timbrell is in a critical but stable condition.

North Wales Police are continuing to 
appeal for information about the house fire - and two people arrested in
connection with the investigation into the fire have now been released.

A 42-year-old woman has 
been bailed and told to return to a police station in the near future, 
pending further inquiries. Meanwhile, a 45-year-old man has been released 
without charge.

Mr Allen and his fiancee Jonty Lewis said they were ‘devastated’ by losing two of their four children.

‘They
were our world,’ Mr Allen said in a statement issued by North Wales 
Police. ‘Bailey with his cheeky smile and Skye was just beautiful. They 
were the most amazing kids in the world.

‘Their
smiles used to light up our day. They were such little stars. They were
always so happy, they were a joy and loved everything about life.’

Bailey had recently started the nursery at Bodnant Community Infants School, while Skye attended the playgroup there.

‘He loved to race me to the school gate,’ said Mr Allen, who has lived in Prestatyn for 16 years.

‘Bailey loved Scooby Doo, Moshi 
Monsters and his building bricks, and Skye was a girly girl who loved 
dollies, nail varnish and particularly her wellies which she wore all 
the time.

‘We are a very 
close family, who always do stuff together. My sister doted on the 
children.

'She was a fantastic auntie and mother to Charlie and we know 
she would have done anything to save her “little kiddlets”, as she 
called them.

‘The children 
were all such little stars. We just hope that they are all together and 
that they all sleep well. We know their spirit is here, because 
everywhere we look they are here.’

He added: ‘The support we have received has been amazing. We want to thank everyone, specifically all the neighbours who tried to save all their lives - my sister and the kids.

'The children were all such little stars. We just hope that they are all together and that they all sleep well. We know their spirit is here, because everywhere we look they are here'

‘We know Liam tried to save them too. Everyone went above and beyond to help and we know this tragedy has broken everyone.’

A tribute released by the parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles of the four victims said: ‘Lee-Anna was a kind loving and caring person. She was bubbly and liked to be around her family and friends.

‘She would do anything to help who ever needed it. She loved her family and we all loved her very much. To the loveable grandchildren, Bailey, Skye and Charlie that made us smile when we saw them.

‘Skye was such a beautiful little girl, who would have grown into a wonderful woman like her mum. She loved painting her nails and wearing jewellery and being the perfect little princess that she was.

‘She always came to visit, she would like to sit on our lap and we would walk around the markets holding hands.

'Our memories will stay with us forever. We will all miss them so dearly. Sleep tight our angels'

Tribute by parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles of the four victims

‘Bailey gave cuddles and hugs. He had a smile on his face and looked so much like his daddy. No matter what he always brightened the room. He was a lively little boy who always wanted to play. He was our “cheeky monkey”.

‘Charlie loved to take cherries and grapes. He was a cheeky little chappie, only tiny, but bubbly. He was also a little rascal, who was loving like his mum. He was such an energetic baby - so lovable.

‘He made our day when he'd put his thumbs up to everyone and wouldn't quit until you did it back. He would come round and play with frog toy.

‘Our memories will stay with us forever. We will all miss them so dearly. Sleep tight our angels.’
