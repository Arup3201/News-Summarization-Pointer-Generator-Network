Loved: Arno Birdsong, 89, and his wife Myrtle, 88, Birdsong passed away just two days apart

A couple married for 71 years have been buried side-by-side after dying just two days apart.

Relatives said they believe Myrtle and Herbert 'Arno' Birdsong from Fort Meade, Florida died of broken hearts.

Mrs Birdsong, 88, died of heart failure on Sunday February 23, two days before her 89-year-old husband passed away from heart failure as he battled cancer in hospital.

'They did tell him that she had died and there was a tear that came out,' their daughter, Melanie Justice told Bay News 9. 'I truly believe they both did die from broken hearts.'

The couple, who married in 1943 and 
had three children, were remembered by a standing-room-only congregation
 on Saturday morning at the First Church of God in Fort Meade.

More
 than 100 mourners, including the couple's grandchildren, shared 
memories of the couple, who were stalwarts of their church and 
community, the Ledger of Lakeland reported.

'Arno could say a lot with a little,' 
said the Rev. Randall Belcher, who led the service, the Ledger reported.
 'Myrtle could say a lot with a lot.'

The couple married as soon as Myrtle finished high school in 1943, according to their obituary.

Arno

 Birdsong, who served in World War II, owned and ran B&B Electronics
 in Fort Meade and also worked as an assistant chief of the
 city's volunteer fire department.

Never apart: The couple, pictured with one of their grandchildren, were separated in their last days as Arno battled cancer in hospital. Relatives said he shed a tear when he learned his wife had died

Friends remembered Mr Birdsong, who was also a member of the Fort Meade Lions Club and Chamber of Commerce, as a capable man.

'If he had been a doctor, he would have 
been a perfect one,' said Abiola Adeyemo, who leased property from Birdsong. 'If he had been a pastor, he would have been a 
perfect one.'

Myrtle Birdsong worked 
with the Polk County Tax Assessor's office for nearly 10 years and 
assisted her husband in their family business, according to the obituary.

She
 also served as the First Church of God's Sunday school teacher and 
choir director for more than 25 years - helping out 'in any area of the 
church that needed her attention'.

Strong: The couple married in 1943 when Myrtle left high school and stayed in Fort Meade, Florida, where they raised two daughters and a son, and were involved in the community and church

'Mrs Birdsong shared her wonderful talent of singing throughout her 
community for many years singing for countless funerals and weddings,' the obituary reads.

'She was an accomplished vocalist, artist, and loved quilting.'

'She always had her mind on someone else,' her granddaughter Sherri Hanson said at the funeral. 'And then, when she would pray, she would ask God to help her be more giving. Even with all she gave, she wanted to give more.'

The couple had two daughters and a son and are also survived by five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
