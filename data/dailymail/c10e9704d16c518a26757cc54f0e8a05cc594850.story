Police in Miami are hunting for a man and woman who stole more than $700 worth of alcohol from a store by slipping bottles under their clothing.

CCTV footage shows the two unidentified suspects at Grove Liquors on Friday August 22 wandering down aisles and sneakily thieving products from the shelves.

The lady is seen putting a large bottle of Patron tequila under her dress at one point, while her male accomplice stuffs Grey Goose vodka down his pants.

Caught on camera: Police in Miami are hunting for a man and woman who stole more than $700 worth of alcohol from a store by slipping bottles under their clothing

Sneaky: The lady is seen putting a large bottle of Patron tequila under her dress at one point

Between them, they reportedly snatched a total of five bottles.

Miami Police Sgt. Freddie Cruz told CBS News that the duo took it in turns to distract employees as they raided the store.

'What they’re doing is actually asking the employee, as part of a distraction tactic, various questions,' he explained while watching the surveillance tape back.

'As she’s talking to one, the other one - the male - is actually stuffing his pants with two or three bottles of vodka.'

The male thief is described as a black man, in his mid-to-late thirties, around 5ft 9in and weighing 150lbs. 

His female partner in crime is described as black, between 30 to 35 years old, around 5ft 8in and weighing 220lbs.

Well-practiced: Police say they are concerned the duo might repeat the stunt

They both made a swift escape in a 1987 dark blue Oldsmobile 88 with Florida tag BFM-5108.

Police say they are concerned the duo might repeat the stunt.

'Judging from the way they have actually taken these bottles, this is not their first time, so they have gotten comfortable,' Sgt Cruz said.

He continued: 'They think they’re not going to get caught, so now we’re putting this video out we’re asking for the community’s help.'

Anyone with information can call Crime Stoppers at (305) 471-TIPS.
