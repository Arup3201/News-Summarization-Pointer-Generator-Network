The widow of a man who died in New York City police custody after apparently being placed in a chokehold says he wasn't violent.

Esaw Garner said Saturday that her husband, Eric Garner, 'was a quiet man, but he's making a lot of noise now.'

Members of Garner's family spoke at the Harlem headquarters of the Rev. Al Sharpton.

A quiet man: Esaw Garner said her husband was a quiet man but that 'he's making a lot of noise now'

Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, said she wants justice for her son.

Garner died last week as he was being arrested on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes.

An amateur video shows a plainclothes officer placing Garner in what appears to be a chokehold. Garner gasped, 'I can't breathe!'

Autopsy results are pending further testing.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder says the Justice Department is 'closely monitoring' the investigation into Garner's death.

Victim:
 Eric Garner, 43, died after being held in a 'chokehold' by NYPD officer
 Daniel Pantaleo in Staten Island. An initial report into his death has 
said he was 'not in great distress

NYPD 
Commissioner Bill Bratton has since ordered all of the city's 35,000 officers 
to be retrained in how they use force following the death.

Bratton
 said Garner's death was 'very tragic' and ordered Deputy Commissioner 
of Training Benjamin Tucker to conduct a 'top-to-bottom' review of 
officers' training. 

The
 commissioner, who met with FBI officials following Garner's death, said
 he anticipated a civil suit by the family and 'would not be surprised 
if the U.S. attorney 'decides to open a civil rights violation 
investigation.'

An
 initial report into Garner's death released earlier this week did not 
mention a chokehold, claiming he 'was not in great distress' and his 
health 'did not  get worse' as he was held down.

The
 omission has sparked an angry reaction from City Hall, with state 
senator Bill Perkins shouting: 'This is murder' during a rally. 

In the video of Garner's death, veteran officer Pantaleo waved to the camera as the father was taken away on a stretcher.

One of the witnesses asked, 'Why is nobody doing CPR?' an officer responded, 'Because he's breathing.'

 action: NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, pictured left with New York 
Mayor Bill de Blasio during a press conference this week, wants a 
'top-to-bottom' review of how officers use force

Sergeant Dhanan Saminath said Garner was in handcuffs with officers 'maintaining control of him' according to the report.

It also suggests that he 'resisted arrest' and failed to 'obey instructions' as police tried to handcuff him. 

However Sergeant Kizzy Adonis said she 'believed she heard the perpetrator state that he was having difficulty breathing'. 

The
 New York City Medical Examiner's office has not yet been able to 
determine what killed Garner - whether he died from a chokehold or an 
underlying health issue. 

Pantaleo,
 a plainclothes cop, has been forced to surrender his gun and badge and 
put on desk duty while the NYPD investigates the case.

Treatment: A witness asked why no one was giving him CPR, to which officers respond 'because he is breathing'  

It has also 
been revealed that he has seven civil rights lawsuit against him - 
including allegations of illegal strip searches and arresting men who 
were 'committing no crimes' at the time.

One
 resulted in the city paying $30,000 to two men who were unlawfully 
strip-searched. The other lawsuit, which is still pending, alleges an 
unlawful arrest. 

Garner's
 grieving son, meanwhile, has called for the New York Police Department 
officer who was filmed putting his father in a chokehold to be arrested 
and thrown in jail. 

This
 isn't the first time Pantaleo has been accused of abusing his police 
powers, the Staten Island Advance reports. The eight-year veteran 
officer has had two civil rights lawsuits filed against him.

The
 first was the result of a March 2012 traffic stop in which Darren 
Collins and Tommy Rice were arrested and then strip-searched in broad 
daylight on a Staten Island street. 

Gwen, Mr Garner's mother, said she was glad the incident was recorded so police could not shy away from what happened. 

Devastated:
 Mr Garner's mother, Gwen, said she is glad the incident was filmed so 
police could be held accountable for what happened
