Barcelona's international sporting director Ariedo Braida cannot understand why the Catalan club sold Alexis Sanchez to Arsenal as he is one of the best players in the Premier League.

Braida, one of the men who will be part of the sporting board Barcelona are in the process of building, rues the sale after seeing Sanchez shine at the Emirates Stadium with 18 goals in 32 matches for Arsene Wenger's side this season.

Speaking to El Mercurio, Braida said: 'I'd like Sanchez at all my clubs.'

Sanchez was sorely missed by Arsene Wenger's side as they narrowly lost 2-1 to Tottenham on Saturday

Asked why the club would sell Sanchez after scoring 19 goals in La Liga last season, Braida said: 'That I do not know. I was not at the club at that time and I can not put myself in that situation. 

'I only started my position this month. I do not know what reasons the club had to let him go, but now Sanchez is one of the best in the Premier League and is at a top level in world football.

'Alexis Sanchez is a great player, one of the world's best in his position. I know him a lot, he has an exquisite technique.'

Braida revealed that he came close to bringing Sanchez to the San Siro during his time as sporting director at AC Milan.

He said: 'Alexis Sanchez could be one of my players and who knows may be in the future can be, you never know. 

'Five years ago, when the Chilean played at Udinese and started to be a star we had conversations to bring him to Milan but we couldn't get it done.' 

Sanchez returns to Wenger's squad for the match against Leicester on Tuesday evening after missing the north London derby with a hamstring strain.
