Whether it’s a quick dip before breakfast or a cheeky stroll along the red-light district, these tiny holidaymakers are making the most of the hot weather.

And although David Gilliver’s little people are only 2cm tall, the world is their oyster in his latest collection of work.

Gilliver, a Guernsey-based finance worker, spends hours scouring the internet for the miniature figurines, before setting up the surreal scenarios.

Sweet seduction: In 'Amsterdam' artist David Gilliver uses Starburst sweets to recreate the infamous red-light district

And although the figurines are usually used on model railway sets, Gilliver has far more interesting jobs for the little people.

His latest pictures show them in situations such as playing golf with hundreds and thousands and watering the gigantic bluebells.

But it’s not all fun and games - for these little chaps, tending to a 5 square metre garden is a mammoth task.

The 34-year-old said: 'I shot the latest set of photographs over the past couple of months and so I have been able to utilise things like Daffodils and Bluebells in some of the work.

Go Figure! 'Match.com' is one of artist David Gilliver's pieces using 2cm-tall figurines, which he trawls the internet to find

'It’s nice to keep some of the work relevant to when it was made.

'My wife and I visited Amsterdam back in April and the infamous red light district was just begging to be recreated using an amusing diorama.

'In this instance Starbursts act as the platforms from which the ladies try to entice their male spectators.'

Each scenario takes Gilliver around 90 minutes to set up and photograph.

He started creating the miniature dioramas over 10 years ago during his Fine Art Photography degree at the Glasgow School of Art.

He said, 'Miniature figurines have always fascinated me and I take a lot of enjoyment from thinking up new ideas about how I can use them next.

'I always joke with people, saying that I obtained my degree by playing with toys, which on the face of it, is difficult to argue against.

'I am a very keen landscape photographer, and I think my initial interest was born out of an effort to find a completely different style of photography to interest myself in.'

Although renowned for its humour, Gilliver’s latest body of work has taken a more sinister turn.

Most notable is the blood-splashed murder scene inspired by the dark TV series ‘Dexter’.

Gilliver said, 'My wife and I were massive fans of the TV series Dexter, and when it finished for good I decided to dedicate one of my miniature set-ups to the show we loved.

'Maybe the murderer in my mini-series could be called "The Sewing Kit Killer"?'

Murder scenes aside, Gilliver hopes that the little people would be happy in their roles. He said, 'Hopefully they would thank me for allowing them to fulfill their potential in the various scenarios they find themselves placed in.'

But adds, 'Or maybe they would tell me to stop being so silly.'
