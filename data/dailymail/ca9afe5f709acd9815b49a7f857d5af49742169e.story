Reigning Miss Texas has claimed a new crown - for throwing the worst ceremonial first pitch ever.

Monique Evan's underhand effort before the Rangers-Angels game in Texas on Friday made 50 Cent and Chrissy Teigen's throws look good.

Sporting a tiara and short-shorts, the 22-year-old attempted a softball-style pitch but released the ball too early.

The ball soared through the air (briefly) before crashing to the ground about a foot away from her and rolling in the general direction of the home plate.

As the Texas catcher stared in disbelief at the rolling ball, Evans - a professionally-trained dancer - laughed and clapped her hands.

The Texas beauty should get points for nailing the dismount, striking a ballerina pose with both arms over her head.

The University of Texas student later thanked her fans and sponsors on Instagram for an 'incredible experience'.Â
