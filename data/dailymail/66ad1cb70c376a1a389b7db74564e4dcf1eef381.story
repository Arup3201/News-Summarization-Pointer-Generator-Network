Attacks on guide dogs by out-of-control dogs have reached an all-time high, a charity has today warned.

More than ten attacks on animals helping blind and partially-sighted people are being reported every month, the 
charity Guide Dogs said in a report published today. It is an increase of eight per 
month at this time last year and is believed to be down to an increase in the number of abandoned dogs.

A total of 240 dog attacks on guide dogs were reported between March 2011 and February this year, the report by the charity said.

Five guide dogs had to be withdrawn from service during the period, costing the charity more than £170,000.

It comes as MPs prepare to discuss the 
Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill - which includes 
legislation that would make it an offence for your animal to attack a 
guide dog.

The number of reported attacks has risen since its last report in 2012, which showed an average of eight attacks a month.

A teenager’s beloved guide dog was mauled outside a park while her four-year-old niece looked on in horror.

Jayne Massey, 14, has only been paired with Black Lab/retriever cross Witney since April this year and is one of the youngest people in the country to benefit from a guide dog.

While she was at a school holiday activity day, Jayne’s parents Marie and George, and her four-year-old niece Ava, took Witney for a walk in Walton Hall Park, Liverpool. As they left the park after the walk, a dog suddenly ran over to them and pounced on Witney, attacking her face and throat.

Marie said: 'There was a group of people with this dog who were just stood there arguing amongst themselves. The dog was wandering up and down with its lead in its mouth and then all of a sudden it saw Witney and went for her. It took both me and George of us to pull it off her and Ava was looking on screaming and terrified.'

Kirsten Barrett’s guide dog Norman had to be retired
following a vicious street attack by two dogs.

She was walking her seven year-old daughter to school in
Bridgend, South Wales, when Norman was set upon by two dogs, a Staffordshire
bull terrier and a rottweiler.  Police
believe the attacking dogs had been abandoned.

Norman, an eight-year-old Labrador, had to undergo emergency
surgery after the attack. He lost part of his left ear and a lot of blood in
the attack. He has made a good physical recovery, but is no longer able to work
as a guide dog.

Mother of two Ms Barret, 41, said: 'The attack was terrifying. I
told my daughter to carry on walking away, so she didn't get hurt, while I
tried to get in between the dogs.

'But they were too strong, and I got bitten on
the hand and leg as well. Eventually, I managed to get Norman into a
neighbour's house, but even then this dog was flying at the glass trying to get
at him.

'I'm still angry and frightened and my daughter's still too terrified
to talk about the attack. Norman has been my loyal guide dog for seven years
and I’m devastated that he’s had to be retired early, it’s a huge blow.'

Kevin Nugent's guide dog, Orlando, was also attacked, leaving him with horrific injuries to his backside.

The dog clamped onto Orlando's back with its jaws and would not let go. Orlando's collar came off and he was dragged into the nearby car park.

Mr Nugent said: 'The other dog was on a lead but the owner had no control of it. A couple of times the other dog had Orlando in the air and was shaking him around like a doll.

'I was screaming at the top of my voice 'get this dog off!' Eventually, we got the dog off. Orlando fell to the floor I started shouting out for someone to call the police.'

dogs were reported between March 2011 and February this year, the report
by the charity said.

It comes as MPs prepare to discuss the 
Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill - which includes 
legislation that would make it an offence for your animal to attack a 
guide dog.

The number of reported attacks has risen since its last report in 2012, which showed an average of eight attacks a month.

Police have told Kevin that as the dog was not a banned breed, and because it attacked another dog rather than a person, there was nothing they could do and that the case has been closed.

MPs will today give a second reading to the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, which would amend the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.

As well as outlawing attacks on assistance dogs, it would also allow prosecution of the owners of dogs which attack people on private property.

Guide Dogs chief executive Richard 
Leaman said: 'A change in the law can't come quickly enough for our 
guide dog owners, who too often have to bear the devastating 
consequences of these attacks.

'When a guide dog is attacked, someone with sight loss can completely lose their means of getting out and about independently.

'The impact on their life is huge and
we are calling on the Government to do everything in its power to 
promote responsible dog ownership, deter these attacks, and ensure this 
deeply worrying trend does not continue.'

Mr Leaman added:  'We have fought 
long and hard on this issue and while we are delighted these measures 
are being proposed, there is no time to lose. Only when irresponsible 
owners are held accountable for their dogs, and heavily punished for 
their aggression, do we believe the number of attacks on guide dogs will
come down.'

A Defra spokeswoman said: 'Attacks on guide dogs can devastate owners and rob them of their independence.

Gold retriever Faith was also savagely attacked. More than ten attacks on animals helping blind and partially-sighted people are being reported every month, the charity Guide Dogs said in a report published today

'That is why we are changing dangerous dog law to make it explicit that the owner of a dog that attacks a guide dog can be prosecuted.

'We expect this to become law in spring next year.'

Animal welfare minister Lord de Mauley last week met the parents of a teenage girl mauled to death by a pack of dogs, who urged the Government to tighten the laws around dangerous animal ownership.

Shirley and Michael Anderson, the mother and stepfather of 14-year-old Jade Lomas Anderson - who died after being attacked in March, said the law should be toughened 'to prevent what we are going through from happening to other people.'
