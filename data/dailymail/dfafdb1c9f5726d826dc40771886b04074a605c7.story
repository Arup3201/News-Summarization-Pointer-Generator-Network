Pantilimon told the Sunderland Echo: 'At this moment, I think everyone is fighting for their position. There's a long period until we start the Premier League.

'It's normal for everyone to work hard, train hard and after that, we'll see what happens. I think everyone wants to be in the first XI. We'll see.

'Vito is a good guy and a good keeper. I know that. But whatever happens, it's important that it helps the team.

'It's not just competition for us, it's everyone in the team. At this moment, no-one is in the starting XI.'ends
