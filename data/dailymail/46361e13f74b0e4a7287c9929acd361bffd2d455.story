Ronnie Moore has been confirmed as manager of the Football League’s bottom club Hartlepool United, eight months after he was sacked by Tranmere Rovers for a breach of betting rules.

Sportsmail revealed last week that the 61-year-old was set for a return to the dugout at Victoria Park.

And, on the same day the club confirmed that TMH 2014 had completed their takeover from Norwegian owners IOR, they unveiled Moore as the new boss.

Moore broke the rules after placing 95 bets via a family member’s account, including a £1 stake on Tranmere

New chairman Peter Harris said: 'We believe that having Ronnie in charge will give the club the best possible chance of remaining in the Football League and we will provide him with all the support he needs to help him achieve that.

‘He is a very experienced manager which is something we felt was needed but he’s also a tough character who is very much prepared for the battle ahead.’

Moore was fired by Tranmere in April after he admitted an FA charge relating to betting on competitions and matches in which his club was involved.

He broke the rules after placing bets via a family member’s account, including a £1 stake on Tranmere to win in a double with Manchester United, which returned £3.93.

The final straw for Hartlepool's hierarchy came when non-League Blyth Spartans beat them in the FA Cup

Following his dismissal, Moore said: ‘The only thing I’m guilty of really is I’m embarrassed because as a manager of Tranmere Rovers I should have known (the rules) – so I hold my hands up, it was my fault.’

Speaking at the time, his solicitor, Steve Smith, added: ‘The prosecution accepted there were no integrity issues against him.’

Moore was fined £2,000 and given a one-month suspension, suspended for two years.

His new club, meanwhile, are six points from safety at the bottom of League Two and have not won in the league for two months.

He replaces Paul Murray – sacked after just seven games – and will be assisted by current caretaker Sam Collins.
