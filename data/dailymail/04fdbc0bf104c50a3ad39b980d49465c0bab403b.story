With a luxury childrenswear market thought to be worth £500 million in the UK alone and the likes of Romeo Beckham already making a foray into the world of fashion, it was only a matter of time before the kids got their own fashion week.

And now childrenswear website AlexandAlexa has announced the first ever Global 
Kids’ Fashion Week (GKFW) launching in London this spring.

GKFW will cast a spotlight on premium kids’ fashion, from both established designers and emerging names and proceeds from all ticket sales for the public fashion show will be donated to Kids Company, the charity partner for GKFW.

people about Kids’ fashion – celebrating how this specialist category 
has thrived and evolved over the past five years.

'I'm
delighted to be involved in Global Kids Fashion Week. It's a great 
initiative which celebrates designer children's wear on a global 
platform,' said Sarah Curran, Founder my-wardrobe.com.

The news stars? Will fashion fans Harper Seven and Romeo be walking the catwalk?

Alex Theophanous, founder and CEO of AlexandAlexa.com says: ‘Kids’ fashion is playful, fun and innovative – we all believe it deserves its own dedicated platform.

'This is why we are so proud to be supporting the very first Global Kids’ Fashion Week. With this event, we aim to put children’s fashion on the map worldwide’.

PETA – with the help of judges Sadie Frost and Meg Mathews – is recognising the best cruelty-free contributions to the fashion world in the first-ever PETA-Approved Vegan Fashion Awards.

Most Stylish Handbag:
Vivienne Westwood Derby Bag (£500)

The awards mark the launch of PETA's new logo, which designers and retailers can use to identify vegan clothes and accessories that they sell online or in stores.

'My two greatest passions are fashion and helping animals, so I was thrilled when PETA asked me to help judge their fashion awards' said Sadie Frost, the founder of popular fashion and lingerie line Frost French.

'It's phenomenal how many retailers and top designers are using pleather, micro-suede and faux cashmere in their collections, and the quality is amazing.

'The new fabrics are kinder not only to animals but also to the environment.

'So with ethical consumerism on the rise – and its increasing importance to young people – retailers need to respond by using compassionately produced materials if they don't want to be left behind.'

The winners include Vivienne Westwood for Most Stylish Handbag, Ted Baker for Most Stylish Men's Bag, Stella McCartney for Most Stylish Women's Shoes and H&M for Most Stylish Men's Shoes.

Other retailers to take home prizes include Topshop, New Look, AllSaints and Burton. Bo Carter – known for her bright, playful designs and her refusal to use fur or leather – picked up the award for Most Talented New Designer.
