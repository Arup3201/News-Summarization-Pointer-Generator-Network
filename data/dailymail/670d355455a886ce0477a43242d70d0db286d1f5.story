Indiana Jones: Raiders Of The Lost Ark tops list of most re-watched films followed by Star Wars, both of which star Harrison Ford

Movie lovers typically rewatch their favourite film 29 times in their lifetime, according to research released today.

Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark tops the list of our most regularly re-watched films, followed closely by sci-fi classic Star Wars and Back to the Future.

The study reveals 72 per cent enjoy revisiting their favourite films with 63 per cent noticing new things with each viewing.

Another 48 per cent say rewatching movies cheers them up, while 29 per cent rewatch favourites movies to introduce a loved one to them.

But modern day distractions such as buzzing smartphones and social media also cause us to forget film plots and misunderstand complicated movies.

Around 65 per cent of Brits forget film plots after watching them once with 24 per cent admitting it takes a mere 24 hours to do so.

And technology seems to be the problem with mobile multi-tasking, checking emails and social media  topping the list of distractions.

Our loved ones are also guilty of causing us to lose the plot.

Chattering partners asking questions about the film is a top frustration, stopping 39 per cent of viewers from concentrating properly. 

This may be the reason that 35 per cent of Brits admit fibbing when they’re asked if they understand a complicated film.

Over half  of the 1,000 UK adults surveyed also admit regularly turning to sites like IMDB or Wikipedia to unravel complicated storylines.

Psychologist Dr Dimitrios Tsivrikos from University College London said: 'With so much modern technology to distract us, it seems that when it comes to watching a film, we struggle to switch off and concentrate.

Back To The Future comes in third as viewers reveal technology, including smartphones and social meida, are the most distracting things while trying to watch a film

'There is only so much detail and drama the human brain can handle in one sitting, meaning attention levels will dip during the duration of a film.

'We may need to re-watch it a number of times to fully understand and appreciate it.'

The research was commissioned by Sky Store Buy and Keep - a service which can download a HD movie to your TV to keep, allowing you to rewatch it time and time again.

Nicole Bamford, Director of Sky Store, said: 'As the research has uncovered, we’re a nation of avid film watchers who like to watch on repeat.'

2. Star Wars

3. Back to the Future

To help the nation enjoy films even more, Sky Store enlisted film expert Alex Zane to recommend how many times the UK’s most rewatchable films should be revisited.

Topping his list was Fight Club - which Alex recommends rewatching a staggering ten times for the ultimate viewing experience.

Alex said: 'I love re-watching films, whether it’s for a nostalgia hit, or to try to get my head around an intriguing or complicated plotline.

'I find you notice so many new and different things each time you watch films.

'My list says goodbye to the traditional star rating and hello to the re-watchability rating.

'It looks at how many times you should watch a film to truly grasp the plot, connect with characters, experience every emotion and laugh at every joke.

'It also helps you appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into making pieces of cinematic history.'
