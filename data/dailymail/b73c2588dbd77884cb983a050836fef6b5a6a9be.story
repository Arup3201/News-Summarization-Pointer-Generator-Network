A New Zealand bar manager and two Myanmar men pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges of insulting religion, which carries a penalty of up to two years in prison.

Philip Blackwood, general manager of the V Gastro Bar in Myanmar's biggest city Yangon, was arrested last week for advertising the bar with a poster featuring a pink Buddha wearing headphones 

The advertisement was removed and an apology posted, but Blackwood and his two colleagues, were arrested.

About 90 percent of Myanmar's population are Buddhist and perceived insults to the religion are taken seriously. 

About 15 Buddhist monks, mostly from a nationalist organization, and more than 20 lay disciples were at the court as police brought in the three handcuffed defendants. 

Nearly 30 policemen were in attendance, thought to be due to the sensitive nature of the case.
