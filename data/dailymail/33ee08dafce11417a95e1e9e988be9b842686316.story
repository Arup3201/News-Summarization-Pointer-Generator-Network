Digital cameras have revolutionised photography, making photography cheap, easier and readily available to all.

However, one photographer has shunned modern equipment to use a 160-year-old method that requires a portable dark room and an enormous camera that   captures just one image every 15 minutes.

The collodion process - otherwise known as the wet plate process - was wildly popular from the 1850s to the 1880s. Invented by Frederick Scott Archer,   it was known for giving fine detail but also for being highly impractical.

Jonathan Keys, 41, from Newcastle, has been practicing the process for three years and says the results are highly satisfying.  'It's definitely far more rewarding than digital photography because of the time and attention needed for each picture,' he said.

Mr Keys will only take two to six photographs per day when using the wet plate process and reckons there are only around 50 people doing it in the UK.

While this style of photography may be completely baffling to most who simply press a button on their phone for instant snaps, Mr Keys takes a lot of   joy from it.

He said: 'The fun part of it for myself is the need to be near a darkroom to process each shot.  'It's similar to a polaroid, once it's been shot you can move onto the next shot without thinking about the time you have to spend in Photoshop.'

'In theory it's actually quicker because many working photographers will spend hours on Photoshop, however you do end up with less images.'

The process starts in the darkroom by pouring collodion onto one side of glass and then dipping it into silver nitrate, which makes it sensitive to   light.  While still under dark room conditions, the plate is then loaded into a camera and taken to Jonathan's desired location.

Jonathan will then take his lens cap off the camera to expose the plate to light and guess how long the cap needs to be off for to obtain correct   exposure.

The plate is then taken back to a dark room and developed in a similar way to conventional film negatives.  Unlike negatives and digital photos, the finished plate can be sealed with varnish to stop the silver oxidising and achieves a permanent record, as   proven by stills taken 150 years ago.

Mr Keys admits that he's often quizzed by curious members of the public about using such an unusual camera, including famous comedian Johnny Vegas.

The full-time photographer explains: 'I use a wooden 10x8 Circa camera from the 1880s so I get questions all the time, especially in Newcastle city   centre.

'I'm always with another person whilst shooting, that way one of us can concentrate on the process whilst the other answers the inquisitive public.'

Johnny Vegas was dumbfounded when I took the camera to book launch. He couldn't stop laughing and was expecting some flash powder!

'It's also a great way for making contacts as I've got a few photography jobs from a result of hanging around Newcastle with a big wooden box.'

Mr Keys, who is a self-employed photographer but does wet plate in his spare time, believes that the famous city is perfect for his art.

'The process suits subjects with lots of detail in such as the old ornate Edwardian doorways,' he said.

'There is plenty of scope but the only thing that stops you is the parking and those bus-only lanes.  'I'm planning on replacing the car with a mule and perhaps a cart at some future stage - though the wife may need some convincing.'
