Two underworld crime bosses were branded the 'merchants of death'  after being caught buying a military grade sub-machine gun for use in a vicious turf feud.

'Mr Bigs' Sohail Aurengzeb, 28, and Biny Amin, 45, were detained during a swoop by armed police after officers secretly trailed them as they completed an arms deal with another racketeering gang operating 100 miles away.

The pair paid up to £15,000 in cash for a Skorpian sub-machine gun - which fires 1,000 rounds of ammunition per minute and is used by the Czechoslovakian army -  to be used in a deadly drugs war they were fighting with rival gangs in Greater Manchester.

Police found the gun stuffed in a bag along with rounds of hollowpoint 'dum dum' bullets in the front passenger footwell of a VW Golf being used by one of their lackeys - or 'runners'.

They also arrested five suspects in Birmingham over the sale and trafficking of the firearm and seized two other firearms.

Aurengzeb was a convicted drug dealer who turned his terraced house in Oldham into a 'mini fortress' covering his windows with iron bars and installing CCTV cameras to check on unwelcome visitors.

Convicted gunman Amin was known as a 'driver' who was once a member of a motoring crime gang which in the 1990s used a modified Casio watch to unlock cars with central locking systems and disable their car alarms.

Today Aurengzeb was beginning a 15 year sentence after he admitted possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life and drug offences.

Amin, formerly of Longsight, Manchester was jailed for 14 years after being convicted by a jury of possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life.

After the case Det Insp Chris Mossop, from Greater Manchester Police, said he was sure the convictions had prevented someone 'being shot and probably killed'.

He said: 'The Skorpion machine gun is not a weapon carried for 'protection' or to be regarded as a 'status symbol.'

'The reality is plain and simple - it is designed for and was bought with the intention of maiming and killing.

'This case is just one of a number of recent and ongoing investigations into the most dangerous and prolific offenders on our streets and once again proves we are the thorn in the side of organised crime gangs.'

Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester was told both men struck a deal with gangsters operating in Birmingham to obtain the machine gun in August last year.

In 2009 Oldham had been in the grip of a gang war between groups from the town plus Bolton and Manchester which left three men dead and three others wounded.

Just days before the arms deal, three men were cleared of shooting dead one of the victims - a 21-year old shop worker who was gunned down outside a doctor's surgery in Oldham during a dispute over a cannabis farm.

On August 6 2011 Aurengzeb and Amin sent an accomplice ahead while they made their own way to a rendezvous with the Birmingham gang in a separate car.

Fearing they were being followed, the men tried to shake off any tails by completing a lap of the M60 orbital motorway and also slowing down at green traffic lights before speeding up when the lights turned red.

But officers kept track of the two cars and followed them to flats in Wednesbury in the West Midlands before allowing them to return to Manchester where they arrested occupants of both cars.

Police later found a giant drugs press used to package heroin at a property linked to Aurangzeb.

As a result of the double swoop, GMP shared intelligence on their investigation with West Midlands Police and five other suspects were held in Birmingham and a Russian made Baikal self loading pistol and Smith and Wesson revolver were seized.

A picture of the Skorpion machine gun was recovered from a mobile phone used by the Birmingham gangsters.

Det Chief Supt Darren Shenton, head of GMP's Serious Crime Division, said: 'We have taken out a firearms supply chain and recovered a number of deadly weapons in the process.

'This case proves that we will work with other police forces and will not hesitate to go beyond our geographical boundaries in order to bring serious organised criminals to justice.

'The sentences handed down reflect the threat posed by the defendants and the deadly weapons they traded and communities are safer with them behind bars.'

David Rouse from the West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service's Complex Casework Unit, said: 'These individuals were merchants of death and they had little disregard into the pain and suffering that these weapons and drugs can cause to people, families and to the local communities.

'This has been an important case for the criminal justice system as we want to demonstrate to the public that we will robustly prosecute those who seek to trade illegally in guns and drugs.

'It is vital in the light of the harm caused by illegal firearms, and to ensure that our communities feel safe, that such prosecutions are undertaken and dangerous weapons are taken off the streets. We have removed a significant threat to law and order.'

Ajaz Nazir, 33, of Oldham was found guilty of possessing a firearm and ammunition and was jailed for seven years at an earlier hearing.

Illyas Idrees, 27, of Wednesbury, West Midlands pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm and drugs supply and was jailed for five and a half years.

Imran Rashid, 32, of Denbigh Street, Birmingham and Imran Khan, 24, of Charles Road, Birmingham, were convicted of possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life and will be sentenced in February 2013.
