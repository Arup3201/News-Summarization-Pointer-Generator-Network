The Princess Royal has paid tribute to the men and women of the Special Operations Executive, the forerunner to MI6.

She joined veterans for a glittering gala dinner at London's Natural History Museum, part of which was used to train agents during the Second World War.

Resplendent in a floor-length ivory gown, Anne, who has spent the last week criss-crossing the UK on behalf of her charities, was on cheerful form as she arrived.

It was held to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the SOE, which sent agents into France and other occupied nations, among them Denmark and the Netherlands, during the war years.

Many of the recruits sent in were female, although tragically, of the 55 to join, 13 were killed in action or died in Nazi concentration camps.

One of the most famous was Violette Szabo, the daughter of an English father and French mother, who was just 23 when she was executed by the Nazis at Ravensbrück concentration camp.

Before she was captured and killed, however, she completed two operations in occupied France, arriving for the first on a flight from RAF Tempsford in Bedfordshire in a US B-24 Liberator bomber.

Important work: During World War II, hundreds of SOE agents were parachuted into occupied Europe

Although she returned home that time, she was less lucky and was captured by the Nazis while attempting to coordinate French Resistance efforts to aid the D-Day Landings.

On the 5th February 1945, as the Allied Armies closed in on Germany, she was executed with a single shot to the back of the head.

Her efforts, and those of many more SOE agents, were honoured during the event, which was conducted in the presence of a number of veterans, as well as the Princess Royal.

And she wasn't the only royal on hand to mark the efforts of the SOE. Also in London for the event was Norway's Crown Prince Haakon, who accompanied five Norwegian veterans.

Important: During the Second World War,  agents provided vital intelligence and helped sabotage the Nazis

The veterans, all of whom were part of the Norwegian Resistance as well as the SOE, had been taken to visit the Churchill War Rooms earlier that day.

Led by Joachim Rønneberg, who was behind their successful attack on the Vemork hydroelectric power plant in 1943, the men toured the museum before briefly taking a seat in Churchill's chair.

Their wartime efforts proved particularly useful, given that the plant they attacked produced heavy water - a substance needed for making nuclear weaponry.

Thanks to the five men, the Germans were never able to take over the plant - and the Nazis never got their hands on a nuclear bomb.
