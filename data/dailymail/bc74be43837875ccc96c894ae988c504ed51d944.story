Oxbridge students are used to coming top. And in a most recent league table, they don't disappoint.

Students at Cambridge University have been outed as those who spend more on sex toys than at any other university, according to new figures.

They topped a league table detailing sex spending at top colleges in the UK, while Oxford University came second.

It has lead to speculation that students with a high IQs may also have high sex drives.

'High achievers aim for excellence in all areas of their life - including sexual happiness'

Cambridge students spent almost 
£9,793 on sex toys and soft bondage in the last year - which works out 
at around 54p for each of the 18,000 students. Best selling products included rabbit vibrators and jiggle balls - popular for stimulating the G-spot.

Oxford students splashed out £9,689 on sex toys - or 46p for each of its 21,000 students. They favoured more exclusive toys than Cambridge - spending almost three times as much on luxury vibrators.

Manchester University lagged far behind our two elite universities in third place, spending just £5,441 in all on adult toys - almost half Cambridge’s total.

The figures were released by Britain’s biggest online sex toy retailer, Lovehoney.co.uk.

Cambridge students visited its site 5,995 times last year compared to 5,158 visits from Oxford and 3,905 from Manchester.

High levels of sex toy spending appear to show a heightened interest in sex amongst Russell Group students

The high levels of sex toy spending appear to show a heightened interest in sex amongst students in the Russell Group of elite universities - particularly Cambridge and Oxford.

All bar three of the top 10 spending colleges are in the Russell Group.

Five other Russell Group colleges made the top 20 - Nottingham (£2,811-12th ), Durham  (£2,451 - 15th), Bristol (£2,332 - 18th), Cardiff (£2,300 - 19th) and Exeter (£2,299 -20th) .

A study of 2,000 female twins by researchers from King’s College in London found that those with higher IQs tended to orgasm more.

Cambridge University graduate Alice Little, 27, who studied English at New Hall, said: 'It seems Oxbridge students know that sex and sex toys are the smartest way to relieve stress.

'Cambridge definitely has a work hard, play hard culture so it comes as no surprise Cambridge students spend the most to relieve the pressure of studying at a top university.

'High-achievers aim for excellence in all areas of their life, so it makes sense that achieving sexual happiness is one of their goals.'

Felix Hamer, studying at Keble College, Oxford, said: 'I think that intelligent people are more creative in the bedroom.'

An unnamed 19-year-old female student studying English at Oxford said: 'When I came to university in Oxford, I was struck by how open everybody was about sex.

'Oxford sometimes has a bit of a stuffy, old-fashioned reputation but in terms of sexuality it's very liberal.

'The added independence of a university lifestyle means that you can actually start to experiment with new things.

'Although some people are still hesitant to discuss sex toys, they know that in such a liberal and friendly environment there isn't a stigma attached to enjoying sex with a partner or just by yourself.'

Student spending on sex toys shot up following the publication of Fifty Shades Of Grey. It prompted thousands of students to experiment with sex toys and soft bondage, just as literature student Anastasia Steele does in the best-selling trilogy.

Lovehoney co-founder Neal Slateford said: 'We are delighted that dreaming spires aren't the only phallic objects getting everyone excited in Cambridge and Oxford!

'It is interesting that spending on sex toys is far high amongst students at our elite universities.

'It's no bad thing if brainier people are randier, but we tend to find that everyone in the UK has become far more interested and relaxed about sex - not just our friends at Oxford and Cambridge. '
