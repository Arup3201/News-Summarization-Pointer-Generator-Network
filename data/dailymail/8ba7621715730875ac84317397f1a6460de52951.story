Liverpool became only the third team to score more than 4,000 top flight goals at home on Tuesday night.

Brendan Rodgers' side took an early lead against Tottenham in the Premier League clash at Anfield when Hugo Lloris failed to keep out Lazar Markovic's scuffed effort after 15 minutes.

Liverpool's Merseyside rivals Everton have scored the most home goals in the top tier of English football with 4,208.

Aston Villa, who have notoriously struggled for goals in recent seasons, are the only other team to achieve the feat having bagged 4,025 home goals.

Liverpool's lead against Spurs didn't last long as Harry Kane continued his rich vein of form when he drew the visitors level after 26 minutes.

A victory Liverpool will see the club move to within just one point of top-four rivals Tottenham in the chase for Champions League football.
