A Utah baby who couldn't wait for his mother to get to hospital was born on the side of the rode with the help of a local sheriff on Sunday.

And the birth was caught on the officer's dash cam.

Britnie Dedrick, of Enterprise, went into labor early in the morning, but was 50 miles from the closest hospital in Cedar City.

Her husband, William Dedrick, packed her, their two children and Britnie's aunt into his truck and set off, hoping there was time, KSL reported.

But there wasn't.

Britnie's water broke in the car, and they knew the baby was coming straight away.

'I was scared,' William Dedrick told KSL.

Still 12 miles from the hospital, they pulled over and Britnie's aunt called 911.

Iron County Sheriff’s Deputy Tony Gower arrived at the scene, with his dash cam capturing the incident.

'I wasn’t exactly sure what I was going to need to grab other than a blanket and a couple other things,' Gower said.

'I started looking through my medical bag and realized I didn’t have time to worry about any of that. 

'I just need to get up and help her.'

'Miracle baby': Britnie Dedrick cradles her son Luke in hospital after the dramatic roadside birth

Grateful: After the incredibly fast labor and birth, Britnie said she's thankful everything worked out

Gower had never delivered a child before, which he didn't tell Britnie until both mother and child were safe in hospital.

The baby was born at 5.09am.

The Dedrick's named their guy Luke and refer to him as the 'miracle baby'.

He weighed in at 7 pounds and is 19 inches long.
