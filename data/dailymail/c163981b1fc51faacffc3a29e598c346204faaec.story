An artist has created beautiful and disturbing images of houses and other structures taken out of their usual environments and suspended in the sky.

Flying Houses, by French artist Laurent Chehere, is series of photographs depicting what it would actually be like if these homes decided to up and drift away, similar to Disney's movie Up.

As a photographer, Chehere has created work for the likes of Audi and Nike and employs traditional photography and digital manipulation.

Towering inferno: As well as evoking a sense of wonder, some of the images disturb, such as this picture of a house engulfed in flame

Happy campers: It's not just houses that the artist depicts. This work shows a caravan soaring among the clouds

Untethered: Chehere combines traditional photography and digital manipulation to create his images

Stairway to nowhere: Residents are stranded as the stairway lies tantalisingly close below  (left) while graffiti adorns this otherwise drab apartment building (right)

He said that he tapped into a place of childlike wonderment and drew inspiration from films like Howl’s Moving Castle and The Red Balloon.

The surreal images show new angles of these buildings and provides an insight into them that is hidden when rooted to the ground.

'Flying Houses' is on exhibition at Galerie Paris-Beijing in Paris from October 25 through December 4. Chéhère will also show work at this year's Art Miami Art Fair from December 4-9.

The ordinary made extraordinary: The artist took inspiration from films that produce a childlike sense of wonder

Urban: From high rises to caravans, Chehere releases the structures from their typical surroundings

Magical: Even tents are plucked out of the ground and sent soaring

Dangling: On closer inspection, many of the images have little quirks, like the crow on the roof (left) or dangling legs (right) in these scenes

Industry: This factory looks alien in the heavens, despite practical installations such as electrical and phone cables

For sale: it's difficult to imagine a prospective homeowners making an offer on this ethereal home
