British sports car maker Caterham has unveiled its first collection of motorbikes.

The iconic firm, which is a favourite of Simon Cowell, launched a rugged motorbike it is calling an SUV on two wheels, alongside a pair of electric bicycles.

The firm's aggressive-looking motorbike is named the Brutus 750, and will be going on sale early next year.

The Brutus 750 motorbike has chunky tyres and can be operated as a street bike, off-roader and even a snowmobile with slight modification, according to British sports car firm, Caterham

Engine: 750cc, single cylinderFuel delivery: Siemens fuel injectionFuel capacity: 10 litresTransmission: Continuous Variable Dimensions: 2150 x 800 x 1130 mm

The motorbike has chunky tyres and can be operated as a street bike, off-roader and even a snowmobile with slight modification.

The company said: 'The Brutus delivers the ultimate in flexibility and riding simplicity 
thanks to a 750cc single-cylinder engine that delivers its power through
 an automatic gearbox.'

It claims to be the first motorbike with automatic transmissions as well as the 'first ever two-wheel SUV'.

Caterham also unveiled two electric bicycles, which can be ridden on the road without a driving license, but so far there is no news about how fast each of the models might be able to go.

The design of the Classic E-Bike harks back to the golden age of British motorcycling, which according to the company stretched from the 1920s to the 1960s

FRAME: AluminiumBrakes:The front is a disk brake and the rear a roller brakeGears: Shimano Nexus 3 speedMotor: 36 volt, 250 wattBattery: Panasonic 36 volt 12AH lithium battery Dashboard: LED with battery status, speedo, trip meter and rangeDimensions: 210cm long, 69cm wide and 98cm tall

A spokesman for the company told 
MailOnline: 'The bikes are all still in prototype form and, as such, no 
performance testing has yet been conducted.'

The Classic E-Bike has a retro look and a range of up to 45 miles, while the Carbon E-Bike is inspired by Caterham’s F1 technology.

Both have dashboards with an LED screen displaying battery status, a speedo, trip meter and range.

It said: 'They had simple, elegant lines, curves filled with classic British 
racing colours detailed with pinstriping. The times were simpler and 
more carefree.'

It is the first part of this period that inspired the bike, which has a range of 40 to 80 km.

The model has an aluminium frame, leather handle grips and traditional springer front fork but also features modern technology, such as Shimano 3-speed hub gears for 'brisk acceleration'.

Designer Alessandro Tartarini calls the Classic E-Bike a 'fusion vehicle', in which 
old and new are brought together in the 'future of tradition'.

'This is a
 design in which classic styling and traditional materials meet modern 
design and materials,' the company said.

The Carbon E-Bike is described as a premium model and comes in a limited edition featuring Formula One materials.

It packs a 36-Volt, 250 Watt brushless motor, feeding its power through an 
eight-speed Shimano Nexus gear hub.

Caterham has professed the chassis 'a work of art' as it features a modular carbon-aluminium frame, in which three different frame sizes and
 flexible ergonomics technology means that the Carbon E-Bike can be adapted to fit the size and shape of a rider.

All three bikes, which were unveiled at this week’s Milan Bike Show in prototype form, are expected to cost a minimum of £8,500.

It is the latest expansion involving 
Caterham Group after it was bought in 2011 by Tony Fernandes, the Air 
Asia boss and owner of Queens Park Rangers.

Mr Fernandes said: 'Our vision for Caterham Group has taken another step forward with the launch of Caterham Bikes.

'Expanding
 our interests into the two-wheeled market is another natural 
progression for us and is a good opportunity to showcase the breadth of 
knowledge, experience and creativity we have at our disposal.'

The
 Malaysian millionaire has plucked Al-Ishsal Ishak from Air 
Asia to head up the operation, which will hopefully see the bikes 
manufactured in kit form in Leafield, Oxfordshire, before being assembled by 
distributors in their relevant country.

The
 bike arm joins the Caterham F1 Team, Caterham Racing (GP2), Caterham 
Technology & Innovation, Caterham Composites and the Caterham Moto 
Racing Team.

The British firm is best known for its classic racing cars, such as this Caterham Superlight, which is a two seater sports car (pictured)
