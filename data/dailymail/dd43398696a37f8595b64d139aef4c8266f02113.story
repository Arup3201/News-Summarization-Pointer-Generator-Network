Malia and Sasha Obama were the picture of charm and grace last night when they attended a charity Christmas concert on Sunday - in stark contrast to their demeanor at a Thanksgiving ceremony last month.

The 'First Daughters' joined their mother and father at the 33rd annual 'Christmas in Washington' concert on Sunday where they greeted a group of children dressed as elves.

Beaming from ear to ear, they laughed and joked with the six former patients of the Children's National Health System before presenting them with gifts including a basket of books. 

It comes a month after the sisters caused a national stir when they were pictured rolling their eyes and looking bored at the pardoning ceremony of the National Thanksgiving Turkey on November 26.

Taken: Barack and Michelle's eldest daughter, Malia, seemed particularly taken by the children 

Have you been a good President? Obama, his wife, Michelle, and daughters, Sasha and Malia, met six former patients of the Children's National Health System - a hospital for sick youngsters

Care for kids: The Children's National Health System is 140 years old and the 'premier provider of pediatric care in the region and the only freestanding children’s hospital between Philadelphia and Atlanta', says its website

After President Obama had pardoned four-month-old, 49-pound Cheese, he asked Malia if she wanted to pet the turkey, to which she sullenly replied, 'Nah'. 

As the photographs were beamed around the world, many observers slammed them for their behaviour, including GOP staffer Elizabeth Lauten who branded them 'classless' in an acerbic Facebook post. She was later forced to apologise for the attack.

But last night they were all smiles as they performed their duties alongside their parents at the fundraiser for sick children at the National Building Museum.

Before the concert, which included performances from Rita Ora and Earth, Wind and Fire, Obama, his wife, Michelle, and daughters, Sasha and Malia, laughed and joked with the kids and answered their questions, before presenting them with gifts - including a basket of books.

The six youngsters then posed for portraits with the first family.

'Fast and Furious' actor Dwayne Johnson, also known as 'The Rock,' hosted the concert and jokingly sang his own rendition of 'Deck the Halls.'

Other performers at the Christmas celebration included Christina Perri, Aloe Blacc and Earth, Wind and Fire. Obama bopped his head to Hunter Hayes' version of the Chuck Berry hit 'Run, Run Rudolph.' 

Books: After chatting to the children, the Obamas presented them with gifts, including a basket of children's books

Hugs: British singer Rita Ora was among performers at the event, and received a hug from first lady Michelle while meeting the Obamas at the end of the evening

Thanks: Following the carols, Obama reminded guests that 'Jesus lived a life of peace, love, kindness and forgiveness' and urged them to follow his example before thanking servicemembers for their sacrifices

Charming: They were all smiles at the National Christmas Tree lighting ceremony at the Ellipse near the White House in Washington last week too

Following the carols, Obama reminded guests of the reason for the holiday.

'Jesus lived a life of peace, love, kindness and forgiveness,' he said. 'During the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season, may we all do our best to follow his example.'

Obama also thanked servicemembers for their sacrifices.

The concert will be broadcast Friday evening on TNT.
