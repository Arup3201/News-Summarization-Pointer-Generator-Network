You may be unlikely to get a reply, but a US firm has revealed the first postal service to send items to the moon.

Astrobiotic hopes to fund the development of its lunar landing by offering to take items - with prices ranging from $460 to $26,000.

The firm, which has dubbed the service MoonMail, says it can even offer to give over entire missions for larger items that need more shipping space.

The project aims to put a lander of the lunar surface containing hundreds of capsules people have bought to send everything from rings to photos to the lunar surface.

The capsules purchased will be placed on this Griffin Lander, which is expected to blast off on top of a spaceX rocket in the next two years.

Each  MoonMail Kit that will consist of prepaid postage to mail items to Astrobotic, along with a map of the Moon Landing Site, a photo of the Moon Pod on the Moon, and a certificate of authenticity recognizing them as a Space Pioneer on the first commercial landing to the Moon.

The collected mementos will be placed inside the Moon Pod that will be attached to Astrobotic's lunar lander, which will remain on the Moon for future generations. 

'With MoonMail, people from around the world can send a memento on Astrobotic's lunar lander,' Astrobotic CEO John Thornton said.

'They'll make history by participating in the first commercial Moon landing.'

'With the starting price at $460, this exciting new offering from Astrobotic is an opportunity to commemorate major life events - graduations, weddings, birthdays, a loved one's memory - with a lasting symbol on the Moon,' it says.

Astrobotic is a Nasa contractor, and is also an official partner with NASA on the Lunar Catalyst program.

With its partner, Carnegie Mellon University, Astrobotic is pursuing the Google Lunar XPRIZE and is scheduled to launch the first mission within the next two years. 

It will launch on a SpaceX rocket.

After achieving low Earth orbit, the Falcon 9 second stage re-ignites for trans-lunar injection (TLI) to propel Astrobotic’s spacecraft into a 4.5-day cruise to the moon.

It consists of two spacecraft, a lander and the Polaris rover; lander and rover exist as a single spacecraft until touchdown on the lunar surface. 

The firm is now accepting orders for its capsules online. 

Each  MoonMail Kit that will consist of prepaid postage to mail items to Astrobotic, along with a map of the Moon Landing Site, a photo of the Moon Pod on the Moon, and a certificate of authenticity recognizing them as a Space Pioneer on the first commercial landing to the Moon.

Three basic sizes are offered, but can be customised, with prices ranging from $460 to $26,000.

Each buyer will be send a picture of their item onboard the craft before it flies

The capsules will be put into a sealed container and placed inside the lander.

The collected mementos will be placed inside the Moon Pod that will be attached to Astrobotic's lunar lander, which will remain on the Moon.. 

Astrobotic’s first mission will land near a pit in the Moon’s Lacus Mortis region and demonstrate unprecedented landing precision - if it goes according to plan.

Astrobotic’s landing technology registers high-quality, real-time camera images taken during the lander’s descent with terrain maps derived from orbital imagery to achieve safe landing at a precise destination. 

This capability enables Astrobotic’s Griffin lander to fly directly over the pit, capturing close-up views of the floor and walls that cannot be seen from orbit or the ground, and then to land within 100m of the pit. 

It will search for ice that could help future explorers set up a moon base - and is powered by solat panels that give it the appearance of having a mohawk. 

The firm says everything from photos to rings can be placed in the capsules.

Launch is by SpaceX Falcon 9.

After achieving low Earth orbit, the Falcon 9 second stage re-ignites for trans-lunar injection (TLI) to propel Astrobotic’s spacecraft into a 4.5-day cruise to the moon.

It consists of two spacecraft, a lander and the Polaris rover; lander and rover exist as a single spacecraft until touchdown on the lunar surface. 

Polaris is a robotic rover with a lunar drill, oven, and instruments for analyzing volatiles that will be delivered to the Moon's surface on Astrobotic’s lunar lander. 

The lander guides the spacecraft into lunar orbit and controls descent to the surface.

The lander delivers 262 kg of payload to any destination on the Moon to support robotic lunar missions like skylight exploration, sample return, regional prospecting, and polar volatile characterization.  

Polaris will have a drill capable of getting a metre under the lunar surface to look for sign of ice

Polaris prospects for water at the lunar poles. 

Polaris has vertical solar panels to generate 250W of power and two radiator panels to reject excess heat. 

Stereo cameras and laser are used to guide Polaris and generate 3-D video and models of the lunar surface. 

The robot communicates directly with Earth using a pointed S-band antenna to receive commands and send video and data. 

Polaris carries up to 80kg of payload, such as a drill to take core samples and science instruments to identify water content. 

Polaris is capable of driving and avoiding obstacles autonomously, including traverses into dark regions in the lunar pole’s long shadows. 

Polaris’ suspension maintains four-wheel ground contact over sloped and rocky lunar terrain without the use of springs.

The robot will explore for ten days until the 14-day cryogenic lunar night begins, then hibernate, recover at sunrise, and continue to explore. 

The lander and rover are both built to tolerate this cryogenic cold.

The life sized working prototype of the Polaris rover that could mine the moon in 2015

The Polaris rover is 5 ½ feet tall, 7 feet wide and
 almost 8 feet long.

It can move at about a foot a second on 
2-foot-diameter composite wheels.

Its suspension will enable the rover to rise up over rough 
terrain, but also lower itself to the ground to perform drilling.

The 
rover will weigh 150 kilograms, or about 330 pounds, and can accommodate
 a drill and science payload of up to 70 kilograms.

Polaris is a first of its kind solar-powered robot that will search for potentially rich deposits of water ice on the moon.

Observations
 by NASA and Indian spacecraft suggest that a substantial amount of 
water ice could exist at the lunar poles.

That ice could be a source of 
water, fuel and oxygen for future expeditions, researchers say.

Polaris
 can bore one meter into the lunar surface and 
can operate in lunar regions characterized by dark, long shadows and a 
sun that hugs the horizon.

It has been developed for an expedition to 
the moon's northern pole that would launch from Cape Canaveral on top of a 
SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle.

Polaris
 is a flight prototype but has the same configuration as the rover that 
will eventually land on the moon.

It includes a number of flight-worthy 
components, including wheels and chassis beams constructed of light, but
 tough composite materials.
  
  This
 will enable Astrobotic team members to spend the coming months testing 
and improving the robot's computer vision, navigation and planning 
software, and software that can plot the rover's position on the moon 
within 10 feet.

The Polaris rover will hunt for ice on the moon that can be mined to help set up moon bases for future explorers

Astrobotic — led by CMU's William 'Red' Whittaker — develops robotics technology for planetary missions.

'It is the
 first rover developed specifically for drilling lunar ice' said 
Whittaker.

Other robots built by the Field Robotics Center have
 developed technologies necessary for lunar drilling, but none of them 
were ever meant to leave Earth.

'What
 Polaris does is bring those many ideas together into a rover 
configuration that is capable of going to the moon to find ice,' 
Whittaker added.

To find 
the ice, a rover must operate as close to the dark poles as possible, 
but not so far that it can't use solar arrays for power, Whittaker said.

Polaris has three large solar arrays, arranged vertically to capture 
light from low on the horizon.

The solar arrays will be capable of an average of 250 watts of electrical power.

Polaris
 also makes use of software, pioneered in CMU's NASA-funded Hyperion 
robot, that keeps track of the rover's position relative to the sun's 
rays to maximize solar energy and husbands battery power for use in the 
long shadows and dark regions found at the poles.

Whittaker said the lunar day lasts about 14 Earth days, though only 
about 10 days are suitable for water prospecting at the poles.

The Astrobotic team expects Polaris 
could drill 10 to 100 holes during that time as it locates and 
characterizes water ice deposits.

Astrobotic, in partnership with CMU, is also vying for the Google Lunar X Prize of more than $20 million.

Polaris is one of two Moon rovers under development by Astrobotic in competition for the Google contest, which offers a total of $30m in awards to privately funded projects exploring the Moon.

First prize – $20m – will be awarded to the company that can 'safely land a robot on the surface of the Moon, have that robot travel 500 meters over the lunar surface, and send video, images and data back to the Earth.'

If Polaris successfully survives the long, frigid lunar nights, as anticipated, the prospecting mission could be extended indefinitely.

Astrobotic has won nine lunar contracts from NASA worth $3.6 million, including one to evaluate how Polaris can accommodate NASA's ice-prospecting instruments during a three-mile traverse near the moon's north pole.
