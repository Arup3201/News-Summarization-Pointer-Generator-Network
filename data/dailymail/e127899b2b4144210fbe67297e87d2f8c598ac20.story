The family of an elderly couple who were the victims of a horrific attack that left three others dead gathered Friday to deliver a brief but emotional statement asking for prayers as the pair remain on life support.

'We are heartbroken over this tragedy. The family is in complete 
shock,' said a niece who asked reporters not to reveal her name as she spoke in the Taylors' driveway.

She was surrounded by more than a dozen family members of the newly identified George and Ann Taylor, with many grasping each other's hands and clearly devastated.

The family of George and Ann Taylor gathered Friday for a brief but intensely emotional statement asking for prayers as the elderly couple remains on life support

A niece of the Taylors who asked not to be named said then family was devastated and confused by the vicious attack

'We cannot understand how such a 
heinous crime could happen to two such wonderful and kindhearted 
people,' she added, according to a report in the The Kansas City Star. 'We have cried 
many tears, but with each day we feel a little more strength to face an 
unknown future.'

The Taylors, both in their late 80s, were victims of the vicious attack that left three more 
killed in Kansas City on Tuesday.

Police
 in Kansas City on Wednesday identified Brandon Howell, 34, as a 
person of interest in the triple homicide following his arrest overnight
 in connection to a series of assaults at a local motel.

Saturday afternoon, Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker announced that 
Howell has been formally charged with three counts of first-degree 
murder.

The
 34-year-old ex-convict also faces three counts of armed criminal 
action, two counts of first-degree assault, burglary, motor vehicle 
theft and felon in possession of a firearm.

The other victims of the shootings were identified as Lorene Hurst, 88; her son, Darrel Hurst, 63; and Susan Choucroun, 69, all deceased.

'We cannot understand how such a heinous crime could happen to two such wonderful and kindhearted people,' the family wrote in a statement

The pain of those victim's families was also given a moment in the statement.

'Our
 family would like to send our love, our thoughts, to the 
relatives and friends of Ann’s and George’s neighbors who tragically 
lost their lives that day,' the niece read. 'We believe they were killed trying to support
 Ann and George, and we are forever grateful.'

She also expressed gratitude to the local police, ambulance crews, medics, and the doctors now caring for the Taylors.

'We have all the faith in
 the world they are doing everything they can to save Ann and George.' she said.

She also thanked the community for their support. 

'Even
 in these troubled times, it is so heartwarming to see the 
entire community come together over this senseless crime that could 
affect any one of us,' she said.

At least one family member accidentally spoke of George in the past tense before catching her error.

'It's guarded,' the anonymous family member said. 'It doesn't look good.'

The couple's niece agreed the couple were on the edge.

'Today,
 Ann and George are fighting for their lives. They are both on 
life-support measures,' she said. 'We remain optimistic, but we 
know this is going to be a tough and long struggle, and we ask for your 
continued prayers and support.'

Bloody afternoon: The Kansas City Police Department investigate the scene of a fatal shooting in the Woodbridge neighborhood that left three people were killed and two others critically wounded Tuesday

Family members said the Taylors 
created a blended family with each having children from previous 
marriages: three adult children to George and two adult children to Ann.
 They shared several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

They had lived on Woodbridge Lane for the last five years and spent nearly their entire lives in the Kansas City area.

Fox 4 KC reported that Ann was an entrepreneur and Red Hat society member while George was a veteran, brick mason, and huge sports fan.

The shootings Tuesday afternoon took place in two homes in a middle-class neighborhood.

The Hurst family said in a statement that Darrel was visiting his mother.

‘While
 we are unsure of all the events that transpired that day, but we are 
comforted knowing they are together,’ the statement said.

‘Our
 prayers go out to the other families and victims in the neighborhood as
 they are struggling to deal with their grief as well. Our hearts are 
broken and we ask for privacy during this difficult time.’

Suspect: Former convict Brandon Howell, 34, pictured left in Wednesday's booking photo and right in a previous mugshot, has been charged with murder in connection to the killings 

A couple of 
hours after the afternoon killing spree Tuesday, police learned that 
three people at a Motel 6 near I-29 and Barry Road  had been physically 
assaulted, and another was nearly carjacked.

The
 police statement said no weapon was used in those assaults. In the 
course of the investigation, police found a 2002 Toyota Highlander that 
had been stolen from one of the crime scenes.

Shortly
 before midnight, officers arrested Brandon Howell, whom they positively
 identified as a suspect in the motel assaults, according to a police 
statement.

Responding police officers also seized a gun from the suspect at the time of his arrest, Fox 4 KC reported. 

According to the shooting victims' neighbors, the deadly spree resulted from a botched robbery.

Local
 residents speaking to Fox 4 KC said that Susan Choucroun and the Hursts
 spotted a man trying to steal a vintage Jaguar from their neighbors' 
house on Woodbridge Lane.

Heartbroken: Charles Choucroun tearfully recalled the moment he was told his wife, Susan, was among the casualties 

Not knowing that the would-be car thief was armed with a shotgun, the victims came up to him as he was trying to drive away and were shot at a point-blank range.

The gunman then jumped into a Toyota Highlander belonging to the couple he had beaten up and took off from the scene.

Neighbor Vicki Gruver, 74, described Lorene Hurst as a lovely lady who enjoyed travel, and Darrel Hurst as a doting son.

Susan Choucroun is survived by her husband, Charles, who owns a beauty salon in Prairie Village. The elderly man was not home at the time of the tragedy.

Speaking to Fox4 KC, the devastated man tearfully recounted how he came home Tuesday only to discover crime scene tape around his block. 

One of the police officers on the scene broke the news to him that his wife was among the victims.

More details also emerged today about the violent past of the man at the center of the triple murder investigation.

Brandon Howell was accused in the late 1990s of killing two teenagers in Johnson County, but in 2009 a jury found him not guilty.

The 34-year-old also has a prior conviction in connection to a 1999 burglary where a cat named Tony was beheaded. He was released on parole in 2011.

A car to die for: Neighbors say the Hursts and Choucroun were killed because they prevented the gunman from staling this vintage Jaguar from a nearby home 

Clue: Police found this 2002 Toyota Highlander that was stolen from one of the crime scenes  

Tom Brewer, the father of 16-year-Tabitha Brewer who was killed along with her boyfriend, Nick Travis, 18, in 1998, told the Kansas City Star Wednesday that when he saw Howell's picture on TV, he immediately recognized him as the man who was acquitted in his daughter's murder.

‘I feel sorry for the jurors who acquitted him the last time because that is going to be hard for them to live with,’ Brewer said. ‘I believe justice is always served one way or another.’ 

The triple homicide - the most deadly incident Kansas City has seen in more than two years - left people living in the middle-class neighborhood shaken.

‘In the last few years we’ve had many young families move in. It is a very, very desirable place to live,’ Jo Lombardino, a member of the Woodbridge Homes Association, told the Kansas City Star.
