World leaders including Prime Minister David Cameron gathered in Prague yesterday for the state funeral of former Czech president Vaclav Havel.

Mr Cameron was joined by former premier Sir John Major, as well as French and German presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Christian Wulff.

The hundreds of mourners at the service in St Vitus Cathedral also included U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton.

Mr Havel died aged 75 on Sunday, 22 
years after leading the peaceful Velvet Revolution that ended  Communist
rule over Czecho- slovakia in 1989.

As well as steering the country to 
democracy, the dissident playwright also oversaw its peaceful division 
into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993.

Before leaving for Prague, Mr Cameron
said: ‘Europe owes Vaclav Havel a profound debt. Havel led the Czech 
people out of tyranny…and he helped bring freedom and democracy to our 
entire continent.’

During the service, the Archbishop of
Prague read out a tribute to Mr Havel from Pope Benedict XVI, praising 
his bravery and vision.

‘Remembering how courageously Mr 
Havel defended human rights at a time when these were systematically 
denied to the people of your country, and paying tribute to his 
visionary leadership…

‘I give thanks to God for the freedom that the people of the Czech Republic now enjoy,’ the Pope’s statement said.

Former U.S. secretary of state 
Madeleine Albright – who was  born in Prague – spoke, as did Czech 
foreign minister Karel Schwarzenberg and current president Vaclav Klaus.
Miss Albright said Mr

Havel ‘brought light to the places of deepest darkness’.

One mourner 14-year-old Anezka Chroustova, said: 'He fought against the communists, stuck to his opinion, made big sacrifices.'

Sirens and church bells rang around the central European country at noon in Havel's memory.

Havel's dissident friend Lech Walesa, the first post-communist democratic president of Poland, was among the guests.

Russia, which Havel criticised for 
human rights abuses and democratic shortfalls as recently as this month,
was represented by rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin. 

He stepped down as Czech president in
2003 but remained a symbol of the struggle for freedom and human rights, 
although his proclamation that 'truth and love must win over lies and 
hatred' turned bitter to some Czechs amid economic hardship and 
corruption in the years after the end of totalitarian rule. 

Around
a thousand guests filled the monumental cathedral for the mass, while 
thousands more followed the service on large screens outside.

Mourning: Dagmar Havlova, widow of late former Czech Repubic President Vaclav Havel     

Before departing from London this morning David Cameron said: 'Europe owes Vaclav Havel a profound 
debt.

'Havel led the Czech 
people out of tyranny ... and he helped bring freedom and democracy to 
our entire continent.'

Bill Clinton's presence was testimony
to his close relationship with Havel, who took him to drink beer in a 
Prague pub and play saxophone in a club when he visited in 
1994.

At the end of the ceremony, 21 cannon salvos were fired when the Czech national anthem was played.

The urn with Havel's ashes will be 
buried at his family's plot at the city's Vinohrady cemetery alongside 
his first wife, Olga, who died in 1996.

Since his death, Czechs have gathered
spontaneously to lay flowers and light candles at key historic sites 
such as the monument to the 1989 Velvet Revolution in downtown Prague, 
and at Wenceslas Square, where Havel once spoke before hundreds of 
thousands of people to express outrage at the repressive communist 
regime.

Similar scenes of remembrance played 
out across the country - in a show of emotion not seen since the 1937 
funeral of Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, Czechoslovakia's first president 
after the nation was founded in 1918.

'He was our star, he gave us 
democracy,' said Iva Buckova, 51, who had traveled from the western city
of Plzen. 'He led us through revolution. We came to see him for the 
last time.'

Prague Archbishop Dominik Duka, who spent time in jail with Havel under Communism, was leading the funeral mass.

He was joined by Vatican envoy 
Giovanni Coppa and bishop Vaclav Maly, Havel's friend and fellow 
dissident. Poland's former President Lech Walesa - who led the 
anti-communist Solidarity movement - also attended.

The Czech Philharmonic Orchestra performed parts of Requiem by Czech composer Antonin Dvorak throughout the ceremony.

Braving the freezing cold, thousands of mourners have waited in long lines every day since Monday to file past Havel's coffin.

On
Wednesday, over 10,000 mourners had marched through Prague's 
cobblestoned medieval streets, led by Havel's actress wife Dagmar, to 
pay their respects.     

Havel, whose dramas of the absurd 
were popular in the 1960s before he was banned from public life after 
the Soviet invasion in 1968, had felt most at home among artists, 
including the Rolling Stones who played in Prague in 1990 just a few 
months after the revolution.

A rock concert and a festival of his 
plays was due to take place later on Friday at the Lucerna Palace that 
the Havel family built in the early 20th century. Four thousand tickets 
to the event were snapped up in minutes.               

He was repeatedly jailed by the 
Soviet-allied Communist authorities in the 1970s and 80s for his 
activism in the Charter 77 civil rights movement and then led the nation
as president from 1989 to 2003.

Many of his plays satirised the evils of the communist regime and were subsequently banned.

Havel,
a former chain smoker, who survived several operations for lung cancer 
and a burst intestine that nearly killed him, died at his country home 
north-east of the Czech capital Prague.

He
had a history of chronic respiratory problems dating back to his years 
locked in dank communist prisons. In recent public appearances recently 
he appeared thin and drawn.

Born
in 1936 to a wealthy family in Czechoslovakia, he began co-writing 
plays during his military service in the 1950s. His first  solo play, 
The Garden Party, was staged in 1963.

A lover of jazz and theatre he 
famously ridiculed the communist state as ‘Absurdistan’. His 
revolutionary motto was: ‘Truth and love must prevail over lies and 
hatred.’

But his works were banned after the 1968 uprising was crushed by a Soviet invasion when tanks rolled into Wenceslas Square.

appeared thin and drawn.

In his final years, Havel made only occasional public appearances, and would often say that he had insufficient time to resume his literary work.

The director of the theater where he began as a stagehand in 1958 before becoming a playwright - and where he said he spent the best 8 years of his life - told AP he'd started work on one last play this year. It was to be called 'Sanatorium.'

'He may be able to finish it in heaven,' said the director of Na Zabradli, Doubravka Svobodova.
