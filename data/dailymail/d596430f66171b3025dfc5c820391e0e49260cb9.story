Conservative David Bishop, who was standing in the Brentwood Borough Council elections made homophobic and anti-Islamic comments on Twitter

A Conservative candidate has quit the party after posting anti-Islamic and homophobic comments on Twitter.

David Bishop, who was due to stand in this month’s council ­elections, resigned after attacking the religion for a ‘psychopathic level of misogyny’ and saying it was ‘good to be anti-Islam’.

Bishop also retweeted a message which read: ‘How can a gay guy keep a straight face?’

Last night, Bishop apologised for any offence he had caused and confirmed he would not be standing for election to Brentwood Borough Council in Essex on May 22.

A Tory Party spokesman added that Bishop’s views had ‘no place in our team’.

The news comes after a Ukip council candidate was facing suspension earlier this week for posting a stream of ‘crackpot’ homophobic and anti-Muslim comments on Twitter and Facebook.

Harry Perry, who is standing in Stockport, said ‘Islam is evil,’ claimed homosexuality was an ‘abomination before God’ and described David Cameron as a ‘gay-loving nutcase’.

Mr Perry’s comments came to light after he sent a private message to the Liberal Democrat general election candidate, Lisa Smart, on Facebook.

One of them said all three mainstream parties were seeking to ‘change our culture as fast as possible without permission from the white indigenous population’, before adding: ‘Don’t you know Lisa that God hates ­homosexuality, you cannot be a Christian and support the gay issue.’

The revelations will heap ­further embarrassment on Ukip leader Nigel Farage

Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall confirmed the party would investigate.

The tweets emerged as the Prime Minister attacked Nigel Farage’s party as ‘discredited’.

The revelations will heap ­further embarrassment on Ukip after another candidate, in North London, tweeted that comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a ‘black ­country’ and compared Islam to the Third Reich.

William Henwood later resigned his membership of the party.
