A Hollywood interior designer - who counts Jessica Alba and Kristen Bell among her clients - has been dragged into a legal dispute over a fostered dog.

Designer Kari Whitman, whose office is based in Beverly Hills, also runs a pet adoption agency in L.A called Ace of Hearts - aimed at re-homing rescue dogs.

Whitman recently appeared on reality TV show Judge Judy after Teresa Gardenhire, a foster parent for dogs, claimed the designer owed her money for taking care of one of the agency's dogs.

Judge Judy ruled in favour of Ace of Hearts in an episode taped on May 23.

But the situation continued to escalate off-screen and eventually Whitman was forced to file a request for a restraining order after allegedly receiving violent threats from Gardenshire.According to TMZ Gardenhire began harassing Whitman, warning her to 'watch her back' and threatening to steal Whitman's rescue dogs in retaliation.

Whitman claimed that she was afraid the 'threats will become real actions' and decided to take legal action.

But Gardenhire says she believed she had adopted the dog in question and was horrified when it was taken away from her.

She even filed a police report - claiming she was the victim of a dog-napping.

A court hearing on the restraining order is listed for June 28.

It is understood the dog involved has already been adopted by another family.
