A fisherman is set to have his probable world-record lake trout disqualified because it was caught in Canada.

Rob Scott of Crane Lake, Minnesota, pulled the 52-pound, 3-ounce fish through the ice on the Ontario side of Lac la Croix on February 8 after an hour-long struggle.

Unfortunately for Scott, 65, earlier that day he had already caught a smaller, four-pound trout and the rules in Canada prevent a fisherman from catching more than one fish per day.

In an attempt to circumnavigate the law which would only allow him to return to Minnesota with one fish, Scott gave the smaller one to a fellow angler.

But two officers from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources had stopped to check Scott's license and noted that he had made his catch, before he caught the behemoth trout.

The world record for a lake trout caught by tip-up through the ice is currently less than 30 pounds and so Scott's massive catch was reported by The Star Tribune as a potential world-record.

Unfortunately for Scott, one of the Ontario-based officers saw the article and recalled that it wasn’t the same fish that Scott had caught when they had stopped him.

Ironically, Scott said he was fishing only about 100 feet from the Minnesota side of Lac la Croix, where the lake trout limit is two

Scott was then interviewed at his home on Monday evening by two Minnesota conservation officers

His trout was also taken into the possession by an Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) officer, after being confiscated from a taxidermist.

It will now be hand-delivered at the border to an investigating officer of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.

In an interview with the Star Tribune Scott conceded that the fish probably was taken in violation of Ontario law, but he argued that given the long time he had spent fighting it it would have died quickly beneath the ice.

‘It wasn’t illegal for me to keep fishing after I caught the first trout. But when I caught the bigger fish, with the adrenaline and everything I had going, and the fact that it wasn’t going to survive if I released it, I figured if I gave the smaller fish away, that would be OK,’ he said.

Lac La Croix is a massive border lake, stretching over 28 miles along the Minnesota/Ontario border

Scott's big trout hasn't been officially weighed, but sadly for Scott any fish caught in violation of the law are not eligible for record-book status

But he was breaking Canadian fishing laws as he had already caught one fish that day - which he then gave to someone else

Scott's behemoth would easily have broken the world record, but has now been disqualified
