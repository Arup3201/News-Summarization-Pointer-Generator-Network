A ‘significant’ number of the 2.5million trees lining Britain’s rail network today faced being chopped down - in an effort to stop them being blown onto tracks during severe weather and causing delays.

Some 1,500 trees or branches fell onto the 20,000-mile network last winter, which was the stormiest period of UK weather experienced for two decades, according to a Department for Transport report.

About a third of these incidents resulted in collisions, with 430 cases of trains striking trees or branches over the winter - often significantly damaging trains and disrupting services.

Danger: Some 1,500 trees or branches fell onto the 20,000-mile network last winter, according to a report. Pictured is a tree blocking the line at Gartshore in Dunbartonshire, Scotland, last December

Network Rail's current policy on vegetation is to clear trees and bushes to 10ft (3m) to 16ft (5m) from the rail depending on line speed, and 11ft 6in (3.5m) from overhead power lines.

But the report said: ‘This policy in no way adequately addresses the risk of trees being blown onto the line in high winds, or the damage they can do to the long term stability of slopes.

‘It is not clear to us that there is a defined budget for vegetation management… We consider that Network Rail needs to substantially strengthen its vegetation management policy.’

The report recommends that Network Rail develops a ten-year strategy to 'significantly' reduce the number of lineside trees - but also offsets the loss of vegetation by planting trees further away.

Last winter Britain was hit by 13 major storms, including the St Jude’s Storm on October 28, 2013 which hit an extraordinary 99mph at The Needles Old Battery at Totland Bay on the Isle of Wight.

Most of the damage caused by that storm was associated with falling trees, which were still in full leaf at that time of year - and the tempest was within the ten worst to affect the South in 40 years.

Network Rail believes that 25,000 of the 2.5million lineside trees with a trunk diameter of at least 5.9in (15cm) are in a risk category - based on the likelihood of them falling, their location and size.

Former Eurostar chairman Richard Brown, who authored the Transport Resilience Review, said: ‘There is no silver bullet or instant solution to make our transport systems more resilient - instead it is a task of attending to 101 details.

‘But by prioritising our efforts, applying already good practices much more widely and ensuring that transport operators and authorities learn continuously from other's experience as well as their own, there is much that can be achieved.

‘It will not be possible to make our transport systems totally resilient - the forces of nature will still on occasions prove too powerful.

'But where there is disruption there is 
more that can be done to minimise its duration and impact, and to 
improve how passengers and road users are communicated with.’

'The damage and disruption caused by fallen trees on the railway last winter underlined the need for a more proactive approach to the way we manage what grows along the tracks'

Network Rail spokesman

The report came with 60 recommendations and also looked at the highways network, proposing for example that driving theory tests should have questions on how to cope with bad weather.

A Network Rail spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘The damage and disruption caused by fallen trees on the railway last winter underlined the need for a more proactive approach to the way we manage what grows along the tracks.

‘It’s no coincidence that HS1, which was built to modern engineering standards with appropriate levels of trackside vegetation, was unaffected by the extreme weather.

‘Our new vegetation management 
strategy seeks to strike the right balance between encouraging 
biodiversity on the railway and protecting the network from fallen 
trees, focusing on known high-risk locations.

‘As part of this strategy, we will be 
working closely with local communities and environmental groups to 
discuss how best to manage any significant reduction in lineside 
vegetation.’

However, a Wildlife Trust spokesman told the Daily Express: ‘Cutting down trees by railways can cause damage, such as where mature woodland is established.

‘The
 railway network can also be an important corridor for wildlife, and 
clearance of trees along it should be part of a wider conservation plan.
 But in some places removing trees could help boost wildflower 
grassland.’

Wildlife Trust spokesman

And Bob Elliot, the head of RSPB investigations, told MailOnline: ‘The habitat alongside the rail network could provide one of our greatest nature reserves.

‘Over the last three years, we have been advising Network Rail and reminding them that clearing scrub and trees during the sensitive spring and summer nesting period may not only threaten nesting birds, but is also potentially against the law.

‘Any removal of trees and dense vegetation should be undertaken sensitively with a programme of replacement planting, habitat creation and management - this could actually create many more homes for nature.

‘There seems to be a great opportunity here to dramatically improve Network Rail’s estate for the benefit of wildlife, but this work needs to be planned ahead of time, to avoid threatening nesting birds and other breeding species.’
