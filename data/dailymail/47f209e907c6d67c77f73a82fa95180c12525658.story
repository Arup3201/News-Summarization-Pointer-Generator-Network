The wife and girlfriend of the Painter of Light, Thomas Kinkade, are preparing for battle to decide who gets what of his $60 million estate.

The two sides will come face to face in an Los Angeles probate court on Monday, both claiming to have been left the artist's fortune.

Kinkade was America's most collected artist before his death four months ago, with his work said to hang in one in 20 homes in the States, including the White House.

Battle: Thomas Kinkade's girlfriend says that the 'Painter of Light' left her his two estates and an additional $10million in a barely-legible will

He died after ingesting a cocktail of
alcohol and valium, having battled with alcoholism for two years and 
the women are now engaged in a bitter fight to secure what they each 
claim is rightfully theirs.

Mr Kinkade’s mistress, Amy 
Pinto-Walsh, recently produced a shakily-written will that states she is
entitled to his Monte Sereno, California mansion and an additional 
$10million to start a museum at that location, as well as another 
$66.3million in original artwork and collected paintings.

Pinto-Walsh claims the barely-legible will was written by the 54-year-old Kinkade on November 18 of last year and gives her control over his two properties nestled in Monte Sereno, a wealthy neighbourhood in Los Gatos.

Family: The artist's wife Nanette, pictured right with their four daughters, said her husband provided his family with a 'wonderful life'

The document, originally obtained by the San Jose Mercury News, was scribbled on what seems to be a piece of paper from a legal notepad.

It reads: ‘I, Thomas Kinkade, being of 
sound mind and body do hereby bequeath to Amy Pinto Walsh $10,000,000 in
cash from my corporate policy.’

Entitled: Amy Pinto-Walsh claims the will is Kinkade's and gives her millions of dollars

He also wrote that Pinto-Walsh should have his two properties on Ridgecrest Avenue ‘for her security.’

It is signed and dated November 18, 2011.

In a declaration filed on Thursday Pinto-Walsh said: 'The establishment of the museum was very important to Thomas,' the LA Times reported.

'He went to great lengths to describe
for me and to show me his vision for the museum. It is my every 
intention to see that his wishes are carried out.'

The painter was married to Nanette Kinkade for more than 30 years and had four daughters together. Pinto-Walsh, who was called a gold-digger by the estranged Mrs Kinkade, said after the painter’s death that the two were planning to wed after his divorce was finalised.

In April, lawyers portrayed Mr 
Kinkade's girlfriend as a ruthless gold digger who is out to 'tear down'
the late artist's reputation and do irreparable damage to his family.

The
restraining order against Amy Pinto-Walsh claimed she broke a 
confidentiality agreement by talking to reporters the morning Mr Kinkade
was found dead and threatened to reveal his business and personal 
secrets.

The artist's 
bodyguard - who drove him around after he was caught drink driving - 
said the family had reason to fear Pinto-Walsh because she was prone to 
'impulsive and erratic' behavior and once threatened to 'tear Mr Kinkade
down'.

'Amy was already part of his circle of friends and that really enraged Nanette,' an unnamed source told Radar Online.

Will and testament: The will was written on notepaper and is barely legible

'Nanette was furious and humiliated that he not only cheated on her, but moved on so quickly and publicly with her.'

She didn't make any attempt to hide 
her frustration either, as she filed a restraining order against his 
mistress shortly after his death, wanting to stop her from breaching a confidentiality agreement she signed more than a year ago.

The so-called 'Painter of Light' used to estimate that around one out of every 20 homes in America.

His estate - of which Mrs Kinkade is 
the principal trustee - has filed documents with a Santa Clara court 
seeking an injunction against Ms Pinto-Walsh, according to Los Gatos 
Patch.

Painter of light: Mr Kinkade's talent, shown here in Living Waters: Golfer's Paradise, Hole One is a characteristic of his serene style that put roughly one of his paintings in every 20 homes

Success: Mr Kinkade's works were popular, but his battle with alcoholism led him to an arrest for DUI (right)

Mr Kinkade died of accidental acute intoxication from alcohol
and an anti-anxiety medication, an autopsy report revealed.

The
Santa Clara County Coroner's Office reported Kinkade's cause of death 
as 'acute ethanol and Diazepam intoxication' and manner of death as 
'accident,' according to NBC Bay Area.

Diazepam is the active ingredient in name-brand drug Valium.

Kinkade, whose works captivated 
millions of Americans despite the scorn of many art critics, died in 
April at his home in Northern California at the age of 54.

The coroner’s report also said the painter suffered from ‘hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease.’

Father: Mr Kinkade, pictured here drawing his daughter Winsor, was said by his brother to have been cleaning himself up to remain in his children's lives

In layman’s terms, Kinkade had high blood pressure and thickened artery walls in his heart due to high cholesterol.

His
brother told the San Jose Mercury News newspaper that the painter had 
battled alcoholism for several years and suffered a relapse before he 
died.

Patrick Kinkade said 
his brother had been burdened in recent years by a separation from his 
wife, financial troubles and the low opinion of his work by critics.

Thomas Kinkade was arrested for drunk driving in 2010, the same year his company filed for bankruptcy.

Art galleries reported a surge in sales of Kinkade's paintings following his death.
