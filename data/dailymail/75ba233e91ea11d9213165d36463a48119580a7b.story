Belgium are hoping for a quick recovery over the weekend from first choice defenders Vincent Kompany and Thomas Vermaelen as both remain doubtful for their World Cup match against the United States on Tuesday.

Anthony Vanden Borre was ruled out of the tournament on Friday after a scan revealed a crack in his fibula while back-up defender Laurent Ciman is also on the injury list as the team prepare for their last 16 match in Salvador.

Vanden Borre will be out for at least six weeks, said coach Marc Wilmots via Twitter. His fellow right back Ciman has a groin strain.

Doubtful: Captain Vincent Kompany may miss Belgium's World Cup last 16 clash against USA

Fighting fit? Defender Thomas Vermaelen also faces a battle to play vs USA after a hamstring injury

Captain Kompany missed Thursday's last group match against South Korea, where Wilmots made wholesale changes after the Belgians had already secured qualification, and also sat out training at their team base in Mogi das Cruzes on Friday.

Kompany continues to be troubled by a groin problem which Wilmots said he hoped would improve with rest over the weekend.

Vermaelen has a hamstring strain and trained lightly on his own on Friday with the assistance of medical staff.

'I'm happy we have had an extra day's rest because we won our group,' said Wilmots, whose team would have played on Monday rather than Tuesday had they finished runners-up in Group H.

'We still have four days. I hope most of them will be fit then.'

But he said he had already figured a solution if that proved not the case. '(Nacer) Chadli can play at right back and (Moussa) Dembele on the left of defence. I don't see a problem. But I hope that as many as possible are available,' he told reporters.

Vanden Borre was one of the seven changes the Belgians made for their 1-0 win over South Korea in Sao Paulo, making his World Cup finals debut, but was injured right at the end of the game.
