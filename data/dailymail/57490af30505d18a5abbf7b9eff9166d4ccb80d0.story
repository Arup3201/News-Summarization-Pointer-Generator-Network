A 20-year-old man was arrested Friday night in connection with the murder of a 99-year-old woman in upstate New York.

Javon Tyrek Rogers was arrested by and charged in connection with the Wednesday death of Fannie Gumbinger in her Poughkeepsie, NY home. Rogers was charged with first-degree murder and first-degree burglary, according to a Poughkeepsie Police Department press release. Rogers is also considered a suspect in multiple burglaries nearby.

Officials have not released details surrounding Gumbinger’s murder other than to say she died of multiple injuries.

Almost a century old: Fannie Gumbinger, 99, was allegedly murdered by 20-year-old Javon Tyrek Rogers, according to police

‘She was sharp as a tack,’ niece Jacqueline Solomon told WABC, adding that her aunt was ‘upbeat, opinionated and loved having lunch with her friends.’

Gumbinger was found dead Wednesday afternoon by her home health aide, according to the Daily Freeman.

‘I can’t imagine why people would have gone into that house, other than the fact that she was a defenseless old lady,’ Solomon told WABC, adding ‘she had a little jar on her table and in it she would have some 50 dollars, and some 20s, that’d be the most that she would have in the house.’

Investigators spent the past couple of days combing Gumbinger’s house for evidence and expected to be finished sometime Saturday, an official told the Poughkeepsie Journal. MailOnline was unable to reach a police spokesperson for further comment.

Authorities investigating a string of burglaries in the surrounding neighborhood also have reason to believe Rogers may be linked, according to the Journal. One of the burglaries even took place a few hours after Gumbinger's death only blocks from her home, according to YNN.

‘We can’t say that it is positively connected, but we cannot say that it isn’t,’ police spokesperson Edward Freer told WABC.

Gumbinger‘s husband died in 2007, according to the Freeman. She had also outlived most of her siblings and friends, according to WABC. Her only health ailments were a bad leg and hip, the station added.

It is not clear if Rogers has a prior criminal history, a search of court documents did not yield any results. The accused was arraigned and is currently being held without bail in Dutchess County Jail.
