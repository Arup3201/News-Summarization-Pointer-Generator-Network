Manchester City’s reputation at home and abroad is in tatters after it emerged they have been responsible for a trail of misinformation and confusion over their signing of Frank Lampard. 

City are already fighting to keep the American public onside after their decision to retain Lampard’s services for the second half of the Barclays Premier League season, rather than release him to play in MLS for feeder club New York City FC as planned. 

The club’s image took a further pounding after they were forced to admit they had unintentionally misled the public on both sides of the Atlantic from the moment it was announced Lampard had ‘signed’ for NYCFC on a two-year deal last summer.  

Manchester City have admitted that they have misled fans and New York City over Frank Lampard

City had wrongly claimed that Lampard signed for New York City last summer before agreeing a loan move

PL apps: 3 starts (12 sub apps) Goals: 5

FA Cup: 1 Goals: 0

League Cup: 1 Goals: 2

Champions League: 1 (1) Goals: 0 

TOTAL APPS: 6 (13) TOTAL GOALS: 7

That, was not true. Nor was the subsequent announcement that the 36-year-old had joined City on a ‘loan’ until the end of the calendar year. The truth, admitted by City, is that Lampard put his name only to a pre-contract agreement with NYCFC, stipulating that he would join them on January 1. 

The only binding contract he signed was with City, one that saw him contracted to the club for one season with a ‘break clause’ inserted that would enable him to head to New York for MLS pre-season in January if deemed convenient.

We know now that City, quite legally, removed that clause on New Year’s Eve in order to keep him until the end of the season.

Under pressure from the media and unhappy fans in America, City finally admitted some of this on Friday only to then find themselves in trouble with the Premier League.

The whole affair has left supporters on both sides of the Atlantic angry and confused, click here to read Sportsmail's six questions that must be answered. 

In releasing five points of clarification Friday lunchtime, City admitted making ‘mistakes’ and ‘errors’ in their initial announcements regarding Lampard.

However, the Premier League were furious to see City claiming that Lampard’s contract with them had only been until December 31 and that there had been no break clause. Instead, City claimed, Lampard had merely signed a second short-term contract with them on December 31.

This angered Premier League officials as not only was it not true, it would also have been in direct contravention of Rule T11 that stipulates no player contract can be for less than 12 months.

After contact from the League Friday, City backed down and privately conceded that Lampard’s contract had been for the whole season.

But they have not broken any rules throughout and will not face any punishment. But Friday the headline in the influential New York Post labelled the whole Lampard situation as a ‘fraud’. Even though representatives from NYCFC are due to meet disgruntled fans for talks today, it seems all goodwill in MLS has already been lost.

Over here, City face searching questions about why the whole saga has been characterised by untruth and misinformation from the start. City’s stance Friday was that the initial announcements — in New York and Manchester — were simple mistakes.

There is no direct proof to the contrary but it seems incredible that a club of City’s size — with an ever expanding communications team — could make such an error, given that announcements about Lampard’s ‘signing’ were followed up by tweets and other social media news flashes essentially carrying the same message.

One school of thought, popular in America, is that it was in City and NYCFC’s best interests to announce Lampard’s ‘signing’ to help season-ticket sales along in the US. City deny this and say the announcement was just an error. It would perhaps not have had the same effect had it been revealed that he had actually signed for City with a clause meaning he ‘may’ come to New York in January.

That is all speculative and suggestions that Lampard never intended to switch to New York this month are quite wrong. It is only Lampard’s impressive form on the field that has seen him retained. He has simply proved more valuable to manager Manuel Pellegrini than anybody ever imagined he would.

I want to make it completely clear about my situation as I have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days. 

When released from Chelsea last year at the end of my contract I signed a commitment to play in NYC FC for two years starting January 1 2015. I was then offered the chance to train and be part of the Man City squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into New York.

This period has since been extended by Man City and I now will start playing for NYC FC at the end of this current Premier League season. There has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone.

I can say that I am very excited about arriving in New York and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the MLS as soon as possible. 

Thanks everyone for your ongoing support and I wish everyone a healthy and happy 2015!

Calls made to Lampard’s representatives to ask why a former England captain allowed himself to be part of something that has subsequently turned out to be misleading were also not returned.

Earlier on, however, Lampard did issue a statement designed to ‘clear up’ any confusion.

The statement said: ‘I want to make it completely clear about my situation as I have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days. When released from Chelsea last year at the end of my contract I signed a commitment to play for NYCFC for two years starting January 1, 2015. I was then offered the chance to train and be part of the Man City squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into New York.
