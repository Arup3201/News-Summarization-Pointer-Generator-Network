This is the moment those looking for a caffeine fix had a startling brush with a fox in the Caffe Nero at the BBC's headquarters in central London. 

The footage shows the seemingly afraid fox enter the branch at New Broadcasting House in Portland Place.

Customers in the coffee shop appear unfazed and begin to film the encounter on their mobile phones.

It's the fox who appears more disturbed by the encounter and is seen darting quickly between chairs and tables looking for an escape.

A man with a briefcase eventually shoos the creature out of the door.

An employee who captured the footage, posted it on YouTube yesterday, where it has had more than 15,000 views. 

The Italian-style coffee chain opened at New Broadcasting House in 2013 and occupies a large unit on the ground floor.  

Earlier this week, guests at a Travelodge in south east London were shocked by the startling appearance of a 'blue' fox.

A bewildered fox - which appeared to have been painted blue - wandered inside the Woolwich hotel and had to be coaxed out with a packet of crisps.
