A man accused of murdering his girlfriend and dumping her body in a suitcase appeared in court today.

Laszlo Gyarmati, 29, is accused of killing Hungarian Alexandra Kovacs, 25, before stuffing her body into the bag on July 18 and dumping it in bushes in a sports ground near her home in Mill Hill, London.

Hungarian Gyarmati, from Finchley, north London, appeared via videolink at the Old Bailey today charged with her murder.

Murdered: Hungarian Alexandra Kovacs, 25, was killed and her body stuffed into the bag before being dumped in bushes in a sports ground near her home

Court case: Alexandra Kovacs' boyfriend has been remanded in custody on suspicion of her murder

The court heard how Ms Kovacs' house mates heard screams at around 3am on July 18 and never saw her again.

They reported her missing to the police two days later.

Police discovered her body stuffed in a suitcase and abandoned in bushes at around 5pm on July 21.

Scene: Police tape over the entrance to the woodlands where Kovacs' body was found in a suitcase near her home in Mill Hill, north London

Missing: Miss Kovacs' housemates heard her screaming in the early hours of July 18 but never saw her again

But a post mortem examination has not been able to establish her cause of death and further tests have been ordered.

Wearing a light blue prison issue shirt and trousers, Gyarmati spoke through an interpreter only to confirm his name.

No indication of plea was given and no bail application was made.

Gyarmati was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on October 14 for a plea and case management hearing.

Victim: Miss Kovacs' flatmates reported her missing on July 20 - her body was found a day later in an abandoned suitcase

Mystery: A post mortem examination could not establish Alexandra Kovacs's cause of death

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
