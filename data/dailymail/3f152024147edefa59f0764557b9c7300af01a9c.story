One of America's richest businessmen has denied claims that he was detained following a car accident in Cuba after 'hitting a local kid with his car'.

Daniel S. Loeb, the hedge fund manager who founded Third Point LLC, was involved in an accident while enjoying a weekend trip to Cuba, according to Vanity Fair.

The piece, written for the magazine's December edition, alleges that the incident happened while Loeb, 51, was on holiday with friends in 2002.

But Mr Loeb's lawyer told the New York Post that the allegations are 'entirely untrue'.

Mr Loeb is number 341 on the Forbes 400 list of America's richest people and is said to be worth $1.65billion (Â£1.02billion).

In the Vanity Fair piece William D. Cohan claims that Mr Loeb was accompanied on the trip by his friend Alexander von Furstenberg.

But Mr Cohan writes that 'things unexpectedly took a dark turn.'

According to vanity Fair, former Third Point analyst Youlia Miteva, who accused Loeb of breach of contract in a lawsuit, said: 'Cuban authorities had refused to allow him to leave'.'

Mr Cohan adds that earlier this year, while compiling a separate Vanity Fair piece, Mr Loeb told him that he had been involved in a car accident, and 'stuck around' for a couple of weeks before a legal hearing.

The article adds that a former friend of Loeb, hedge funder Robert Chapman Jr told Cohan that Loeb had called him 'desperate' and 'sobbing' from a hotel room in Cuba.

He told Mr Cohan 'how scared' Loeb had sounded when giving details of the incident 'involving his hitting a Cuban kid with his car'.

According to the New York Post, Mr Loeb's art dealer friend Christophe Van de Weghe, who claims to have been in Cuba at the time of the accident, denies that Loeb ever spent any time in prison.

Mr Loeb's lawyer told the Post: 'The statements you attribute to Mr Chapman, Gross and an 'unidentified source' are entirely untrue, defamatory and libelous, and will be treated as such.'

MailOnline has attempted to contact Third Point and Mr Loeb's lawyer and is awaiting a response.

Mr Loeb hit the headlines earlier this year when actor George Clooney hit out at 'inflammatory' comments the hedge fund manager made about the movie industry.

In an interview with Deadline.com, the star called billionaire Loeb a 'carpetbagger', claiming the Wall Street tycoon 'knows nothing' about the film business.

Loeb's Third Point hedge fund controls seven percent of Sony stock and he had criticised Sony Entertainment after its two big budget films After Earth and White House Down, 'bombed spectacularly' at the box office.
