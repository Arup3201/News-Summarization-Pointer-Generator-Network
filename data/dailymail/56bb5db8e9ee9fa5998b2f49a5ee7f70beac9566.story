Fernando Torres is digging his heels in at Chelsea and the Stamford Bridge club will have to pay £16million for him to leave.

The £50m flop has attracted interest from the likes of Roma, but any buying club will struggle to pay Torres' £150,000-a-week wages.

The Spanish striker therefore wants Chelsea to pay up the two years remaining on his deal - totalling around £16m - if he is to leave the club.

There is frustration from both parties around Torres' future - Chelsea at Torres' refusal to see any potential move through and the striker at his lack of first-team opportunities.

The striker, who posted a video of himself undertaking the Ice Bucket Challenge in Ibiza to Instagram on Monday, didn't make the bench for Jose Mourinho's side's 2-0 win over Leicester on Saturday, with new signing Diego Costa and returning Blues icon Didier Drogba both preferred.

Despite leaving Torres out of the win, Mourinho insisted he needs three strikers in his squad: ‘I want three strikers in the team. Sometimes I want to play with two and have one on the bench. At other times, someone will be suspended, another will be injured.

'Someone will be needed as a third striker. I can’t do a season without a third striker. Our squad was made carefully the top structure of my club to give me what I want.

‘I believe he will remain. I want him. He will play. He will score goals. He will be very useful for us. He is a fantastic guy, fantastic professional, so no problem.

'I told the players yesterday that at this moment we are playing one match a week and they feel: “Oh, I’m playing, I’m not playing. I’m first option, I’m second, I’m third.”

'But this is over next week. After that we have Capital One cup and Champions League and three matches a week. Everything is much easier for them then because all of them will be playing.

‘The reason he wasn’t on the bench today was that I decided to have a balanced bench with one defender, one full back, one defence midfielder, one attacking midfielder on winger and one striker. Sometimes I can have two strikers on the bench sometimes I can’t.’
