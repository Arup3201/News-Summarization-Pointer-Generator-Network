Prince Harry confessed he was a bit 'past it' as he put young rugby players through their paces at Twickenham today.

The fourth in line to the throne, who is a qualified rugby coach and keen fan, was challenged to show his talent by England World Cup winner Jason Robinson, who joked that the Prince could be in line for a call-up to the national squad.

'We're looking for a winger,' said Robinson, 39, who helped Harry coach youngsters from state schools taking part in the RFU All Schools Programme.

After the game Robinson, looking over at the Prince , said: 'He's dripping with sweat. He's put everything into this'

'I'll be looking to see what you've got.'

But Harry, 29, replied: 'I think I'm a bit past it already.'

The All Schools programme aims to expand rugby into 750 state schools as part of the legacy of England hosting the 2015 World Cup.

Robinson, who went to state schools in Leeds and represented Great Britain at rugby league before switching codes and captaining the England rugby union side, gave Harry a pair of the same type of white and red boots he wore as an international to take part in the coaching session on Twickenham's hallowed turf.

'I can't guarantee that they'll get you into the England team but you'll go quick,' said Robinson.

Changing into the boots, Harry stripped off his tracksuit and put his expensive designer watch inside a training shoe.

'No one's going to nick my watch?' he asked an aide, before having second thoughts and handing it to him for safekeeping.

'Keep an eye on that one,' he said cheekily gesturing toward Robinson.

On the pitch, the pair of them trained groups of boys and girls from schools around the country.

'Pass the ball, pass,' shouted Harry. 'Get Jason. Seriously, I'm knackered.'

He has too many other commitments these days to be able to play the game regularly.

Robinson, looking over at the Prince later, said: 'He's dripping with sweat. He's put everything into this.'

Asked about Harry's admission that he was past it, the England hero said: 'I must admit he was blowing on a few occasions. He was heading for the water.'

The 29-year-old Prince and Robinson, who won 51 caps for his country, carried on the banter during a photo session with the children afterwards.

At one point, Harry tugged Robinson's ear as they posed for pictures with the kids.

He also jokingly complained about being man-handled during the coaching session with the pupils.

'There were one or two bad tackles,' he said

Despite his admission that he was 'past it', Harry put on an energetic and athletic display while joining in the game

Working off the calories: Prince Harry joined a rugby union coaching session at Twickenham Stadium today

Prince Harry delivered a training session alongside RFU coaching staff on the Rugby pitch, before heading inside the stadium to meet young people taking part in a kit design workshop, designed to help them take pride in their team colours

After almost two hours out on the pitch, he went inside the stadium to meet 50 pupils designing their own kit as part of a sponsorship deal between the RFU and the England kit manufacturers, Canterbury.

Each school participating in the programme is given 20 bespoke shirts once the pupils have decided on a design.

Harry, who is patron of the All Schools programme, went around tables, asking the pupils how they could inspire more of their schoolmates to take up the sport.

'You've got to make rugby cool,' he told boys from The Warwick School in Redhill, Surrey.

In the first year of the Â£10 million coaching programme, the 2012-13 season, 104 state secondary schools and 40,000 pupils participated in the scheme.

Some 150 teachers were trained to coach rugby. This season a further 100 schools have joined the scheme.

The schools taking part in the coaching on the Twickenham turf today were: Kelvin Hall School in Hull; Oakbank School from Keighley in Yorkshire; Oxclose Community Academy from Tyne and Wear, Stonehill High School, Leicester, and Rokeby School from Newham, East London, where the RFU has paid for the school to have a new artificial pitch.

Robinson, who got interested in rugby league because of an enthusiastic teacher at his state secondary in Leeds and only switched to union at 26, suggested by taking the game out of its heartland in independent schools and expanding into the state sector, England could unearth more talent like himself.

'Some of these kids are living in challenging situations at home,' he said.

'I know what it's like to be from a single parent family. My mum was a cleaner. I never thought I'd be coming out here to play for England.'

Later in the day the prince met footballing legend Sir Bobby Charlton, during the official opening of the Royal British Legion Centre for Blast Injury Studies at Imperial College London.
