A compulsive hoarder was left trapped for 30 hours after getting stuck under a mountain of his own clutter.

Retired engineer Noel Rainer, 85, became wedged between a chaotic mess of bags, boxes and piles of debris after falling over a 2ft-high mound of paper in his kitchen.

The pensioner couldn't even reach his nearby phone to call for help because of the clutter, which covers every inch of his home in Halstead, Essex.

It was only when Mr Rainer's relatives became concerned that police and firefighters were called in to help rescue him from his home. 

But he said he had Radio 3 to keep him company as he waited for help to arrive.

Mr Rainer is thought to have Diogenes syndrome, also known as senile squalor syndrome, which means he can't stop hoarding rubbish.

As he recovered from his ordeal with daughter Cherry, he said: 'I had a pile of papers about 2ft high and I just stepped back and fell over backwards.

'My legs were in the air and I was just in a little cocoon. I was just on my own. I knew I would be OK, but it was a bit lonely. I had Radio 3 on the whole time so I kept up with the news.

The house in Halstead, Essex, is now being cleared of the clutter - some of which dates back to the 1960s

'The phone was in the distance, but it fell off its hook.

'My daughter couldn't lift me out, but once the emergency services arrived it was only about five or ten minutes, then we were sitting outside - they were wonderful.'

Daughter Ms Rainer said her 'fiercely independent' father's condition has not been officially diagnosed but they believe he has Diogenes syndrome.

Mr Rainer was taken to Colchester General Hospital with minor injuries but is now recovering well.

Meanwhile, professional cleaners have started the tricky task of sorting out his clutter and making the house safer to live in. 

Medical condition: It is believed Mr Rainer suffers from Diogenes syndrome - also known as senile squalor syndrome - which means he can't stop hoarding rubbish

The four-bedroom house and its three-car garage are stacked from floor to ceiling with newspapers dating back to the 1960s, magazines, bulk-buy toilet paper, stockpiled food and washing powder.

Ms Rainer, of Hills Road, Sible Hedingham, Braintree, Essex, said: 'It is his own house - he's not renting it - so nobody had been able to do anything about it. He keeps hold of everything that's put through the letterbox.

'He buys everything when they are on offer, so he'll have lots of toilet rolls stored up, then puts them somewhere and can never find them.'

Mr Rainer's hoarding has become worse since his retirement and divorce.

Ms Rainer said: 'It's so sad and tragic. He had all these projects he had on the go in his garage. He gave up on them 20 years ago, but he never gave up collecting the raw materials - he says yes to everything.'
