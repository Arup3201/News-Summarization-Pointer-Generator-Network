Rebecca and Paul Cutts said their big day was ruined when the reception was hit by a string of mishaps

A heartbroken bride was left in tears after claiming a top hotel served up a 'Fawlty Towers' fiasco complete with a drunken chef and 'obnoxious' staff.

Rebecca Cutts booked her big day at the hotel, which once featured on TV's The Hotel Inspector, when she married her partner Paul.

But the couple, from Rawmarsh, near Rotherham, say their big day was ruined when the reception was hit by a string of mishaps that saw some of the 65 guests served food that was still frozen and uncooked.

The couple, both aged 30, claim Champagne they had paid for was not served and some of the guests were not served the food they should have been, while those who were faced long delays.

The couple say when they did complain, staff at the Sandygate Hotel, Wath-upon-Dearne, South Yorkshire, were dismissive and told them: 'What do you expect for a cheap wedding?'

The hotel has said it is aware of the complaints and is working to resolve them.

The hotel's acting manager has said the couple stayed the night at the hotel, had breakfast the next morning and left without making any complaints

The couple were organising their wedding on a tight budget after Paul, a trained chef, was made redundant from his job at a Job Centre.

Devastated Mrs Cutts, a special needs carer, said : 'It was a disaster a complete joke from start to finish. Our reception was ruined by a drunken chef who couldn't stand up.

'If it had not been so serious and such a disaster for us it would have been laughable. It was like an episode from Fawlty Towers with the drunken chef and obnoxious staff.

'Paul saw the chef who could hardly stand he had been drinking so much and just like on Fawlty Towers the staff were running round trying to sort things out.

'Some meals were served frozen, they ran out of stock on a pre-ordered menu and desserts were only served to half the guests.

The couple say when they did complain, staff at the Sandygate Hotel, Wath-upon-Dearne, South Yorkshire, were dismissive and told them: 'What do you expect for a cheap wedding?'

'We booked a three course meal for 65 guests and there was a 45 minute delay from the top table being served and the rest.

'The
 food was disgusting. The staff were very arrogant, disorganised and 
unprofessional and the owner was very rude when we complained. All our 
happy memories for that day are just wiped out.'

Mrs Cutts said the hotel was 'nasty' when they complained two days later.

She said: 'We realised at the time that things were going wrong but we didn't realise just how bad until the next day or two because the guests were trying to keep the worst away from us because they knew we would be so upset.'

The couple say that out of the 65 guests, 19 sent the food back, some of which was raw according to the couple.

The couple claim Champagne they had paid for was not served and some of the guests were not served the food that should have been, while those who were faced long delays

Mrs Cutts added that fish fingers for 
children were frozen and said other guests even took pictures of the 
food because it was so bad.

Mrs Cutts posted comments on the travel website Tripadvisor after the wedding saying: 'Booked our wedding reception at the Sandygate. Complete disaster from start to finish. 3 course meal and food was disgusting. Some meals were served frozen, very unprofessional, arrogant staff and owner doesn't have a clue!!

'I wouldn't recommend the Sandygate to anyone, I'm disgusted at how we've been treated and the response to our complaint was "what do you expect from a cheap wedding" well for one it's the price they quoted for what we wanted and secondly what we received wasn't fit for a dog.

Mrs Cutts said when she complained the owner of the hotel told her she had spent £5,000 on her own wedding

'I'm heart broken that we booked there, they ruined the best day of my life. Stay away please don't let them ruin your day.'

Mrs Cutts said she eventually spoke to the owner who told her she had spent £5,000 on her own wedding.

She said: 'We had booked with the previous owner and paid £50 deposit which we lost.

'When we went to see the new owner and told her what we wanted she gave us that price. We paid for Champagne but didn't get it.

'They said they had sent the chef home and the wedding organiser and other staff took over but he was still there later. They shouldn't offer a service at any price if they can't do it decently.'

Acting manager of the hotel Simon Tarrington said : 'We are aware of the complaints and we will deal with it in our own way.

'But this couple stayed the night at the hotel, had breakfast the next morning and left without making any complaints to the staff.

'It was only a few days later that we had a phone call from them with the complaints. We have had two other wedding receptions and both families said it was the best reception they had ever been to.

'Also we laid on a buffet following a funeral this week. That was a difficult situation for the family but they were so happy with the buffet and service they left a £30 tip for the staff.'

The 11-room hotel featured on Channel Five's 'Hotel Inspector' series three years ago, when it was run by Elvis impersonator Dave Elliott and his wife. It was revamped but last year the couple abandoned the hotel as bailiffs moved in. The hotel had up to 50 weddings booked at the time.
