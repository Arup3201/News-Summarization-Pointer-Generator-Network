Northerners have £15 less spare cash a day than those in London and the South East, official figures revealed today.

On average people in the North East, North West and Yorkshire have £14,635 a year to save or spend on themselves.

This is more than £5,000 less than the £20,286 available to those living in the South East - or some £108.37 a week.

Londoners have almost 30% more spare cash than the UK average

The stark north-south divide was revealed by the Office for National Statistics in its annual disposable cash figures.

The ONS also released figures today revealing how record numbers of people are now working from home - with one in seven Brits doing their job away from the office.

In 2012 Londoners had the most spare cash - with £21,446 available to save or spend. Northern Ireland had the lowest in the UK, with the average person only having £13,902.

Those in the Home Counties around London sit second in the disposable cash league table - with £19,126 to spend every year.

In England families in the North East are the worst off - with each person having just £14,393 to spend a year. The Yorkshire is second with £ 14,575 of spare cash per person. Those in the North West meanwhile have £14,939.

Breaking the figures down even further, the difference between parts of the country is even starker.

People in 'Inner London - West' - covering posh Kensington, Chelsea and Mayfar - have the most spare cash in the country with £36,963 available to save or spend. Nottingham meanwhile had the lowest, with the average person only having £11,411 for themselves. The £25,552 gap works out at more than £70 a day.

People in Northern Ireland are the worst off in the UK. The Scots and Welsh also have less spare cash than the English

Overall, the amount of spare cash Brits have in the pocket grew in every region of the country between 2011 and 2012.

Despite being the poorest region, the North East had the strongest growth in disposable income - at four per cent, followed by Wales at 3.8 per cent. Northern Ireland had the weakest growth at 2.7 per cent.

The average amount of disposable income across the country was £16,791 in 2012. Just four regions - London, the South East, the East of England and the South West - have more disposable cash than the UK average.

Meanwhile, separate figures released by the Office for National Statistics today reveal a record number of people are working from home after a huge increase over the past decade, new figures have shown.

There were 4.2 million home workers in the first quarter of the year, around 14 per cent of those in work in Britain, ranging from childminding and care work to managers and senior company officials. This amounts to one in 17 Brits now working for home.
