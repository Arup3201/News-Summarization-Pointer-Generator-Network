A teenager who stole a man's car this past Friday was seen sucking on a pacifier just moments before the robbery.

Police in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma are on the lookout for an 18-year-old they have nicknamed the Binky Bandit, who has been accused of carjacking and stealing a man's wallet in the parking lot of a convenience store at around 8 pm Friday night.

'It’s something that we don’t see very often, a man who is our suspect in such a violent crime to have a pacifier but we can't forget the fact that it is a very serious crime,' Sgt. Jennifer Wardlow of the Oklahoma City Police Department told KOCO 5.

 Police also believe the teen could be on drugs, which is why he needs the pacifier.

'There are certain drugs that people use that have certain effects. One of them is them grinding their teeth.' 

The suspect apparently approached the victim in the parking lot and asked him a  few questions before pulling out a 38-caliber handgun and demanding his wallet and vehicle, a red, two-door, 1997 Grand Prix.

The victim did not resist and handed over both, allowing the suspect to quickly speed away.

A surveillance camera at the Circle L convenience store was able to capture a clear shot of the young male, who police say has a thin build and is between 5 feet 9 inches and 5 feet 11 inches tall. 

'We're confident these are clear enough photos someone out there will recognize this man and contact police and we can take him into custody,' Sgt. Wardlow told KWTV. 

Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 405-235-7300.
