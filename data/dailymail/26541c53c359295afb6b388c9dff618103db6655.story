A football fan who ran onto the pitch and took an admittedly impressive free kick has defended his actions - claiming the game was in dire need of 'livening up'.

Pitch invader Jordan Dunn, 22, who had downed five cans of lager, sprinted 80 yards across the field to take a free kick during the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham.

Dunn, from Dover in Kent, ran past the Spurs players and chipped the ball over the West Ham wall into the keeper's hands before being wrestled to the ground by Upton Park stewards. 

'It was a boring game and I livened it up,' the West Ham fan said. 'The free kick I took was better than the professional one taken afterwards.'

In trouble: This is the moment Jordan Dunn ran 80 yards across Upton Park to take a free kick during West Ham's game with Spurs on Saturday 

Not bad: Dunn managed to dink the ball over the wall but the goalkeeper managed to stop it just under the crossbar

Confused: England winger Andros Townsend watches as the soon-to-be-banned fan rushed in and took the free kick

Speaking to The Sun, he added: 'These players are on thousands of pounds every week and I'm on £7 an hour yet I do a better job.' 

Yesterday he said a potential 10-year ban from all British football grounds because of the stunt is 'definitely worth it' because 'my mates think I'm a legend'.

Despite his drunken state his effort was still better than star midfielder Christian Eriksen's, whose later attempt flew over the bar into the stands during Spurs' 1-0 win.

The 22-year-old hotel receptionist spent Saturday night in a police cell before he was charged and bailed under the Football Offences Act.

Dunn added that police officers were watching the incident online when he was taken to the station.

He said he planned to plead guilty to the offence at Thames Magistrates' Court on September 1 where he faces a fine of up to £5,000 and a 10-year ban.

But Dunn said: 'I know it was a mistake, but it was definitely worth it.

'My phone hasn't stopped going off and even Gary Lineker tweeted about it. My mates think I'm a legend.

'I could be looking at a 10-year-ban and even a £5,000 fine. The ban wouldn't bother me whatsoever but obviously the money would.

'My mum's not too happy, but she had a little laugh about it.'

Lineker tweeted: 'A fan runs on the pitch at Upton Park and takes the free kick. Made a better fist of it than Eriksen.' 

On the run: The pitch invader, who had eight pints, then carried on sprinting as a steward followed him

Caught: It took four stewards to tackle him and Dunn says it was worth it because his mates think he is a 'legend'

Right-footed Dunn, who plays for Dover Elms Vale, said he was forced to shoot with his left foot to avoid breaking his stride. 

His shot was saved by West Ham's Spanish goalkeeper Adrian.

He added: 'I thought no one else was shooting, so I might as well.

'I think I ran about 80 yards. I don't remember looking at any players - I only had my eyes on the ball.

'If I had used my right I probably would have fallen over. It wasn't a bad strike though.

'I just wish I'd used the outside of my right foot and buried it bottom corner.'
