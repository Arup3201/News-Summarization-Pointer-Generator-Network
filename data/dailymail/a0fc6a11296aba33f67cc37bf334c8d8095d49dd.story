An architect who transformed a derelict wasteland into a luxury home for just £400,000 is set to make a huge profit as the property goes on the market for £2.25 million.

Marcus Lee bought the plot in an industrial cul-de-sac next to a bicycle garage and car workshop for a reported £70,000 and spent a further £330,000 building the home - including £20,000 just on the glass for windows.

The eye-catching property has won numerous design awards since its completion in 2007. 

Mr Lee now stands to make more than five times the amount it cost to build the five-bedroom house in Hackney, east 
London, where prices have rocketed by 17 per cent in the last year 
alone.

But three five-bedroom houses are up for sale on a neighbouring street for significantly less at £899,950 - more than double the £345,000 price tag properties of the same size in the area sold for in 2007 when the 'Frame House' was built.

Mr Lee, who spent 21 years working on big projects at Richard Rogers Partnership, was involved in the design of Heathrow’s Terminal 1 and Terminal 5 while with the firm, as well as the Lloyd’s building in London.

He went on to co-found the FLACQ company and later became a director at Glenn Howells Architects and principal at Arup Associates. He said he is only selling the property so he can move on to another project.

Transformation: Architect Marcus Lee transformed a derelict plot of land into this five-bedroom property in Hackney, east London
