Varun Aaron took four wickets as India restricted a Cricket Australia Invitational XI to 243 all out on the opening day of a two-day match in preparation for the first Test against Australia.

In reply at stumps on Thursday, India were 99 for two, with opener Murali Vijay 39 not out and Virat Kohli with an unbeaten 30.

The 25-year-old Aaron has played only three Tests due to a number of injuries, but this performance could see him start when the first test begins at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday.

The right-arm paceman was the leading wicket-taker when the two sides met in a two-day match at the same Glenelg Oval in suburban Adelaide last week.

Aaron dismissed opener and captain Ashton Turner for a duck in the second over when the batsman dragged the ball on to his stumps. Tasmania opener Jordan Silk and Alex Keath put on a stand of 71 after the hosts collapsed to 34 for three.

Aaron returned to break the partnership, with Silk out edging for 58. The India quick finished with figures of 4 for 41 from 14.3 overs.

India's tour game at the Adelaide Oval last week was cancelled after Phillip Hughes' death while playing for South Australia. Cricket Australia wanted to give the visitors a replacement match before the rescheduled four-test series starts in Adelaide - the first Test had initially been due to begin on Thursday in Brisbane.

There was no toss at the start of Thursday's match, with India granted their wish of bowling first under overcast skies.

That gave Kohli, Vijay and Rohit Sharma time to return from New South Wales, where they attended Hughes' funeral and still have an opportunity to bat.

The two sides lined up for a minute's silence before play, while both sides wore black armbands to honour Hughes. 

The scoreboard carried the tribute "RIP P HUGHES 408", referring to the fact that Hughes was the 408th Test player for Australia.
