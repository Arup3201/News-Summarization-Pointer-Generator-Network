MP: Eric Joyce insisted he did not have a drinking problem today outside court, pictured

Falkirk MP Eric Joyce has said he is considering his future as a politician after he admitted calling an Afro-Caribbean baggage handler 'f****** fat and black'.

The 53-year-old, who was thrown out of the Labour party after a brawl in a House of Commons bar, was drunk by the time he landed at Edinburgh Airport and hurled abuse at staff on May 19 last year.

After he was fined £1,500 he insisted he did not have a drinking problem - but said he will 'reflect' on whether he will remain in Westminster.

The MP will not be automatically disqualified from the Commons - that is only possible if MPs are jailed for a year or more.

He had been drinking on an evening 
flight from Heathrow to the Scottish capital last May, realising later 
that he left his phone on board, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard today.

He asked airport baggage handlers for help but became abusive when they asked for flight details.

Police officers became involved, but he continued to hurl insults.

Joyce repeatedly called a baggage handler and officers 'fat, f****** w*****s' and goaded officers to 'f****** arrest me'.

He also referred to an officer of Afro-Caribbean origin as 'f****** fat and black'.

Joyce
 began to 'flail his arms' when one officer attempted to put him in 
handcuffs, and he continued to resist until he was restrained on the 
floor.

Sheriff Frank Crowe described his actions as a 'deeply unfortunate, prolonged, drink-fuelled rant'.

'At least you have taken this opportunity to apologise,' the sheriff said.

As
 well as imposing a fine, the sheriff ordered Joyce to pay £100 
compensation to airport staff and £50 to the police officer he racially 
insulted.

Outside court the 53-year-old said he will now 'reflect' on whether to continue at Westminster until the election next year.

Abuse: The MP called an Afro-Caribbean baggage handler at Edinburgh Airport 'f****** fat and black'

'My instinct is to stay but I don't know how I will feel in a few days,' he said outside court.

'I am very embarrassed that this has happened... My constituents have seen this before, so they might think other apologies are not meant, but they are.'

Asked if he had a problem with alcohol, Joyce said: 'I think I am well past that now.'

Defence lawyer Euan Gosney told the court Joyce was in a 'high state of anxiety' because of the recent death of his brother and previous trouble with police.

'He accepts that he allowed this baggage to get on top of him, to get the better of him,' he said.

'When he was faced with what he perceived to be a lack of assistance, he allowed himself to become emotional, to overreact, to become abusive.'

Mr Gosney added: 'A conviction of this nature will inevitably make a return to any form of public life difficult, if not impossible.'

Apology: The MP's lawyer told the court he was under strain at the time and was sorry for his actions

Joyce became an independent MP after he was expelled from the Labour Party following his conviction for assaulting politicians in a House of Commons bar in 2012.

The former Army major was fined £3,000 and banned from pubs for three months following the brawl in the Strangers' Bar.

Joyce's arrival at Westminster in 2000 came shortly after he quit the Army, making claims of snobbery, sexism and racism in the armed forces.

He was elected to Parliament as Labour MP for Falkirk West in a by-election.

He increased his majority in the general elections of 2001 and 2005 when the constituency was renamed Falkirk after constituency changes, and held on by a comfortable margin in 2010.

The selection of his replacement as Labour candidate in Falkirk became emroiled in a major scandal amid claims of vote-rigging.
