The second teenager accused of brutally killing a 16-year-old West Virginia girl because she no longer wanted to be her friend will be tried as an adult.

Sheila Eddy, 16, was identified Wednesday by prosecutors as the second teen that lured Skylar Neese to a remote wooded area to stab her to death July 6, 2012 to avoid being her friend.

Investigators found Ms Eddy's body six months after the horrific slaying, but only after Ms Shoaf confessed to the brutal murder. She has since pleaded guilty as part of a deal with prosecutors and is awaiting sentencing.

Cold blooded? Shelia Eddy, 16, pleaded not guilty to first degree murder and will be tried as an adult

Tragic: Police chased numerous leads in trying to find Neese with no luck. Until Shoaf came forward

Ms Eddy will likely plead not guilty and head to trial, according to prosecutors, much to the disappointment of the slain girl's father.

'I don't want to hear the grisly details of how Skylar was murdered,' Dave Neese said. 'I don't want to hear how she screamed and cried. But I do want these girls to get what they deserve.'

Proceedings will be held in open court going forward, prosecutors announced this week.

She even helped in the search: Ms Eddy acted like she was sad the girl she allegedly killed was missing, even helping to look for her

Prosecutors have said they will recommend Ms Shoaf receive a 20-year sentence, but the confessed killer faces as much as 40 years behind bars.

Court documents offer no insight into the motive for the crime. On May 1, Skylar's father said the only reason he could think of was that they 'didn't like her any more.'

WDTV reported that Dave Neese stated: 'They didn't like her anymore. That's the only response I got.

'I want a reason, I want some kind of reason (for this to) happen. There is no reason I don't care if you have the best reason in the world, but there's no reason (for this to happen).'

What went wrong?: The three girls were said to be inseparable friends before Neese was stabbed to death because the two teens allegedly no longer liked her

Neese added of Rachel Shoaf: 'I feel bad for your parents and I hope you rot in hell.'

The victim was last seen on surveillance video leaving her family's apartment voluntarily and getting into a car on July 6, 2012.

She was initially considered a runaway, but her parents soon suspected she was abducted.

Police chased numerous leads with no luck. The break finally came when Shoaf admitted plotting with another girl to kill her – shocking even the investigators working the case.

Skylar Neese disappeared in July 2012 and was initially thought to be a runaway but her parents soon suspected she had been abducted

The two girls were charged with 
luring the straight-A student at University High School out of her 
family's apartment in the middle of the night, stabbing her to death at 
an agreed-upon moment and hiding her body under branches in a 
Pennsylvania township about 30 miles away from her house, according to 
court documents.

The pair had spent time with Neese's mother after the slaying and even helped with the search.

The cold calculation and brutality of
 the plot shocked a community already frustrated by the slow pace and 
secrecy surrounding the case.

Charged: Rachel Shoaf, of Morgantown, pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Skylar Neese and she awaits sentencing in a juvenile detention center

Investigators have said little since announcing the charges three weeks ago.

People sit in the chairs at John's 
Barber Shop, gaze at Neese's photo on a bulletin board and wonder: How 
could anyone so young plot to kill a classmate and friend?

'They look as normal as any other kid
 that you could ever see,' said barber BJ McClead. 'Not kids you would 
think would have anything to do with anything like this.'

The other girl's identity is, for now, shrouded by the confidentiality of juvenile court.

Though McClead says most people in town have figured out who it is, it's unclear how long the three girls had been friends or just how close they were.

It's also unclear whether prosecutors will try to have the second suspect charged as an adult, as Shoaf was.

'People are confused. They're like, "What is taking so long?"' said McClead, whose daughter Hayden had been friends with Neese since junior high.

'It's ridiculous. Who's protecting these girls?' said the barber, who still hands out red-and-yellow bracelets bearing the victim's name.

'Three families' lives are now ruined because of this heinous crime that these girls committed.'

Monongalia County Prosecutor Marcia Ashdown has refused to return repeated calls seeking comment.

The mystery began last July when Neese climbed out of her bedroom window. 

Surveillance video showed her getting
 into a car at the end of her street in a quiet residential neighborhood
 near West Virginia University.

With no sign of fear, no money and no contact lenses, she apparently expected to return.

Shock: In Star City, West Virginia, the community was shaken. Barber BJ McClead (pictured) said of the accused: 'They look as normal as any other kid that you could ever see.'

When
 she didn't, Dave and Mary Neese worried. Police initially suspected 
their daughter was a runaway, but they knew better. They walked up and 
down Crawford Street with Neese's photo, then plastered fliers 
everywhere.

'You couldn't go 5 feet without seeing her,' said 24-year-old Brittany Crouse, who moved in around the time of the disappearance. 'Everybody really, really wanted her to come home.'

For months, police chased down tips to no avail. The transcript from Shoaf's hearing shows the break came January 3, when she finally told investigators the truth - and where to find the body.

But it wasn't until March that authorities confirmed it was Neese, and silence followed until the day of the plea hearing.

'I think police who were involved in the front lines of that interview and that part of the investigation were stunned at Rachel Shoaf's confession,' Ashdown told Judge Russell Clawges that day.

'She confessed to a plan and conspiracy with another juvenile to kill Skylar Neese. A plan carried out.'

The three girls drove to Wayne Township, Pa., got out of the car and the suspects pretended to socialize with Neese.

'And, at a planned and agreed upon moment,' Ashdown said, the girls 'attacked and stabbed Skylar to death, and they left her there.'

They tried to bury Neese, she said, but covered her with branches when they couldn't.

In
 the five-page court file on Shoaf, prosecutors say they plan to 
recommend a 20-year prison sentence. But she could get as many as 40 
years under the law.

Mystery: People in the small West Virginia town had wondered for months about Skylar Neese. She vanished after slipping out the bedroom of her Star City home in July 2012

Shoaf's family issued a public apology through a lawyer but has made no further statements.

'There is no way to describe the pain that we, too, are feeling,' they said.

'We are truly sorry for the pain that she has caused the Neese family, and we know her actions are unforgivable and inexcusable.

'Our daughter has admitted her involvement and she has accepted responsibility for her actions.

'Our hearts are broken for your loss,' they told the Neese family, 'and we are still trying to come to terms with this event.'

Mary Neese has declined interview requests. But the family has tried to spare others their agony, persuading legislators to pass 'Skylar's Law' earlier this year.

Under the law, Amber Alerts are no longer limited to kidnappings in West Virginia. Even when authorities suspect a child is a runaway, information is turned over to Amber Alert officials.

The transcript of Shoaf's hearing shows other students also had suspicions, chattering on social media about all three girls.

A few overheard a conversation between the suspects about the plot but waited to report it.

The teenagers thought it was a joke, Ashdown told the judge, 'but only later decided and believed it was all too true and all too prophetic.'

McClead marvels that two teenage girls could maintain their deception from July to January. 'Some of the criminals that are locked up for life aren't that hard.'
