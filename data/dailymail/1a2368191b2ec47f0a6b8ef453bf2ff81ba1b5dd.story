Birds develop different 'accents' in their song depending on where they live, scientists said.

A study of 723 male chaffinches in twelve different populations across the European mainland, the Azores and the Canaries found their notes became more unpredictable the further they moved.

U.S. researchers believe that one reason, along with more mystifying ones, may be that island birds face less competition.

Birds develop different 'accents' in their song depending on where they live, scientists said. A study of 723 male chaffinches in twelve different populations across the European mainland, the Azores and the Canaries found their notes became more unpredictable the further they moved

Whereas a female may be attempting to 
pick out the right male among 60 other species singing all at once in 
Europe, in the Azores she faces just eight others.

The males are the singers and biologist Robert Lachlan, of Duke University, North Carolina, said: ‘One of the jobs the female has is to identify her own species.’

He compared the songs using a computer and discovered that the pattern of the notes, which he calls 'syllables', lost their syntax on the mid-Atlantic archipelago which the birds have colonised over half a million years.

The research found the chaffinches living in Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands, still sing the same notes, but with a much less structured pattern from one bird to the next.

Dr Lachlan said: ‘A chaffinch from mainland Europe always sounds like a chaffinch from mainland Europe.'

But on Gran Canaria, it is much harder for a human to pick them out by hearing alone.

The study, published in the journal Current Biology, found the syntax was gradually lost step-by-step matching the known dispersal of the species.

U.S. researchers believe island chaffinches (pictured right next to a greenfinch) face less competition than their friends on the European mainland. Whereas a female may be attempting to pick out the right male among 60 other species singing all at once in Europe, in the Azores she faces just eight others

At the end of the island chain, it ‘is not just changing, it is disappearing,’ Dr Lachlan said.

‘It is not about changing the rules, it is about losing them.’

There are almost twice as many species on the Canary Islands as on the Azores, yet the Canary Island songs have much less structure, leading Dr Lachlan to say that 'other factors must also be involved.’

A large body of research has shown birds learn their species-specific song from their elders.

The research found the chaffinches living in Gran Canaria (pictured) in the Canary Islands, still sing the same notes, but with a much less structured pattern from one bird to the next

But if cultural transmission were the only source of syntax, one would expect songs from the smaller island populations to have more than those from the mainland, Dr Lachlan said.

Yet there is also a genetic component to that learning. Hundreds of genes have been identified which relate to song learning and singing.

Studies show young birds have a genetic predisposition helping them pick out which songs they ought to be learning in order to develop typical songs.

Dr Lachlan said: ‘It appears very likely what we measured is the result of the evolution of such genes.’

He believes one of two plausible explanations may be something called a ‘cultural trap’.

‘In small populations, like those on islands shortly after colonisation, an evolutionary interaction between culture and genetic predisposition favours individuals that can recognise and learn a wider range of songs - in this case, a wider range of syntactical patterns,’ he added.

It may also be a case of ‘withdrawal of learning’.

When populations are very small on the new island, young birds may find few tutors to learn from.

Some would be forced to improvise, and this would introduce new songs into the at a higher rate than normal, leading to rapid change in structure.

Now he has established this pattern of syntax loss across the islands, Dr Lachlan hopes to use it to investigate the causes of song learning evolution.
