One of Australia's most decorated Olympians is returning to TV after overcoming a drug addiction.

Grant Hackett will put the past year's troubles behind him, including a stint in rehab after he became hooked on the sleeping drug Stilnox, to co-host Channel Nine's Wide World of Sports.

The 34-year-old will be back on the box next Sunday, alongside former cricketer Michael Slater.

'We both thought it was time he came back... he was raring to go,' Nine's head of sport Steve Crawley told Daily Mail Australia.

Back in action: Grant Hackett is returning to TV after overcoming a drug addiction

Crawley said he stayed in touch with Hackett 'even when he was away in America' in rehab and says it wasn't a case of if he would return to the channel but when.

'In difficult times, that's when it's important to think about people you care for,' Crawley said about his and Nine's close relationship with the gold-medalist, who he described as a 'great talent'.

'I rang Grant and he rang me back last week,' he said, explaining that it was an easy process to get him back on the box.

Hackett will become part of the Sunday sport show's regular cycle of co-hosts, who appear alongside regular Ken Sutcliffe.

And Crawley is already eyeing up Hackett for Nine's Commonwealth Games coverage from Glasgow, Scotland.

'It will be great to have him in the Commonwealth Games. Once we get next week out the way we'll look into,' he said.

'He's part of the show, he's part of the family. It sounds like a cliche but its true.'

The Commonwealth Games kick off on the 23 July.

Hackett first joined Channel Nine in October 2008, as Nine News Melbourne's weekend sport presenter, replacing Heath Oâ€™Loughlin, and went on to appear on numerous shows for the network.

In May, the former swimmer returned to work as an executive at Australia's largest bank, Westpac, a month after he completed a 35-day rehabilitation programme at a US clinic for his addiction.

Hackett boarded a flight to America in February to attend the clinic, just days after a bizarre incident in which he was photographer half-naked in the middle of the night in the foyer of Melbourne's Crown Casino.

The father of two young children was seen carrying his daughter on his hip while he searched for his son.

The incident prompted an intervention by his mother, Margaret, and father Neville, a retired policeman, who insisted their son travel to America for rehabilitation.

Divorced: The Olympian's troubles came after his divorce from Australian singer Candice Alley in August 2013

Following his successful five-week treatment, Hackett flew to his parents' home on the Gold Coast.

The swimmer told Channel Nine News before boarding the plane home he was 'feeling a lot better'.

'It just gets to a situation in life where you're not coping too well and you need to put your hand up and ask for help,' he said in Los Angeles.

His troubles came after his divorce from Australian singer Candice Alley in August 2013.
