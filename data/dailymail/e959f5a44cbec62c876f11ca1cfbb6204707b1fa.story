A 33-year-old man has been shot dead by two police officers after he brandished a knife in front of them. 

The suspect reportedly lunged at two male Queensland Police officers with a weapon when they visited the house north of Brisbane.

A police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that police shot because 'the man had a knife' and confirmed two shots were fired.

The incident occurred just after midnight on Monday night.

The man was from the suburb of Deception Bay, north of Brisbane, about a 15 minute drive from the house where he was shot.

The man's flatmate, Adam Sant, says he tried to stop him.
