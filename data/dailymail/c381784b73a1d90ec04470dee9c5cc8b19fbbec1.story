Spending her 29th birthday surrounded by her seven children is a particularly poignant moment for Carrie McArthur - whose whole family was wiped out by a fire when she was a schoolgirl.

Carrie vowed to surround herself with a large loving family after she was the only survivor of the fierce blaze at her home in May 1992 when she was just eight.

Her mother Susan was 28 when schoolgirl Carrie lost her two sisters and brother in the inferno at their home in Kidwelly, near Swansea.

Carrie McArthur, who lost her family in a fire, now has seven children of her own. She is pictured here with (from left) Cody McArthur-King age six, Brandon McArthur-King age nine, Lucas Hawkins age five months, Lewis McArthur age four, Harley Mcarthur-King age seven and Tianna McArthur age five

Carrie only survived because a brave paramedic battled through the intense heat and smoke to reach her bedroom and lift her to safety

Carrie - who suffered serious burns but escaped with her life - said: 'I lost the four people I was closest to - I was only eight and they were gone for ever.

'I can’t replace them but I have been lucky to have my children and they are everything to me.'

Carrie is full-time mum to Thomas, nine, Brendan, eight, Harley, seven, Cody, six, Tianna, five, Lewis, four, and six-month-old baby Lucas.

She said: 'I am raising them to appreciate what they have in life they are lucky to have.

'I will say to them: 'Don’t take things for granted because you don’t know what is around the corner.'

'I will teach them to treasure every day and cherish the family around you.'

Carrie was in bed at 9.20pm when the inferno ripped through the family home in the village of Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire.

Her mother Susan, 28, sisters Christine, nine, and Adele, and eight and brother Robert, five, all perished.

Carrie only survived because a brave paramedic battled through the intense heat and smoke to reach her bedroom - and lift her to safety.

But she was left with 90 per cent burns and underwent more than 70 painful skin grafts.

When she was well enough Carrie returned to school but had to face daily taunts from cruel playground bullies.

Carrie said: 'They teased me about my scars, they used to say they could cook an egg on my face.

'But I remember looking in the mirror - I thought I looked like an alien. It was difficult, but I was glad that I was alive.

'Sometimes people would call me Scarface. I used to get called a lot of different things.

'Words are just words, but they do hurt. I used to cry all the time. I would just walk off crying.

'There is nothing you can do when six or seven people are shouting names at you.

'I wouldn’t have fought anyway, I can’t fight.'

Carrie was protected by her father Thomas who had split from her mum and was not in the house on the night of the inferno.

But Thomas tragically died of heart failure at the age of 50 on the 20th anniversary of the fire - leaving Carrie with no one from her own family left.

And although she was grief-stricken at losing the last link with her parents and siblings Carrie has taken comfort from her own big family.

She said: 'The children are my life - having seven little ones is a handful sometimes but I wouldn’t have it any other way.

'My dad used to say: 'I think mum’s looking down on you and the children, proud as punch.

'Now I feel as if both of them are up there as my guiding lights.'

Carrie, who is scarred the length of her body and she has no toes on her left foot, had the last of her skin graft operations four years ago.

She said: 'The scars are on my back, my front, my legs, my arms, my head.

'But they have made me the person I am today. I am strong.'

The blaze left Carrie with a fear of fire and when Bonfire night comes around the family stays at home indoors.

Carrie said: 'I have never lit a match. I’m too scared. What happens if it drops? I couldn’t do it.

'You won’t catch me lighting a firework for the children, even sparklers are a no go area.'

Carrie
 split from the father of her first six children - and the latest of her
 brood, baby Lucas, came along after she started a new relationship.

The mum-of-seven is now studying health and social studies at a local college to get a career as her children grow up.

She said: 'I want to be a nurse. I have spent most of my life in and out of hospital and I would like to give something back.

'I am trying to make the best of my life and I want my children to have what I didn’t.

'I’m the same age as my mum when she died and I look at our life as a family. I’m so grateful.

'I grew up without my mum around so I always remind my kids how lucky they are to have a loving mother.

'I hope they grow up grateful for what they have because family really is the most important thing.'
