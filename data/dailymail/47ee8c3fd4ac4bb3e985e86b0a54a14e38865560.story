Astronomers are tonight anticipating the skies to light up with one of the world’s most incredible meteor showers.

The Eta Aquarid shower will peak late tonight and before dawn on Tuesday with stunning views expected all over the world.

Star gazers in the southern hemisphere will have the best seats for the show with astronomers predicting 30 to 40 meteors to streak through the skies every hour.

The Eta Aquarid meteor shower is due to peak tonight, but will be visible in the night sky through to 7 May.

Comet of Origin: 1P Halley

Radiant: Constellation Aquarius

Active: 19 April - 28 May 2014

Peak activity: 5 - 6 May 2014

Peak activity meteor count: Around 45 meteors per hour

Meteor velocity: 44 miles (66 km) per second

Where to see it: Anywhere away from bright city lights. However, people in the southern hemisphere will have the best views.

What time: In the early mornings, right before dawn. Nasa suggests trying to see the show between 3am and 5am your local time.

Northerners might spy 5-10 meteors per hour over the next few mornings, with the best time to see the shower between 3am and 5am your local time.

Nasa claims that some Eta Aquarid meteors may also be visible for a few days after 6 May, due to the shower's broad peak period.

‘What makes this shower somewhat special is that the meteors stem from the most famous comet in all of history, Comet Halley,’ said Slooh astronomer Bob Berman.

‘As Halley goes around the sun in its 76-year orbit, pieces of it, little chunks of ice, slough off the comet and we intersect that every year around this time, in early May.’

Halley's Comet returns to Earth's vicinity approximately every 75 years, so some people could see it twice in their lifetime.

The last time it was here was in 1986, and it is projected to return in 2061.

The
 comet is named after English astronomer Edmond Halley, who examined 
reports of a comet approaching Earth in 1531, 1607 and 1682.

Halley's most famous appearance occurred shortly before the 1066 invasion of England by William the Conquerer.

It is said that William felt the comet heralded his success. The comet was put on the Bayeux Tapestry as a result.

Eta Aquarid meteors are known for their speed travelling at 148,000 mph (66 km/s).

Fast meteors can leave glowing ‘trains’ of incandescent debris which last for several seconds to minutes.

In the Northern Hemisphere, Eta Aquarid meteors can be seen as ‘earthgrazers.’ These are long meteors that appear to skim the surface of the Earth at the horizon.

To view the Eta Aquarids, Nasa suggests finding an area well away from city or street lights, prepared with a sleeping bag, blanket or chair.

‘Lie flat on your back with your feet facing east and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible,’ the space agency advises.

‘After about 30 minutes in the dark, your eyes will adapt and you will begin to see meteors. Be patient - the show will last until dawn, so you have plenty of time to catch a glimpse.’

Meteors come from leftover comet particles and bits of broken asteroids. When comets come around the sun, they leave a dusty trail behind them.

Every year the Earth passes through these debris trails, which allows the bits to collide with our atmosphere where they disintegrate to create fiery and colourful streaks in the sky.

A Nasa fireball camera at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama caught these Eta Aquarid meteors in flight.  Eta Aquarid meteors are known for their speed and can travel at 148,000 mph (66 km/s)

The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Eta Aquarid originate from comet 1P/Halley.

Each time that Halley returns to the inner solar system its nucleus sheds a layer of ice and rock into space.

The dust grains eventually become the Eta Aquarids in May and the Orionids in October if they collide with Earth's atmosphere.

Comet Halley takes about 76 years to orbit the sun once. The last time comet Halley was seen from the Earth was in 1986. Comet Halley will not enter the inner solar system again until 2061.
