When the Duchess of Cambridge joined the Royal Family for the Christmas Day service at Sandringham, she wore a coat that was warm, stylish… and thoroughly out of date.

Thousands of fashion fans were frustrated to find that Kate’s ‘new’ £685 double-breasted Turpin coat by British label Moloh has not been available to buy for at least two years.

And it’s not the first time.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal ‘hoarding’ is now a deliberate strategy by the Duchess, who is keen to avoid causing fashion stampedes or, perhaps, coming face-to-face with women in the same outfit. So she often waits months, or even years, before wearing purchases.

Kate, who is a size eight, usually takes pieces ‘on approval’. She does not inform the designers when – or if – she will be wearing their outfits and pays only once she has worn them. 

Last night Moloh owner Caroline Smiley said: ‘I’m sure she likes the idea that things aren’t still in the shops when she wears them.’
