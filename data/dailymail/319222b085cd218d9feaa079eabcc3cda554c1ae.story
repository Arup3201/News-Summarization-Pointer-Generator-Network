A gypsy teen was gored to death in a running-of-the-bulls style fiesta in a small Spanish town last night.

The 16-year-old boy, named only by his initials JSM, was with hundreds of other revellers celebrating the Apostle James feast in the small town of Isso when tragedy struck.

Running away from the 500kg beast, he was caught off guard and tripped over.

The bull's horn pierced through his lower back, stabbing into his liver - causing 'copious amounts of blood' to spurt out, reports local media.

Shocked onlookers dragged him away from the animal so paramedics could attend to his injuries.

But they immediately decided he was in a critical condition and rushed him, at 7.10pm, via ambulance to the area hospital in the nearby town of Hellin.

Doctors performed two emergency operations as they fought to save his life.

The bull attacked the boy in the town of Isso during a Spanish festival. The town council announced it would be cancelling today's run in tribute to the teen

He went into cardiac arrest at 10pm and died. Another man was also gored at the dangerous event. 

The 52-year-old was thrown into the air after being hit in his left thigh.

Taken to the same hospital, doctors managed to save his leg and he is now said to be 'recovering well' and 'out of danger'.

A spokesman for the town's council revealed it would be cancelling today's run in tribute to the teen.

The fiestas for the town that lies 200 miles southeast of Madrid started last weekend and were due to end today. 

With security almost non-existent at small town bull runs, it means almost anyone - even if they are drunk, unfit or too young - can take part.
