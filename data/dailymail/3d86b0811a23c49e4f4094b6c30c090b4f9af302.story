Kris Marshall may be best known as the former BT spokesperson - or as the love-lorn Colin in everyone's favourite film, Love Actually - but it's the 41-year-old actor's current starring role on BBC drama, Death in Paradise, that's truly one to watch.

While we count down to the start of appropriate Love Actually viewing season, Tamara Hinson checks in with Somerset native for a confessional chat about everything from his naughtiest holiday memory to the most unusual thing he's ever eaten abroad.

So where does TV's Caribbean-dwelling detective really consider to be absolutely idyllic? Read on...

Kris Marshall, of Love Actually and Death in Paradise, reveals his best and worst travel moments

Earliest holiday memory?

When I was three and living in Canada, we drove down to Disneyworld — a long way.

Last destination you visited?

We get a week off in the middle of shooting Death In Paradise so I decamped to Antigua (the next island) with my family.

Favourite place?

The UK. When you travel the world you realise we live in a beautiful country with a generally fair society.

Worst ever holiday experience?

Contracting a Congolese parasite while filming Oka.

Kris and his family most recently visited Antigua, during his week off from filming Death in Paradise

What do you miss the most when you’re abroad?

My wife and son.

What’s your biggest travel-related confession?

I have an outstanding speeding fine in Switzerland. I’m scared to go back.

Where’s the MOST romantic place you’ve ever been to, and why?

Cornwall. Beautiful, desolate and haunting.

What’s the most unusual thing you’ve ever eaten?

Pigeon in Hong Kong. I was invited to the home of someone I was working with and they even ate the heads.

What’s the naughtiest thing you’ve done on holiday?

I had my car stolen while it was being fixed at a garage in the UK. They gave me a hire car while they worked out what to do — a Skoda! I was incensed so decided to take it on a little road trip. To Morocco.

What’s one place you’ve got absolutely no desire to visit?

Dubai.
