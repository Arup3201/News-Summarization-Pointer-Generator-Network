 A kindergarten teacher who had sex with a 16-year-old friend of her daughter's has been jailed for six years.

Cynthia Lynn Herr was also told she will be on probation for nine years after she has completed her sentence and must surrender her teaching certificate.

The 36-year-old wept in court Brooksville, Florida, after pleading guilty under a plea deal that spared her being jailed for up to 45 years.

Cynthia Lynn Herr wept in court as she was sentenced to six years in prison for having sex with a boy, 16. She will also have to serve probation when she leaves prison and lost her teaching certificate. She is married and has two children. The victim was a friend of her daughter

The parents of her teen victim approved the six-year sentence.

Herr admitted to taking the teen to a hotel last September where they had sex four times during the day.

She told a co-worker at the JD Floyd K8 school in Spring Hill, Florida, where she worked about the sexual liaison.

The co-worker tipped off school authorities and police launched an investigation.

The teen, who was a friend of her daughter's, initially denied having sex but after police checked his Facebook and cell phone discovered messages of a sexual nature.

The messages also appeared to talk about the sex they had together.

The teen later admitted that they had sex at a Weeki Wachee hotel on August 24.

He said they had sex in Herr's van in Pasco and Marion counties.

According to an arrest report in September 2013, Herr told investigators she knew that what she did was wrong and that she probably would lose her family and job and go to jail.

She also allegedly said she would be in trouble if authorities were to access her phone and Facebook account.

After her arrest Herr, who is married with two children, was resigned from her job as a prekindergarten exceptional student education teacher.

Herr was charged with four counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor.

She pleaded guilty to all four counts as part of the plea deal
