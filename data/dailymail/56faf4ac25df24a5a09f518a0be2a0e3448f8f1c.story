A man whose nose was bitten off by a vicious dog said he 'wants justice' after authorities failed to destroy the animal.

Jimmy Rogers, 23, has been left with a gaping hole on his face after the dog turned on him and ripped out the bridge of his nose.

The three-year-old dog is believed to be a cross between a pit bull and an American bulldog; pit bull-type dogs are banned in Ontario, where the attack happened.

Jimmy Rogers has been left with a gaping hole in his face after a vicious dog ripped the bridge of his nose off as he sat in his front porch

The unemployed construction worker, from Oshawa, on Lake Ontario, Canada, told the Toronto Sun: 'I want justice. My nose has been ripped off and I don’t want this to happen to someone else.'

Jimmy was relaxing in the front porch of his home with his girlfriend Sjaana Farrant, 23, when the attack happened.

The un-muzzed dog, named Polo, belonged to his neighbour's brother. As they walked past Jimmy's porch, Polo suddenly turned on him and launched itself at his head.

To protect his girlfriend, Jimmy grabbed the dog but the animal bit down on his dose, tearing away the bridge. This is the last thing Jimmy remembers about the attack.

Surgeons had to take a skin graft from Jimmy's leg to cover the open wound where his nose used to be. Part of his nostrils have been saved, but it will take more operations to rebuild his nose using bone taken from his wrist.

Traumatised after the harrowing ordeal, Jimmy has spoken out about what he says is a lax enforcement of Ontario's ban on pit bulls.

He told the Toronto Sun that Oshawa authorities were failing to take Ontario's pit bull ban seriously; he claimed the dog should be destroyed.

Animal services in Oshawa seized the dog after the attack, but according to the local news service, it will be released within the week with nothing more than a muzzle order.

Ontario's laws ban pit bulls, which includes: pit bull terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers, American pit bull terriers, or 'a dog that has an appearance and physical characteristics substantially similar to any of those dogs'.

Quoted in the article, Bill Slute, animal services manager, says Polo was registered as an American Bulldog.
