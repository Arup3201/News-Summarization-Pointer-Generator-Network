Chelsea fans are no strangers to watching their team's young talents get farmed out on loan to various corners of the world, but the curious case of Gael Kakuta is one that has left the Blues faithful with a few raised eyebrows.

Once labelled the next Zinedine Zidane, Kakuta was so sought after in 2007 that Chelsea risked a FIFA transfer ban to acquire the Frenchman's signature.

The west London club were close to being banned from signing new players for two transfer windows in 2009 after FC Lens claimed Chelsea illegally induced the French-youth team player to join Chelsea.

Luckily for the Blues, Lens agreed to drop the complaint after being paid a fee of around £1million for Kakuta.

It's now been three years and eight months since Kakuta has made a senior appearance for Chelsea to add to his just six Premier League showings in a blue shirt, which is a figure that looks less and less likely to increase as the former Lens youngster embarks on his sixth loan move.

The 23-year-old has now been shipped out to Fulham, Bolton, Dijon, Vitesse, Lazio and Rayo Vallecano but not one club has been impressed enough to enquire about a long-term deal for Kakuta.

Risk: Kakuta signed for Chelsea in 2007 from Lens in a move that was shrouded in controversy 

Former Leeds United prodigies Tom Taiwo and Michael Woods are further example of Chelsea's youth development system going awry.

The pair moved to the Blues in 2006 in another highly controversial transfer after former Chelsea chairman Ken Bates accused his old side of 'tapping up' the talented duo.

Chelsea were eventually ordered to pay £5million in compensation to the Yorkshire outfit for two players that failed to make the grade having been given little chance to impress.

Taiwo didn't make a single appearance for the Chelsea first team while Woods made a handful of substitute appearances before moving on.    

Although Chelsea's managerial merry-go-round over the last six years won't have helped Kakuta's cause, there is clearly underlying issues whether its his attitude or lack of attitude at the top level.

Kakuta isn't the first and is unlikely to be the last promising youngster to fall foul of Chelsea's loan system, with 26 players currently plying their trade away from Stamford Bridge.

21-year-old midfielder Josh McEachran looks to be another Blues youngster that has failed to fit in after a bright start in the Chelsea first team set-up.

McEachran blossomed under Carlo Ancelotti in 2010, but failed to gain similar trust from other Chelsea managers since the Italian's sacking in 2011.

If he could have his time again, Kakuta may wish that he could start again with Jose Mourinho at a time in which the Chelsea boss looks keen to give opportunities to the current crop of Stamford Bridge youngsters.

The Frenchman may have been over land and sea in an attempt to prove himself in different colours, but his time at Chelsea looks all but over.
