A woman died on the operating table during an operation to ensure she would never have children.

Bianca Atherton was born with a genetic disability and had taken the decision not to have children, fearing they would be born with her condition.

She was diagnosed with a chromosomal abnormality, causing her to suffer learning disabilities.  

As a result the 27-year-old, from Horwich, Greater Manchester, opted to be sterilised.

But it was during the operation that the badminton player suffered an 'extraordinarily rare' response to her treatment.

Bianca Atherton, 27, from Horwich, died during an operation to sterilise her, after taking the decision to never have children, fearing she would pass on a genetic disability she suffered

Miss Atherton, pictured  with her partner Ashley Stringfellow, was born with a chromonsonal abnormality, leaving her with learning difficulties. She was due to play badminton for GB at this year's Special Olympics

As surgeons inflated her abdomen with gas, her heart rate plummeted.

She died as doctors at the Bolton Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester attempted to revive her.

An inquest heard the risk of death in laparoscopic or keyhole sterilisation was one in 100,000. 

Miss Atherton, a badminton player who was due to represent Great Britain in this year's Special Olympics, had a chromosomal abnormality affecting chromosome 15.

Chromosomes are the structures that hold our genes, which dictate how our bodies develop and function. 

An abnormality is when a person has an extra, missing or irregular portion of chromosomal DNA.

The most common  is Down's syndrome, which also causes learning disabilities as well as heart defects.

Where people suffer chromosomal abnormalities they are often diagnosed with learning disabilities.

The hearing was told Miss Atherton did not want children, and had several consultations with specialists to discuss the possible complications that could arise from the surgery.

Risk of death was not mentioned to her, because it was so rare, the inquest was told. 

In a statement read at the hearing, her mother Catherine Atherton, said: 'Bianca and Ashley had their ups and down but they always sorted it out. 

'They both loved football and bingo. 

'In 2011 whilst watching Ashley football Bianca started talking to a transition worker and talked about Badminton.

'She started to play in competition and in 2011 and 2013 she won a silver at the Four Nations and also a silver and bronze at the National Summer Games in Bath. It was such an achievement. 

'She had done a lot of research on the subject of sterilisation before the procedure and insisted she wanted it done. 

'She was not aware of the risk of death and there was no mention that this was a risk.'

On April 16 Mrs Atherton dropped her daughter off at the hospital before heading home.

She added: 'Once I got in the car I felt uneasy. I phoned a friend who is a nurse and she assured me they would be good with Bianca as they are trained. 

'Bianca called home at 4pm and she seemed a bit bored but her normal self. I told her "good luck". 

As surgeons performed the operation at the Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester, inflating her abdomen for the laparoscopic (keyhole) procedure, Miss Atherton's heart rate plummeted to fatal levels

'She said not to say that as it made her nervous.

'At 5.10pm I received a call from the matron and she said Bianca had had a reaction and could I get there as soon as possible. 

'We arrived and were shown to a room and told she had had a reaction and her heart had stopped but they had got it going but it was very weak.'

A vasovagal respsonse is a reflex of the involuntary nervous system that causes the heart to slow down.

At the same time it affects the nerves to the blood vessels in the legs, permitting them to widen or dilate.

As a result the heart puts out less blood, the blood pressure drops, and what blood is circulating tends to go to the legs rather than to the head.

The brain is deprived of oxygen and the sufferer faints.

In extreme cases the heart rate can drop to fatal levels.

During the procedure Miss Atherton suffered a common reaction to the procedure, known as the 'vasovagal response' in which her abdomen was inflated with gas causing her heart rate to drop. 

The inquest heard most patients' heart rate rises after medication is administered but Miss Atherton's heart continued to drop, before it finally stopped.

Doctors described it as an 'extremely rare' event that none of them had experienced. 

Mrs Atherton said: 'I asked to see her but the staff were still working on her and that I could as soon as they stabilised her. 

'One of the doctors told me as soon as they had put the gas in to inflate her stomach Bianca's heart rate went from 78 to 20 and then it stopped.'

The doctors pulled out the equipment used to inflate Miss Atherton's stomach, and immediately started CPR.

They tried to revive her but her heart had not been beating for 20 minutes.

Her mother recalled: 'We were asked at this point to contact any family we needed to. 

'Sadly our beautiful daughter passed away before they arrived with her dad and I in the room. 

'As a family we are devastated by the loss of our beautiful daughter, sister and granddaughter who would make us laugh smile and feel so proud of her.'

The inquest heard doctors had not warned Miss Atherton, pictured with X-Factor winner Alexandra Burke, of the risk of death associated with the operation because it was so rare, affecting one in 100,000 cases 

Chromonsomes are the structures that hold our genes.

Genes are the individual instructions, telling our bodies how to develop and function.

They govern a person's physical and medical make-up, including hair colour, blood type and susceptibility to disease.

Chromosomes are found in every cell in the body. 

People normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs.

Two copies of chromosome 15 are inherited, one from each parent, to form the pair.

Chromsome 15 spans more than 102 million DNA building blocks and represents more than three per cent of the total DNA in cells.

It is thought to contain 600 to 700 genes that provide instructions for making proteins.

There are a number of conditions linked to changes in chromosome 15.

An abnormality of the chromosome can cause:

Dr Sangeeta Das, consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at the Royal Bolton Hospital told the inquest: 'Bianca knew about her condition and had been told it would pass down to her offspring and she didn't, in any circumstances, want it to be passed on.

'She was not in a position to take care of children by herself and she didn't want her mum looking after her and her children. 

'She was clear in her mind. She had made an intelligent thought through decision.'

He added: 'The risk of death on laparoscopic surgery is extremely rare in a minor procedure. 

'There is a risk of death with any surgery but the risk was so small here we did not discuss it. I think it is around one in 100,000 for laparoscopic surgery.'

Dr Emma Wheatley, an anaesthetist who  investigates unexpected deaths, said: 'I myself have never seen a patient who has not recovered from the vasovagal response.

'I have spoken to cardiologists who have never seen it. It is safer than driving on the motorway.'

Recording a narrative verdict Bolton coroner, Jennifer Leeming said: 'In my view Bianca died as a consequence of a recognised but rare complication of a laparoscopic procedure.

'Bianca came over as a charming, intelligent thoughtful person. 

'Her achievements that we heard about given her difficulties demand the most profound respect.' 

In a statement Bianca's coach David Gillespie said: 'Bianca was a dedicated, enthusiastic and eloquent athlete, who trained regularly, always enjoyed playing Badminton and was looking forward to competing at the 2014 European Summer Games.' 

She was one of 49 athletes with special needs selected to represent Great Britain at the 2014 Special Olympics European Summer Games in Antwerp last month.

She competed at the 4 Nations Para-badminton Series events around the UK, as well as at the 2013 Special Olympics GB National Summer Games in Bath, where she won silver and bronze.
