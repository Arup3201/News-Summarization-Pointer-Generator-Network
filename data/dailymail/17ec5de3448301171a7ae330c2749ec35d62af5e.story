A thrill-seeking skier has filmed himself performing a front flip off the side of a mountain.

Michel Kuster strapped a camera to his helmet to film the jump before leaping off the cliff in Endelberg, Switzerland.

The 12-second clip shows the 36-year-old landing safely after somersaulting in mid-air.

The stunt was also caught on camera from below by photographer Roger Gruetter.

The daring jump was performed twice - as the pair wanted to make sure they had captured the perfect shot.

Mr Gruetta, also 36, said: ‘Michel Kuster is the skier in the photograph, and we are regularly together in the snow.

‘This cliff in particular we have wanted to photograph for the past year - but we never caught the right conditions.

‘The day before we shot this series it had been snowing heavily and there was enough snow for a soft landing.

‘Michel jumped the cliff twice and I photographed it from two different perspectives. Once laterally with snowy mountains and the other from right underneath him.

‘Michel landed both jumps perfectly and I had both photos in the bag.

‘We always work together as a team - he needs good pictures for his sponsors, I need good pictures to pay my bills. And we have a lot of fun together.’
