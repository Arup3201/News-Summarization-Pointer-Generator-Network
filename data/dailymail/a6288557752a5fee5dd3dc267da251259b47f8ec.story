For most of the past 20 years, a live animal has been used in a small North Carolina town's annual New Year's Eve Possum Drop.

But this year, following challenges from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the organizer says he'll no longer use a live opossum - instead, it'll be a road-kill opossum or perhaps a pot of opossum stew.

The Brasstown event involves enclosing an opossum in a tinsel-covered plastic box and lowering it to the ground at midnight, then releasing the animal.

Annual event: As many as 3,000 people watch the Possum Drop each year

As many as 3,000 people watch the Possum Drop each year, The Los Angeles Times reported.

PETA says the lights, noise and crowd can harm an opossum's nerves and health.

'Even if the animals are released alive, they may die later of "capture myopathy," a cascading series of catastrophic physical reactions to stress or trauma,' the group said in a statement to the newspaper.

A judge ruled earlier this month that organizer Clay Logan could use a live opossum if he got a state permit. But Logan says he didn't have time to do so.  

'We’ll still do something – maybe some roadkill or a pot of stewed possum,' Logan told The Los Angeles Times.

'Rain, storm, sleet or dark of night will not stop the Possum Drop,' he also said.

He says if he doesn't use a road-kill opossum or stew, it'll be something similar. Logan says he used a dead possum once previously because of legal challenges.

A judge's 2012 ruling said a Possum Drop permit could not be given out by the Wildlife Resources Commission, WRAL reported.

Dispute: PETA says the lights, noise and crowd at the Possum Drop, can harm an opossum's nerves and health

Organizer: A judge ruled earlier this month that  Clay Logan, seen here at last year's Possum Drop, could use a live opossum if he got a state permit. Logan says he didn't have time to do do 

However, legislation was later passed which said Logan could get a permit if he carried out wildlife captivity criteria, according to the affiliate station.

WRAL reported that PETA wanted to quash Logan's 2014 license and also accused him of violating his 2013 license.

A May 2014 bill from Rep. Roger West (R-Clay) went through earlier this year and kept Clay County free from possum wildlife laws between December 26 and January 2 annually, the media outlet reported.

However, PETA was granted a restraining order earlier this month blocking the move by Super Court Judge Bryan Collins, according to WRAL. 

Logan wrote in a December 20th letter to Senior Administrative Judge Fred Morrison Jr. that a live possum would not be part of this year's events, the news outlet said.

WRAL reported that 'After receiving Logan's letter, Morrison on Monday dismissed PETA's challenge to Logan's license renewal as moot.'

Jeffrey Kerr, general counsel lawyer for PETA, said in a statement 'There’s nothing festive about tormenting a timid opossum. Brasstown can throw a grand party without engaging in cruelty to animals.'

'Even if the animals are released alive, they may die later of "capture myopathy," a cascading series of catastrophic physical reactions to stress or trauma,' PETA said in a statement
