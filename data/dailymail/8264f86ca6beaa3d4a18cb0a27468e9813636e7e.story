Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said today he is 'open' to reviewing the U.S. military's policy on transgender service in the military.

Hagel called the issue 'complicated because it has a medical component to it,' while indicating that the department tasked with overseeing the nation's armed forces is willing to reconsider its ban.

'I do think it continually should be reviewed,' Hagel said. 'I'm open to that, by the way. I’m open to those assessments.'

U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel says he is 'open' to reviewing the military's policy on transgender service - something that the armed services do not currently allow

Transgender troops have quietly been calling on the military to remove its ban since the government repealed its Don't Ask Don't Tell Policy that disallowed gay and lesbian individuals from serving in the military.

After Hagel spoke at a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride 
(LGBT) pride event at the Pentagon last summer, those in favor of 
lifting the ban hoped it was a sign of progress on the issue. But nothing changed in the months after.

The 
Department of Defense's current policy is to allow transgender people to
 serve in civilian positions, but not in the armed services. The military cites medical reasons as the cause for disbarment.

A March report commissioned by former U.S. Surgeon General to Bill Clinton Jocelyn Elders on behalf of San Francisco State University's Palm Center posits that 'there is no medical reason for the ban.

Elders says the ban 'expensive, damaging and unfair 
barrier to health care access for the approximately 15,450 transgender 
personnel who serve currently in the active, Guard and reserve 
components.'

The report estimates that if the military allowed individuals wishing to undergo sex changes to stay in the service, it would affect approximately 230 members of the service and 'would place almost no burden on the military.' Each sex change operation would cost the government $30,000, it says.

Former 
Navy SEAL Team 6 Chris Beck, who now goes by Kristin Beck, has proposed a
 pilot program that would give service members in the process of 
changing their sex a year to complete the emotional and physical transition in return for two years of additional service.

The report had no visible effect on military policy when it was published.

''At this time there are no plans to change the department's policy and 
regulations which do not allow transgender individuals to serve in the 
U.S. military,' Defense Department spokesman Navy Lt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen said.

Hagel's remarks to ABC News on Sunday may signal that the military has shifted positions on the issue.

'Every 
qualified American who wants to serve our country should have an 
opportunity, if they fit the qualifications and can do it,' Hagel told ABC's Martha Raddatz.

'This is an 
area that we’ve not defined enough.'

If the U.S. changed its policy, it would join a host of other countries that allow transgender individuals to serve, including Great Britain, Canada, Israel, Spain and Sweden.
