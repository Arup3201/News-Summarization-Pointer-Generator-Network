When a fan wrote a letter to Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning back in September requesting her husband meet him, it was Manning who had to run several yards to meet her family, singling out her letter from the thousands.

Kristen Patterson wrote Manning a letter on September 21 requesting that he meet her soldier husband, Army Sgt. Ryan Patterson, a super fan who would stream games at all hours of the night while stationed in Afghanistan for two years.

Indy Star reports that Army Sgt. Ryan Patterson of the 1/25 Stryker Brigade Combat Team grew up watching Peyton Manning and even tried to get stationed in Colorado so he could watch Broncos games.

Meeting: Kristen Patterson, her daughter Olivia, and her husband Ryan Patterson were thrilled to meet Peyton Manning (right) after he tracked them down all the way in Alaska after receiving fan mail from them 

Happy family: Ryan Patterson, Kristen Patterson, and Olivia Patterson got to meet their favorite football player Peyton Manning last month after he tracked them down thousands of miles away in Alaska 

‘My name is Kristen Patterson. I am writing to ask a question. You see my husband is a HUGE fan, and when I say HUGE I mean it. He is currently serving our country in the United States Army and has deployed twice to Afghanistan. He would set alarms to wake up at odd hours in the night just to listen to your football games. We recently had to move across the country for the Army and he tried to get us stationed in Colorado just so he could ensure that he would never miss your games,’ reads the touching letter sent months ago.

Ryan Patterson was stationed all the way in North Pole, Alaska roughly 3,950 miles from where they were stationed first stationed in in Fort Campbell, Kentucky and a far stretch away from Denver where the Bronco's play.

Along with Ryan Patterson moved his wife Kristen and their 10-month-old daughter Olivia.

Kristen Patterson's letter stood out to Manning but Kristen neglected to leave her contact information and it took Manning three months to find her after enlisting the help from the Broncos' public relations team.

Manning's public relations group was eventually able to contact a utility number in Alaska who called State Troopers who called Kristen Patterson to give her the good news.

Actually, to ensure the meeting would be a surprise, the state trooper called Ryan Patterson's phone and asked for his wife.

Kristen told her husband she received a phone call about a pole K9 demonstration at the school where she worked.

'When I got a call from (an Alaska) State Trooper they asked if I wrote a letter to Peyton Manning,' Patterson said.

'They said the Denver Broncos were trying to get a hold of me. When I sent it, you never know if someone is going to read it or if it is going to be tossed in a pile. So I thought they never read it, no big deal.'

Patterson arranged with Manning team to meet him in Cincinnati on December 21 at a hotel where the team was staying.

Best wife ever: Ryan Patterson told reporters his wife Kristen was the best wife ever after she arranged for him to meet his favorite football player Peyton Manning 

She tried to keep the meeting a surprise for her husband but when they arrived at the hotel where the Broncos were staying her husband caught wind of what was going on.

The Patterson's say that Manning was a kind and welcoming gentleman.

'The team's flight was delayed, so I was pacing the room like I was expecting a child. I saw (Manning) come up the escalator and my first reaction was he is at least 15 feet tall, if not taller,' said Ryan Patterson, who felt blessed to meet Manning and also get an autographed football.

'Peyton introduced himself, asked my daughter's name and played with her for a second and thanked me for my service.'

Ryan Patterson said Manning was pleased to meet him and that he is extremely grateful for his thoughtful wife.

'He seemed genuinely tickled that we lived in North Pole, Alaska. He said, '"You guys are really hard to find'" Patterson said. 

'Before he left he shook my hand and thanked me for my service one more time and I thanked him for being my quarterback,' he added.

'Kristen) enjoyed the fact that she is the greatest wife ever and there was nothing I could ever do to top this. "If you asked me who is the one person, anybody in the world, I want to meet, I would immediately say Peyton Manning and she made that happen,' he concluded.
