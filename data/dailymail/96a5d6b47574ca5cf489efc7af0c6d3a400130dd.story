A former council caretaker with a grudge against an elderly resident has been convicted of daubing a swastika and 'Jews Out' on her property.

Stephen Loosemore, 50, scrawled the message in large letters after a four-year feud with frail Vera Morgan, 84, a court heard.

He was caretaker of the block of flats in Redcliffe, Bristol, when he fell out with Mrs Morgan and her house-bound husband James, 85, who live four doors away from him.

Loosemore - who said he knew the couple were not Jewish, or German - admitted carrying out the act because he wanted to scare them after they 'upset' him.

He daubed the Nazi Party emblem on her windows alongside the word 'witch' and scrawled 'Jews Out' on her front door.

Loosemore admitted causing racially-aggravated damage at Bristol Magistrates Court and was handed a six-month community order.

Ian Dawes, prosecuting, said: 'It's apparent the parties do not get on.

'The defendant was seen by a different neighbour painting on the front door of the complainant's address the word 'Jews'.

'A different witness then saw the same defendant walking away with a tin of paint.'

The feud is believed to have started when Mrs Morgan complained about another resident at the block of flats and Loosemore got involved.

He was investigated by the council in 2010 when Mrs Morgan accused him of pushing her over when she confronted him about her plant pots being damaged.

In 2012 he was convicted of damaging a pot outside her home.

Jennifer Stetson, defending, told the court: 'The complainant, it seems, made complaints about another resident.

'Mr Loosemore came to the resident's assistance and matters escalated.'

Loosemore claims he was provoked by Mrs Morgan and says she made a comment about his dog, saying, 'you're the next one of be run over' after his previous pet suffered the same fate.

Miss Stetson added: 'He doesn't think she's German and he doesn't think she's Jewish. He admits that at that point he did want to upset her, as he had been upset.'

The court heard Loosemore - who is no longer caretaker of the block - suffers from depression and has an issue with alcohol.

Bristol City Council said they would now review his tenancy in light of a second conviction for criminal damage against him.
