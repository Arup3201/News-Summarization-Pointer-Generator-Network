An 86-year-old hotel that once hosted travelers coming through Houston, Texas, was demolished in a matter of seconds on Sunday.

The historic 10-story Ben Milam Hotel building was imploded to make room for an upscale 380-unit apartment complex, according to the developers in charge of the project.

Observers snapped photos and shot video as the structure collapsed into a big cloud of dust.

The hotelâ€™s demolition comes at a time when the city wants to make its downtown area more residential, KTRK in Houston reported.

The developers, The Finger Companies, said they considered preserving the hotel, but the structural elements would not have worked for the modern residential units they are planning to build.

The Ben Milam was once used to serve train travelers who arrived from Union Station across the street.

It was constructed around 1926, right before the Great Depression hit, by Houston attorneys John Crooker and R. Clarence Fulbright.

The building's architect was James Ruskin Bailey, who also designed Houston's Public National Bank Building.

Cooling off visitors: In 1932 the Ben Milam became the first hotel in Houston to be fully air conditioned

Crooker and Fulbright named their hotel after the Kentucky-born soldier Benjamin Milan, who fought during the Texas Revolution and was killed in action in 1835.

In 1932 the Ben Milan became the first hotel in Houston to be fully air conditioned.

The hotel closed for business in the 1970s.

The Houston-based D.H .Griffin demolition crew reportedly used 350 pounds of explosives to take down the 10-story building at 12.30pm on Sunday afternoon.

Dust: The residual cloud of dust lasted longer than the building's collapse

Time to go: Observers left the scene before the dust blew their way

Imploding a structure like the Ben Milam can cost as much as $200,000, Larry Grisham, senior vice president of the demolition firm JTB Services, told the Houston Chronicle.

Preparing the demolition and clearing the property can more than double that price, he said.

The last structure in Houston to be imploded by dynamite was the Montagu Hotel, which was demolished in 2008.

Part of a 46-story skyscraper now sits in its place.
