Forgetful: Fewer than half of the people in the survey could recall when Princess Diana died, even though it was only in 1997

The internet could be making us more forgetful, according to a study published yesterday, because it is so easy to 'Google it'

The survey of 2,000 adults found fewer than half could name the year that Princess Diana died, even though it only happened in 1997.

Less than one third knew the year in which the Berlin Wall fell and just 50 per cent were aware of when man first walked on the moon.

Remarkably, four in ten didn’t know the year in which the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center took place.

As many as 87 per cent of those who took part said a ‘heavy reliance’ on the internet meant they made less of an effort to remember things 'because we can look them up'.

The research, commissioned by Grant’s Whisky, examined the modern Brit’s knowledge of famous historical events and the years in which they took place.

The study launches Grant’s ‘Read All About It’ campaign which will offer purchasers of every special bottle, a free newspaper front page reprint from any date in history since 1903.

Unsurprisingly, the most common date known was the Battle of Hastings in 1066, while the dates of the two World Wars and England’s World Cup win were also ingrained on the nation’s memory.

A spokesman for Grant’s Whisky said: 'Certain dates are impressed upon us a lot at school and tend to stick but clearly the art for remembering dates fades and it seems we are now retaining less.

History: Nine in 10 people could remember the Battke of Hastings was, 1066

'Particularly in terms of recent events, for example people were four times more likely to know when The Battle of Hastings occurred than they were to know when the invasion of Iraq took place.

'The internet is an incredible resource which enriches and adds much to the quality of modern life, but it could be changing the traditional way we remember and process things - certainly compared to older generations.

Terrorist attacks: Only six in ten could remember in what year 9/11 took place, 2001

'Perhaps the ability to know the exact dates of things isn’t so crucial, but it’s important the human stories behind those events don’t get lost and we never stop appreciating what’s happened before.'

It also emerged a concerned eight in ten people feel younger people today are less bothered with history, while the same number feels today’s youth are raised to be more self-involved and less appreciative of what’s gone before.

In fact, 56 per cent thought that with 24/7 news and continuous updates on what’s happening, there is less focus on past events nowadays.

Despite this, an overwhelming 88 per cent felt that learning and teaching history was still relevant even in an age where knowledge is just a mouse click away.

The Grant’s Whisky spokesman added: 'Key moments in history have made us who we are and offer great learnings.

'There is nothing more powerful than hearing about a key historical event from the horse’s mouth but we are clearly not doing enough of it.

'The retelling of stories is not only a powerful way to educate the younger generation, but also a wonderful way of bringing generations together to spend quality time and nurturing a wonderful bond between them.'
