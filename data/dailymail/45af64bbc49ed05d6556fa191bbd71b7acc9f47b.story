Tottenham sporting director Franco Baldini will be in position at the World Cup to ensure the club are in prime position to strike in the transfer market.

The well-connected Italian will be in Brazil to ensure he can lead Spurs' attempts to land their World Cup targets during the tournament.

New manager Mauricio Pochettino has put a new central defender and left back at the top of his summer shopping list.

Recruitment drive: Spurs want to give new manager Mauricio Pochettini some funds to add to the squad

And Spurs spies - including chief talent-spotter Ian Broomfield - will be in South America running the rule over the tournaments top talent.

The club already have a list of pre-identified targets, which include Swansea left back Ben Davies and Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi, who plays for Standard Liege.

But Pochettino will be keen to stamp his own mark on the club's recruitment policy this summer; starting in Brazil later this month.

Baldini led a mass transfer drive last year which saw the club spend in-excess of £100million on fresh talent - though that was mostly funded by Gareth Bale's £85million move to Real Madrid.

Tottenham's spending will not be as excessive this summer, though Pochettino will still be given a healthy budget to strengthen his squad ahead of his first season in charge.
