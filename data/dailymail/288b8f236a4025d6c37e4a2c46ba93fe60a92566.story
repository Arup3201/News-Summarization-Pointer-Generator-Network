An Ohio pet owner has been arrested and fined just $25 after police rescued a starving, flea-invested dog that had been chained to a tree for four years.

Jeremy Shane Temple was taken into custody from his Middletown home after officers and Butler County Dog Wardens responded to a report that pets were being mistreated at the residence.

Officials discovered a the German Shepherd which was severely emaciated tied to a tree in the backyard with only little food and water.

Just skin and bones: Joseph, the dog, was chained to a tree for four years

Skinny: After what he's been through, it's amazing this pitiful German Shepard is even alive

Heart-rending sight: Toby the German shepherd, later renamed Joseph, was found chained to a tree in his owner's backyard without food or water

Temple reportedly told suspicious neighbors that Joseph had a disease that made him appear to be emaciated.

When confronted by police about the pet's horrific living conditions, Mr Temple allegedly responded, 'the dog is not a human.'

The suspect told investigators that he had the German shepherd for four years and usually kept him outdoors.

Temple
attempted to explain away Toby's skeletal appearance by saying that 
during the summer months, the pooch normally shed a lot of weight.

The malnourished pup covered in sores and tick bites was released into the care of the non-profit PAWS Adoption Center,
 where staffers renamed him Joseph in honor of the biblical character 
who was left for dead by his brothers, only to became a leader. 

Fined just $25: Middletown police have charged the dogs owner Jeremy Shane Temple with animal torture, chaining and having an unlicensed dog

Clinic manager: I've seen some really bad dogs he's by far the worst. His hair's falling out because of malnutrition, most of his teeth are gone. His aren't gone from chewing bricks and rocks his were knocked out

'Joseph' should weigh about one hundred and twenty pounds.

When
Middletown police and volunteers from PAWS brought him to the 
Westchester Veterinary Center last Friday, he barely weighed half of 
that. He is so starved and sick he's literally nothing but skin and 
bones.

Clinic manager Mike Gigis says "I've seen some really bad 
dogs he's by far the worst.  His hair's falling out because of 
malnutrition, most of his teeth are gone. 

His
aren't gone from chewing bricks and rocks his were knocked out and the 
ones that are there are bad. This sweet Shepherd's never been 
vaccinated.  He has heartworms and a raging ear infection.

Goodbye Toby, Hello Joseph: Animal rescue volunteers and vets gave the dog a biblical name, Joseph, because it's a miracle he's still alive

Found just in time: Sick and starving he was rescued on Friday by police and animal advocates and now they're trying to save his life

Skin and bones: When Joseph was rescued by police, he weighed only 60lbs, was covered in tick bites and had some of his teeth knocked out  

Investigators say he was chained to a tree for years behind this Middletown home.

Called in to help, volunteer Meg Melampy took his chains off Friday.  
She says, 'My first thought was how sad he looked.

He just looks up like
with that head hanging low and that sad face and he's tethered to a 
chain to that tree and there's nothing around it, no food no water no 
straw, blanket, nothing for this dog.'

Intolerable cruelty: When an animal rescue volunteer gave Joey a bath, she recalled blood flowing from flea-ravaged skin

Brutal: In the last three months there have been four brutal cases of animal abuse coming out of Middletown, Ohio but this is the worst

Medical:This sweet Shepherd's never been vaccinated. He has heartworms and a raging ear infection. Investigators say he was chained to a tree for years behind this Middletown home

Meg Melampy, a PAWS volunteer, recalled to the local station WCPO that when she gave the pooch a bath, blood from incalculable flea bites freely ran off his body.

'When I gave him a bath, the blood just ran off of him,' Melampy said.

Clinic manager Mike Gigis described it as the worst case of animal abuse he has ever seen.

According to Gigis, Joseph came in weighing only about 60lbs, with his fur falling out from malnourishment and most of his teeth knocked out, the station WKRC reported.

Gigis said he was shocked when the dog was brought to his clinic.

'There's no excuse for this. None,' Gigis said. 'I mean, you can see, this is the worst'

So far, the animal rescue center has spent $1,200 covering the pup's medical costs, which are expected to surpass $2,500.  

Legal woes: Temple is facing animal cruelty charges for keeping his pet chained to this tree for four years

Road to recovery: Vets and volunteers will try to save the dog and eventually find him a home

Pricey: At this point, the medical bills for "Joseph" have added up to around $1,200 dollars. Just the heartworm treatment alone could go as high as $2,500

Following Temple's arrest, a member of his family even got one of the local residents to write a letter confirming that he had never seen the animal suffering abuse. 

Beside the $25 fine, Hamilton Journal News reported that Temple also faces charges of cruelty to companion animal, unlicensed dog and improper chaining or tethering. He is due back in court next week.

'He’s feeling a little better now, a little more perky,' West Chester veterinary clinic manager Michael Gigis said.

Joseph is said to be doing better these days and is expected to make a full recovery. The plan is ultimately to put him up for adoption.
