Most us have been left wondering, at some point, where the letters and packages that never reached the mailboix actually ended up.

And for hundreds of unlucky people in western Kentucky, the answer was the basement of a vacant home that belonged to their mailman's dead mother.

William 'Brent' MorseÂ  has been convicted for destroying, hiding and delaying the delivery of U.S. mail, after some 44,900 pieces were found stashed in the basement and a rented storage unit.

Federal sentencing guidelines called for the Dawson Springs man to get a two-year prison sentence, however the judge gave him six months in jail followed by six months home detention.

Worst mailman ever?  Former United States Postal Service Employee William Morse, 34, from Dawson Springs, Kentucky was sentenced on April 17 to six months in prison followed by six months of home incarceration for destroying, hiding and delaying the delivery of at least 44,900 pieces of mail

The massive stash of mail was split between a storage unit (pictured) and the home of Morse's dead mother

Police caught Morse after the owner of the storage facility saw the door to his unit was ajar. When the man saw the Postal Service crates he called the police

The basement of the home that once belong to Morse's late mother was literally full on undelivered mail

The U.S. Postal Service say that all of the mail that was recovered has since been delivered to its rightful recipients

'He wanted to speed up his route,' said Capt. Craig Patterson, the police officer who arrested Morse last year, according to USA Today.

'I think he was lazy.'

Morse had been a letter carrier for five years.

He has also been ordered to pay $14,808 in restitution that will be split between residents, a bank and two other businesses who were affected by his laziness.

Morse's crime was uncovered when the owner of the storage facility found the door to his unit ajar.

When the man saw U.S. Postal Service crates inside he called police.

While other postal employees have been caught in the past dumping their deliveries, Morse's case seems to be significantly bigger.

The New York Post reported in March that a Long Island letter carrier had been charged with throwing about 1,000 pieces of mail into trash bins.

In Australia, The Age in Victoria reported last year that a carrier for Australia Post was charged after about 10,000 undelivered pieces of mail were found in his bedroom.

Morse also was convicted of theft in state court for cashing about $31,000 in Social Security checks made out to his deceased mother

Morse's lawyer, federal public defender Patrick Bouldin, said that his client was going through a divorce, was responsible for picking up his children during the day, and would 'store' his mail if he hadn't finished delivering it.

'It's not that he was stealing anything from it,' said Bouldin.

Morse was responsible for the delivery of 1.2 million pieces of mail during his tenure.

Incredibly, the court heard how only a few of the 250 recipients on his route were financially affected.

It was this number that helped with his reduced sentence.

Morse also was convicted of theft in state court for cashing about $31,000 in Social Security checks made out to his deceased mother, Patterson said, and placed in diversion for five years, according to the Hopkins County commonwealth's attorney's office.

U.S. Attorney David Hale said Morse dumped mail for two years, ending in March 2013, and destroyed at least 1,000 more pieces.

All the mail that was recovered from Morse has delivered to its rightful recipients.
