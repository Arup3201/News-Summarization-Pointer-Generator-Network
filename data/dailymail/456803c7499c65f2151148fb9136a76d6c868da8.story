Martin O’Neill says his opinion cannot be swayed by Premier League managers who do not rate his players.

The Republic of Ireland boss was making specific reference to winger Aiden McGeady, who has not played a single minute for Everton under Roberto Martinez since the end of January.

The 28-year-old is set to figure for the Irish in their crunch Euro qualifier with Group D leaders Poland in Dublin on Sunday night.

But O’Neill, whose fourth-placed side trail their opponents by three points, said: ‘If I was to make a judgement on every single player at club level I might be listening to the wrong comments. 

‘Roberto Martinez is absolutely entitled to pick whoever he wants. If he doesn’ t think Aiden is playing well enough to merit a place in his team, that’s entirely up to him. 

‘We’ve a different aspect here. We sometimes maybe don’t have that particular choice in hand for players in that position.

‘But Aiden is very important to us and a change of environment might just give him a lift.’ McGeady has scored more goals for his country this season – two – than he has for the Toffees – one.

His match-winning double in Georgia in September has helped Ireland stay in contention for one of the two automatic qualifying berths for France 2016.

O’Neill added: ‘It’s a disappointment from this side that Aiden’s not playing. It would be great, absolutely fantastic, if players were coming in here on the back of having played the last couple of weekends, but you always sense it’s never going to be that way.

‘What you wouldn’t want is to be going into a game with maybe three or four not having played that much football.

‘But I think adrenaline can carry you a certain distance. Listen, this is a big game, a really big game. It’s taken a long while for it to come around and it’s nearly upon us now so they should feed off all of this and be really positive.’

O’Neill, meanwhile, has told his players to forget about their Premier League relegation worries.

Nine of his squad currently reside in the bottom half of the top-flight, including the likes of Sunderland skipper John O’Shea.

‘I want the players to go into the game with real, serious confidence,’ said O’ Neill.

‘Put club football aside. Forget its trials and tribulations, get that shirt on and give it everything.

‘We’re playing at home and the crowd will be on our side, at least for a while, so go for it.’
