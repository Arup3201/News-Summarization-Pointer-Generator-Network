Donald Sterling has been caught in a new race storm after it emerged he is being sued by a woman claiming to be his former lover.

The former Los Angeles Clippers owner allegedly  unleashed 'a stream of racist and sexist taunts' directed at divorcee Maiko Maya King and, referring to her children, asked her why she would 'bring black people into the world'.

But the mother-of-two, who worked as the 80-year-old's PA and caretaker, claims when she objected, Sterling fired her.

In her new lawsuit, the 40-year-old says she was in a relationship with Sterling between 2005 and 2011, TMZ reported today.

King
 claims during their affair, which overlapped with Sterling seeing V. Stiviano, he made comments about her 
former African-American husband.

He allegedly asked her: 'How could you be married to
 a black man?'

King says she had children with her ex and Sterling asked: 'Why would you bring black people into the world?'

King alleged Sterling told her: 'I want to take you out of the black world and put you into the white world.'

She also claims Sterling said: 'Black people do not take care of their children.Â  All they do is sit at home and smoke dope.'

And she claims he said: 'Mexicans just do drive-by shootings.'

King claims in her filing that during her employment, Sterling said he was bored sexually with his other assistant, V. Stiviano.

He offered King bonuses if she could help him sexually, she wrote in her lawsuit, according to TMZ.

Sterling insisted she tell him stories about past sexual conquests in order to arouse him, her lawsuit reportedly states.

Stiviano recorded the racist rant that was leaked and led to Sterling's ejection from professional basketball.

Maiko King's lawyer is famed civil rights attorney Gloria Allred, TMZ reported. On her website she displays her poetry and art says she runs a groupd called The Circle of Charities.

Sterling was recorded making racist remarks that resulted in an NBA ban in April and a fight over ownership of the Clippers.

He then handed control of team to his wife Shelly before a $2 billion deal to sell the franchise was agreed with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.

It came just days before a NBA panel was due to
 meet to discuss revoking Sterling's ownership over the team in light of
 the racism scandal last month.

However the deal has yet to go through as it has to be approved by the NBA and Sterling is believed to be fighting it.

Sterling had bought the Clippers for $12.5 million in 1981.
