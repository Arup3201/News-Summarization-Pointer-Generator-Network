Serena Williams took the metaphor head over heels literally after she celebrated her WTA Finals title triumph on Sunday.

The 33-year-old beat Simona Halep 6-3, 6-0 in Singapore to collect her third-successive season-ending championships victory.

After collecting the trophy for the fifth time in her career, Williams uploaded images via her Instagram account posing alongside the silverware as she performed handstands in the locker room.

Williams' success over Halep allowed her to avenge an embarrassing group-stage loss to the Romanian player just four days prior during the group stage of the tournament.

The American won 11 of the last 12 games in the match in what was the most one-sided championship clash in the WTA Finals since Kim Clijsters beat Amelie Mauresmo 6-2, 6-0 in 2003.

In winning the tournament Williams has joined tennis greats Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf as the only players to have won the event five times.
