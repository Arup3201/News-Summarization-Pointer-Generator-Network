In Nigel Clough’s first week as Sheffield United manager, he offered to help a wayward forward with extra shooting practice after training only to be told by the player he had an important appointment with his tattooist.

Suffice to say, that player is now pursuing a career away from Bramall Lane. When it comes to laying down the football law, it’s a case of ‘like father, like son’ in the Clough family.

To say Nigel is a replica of his legendary dad Brian, who won the league championship with Derby County and Nottingham Forest and two European Cups with Forest, is simplifying things slightly.

Certainly, Brian would never have been accused of being disrespectful to match officials as Nigel was by Southampton manager Ronald Koeman after a stormy Capital One Cup tie on Tuesday night, when League One United won 1-0 to record their 13th victory in 16 cup ties under Clough.

The clash with Tottenham in January will be their second major semi-final in two seasons.

Yet there are overpowering similarities, and not just because Nigel seems to be physically morphing into his old man, so much so that brother Simon — who works as a scout for the Blades — has noticed he is subconsciously replicating some of their father’s mannerisms.

P.S. Clough-managed sides have been knocked out of cup competitions twice by Man Utd — the 2005-06 FA Cup and the 2008-09 League Cup — but managed to avoid defeat in the home match of both ties. 

Nigel is not only strong on discipline and team ethic, he has also inherited the knack of maximising his players’ abilities. 

Against Southampton, Clough gave a debut to Che Adams, who was playing non-League football with Ilkeston a few weeks ago, selected right winger Ryan Flynn at right back and started with 17-year-old Louis Reed in midfield.

Brian bought striker Gary Birtles from Long Eaton for £2,000 and turned him into a European Cup winner, saved the career of Kenny Burns by shifting him from centre forward to centre half and picked 18-year-old Gary Mills for a European Cup final against Hamburg.

Like Dad, Nigel believes in wingers and keeping instructions simple. One pep talk to a No 11 lasted four words: ‘Run at your man’.

Club owners Kevin McCabe and Saudi Prince Abdullah bin Mosaad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud will also be relieved to see some good publicity come the club’s way after the mess they made of offering convicted rapist Ched Evans a chance to train with them.

Blades midfielder Jose Baxter says Clough has raised expectations in a way you can imagine Brian doing at Derby and Forest.

‘He wants everyone bang at it. He won’t let your standards drop. He wants you to play until the last whistle is blown,’ Baxter explains.

Unlike Brian, 48-year-old Nigel is happier to give credit to his players and the fans for the fantastic run. Their knockout prowess makes their position of only fifth in League One all the more strange.

Bramall Lane was a bearpit on Tuesday and made any club who don’t take the cups seriously look ridiculous. ‘It was a remarkable effort by the players and the supporters,’ said Clough. ‘We went for it. We try to do that in most games but haven’t quite had the breaks.

‘The 14 lads we put out there gave everything. Nights like that are very special because of the atmosphere.’

Of course, there had to be controversy, too, with a Clough involved. Koeman refused to shake hands due to what he considered a lack of respect from the Blades bench — including coach Chris Morgan, who was sent to the stands — towards fourth official Paul Tierney.

Even Brian Clough would have been hard-pressed to beat Nigel’s one-liner about the snub. ‘To say I’m not too concerned is an understatement — I couldn’t care less,’ he said.

Like father, like son.
