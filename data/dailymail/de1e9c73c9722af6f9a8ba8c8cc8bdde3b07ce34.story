A transatlantic flight which made an emergency landing in Scotland after a passenger found a note which read 'I'll set this plane on fire' was back in the air today.

Following a search of the aircraft by police officers overnight, it was allowed to continue its journey this morning to America.

'Officers have carried out an extensive search of the aircraft resulting in no suspicious items being found,' said a spokesman for the Scottish Police.

'Tense': Passengers were met by police officers at Prestwick Airport after the unscheduled landing

Fears: The flight was escorted by fighter jets from RAF Leuchars

Alert: Strathclyde Police confirmed that a 'suspicious note' had been found on board the plane

On board: BBC New York producer Nada Tawfik found the note in the cabin toilets scribbled on a napkin

The EgyptAir passenger jet, carrying 326 people, was escorted by Typhoon fighter jets
 from RAF Leuchars and met by a convoy of half a dozen police vehicles at Glasgow Prestwick airport.

It had been travelling from Cairo to 
JFK Airport in New York when it was diverted after the seemingly 
threatening note was found in a toilet.

Passenger Nada Tawfik, a producer for
 BBC New York, was on the flight and said she found the note in the 
Boeing 777's toilets by the sink.

She immediately told cabin crew who locked the toilet.

Egyptian-born Ms Tawfik was flying back to New York after a month visiting her parents in Cairo.

Speaking from inside the plane, she told the Mail on Sunday that she went to use one of the toilets about three hours into the flight.

She then saw the message on the napkin, which read: ‘I’ll set this plane on fire. Seat 46D.’

Ms Tawfik said: 'I freaked out straight away and thought about my daughter. I went to the back of the plane and showed the note to members of staff.

'They locked the bathroom and said they would take care of it. But nothing happened for a while and I was freaking out, thinking we were in danger. I even walked by 46D but there was just an old woman sitting there. I didn’t think it was a joke. Who jokes like that on a plane these days?'

After landing at 2.30pm yesterday, passengers became angry and frustrated as they waited with very little information about what was going on. Ms Tawfik said: ‘It is very chaotic in here.’

Stranded: The EgyptAir flight remains in a secluded part of the airport with 326 passengers on board

Earlier she told the BBC News channel how she had immediately informed cabin crew after finding the note.

She
 said: 'It was on a hand napkin written in pencil and the pencil was 
actually still there so I told the crew to make sure to keep it so they 
can get any finger prints off of it. They locked the bathroom 
immediately so that no one could go into it.'

'It almost looked like a child's 
handwriting or someone who has very sloppy handwriting, but it was very 
alarming especially these days when everyone is so concerned about 
safety on flights. I said to one of the stewardesses 'I don't know if 
this is a prank', they said no, it can't be a prank.

'Either someone has a very bad sense of humour or, you know, it's very scary.

'Ongoing': Strathclyde police made all on board disembark and be interviewed yesterday before they continued their journey this morning

Concern: This passenger plane travelling from Egypt to New York was diverted to Glasgow Prestwick airport and met by armed police officers

Alert: Around half a dozen armed police units were rushed to the airport to meet the plane

After surrounding the plane in a secluded part of the airport, police eventually allowed passengers to disembark the aircraft.

It took six hours before all 326 people on board were removed from the plane to be interviewed by police.

Detective Superintendent Alan Crawford, of Police Scotland, said: 'The flight had 326 people on board, and as it approached UK and Scottish airspace there was a suspicious note found, the captain and crew took action to divert to Prestwick.

'The vast majority of passengers have now been safely removed from the plane and I fully anticipate they will all be removed very soon along with the crew.

'There may well be different nationalities involved and that could be a challenge for us but we have officers and interpretors to speak to everyone.

'The airport is still open and there is no threat to anyone else in the airport.'

Mr Crawford continued: 'The passengers will be taken to a safe place and speak to officers.

'There was no one removed in handcuffs and no one has been detained or arrested and we're continuing our investigation into the note that was found and its origin and motive.

'The terrorist threat has not been increased as a result of this incident today. Police and emergency services continually train for this type of incident and today is a demonstration of all the agencies involved and passengers are being removed safely.

Discovery: BBC producer Nada Tawfik said she found the note in the plane's toilets

'This note, whatever narrative it contained, we have to treat it seriously and maintain the safety of passengers and crew.

'Whether it is a prank or not this 
will be investigated thoroughly to establish the circumstances. We could
 never write something off as a prank without investigating.

'The captain took the decision to 
divert the aircraft and it's now for police to investigate where that 
note came from and to see if we can identify who put it within the plane
 and what was the circumstances leading to that.'

Prestwick is a airport which is designated to deal with emergency incidents.

Police said the order in which people
 were coming off the plane was co-ordinated to help keep families 
together, and to aid looking after elderly or infirm passengers.

There were 326 people on the plane, including 307 passengers.

Scotland's Justice Secretary Kenny 
MacAskill said: 'I am pleased that all passengers are safe and well. 
Scottish Government officials have been working with Police Scotland and
 other agencies, and I am being kept informed of developments.

'Police Scotland have been following protocols that are in place to deal with an incident such as this.'

The dramatic landing comes just weeks after a similar incident in which a Pakistani International Airlines flight was escorted to Stansted airport by RAF Tycoon jets following a dispute on board.

Two men were later charged with endangering an aircraft.
