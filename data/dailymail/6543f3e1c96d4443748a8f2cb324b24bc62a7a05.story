It looks like a typical American wooden starter home.

And with just two bedrooms and a single bathroom spread over its modest 960 sq/ft living space, there's hardly enough living space for even the smallest family.

Yet this unprepossessing 70-year-old bungalow at 353 Carmelita Drive in Mountain View, California, is on the market for a wallet-busting $1.1million (£700,000).

The reason? It's less than ten minutes' drive from the headquarters of online search and advertising giant Google.

Modestly extravagant: The unprepossessing 
bungalow at 353 Carmelita Drive in Mountain View, California, which is 
on the market for a massive $1.1million because it's so close to search 
giant Google's headquarters

Who lives in a house like this? Well, no-one at 
the moment. But the tiny two-bedroom bungalow is likely to be snapped up
by a Google software engineer - or by a canny landlord hoping to rent 
it to one of them

Just an average middle-class American suburb... The area's property prices have risen in line with tech stocks

Property website Zillow boasts that the 'charming cottage' has just been completely renovated. But the million dollar asking price is not going on the bamboo floors and remodelled kitchen.

What potential buyers will be paying for is the privilege of living in Mountain View, where property values have soared as Silicon Valley stock prices have exploded.

And although reliable figures are hard to find, Google is reputed to lead the pack in doling out the big bucks to its software engineers and designers, with even interns earning a massive $6,000 a month.

The £300billion dollar company's Googleplex headquarters also offers a range of on-site perks to employees, so that they need not even spend a penny of their healthy salaries on outside entertainments.

So it's no suprise that the internet giant allegedly receives a resume every 25 seconds from job-seekers eager to join the Silicon Valley gravy train.

Recently renovated: The front door of the bungalow opens into this living room with just-laid bamboo floors

Open plan living: A view of the living room from the opposite angle shows how it extends into the kitchen

All mod cons: The kitchen boasts granite worktops, plenty of cupboards and stylish brushed metal appliances

For those plaid short-sleeve shirts: Although on a Google salary you could probably afford a service wash

This is where the magic happens... Although it probably takes place via webcam

Deceptively spacious: The property's bathroom makes clever use of the limited space available

The washroom: Because just one bathroom is never enough these days, the developers have added a half one

However, that puts the ordinary, non-IT working residents of towns like Mountain View in a difficult position.

'There are more new money millionaires ride-sharing across California than ever before,' explains Valleywag's Sam Biddle.

'They pay cash. They move fast. They might dig the modesty of [a] quiet residential plot. They might want Zuckerberg-chic, not ostentation.

'This isn't a problem if you're a well-to-do software engineer, but for the rest of humanity, you're suddenly priced out.'

And the situation is only likely to get more difficult. Zillow predicts that Mountain View house prices are likely to rise a further 7 per cent next year.
