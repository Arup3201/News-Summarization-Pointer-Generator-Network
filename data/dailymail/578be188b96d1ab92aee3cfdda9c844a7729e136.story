Gareth Bale returns to Real Madrid's formidable strike force to face Rayo Vallecano on Saturday and Carlo Ancelotti wants the Welshman to increase his defensive work.

Despite registering five goals and more shots than Isco, the Real manager has asked Bale to emulate the defensive work ethic that the Spaniard has shown in Bale's absence. 

'Lightning returns,' read Marca's headline ahead of Bale's return to Madrid's forward line alongside Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, known collectively as BBC.

The 'Lightning Returns' says Marca as Gareth Bale looks set to return to Real Madrid's starting line up 

The 25-year-old came on as a substitute in Madrid's Champions League clash with Liverpool on Tuesday but missed the El Clasico with Barcelona on Saturday after suffering with a gluteal muscle injury.

Fellow Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo, focused on Lionel Messi scoring his 71st Champions League goal, equalling the record set by Raul, despite being just 27 years old. The Argentinian has been in competition with Ballon D'Or winner Ronaldo, who remains one behind the record with 70 goals. 

In Italy, Corriere dello Sport looked at Inter Milan and Napoli's performances in the Europa League. Former Swansea midfielder Jonathan de Guzmán scored a hatrick to give Rafael Benitez's side a   3-0 win against Young Boys, while Inter were held to a 1-1 draw with St. Ettiene on Thursday. 

Tuttosport reported the reaction of former Juventus star Pavel Nedved to their 1-1 draw with St. Etienne, saying that Massimiliano Allegri's side need to improve in Europe.
