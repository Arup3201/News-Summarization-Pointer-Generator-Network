Victim: Shaun Williams was beaten up by the male friends of a woman he was on a date with

A man who went on a date with a woman he had recently met ended up being beaten up, robbed and stripped naked.

Shaun Williams was found by police on Friday at the side of the road in Bunnell, Florida, naked, disoriented and covered in blood.

He explained that he had just been on a first date with a woman named 'Tree', but instead of going out for dinner she had him beaten up and abandoned him in a field.

Williams, 34, said that he met Tree at a convenience store in Daytona Beach two weeks before the incident, and had shared phone numbers with her, according to FlagerLive.com.

The pair kept in touch, and arranged to go on their first date on Friday evening.

Tree picked up Williams from outside the store where they had first met, and had two men sitting the back seat of her car at the time.

She claimed that one of them was her brother and the other a friend of his, and said she would drop them off before taking Williams to dinner.

However, after driving out of town for a few minutes, she pulled onto a remote side road and her brother said: 'Stop right over here. I've got to wait for a friend.'

When Tree backed into an empty cow pasture, Williams left the car and went to urinate.

It was then, he claimed, that he was knocked to the ground after being struck twice in the face by a piece of metal.

One of the men said, 'Give me all your money and all your clothes,' to which he replied, 'Are you serious?'

The man said, 'Do you see what Iâ€™ve got pointed at you?', and when Williams opened his eyes he saw that the man was pointing a semi-automatic pistol at him.

Williams stripped naked and handed over his clothes along with a cellphone and $200 in cash.

The officer who found him later that evening took him to the hospital where he was treated for lacerations to the face.

Tree and her two alleged accomplices are wanted for questioning by police.
