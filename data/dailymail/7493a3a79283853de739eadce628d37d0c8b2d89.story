A neolithic bow and arrows that could have been used to hunt reindeer thousands of years ago, have been discovered in a patch of melting snow, archaeologists said.

The ancient artefacts, the oldest of which is approximately 5,400-years-old, were found in the mountains of Norway.

The scientists who came across them, believe the discovery demonstrates the worrying effects of climate change, as precious finds are being exposed.

A neolithic bow and arrows that could have been used to hunt reindeer have been discovered in a patch of melting snow. The oldest of the arrows (pictured) is 5,400-years-old. The bow and arrow design is strikingly similar to those found in other frigid locales, such as the Yukon, the archaeologists said

The bow (pictured) made of elm, was about 3,800 years old, the archaeologists said

Martin Callanan, an archaeologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, told LiveScience: 'It's actually a little bit unnerving that they're so old and that they're coming out right now. It tells us there's something changing.'

Dr Callanan and his team have spent recent summers hiking the Trollheim and Dovre mountains to study the rate of snow melt and trawl the area, south of Trondheim, for artefacts left behind by ancient hunters.

They said the mountains tower some 6,200 feet above sea level and at their peaks, only rocks and snow are seen.

Over the summers of 2010 and 2011 the team stumbled across a patch of melting snow that gave up an ancient bow and several arrows that had been buried in the hard snow-ice for centuries.

Upon closer inspection they found the bow was made from elm wood, which grows at lower altitudes in the mountain range and near the coast, while the arrow tips were made from slate.

However, they said in a study, published in the journal Antiquity, that after dating the finds they now believe the bow is 3,800-years-old, while the oldest arrow dates back an incredible 5,400-years.

Dr Callanan and his team think the hunting tools were used by Stone Age men to kill reindeer, which keep cool in the summer by staying on the higher parts of the mountain range.

The scientists suggest that the animals' cool retreat gave them a break from annoying insects and the heat, but their predictable patterns probably made them a relatively easy target for hunters.

While there is no evidence of who the arrows and bows belonged to, but they are similar in design to some found thousands of miles away in similarly chilly environments.

Dr Callanan said: 'The people in Norway, they didn't have any contact with people in the Yukon, but they have the same type of adaptation.'

However, he said that different cultures living in similar environments acted in the same way.

While the find is no doubt a valuable insight into how stone age man lived thousands of years ago, another archaeologist who was not involved in the study, E. James Dixon, director of the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology at the University of New Mexico, said that if climate chnage is causing the ancient snow to melt, it is bad for archaeology,

Artifacts can be preserved for thousands of years in the ice, but when it melts they can quickly decompose, he warned.

'For every artifact we find, there are probably hundreds, maybe thousands, that are lost and just destroyed forever,' Dr Dixon said.

Other scientists believe global warming is leading to an increasing number of archaeological discoveries in cold and icy regions.

Melting
snow has recently revealed a remarkably intact woolly jumper likely 
worn by a fashion-conscious reindeer hunter some 1,700 years ago.

The
find, which sheds more light on the life of people living in the Iron 
Age, was found two years ago in Norway, but has recently been examined 
by scientists.

Marianne 
Vedeler, from the University of Oslo and Lise Bender Jørgensen, from the
Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, told 
Discovery News: 'Due to global warming, rapid melting of snow patches 
and glaciers is taking place in the mountains of Norway as in other 
parts of the world, and hundreds of archaeological finds emerge from the
ice each year.'

The tunic was crafted from wool woven in diamond twill, which was apparently fashionable at the time and was made between 230 and 390 AD.

It was worn by someone living in the hunting area of the Norwegian Lendbreen glacier, at around 6,560 feet above sea level, where it was found.
