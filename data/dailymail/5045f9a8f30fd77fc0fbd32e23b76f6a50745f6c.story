CLICK HERE to read our exclusive interview with Harry Redknapp as he opens a treasure trove of wonderful football memories in a new book that celebrates icons of the game.

Harry Redknapp has opened a treasure trove of football memories in his new book, 'A Man Walks On To A Pitch,' serialised by Sportsmail this week, and reminisces with Head of Sport Lee Clayton about a life following the game. Here are 10 of the best bits from the interview, which you can read in full here.

Harry Redknapp reflects on a lifetime of watching football in his new book, 'A Man Walks Onto a Pitch...', which is being serialised by Sportsmail, and picks his favourite XI from every decade he has enjoyed the game

On the days before wall-to-wall live football on the box... 

‘We only saw one game a year on TV – The FA Cup Final. And our telly was a nine-inch black and white. We hung a magnifying glass from the top that made it a twelve inch when you looked through it’.

On the tricky task of comparing eras...  

‘How can you ask me to choose between the years with Duncan Edwards, Tom Finney and John Charles and the years with Jennings, Souness, Dalglish and Keegan? Or Ronaldo, Bale, Gerrard, Scholes against Vieira and Keane’.

On his favourites... 

‘Dave Mackay was one of the best I’ve ever seen, Jimmy Greaves was the greatest goal scorer and George Best was just the best. The greatest. He knew players went out onto the pitch to hurt him. They couldn't get near him.’

Tom Finney, seen here playing for Preston North End, was a favourite of the young Harry

Redknapp ranks George Best as the greatest - 'Players couldn't get near him,' he says

On Duncan Edwards...

‘Duncan Edwards… England debut at 18, won 7-2 against Scotland. Died at 21. Tragic. He was buccaneering, like Roy Keane plus Steven Gerrard and maybe a bit more. Defender, midfield, goalscorer, powerhouse, leader, winner. Everything. Such a shame.’

On the modern way of negotiating a new contract... 

‘These days the player tells the agent, the agent speaks to the chairman, the player might even speak to the chairman himself. Their attitude towards the manager is “You are only passing through, so why should we bother with you?”’

On what the legendary managers of the past would think of players today...

‘I do wonder how managers like Brian Clough and Bill Shankly would cope. How would Cloughie deal with players taking five pairs of different colour boots to a game? We used to squeeze into a mini bus with two skips. Now you take a small army to an away game.’

Duncan Edwards was one of the best players of his generation but perished in the Munich crash aged just 21

Brian Clough would not have stood for the antics of today's footballers, says Redknapp

On money in the game today... 

‘Yes the game has changed. There is more money, more of everything and manager’s salaries have improved, but I’m not sure how many of the current lot could hold a light to Clough, Shankly, Don Revie, Ron Greenwood. Jose Mourinho? Probably, yeah. Pellegrini won the title, but he won the title because he has got good players and spends good money. How much coaching does Vincent Kompany need?’

On intolerance... 

‘Imagine Bert Trautmann playing now. A German, who fought for the Nazis, in goal in this league. People would spit on him, abuse him, terrorise him. There is so much hatred now.’

On retirement... 

‘What else would I do (apart from manage)? I play a bit of golf. I’m useless around the house. I don’t have any hobbies. I just love the game. You get older quicker without it and, when you win, there is nothing like it.’

On the matchday experience for the fans...

‘The old man would wear a suit and tie (and go to football). There was no aggro, no abuse, no segregation, no bad chants. I couldn’t let my Grandchildren go to Southampton the other week because of the abuse I have to put up with.’
