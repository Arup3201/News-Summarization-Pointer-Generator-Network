London Mayor Boris Johnson, arriving at the CBI conference today, warned against a tax raid on homeowners

Downing Street yesterday ruled out 
creating new council tax bands on £1million homes as Boris Johnson 
denounced the idea as ‘absurd’.

George Osborne and Nick Clegg have held talks about imposing new taxes on houses worth more than £1million.

But No 10 yesterday made clear that 
David Cameron will not countenance new council tax bands on high value 
properties or the Liberal Democrat demand for a new tax on mansions.

Instead, the Prime Minister’s official
spokesman indicated that the Chancellor could introduce a stamp duty 
increase for expensive properties in his Autumn Statement next month.

Making clear that new wealth taxes 
will be introduced, she said: ‘As a point of principle we’ve made it 
clear that those with the broadest shoulders should bear the greatest 
burden.

‘We don’t think that people who’ve worked hard and saved up to buy a home should be hit with a mansion tax.

‘And we’ve no plans to introduce new council tax bands either – we’ve ruled out a re-evaluation in this parliament.’

But asked if Number 10 was ruling out a rise in stamp duty, she said: ‘This is all a matter for the Autumn Statement.’

The push by ministers to introduce new taxes on the wealthiest puts them at odds with the London mayor.

Mr Johnson told the CBI conference in 
London: ‘High rates of personal taxation are likely to make us less 
competitive.

'We should have taxes that are low but fair and it is absurd
to be suddenly whacking up taxes on cash-poor people who happen to 
inhabit expensive houses in London.’

He urged politicians to be positive 
about businesses and stop talking about austerity and spending cuts as 
this puts ‘a big downer on growth and enterprise’.

The Mayor also encouraged foreign 
billionaires to sue each other in London and their wives to launch 
divorce proceedings here too, even though ministers have repeatedly 
called for an end to ‘libel tourism’.

He said London lawyers ‘will be grateful for your business’.

He also encouraged couples to come to Britain to divorce, to boost London's legal services.

'I
would never encourage anyone to sue, but if one oligarch feels defamed 
by another oligarch, it is London's lawyers who apply the necessary balm
to the ego,' he said.

'I
have no shame in saying to the injured spouses of the world's 
billionaires if you want to take him to the cleaners... take him to the 
cleaners in London. Because London cleaners will be grateful for your 
business.'

Senior figures have
told the Mail an increase in the rate of stamp duty on properties 
selling for seven figures or a rise in capital gains tax are much more 
likely.

The Treasury and the
Lib Dems admit that new wealth taxes for the best off are coming to 
justify another £10billion of cuts in welfare that are necessary to keep
deficit-reduction plans on track.

Mr
Osborne’s aides yesterday played down reports that he has already 
agreed with Mr Clegg to push for new council tax bands, pointing out 
that he has publicly described them as unworkable.

But
two other sources revealed that the Chancellor has told the Lib Dems he
is not opposed to new bands in principle. An ally admitted he regards 
the plans as ‘impractical’ rather than ‘unacceptable’.

And
government officials confirmed that some sort of new property tax – be 
it stamp duty or council tax – is ‘on the table’ as part of discussions 
by the Cabinet Quad of the most senior ministers ahead of the autumn 
statement.

Mr Cable said: 
‘There needs to be a sense of fairness, and these best-off people in 
society have got to contribute more. There are arguments around 
taxation, about property taxation.

‘It’ll all be resolved in the next 
few weeks. But certainly, the principle is right that the top of 
society, the best-off, have got to pay more. This is all under 
discussion.’

He added that property taxes were ‘the obvious place to go’ to tax wealth.

‘It isn’t simply that it’s fairer – it’s 
that property can’t run off to Monaco and Liechtenstein; if you’re 
trying to deal with abuse of the tax system, this is the best way of 
doing it.’

'There needs to be a sense of fairness, and these best-off people in society have got to contribute more. There are arguments around taxation, about property taxation'

Treasury sources are at pains to claim that the Chancellor is just as keen as the Lib Dems to tax the wealthiest, not just as a quid pro quo for more welfare cuts.

‘We have always said the people with the broadest shoulders should bear the greatest burden,’ one said. ‘We’re committed to that. It’s not just some deal.’

The highest rate of council tax is currently Band H, levied on properties worth £320,000 or more in 1991, but that means the super-rich in multi-million-pound mansions pay no more than many whose properties have simply grown in value to around £1million now.

But sources close to Mr Cameron have indicated he does not support any change to council tax. ‘The Prime Minister is no great fan of property taxes and his view hasn’t changed,’ one said.
