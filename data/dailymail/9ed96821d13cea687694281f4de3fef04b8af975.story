A series of car bombs in mainly Shi'ite areas of Baghdad killed 69 people and wounded at least 140 on Saturday, police and medical sources said.

The attacks come during a surge in violence in Iraq since the start of the year. The wave of separate explosions targeted markets and busy shopping streets.

The bombings, which appeared coordinated, were similar to attacks in Baghdad on Tuesday in which 50 were killed.

Bombing: The bloodshed comes after Iraqi security forces promised to step up efforts to increase security to protect the public during Ramadan. This year's Ramadan was the most violent since 2007, with 671 people killed

Responsibility: No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, though security forces and civilians are frequently targeted by al-Qaida's Iraq branch

The bloodshed also comes after Iraqi security forces promised to step up efforts to increase security to protect the public during the Eid al-Fitr celebrations that mark the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. This year's Ramadan was the most violent since 2007, with 671 people killed.

'My shop's windows were smashed and smoke filled the whole area,' said shoe shop owner Saif Mousa, who survived an attack near his store in New Baghdad.

'I went outside of the shop and I could hardly see because of the smoke... At the end, we had a terrible day that was supposed to be nice because of Eid.'

Many of the attacks occurred within an hour of each other, suggesting a level of coordination in the assaults. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, though security forces and civilians are frequently targeted by al-Qaida's Iraq branch.Â 

Sunni Islamist militants have been regaining momentum in their insurgency against the Shi'ite-led government and have been emboldened by the civil war in neighboring Syria, which has stoked sectarian tensions across the Middle East.

Police said the deadliest of Saturday's attacks took place when a suicide bomber drove his explosive-laden car into a residential area in the town of Tuz Khormato, killing eight people and wounding dozens, Mayor Shalal Abdool said. The town is about 200 kilometers (130 miles) north of the Iraqi capital.

Strategic shift: Iraqi officials have attributed the recent uptick in the death toll figures to a change in tactics by insurgents who are now trying to attack crowded, soft civilian targets such as cafes, mosques and markets
