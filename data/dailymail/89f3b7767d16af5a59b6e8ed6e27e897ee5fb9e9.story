FIFA has fined the Argentine Football Association 30,000 Swiss francs (Â£19,540) as punishment for the displaying of a provocative banner relating to the Falkland Islands.

The world governing body opened disciplinary proceedings against the AFA last month after national team players held up a banner stating 'Las Malvinas son Argentinas', which translates as 'the Falkland Islands are Argentinian', before kick-off in a friendly against Slovenia in La Plata on June 7.

Not the first: Boca Juniors also posed with the banner ahead of a match against River Plate on March 30 2014

The message was displayed in support of an on-going campaign to claim sovereignty of the islands, a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic Ocean.

A statement from FIFA said the AFA had been fined and issued with a reprimand after it was deemed to be in breach of Article 60 of the FIFA stadium safety and security regulations ('political action') and Article 52 of the FIFA disciplinary code ('team misconduct').

The AFA was notified of the terms of FIFA's decision on Friday.
