The man accused of killing Usher's 11-year-old stepson Kile Glover while operating a jet ski on a Georgia lake in July 2012, has been sentenced to four years in prison.

Jeffrey Hubbard, a close friend of Kile's father Ryan Glover, had been found guilty of all five charges - homicide by vessel, serious injury by vessel, reckless operation, unlawful operation of personal watercraft and boat traffic violation - by a Hall County jury last month.

Kile never regain consciousness following the incident on Lake Lanier, northeast of Atlanta. A second victim, Jordan Shepp, then 15, was also seriously hurt.

Defense lawyers had claimed that Hubbard tried to avoid the children and that what happened was a tragic accident, reports WSB-TV.

Kile's mom Tameka Raymond was married to Usher
 (real name: Usher Terry Raymond IV), 35, for two years.

They divorced in 
2009 and had been in the throes of a bitter custody
 battle over their sons - Usher Raymond V, six, and Naviyd, five - when Kile was tragically killed.

Hubbard was arrested March 1, 2013, after being indicted by a grand jury.

'At the end of the day, I know he didn’t do it on purpose,' Foster told WSB-TV. 'He could’ve only loved Kile.'

In court this week, Kile’s 
stepmother, Marsha Glover, cried as she told the court that Hubbard had 
been driving his jet ski in a reckless manner prior to the collision.

‘He was just zooming back and forth, yelling with no hands standing on the jet ski. Just really crazy and erratic,’ she said.

State investigators said they did not believe Hubbard was intoxicated at the time of the incident.

Glover said she and her husband Ryan 
saw Hubbard racing toward their pontoon boat, which was towing their son
 and Shepp on an inner tube.

‘We
 looked up and I saw Jeff coming as if he was coming directly toward the
 boat. And before I knew it, there was a big cloud of water,’ Glover 
said.

She told the jury that seconds later, she and her husband realized the jet ski had struck the two children on the tube.

‘I
 screamed. My husband immediately jumped in the water. I was on the 
phone with 911, our kids are in the water and we need help,’ Glover 
said.

Kile, who was wearing a life preserver, was unresponsive when he was pulled from the lake. Both children were airlifted to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston.

Kile was 
declared brain dead on July 8 and on July 21 he died after being removed from life support.

Just over a year later, on August 5, 
2013, Usher's eldest son, Usher V, was hospitalized in the ICU after he 
became stuck in a drain while swimming in a pool at Usher's home.

The
 next day, Foster filed a request for an emergency custody hearing in 
Fulton County Superior Court, seeking temporary primary custody and 
citing Usher V's ‘near-death accident’ as evidence of a lack of 
supervision of the children.

At the hearing on August 9, 2013, the case was dismissed and Usher retained primary custody of their two sons.

The courtroom showdown between the former couple took a surprising turn, when Usher offered his ex-wife a consoling hug.

Almost a year after Kile's death, Tameka lost her custody battle with the R&B singer
