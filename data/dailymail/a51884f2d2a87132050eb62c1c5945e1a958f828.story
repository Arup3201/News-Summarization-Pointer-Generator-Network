A company has launched a fitness band for children as young as four which measures how much exercise they do.

Its makers claim it is a useful tool to encourage youngsters to play and develop healthy habits as parents track their activity.

But it has had a less than positive reception from parents, who said that children should get out in the real world and play rather than ‘burying their heads in technology’.

TheLeapBand, which resembles a watch, has a small screen with a virtual pet which is given rewards, including healthy snacks, if children complete a certain amount of exercise.

The band, which goes on sale today costs £29.99 and is designed for children aged four to seven.

Its makers claim that the device, which offers 50 different activities and challenges, monitors a child’s physical movements and awards them points for being active.

These points can then be translated into games and rewards, including ‘healthy snacks’, for a choice of eight virtual pets, which they can personalise.

The pet idea is similar to the Tamagotchi, a digital pet which can be named, fed and watered by its owners, and became a hit in Britain after originating in Japan.

On the website, the band’s makers, LeapFrog, write: ‘Discover the only activity tracker just for kids that encourages active play and healthy habits with a customisable pet pal.’

Parents can download games for the band, which is being promoted by athletes Greg Rutherford and Beth Tweddle.

But the idea was criticised by parents who argued that children should be outside playing rather than using technology to take exercise.

Richard Jones wrote: ‘Just as they are about to look up to the beautiful world around them we encourage them to bury their heads onto some joyless app in the name of technology. Not for my kids.’

Mestizo wrote: ‘I’d say you’ve pretty much failed as a parent at the point you’re thinking your 4 year old needs a pedometer. And kids will get bored of it in minutes, as is the case with all worthy toys.’

Bluetwo wrote: ‘Just the thing for stupid fat lazy parents who won’t play with their kids. You want to get the children [out of] the lounge? Take an interest in their lives. That may mean getting fat lazy parents out of the house as well - will they need a toy watch for that?’

But ExpatMum wrote on the Guardian website: ‘That might not be a bad idea! My youngest has no interest whatsoever in sports and doesn’t do anything beyond PE lessons at school, (although we take the dog for long walks).

‘He’s too old for this but it’s given me the idea of getting him something like it to perhaps jog his interest in moving about more!’

Child obesity campaigners added that children should never be rewarded with food for completing exercises.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, which campaigns on childhood obesity, although welcoming the idea, said food should never be a reward for exercise.

‘The idea is positive, as long as the reward for exercise is not food and parents are sensible. We need to keep our children active and we all know that they are notoriously difficult to get off the sofa,’ he said.

‘Parent’s aren’t aware of how much activity their children do and if this helps parents, then great. Ultimately, they’ll decide whether this works.

‘The really tragic thing is that the activities are being rewarded by food. Often, these supposedly healthy snacks are full of sugar.

‘Children should never be rewarded with food however healthy they say the snacks are.’

The makers of the LeapBand also released research which suggests that parents aren’t sure of the best way to keep their children healthy due to confusing messages about health.

The survey also suggested that despite a summer of sports competitions, like the Commonwealth Games and World Cup, 10 per cent of children would rather watch sport on television than play it.

Of the 1,000 parents questioned, 38 per cent with children aged four to seven were confused about the best way to keep their child fit and healthy due to confusing and mixed health messages.

Almost a fifth of parents did not know that the Government recommended daily amount of physical activity for children five years and older is 60 minutes per day, it also found.

The average parent spends less than two hours a week playing physically active games and sports with their child, with a quarter admitting they just do not have time to make active plans for their children, it showed.

And despite a summer of sport on television, a third of children have shown no interest in sporting events this year.
