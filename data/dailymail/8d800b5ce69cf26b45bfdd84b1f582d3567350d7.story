Manchester City are monitoring Isco’s situation at Real Madrid after the European champions completed the signing of James Rodriguez from Monaco.

The move could leave Isco surplus to requirements at the Bernabeu just a year after he chose Madrid over City.

Manuel Pellegrini, his former Malaga boss, remains keen on the 22-year-old midfielder although a deal this summer could be difficult with City restricted by a UEFA-imposed transfer cap and foreign quota limitations.

Meanwhile, the Premier League 
champions are unlikely to sign a replacement for Alvaro Negredo after 
learning that the Spain striker may only be out for two months with a 
broken bone in his right foot.

Negredo
 suffered the injury in a friendly against Hearts last week and will 
miss the club’s pre-season tour of the United States.

City kick off their first game against Sporting Kansas City in the early hours of Thursday morning.
