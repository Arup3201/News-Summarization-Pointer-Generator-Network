A senior Eurocrat attacked Britain yesterday for having a ‘too generous’ welfare system and insisted there will be no tightening of the rules on EU immigration.

Theresa May travelled to Brussels to demand changes to the free movement directive that has allowed more than a million Eastern Europeans to move to the UK since 2004.

In a combative intervention, the Home Secretary suggested the idea of a ‘cap’ on the number of EU workers that Britain should be expected to take.

But her pleas were immediately rejected by EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding – who also vowed to block Britain’s attempts to end ‘benefit tourism’.

In a stinging response, Mrs Reding said that only Britain was to blame for any abuse of its welfare system by migrants.

She hit back: ‘It seems that some national systems are too generous. Don’t blame the Commission or EU rules for national choices and national regulatory systems.

‘If member states want to restrict the availability of social benefits to EU citizens they can do two things. First, change their national systems to make them less generous.

‘Second, apply the existing EU rules which provide safeguards to counter abuse, fraud and error: for example possible expulsion orders and re-entry bans in case of abuses.’

Mrs Reding ruled out any change to the EU free movement rules – despite the pressure on UK ministers to make changes ahead of the lifting of controls on Romanians and Bulgarians next month. ‘Our EU rules are good and they are here to stay. Member states need to apply them to tackle abuse.’

Upon her arrival at a meeting of EU justice ministers in Brussels yesterday, Mrs May called for reform of free movement, a proposal with support in Germany, the Netherlands and Austria.

Ministers were last night accused of running scared from a gathering Tory rebellion over the lifting of controls on Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants.

Some 63 MPs have signed an amendment to the Government’s Immigration Bill demanding that existing controls on workers from the two countries should not be lifted on January 1.

However, in a move which provoked anger on the Tory backbenches, Leader of the House Andrew Lansley yesterday ‘delayed’ debate on the legislation until the New Year.

By that time the migrants will already be allowed to work in the UK and the rebel Tory amendment could no longer apply.

Tory MP Mark Reckless said: ‘It would surely make sense for the House to vote on whether to extend immigration restrictions for Bulgaria and Romania in advance of them being lifted?’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage accused the Government of ‘desperately trying to bury the news’ by delaying the vote on the same day that Westminster was focused on the Autumn Statement.

Mr Lansley insisted the overall progress of the Bill – which would make it easier to deport foreign criminals – would not be delayed. ‘It is simply that I have announced in the future business before Christmas, progress on five Bills.’

She said: ‘For future accession treaties, we must be able to slow full access to each other’s labour markets until we can be sure it will not lead to mass migration.

‘This could, for example, be achieved by requiring new member states to reach a certain level of income or economic output per head before full free movement is allowed.

Second, looking ahead, we must seize the opportunity presented by the Prime Minister’s plan to reform the EU and address the problems caused by free movement.

For example, why shouldn’t national governments be allowed to impose a cap on numbers if European immigration reaches certain thresholds?’

Earlier this week, Mariana Campeanu, Romania’s labour minister, said Britain should be grateful to Romanians and Bulgarians for taking jobs shunned by locals.

Ministers insist they are powerless to maintain existing restrictions on citizens from the two countries on January 1.

Instead, Mrs May is now focusing on changing the rules in the long-term.

David Cameron is expected to raise the idea of a cap on EU migrants in future negotiations over the UK’s membership of the EU.

n Romania and Bulgaria have by far the highest poverty levels in Europe, said a report yesterday.

Half of Bulgarians and 41.7 per cent of Romanians qualify as poor, compared to a European average of about 25 per cent.

The EU’s statistics arm Eurostat said more than four out of ten children in the two countries are also poor. Some 44 per cent of Bulgarians and 30 per cent of Romanians are ‘severely materially deprived’. The UK figu re is 7.8 per cent.
