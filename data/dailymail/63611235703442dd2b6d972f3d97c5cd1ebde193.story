The ex-professional footballers who planted a pompous flag in the moral high ground this weekend made me laugh.

Some of them claim they never dived or went over easy in their careers but you can guarantee when they were playing they all appealed for a free-kick or a penalty they knew for certain wasn't theirs.

There are levels of cheating, or trying to con the ref, and some may well be seen as worse than others.

But the reaction to Ross Barkley's dive has been totally over the top, and some well-respected football pundits need to have a broader view of the modern game - and not just throw in cliches because they know it pleases the public.

Barkley went down without being touched, got straight up, didn't appeal for anything, and carried on playing.

The referee Mark Clattenburg blew his whistle for a foul on the Everton player. So what exactly did Barkley do wrong?

Those football observers in this country who have an unhealthy obsession with eradicating diving from the game will focus more on young talented English players, and they don't deserve it.

It's all very worthy, but all so very unrealistic as well. For a start, Barkley does not have a reputation for cheating. So why pick on him after one incident?

Secondly, some top players with a reputation for diving – Cristiano Ronaldo, Arjen Robben, Luis Suarez and even in the past, George Best – are footballers who like to have the ball at their feet and run with it. Defenders kicked them more than they kicked the ball. 

Why wait to be hacked down? If you're a skilful player who can skip a tackle, why stay on your feet and wait for your ankle to get smashed if you can avoid the potential injury and go down for a free-kick?

Barkley is a player who runs with the ball – a rare breed from this country and we should be protecting him. He's not a baby, he will have to put up with knocks, kicks and bumps. But there's a limit.

Of course Kevin Nolan didn't even make a challenge on Saturday in that incident, but Barkley has every right to protect himself.

Everton fans will remember a foul from Nolan that caused an injury to Victor Anichebe, then a Toffee, which robbed the Nigeria international of his chance of playing in the 2009 FA Cup final. In fact it was such a bad foul Anichebe sued for loss of earnings. The case was settled out of court, Anichebe receiving a six-figure sum.

Roberto Martinez is spot-on when he said after the game that Barkley had every right to 'expect contact.'

Diving isn't something that should be taught or encouraged but it is very much a part of the global game of football and it's about time England faced that reality and got cuter in their approach. I don't want to win a fair-play trophy, I want to win a real one.

If Barkley is kicked all over the pitch in the final game of the season, and then decides he's had enough so he dives for a penalty to secure Everton a top-four place in the final minute, the same high-principled ex-players-turned-pundits will be wailing and weeping.

It makes you wonder if they've ever played the game.
