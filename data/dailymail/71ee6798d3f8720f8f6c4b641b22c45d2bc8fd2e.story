A new ‘secret justice’ row flared up last night after it was revealed that two suspected terrorists could be tried behind closed doors.

Prosecutors will apply to a judge today for a draconian order to hold large parts of a major terrorist trial out of the public eye.

Senior Scotland Yard detectives believe that alleged conspirators of the men could be tipped off if details of their actions are made public. They said there are ‘strong operational reasons’ for large swathes of the trial to be held in secret.

But critics said the move is further 
evidence of a dangerous trend of secrecy despite Britain’s historic 
commitment to open justice. Shami Chakrabarti, director of campaign 
group Liberty, condemned the move as part of a ‘dramatic drift towards 
secret trials’.

‘Cases littered with initials instead of names are no way of ensuring trust and confidence in our justice system,’ she said.

‘The
courts should at least provide clear explanations rather than bland 
assertions before closing their doors on press and public.’

Neither
of the men, both aged 25, has been named publicly since they were 
arrested when the tyres of their car were blown out by police in London 
last month.

Both terrorist 
suspects are British citizens, one of Turkish origin and the second from
an Algerian background. One of the men, known only as AB, is charged 
with preparing terrorist acts, which carries a maximum sentence of life 
imprisonment, and possessing a terrorist document. The second man, known
as CD, has been charged with possessing a terrorist document and an 
offence under the Identity Documents Act 2010.

The
document is suspected of being instructions on how to make a bomb and 
prosecutors claim it was found hidden on a memory card in their mobile 
phones.

During a hearing 
last month, prosecutor Michael Atkinson said the defendants could not be
identified to ‘protect an ongoing investigation’. He said that 
associates of one of the defendants may also recognise him if further 
details of the charges he faces are revealed.

Two other men, aged 29 and 28, arrested at the same time were later released without charge.

The
highly-sensitive inquiry comes amid growing concern about the threat of
terrorist plots in Britain linked to jihadi groups fighting in the 
Syrian civil war.

The 
Justice and Security Act has recently provided for secret sessions in 
High Court actions involving national security. Anonymity orders are 
also common in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission which hears 
terror-related cases. But similar levels of secrecy are extremely rare 
in the criminal courts, where almost all proceedings are held in public.

The
preliminary hearing at the Old Bailey will be before Mr Justice 
Sweeney. The application for the secrecy order will be made by the Crown
Prosecution Service Special Crime and Counter-Terrorism Division.

A
CPS spokesman said: ‘We apply for these orders in counter-terrorism 
cases rarely and only when we feel it is necessary to do so.’.

Lord Neuberger said open justice is 'an important function of an open society'

A public grilling of the heads of Britain’s three spy agencies was branded a ‘total pantomime’ yesterday after it was revealed they knew the questions beforehand.

MPs and peers quizzed the men earlier this month amid claims their activities have invaded the privacy of millions.

But sources close to the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) said they agreed to warn MI5’s Andrew Parker, Sir John Sawers of MI6 and Sir Iain Lobban of GCHQ what questions they would face.

The agreement was the only way they would agree to be cross-examined.

But one Tory MP told a Sunday newspaper: ‘Evidently the whole thing was a total pantomime.’

The Cabinet Office confirmed the three were briefed with ‘broad areas of questioning’.ISC chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind said they were given the first question for each category discussed, ‘and supplementaries flowed from members of the committee’.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
