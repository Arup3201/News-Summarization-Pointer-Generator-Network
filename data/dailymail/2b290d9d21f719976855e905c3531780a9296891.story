Cameron Comey, 11, has not been seen for more than two days after falling off the bank of the River Towy

A schoolboy who fell into a freezing river while playing with his younger brother was yesterday feared to have drowned.

Cameron Comey, 11, has not been seen for more than two days after falling off the bank of the River Towy where he had been playing on Tuesday close to home with nine-year-old Anthony.

The younger boy rushed home to their mother, Amanda, 39, in Carmarthen, West Wales, to raise the alarm after watching as his brother was swept into the water.

A massive man hunt involving helicopters, the RNLI and the coastguard was continuing, but rescuers had still not found him last night. 

Family friend Emma Walsh, 26, said: 'It is the worst nightmare for any parent.' 

Dyfed-Powys Police were called to reports Cameron had fallen into the water just before 4pm on Tuesday.  

Police are coordinating the search, working with the Mid & West Wales Fire and Rescue Service, coastguard, lifeboats, mountain rescue and ambulance rescue teams.

Cameron's family are being supported by a specially trained police officer.

Speaking to media at the scene, Inspector Eric Evans said: 'We are conducting a thorough search of the area and following every lead in order to find him. 

'As a police service we deal with missing person reports on a daily basis so are very experienced and well-trained and will be systematic in our approach to finding him.

'Our plan for today is to work more closely with other services who bring specialist skills and equipment in order to search the river.

'Searching a river is difficult with fast flowing water, tidal waters and dark pools.

'We have approximately 50 personnel from all services systematically searching the river from the point of where we believe the 11-year-old has gone in downstream.

'We are being guided by coastguard in relation to the flow of river and tidal water as to how far the boy could have travelled.'
