Steven Banford, 21, from Birmingham (pictured), has been jailed for four months after breaching a two-year Anti-Social Behaviour Injunction (ASBI)

A stone-throwing racist neighbour from hell has been jailed after repeatedly terrorising residents until they were too scared to leave their own homes.

Steven Banford was initially slapped with a two-year Anti-Social Behaviour Injunction (ASBI) after a campaign of abuse and intimidation that included throwing stones at residents as well as verbal and racial abuse.

The 21-year-old, from the Kings Heath area of Birmingham, was first jailed for breaching the ASBI in March, but has now been sentenced to four months in prison for four more breaches of the order.

The thug was served the ASBI at Birmingham County Court 12 months ago after his frightened neighbours anonymously gave evidence about his nuisance behaviour.

Some told the court how they had even refused to leave their homes or use the shops as a result of Banford's relentless abuse.

The order, which runs until December 6 next year, banned him from entering areas of Yardley Wood in Birmingham, and prevented him from causing nuisance or annoyance. He was handed the order alongside 20-year-old Mark Mottram.

Banford denied the latest four breaches of the order but was found guilty based on the evidence of a resident and three police officers.

Councillor James McKay, cabinet member for social cohesion, equalities and community safety at Birmingham City Council, said: 'I hope that this prison sentence delivers a clear message to other individuals that Anti-Social Behaviour Injunctions are a serious matter.

'If they are breached, offenders risk being caught and serving a prison sentence.

'I congratulate the resident and officers involved with this case for their hard work and courage.'

Banford was jailed in March for breaching the order and has now been sent to prison again for four more breaches. The order bans him from entering a specific area (top right) and 'causing nuisance or annoyance'

Inspector Darren Henstock, of West Midlands Police, added: 'This is a great result and shows the hard work between us, local residents and the council in bringing those who are intent on causing misery to their local community to justice.

'It also reminds offenders that prison awaits those who blatantly disregard injunctions placed upon them.

'We continue to work closely with the community and partners to restore confidence and safety.'

One of Banford's neighbours in Allenscroft Road, Kings Heath, said: 'He was simply awful. The fear he caused made everyone's lives miserable.

'Everyone is glad he has been jailed but it only gives us a four-month break. We'd love him to be sent away for years instead of months.'

An Anti-Social Behaviour Injunction (ASBI) is an order that prohibits the person in respect of whom it is granted from engaging in housing-related anti-social conduct.

The order is similar to an Anti-Social Behaviour Order (ASBO) but has been developed to help councils and housing associations tackle anti-social behaviour in social housing areas. 

An injunction can be granted against a person aged 10 or over if two conditions are met:

(i) the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the person has engaged or threatens to engage in anti-social behaviour; and

(ii) the court considers it just and convenient to grant the injunction to prevent the person engaging in anti-social behaviour.

The order can be used in a wider range of circumstances such as anti-social behaviour against hospital staff, shop staff, and  neighbours in the  rented sector.

An injunction is granted for a specific period of time, will name the person responsible for supervising compliance with the injunction and can include a power of arrest if breached. 

The injunction will require the person who is committing anti-social behaviour to comply with rules such as not entering a specific zone, or not causing nuisance to residents. 

They are issued by the County Court and can range from six months to two years in length.

An injunction can be applied for by the police, a local authority, a housing provider, the British Transport Police Force, Transport for London, the Environment Agency or the NHS Business Services Authority.
