Salivating over TV programmes like MasterChef has become a pastime for many of us - me included.

I am not especially blessed in the kitchen - my mum still talks about a strawberry cheesecake that emerged from the oven the same sorry shade of grey as over-washed socks.

But even the most hopeless of cooks can 
experience a little MasterChef magic on their new food-focused holidays 
with a winner or finalist from the show.

Even better, the trips are all 
about eating fine food, not just cooking it.

Heart of the matter: The Djemaa el Fna square bubbles and boils with all sorts of foodie delights

You can do India with Dhruv Baker or Thailand with Andrew Kojima.

I choose Marrakech with Keri Moss, joint winner of MasterChef: The Professionals in 2012.

We roam souks infused with spices before emerging onto the Red City’s chaotic central square, Djemaa el-Fna. Donkeys and scooters dodge snake charmers, and crowds gather around the dozens of outdoor restaurants where grilled meat sizzles and snail soup bubbles.

We journey to saffron farms and Berber villages in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains; tour the city’s famous sights and its backstreet ovens where families take their dough to be baked.

We are never far from a foodie treat: tender tagines; spongy coconut macaroons and streetside mechoui lamb, cooked in an underground pit and served with a sprinkling of salty cumin.

But we prepare the best meal in the kitchens of our plush riad, the Dar les Cigognes.

Under the watchful eyes of Keri and Fouiza - one of the riad’s rotund dadas (cooks traditionally employed by wealthy Moroccan families) - we go to work ‘fluffing’ piping hot couscous.

Later, Fouiza demonstrates how to prepare delicate samosa-like briouats with sweet and savoury fillings like spiced beef and rice with raisins, and a splash of orange blossom oil.

‘Not good,’ she tuts, like MasterChef judge Monica Galetti, at my attempt.

Fouiza was taught to cook at the age of five by her grandmother.

‘My recipes have been passed down generations. They are all up here,’ she says, tapping her head.

A feast is served on the flower-filled rooftop, where storks soar overhead and calls to prayer echo through the air. We eat milky camel meat (tastier than it sounds) and an aubergine, fennel and blood orange salad prepared by Keri.

The briouats are a big hit. As Gregg would say, eating doesn’t get better than this!
