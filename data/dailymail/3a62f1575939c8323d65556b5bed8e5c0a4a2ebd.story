The actress and model, 34, launches her debut range from the brand 'all about fitting and accentuating curves', hitting stores next month.

The Kelly Brook for Simply Be collection also marks the most inclusive range for the brand with sizes going up to a 32.

This £55 cut out detail dress hugs and accentuates curves from a size 10 - a first for Simply Be

A spokesperson for Simply Be, who want to be seen as an all-round fashion label, rather than exclusively plus size, said: 'Simply Be is about offering fantastic fashion for all women, and extending our size range to include size 10 marks the latest step towards being the most inclusive fashion collection available.'

Kelly says: 'It’s been brilliant working with Simply Be on this 
collection. I really wanted it to reflect some of the latest trends 
but also give women the confidence to embrace and show off their assets.

'I’ve
 always found it difficult to find clothes that fit my body shape, so 
this has been a wonderful opportunity to create a range that is all 
about fitting and accentuating curves! I can't wait to see what people
 think of it.'

Prices start at £35 and go up to £130 for a faux fur belted winter coat.

A £75 textured midi dress which nips in at the waist, perfect for parties, is tipped
 to be a best seller.

The £60 full-skirted 
animal print dress is also expected to be an instant hit with Simply 
Be shoppers this autumn. 

This graphic and floral print bodycon dress comes in at £60 and will be available form September 9

Created in 1999 as a catalogue fashion 
business, Simply 
Be has evolved into a well-loved online and retail store brand.

Angela 
Spindler, CEO at N Brown Group PLC, hints at a long term plan to collaborate with Kelly.

'Kelly Brook is the perfect fit for Simply Be as she is shining example of 
somebody who embraces and celebrates her curves,' she says.

'She has put huge 
amounts of energy and passion into designing her collection with our 
team, ensuring each  piece  has the vital ingredients necessary to make 
our customers feel fantastic.

'We’re looking forward the continuing success of the brand with Kelly as part of the team.'

Kelly Brook for Simply Be will be available from September 9 in-stores and online at simplybe.co.uk.
