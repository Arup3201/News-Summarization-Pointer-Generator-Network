Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that Liverpool are in talks with Daniel Sturridge over a new deal worth £150,000-a-week.

The England international, who is currently at the centre of a club versus country row after being ruled out of the upcoming internationals, has been missing for the last month through injury.

It isn’t yet known whether the striker will be fit to face West Brom on Saturday.

Rodgers, however, said the club have had discussions with Sturridge and his representatives with regards to a new contract.

‘Talks are ongoing with his representatives and there is nothing more to add,’ the manager said.

‘He has not trained with the team at all so it was not the right time for him to go [away with England].’
