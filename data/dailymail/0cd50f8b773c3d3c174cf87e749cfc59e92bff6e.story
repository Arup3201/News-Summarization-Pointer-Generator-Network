A 52-year-old former deputy sheriff ran his wife and her male companion off an Alabama road, killing them both, before shooting himself in the head following a domestic dispute early Sunday morning.

Police are investigating the double murder/suicide after officers found the body of the ex-Tuscaloosa County Deputy Sheriff in a ditch off the 15282 Sylvan Loop Road in Fosters about 12.45am. He had shot himself in the head.

The bodies of a 51-year-old woman and 52-year-old man were discovered in a smashed pick-up truck nearby.

killed his wife and her male companion after running them off the road in Alabama on Sunday morning, before killing himself

Tuscaloosa Metro Homicide Unit commander, Sergeant Dale Phillips, claimed the former deputy sheriff had confronted his wife and the man who was with her at 
the other man's residence.

When the pair took off in a white Ford F-150 pick-up truck, the man chased 
them in his vehicle.

AL.com reported the suspect may have fired shots at fleeing pair as he chased them down the road before ramming their truck into off the road and into a ditch.

Phillips said the man got out of his vehicle, walked to the edge of the grassy embankment and shot himself once in the head, perhaps after seeing his wife and friend had died.

The former deputy sheriff left his job at the Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's Office in 1997 seeking work outside law enforcement.
