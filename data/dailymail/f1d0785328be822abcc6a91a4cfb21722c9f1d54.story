Theresa May has pledged to scrap the Human Rights Act if the Conservatives win the next election

Defiant Theresa May yesterday stepped up her campaign to become Tory leader by confirming her plan for the UK to break free of the shackles of European judges.

She also suggested smashing the ‘state monopoly’ of schools and hospitals by letting them make a profit – and demanded a new crackdown on unions.

Labour accused the Home Secretary of revealing a ‘secret Right-wing agenda’ to privatise education and the NHS, and to attack unions.

And they said quitting the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) would backfire.

In a speech at Westminster dubbed her personal ‘leadership May-nifesto’, Mrs May said if the Conservatives were to regain popularity, they had to produce ‘radical’ new policies.

Her comments reinforce claims by her allies who say she is on course to follow in the footsteps of Britain’s first female Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.

Mrs May’s proposal that the UK must consider quitting the ECHR was first revealed by this newspaper last week.

Throughout the week, she refused to comment on the matter, as a feud erupted between her Tory supporters and opponents.

It also fuelled claims that she is secretly preparing a leadership challenge if David Cameron loses the next General Election, due in 2015.

An increasingly confident Mrs May broke her silence at a Tory rally yesterday.

It was time to stop criminals getting off scot-free because of human rights laws, she said, declaring: ‘All options – including leaving the ECHR altogether – should be on the table.’

Adopting the mantle of ‘the new Maggie’, Mrs May said it was time to consider boosting standards in education and health by letting schools and hospitals make a profit.

Aides denied it amounted to privatisation, pointing out schools and hospitals would continue to be ‘free at the point of use’.

Mrs May said the case of hate preacher Abu Qatada, who was denied bail at his latest hearing today, highlighted the need for Britain to change its human rights laws

On quitting the Strasbourg-based 
ECHR, Mrs May said: ‘We need to stop human rights legislation 
interfering with our ability to fight crime and control immigration.

‘That’s why the next Conservative Government will scrap the Human Rights Act.’

To cheers from Tory activists, she 
continued: ‘We should also consider very carefully our relationship with
the ECHR and the Convention it enforces.

‘When Strasbourg constantly moves the
goalposts and prevents the deportation of dangerous men like Abu 
Qatada, we have to ask ourselves, to what end are we signatories to the 
Convention? Are we really limiting human rights abuses in other 
countries? I’m sceptical.’

It undermined Britain’s national interest and its own Supreme Court, the Home Secretary maintained.

‘By 2015 we’ll need a plan for 
dealing with the European Court of Human Rights. And yes, I want to be 
clear that all options – including leaving the Convention altogether – 
should be on the table.’

Similar drastic measures to improve public services should be studied, she said.

The Coalition had already given parents and patients more choice but had not gone far enough, Mrs May insisted.

Tory MP Peter Bone said that Theresa May's speech 'went down very well'

‘I expect our reform agenda to become
even more radical. Yes, the State should make sure that public services
are  available to all and free at the point of use.

‘Yes, the State should regulate those services to make sure they’re provided everywhere and offer high standards.

‘But too often the State is a poor 
provider of services, and its monopoly over the delivery of those 
services must end. A future Conservative Government should increase the 
number of charities, companies and co-operatives that deliver frontline 
services.

‘If allowing them to make a profit 
means we have a more diverse supply side and better outcomes, then we 
should consider it with an open mind.’

Mrs May dismissed claims that people ‘don’t want choice, they just want better services’.

She said: ‘Why should choice be the preserve of the rich, who can afford to go private?

‘Why is it assumed that wealthy parents and patients are capable of making choices, while nobody else is?

‘It will be left to the Conservatives
to break the state monopoly, to open up public services, and give 
everybody – not just the rich – the freedom to choose what is right for 
themselves and their families.’

Mrs May also called for new curbs on 
unions. She said: ‘It’s not just freedom from the State we need to think
about. We need to think about freedom from vested interests. That means
taking on trade unions resistant to change.’

Last night Tory MP Peter Bone said: 
‘There is no vacancy at the moment but clearly in the future, the Home 
Secretary will be a very credible candidate.

‘She has run her department very well
and it’s extraordinarily difficult to be Home Secretary. She has 
handled it very well. She has widespread support in the party.

‘Her views on human rights rules and reports that she wants to pull out of the ECHR went down very well with party members.’

A pensions row has broken out between top judges, including Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, and the Government

The wealthiest judges in the country 
are using human rights laws to challenge the Government over cuts to 
their gold-plated pensions worth hundreds of millions of pounds.

A secret dossier leaked to The Mail on Sunday reveals how Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice and

Britain’s most senior judge, is spearheading an unprecedented attack on the Government’s authority over public finances.

Judges have instructed top barristers to advise them on using human rights laws to sue Ministers who have reduced pensions in line with those paid to senior civil servants.

In the past, judges have not contributed to a pension that pays them half their former salary plus a lump sum pay-off. The changes will result in them contributing for the first time and paying tax on the income the pensions provide.

The 100-page dossier exposes the ferocity of the dispute between the Government and the judiciary which could spark a constitutional crisis.

In one draft of a letter intended for the Lord Chancellor, Chris  Grayling, the judges use the threat of court action to try to get their way. ‘It would be in nobody’s interest for these issues to be resolved by litigation .  .  . however, you will understand that the possibility of recourse to the courts cannot be ruled out.’

Judges earn up to up £240,000 a year. Lord Judge’s annual pension will be £119,922 and he will get a lump sum payment of more than £250,000 when he retires later this year.Lib Dem MP John Hemming questioned how the case could be properly heard in court.

He said: ‘Natural justice requires people do not sit in judgment in their own case. It is difficult to see how an application by the judiciary to quash changes to their own pension payments can be handled without a conflict of interest.’

Neither the senior judiciary nor the Government would comment on the matter.
