Onesies, leopard print, Ugg boots, oversized sunglasses and enormous earrings are the fashion fads and styles men hate on women.

Men voted overwhelmingly in favour of the natural 
look, putting cheap hair extensions, cheek piercings, heavy make-up
and dip-dyed hair in the turn-off pile.

They also said no-no to jumpsuits, clumpy boots with little dresses, 'hooker heels', chipped nail varnish and having G-strings on display.

And when it came to looks the girls don't like on the boys, low-hanging or salmon pink jeans, baseball caps balancing on the back of the head, fake tans and girly scarves were all greeted with a grimace.

In terms of fashion idols, women
would most like their men to dress like David Beckham or George 
Clooney, with Harry Styles, Brad Pitt and Gary Barlow also making the top ten.

Meanwhile, men favoured the styles of Holly Willoughby and the 
Duchess of Cambridge, with Kelly Brook and Victoria Beckham proving popular.

The study of 1,000 men and 1,000 women also highlighted how women are far more
likely to judge the opposite sex by the clothes they have on: 64 per cent
of women make judgements compared to 48 per cent of men.

Women are also less likely to accept a date if the suitor is badly 
dressed: only 47 per cent would accept a date with someone who has bad 
fashion sense compared to 55 per cent of men.

However, men are marginally more 
likely to let fashion get in the way of a good relationship, as 11 per 
cent have broken up with a girl because they couldn’t stand the way she 
dressed, compared to nine per cent of women.

But
this might be because women are more likely to try and change the way a
partner dresses by shopping for them, and gradually redesigning their 
wardrobe.

Nearly half of women polled have tried to 'educate' their boyfriend in the fashion stakes by advising him on his appearance.

Men
and women agreed that when it comes to who has more style women have better 
knowledge and understanding of what makes a 'good look'.

And men are more likely to get it wrong when making decisions about their outfit.

Brix Smith-Start, spokeswoman and 
judge for new TLC TV series Shopaholic Showdown, which commissioned the 
study of 1,000 men and 1,000 women, said: 'As this survey demonstrates, 
first impressions really do count.

'Men
in a beautifully cut suit are bound to make a good impression - Jude 
Law epitomises chic style and Harry Styles style is current and modern 
and clearly adored by millions of women.

Men said they preferred women to dress in the conservative style of the Duchess of Cambridge, left, or like TV presenter Holly Willoughby, right

'No,
no’s would be three quarter-length trousers on men, it’s a style that 
will never work. Equally tracksuits with brand names scrawled across 
them are a heinous crime against fashion.'

She
continued: 'Women like Tilda Swinton always get it right - she is so 
bold when it comes to clothes and style. Holly Willoughby’s style is 
much more conventional so you can see why men love her look.'
