Just six people successfully enrolled in health insurance plans through healthcare.gov during the first day of the Obamacare system's operation, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services meeting notes released Thursday night by a congressional committee.

By the end of the second day, a total of 248 people nationwide had bought insurance policies through the federal government's online portal, whose disastrous launch has become the stuff of late-night TV jokes and a Saturday Night Live skit.

The bombshell documents reflect summaries of 'war room' meetings held at least twice a day during the system's chaotic start by a technology working group inside the Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight, a CMS division tasked with putting the website's plan into action.

Turned over by a private Obamacare contractor at the request of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee,
not by the Obama administration, the four pages paint a picture of a 
multidisciplinary team trying to right a sinking ship, and collecting 
statistics as it takes on water.

We signed up how many? President Obama will have a new round of explaining to do, now that enrollment numbers have leaked out of a 'war room' set up to solve the healthcare.gov website's countless tech problems

The committee issued a subpoena for 
similar documents from the Department of Health and Human Services after
the agency stalled for three weeks on requests from chairman Rep. Darrell Issa.

Committee staff provided the documents to reporters on Thursday 
evening while the White House was in the middle of a trick-or-treating 
event for children of military families.

The Obama administration has said publicly that 4.7 million unique website visitors came to healthcare.gov in its first 24 hours beginning at midnight on Tuesday, October 1.

But war room meeting notes from the following morning showed that 'six enrollments have occurred so far with 5 different [insurance] issuers.'

The lucky few chose insurance policies with BlueCross BlueShield North Carolina; BlueCross BlueShield Kansas City; the Ohio-headquartered CareSource; and Healthcare Service Corporation, a Chicago-based company that sells BlueCross BlueShield plans in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas,

By the afternoon of Oct. 2, war room meeting notes reflected 'approximately 100' successful enrollments. That number grew, modestly, to a total of 248 by day's end, according to notes from the morning meeting on Oct. 3.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner refused to provide hard numbers to the House Ways and Means Committee on October 29, saying only that 'We'll have that information available until mid-November'

Kiss of death: A website that wasn't adequately tested, and was built for a relatively small traffic load, had no chance on day one, and the enrollment figures are proof

Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters told the Fox News Channel on Thursday evening that the documents 'appear to be notes' and don't reflect official totals, which the agency has repeatedly said it plans to withhold until mid-November.

'We are focused on providing reliable and accurate information and we do not have that at this time. ... We have always anticipated that the pace of enrollment will increase throughout the enrollment period,' she said.

Hedging his bets? On Oct. 21, Obama said 'the number of people who have visited the site has been overwhelming ... [and] thousands of people are signing up'

The full open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act will last for six months, ending March 31. By then, the administration hopes 7 million Americans will enroll in medical insurance plans through healthcare.gov and the similar websites run by 14 states and the District of Columbia.

At that rate, the government needs to find about 38,500 new paid enrollees every day, on average.

some of the state-run programs have faced their own challenges. Halfway through October, Delaware's exchange reported signing up just one person, Alaska had enrolled seven, and Wisconsin's total was less than 50.

By October 18, Oregon conceded that it hadn't yet processed any applications for private insurance through its exchange.

Sources inside HHS told MailOnline in mid-October that 52,000 people nationwide had completed applications for coverage by the end of the first week of October.

That number likely included consumers whose applications weren't processed immediately, but also a much larger number who elected to sign up for Medicaid coverage instead of enrolling in plans they will pay for themselves.

Those Medicaid enrollments will add only to the overall cost of the Affordable Care Act – unlike private insurance policies, whose premiums will subsidize the expense of medical care provided to others in the system.

Pants on fire? 'We do not have any reliable data around enrollment,' insisted HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on October 30 during a congressional hearing. 'The system isn't functioning, so we're not getting reliable data'

House oversight committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, an anti-Obamacare partisan, released the documents on Thursday night, which his committee got from a private contractor doing work on the Obamacare website

Numbers from the war room meetings include only the successful sign-ups completed through healthcare.gov, not through any of the state-based insurance exchanges.

They also, according to an HHS spokesperson who talked to CBS News, do not include applications from people who chose to fill out paper applications or register by telephone.

But those other methods, along with assistance from 'navigator' program helpers, also rely on the website. Cal center operators and navigators enter consumers' information into the website in real-time, and a contractor enters handwritten information into the website days or weeks after ink hits paper.

Given the tech woes that plagued healthcare.gov early on – and continue to knock it offline on a regular basis – it's unlikely anyone had significantly greater success.

Medical insurance industry consultant Robert Laszewski told Fox News that 'the White House does not want insurance companies talking about what's going on here.'

'If four weeks ago the enrollment numbers were public,' he said, 'it would look very bad. I can tell you based upon the information that I continue to get, this trickle of enrollment ... for the first three days has really continued for the first month.'
