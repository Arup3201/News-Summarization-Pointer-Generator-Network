A prisoner was killed in a high-speed car chase with police after breaking out through the roof of an Arkansas jail with his cellmate.

Stephen Mitchell, 39, who had been on remand at the Jackson County Detention Centre facing a charge of first-degree battery, died yesterday afternoon pursued by police in Missouri.

He and fellow prisoner Steven Reed, 22, had escaped late on Sunday night after removing a light fixture from the ceiling of a cell that was in a surveillance camera blind spot.

The pair had worked at the hole left until it was big enough to climb through into the jail's attic, from where they were able to escape on to the roof, ABC News reported.

Reed was recaptured on Monday evening in a nearby rural community, but Mitchell was not found until the next day, when a Missouri highway patrol officer stopped a White Nissan Sentra for speeding and spotted him inside.

Mitchell's wife, Jessica, was driving the car, with her husband in the front passenger seat. But as she stepped out of the vehicle to answer the patrolman's questions, the fugitive leapt into the driver's seat and sped off.

He got away, but hours later Missouri police again spotted the car and gave chase - until a catastrophic car wreck ended his bid for freedom, and his life.

Jackson County Sheriff David Lucas told ABC News: 'During the pursuit, Mitchell wrecked his vehicle and sustained fatal injuries, which led to his death.'

Missouri police are investigating the cause of Mitchell's accident.

His wife placed in custody in Mountain View, Missouri, awaiting an extradition hearing to be returned to Arkansas, where police hoped to question her about any involvement in the escape.

Reed, Mitchell's co-escapee, was meanwhile charged with first-degree escape and sent back to jail with bail set at $1million. Before his escape he had been awaiting transportation back to state prison for a parole violation.

Mitchell and Reed's escape was not discovered until Monday morning, some ten hours after they broke out of jail, giving them a considerable headstart on police.

Sheriff Lucas said conditions at Jackson County Detention Center had not helped matters. The jail is designed for 26 prisoners but usually holds around 50.

'I am not making excuses, but it is hard when you have limited staff and are underfunded and overcrowded,' he said.
