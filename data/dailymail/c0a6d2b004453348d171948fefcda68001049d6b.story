Manchester United's winning run was extended to six games on Sunday, largely because of superb performance from Spanish goalkeeper David de Gea.

De Gea produced a string of excellent saves to deny Liverpool, to continue a magnificent season for the United keeper.

And, as United took advantage of De Gea's brilliance, fans responded on the internet with a new set of virals to mark the occasion.

The hashtag #ThingsDavidDeGeaCouldSave began trending as Twitter users posted pictures of De Gea saving everything from the Titanic to Albus Dumbledore in Harry Potter. 

Sportsmail brings you the best of the virals:
