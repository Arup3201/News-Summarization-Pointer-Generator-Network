Golf fans are in for a rude surprise when they book accommodation to watch the Ryder Cup live in Scotland later this month.

Hotel prices in the towns surrounding Gleneagles - where the biennial USA-Europe golf tournament is held - have increased by up to 155 per cent, according to online hotel comparison site Trivago.co.uk.

Perth, the city nearest to Gleneagles, experienced the highest rise in prices with a one-night stay costing an average of £254, up 155 per cent from the preceding weekend.

Hot ticket: Cities near Gleneagles, where the Ryder Cup 2014 will be held this month, are increasing hotel room rates by up to 155% over the tournament weekend

The most expensive night to book is Saturday 27 when a hotel stay will cost an average of £322.

Hotel prices have also increased during the practice days, from 23 to 25 September, with an average rate of £200, double that being achieved from 19 to 21 September.

With Gleneagles located near the small town of Auchterarder, most spectators are staying in nearby cities, such as Perth, which is 18 miles away, Stirling (19 miles), Dundee (40 miles), Edinburgh (43 miles) or Glasgow (45 miles).

During the tournament, average room rates in Stirling are increasing by 127% to £233, in Edinburgh by 37% to £172, Glasgow by 40% to £138 and Dundee by 63% to £140.

Denise Bartlett, UK public relations for Trivago told The Caterer: 'Edinburgh and Glasgow have been in the news recently for their hotel price hikes during the Fringe Festival (an increase of 36%) and the Commonwealth Games (up 158%). 

Hot competition: Rory McIlroy has been confirmed as part of the European team for the golf tournament, to be held 25 to 28 September

'Despite the criticism, hoteliers in Perth and Stirling appear to be persisting with the price rises, with costs increasing to over double the amount of the preceding weekend.

'With the Ryder Cup taking place in a relatively isolated location, it is not often that Perth and Stirling experience this volume of visitors." 

Earlier this week the European team was confirmed, with Rory McIlroy, Stephen Gallacher, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood among those joining captain Paul McGinley.
