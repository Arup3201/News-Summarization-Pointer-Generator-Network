A Chinese woman claims to have been left with burn marks on her face from her iPhone 5S, which have still not healed a month later.

Su Jing, 31, from the city of Zhuzhou in south-eastern China’s Hunan Province, was having a long phone conversation with her boyfriend when she noticed the device had got very hot and felt some discomfort on her face.

She thought the pain was only temporary, but the marks still remain a month on.

Ms Jing says she only noticed the burn, which is across the left side of her face, when a colleague pointed it out to her at work.

iPhone 5S: The device which has left Ms Jing with an electrical burn

She went to the doctors and was told she had received an electrical burn, and although not life-threatening, she was advised to visit specialists at a hospital instead.

Ms Jing said she called customer service in China about the apparent defect in the phone, to which she was told the head office would be contacted about taking her phone in for repairs.

This is the latest in a number of incidents which have left people with nasty burns from their iPhones.

Earlier this month 18-year-old Jake Parker was scarred for life after he fell asleep on his iPhone 5 - which then burnt a two-inch hole into his arm. 

And in February, a teenage girl was left with second degree burns caught fire while in her back pocket at school.

The 14-year-old had just arrived for her French class at a middle school in Kennebunk, Maine, when the device spontaneously set alight and burnt her thigh and back. 

In China, Apple leases its retailer rights to third-party vendors, which makes it difficult to find the party directly responsible in Ms Jin's case.

MailOnline is awaiting response from Apple.
