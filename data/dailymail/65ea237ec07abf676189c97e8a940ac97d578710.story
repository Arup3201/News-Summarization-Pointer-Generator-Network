First Minister Alex Salmond claims Scotland will be richer after independence

After independence Scots will either be £1,400 a year out of pocket or £950 better off, according to rival reports published this morning.

Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander claimed Scottish voters would be throwing away a 'UK dividend' of £25 a week if they voted Yes to independence in September.

He spoke out as the Treasury published a new report on Scotland's finances in the 20 years after independence.

Mr Alexander argued that leaving the UK would mean lower tax revenues north of the border and increased public spending, leaving Scots £1,400 a year worse off.

The UK Government minister said a separate Scotland could face higher interest payments on Government debts, at the same time as it had to deal with falling oil revenues and an ageing population.

Speaking on a visit to Edinburgh, Mr Alexander said: 'Because as a United Kingdom we can pool resources and share risks, it means a UK dividend of £1,400 a year for every man, woman and child in Scotland.

'That dividend is our share of a more prosperous future. It is the money that will pay for better public services and a fairer society.'

But Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said Scotland could be £5billion a year better off in 15 years' time without having to raise taxes if it became independent - amounting to just under £100 a year for each Scot.

He said an increase of 0.3 percentage points in the long run productivity growth rate could raise an additional £2.4 billion a year in revenues by 2029/30.

Meanwhile, upping the number of people in work by 3.3 per cent could provide additional revenues of £1.3 billion a year, according to a paper released by the Scottish Government.

A rise in the population, which is less than the UK as a whole is expected to see, could net a further £1.5 billion a year by 2029/30, it argues.

Mr Salmond said the Outlook For Scotland's Public Finances paper 'gives a very clear picture of what independence could deliver in economic terms for the people of Scotland'.

But Mr Alexander said some of the claims the SNP were making were 'utterly preposterous'

He pointed to Treasury analysis which said there would be a £2.7 billion cost for setting up a new Scottish state - which was based on a £15 million estimated cost for setting up each of 180 policy departments.

However Professor Patrick Dunleavy, whose work was used as the basis of the report, said 'the Treasury has badly misrepresented the research of the London School of Economics'.

Mr Salmond said the Treasury had been 'caught red-handed trying to cook the books'.

He said: 'This leaves the Treasury claims about Scotland's finances without a shred of credibility.'

Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney added: 'The UK Government has been caught fiddling the books as they have tried to undermine confidence in Scotland about the steps that we can take towards independence.'

He said: 'Scotland will start life as an independent nation with access to our own wealth and a key stake in the £1.3 trillion of assets built up by the UK and funded by Scottish taxpayers.'

Mr Swinney added: 'In the case of physical assets overseas or defence assets that cannot be transferred or shared with Scotland, then the result will be for Scotland to receive a cash share of their value or to see our share of UK debts reduced.

'The UK Government is very keen to talk about the debt we have built up or to invent costs, but rarely talks about the assets that have been accumulated and for which Scotland has paid.'

Former Chancellor Alistair Darling is leading the 'Better Together' campaign against independence, but has been criticised for his lackluster campaign

But Mr Alexander insisted that Prof Dunleavy's work 'doesn't form part of the building blocks of the analysis we are publishing today'.

This research estimated it could cost up to on per cent of a country's economy to establish a new state - which in Scotland's case would be £1.5 billion.

Mr Alexander said: '£1.5 billion is the figure we use in our analysis today, but it's dwarfed by the massive deficit, the extra deficit, that an independent Scotland would have.'

Mr Swinney added on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that analysis showed an independent Scotland would have been £8.3 billion better off compared to the rest of the UK over the last five years.

The Lib Dem minister said Scotland would be starting off with a deficit about twice the size of the rest of the UK, which would necessitate higher taxes or substantial spending cuts.

Mr Alexander stood by the Treasury analysis in relation to Prof Dunleavy's figures and pointed out that a leaked memo of Mr Swinney's previously suggested that setting up the tax system alone would cost £600 million.
