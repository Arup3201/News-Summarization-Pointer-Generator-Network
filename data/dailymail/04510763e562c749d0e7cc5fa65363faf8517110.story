The amount of rubbish each of us recycled went down last year for the first time in three decades.

The setback follows three years in which the growth in household rubbish recycling had slowed to  a crawl.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs revealed that in the past year the amount of recycled material produced by the average individual in England actually fell, from 186kg (410lb) per person to 185kg (407.8lb).

After three years in which the growth in household rubbish recycling had slowed to a crawl, the amount of rubbish each of us recycled went down last year for the first time in three decades

No similar fall has been recorded since the early 1980s. The amount recycled by each individual more than doubled between 2004 – when fortnightly bin collections were introduced – and 2011.

The department admitted earlier this year that published recycling figures are already ‘overestimates’ as a high proportion of material is too contaminated to be used.

Instead the rejected rubbish is sent to landfill or incinerators.

Between 2004 and 2010 recycling rates in England more than doubled, from 17.8 per cent of all the household waste collected to 39.7 per cent.

The improvement from 2010 to 2012 was much slower, raising the recycling rate to 43 per cent.

Much of this improvement has been caused by the reduction in the amount of rubbish left out, a result of council restrictions on collections.

The amount of household waste collected in England, including recycling material, has fallen from 25.7million tons in 2005 to 22.9million last year.

Total weight of recycling material collected from homes went up by just 1.25 per cent in the 12 months to March 2012, from 9.7 million tonnes to 9.8 million tonnes.

The recycling figures worked out according to how much recycling is produced by each individual take into account the effect on rubbish collections of the country’s fast-rising population.

Numbers of people in the country have been going up by around 400,000 a year since 2005.
