When Arsene Wenger trudged down the dressing-room tunnel at half-time, he looked like a man who was entering the sunset of a distinguished career. Arsenal were three goals down, their fans were numb and silent and the Stoke hordes were gloating fit to burst.

Forty-five minutes later, with his side falling just a stride short of an extraordinary recovery, the manager’s head was higher. Yet he knew he had suffered a deeply damaging result. To make his mood still worse, he must have known that the score flattered Arsenal; that their recovery owed more to happy chance than to an urgent search for self-respect.

Wenger delayed public criticism of his own team, initially offering a relatively tepid: ‘In every single game, you have to be committed and focused from the first moment.’ Later, his reaction was more scathing.

For, during those first 45 minutes, Stoke’s football was taken straight from the training ground. From the 19th second, when their opening goal hit the net, just about everything they attempted came off triumphantly. Festering enmity, along with a conviction that they have been consistently patronised by Wenger down the years, means that Arsenal are the scalp they treasure above all — and they set about claiming it with killing haste.

Arsenal’s belated retrieval of their dignity finally foundered on the dismissal of Calum Chambers for a second yellow card, a poor decision which Wenger protested. But since his team had been helped along their way with a harsh penalty award, they attracted scant sympathy.

That early goal was finely executed, yet abjectly defended. A ball played deep down the right was worked along the line to Steven Nzonzi via the head of Peter Crouch. The cross found Crouch leaping once again, causing chaos in the Arsenal defence.

A rebound was procured and Crouch was left with a simple chance. Nineteen seconds and the stadium was booming out the anthems of triumph.

Arsenal needed swift retaliation and they should have secured it after 10 minutes when Olivier Giroud missed a headed chance inside the six-yard box. But that was almost the sum total of Arsenal’s contribution. They accepted their fate all too easily.

The crowd raised the noise level higher and their team responded. In the 35th minute, Stoke took a second goal of blissful simplicity, with Jonathan Walters whipping his diagonal cross to the brink of the six-yard box and Bojan stealing in to take the decisive touch.

Arsenal’s shoulders, already sagging, sunk still further and genuine humiliation stared them in the face. They were listless beyond reason, second to every significant ball. For a team of elevated ambition, it was a genuinely wretched performance.

‘Two-nil to the rugby team,’ chorused the crowd, who have not forgotten Wenger’s ancient jibe.

The Arsenal manager never left his seat. ‘They love me so much here, I didn’t want to give them the opportunity to show me their love,’ he said, his sarcasm heavier than his central defenders’ touch. And then, on the brink of half-time, it got even better for Stoke. A corner saw Crouch winning yet another header and Walters zestfully belting the chance into the roof of the net.

Arsenal raised their game in the second half, the alternative being impossible. Danny Welbeck replaced Hector Bellerin and, in the 56th minute, Alexis Sanchez struck a post, having gone past three defenders and the keeper. Scoring was easier.

But in the 65th minute they might have gone four down when Bojan skipped inside a non-existent challenge and drove his shot inside the post. ‘Everyone in the ground thought that was a goal but the ref saw an offside,’ said Mark Hughes. ‘At 4-0 it would have been over.’

Instead, the match went slightly mad. In the 68th minute, Arsenal were awarded what looked the softest penalty when Mathieu Flamini ran into the box and Mame Diouf was harshly adjudged to have made contact. Santi Cazorla devoured the kick and Arsenal belatedly discovered the urgency they had sought.

Two minutes later, they had a second; a corner clearing players in the middle and Aaron Ramsey made his first emphatic contribution with a thumping volley. For the only time in the game, the ground fell silent, transfixed by the unthinkable.

But then Chambers made an innocuous challenge and Anthony Taylor flaunted a second yellow. It seemed an absurdly unfair way to be sent off, but it killed the contest. Having watched Crouch fling arms and elbows all afternoon, Wenger was justified in taking offence.

Yet it proved decisive. There was no coming back for Arsenal. And in truth, they deserved no better.
