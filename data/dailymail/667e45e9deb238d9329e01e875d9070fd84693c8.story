Jailed: Wayne Redman, 34, has admitted grooming a 12-year-old girl on the internet and molesting her

A soldier who groomed a 12-year-old girl on Facebook while he was serving in Afghanistan has been jailed.

Wayne Redman, a former bomb disposal expert for the Army, told the schoolgirl he was in love with her and would kill himself if they could not be together.

He sent her thousands of messages, even continuing his online advances while he was on a tour of duty defusing explosives.

The 34-year-old soldier told the girl he wanted to get her pregnant, and groped her under her shirt while they watched a film together.

Redman's crimes were uncovered in 
December last year when the 12-year-old's mother stumbled upon the sick 
messages he had sent her daughter.

He
was sent home from Afghanistan, arrested and charged with sexual 
activity with a child and two counts of inciting a child to engage in 
sexual activity.

Redman pleaded guilty to the charges in March, and was yesterday jailed for three years at Peterborough Crown Court.

John
Farmer, prosecuting, told the court that in his Facebook messages the 
soldier asked the girl about her underwear, said he wanted to have sex 
with her and suggested they run away together.

'This is one of the most comprehensive cases of grooming your honour is likely to encounter,' the lawyer said.

'His ambition to have sexual intercourse with her was frustrated by chance when the young girl left her Facebook account unprotected.

'Her mother found it and obviously, very properly, started the chain of events that brings the case here.'

Among the 270 pages of online conversations presented to the court, Redman was found to have told the girl: 'Oh baby I want to get you pregnant.'

Redman was said to have had 'a promising career in the Armed Forces' before he was discharged from the Army on April 19 in the wake of the charges against him.

His former captain described him in a letter as being punctual, reliable and trustworthy, with an excellent work ethic.

Ben Long, mitigating, told the court Redman accepted 'full responsibility', and had shown remorse, regret and embarrassment.

He said Redman told him: 'I can't believe how stupid I have been.'

Mr Long said the soldier had been on the verge of tears every time he had spoken to him and had been suffering from depression and was taking anti-depressants.

He added: 'The defendant wishes to make it clear how incredibly sorry he is to all concerned that this ever took place.'

Redman, from Eaton Socon in Cambridgeshire, was made to sign the sex offenders register, banned from working with children and ordered to pay a Â£120 victim surcharge.
