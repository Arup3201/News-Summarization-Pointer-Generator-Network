A terrified patient mistakenly thought he had died during surgery after being given a full anaesthetic without his knowledge.

John Carr, 65, had gone in for routine elective surgery to ease aches and pains in his right shoulder caused by arthritis - but was put to sleep in a potentially lethal medically induced coma.

He only began to wake 20 hours after the procedure at Tameside Hospital in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester unable to see a thing and hearing murmuring voices in the darkness.

Nightmare: John Carr was supposed to be mildly sedated for surgery for arthritis pain. Instead he was given a full anaesthetic and woke 20 hours later - paralysed, unable to see and only hearing voices

The incident occurred despite Mr Carr’s orthopaedic surgeon warning doctors at the hospital - not to proceed with a general anaesthetic because it might be deadly due to his angina and heart problems.

'The hospital acted like a bull in a china shop with my treatment,' said Mr Carr, from Stalybridge. 'I remember waking up sometime after the operation and honestly thought I was dead.

'It was just total blackness and not just the sort you get when you close your eyes. I was hearing voices but unable to see anything.

'I was terrified as I was totally paralysed. I even cursed myself for believing that when you died all your senses left you because this was obviously not true as I could still hear voices. I feel really angry the hospital put me at risk like that.

'The way the staff behaved was like in a death camp of the modern world. If I knew what they were going to do then what I knew now I wouldn’t have gone through with it.'

Mr Carr had developed arthritis as a result of heavy lifting during his job as a self employed plumber and kitchen fitter.

He had been due to undergo a local 
anaesthetic-type procedure known as as an Interscaline Pain Block with 
mild sedation on the nerve so he would be awake .

But
 on the day of the surgery, the hospital’s two anaesthetists were on 
leave despite a letter to the hospital’s Department of Anaesthesia 
asking that someone be available.

Oversight: Mr Carr has received a letter from Tameside Hospital admitting there had been 'a failure in internal communication' during a staff handover

A review of his medical records was held during an anaesthetic assessment, but it was agreed that general anaesthetic would only be administered to Mr Carr in a life saving procedure.

Mr Carr added: 'I explicitly said I couldn’t have the general anaesthetic and that it was on my notes.

'I was told my heart was not strong enough to have it and it could lead to another heart attack and then death.

'I said I wasn’t going to sign for it but the doctor in duty that day told me he didn’t do pain blocks. I told him to find someone who did. I feel really angry that they put me at risk.'

Mr Carr said he was then seen by another doctor who Mr Carr believed would carry out the procedure who injected him with 'a white cloudy liquid'.

He added: “That was the last thing I remember. At no stage was there any discussion about any procedure, any risks, what drugs were being used, and how the assumed sedation would work. No one came by with the consent form to do the operation.”

Before eventually coming round properly, Mr Carr drifted in and out of consciousness saying he was experiencing symptoms similar to 'psychedelic trips'.

He said: 'I regained my sight later on and slowly the use of my limbs. This was when I recall coming round to be met by staff. I gestured to one to give me a pen and paper and I asked him if I was dying.

'When he said no and then asked him if I’d had a stroke as this seemed more plausible because of the paralysis. It was only when he said no and that I realised I was going to be okay.

'The hospital have overstepped the mark by operating without my consent. I should have been safeguarded. With my previous operations their first words are ‘have you consented’.

'I didn’t invite them to do what they did to me and in no way am I culpable. I was truly honest with them and said I didn’t feel like my heart was good enough for the operation under general anaesthetic, I know my own body. It’s fate that I’m still here today.

Scared: Before eventually coming round, Mr Carr says he experienced symptoms similar to 'psychedelic trips'

'It was there in black and white not to proceed with the general anaesthetic, it was blatantly obvious. It’s not rocket science. I’m bewildered that it happened, it was not as if it was written in a foreign language.

'They still haven’t given me a reason as to why they gave me a general anaesthetic. The two people who do that procedure were both off that day. You would think they should have just said they couldn’t go ahead but they just did.'

Mr Carr complained to PALS (Patient Advice and Liaison) and the complaints team at Tameside Hospital and received a letter admitting there had been 'a failure in internal communication' during a staff handover.

In a statement, John Goodenough, Director of Nursing at Tameside Hospital said: 'A plan of action was agreed with Mr Carr and we acknowledge there were communication difficulties during the procedure.

'However, the clinical decision was made in the interest of patient safety.'

In 2009 the hospital was identified as having the third highest mortality rate in England. Last July two previously unpublished critical reviews commissioned by the hospital emerged which revealed concerns about chronic under-staffing and sub-standard care.
