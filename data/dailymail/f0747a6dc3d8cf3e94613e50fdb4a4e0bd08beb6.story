A Fort Lewis mother of two fantasized about dismembering a seven-year-old girl while collecting child porn, federal prosecutors claim.

Sarah Wales, 32, allegedly collected and distributed child rape photos while living at  Washington-based military installation Joint Base Lewis-McChord, where her partner was stationed, in 2013.

She also reportedly used a Canadian instant messaging service to describe her fantasy of sexually assaulting a young girl, before killing her and dismembering her body.

Last Tuesday, Wales was arrested  in Spokane following a year-long investigation. She has been charged with three counts of distributing child pornography and one count of possessing it.

The FBI began investigating Wales in June 2013 after the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received a tip from the IM service that there were suspicious activities on Wales's account.

They discovered she had been using the site to swap stories about children being raped and beaten, a court filing by an FBI agent with the South Sound Child Exploitation Task Force alleges.

During the exchanges, Wales even told other users that she had sexually assaulted children, while trading pornographic images and videos of youngsters, it is claimed.

In August 2013, Wales was interviewed by the FBI, who also searched her home at Fort Lewis.

During the interviews, she told agents her online conversations were 'disgusting' but 'strictly role playing', according to charging papers obtained by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

'Wales stated that she received all her images containing child pornography from other members of the chat room,' an FBI agent told the court..

'She then stored and traded these images to other chat room members.'

Court: Wales has been charged with three counts of distributing child pornography and one count of possessing it. She is scheduled to appear at the U.S. District Court (pictured) in Tacoma on Friday

Joint Base Lewis-McChord, or JBLM, is home to the U.S. military's I Corps and 62d Airlift Wing. The facility is an amalgamation of the Army's Fort Lewis and the Air Force's McChord Force Air Base. 

As well as a training and mobilization center, it offers housing and leisure facilities for servicemen and their families.

Wales, who was released yesterday following a preliminary hearing, is scheduled to appear at the U.S. District Court in Tacoma on Friday.
