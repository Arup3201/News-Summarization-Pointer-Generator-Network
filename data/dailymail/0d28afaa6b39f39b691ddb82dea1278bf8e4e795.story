Protesters today held a demonstration against the controversial natural gas extraction process called fracking - on a village green opposite the Chancellor's constituency office.

The process of fracking, which extracts shale gas deposits from beneath the earth, has been proposed at numerous sites across the British countryside.

Chancellor George Osborne is one of the main supporters of shale gas energy - which has been proposed in his own Tatton constituency in Cheshire.

Greenpeace campaigners today spent several hours operating a 'fake fracking' work site in Tatton's main town of Knutsford in protest against the plans before closing it down this afternoon.

The campaigners also took over a local Conservative club and unveiled a huge banner down the side of the building.

The front page of Greenpeace’s website was dedicated to the anti-fracking protest for the day, with a live webcam and statements supporting their cause.

A statement on the site said: 'Fracking 
is a dangerous gamble that will threaten local environments, derail 
efforts to tackle climate change and cost green jobs and investment.

'Across the street from his office is a beautiful village green where teams of activists have constructed a huge fake fracking operation - to show the Chancellor what his gas nightmare will look like.'

Chief Inspector Paul Carroll of Cheshire Police said: 'Police attended a peaceful protest at George Osborne's constituency office in Manchester Road in Knutsford.

'In total approximately 25 people from Greenpeace were at the location.

'Most of the protesters left by 2.30pm. There were no issues, no one was arrested, and there was no impact on the traffic in the area.

'There was a police presence as the role of the constabulary is to impartially allow for peaceful protesting, whilst ensuring that others can continue unhindered in their legitimate business activities, or commuting.'

The controversial technique to extract shale gas - known as fracking - uses a high-pressured mix of water and chemicals to force out reserves from deep layers of rock.

Campaigners claim drilling could scar the British countryside, pollute water supplies, and clog roads with hundreds of lorries transporting gas and dirty water.

In the U.S., fracking has led to local contamination of water with methane and the extraordinary spectacle of people being able to set fire to the water coming out of their taps because of the gas content.

Greenpeace environmental campaigner Lawrence Carter said: 'Fracking is an unnecessary practice. We don't need fracking, we don't need shale gas when we have got low-carbon forms of energy which not only deliver but also help the economy by delivering growth.'

The process of fracking involves pumping millions of gallons of water and chemicals deep underground to force out natural gas from the surrounding layers of shale rock.

Engineers have known about shale gas for more than a century.

In 1875, Victorian geologists sank a borehole in Sussex to investigate shale, a finely grained rock - created from compressed mud - which sits in layers. When a flame was lowered into the hole, it exploded, confirming the presence of natural gas.

But getting this gas out of the ground is extremely complicated. Below the North Sea, natural gas forms in sandstone and when a drill reaches the gas, it flows out.

But shale gas is locked in dense rock. Energy companies must drill a well hundreds or thousands of feet deep to reach the layer of shale – which can be just 50 feet thick - and then turn the drill sideways to bore horizontally.

Water, chemicals and sand are pumped into the hole under enormous pressure until the rock cracks, allowing gas locked up in the shale to escape and flow upwards into the well.

This process is called hydraulic fracturing - fracking for short.

Blackpool is believed to be sitting on one of the biggest shale gas fields in the world – with a reserve of 200 trillion cubic feet lying under the Lancastrian countryside.

It’s enough gas to keep the UK going for 50 years, end reliance on imported gas from Russia and create more than 5,000 jobs.

It is ten times more than all the natural gas known to be left under the North Sea, and a fifth of the size of the world’s biggest field.

In the U.S., where fracking has been carried out for more than a decade, the process has halved the price of natural gas.

But opinion is still widely divided on shale gas.

Supporters believe it could solve the growing global energy crisis while opponents of fracking continue to argue that it is a dangerous process which should be abandoned.

Environmentalists insist the technique releases toxins and methane gas into nearby water supplies - which has already occurred in America - and scupper any chances of cutting greenhouse gases.

And after fracking caused an earthquake with a magnitude of 2.3 in Blackpool last April, there are concerns about the scale of the earthquakes it can trigger.

Fracking has already been banned in France, New York and New Jersey as well as in Quebec and parts of Switzerland.

Today's protest came with the release of a ComRes poll, conducted on behalf of Greenpeace, which found that 12 per cent of residents in Tatton who voted Conservative in the last election would be less likely to vote Tory again if fracking went ahead in the area.

'It seems George Osborne is so wedded to his dash for gas that he's willing to ignore the views of his own constituents,' Mr Carter said.

'It's time the Chancellor stopped trying to play the JR Ewing of Cheshire and concentrated on investment in clean, safe, renewable technology that will create longer term jobs and a more stable economy.'

A spokeswoman for Cheshire Police said: 'Cheshire Police have been made aware of an incident at the Knutsford Conservative Club in Manchester Road in Knutsford.

'Officers are in attendance.'

Nearly two-thirds of the country could be sitting on shale gas reserves - although estimates of how much is actually below Britain vary wildly.

Industry experts believe there may be up to four times more than the previously estimates of 300 trillion cubic feet - enough to supply Britain for many decades.

In the next few weeks, an official report by the British Geological Survey is set to be released and expected to announce deposits are far larger than previously predicted.

The Chancellor hopes the UK's energy landscape can be transformed by shale gas and help prevent the oncoming crisis - like in the U.S., where drilling has helped drive down prices.

In a bid to promote investment in shale gas, the Chancellor is set to offer lucrative tax breaks and a simplified regulatory regime to the industry.

And he has the support of David Cameron, who has also backed the technology and said Britain should be at the heart of the shale 'gas revolution', claiming it could bring down the price of household energy bills.

Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey has sounded a much more cautious note than his Conservative coalition counterparts, warning shale gas is 'unlikely' to reduce bills and is 'no silver bullet'.

However, other energy experts say flooding the market with cheap gas will set back the UK’s move to green energy.

Jenny Banks of the World Wildlife Fund said: ‘The world is heading for a rise in temperature if energy use continues as it does now.

'But if we switch to shale gas, then there’ll still be a rise. We already burn too many fossil fuels, it won’t make enough of a difference.’

And analysis by the Department of Energy and Climate Change data undertaken by Greenpeace shows the majority of licences are held by companies with a foreign firm as their only or largest investor.

Greenpeace energy campaigner Lawrence Carter said: 'The Government has earmarked nearly two thirds of England for potential fracking, despite everyone from BP to the Energy Secretary to energy regulator Ofgem saying that UK shale gas won't bring down bills.

'Now we find that over half of the drilling rights in the UK are held by companies that are significantly made up of foreign interests, including the Chinese government.

'We already know the Chancellor is offering them generous tax breaks, so you have to ask yourself how consumers and the wider economy will benefit, let alone the climate.'
