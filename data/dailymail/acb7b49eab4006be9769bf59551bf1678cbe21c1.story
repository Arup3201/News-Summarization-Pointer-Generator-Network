Three Russians have been reported to the police after they forced a cat into a tumble dryer and filmed themselves laughing as it was spun at high speed.

The shocking video shows two women and a man apparently in the bathroom of their home in the Bezhetsk in western Russia's Bezhetsky District, where they are debating about how to dry out the wet cat, which has just been bathed.

They then raise the lid on the old-style Dawoo tumble dryer and shove the pet inside, with the young woman on camera, Alyona, 21, filmed by the other saying that she was going to put it on the six-minute cycle.

The man, identified only by his first name of Ilya, and who had stuffed the cat into the tumble dryer, suggests they leave it only for a few seconds as the cat would probably die otherwise.

After switching the machine on and off, they take the cat out which is so disorientated by the high-speed cycle that it cannot even stand.

They then grab the groggy cat and drop it back almost lifeless into the spin dryer for a second cycle. 

The trio can be heard laughing as the cat at one point falls onto the floor and one of the young women makes a silly face crossing her eyes to impersonate the animal.

She says: 'I wonder what the cat is going to look like when it comes out.'

The cat, apparently named Sonya, is dumped on the floor and at the close of the video is seen walking in small circles so disorientated that she can no longer even properly stand.

The trio then shared the video online on Alyona's Russian social media where it quickly went viral, causing a massive backlash with critics calling for police to investigate.

The footage was quickly removed after that, but not before it was downloaded by other users and circulated.

A police spokesman confirmed they were looking into the incident but did not say whether any arrests have been made. 

According to Russian media, which did not provide full names for the trio, the cat has been put into a shelter where a new home is being sought for it.

After deleting the video about the incident Alyona then posted a message on social media defending herself and her friends against critics.

She said: 'To all those attacking me and my friends let me start from the beginning, don't believe all the rubbish that you read. 

'It was never our intention to kill the cat and there was no water inside the machine. 

'People who claim to have heard the sound of the cat's head bashing against the side are talking rubbish. 

'The knocking sound was only the noise of the plastic cover beating against the side. 

'And in any case, the video is now very old and the cat was not harmed. In fact it was handed over to another family a long time ago and is perfectly all right. 

'To all those who criticise my family, I say you are disgusting. You are talking about me and our parents and yet you are behaving worse than we did. 

'I ask you to draw your own conclusions about that. I also want to ask why you are so silent about everything else that is going on, which is so much worse. 

'What about the treatment of war veterans or the murder of people by all sorts of souls. Why is there no one getting so upset about Crimea but everybody going on about a cat?'
