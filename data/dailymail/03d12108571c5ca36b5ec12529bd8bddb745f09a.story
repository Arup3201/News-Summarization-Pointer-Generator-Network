Baby Gammy and his birth mother have moved into a brand new home, thanks to $250,000 raised by donations from thousands of social media users.

The 11-month-old had been living in a small one-bedroom unit in the care of his birth mother,  and through funds donated by Australians, has now moved into a three-bedroom home held in trust by charity Hands Across Water.

Baby Gammy made headlines around the world when his surrogate mother claimed that his Australian parents had abandoned him when they realised he had been born with Down syndrome, but had taken home his twin sister Pipah, who appeared to be healthy.

Despite the vulnerable financial position of his birth mother,  Pattaramon Chanbua,  baby Gammy was well cared for by the Thai woman, expressing her commitment to raising him with her husband Goy as one of her own, along with her two other children, reported 9 News.

She said, through the aid of a translator, that baby Gammy was 'her responsibility'. 

West Australian couple David and Wendy Farnell deny the claims, and say they have been tirelessly trying to bring Gammy home to be with his sister.

Ms Chanbua, 21, said that there are still health concerns for Gammy, who suffers from a lung condition as well as his diagnosis of Down syndrome. 

'He eats a lot, and his development is good', Ms Chanbua said.

Gammy's new three-bedroom house is in the same area as the Chanbua family's unit, two hours outside of Bangkok.

It has cream coloured walls and is shown to have furniture, a television set, and kids toys filling the rooms.

The Thai woman said that the move to a larger house will be of benefit to Gammy, and allowed his two other siblings, six and three, to have the 'space to run around the house'. 

Hanging above the doorframe of Gammy's new house is a sign which reads ‘A home for baby Gammy’, and Ms Chanbua has hung a photo on the wall inside of Gammy's twin sister.

Ms Chanbua expressed concern for Gammy's future if she was not there to look after him.

‘I am afraid one day if something happens to me, who will take care of him?', she asked through a translator.

A further $120,000 has been collected from donations, and has been put aside to help pay for baby Gammy's medical bills and other needs as he grows older, reported the International Business Times.  

The family reportedly has plans to add to their income by opening a noodle shop at the front of their house. 

An application to grant baby Gammy Australian citizenship was handed into the Australian embassy in Bangkok by Ms Chanbua, who hopes the citizenship will give Gammy entitlements to Australian welfare. 

It was revealed after baby Gammy made headlines that his biological father, was convicted on 22 child sex charges in the late 1990s. 

Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of Gammy's twin Pipah. 

WA Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said officers have yet to make a decision about whether she can stay in the care of her Mr Farnell.
