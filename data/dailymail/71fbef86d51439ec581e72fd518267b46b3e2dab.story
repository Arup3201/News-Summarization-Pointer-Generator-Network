Two polar bears show the real meaning of dancing on ice as they perform a graceful waltz in the freezing Canadian Arctic

Despite being some of the largest and most fearsome mammals on the planet, the two burly male bears appeared perfectly coordinated as they showed off a few moves, although they stopped short at doing the foxtrot.

Against the snowy white backdrop, the
 dancing partners appeared to draw each other close and clasp hands as 
they moved together in a tender moment.
