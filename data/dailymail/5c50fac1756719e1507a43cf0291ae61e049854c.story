Cars sit in the shadow of a volcano spilling 1200-degree-centigrade molten lava - at what could be the world's most dangerous car park.

Daredevil drivers parked their four-by-fours in the path of the thick liquid as it poured down the slopes of the Eyjafjallajvkull volcano in Iceland, which caused massive disruption across Europe when it last erupted in 2010, spewing ash high into the atmosphere.

Fearless thrill-seekers even got out of their cars to take a closer look at the lavaflow- some standing just half a metre away from the deadly liquid.

A bad place to park? Cars line up in the path of flowing lava, down the Eyjafjallajkull volcano in Iceland. The amazing images were captured by Kristjan Freyrrastarson, who said some even stood outside their cars for a better look

The daredevil drivers parked their 4x4s in the path of the thick liquid as it poured down the slopes of the Eyjafjallajkull, and some fearless thrill-seekers even got out of their cars to take a closer look at the eruption

Eyjafjallajökull, Icelandic for 'Island mountain glacier' is one of the smaller ice caps of Iceland.

The ice cap covers the caldera of a volcano with a summit elevation of 1,666 metres (5,466 ft).

The volcano has erupted relatively frequently since the last glacial period, most recently in 2010, where it  caused enormous disruption to air travel across western and northern Europe.

The unseen images were posted online by 25-year-old student Kristjan Freyr rastarson - and instantly went viral on the internet.

Within just a few days, they had received 300,000 hits - around the same as the entire population of Iceland.

Kristjan, who spent three hours travelling across a dangerous glacier in torrid weather to reach the spot, said: 'Some people were standing about half meter from the lava with their cars parked nearby.

'Recent tracks from jeep tires in the snow were disappearing under the lava - but because it was moving so slow we were not actually noticing any movements.

'The noise was really memorable - it sounded like a powerful firework display.'

He added: 'After a couple of hours, it started to get dark and the weather was getting worse.

The way to Eyjafjallajkull volcano is covered under three feet of snow and ash, in Iceland, with thrill-seekers spending up to three hours travelling on treacherous surfaces.

'We decided to turn back, but on our way back down the glacier it was snowing so badly we could only see about three meters in front of the car - so it was very easy to get lost.

'At one point we lost the vehicle in front of us for around 20 minutes.

We did not have GPS systems to tell us where to go so we were not in good place at all.

'Finally we found the other group and we continued back home.

'When I got there and looked at the photos from the trip I felt how amazing it was the be able to experience something like that.'
