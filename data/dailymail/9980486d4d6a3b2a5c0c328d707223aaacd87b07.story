A man trapped in a cave for nine hours was airlifted to hospital after falling nearly 20 metres in outback Queensland.

The 43-year-old man became trapped at the bottom of the Great Nowranie Cave at Camooweal about midday on Friday, falling nearly 20 metres and suffering a fractured ankle and lacerations on his lower leg.

After making a distressed call on his mobile, firefighters and emergency services worked through heavy rain and thunderstorms to retrieve the man  at about 9pm, reports Courier Mail.

Ambulance personnel made contact with the man before 2pm, but it took about seven hours and the assistance of firefighters to finally reach the man.

An RACQ North Queensland Rescue Helicopter transported the man to Mount Isa Hospital in a stable condition, before being treated for the injuries he sustained in the fall.

An earlier attempt to lower ambulance staff down the cave had to be abandoned after heavy rain and lightning thwarted the process.

Locals said the man likely walked too close to the edge of the cave and caused the ground to crumble, though it was also speculated that he climbed down and then injured his leg.
