A victim of a series of sickening rapes which caused national outrage in Australia says she is fearful about the imminent release of yet another member of the gang which terrorised girls just before the Sydney Olympics.

The State Parole Board of NSW has announced it will release 'H', an unidentifed member of the notorious Skaf rape gang whose degrading and racist sex crimes still shock the nation almost 14 years on.

The victim was a 16-year-old when she was raped by the gang leader, Bilal Skaf, in front of 12 men in a public park and had a gun held to her head by a second man who also raped her, before kicking her in the stomach.

The release of 'H' will mean two-thirds of the the original gang, which comprised young men of Lebanese background and included two sets of brothers, has now been freed from prison.

The victim's mother told MailOnline the release frightened her daughter, and the fact half the gang were 'out and roaming around' was a major concern.

'H' was one of  14 mostly Muslim Lebanese Australians who went on a four-week rampage orchestrated by gang leader Bilal Skaf, raping Australian women and teenage girls in Sydney in the lead up to the 2000 Olympics.

The gang members, aged between 13 and 18 years, lured the girls from shopping centres and train stations and took them to parks and public toilet blocks.

One of the victims was raped 25 times by a total of 14 men at Bankstown, in Sydney's west, in an ordeal that lasted six hours, during which the attackers subjected her to racist taunts.

They called her an 'Aussie Pig', told her she would be raped 'Leb-style' and asked if 'Leb c*** tastes better than Aussie c***'.

Afterwards, the rapists cleaned her down with a fire hose.

Two 16-year-old girls were raped repeatedly over five hours and told 'you deserve it because you're Australian'.

When police caught the gang, the available evidence allowed only nine members go to trial.

During court hearings, the men's family members abused legal and court officials.

Family members spat at the media and others, and one female relative called the Crown Prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen, SC, a 'sharmoota', which means 'whore' in Arabic.

A victim of the gangs rapes says she is fearful now two thirds of the gang has been freed from  prison , following the release of Mohamed Sanoussi (above) and that of 'H' who is due for parole in two weeks

In sentencing, Judge Michael Finnane described the rapes as events 'you hear about or read about only in the context of wartime atrocities'.

When gang leader, Bilal Skaf, aged 18 at the time of his rapes, received a maximum 55 year sentence, there was outcry among the Lebanese Australian community.

Skaf appealed and his sentence was reduced. Appeals have also reduced the compulsory jail time of the other  gang members.

'H', who was 16 years old when he participated in the rapes and who is said to have the mental age of a child, is now 30 and will walk from Sydney's Parklea Correctional Centre as early as February 18.

He is the second gang member to be set free from prison in six months, and his release will mean six members of the nine men convicted have been freed, although one, Mahmoud Sanoussi, is being held in custody on charges of allegedly bashing a cleaner in southwestern Sydney.

Mahmoud Sanoussi is now allegedly a member of Sydney's most notorious Middle Eastern gang, the Brothers For Life.

His association with the gang meant his brother and fellow Skaf gang member, Mohamed Sanoussi, could not be released to the Sanoussi family home when paroled last year.

Mohamed Sanoussi's release sparked widespread public criticism of the Australian justice system.

Sanoussi, who had successfully appealed his original sentence, which was whittled down from a 21 year maximum to 12 years served, was involved in the rapes and assaults in a park on two women who were forced to give oral sex to eight males.

Victims of Crime Assistance League campaigner Howard Brown said the existing parole system might prove insufficient to properly supervise Sanoussi on his release.

'As recent cases show there has been an erosion of public confidence in the justice system,' he said. 'When a [sex offender] will be released, we have to keep really close tabs on him.'

As MailOnline can now reveal, Mohamed Sanoussi and now 'H', join other Skaf gang rapists who have been quietly released  into the community.

Tayyab Sheikh was released to parole in June 2007, three years before the expiration of his full sentence.

Mahmoud Chami was released to parole in April 2013 and another unnamed rapist, 'T', has also been freed.

The victim's mother who spoke with MailOnine said her daughter had made a big effort to get on with her life, which was jeopardised by the new of 'yet another' release of a rape gang member.

'She has her bad days and she's not the girl she was. She has a lot of concerns about her safety and that of [her family].

'She can be very paranoid. We hope these men will be strongly monitored in the community.'

The victim's mother said it was her 'gut feeling' the two gang leaders will win early release from prison.

Bilal Skaf, now aged 32, is not eligible for parole until February 11, 2033, and his younger brother Mohammed may apply for parole on July 1, 2019.

It was Mohammed Skaf, who the victim thought was a friend, who took her to the public park where his brother raped her.

The victim's mother said every news report about the Skafs and the other rapists brought back her horrifying ideal.

'Her life is like swimming with shoes on,' the mother said.

The parole board will release 'H' later this month on 27 conditions, which include he must not communicate with anyone under the age of 16 years by text messaging or the internet, and must undergo drug and alcohol testing.
