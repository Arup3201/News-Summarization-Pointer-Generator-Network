The Football Association will meet supporters’ groups before England play the Republic of Ireland next year to reinforce messages about offensive chanting after anti-IRA songs during the Scotland game.

The England band caused a storm on Tuesday night when they played the tune while supporters sang: 'F*** the IRA' inside Celtic Park.

Roy Hodgson apologised on behalf of the FA after the friendly international won 3-1 by England, and the band have also apologised and issued an explanation, claiming they were unaware the words to a popular song had been changed for the occasion.

Celtic is a club with strong catholic links and Irish connections and the episode triggered alarm ahead of England’s first game in Dublin since February 1995, when a game at Lansdowne Road had to be abandoned due to rioting by English fans in the stands. 

The FA have followed up Hodgson’s comments with an official apology in a statement from a spokesman on Wednesday.

'We apologise for any offence caused by a section of the England support at the match with Scotland,' said a spokesman. 'The FA does not condone inappropriate and offensive chanting and intends to meet with supporters’ groups to discuss the wider issues.

'We have consistently urged supporters to show respect and not to chant songs that could be regarded as insulting to others - particularly from a religious or political perspective.

'With regard to the supporters’ band, there was contact during the match once the situation became clear. This is consistent with regular dialogue that takes place between the band and The FA.

'In also apologising, the band have given an explanation and confirmed they in no way endorse the chanting that occurred.'

England are due to play in Dublin on June 7, next year, a preparation friendly ahead of a Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia, seven days later.

The two nations met at Wembley in May last year. More than 80,000 watched a 1-1 draw in a friendly and respectful atmosphere which offers encouragement ahead of the trip across the Irish Sea.

The FA will reinforce the same messages of respect when they meet the supporters’ groups but England’s away support has a very different demographic to those who attend games at Wembley, with a hardcore of fans who have followed the team overseas for many years.

Ultimately, supporters can sing what they want. Many England fans insert 'No Surrender' into the national anthem, which is also considered to be aimed at the IRA.

At least the band have promised not to supply the tunes any more for songs which can be turned into politically offensive messages, as they unwittingly did in Scotland.

The band is made up of independent supporters, who pay their own way. They are not sponsored by the FA, although there is a relationship. The FA have helped the band overcome problems in the past when they turn up at grounds in different countries to be told they cannot take instruments through the turnstiles.

In Scotland, the FA were able to get a message through to the band to change their tune, which they did.
