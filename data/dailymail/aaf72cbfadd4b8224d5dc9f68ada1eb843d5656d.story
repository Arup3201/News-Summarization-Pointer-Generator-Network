The brother of Little Mix star Jesy Nelson has today been charged with dealing cocaine.

Johnny Nelson, 22, has also been charged with driving while disqualified after allegedly being filmed selling the drug from his Smart car in Hornchurch, Essex.

Nelson, whose mum is a Police Community Support Officer, has been bailed to appear in court in the New Year.

Jesy, 20, and her X Factor-winning 
bandmates Perrie Edwards, 18, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, 19, and Jade 
Thirlwall, 18, are proud of their squeaky-clean image.

However, The Sun newspaper claims to 
have 'exposed' brother Johnny’s trade after being given a mobile number,
described as a 24-hour 'drugs hotline'.

The reporter apparently paid £80 for 'two, inch-long rectangular wraps,' folded using lottery tickets.

There is no suggestion Jesy, of nearby
Romford, or any of her family are aware or are in any way involved.

Teetotal: Jesy claims she has 'never been drunk', and was seen clear-eyed at Glamour's Tulisa Cover Girl Celebration, at Kensington Roof Gardens this week

Her businessman dad John Nelson, 46, was jailed after an amateur boxer 
was stabbed to death outside a club 26 years ago.

He was dubbed the Disco Killer when he
was convicted of murder, but was cleared on appeal and served a shorter
sentence for affray. Jesy’s mum Janis, 51, split from John years ago.
