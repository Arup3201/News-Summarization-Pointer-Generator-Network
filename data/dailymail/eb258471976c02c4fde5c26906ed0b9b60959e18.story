Gordon Ramsay says the opening night of hist new restaurant was sabotaged by a rival making 100 fake bookings, but did not name the suspect

Gordon Ramsay may have a reputation for being one of the most brutal head chefs in the restaurant business, but it seems his rivals are capable of being equally devious.

Mr Ramsay claims that a competitor sabotaged the opening night of his new restaurant by secretly booking 100 out of 140 tables, leaving the eatery almost empty.

The television chef said staff at Heddon Street Kitchen, in London's Mayfair, were left upset and deflated, and will now have to reconfirm every booking to ensure they are not caught out again.

He refused to name the rival he believes was involved, but said it showed the 'level of envy' on the restaurant scene while speaking on the Jonathan Ross show, to be broadcast on ITV tonight.

Ramsay's new eatery is described as having a 'relaxed' atmosphere and 'modern European' menu which is ideal for 'brisk brunches and post-shopping pit stops through to lunch, dinners and after work cocktails.'

The kitchen is run by head chef Maria Tampakis who grew up New York and worked for three-Michelin starred chef Jean Georges at Cook before moving to London.

She worked briefly for Heston Blumenthal at his Knightsbridge restaurant Dinner, moved to Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen, near St Paul's Cathedral, as head sous chef before being moved to the head of Heddon Street Kitchen.

The new opening marks Ramsay's 12th restaurant in the capital, and brings his total number of eateries up to 24 worldwide - sharing seven Michelin stars between them. 

Speaking about the new restaurant, The Telegraph quoted Ramsay as saying: 'I think there's all that level of envy. Saturday was our first big day, we had 140 on the books and 100 no show.

Speaking on the Jonathan Ross show, to be broadcast tonight, Ramsay said the incident shows the 'bad spirit' and 'level of envy' involved in the professional restaurant business

Ramsay also spoke on the show about his swearing, saying he never uses fould words in front of his children, calling it 'industry language' which he only uses when he has 'a reason'

'It's bad spirit and you see the staff and they are down and frustrated, I was there to pick them up and make sure we stay focused.' 

While Ramsay may have built a highly-acclaimed restaurant empire, he is perhaps most famous for his foul-mouthed rants on shows such as Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and Hell's Kitchen.

However, he doesn't swear at home or in front of his children, he told Jonathan Ross, describing the expletives as 'industry language' which he only uses when he has 'a reason' to do so.

Ramsay's new Mayfair restaurant, his 12th in London, was opened last Saturday but was left nearly empty after 100 of the 140 booking failed to turn up

The full interview will be broadcast on the Jonathan Ross Show tonight at 9.55pm
