Under fire Toronto mayor Rob Ford has finally admitted that he smoked crack 'probably a year ago' when he was in a 'drunken stupor.'

Ford's admission to reporters on Tuesday follows six months of accusations during which the embattled mayor has repeatedly refused to step down. The allegations that he had been caught on video smoking crack surfaced in May.

'Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine,' Ford told reporters on Tuesday outside his office.

Six months after the allegations first surfaced, Toronto mayor Rob Ford admitted to reporters on Tuesday that he had smoked crack 'probably a year ago'

At a second press conference Ford made no mention of resigning or entering rehab and instead he said the people of Toronto would get to decide on his future at the ballot box

After the allegations about the crack smoking video first surfaced in May, Ford initially insisted the video didn't exist and sidestepped questions about whether he had ever smoked crack.

He was forced to backtrack after police said last week that they had obtained a copy of the video, which has not been released publicly.

'Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine,' Ford told reporters outside his office. 'There have been times when I've been in a drunken stupor. That's why I want to see the tape. I want everyone in the city to see this tape. I don't even recall there being a tape or video. I want to see the state that I was in.'

Ford walked out of his office and asked reporters to ask him the question they first asked him in May. He acknowledged he smoked it but said: 'Am I an addict? No. Have I tried it, probably in one of my drunken stupors a year ago.'

Earlier on Tuesday, Ford's brother, Doug, left, criticized Police Chief Bill Blair for saying he was 'disappointed' in the mayor

On Tuesday afternoon Ford gave a more formal press conference in which he appeared close to tears as he said that making the admission was the hardest thing he had ever done.

He then went on to say that he loved his job and he wanted to return to doing the job that he was elected to do, which he said was 'saving taxpayers money.'

Ford made no mention of either resigning or entering rehab as a result of his admission, but instead said that the people of Toronto would have the opportunity in October 2014 - and the next mayoral election - to decide at the ballot box if they wanted him to continue. 

'I was elected to do a job and that's exactly what I'm going to continue doing,' Ford said. 'On Oct. 27 of 2014, I want the people of this great city to decide whether they want Rob Ford to be their mayor.'

Ford had previously apologized for excessive drinking and other mistakes but has rebuffed pressure to step down. He had sidestepped questions about whether he has ever smoked crack until now.

Despite his admission, Ford against insisted he would not resign.

Municipal law makes no provision for the mayor's forced removal from office unless he's convicted and jailed for a criminal offense.

City Councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong, a member of Ford's executive committee, said he would put forward a motion asking Ford to take a leave of absence.

'My first reaction was "Wow",' Minnan-Wong said.

Councilor Jaye Robinson said the mayor needs to step aside and address his problems.

'We have become a laughing stock of North America, if not the world,' Robinson said.

Ford later told the Toronto Sun newspaper that he is not stepping down or taking a leave of absence.

'I feel like I got 1,000 pounds off my back,' Ford told the paper, which is sympathetic to the mayor. 'I felt like I had to say it. It is what it is. I feel two inches high right now but I needed to deal with it. I am not going to quit or take a leave.'

Earlier on Tuesday, Ford's brother, Doug, criticized Police Chief Bill Blair for saying he was 'disappointed' in the mayor. Doug Ford called the chief's comments 'inappropriate' and 'biased' and said Blair should step aside.

'We have the most political police chief we have ever seen,' said Doug Ford, a Toronto City Councillor. 'The police chief believes he's the judge, the jury and the executioner.'

Blair says he responded honestly when asked about his feelings after watching the video.

Another city councilor, John Filion, called Doug Ford's attack against the police chief 'appalling' and said the Ford brothers have 'crossed the line with not only the alleged behavior, the lack of comment on the behavior, and now attacking the people brought some of that behavior to light.'

After the allegations about the crack smoking video first surfaced in May, Ford initially insisted the video didn't exist and sidestepped questions about whether he had ever smoked crack

The allegations about Ford smoking 
crack surfaced when two reporters with the Toronto Star and one from the
U.S. website Gawker said they saw the video but they did not obtain a 
copy. Ford vilified the Toronto Star, accusing the paper of trying to 
take him down.

The mayor has
called on the chief to release the tape, but police said they are 
prohibited from doing so because it is evidence before the courts.

Police
said the video will come out when Ford's associate and occasional 
driver, Alexander Lisi, goes to trial on drug and extortion charges. 
Lisi is accused of threatening two alleged gang members who had been 
trying to sell the video to the media.

Police have said they want to talk to the mayor, but his lawyer so far has declined.
