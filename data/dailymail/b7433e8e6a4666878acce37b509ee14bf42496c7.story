The jihadists who posted pictures of themselves and one of their children wielding decapitated heads in the Middle East earlier this year reportedly went on a 'shooting party' with a prominent Sydney construction boss prior to leaving Australia.

Four Corners reported Sydney business identity George Alex, who is currently under investigation by the Trade Union Royal Commission, took militants Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar to a rural property near Lithgow, in the Central West of New South Wales in November 2013.  

The trip to the Glen Davis property was organised as a 'pick me up' for Mr Alex, the documentary program reported Mr Alex's lawyer saying, as the construction industry identity was 'suffering depression' at the time.

The ABC's Four Corners program has revealed Sharrouf and Elomar attended a 'shooting party' with construction industry boss George Alex, pictured today, last November

Mr Alex's lawyer told the program there was 'little shooting' and that it was more of a 'big barbecue'.

Police later found the property littered with used ammunition, Four Corners reported.

The program also revealed police are examining Sharrouf's links to the July 2013 murder of standover man Vasko Boskovski.

Boskovski was gunned down when he answered the door of his Earlwood home around 9:30pm AEDT on a Monday evening.

Deputy Police Commissioner Nick Kaldas told Four Corners: 'It's difficult to comment on the Boskovski murder simply because it is very much a live investigation at the moment.

'But we are aware that there was a relationship between the two of them and it is very much a part of the murder investigation that's currently afoot.' 

The ABC report also shed light on how Elomar, Sharrouf and Mr Alex became acquainted.

Karen Nettleton, the child's grandmother, fronted the Royal Commission in September and claimed Sharrouf had worked as a 'bodyguard' for Mr Alex.

But Mr Alex denied this, saying through a lawyer that he knew the pair through boxing. 

Mohammed Elomar, particularly, had been touted as as future boxing star. 

The Western Sydney militants rose to infamy in August this year after posting gruesome decapitation images on social media.

Sharrouf uploaded an image to Twitter of his seven-year-old son wielding a decapitated head in Raqqa, Syria. 

The picture was condemned by some world leaders, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry labelling it 'disgusting' and 'grotesque'.

'This image, perhaps even an iconic photograph... is really one of the most disturbing, stomach-turning, grotesque photographs ever displayed,' Mr Kerry told reporters. 

Sharrouf fled to the Middle East on his brother's passport last December. He was soon joined by his three young children and his wife, Tara Nettleton.

Ms Nettleton's truck driver father, Peter, has said he was 'totally gutted' by the picture of his grandson. 

The Federal government estimates as many as 250 Australians could be providing support, or fighting for, the Islamic State.

The most senior Australian Islamic State militant, Mohammed Ali Baryalei, was reported killed last week. 

Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said the government had not confirmed the killing. 

She said the reported incident proved the dangers of fighting for the terror group. 

'It does highlight what the government has been saying that Australians who leave this country to fight in Iraq and Syria are putting themselves in mortal danger,' she said.
