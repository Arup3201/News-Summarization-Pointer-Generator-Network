Mariusz Krezolek: A bullying thug who used his training in the Polish Army to inflict further pain on Daniel

Bull-necked Mariusz Krezolek used his experience of a year in the Polish Army to devise punishment exercises he knew would hasten Daniel Pelka's emaciation.

The powerfully-built plasterer, who worked in an automotive plant while living in Coventry, forced his starving stepson to use precious calories performing squats and other energy-sapping drills.

Also a trained brick-layer, Krezolek once told a work colleague that Daniel was 'retarded' and should be sent back to his biological father in Poland.

Krezolek, who boasted at work about having served jail sentences for driving offences, told the colleague in the summer of 2011: 'It's not even worth beating him because he won't feel pain as he's autistic.'

In other disturbing comments, Krezolek also informed the same work-mate that Daniel was 'all f***** up' and 'a very bad person'.

Born in the small town of Trzebnica in south-western Poland in June 1979, Krezolek showed not a shred of remorse during 17 hours and six minutes in the witness box.

The former soldier was accused of faking tears and even grinned in the absence of the jury as he sought to minimise his role during five days of testimony.

In his at times heart-breakingly callous account, Daniel's stepfather admitted he would not have subjected a child of his own to the punishments and cruelties Daniel was forced to endure.

On his fourth day in the witness box, 
Krezolek appeared to take pleasure from confirming he and Luczak had sex
 on the eve of their arrest, two nights after Daniel died.

The
 following exchange then took place between Krezolek - who said Daniel 
had been 'pushed to the back burner' - and prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC.

Krezolek angered several jurors when he feigned distress while looking at black and white CT scans of Daniel's body

Mr Hankin: 'I am interested to know how you were able to treat a little boy in the way that you did, was it because he was not your own flesh and blood?'

Krezolek: 'It happened because I simply wanted to satisfy Magda.'

Mr Hankin: 'You had no respect for Daniel as a human being did you?

Krezolek: 'I did.'

Mr Hankin: 'When was the last time you cuddled him?'

Krezolek once told a work colleague that Daniel was 'retarded' and should be sent back to his biological father in Poland

Krezolek: 'I cannot remember. He simply didn't come for cuddling.'

Mr Hankin: 'You have told the jury that little boy lived in the shadow of alcoholism and violence. Who in the quiet periods needed care more than Daniel?'

Krezolek: 'Of course it was needed for Daniel more than anyone else but it was the arguments that made a man simply think about something else.'

Mr Hankin: 'When was the last time in life you tucked him into bed?'

Krezolek: 'I cannot remember.'

Mr Hankin: 'Read him a bed-time story?'

Krezolek: 'I cannot remember.'

Mr Hankin: 'When did you bathe him?'

Krezolek: 'I cannot remember.'

Mr Hankin: 'When was the last time in life you played with him?'

Krezolek: 'I cannot remember.'

Mr Hankin: 'This is a little boy who had been in your life for two years and you can't remember when you last tucked him in, read him a story or bathed him, or even played with him. You didn't have his best interests at heart did you?'

Krezolek: 'I think you're right. Not because I didn't want to but because my head was occupied with something else.'

Several jurors shook their heads in apparent disbelief as Krezolek again appeared to feign distress as he was shown haunting black-and-white CT scan images of Daniel's body.

Mr Hankin asked Krezolek how he could look at the deeply distressing scans without remorse.

After Krezolek claimed he was 'truly sorry' for what had happened to his stepson, Mr Hankin told him: 'You cry for yourself Mr Krezolek and not Daniel.'
