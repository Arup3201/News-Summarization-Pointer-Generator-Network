If Sheffield United are hoping a raucous crowd will help them barge their way to Wembley on Wednesday night, then they might need to work on other plans.

Contrary to the conventional wisdom that surrounds matches between the big and small of football, noise from the stands will do nothing to upset Mauricio Pochettino – it's more likely to raise a smile.

Tottenham's manager loves an 'aggressive environment', a subject that dominated his thoughts ahead of the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg tie against Sheffield United.

With only a 1-0 lead to show for Tottenham's first-leg efforts, and considering United's brilliant cup record under Nigel Clough, this fixture is far from over. 

But of all the factors that require serious thought – including the deployment of Michel Vorm in goal after his FA Cup howler at the weekend – Pochettino is not in slightest worried about the atmosphere of his first semi-final as a manager.

'I had a lot of semi-finals as a player,' the Argentine said. 'I remember the semi final in the Copa Libertadores against America de Cali in Colombia (while playing for Newell’s Old Boys in 1992). We won the final after 24 penalties, it was tough.

'I scored after seven minutes, but afterwards missed a penalty. It was crazy. It’s difficult to play in Colombia. I remember going up the tunnel to the pitch and they started to throw batteries. I remember before the game one of my team mates (Eduardo Berizzo, now manager of Celta Vigo) got hit and cut on the head. He had to get stitches from the doctor, it was very tough.

'In Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Peru or Ecuador, people are very aggressive. It’s nothing like that here. I remember every time we drove from the airport, all the glass on the bus was smashed and we fell to the floor.

'If I can cope with that, we can cope with anything. When I came over to France, England or Spain, people told me it was difficult to play in. But when we arrived, it was nothing. They shout when something goes wrong but nothing else. This is easy.'

He added: 'My family was very worried about it, but now is happy. The people here are fantastic. Maybe it’s normal that the supporters shout at you, but in Argentina it’s impossible to have the supporters (close) in behind you because of spitting and they throw things, radios, mobiles, it’s dangerous. But in England the respect is massive.'

Pochettino described this fixture as 'most important game of the season' for Tottenham, who have not won a trophy for seven years. Despite his game-costing error against Leicester on Saturday, Vorm is set to retain his place in goal.
