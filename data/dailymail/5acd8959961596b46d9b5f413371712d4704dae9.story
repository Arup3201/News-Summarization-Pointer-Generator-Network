Watch out Corona, Coors and Cobra - Britain is fast developing a taste for Polish lager thanks to the influx of workers from Eastern Europe, new industry figures reveal.

The extra strong Tyskie brand is now so popular in the UK it has made the top ten ‘World Beers’ table alongside better known brands like Heineken and Kronenbourg.

The list records the best selling foreign beers and lagers sold in shops, supermarkets and off licences across the UK, outside the mass market brewers like Carling and Stella.

The Tyskie brand of lager is now so popular in the UK it has made the top ten 'World Beers table alongside better known brands like Heineken and Kronenbourg

But while the other brands have built up a strong following in Britain over decades, Tyskie is a relative newcomer thanks to the wave of Polish immigrants in recent years.

In Poland it accounts for one in five of all beer sales and at 5.6 per cent is stronger than most other lagers sold over here which are often too weak for Eastern European tastes.

Now it is owned by multinational brewing giant SAB Miller which also has Peroni, Grolsch and several other foreign beers.

Miller Brands sales director Tim Clay said: 'Retailers should aim to have a selection of world beers available alongside their mainstream and everyday premium lager to encourage consumers to trade up.'

Kronenbourg is the most popular world beer, followed by Beck's and San Miguel

Sales of so-called World Beers are soaring in the UK at a time when many mainstream brands are flat or showing small increases, according to trade journal Off Licence News (OLN).

Last year lager sales overall saw just a three per cent in value to £3 billion and 1.9 per cent in volume.

However world beers saw increases of 18.6 per cent in volume and 21.3 per cent in value to around £400 million, and it is continuing to increase, said analysts IRI for the study.

The economic downturn saw more people buying alcohol from shops to drink at home which led them to try brands they would not normally find prominent in pubs.

Martin Green of OLN said: 'This means they are more experimental when making food at home.

'Just as sogger kebabs and TV dinners don’t seem to cut it any more, neither do cans of standard lager.

'Shoppers are increasingly prepared to fork out on premium drinks which are still far cheaper than on-trade (pubs and bars) offerings.'

He added: 'I was surprised to see Tyskie performing so well. It must be due to the massive influx of Polish people but my non-Polish friends also like Tyskie and Zywiec so I think it’s catching on.

'It’s stronger than normal lager which I think resonates with some people.'
