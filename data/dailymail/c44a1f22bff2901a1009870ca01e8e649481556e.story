Did you wake up this morning feeling like you'd mysteriously lost of an hour of sleep?

Well, technically, you did, because today is the start of Daylight Saving for most Australian states and territories.

In the very early hours of this morning, the clock jumped forward by an hour - from 1.59am straight to 3.00am - effectively wiping an hour from your life.

Make sure your clocks are set an hour forward (if they haven't switched over automatically already)

An extra hour to spend at the beach? Sounds like a pretty good deal

Most likely you won't have noticed as your smartphones and computers should have automatically ticked over already for Daylight Saving - which will last until Sunday the 5th of April next year.

But the good news is, besides getting that lost hour back in a few months' time, that you'll get an extra hour of sunshine at the end of each day over summer.

Daylight Saving in Australia has come into effect if you live in New South Wales, Victoria, ACT, Tasmania and South Australia.

Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia do NOT follow Daylight Saving, meaning residents of those areas will keep their regular time zones.

The following time zones are now in effect, per the Australian Government website.

AEST: Queensland

AEDT: NSW (except Broken Hill), Victoria, Tamania, ACT

ACDT: South Australia and Broken Hill, NSW

ACST: NT

AWST: Western Australia 

Don't forget to set your watch and check your alarms are an hour forward - you don't want to be caught out at work this week.
