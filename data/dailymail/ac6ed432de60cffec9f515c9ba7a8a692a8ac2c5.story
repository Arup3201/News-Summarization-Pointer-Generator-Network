Ten of thousands of followers gathered today at the funeral of Sun Myung Moon, a self-proclaimed messiah who founded the Unification Church.

He was buried at a church-owned mansion modelled on the White House after a two-week mourning period.

His followers gathered at Gapyeong, an hour outside the capital Seoul, to say a final goodbye to Moon, a man who dubbed himself the 'True Parent' of those he married in mass ceremonies and who once proposed himself as 'supreme chairman" of a reunited Korea.

The church claimed that about 35,000

service at the Cheongshim Peace World Center in Gapyeong, about 60 km east of Seoul.

The ceremony was officially titled 'Sun Myung Moon, the True Parent 
of Heaven and Earth, Memorial and Ascension Ceremony.'

Men dressed in black suits with white 
ties and women in white or ivory dresses for the ceremony.

quietly as the cortege carried Moon's red-and-gold casket to the altar 
inside a vast hall in the church complex.

Some offered roses and lilies, Moon’s favourite flowers, and bowed before the portrait ringed with roses.

Church 
officials did not give details about why he was not there.

'His will is a divine will, different
from normal people,' said 69-year-old office worker Jeong Hye-ok.

'I 
believe he will establish a foundation to build a heavenly world that 
unifies peace on earth.'

'He will be in our minds 
permanently,' said Lee Ok-su, a church choir member, her face flushed 
with emotion. 'He is our benevolent yet strict father.'

The funeral, which lasted more than 
two hours, began when men wearing military honor guard-style uniforms 
carried Moon's coffin into a multipurpose gymnasium.

They slowly carried it up red-carpeted steps decked with flowers and placed it in front of a large portrait of Moon.

Many mourners wept as a top church 
official said in a speech that Moon was moving into a spiritual world 
after completing the messianic role that God had asked of him.

'God, why ... why did you call back our True Father so hurriedly?' Bo Hi Pak, chairman of the Unification Church-supported Korean Cultural Foundation, told the crowd.

'I'm so sad, and I just want to listen to his voice again,' said Jeon Myung-hu, a 43-year-old man who said he fasted for four days after hearing the news of Moon's death. 'His teachings about peace will remain forever.'

About 180,000 people visited Gapyeong during the mourning period before the funeral, according to church officials.

An estimated 7 million people paid homage at mourning sites around the world, they said.

The Unification Church claims to have 3 million followers around the world, though critics say the figure is no more than 100,000.

Moon, a staunch anti-communist who ran
a business empire as well as a church and spent 30 years living in the 
United States, was born in what is now North Korea in 1920 and escaped 
to the South in 1950 after being sentenced to hard labour.

He died aged 92 on September 3 of 
complications due to pneumonia.

The church he founded is now run by his 
youngest son, while the business entities are run by another son.

His wife remains the symbolic head of the mission that oversees the entire Tongil, Korean for 'Unification' group.

Previously thousands of mourners had gathered for the ten-day as the founder lay in a glass-covered coffin at the headquarters of his Unification Church in South Korea.

Only senior church members and specially invited mourners were allowed to view the body. But that didn’t stop the general public turning up in droves to pay their respects.

Critics for years have vilified the church as a heretical and dangerous cult and questioned its murky finances and how it indoctrinates followers, described in derogatory terms as 'Moonies.'

Moon is survived by his wife and 10 of their 13 children.

But his eldest son Hyun Jin, the chairman of UCI, which owns the UPI news agency, did not attend the funeral.

Church officials did not give details about why he was not there.
