Newcastle should appoint Steve McClaren as their new manager to replace Alan Pardew, according to former defender Darren Peacock.

McClaren is currently in charge of Derby, who sit fourth in the Championship, six points of top side Bournemouth.

But while Peacock thinks Newcastle owner Mike Ashley should be looking to bring in the former England manager, he admits Ashley may be put off by possible compensation negotiations with Derby.

Steve McClaren has done well during his time at Derby, and Darren Peacock would like him at Newcastle

Owner Mike Ashley is unlikely to want to pay too much money in compensation to secure a new manager

'McClaren for me sticks out,' Peacock told talkSport. 'He's so experienced and he's a great coach as well. I would certainly look at him.' 

'To be honest, I feel he won't go after anybody that he has to pay compensation. I think it's going to be really interesting, his next more. 

'I think it'll give an indication for his intentions for the club. Most probably he'll bring John Carver in, and if John does a good job he's most probably going to stick with him.

Alan Pardew left the club amicably on Tuesday after agreeing a deal with Crystal Palace

With club captain Fabriccio Coloccini one of the men linked to the job, Peacock is adamant that Ashley should go for a more seasoned manager.

'I think they need experience at the moment,' he added. 'They're in a decent position, they're in a comfortable position, but that can soon change. 

'Over the Christmas period and New Year, there's a lot of games. The Cup is also important to the club, so they need to stick together.'
