Killer: Brady, sketched at the tribunal yesterday taking notes, is not allowed a pen while in the secure hospital in Merseyside, after he carried it as a weapon

He committed some of the most notorious crimes of the 20th century – but Moors Murderer Ian Brady is now reduced to targeting those he dislikes by smearing jam and honey on their furniture.

The child killer regularly wipes the spreads on a chair used by a patient he bears a grudge against, and spills cereal near another's room, a mental health tribunal heard yesterday.

According to a psychiatrist treating Brady at Ashworth secure hospital, his bizarre 'surreptitious revenge' is a response to being incapable of physical violence as a frail 75-year-old.

Dr James Collins, who Brady has refused to speak to since beginning a hunger strike over a decade ago, cited the breakfast-themed campaign as evidence of his paranoid schizophrenia.

Brady also believed he could talk to Laurel and Hardy, Cilla Black and Indira Gandhi, Dr Collins added.

Brady, who won the right to have the tribunal held in public, is being force-fed, but wants to be sent back to prison in the belief he will be able to starve himself to death.

The hearing is taking place behind closed doors at the Merseyside hospital, but proceedings are being relayed to a courtroom in Manchester.

Dr Collins, Brady's medical officer for more than a decade, said the killer regularly smeared jam or honey on a chair in the ward's day room used by a patient referred to as R. He described the tactic as 'surreptitious revenge by other means', prompted by Brady's failing health.

'When he was younger, he would have it out with these guys,' he explained. 'He's now frail and elderly.

'The smearing of jam and honey on this guy's chair in the day area is clearly designed to wind him up.'

Dr Collins said there was no justification for Brady's campaign against R, which could only be explained by delusions caused by mental illness.

Brady's food-related campaign also extends to spilling cereal outside the door to a patient's room, the psychiatrist said.

'It's abnormal by any standards,' he 
said. 'No one else is going around scattering shredded oats or whatever 
they are outside people's doors in Ashworth, however ill they are.'

Patient R was also the target of an incident last year when Brady accused him of making 'pig noises'.

Dr Collins gave more details of the 
incident, describing how it culminated in Brady holding an uncapped pen 
in the face of another occupant of the ward in the style of a weapon.

Brady, a prolific letter-writer, was later banned from having a pen.

Along with Myra Hindley, who died in 
2002, Brady killed five children between 1963 and 1965 and buried them 
on Saddleworth Moor. He is expected to give evidence next week.

Yesterday at the tribunal it was revealed Brady plotted to break out of his maximum security hospital with a female visitor.

Brady gave the woman cash, clothes 
and a picture of himself as he seduced her in an effort to get out of 
Ashworth secure hospital in Merseyside.

His personal clinician told a panel of experts that it was 'clearly a preparation' for an escape, which ultimately failed.

The hearing was told the killer, 75, has also claimed to be in communication with a reincarnated Nazi and believed he could change the laws of physics.

The tribunal is being held as Brady seeks to be released from the hospital so he can die at a prison in Scotland.

Describing
the delusions which led to his being detained at Ashworth in 1985, Dr 
James Collins said Brady had also complained of being controlled by 
‘green beings’.

At one stage, he said Brady had been exchanging letters with a woman he believed to be ‘a reincarnated Nazi’.

He told a prison visitor that he could ‘change the laws of physics’ and ‘walk through locked doors at night’, he added.

Dr
Collins is Brady’s responsible medical officer at Ashworth but said the
mass murderer had refused to engage with him for more than a decade.

He
believes Brady continues to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia, 
recounting how the delusions escalated in the 1980s when he began adding
excessive amounts of salt to his food.

Brady would wait for fellow prisoners to finish their meals then take plates of custard, gravy or rice pudding to his cell.

There he would add salt ‘piled like snow’ and eat until he vomited while cursing himself and beating the walls. Asked why, Brady replied: ‘I like salt.’

Dr Collins said this was a 
‘ridiculous answer’ and in reality showed that Brady thought his food 
was being tampered with – a psychotic symptom, he added.

Although no further details of the escape plot were revealed, Dr Collins used it as an example of the killers powers of manipulation.

He
told the hearing: 'It was clearly a preparation for an escape. There is
no doubt at all about that. He opened up to this woman more than anyone
else.'

Brady also walked out of his mental health tribunal yesterday, complaining he had 'listened to this ad nauseam'.

But he was quickly slapped down by the judge who warned him 'we will hear the evidence.'

The child killer even suggested a panel member had fallen asleep at one point during the hearing.

The
75-year-old complained that he had heard all the evidence before as a 
criminal psychologist was questioned over several hours about his mental
health.

At the end of Dr 
Adrian Grounds's evidence, Judge Robert Atherton, chair of the three-man
tribunal panel, asked if Brady wanted to say something.

Brady, wearing dark sunglasses, a 
dark jacket, white shirt and tie, spoke in a low, gravelly Scottish 
accent. Many of his words were inaudible.

Referring to Dr Cameron Boyd, who sits on the tribunal panel, Brady said: 'It even apparently lulls him to sleep.'

In other evidence yesterday, the 
tribunal was told that Brady is nocturnal and only leaves his room at 
night. He shuns others, partly because of his superiority complex.

But he also fears other patients and 
habitually carried a pen between his knuckles as an improvised weapon, 
until it was taken away.

As well as his 'nocturnal' existence,
Brady was described as contemptuous of his peers. He shows anger that 
can erupt over minor matters and unleashes verbal tirades against staff 
and other patients, the tribunal heard.

He also targets individuals, both 
staff and patients, attempts to manipulate others, bypasses security and
bends the rules to suit himself, the panel was told.

He will only deal with people 'high 
up' in the hospital hierarchy - consistent with his narcissistic 
personality disorder, the tribunal heard.

Brady, who has been on hunger strike since 1999, claims he has faked psychotic episodes by 'acting' in the past.

The hearing was told of hospital records from January 29 this year stating how Brady has now 'almost totally isolated himself'.

Following a seizure last July, 
hospital notes recorded him saying: 'If I have to, I will never let them
see me in pain. I will act as if I have not a care in the world.'

Brady is currently 'nursed' in the hospital setting because he is regarded as being severely mentally ill.

Brady and partner Myra Hindley murdered five youngsters in the 1960s, burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester.

Both were jailed for life at Chester Assizes in 1966. Hindley died in jail in November 2002 at the age of 60.

The hearing is being held in a room inside Ashworth and relayed by video to Manchester Civil Justice Centre.
