Just for a second, Tony Mowbray allowed himself to drift off into a brighter future before crashing back to the remorseless reality of Coventry City’s present.

‘I look to the summer time and how we are going to build a team that is a Coventry City team,’ the new manager began.

‘But that’s for another day. The immediate concern is just to win some matches.’

For Mowbray, who arrived at the club last week, Coventry City is a club of heritage and romance. It is Keith Houchen’s diving header crashing into the Wembley net in 1987, it is Jimmy Hill leading the ‘Sky Blue Revolution’, it is of a team that was a staple of the top division for 34 years. 

He has vowed to take them back there, to their ‘rightful place’.

The reality is very different. Today, Hill’s bronze statue stands outside a superstore for the rugby club Wasps, whose amber and black logo looms over the main entrance.

They own the place; Coventry City are strangers in their own home, seeking to get out in the next few years.

The Ricoh Arena is magnificent, ready for the top flight. But few thought that would mean Premiership rugby union rather than Premier League football.

Confidence has drained, crowds are down. When the club returned from their exile in Northampton 35 miles away back in September, over 27,000 packed into the ground.

On Saturday, a mere 9,446 turned out. The potential for massive crowds is obvious but poor form has seen many return their scarves to the back of the wardrobe.

It’s because Coventry are staring at the indignity of fourth-tier football for the first time since 1959 and, after this chastening reintroduction to management after 16 months away, Mowbray is in no doubt as to how precarious their situation is.

‘If we’d sat here and we’d won, I’d be telling you how great it was but as a football manager it really hurts,’ he reflected. ‘The highs are really good, the lows low but there’s not much in between.

‘It would have been nice to give the fans a victory. I don’t think the players let them down but we are where we are.’

To be exact, still a sole point above the relegation zone after an afternoon that had started so positively for his team. 

The mere presence of the former Hibernian, West Brom, Celtic and Middlesbrough boss seemed to energise the place initially and Coventry led on four minutes through captain Jim O’Brien.

They were comfortable until two Port Vale goals just before the break turned the tables. Tom Pope and then the impressive Mark Marshall, released by Mowbray’s predecessor Steven Pressley in the summer, exposed defensive flaws.

But Coventry rallied and when Sanmi Odelusi came off the bench to level, they had all the momentum with 20 minutes to play. Alas, six minutes later, Michael O’Connor’s free-kick handed the three points to Vale, who are just two points off the play-offs.

Their manager, Rob Page, made 70 league appearances for Coventry as a defender. He certainly doesn’t want to see them slide into League Two.

‘I think they have just brought in a fantastic manager,’ he said. ‘I think he will keep them up and then build in the summer for next season.’

For Mowbray, though, it’s only the here and now that matters.

PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND

Derby County were about to go top of the Championship as goals from Jamie Ward and Tom Ince put them 2-0 up against Birmingham. But Gary Rowett’s men staged a stunning stoppage-time comeback through a Paul Caddis penalty and Clayton Donaldson’s leveller.

WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE 

Daryl Murphy extended his Championship tally to 22 goals but the striker was left to rue missing a sitter from four yards as Ipswich were held 1-1 by Brentford.

Aston Villa loanee Gary Gardner scored a cracker as Nottingham Forest’s resurgence under Dougie Freedman continued with a 2-1 win over title-chasing Middlesbrough.

Simon Grayson’s Preston North End have hit form at the perfect time. Their 2-0 win at MK Dons was their sixth win in seven in the league, all coming with clean sheets.
