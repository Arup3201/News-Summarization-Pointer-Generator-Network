Julie Lindley and her prize winning bull mastiff Theo, one of the dogs that attacked the three little girls.

A top breeder whose show dogs savaged three young girls was given a suspended jail sentence today.

The girls, aged five to seven, were attacked by two bull mastiffs as they walked home from school with their mothers.

They were ‘shaken like dolls’ and bitten all over their bodies, a court heard. All needed hospital treatment for their wounds and two required surgery.

Owner Julie Lindley, 53, admitted the dogs, which had escaped from her garden, were dangerously out of control. She destroyed both dogs after the attack, Manchester Minshull Street Court heard.

One, a two-year-old called Theo, had just been named a top UK bull mastiff and had come third at Crufts.

Theo attacked the girls in Bolton after escaping from his pen with another dog on March 22 last year.

Caroline Hamer told the court how the dogs bounded towards them as she walked home with her daughter, Nicola, seven, and her five-year-old friends Matilda Dawning and Charlotte Riggs.

Alison Hayworth, prosecuting said: ‘The dogs pushed them all to the ground and Mrs Hamer quickly got up, however Nicola was still on the pavement with both dogs attacking her, biting her and shaking her like a doll.

‘Mrs Hamer got the dog off and tried to wedge herself between it and her daughter. A passer-by put the girl, who was covered in blood, in a car.’

The dogs then lunged at Matilda. Her 
mother tried to lift her out of the way but one bit the girl’s leg and 
it became ‘a tug of war’ as both mother and child were pulled into the 
road.

Lucy Riggs, the mother of Charlotte, watched in horror as the dogs grabbed her daughter’s arm and pierced her forearm. Motorist Darren Westhead desperately tried to stop the attack by driving into one dog. But it got up again and began snapping once more.

When police found the dogs, Theo had blood in his mouth.

The three mothers told the court their daughters had been ‘terrified’ and would bear the physical and psychological scars for years, if not for life.

Lindley, from Bolton, who runs breeding company Hyerdunscar Bullmastiffs, admitted being the owner of two dogs dangerously out of control.

Since the incident, two cages have been put into the garden and the fence has been strengthened, the court heard.

Judge Martin Allweis said he accepted that Lindley was full of remorse but the attack had been ‘serious and sustained’ against three children.

He sentenced her to three months in jail, suspended for 12 months, and ordered her to pay £1,000 costs. She now faces a civil claim for compensation.
