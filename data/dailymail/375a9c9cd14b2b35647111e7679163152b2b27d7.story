Drunk: Henrietta Fearon, seen outside Hammersmith Magistrates' Court, downed Pimm's and wine

A middle-class mother drove home from a pub with her four year-old son in the car while nearly three times over the drink-drive limit.

Henrietta Fearon, 34, downed Pimm’s and wine during an afternoon birthday party at The Rose in Fulham, south-west London.

A witness dialled 999 after spotting the drunk woman getting into her black Mini outside. She later staggered to the front door and ‘rambled’ to police when officers arrived to arrest her.

Personal assistant Fearon, who works for a chartered surveyor, drove the 1.5 miles home to her £585,000 home without incident, but immediately confessed when confronted.

She pleaded guilty at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday to driving with excess alcohol on July 20.

Fearon was fined £625 and disqualified for two years and four months. Her breathalyser reading was 95mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35ml per 100ml.

Tom Gill, prosecuting, said: ‘Police received a call from a concerned member of the public concerning a woman who had left the Rose public house (and) drove off with a child.

‘Police visited the defendant’s address and she answered the door while unsteady on her feet and rambled on about being at a friend’s birthday party that afternoon, where she had Pimm’s and wine. She said: “I can’t believe this. I’ve made a big mistake”.’

Naomi Alcendor, defending, said: ‘She took her son to a play centre and went to the party and did not consume any alcohol. She collected her son, but then stopped off again at the party on the way home.

‘It is a family-orientated venue with a garden and she did consume alcohol and decided to drive the short distance to her home. She is devastated to find herself in this position because she had her son with her that day.’

Magistrate Nicola Leach told Fearon: ‘This is a very, very high reading and we are concerned you drove under such circumstances with your son in the car.’

Fearon also had to pay £85 costs and a £65 victim surcharge, which she agreed to pay immediately.
