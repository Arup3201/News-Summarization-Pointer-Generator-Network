Thousands of travellers saw their holiday plans thrown into jeopardy after power failures struck at Stansted and Gatwick airports.

Passengers reported queues stretching the length of the main terminal building for departures at Stansted, where flights were still taking off despite the disruption. 

Meanwhile a signalling problem at Gatwick meant that no trains could run into or out of the airport's train station for at least 45 minutes - just three days before Christmas.

Frustrated passengers found themselves stuck on trains, with many complaining that they were not told whether or not they were likely to arrive at the airport in time for their flights.

Cancelled: Many train services were scrapped or delayed in the aftermath of the signalling failure

At Stansted, one passenger tweeted that the mood was turning ugly, with police having to hold back the crowds.

The power failure, which started in mid-afternoon, affected a satellite building and the track transit which takes passengers  for boarding.

Stansted said neither the main terminal nor the runway were affected and passengers were being taken by bus to their flights. 

Signalling problems at Gatwick apparently continued all day, because even after the issue was fixed there were tailbacks which lasted several hours and had a knock-on effect on services.

This is the second Christmas in a row that Gatwick has faced severe delays - last year, a power outage caused by flooding led to days of chaos at the airport.

After today's signal failure, just one Gatwick Express train was running from London Victoria to Gatwick every 45 minutes, compared to every 15 minutes under normal conditions. 

Southern Trains said a signal problem occurred at 11.45am. Normal service resumed only after 6.15pm last night. 

The problem had affected services run by the Southern, Gatwick Express, First Great Western and Thameslink train companies.

Waiting: Passengers at Victoria station in London faced an anxious wait to see if they would catch the train

Warning: Passengers were told to assume delays of up to 70 minutes on their way to the airport

Passengers were warned to expect delays of up to 70 minutes, which many travellers said would cause them to miss their flights.

On Twitter, Iona Spackman posted: ‘It’s the Christmas period you can’t not know how to sort the signal failure or tell your customers how long the delay will last Gatwick!!!!!!’

Others pleaded with airlines to hold up their flights. One Twitter user wrote: ‘@emirates all trains into Gatwick have been stopped, loads of passengers on your flight. Can you delay the flight? #help’.

Maria May tweeted: 'Argh stupid Victoria station and Gatwick express - all delayed meaning I missed my flight. 4 hours to kill now at Gatwick.'

Chris Grist added: '@GatwickExpress we've been stuck over 40 mins how much longer people are going to miss their flights soon.'

And Jodi Gramigni wrote: '@GatwickExpress @GatwickAirport Pls advise on the delay. We have been on the train 1 hour & no info on arrival time. #ChristmasFail.'

Scene: Following the delays, parts of Gatwick Airport looked almost totally deserted

Empty: Many customers complained that they were unable to get to the airport in time for their flights

Stansted Airport was also hit by technical problems, as the power failed in a satellite terminal and the track transit which takes passengers there.

Authorities said neither the main terminal nor the runway were affected and that passengers were being taken by bus to their flights. 

At Leeds Bradford airport, 60mph winds meant planes had to abort landing attempts and fly to Manchester instead.

Flights from Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, and Amsterdam were cancelled.

At Dover, ferry passengers were held up by a train that broke down between Sandling and Folkestone West. Buses replaced trains from Ashford International to Dover Priory. Meanwhile, no trains ran between Clapham Junction in London and Milton Keynes due to staff shortages.

In Guiseley, Yorkshire, services were cancelled after trees fell on overhead wires, while in Scotland floods stopped trains from Kilmarnock to Dumfries.

And drivers sat in traffic for at least three hours on the M6 southbound, with junctions 16 to 17 near Stoke closed after an accident.
