Nelson Mandela, said to be on the brink of death earlier this month, has made a dramatic improvement, his daughter revealed yesterday.

Zindzi Mandela said her father, whose 95th birthday is today, has been watching television in his bed in hospital and that he smiles at family members and raises his hand.

‘I should think he will be going home any time soon,’ said Zindzi, whose mother is Mandela’s second wife, Winnie.

People have been urged to volunteer for charity to mark Nelson Mandela's birthday tomorrow as he continues to be treated in hospital for a recurrent lung infection

Just a fortnight ago, the former South African president was said to be in a persistent vegetative state and near death.

He has been in a Pretoria hospital since June 8 and officials say his condition is critical but stable.

It was anticipated that the 
anti-apartheid hero may be discharged to mark his birthday but he is 
still in hospital with a recurring lung infection.

The
Nelson Mandela Center of Memory and other groups have called on people 
to volunteer 67 minutes to charity in honour of the 67 years that 
Mandela served his community.

The United Nations has also recognised the Mandela's struggle against apartheid and say his birthday is an opportunity to honour his legacy, and activities are planned around the globe.

The UN said the donation of time is fitting as Mandela worked for 67 years as a human rights lawyer, a prisoner of conscience, a peacemaker and then South Africa's first black president.

Mandela's birthday, July 18, was declared Nelson Mandela International Day by the UN General Assembly in 2009 as a recognition of his contribution to the culture of peace and freedom.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s said this year Mandela's birthday comes at a time of 'deep reflection on the life and work of Madiba, as the universally revered leader remains in the hospital'.

Since the anti-apartheid hero was hospitalised last month, South Africans have held vigils, sang and prayed for the former president outside his hospital in Pretoria

He added: 'Nelson Mandela gave 67 years of his life to the struggle for human rights and social justice.

'The heart of Nelson Mandela International Day is good works for people and the planet.

'This is the best tribute we can pay to an extraordinary man who embodies the highest values of humanity.'

South Africa President Jacob Zuma will mark Mandela's birthday by overseeing the donation of houses to poor families in the Pretoria area.

Mandela was admitted to a Pretoria hospital on June 8 for a recurring lung infection.

Earlier this week, former president Thabo Mbeki predicted Mandela could be discharged from hospital soon to recuperate at home.

Friends who have visited him say he is on life support in the form of mechanical ventilation.

The most recent official update on his health said Mandela was in critical but stable condition.

But both Mandela's wife, Graca Machel, and President Jacob Zuma have said recently that Mandela is responding to treatment.

The anti-apartheid hero spent 27 years in prison before becoming South Africa's first black president in 1994.
