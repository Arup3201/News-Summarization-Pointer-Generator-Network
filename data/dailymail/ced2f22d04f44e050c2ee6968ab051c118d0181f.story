The Queen has visited Prince Philip in hospital where he is said to be recovering well from the infection which forced him to miss the final two days of her spectacular Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

She arrived at the King Edward VII Hospital in central London at 5.10pm, hours after Buckingham Palace said his condition had 'improved considerably' and that he was in 'good spirits'.

The Duke of York also went to visit his father, arriving half an hour after the Queen, who stayed a little over 45 minutes.

Despite his progress, the  Duke of Edinburgh is still expected to spend the next few days in hospital, where he has been since Monday, until he makes a full recovery.

It is not known whether he will be out in time to celebrate his 91st birthday on Sunday.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The treatment of 
his infection continues with antibiotics. He is likely to remain in 
hospital over the next few days. He is in good spirits.'

The illness forced the Duke to miss several key events of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, including a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral and the concert outside Buckingham Palace.

The Earl and Countess of Wessex visited the Duke with their children Louise and James yesterday.

After
 their 25-minute visit, Edward said his father was feeling 'much better' and appeared to be  making a 
good recovery

He added that the Duke had
 watched the thanksgiving service at St Paul’s on television. ‘He’s feeling a lot better, he just needs some rest,’ he 
added.

He said the Queen was ‘bearing up’ 
but added: ‘She’s missing him, obviously.’ Edward’s wife, Sophie, said 
the Duke was ‘naturally upset’ to miss the celebrations but added: ‘He’s
 on good form. He is in good spirits.’

Although
 bladder infections are quite common in men of Prince Philip’s age, 
doctors are monitoring him closely, not least because he had heart 
surgery less than six months ago.

The Queen has continued with her public 
Jubilee duties stoically despite her husband's ill health but is being 
regularly updated on his condition.

Asked how his mother was coping, 
Edward replied: 'She is bearing up but missing him, obviously. Thank you
 very much for your concern. It is much appreciated.'

Prime Minister David Cameron said that everyone is concerned about the health of the Duke after he was 
taken to hospital with an infection.

Mr
 Cameron said he was sure the Queen and the Duke would have gone ahead 
with Sunday’s river pageant in torrential rain regardless of the risks 
to their health after the day’s exertions - spending four hours on the 
water - were blamed for his turn of ill-health.

Speaking
 to Sky News, Mr Cameron said: 'It was a most extraordinary spectacle 
and obviously everyone is very concerned and worried and wants to know 
that (the Duke) is going to be OK.

IN older people a muddled mind can be one of the first signs of a bladder infection and can occur remarkably quickly.

The onset of such symptoms can be alarming for family members, especially if the person affected is normally fit and well. The changes can be mistaken for early signs of dementia, or even a stroke.

If it is left untreated it can lead to hallucinations or agitation. Most doctors will, however, recognise the signs and order a urine test.

They can then use a working diagnosis of a urinary tract infection until the test results arrive.

Antibiotics are standard treatment and effective, especially when given intravenously – bringing the patient back to normality within a few days.

Harley Street doctor Malcolm Vandeburg said the duke’s condition could be a sign of other issues with his health.

He said: ‘In a man of around 90, the thing that you would think of is some form of bladder outlet obstruction which would, at the top of the list, be some form of obstruction around the prostate.’

But he also stressed that if treated early, the condition was very controllable.

'The thing about our Royal Family is 
that they are incredibly dedicated to what they do and they are 
incredibly dedicated to doing it, no matter what the circumstances.

'I don’t know all the conversations 
that took place but I would be pretty certain that Her Majesty and the 
Duke of Edinburgh would have wanted to do what they did and would have 
carried on doing it.'

On Monday night the Queen was visibly 
moved as Prince Charles joked that the Duke of Edinburgh might hear the 
Jubilee concert from his bed if the crowd shouted loud enough.

In a warm, emotional and often witty 
speech in praise of his mother at the close of the Diamond Jubilee Concert, 
that appeared to make her lip quiver more than once, the
 Prince of Wales said it was sad that the Duke of Edinburgh could not be
 at the event after being taken unwell

While the Duke’s condition is not 
believed to be serious, doctors will not be taking any chances, given 
his advancing years, because bladder infections in the elderly can get 
worse very quickly if not treated promptly.

Questions are likely to be asked 
whether it was wise to allow the Duke, who had a stent inserted in his 
heart less than six months ago, to take part in Sunday’s Diamond Jubilee
 Pageant, standing in the rain for four hours.

It is understood that staff at 
ambulance control in Berkshire received a call from Windsor Castle 
shortly after 2pm reporting that Prince Philip was feeling unwell.

The medical crew used a chair to help him into the ambulance.

Despite his advancing years the 
Queen’s husband has largely enjoyed good health and most of his past 
ailments have been sports-related. Before undergoing heart surgery at 
Christmas his most recent previous illness was a cold in October last 
year which forced him to pull out of an overnight stay in Italy.

One of his most serious bouts of ill 
health came in 2008 when he was admitted to hospital in London with a 
chronic chest infection.

The Duke’s absence from the rest of the Diamond Jubilee events will come as a terrible blow to his wife of 64 years.

Although she is, ostensibly, the ‘senior partner’ in their relationship, she relies on her husband ‘utterly’.

‘It may be a cliché but he truly is the power behind the throne,’ said a source.
