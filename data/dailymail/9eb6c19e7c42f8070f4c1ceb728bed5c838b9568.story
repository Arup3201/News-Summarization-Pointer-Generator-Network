The video, uploaded with background hip-hop music, shows two identifiable men with their fists up and getting ready for the fight.

Then the pair proceed to forcibly punch each other - aiming for anywhere on the body - while one of them is cornered and bashed repeatedly in the stomach.

It is clear from the footage that two other men are in the cell and watching the fight which lasts under 30 seconds.

The ABC reported that the aggressive struggle took place in ACT's Alexander Maconochie Centre.

Shane Rattenbury, the ACT Corrections Minister,  said he was concerned by the video.

He said he is seeking a full report from his department to try to identify the men involved, whether they are current detainees and further confirm where the video was filmed.

'Once we have that sort info we'll then proceed into the next stage of the investigation,' he said.

The original video has been taken down.
