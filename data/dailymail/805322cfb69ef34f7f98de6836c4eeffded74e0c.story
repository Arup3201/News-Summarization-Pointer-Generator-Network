A life-saving genetic test for prostate cancer could be developed after British scientists found the 100th gene for the disease.

The researchers believe they may be able to tell whether a man’s DNA puts him at higher than average risk of the cancer, which kills almost 11,000 Britons a year.

A simple, cheap NHS saliva test could be ready in five years for men of at least 55.

Almost 42,000 cases are diagnosed in the UK each year, making it the most common male cancer. But there is no accurate test.

Scientists from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, Cambridge University and the U.S. examined the DNA of 90,000 men.

Half had the cancer and comparing their DNA with that of healthy men revealed genes that raised the risk of the disease.

Some 77 
genes were already known, but the research took the total to 100, the 
journal Nature Genetics reported – enough for a genetic test to be 
created.

It is hoped the test will also be able to distinguish how dangerous a man’s cancer is.

The Great North Run was held through the streets of Tyneside to raise money for Prostate Cancer UK

Prostate cancer may grow so slowly that it never causes men any problems and they die of something else. But a fast-growing, dangerous form needs urgent attention.

Difficulty in telling them apart can mean men with the less severe form receive painful, unnecessary treatment.

Last Sunday, the Great North Run was held through the streets of Tyneside to raise money for Prostate Cancer UK.
