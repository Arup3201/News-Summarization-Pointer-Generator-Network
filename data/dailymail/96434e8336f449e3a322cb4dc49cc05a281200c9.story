In a moving tribute to her 'beautiful dad' one of fugitive Rodney Clavell's daughters has posted a haunting message on Facebook saying, 'you must have felt so alone at the end, I can't imagine'.

The daughter, one of Rodney Clavell's ten surviving children, posted the message on the day her father was found dead after a 12-hour siege in the Adelaide CBD.

In two posts on her Facebook page following her father's death, the Adelaide girl said, 'I hope you are peaceful now and never have to run again'.

In the first message, she said, I love you daddy! No one will understand the hard life you have had and the decisions you have made.

'I love you and forgive you for everything. You will be close to my heart til the day I see you again. R.I.P Rodney Clavell'.

In a later post on the same day, she wrote, 'You were taken too soon!

I never got to say goodbye or tell you how much I loved you.

'I don't care what anyone says you were a good dad when we were little, you taught us so much I know deep down you just wanted the best for us!

'You must have felt so alone in the end I can't even imagine. I hope you are peaceful now and never have to run again.

'You were a beautiful man and will be greatly missed by us. Without you I already have a piece of me missing that belongs to you forever!'

Emmanuel Clavell, also known as Manny, tried to save his uncle Rodney Clavell's life during a 12-hour-siege on Thursday which ended with 'a shot'

He was the uncle who mentored him in prison and to whom he looked up to and in Rodney Clavell's final hour, nephew Emmanuel Clavell tried to save his life.

But when Emmanuel Clavell, 39, made a last minute dash to the siege where his uncle was holed up on Thursday surrounded by police in a shutdown of the Adelaide CBD, he was a fraction too late.

'Manny managed to push through two barricades to get to police and beg to speak to Rodney,' Emmanuel Clavell's uncle, Gary Clavell, told Mailonline.

'He wanted to talk him out. He had just got through the barriers to try and ask whether he could negotiate, when one of the officers said, "We've heard a shot".

'I don't know whether the police wouldn't let Emmanuel through early enough or whether he was just too late, but it was all over for Rodney.

'Emmanuel was close to Rodney after he'd got into a bit of trouble and Uncle Rodney looked after him in prison, made sure he was okay. Yeah, protected him.'

Emmanuel spent a year in prison, including several months at the Adelaide Remand Centre where Rodney Clavell was serving time as an influential 'top dog' inmate.

'He couldn't get through and he's very upset, very cut up,' Emmanuel's father, Wayne Clavell said.

Mailonline can reveal the untold background of fugitive Rodney Clavell, his close family bonds and the secrets and lies of his complicated relationships with his father and brothers, and the strong bond he formed with his nephew.

Gary Clavell, a 63-year-old Adelaide gyprocker who is a half- brother to Rodney Clavell, 46, said the key to why the fugitive went on the run and shot himself dead in the siege said lay in his relationship with his father, Alby, and the mysterious death of a brother, Ricky.

Rodney Clavell took his own life following a 12-hour siege in Adelaide on Thursday

'I'll never forget the day he pulled me aside and begged me to take him away from the family,' Gary Clavell said.

'He was about 13 at the time. Rodney was a lovely kid, but he was very sensitive.

'I'd lay his problems back to then, our father, and his [full] brother Ricky who was a thief and a drug dealer.'

Rodney's late father, Edward Alfred 'Alby' Clavell was a violent alcoholic who fathered two families - Gary and his brother Wayne and two siblings, before moving on to formed a relationship with Beverley Cox, fathering her sons and daughters, Ricky, Rodney, Raylene and Roslyn.

'Dad was bastard. It was long-handled shovels over the back and a piece of four by two on your legs,' Mr Clavell said.

'Rodney might have had it easier after Alby gave up alcohol, but he was still a cold man. It was a straight 'shut the f*** up' and Rodney was a timid, nice little boy.

'He was also living in a home where his grandmother was very nasty on the drink, so one day he got me outside and asked me if I could take him away. He wanted to come and live with me to escape all the nastiness.'

Mr Clavell said when Rodney was in his late teens, Alby taught him how to weld and Rodney worked as a welder at the South Australian submarine base, at Osbourne, in north-western Adelaide and was so skilled he taught at a local TAFE college, thereafter becoming a prison officer in the early 2000s.

'Then he became religious which doesn't come from our side of the family. He got religious to the point that he banned our father from his home for the last two years of Dad's life because the old man just couldn't not swear.

Emmanuel Clavell was the nephew of Rodney, and the pair had a close relationship while serving time behind bars together

It was revealed that Rodney, here with one of his daughters, had a tough relationship with his own father, according to step-brother Gary

'Dad died 14 years ago. It was after that Rodney started having problems.

'Dad had taught him boxing and he was a very good amateur boxer. But then through [his brother] Ricky he got into drugs and he started working as a debt collector.

'He was an enforcer. He pulverised anyone who didn't want to pay the money they owed.'

Gary Clavell described Rodney's older brother, who died around six years ago, as 'a mongrel' who had robbed a post office in Adelaide's northern suburbs in 1984.

'Ricky was like Alby and the opposite of Rodney,' he said. He got into drugs and he stole off his family. He knocked off the Elizabeth post office.

'Then he got stabbed in jail. After he got out he got Rodney involved in the drugs and they were selling them together.

'Then Ricky got murdered. It was the weirdest thing and I think it really affected Rodney.'

Mr Clavell said Ricky was 'asked by a friend' to help clean up a rented property to reclaim the bond.

The friend told Ricky he could have sandwiches and a bottle of coca cola in the refrigerator on the premises. When Ricky fell ill, he was taken to hospital, but died of poisoning three days later. The 'friend' was never charged.

Gary Clavell opened up about Rodney's dark past with his family and history with drugs and crime

'It affected Rodney. Ricky was the bad brother with the slightly tuned eye from an accident that gave him a mental look.

'Rodney was the good brother and the good looking one, even from his early teens who had no trouble attracting lots of female.

'I don't know what he felt after [Ricky's death], but he was the one in the family the others looked up to.'

A prostitute who knew Rodney Clavell told Mailonline she couldn't imagine him carrying out the brutal hostage drama described by police.

Fugitive Rodney Clavell was found dead inside the brothel where he had been hiding out in Adelaide's CBD on Thursday, his body discovered following a 12-hour siege.

'He was a criminal, but I don't think he would have hurt those girls,' said Mindy, 30, who works at a brothel in Adelaide's CBD not far from Marilyn's Studio.

Rodney had a complex past with his own family, and the loss of his brother Ricky had a big effect on him

'He knew one of the girls and I'm pretty sure he was friends with the manager [name witheld].'

A prison officer who worked with Clavell at the Adelaide Remand Centre in the early 2000s described him as a good officer whose downfall came when he started using steroids.

'He was a well spoken bloke, very respectful, a nice fellow,' said the currently serving officer who asked not to be identified.

'He did his job well, then he had a downward spiral and went out of control,  started using steroids.

'It's a tragedy.'

A former South Australian prison official said Clavell had relatives who were in the prison system in  the 1970s as inmates.

'They were well known petty crims,' he said.
