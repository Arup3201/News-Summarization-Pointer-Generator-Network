These pictures show the HMS Bounty moments before it sinks as rescue teams recover the body of one crew member from the sea while the ship's captain remains missing, presumed dead.

Claudene Christian, 42, was pulled from the sea last night but was unresponsive and later pronounced dead, the U.S. coastguard said.

It now means 15 of the 16 crew members of the iconic boat are accounted for - with 63-year-old captain Robin Walbridge yet to be found.

These dramatic pictures show the 
moment stranded crew members of the iconic HMS Bounty were rescued from 
their life boats by the U.S. coastguard.

The crew of the vessel
 were forced to abandon ship off the east coast of America yesterday as it 
became caught in raging seas near the eye of Hurricane Sandy.

Two coast guard helicopters rescued 14 people from life rafts after they were forced to abandon ship.

Ms Christian's mother, who is also called Claudene, said the ship began taking on water after a generator went out on the ship on Sunday night.

It was around 160 miles from the eye of the storm as it made its way from Connecticut to Florida.

Her mother said she was contacted by her daughter on Thursday when she said she wouldn't be able to contact them from the sea, according to 5newsonline.

Ms Christian was a former Miss Teen Alaska and attended the University of Southern Carolina.

Her aunt, Patricia Saulsberry, said that she had been interested in ships since she toured replicas of Nina and Pinta.

As six-metre waves and ferocious gales battered the decks of the 180-foot,
 three-masted ship - knocking out its power - terrified crew-members 
clambered into life boats to watch their floating home shrink unmanned 
into the darkness.

These pictures show U.S. coastguard 
teams rescuing the crewmen from their lifeboats. One of the terrified 
crewmen can be seen being dragged from the lifeboat and into the sea by a
 brave rescuer.

The world-famous boat - which 
featured in Hollywood blockbusters Mutiny on the Bounty with Marlon 
Brando and two Pirates of the Caribbean films, starring Johnny Depp - 
became stranded on Sunday night about 90 miles southeast of Hatteras, North Carolina.

Heroic: Three helicopters were used by the coastguard team to rescue the 14 crew men

The crew were picked hours later up by a search and rescue team who were dispatched by helicopter to bring them to safety.

But fears were confirmed that this was indeed the final voyage of the historic replica after the coast guard 
said it did not have time to retrieve her before conditions became too 
dangerous.

'The 17 person crew donned cold water
 survival suits and lifejackets before launching in two 25-man lifeboats
 with canopies,' the Coast Guard said in a statement.

The ship was built in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia for the 1962 movie Mutiny on the Bounty that starred Marlon Brando.

It is a replica of the British Navy's original HMS Bounty on which the famous mutiny took place in Tahiti in 
1789 and is now used as a sailing school for prospective seafarers.

It was built using the original ship drawings from files in the 
British admiralty archives, but its dimensions were enlarged by around a third to fit the enormous 70 mm cameras used in the filming.

Some 400,000 feet of lumber were used, 10,000 square yards of canvas were 
sewn by hand and 10 miles of rope were rigged before it was ready for the silver screen.

Fears: The coast guard had to let the historic replica sink to the bottom of the ocean because conditions became too dangerous for a rescue

The plan was to burn the ship in a dramatic final act, but Marlon Brando had become so attached to the vessel that he threatened to walk out in protest so, rather than lose their star, its owners MGM agreed to keep it in service.

It has since become one of Hollywood's most famous ships and was used in filming for the 1989 film Treasure Island with Charlton Heston and also appeared in two of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, both starring Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley.

This year it was put up for sale by its current owners for $4.6 million.

'Bounty': It is an exact replica of the British Navy's original HMS Bounty on which the famous mutiny took place in Tahiti in 1789

The mutiny that took place aboard the original Bounty is one of the most famous of all seafaring tales.

It was led by Fletcher Christian, played in the 1962 film by Marlon Brando, against commanding officer Lieutenant William Bligh, played by Trevor Howard, on  28 April 1789.

According to most reports, the crew had become fed up with the rod of iron with which Lt. Bligh commanded the ship and decided overthrow him to start new lives on the Pacific Islands.

They rounded up Lt Bligh and a handful of his loyal seamen and set them afloat in a dinghy leaving them to their fate.

The men then settled in on Pitcairn Island and in Tahiti before burning HMS Bounty to avoid detection where many of their descendants remain to this day.
