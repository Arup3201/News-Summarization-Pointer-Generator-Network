Beverley Concannon will appear in court in October to face charges under the Animal Cruelty Act 2006

The owner of four dogs that mauled a teenage girl to death has been charged with animal cruelty offences, it has emerged.

Jade Lomas-Anderson, 14, died after she was attacked by the aggressive animals earlier this year.

The dogs' owner, Beverley Concannon, from Worsley Hall, Wigan, has been charged with three offences under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.

She will appear at Wigan Magistrates’ Court on October 1, Greater Manchester Police said.

Jade's parents were outraged after the 45-year-old reportedly failed to apologise for her dogs' actions at the time of the incident.

The charge comes after Jade's family launched an online campaign calling for a change in the law to make dog owners more responsible for their pets' actions. 

Justice for Jade seeks to amend the law so that police are able to prosecute owners of dogs that behave viciously.

Over 10,000 people have signed the online petition, prompting the Government to extend the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 to include private property.

The Department of Environment, Food, Rural Affairs said: 'The Government takes a deed and breed approach in dealing with attacks by dogs and sees early intervention as a crucial way to prevent future attacks'.

Jade was alone at a friend's house 
in Chaucer Grove near Wigan when she was 
attacked by two bull mastiffs and two Staffordshire bull 
terriers on March 26.  

Witnesses said she was attacked by the dogs after entering a room holding a meat pie.

While one of the animals tried to snatch the food, the others dragged her body to the ground and mauled her to death.

Police marksmen shot the dogs on arrival at the scene.

At the time, Greater Manchester Police revealed there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution.

A spokesman said: 'At this stage 
of the inquiry, we do not have anything evidentially to categorically 
prove a crime has been committed, therefore it is unlikely at this stage
we will be seeking to bring a prosecution,' but added: 'That is not to say that no prosecution will ever be brought'.

Jade's parents said they wouldn't have let their daughter go to the property if they'd known the dogs were there.

Mr Lomas-Anderson told The Sun in April: 'I feel so guilty about that - it's eating me up inside.

Concannon is thought to have been in 
hiding ever since the attack and her house has been sealed off by the 
council following requests by the police.

Mike Lomas-Anderson,33,  said he hoped the petition will lead to a change in the law to protect other families.

If it reaches 100,000 signatures a debate will take place in the House of Commons.
