NBC Sports Network has decided to cancel a hunting show after the host, a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, likened his critics to Adolf Hitler.

The network sparked outrage after airing an episode of Tony Makris's show, 'Under Wild Skies,' in which Makris kills an African elephant by shooting it in the face and then celebrates the hunt by drinking champagne. 

In response to his critics, Makris went on an NRA-sponsored radio show and accused them of 'animal racism' for jumping to the defense of elephants as opposed to other animals.

'And [critics] said but they're so 
big and special and they're smarter. And I went, you know, Hitler would 
have said the same thing,' he said.

NBC Sports has canceled 'Under Wild Skies' as a result of his remarks.

'"Under
 Wild Skies" will no longer air on NBC Sports Sports Network due to the 
program’s close association with its host, whose recent comments 
comparing his critics to Hitler are outrageous and unacceptable,' the 
network told Deadspin in a statement. 'NBCSN will continue to air all of our other quality outdoor programming.'

The episode where Makris kills an elephant is filmed in Botswana, where elephant hunting remains legal until 2014, when a new law against hunting the endangered animals kicks into effect. 

In a highlighted reel from the show, Makris
 and the guide are shown hiding behind brush about 20 feet away from the animal. They 
talk about shooting it in the face before Makris fires a couple shots.

'I'm bent over literally shootin' through a hole in the trees,' he says to the guide, just before firing the two shots.

 it. The elephant cries out in pain and runs off, but doesn't get far 
enough away to escape its fate. 

Makris fires another shot and the animal lets out a long, loud groan. Then Makris begins chuckling.

'Somebody got a little cheeky there,' he says breathlessly, apparently referring to the elephant's struggle to stay alive. 

'Can we shoot some birds this afternoon, or...?' he adds.

In the next shot, Makris and the hunting guide are standing next to the lifeless elephant. 

'You snuck us right in this guy's 
bedroom,' Makris says, marveling at his work. 'I mean look at this, this
 is where he hangs out!'

'He didn't know we were here, but what a hunt!' Afterwards, the men celebrate by drinking champagne.

Deadspin, which first reported on the show, points out that a ban on hunting elephants is set to go into effect in Botswana in 2014.

Some NBC Sports viewers are now calling on the network to cancel the show.

Twitter user Mike Potter called NBC's airing of the show 'outrageous, obscene, unforgivable and just plain wrong.'

Another user added: 'Shame on you for "Under Wild Skies." Elephants are endangered and this is NOT a sport. I will no longer watch NBC Sports.'

Makris is the chairman of Mercury Group, a public relations agency that is largely responsible for transforming the NRA from a sportsman's group into one of Washington's most powerful lobbying organizations

On Facebook, David Dunaway posted to the 'Under Wild Skies' page, 'Dear NBC Sports: This is a huge mistake. I am pretty disgusted that you would show elephant hunting.'

After the kill, the men celebrated by drinking champagne

User Alex Kenney tweeted, 'You aired an elephant being shot in the face?...for sport? If I find out this 'Under Wild Skies' show isn't cancelled GOODBYE [NBC Sports Network].'

On Facebook, David Dunaway posted to the 'Under Wild Skies' page, 'Dear NBC Sports: This is a huge mistake. I am pretty disgusted that you would show elephant hunting. Your brand is terribly damaded by this.'

Andrew Schaefer added: 'How anyone could glorify that type of killing is beyond me, let alone televise it when children are watching? We couldn't change the channel fast enough.'

Makris is the chairman of Mercury Group, a public relations agency that is largely responsible for transforming the NRA from a sportsman's group into one of Washington's most powerful lobbying organizations, according to a February 2013 article in the Washington Post.
