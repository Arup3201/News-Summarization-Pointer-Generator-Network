Colourful celebrations continued in Jerusalem today where ultra-orthodox Jewish men gathered to dance in honour of the the traditional festival of Purim.

Revellers and children also met in the streets of the city dressed up as kings and queens, clowns, animals and even superheroes to celebrate.

Yesterday saw similar festivities sweep across the world with thousands of Jewish families in London also celebrating the event in style.

The holiday commemorates the salvation of the Jewish people in ancient Persia after a beautiful queen, Esther, foiled a royal advisor's plot to annihilate all the country's Jews in just one day.

It is traditionally marked with parades, the giving of presents, and by observers sporting a host of colourful costumes which traditionally take their cue from the Biblical story of Esther, but can also include anything from sailors to Superman, as these photographs taken today in Stamford Hill, north London, show.

Celebrations marked the holy day across the globe, and even the wintry weather in New York couldn't dampen spirits as families made their way to synagogues through the snow.

The Jewish holiday Purim commemorates the salvation of the Jewish people in the ancient Persian Empire from a plot intended to wipe them out.

The story, which is recorded in the Biblical Book of Esther, tells the tale of how an advisor to King Ahasuerus named Haman planned to kill all the Jews, only for his wicked plot to be thwarted by the king's wife Esther and her adoptive father Mordecai. 

Haman had selected a day on which he would annihilate the entire Jewish population and had sent out a decree bearing the King's seal, ordering that every Jewish man, woman and child.

But Esther - who had been chosen as Ahasuerus's wife by taking part in a beauty contest and concealing the fact she was Jewish - later convinced the King to send out a new decree allowing the Jews to rise up and defend themselves - thus saving their lives.

'It is commemorated with a day of feasting with presents of food and charity given to the poor,' a member of staff at The Board of Deputies of British Jews told MailOnline.

'The story is read out in synagogues and it really is a carnival. It's a very happy time.

'Children traditionally get dressed up as Esther, or the King but they can wear anything they like really. And in the synagogue they are given football rattles and noisemakers to drown out Haman's name so it's great fun.

'People go from house to house to give presents of food, such as cake or biscuits and something to drink like wine or juice.

'It's the best time for children because they can go to the synagogue, get dressed up and have lots of fun.'
