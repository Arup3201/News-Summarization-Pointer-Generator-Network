West Brom head coach Alan Irvine believes Georgios Samaras' Greece snub can benefit the Baggies.

The striker has been axed by Greece for their Euro 2016 qualifier with the Faroe Islands and friendly with Serbia next month.

He has struggled to make an impact at The Hawthorns since a free transfer from Celtic in the summer and has paid the price with Greece.

Georgios Samaras is yet to make an impression at West Brom after signing on a free from Celtic

But, ahead of Saturday's trip to Leicester, Irvine believes it will give the hitman the chance to regain his fitness.

'It will give us an opportunity to work with him. It'll give us an opportunity that we had with the likes of Sebastian Blanco,' he said.

'From our point of view it is a good thing. Hopefully from Sammy's point of view, ultimately, it's a good thing. I'm sure he'll be bitterly disappointed not to be in the squad because he's the captain.'

Samaras has been snubbed from Greece's next two games in November

The 29-year-old is yet to start this term after playing in the summer's World Cup meant he was behind on his fitness.

Irvine said: 'He's not been ready, he's not been fit enough. I have said all along if you miss pre-season life is very difficult. It's difficult to get fit when other players are doing sessions as you are making sure they are doing the right levels.

'Sammy didn't do a pre-season, he had the World Cup which meant he was having his rest when everyone else was working.

The West Brom forward has been a mainstay in the Greece set-up before his move to The Hawthorns

'Other players who missed pre-season were able to top up but he would have spent previous international breaks preparing for games rather than getting ready.

'He needs to get to the right level physically. He has to get the most out of every training session he can.'

Jonas Olsson is still sidelined with an Achilles problem while Silvestre Varela is out for the weekend after groin surgery but did return to training on Thursday.

'Only Jonas Olsson did not train, everyone else did including Silvestre. It was his first full session since coming back from injury,' Irvine added.

'We are very pleased with that but he is still a long way away from being able to play in the Premier League.'
