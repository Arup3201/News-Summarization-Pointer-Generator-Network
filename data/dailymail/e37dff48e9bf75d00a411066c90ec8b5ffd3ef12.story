Ralph Fiennes has revealed that he 
met James Bond producers to discuss taking over the iconic role from Timothy Dalton in the 1990s - but now thinks he would have been 'terrible' 
in the role.

The actor, who
 now stars alongside Daniel Craig in the Bond films as M, the leader of 
MI6, recalled how he was interviewed over the role 20 years ago.

Mr
 Fiennes, 51, who starred in The English Patient and played Lord 
Voldemort in the Harry Potter films, said he wasn't ready to commit to 
the part, and implied that a mutual decision was reached not to proceed.

Decisions: Ralph Fiennes, pictured at the Skyfall premier in 2012, did not take up the role of James Bond, which instead went to Pierce Brosnan, pictured right in 2002 starring in Die Another Day

In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph's
 Seven magazine, Mr Fiennes said: ' There was a conversation that was 
great... I think that's all I can say, except that it didn't lead to 
anything on both sides.'

He added: 'I think I would've been a terrible 
Bond, actually. I think I'm happier playing M. And I think Daniel Craig 
is a brilliant Bond.'

Producers
 for the Bond franchise instead chose Pierce Brosnan, now 60, for the role. His 
first appeared as 007 in GoldenEye (1995) and continued in Tomorrow 
Never Dies (1997), The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Die Another Day 
(2002).

He handed over to Mr Craig for Casino Royale in 2006.

Bond role at last: Mr Fiennes was introduced in Skyfall (2012) as Gareth Mallory

Successor: Fiennes will star alongside Daniel Craig (left) after his character in the franchise succeeded Dame Judi Dench (right) as M

Mr Fiennes made his 
debut in the Bond films as Gareth Mallory in Skyfall two years ago. His 
character had been a senior official in the British intelligence agency,
 and is promoted to the role of M after Dame Judi Dench's character is 
killed.

He will continue the role in Bond 24, the next film in the long-running series, which is expected to be released in 2015.

Mr Fiennes will also soon star in Wes Andersonâ€™s The Grand Budapest Hotel, which premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival earlier this year and is released in the UK this Friday.

He plays Gustave H, a hotel concierge who is on a mission to prove his innocence after being framed for his fatherâ€™s murder.
