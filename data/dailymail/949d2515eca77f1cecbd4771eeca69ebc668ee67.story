Poppy Knight, 22, pictured outside court, helped her lover Christopher Zeb groom the schoolgirl and filmed an orgy between the three

A young sadistic couple acted out dark sexual fantasies on a 14-year-old girl after grooming her on internet chat rooms, a court heard today.

Married engineer Christopher Zeb, 26, and his deviant mistress Poppy Knight, 22, blindfolded, bit and bruised their teenage victim in a seedy 24-hour sex session in a hotel.

The schoolgirl, whose name police found in a document in Zeb's home entitled 'Slaves In Training', told her mother she was going to stay with a schoolfriend before catching a train to Manchester and spending the night with the couple.

A judge today condemned the pair's 'serious sexual offences' as he jailed Zeb for six-and-a-half years and Knight for 30 months.

Sitting
at Oxford Crown Court, Judge Ian Pringle heard that married Zeb began 
an extramarital affair with Knight in 2011, which 'quickly developed 
into a sadistic sexual relationship'.

Within the relationship, Knight acted as her lover's consenting 'slave', taking pleasure in him inflicting pain upon her.

But Zeb also trawled websites and chat rooms looking for younger 'slaves' to feed his sexual desires.

On Easter Sunday last year, Zeb and 
Knight travelled to Manchester to meet a 14-year-old girl from Bolton, 
Lancashire, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

Prosecutor
Cathy Olliver said: 'During the Easter holidays in 2012, she lied to 
her mother about going to a friend's house in Bolton. Instead she got 
the train to Manchester.

'Mr Zeb and Miss Knight picked her up at the station and drove her to a hotel.'

After going out for a meal together, 
the trio went upstairs to the bedroom where the girl was blindfolded and
twice forced to perform a sex act on Zeb.

They
then made a 'den' out of bedclothes in the room which all they entered 
into naked, and began an orgy which Knight filmed.  As she did so, she 
encouraged the girl, the court heard.'

Poppy Knight had brought the morning after pill for her, so she didn't use condoms', the prosecutor said.

Christopher Zeb, 26, and Poppy Knight, 22, were today both jailed after admitting grooming a child for sex.

'Poppy Knight is fully participating 
and praises her...It's clear from [the girl's] interview she was not 
aware she was being filmed'.

She added: 'Her parents had no idea 
where she was that evening. They didn't know she was in a hotel in a 
strange city or what was happening to her for that entire night.'

The
girl, who had returned home with bite marks and bruises after her 
ordeal, did not complain to the police, but the alarm was raised when 
the father of a 12-year-old girl from Humberside raised the alarm after 
discovering Zeb was grooming her online.

Relatives of Zeb and Knight were at Oxford Crown Court today to hear Judge Ian Pringle hand down his sentence

The horrified father found out she had sent Zeb pictures of herself and he had asked to meet up with her.

Police
raided Zeb's marital home in Banbury, Oxfordshire, last September and 
seized his computer and a mobile phone found hidden in his loft.

Detectives
discovered the hotel room video on his computer, along with a word 
document entitled 'Slaves In Training' which detailed girls he was 
targeting on the internet.

They
also found sexual pictures Zeb had encouraged both the 12 and 14 year 
old girls to email to him after he'd set them tasks to 'please daddy'.

Zeb and Knight lured the schoolgirl to Manchester and took her out for dinner before beginning an all-night orgy

When police seized the girls' phones, they found Zeb's phone number stored in them saved under the name 'Master'.

Mrs Olliver said: 'It was clear he had contacted, in a sexualised manner, a number of girls.'

Investigating officers also found that Knight had been in contact with the 14-year-old girl they met in Manchester.

In an email exchange read out in court, she told the schoolgirl they were 'slave sisters' and they had to please Zeb.

Zeb had admitted nine offences, including abducting a child, meeting a female aged under 16 after sexual grooming and five child sex offences. One count referred to sexual activity with a child aged under 13.

Knight, of Banbury, had admitted eight similar offences related only to the 14-year-old girl.

Shocked relatives of the pair, including Zeb's parents, sat in silence in the public gallery as Knight's counsel David Bright claimed she was also one of Zeb's victims and that she was following orders as his slave because of his 'evil and malign influence'.

Zeb's defence counsel Trudi Yeatman told the judge: 'He's not in denial. He fully accepts the extent of his offending.'

Mrs Yeatman added that Zeb and Knight's relationship was 'dark and often sadistic' but at all times consensual between the two of them.

Judge Pringle said to Zeb: 'I've had to look at seven clips and videos which depict clearly what took place.  You were the main perpetrator of that abuse, and abuse it was.'

He said to both: 'You subjected that girl to all forms of intercourse and I would be failing grossly in my duty if I was not to impose on both of you a sentence of immediate imprisonment.'

The judge ordered Zeb and Knight sign the sex offenders register and be banned from contact with children. He also banned them from using the internet on a computer not fitted with police monitoring software.
