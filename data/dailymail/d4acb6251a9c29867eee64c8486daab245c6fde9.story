Alleged assault: A teenage boy says Herbert Daniel Ortiz allegedly sexually assaulted him after his mother recognised the man in a YouTube video

A mother found out her teenage son had been sexually assaulted by a wrestling coach after she watched a YouTube video made by another victim.

The online video made by another male alleged that he had been victimised by Herbert Daniel Ortiz, 29, a coach at the Bad News Panthers Children’s Wrestling Club in Rosemead, California.

On seeing the video, the mother recognised Ortiz and asked her 14-year-old son if he had been a victim to which he revealed that he allegedly had.

In a written statement the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said: ‘In the video, another male alleged he was victimized by the suspect and was warning viewers, specifically those residing in Rosemead, California, to protect their children. 

‘The mother recognised the suspect as a former assistant wresting coach at Rosemead High School and asked her 14-year-old son if he had been a victim. 

‘Her son then disclosed the sexual abuse by the suspect.’

Ortiz was a former assistant wrestling coach at Rosemead High School from 2007 to 2009 and then was a founding coach at the children’s wrestling club in 2010.

Authorities said Ortiz was aware of the YouTube video. 

Detectives have been unable to locate Ortiz and believe he is trying to elude authorities and his last known residence was in Baldwin Park in California, according to the department.

The alleged assaults occurred in Californian cities Rosemead, El Monte and Baldwin Park after Ortiz befriended the suspect.

Investigators believe there may be additional victims who may have been sexually abused by the suspect.

The children’s wrestling club sells itself on the website as ‘an outlet for local youths to come and test their inner strengths.’
