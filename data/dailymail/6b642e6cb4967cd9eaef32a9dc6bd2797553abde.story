The teenage girl at the centre of the Bali body in the suitcase murder has been smuggled out of hospital by police and lawyers clutching her tightly wrapped baby in her arms.

Heather Mack, 19, accused of murdering her wealthy socialite mother, Sheila Von Weise-Mack, 62, held on to her baby tightly this afternoon as she left hospital under police guard to be returned with the child to Bali's notorious Kerobokan prison.

She has already made it clear that she intends to keep her daughter, named as Stella Schaefer after her co-accused Tommy Schaefer, 21, in prison with her for the first two years of the child's life - a mother-baby relationship that jail authorities allow.

Miss Mack gave birth to the 6lb 1oz baby last Wednesday in a Caesarian operation - several weeks ahead of time.

It was believed that because of the baby's premature delivery the child would have to remain in an incubator at the Sanglah Hospital while her mother was returned to prison, where she is being held as her trial and that of her boyfriend proceeds through the Denpasar district court.

But in a flurry of movement at the hospital this afternoon a prosecutor's car arrived and Miss Mack was ushered into it after being transported out of the hospital in a wheelchair.

Despite the emotional scenes, administrative affairs had to be dealt with - one of Miss Mack's legal team had to settle the hospital bill, paying $6000 with his credit card, which he will claim back from the many thousands of dollars that have been released to him from Miss Mack's Trust account. 

She clutched her tightly wrapped daughter throughout under cover of a large shawl as photographers and camera crews followed her closely, continuing to film her once she was inside the car. 

When Miss Mack reached the prison the shawl around the baby's head slipped away as she struggled to release her seat belt, giving a handful of people outside  the first glimpse of the youngster, who had become famous before her face had even been seen.

Ironically, it was the mother Miss Mack has been accused of murdering in the upmarket St Regis Hotel, in Bali's Nusa Dua beachside suburb, who set up the Trust account to be available for her legal expenses.

Now some have had to be used for 'baby expenses'. 

Mrs von Wiese Mack's badly-beaten body was found in a blood-spattered suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the St. Regis Hotel on August 12. She had been on vacation with her daughter and Schaefer at the time.

The couple have told police that Mrs von Wiese Mack objected after finding out about her daughter’s pregnancy and during a fierce argument, Schaefer struck Heather’s mother with the metal handle of a fruit bowl while her daughter hid in the bathroom. 

The grandmother of Miss Mack’s newly-born daughter has been having ‘intense discussions’ with the teenager about the future of the baby girl who is destined to spend the first two years of her life behind bars in Bali

Ms Kia Walker has flown from her home near Chicago to stay in the hospital where Miss Mack has given birth to the daughter.

Ms Walker, Mr Schaefer’s mother, is understood to be concerned the baby girl will remain with Miss Mack in prison when a court verdict is delivered in the next few weeks.  

Since this shot was taken Miss Mack has been smuggled out of hospital and back to Bali's notorious Kerobokan prison along with her baby daughter, with whom she is being allowed to stay for now

In a desperate attempt to come to an arrangement for her granddaughter’s immediate future, it is understood Ms Walker has been talking in detail to Miss Mack about her intended plans to keep the baby with her in the prison for the full two years that babies are allowed to remain there with their mothers.

‘The discussions have been pretty intense,’ said a hospital source. ‘There has been a lot of pressure on Heather to think again about keeping a baby in a prison cell for the first years of her life.’

It has not been revealed whether Ms Walker has offered to look after her grandchild - or whether the same offer has been made from Miss Mack’s relatives.

'There is no doubt she is concerned about the welfare of the baby,' said the source.

Mr Schaefer’s mother has been seen through a hospital window talking to her at length, and has also been observed standing on a hospital balcony, smoking cigarettes.

While she has not spoken publicly about her son’s murder case - nor about the birth of his baby - she revealed on social media in October that a plea for donations to help pay for her son’s legal fees had reached $10,600.
