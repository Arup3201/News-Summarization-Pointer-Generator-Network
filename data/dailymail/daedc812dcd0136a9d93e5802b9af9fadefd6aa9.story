With Arsenal completing the signing of Calum Chambers, their other right back was embarking on his first official day with the club.

Mathieu Debuchy, the £10million arrival from Newcastle, posted a picture on board a plane to Austria ahead of their four-day training camp.

The France defender sat next to international team-mate Laurent Koscielny and the pair appeared braced for an emotional journey if the box of tissues are anything to go by.

Debuchy’s first day coincided with the assigning of Chambers from Southampton.

‘I am so happy to be signing for Arsenal,’ the 19-year-old said.

‘They are a team I have much admired for their playing style, and a team who have been one of the top sides in Europe for many years. I'm looking forward to joining up with my new team-mates today and beginning preparation for the season ahead.

‘I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to everyone at Southampton FC for everything they have done for me and for making this move possible.’

Manager Arsene Wenger added of his fourth summer arrival following deals for Alexis Sanchez, Debuchy, and goalkeeper David Ospina, added: ‘We are very pleased that Calum has agreed to join us.

‘The way he adapted to the Premier League last season with Southampton at a young age shows that he has tremendous quality. He has a lot of the attributes that we look for in a young player and I am sure that he will do well with us.’
