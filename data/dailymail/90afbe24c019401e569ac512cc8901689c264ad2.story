A young brother and sister have discovered both their parents dead in their Massachusetts home from what police suspect was a heroin overdose.

The Essex district attorney’s office says foul play is not suspected in the deaths of the Haverhill husband and wife.

Spokeswoman Carrie Kimball-Monahan said Sunday that state police are investigating the 'unattended' deaths of the 39-year-old man and 36-year-old woman whose lifeless bodies were discovered Saturday at their home on Lamoille Avenue in Haverhill.

Heartbreaking find: A 10-year-old boy and his 8-year-old sister have discovered their parents dead from a suspected heroin overdose inside this Haverhill, Massachusetts home 

She said the couple’s 10-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter discovered their parents dead at around 10.45am and called their grandmother.

The grandmother called a friend living nearby, who went to the home and then called 911.

Kimball-Monahan said the state Department of Children and Families responded to the scene as is routine, and the children are now in the custody of their grandmother.

Neighbors said that family had moved into the brown two-story home at 7 Lamoille Avenue only a few weeks ago.

When police officers responded to the 911 call Saturday morning, the rental property was decorated for the holidays with red, white and gold ribbons tied around the porch and a festive Christmas wreath hanging on the front door.

A medical examiner will conduct autopsies to determine the causes of death, but sources within the police department tell the Eagle Tribune they suspect heroin may have played a role.

Haverhill - a community of 60,000 located 35 miles north of Boston - has found itself in recent years at the center of Essex County's devastating heroin epidemic.

The city has the second highest number of  heroin deaths so far this year, with 22 confirmed fatalities.

On Sunday, the Salvation Army held a 'No More' candlelight vigil at the City Hall to remember those who have lost their lives to drugs and send a message of hope to people battling addiction.
