Facing jail: Joseph Bucci's spending spree could cost him his freedom

A man is facing a 14-year jail sentence after he spent almost $70,000 that was put into his bank account by mistake.

Joseph Bucci, from Trevose, Pennsylvania, was stunned with he discovered $69,300 in his account - particularly as, only a week before, his balance had been a mere $35.

However, instead of telling the bank there had been a mistake he did what, no doubt, many would be tempted to do: He spent it.

Unemployed Bucci bought himself a used Pontiac, a golden retriever and a trip to Orlando with the money.

He also splashed out on food, furniture and clothes - as well as paying off bills for his family members, it was reported.

The money was due to be placed in escrow for an estate but a typo made by a bank teller at Wells Fargo resulted in the money being transferred to Bucci's account instead.

The bank realised the error when the recipients noticed their money was  missing and contacted police.

Andrew Aninsman, a Bensalem police sergeant, told CBS News: 'I guess he thought he was in elementary school and found a quarter on the ground and said "Finders keepers, losers weepers".'

Bucci is thought to have turned himself in to police, ABC News reported.

He has been charged with theft of property lost and receiving stolen property - both of which are third-degree felonies. He faces jail sentence of up to 14 years in prison.

Bucci told CBS News: 'There was a sense of wow... just look at it for a while. I knew it was going to catch up to me. I just didn't know it was going to be this bad.'

He was arraigned before Bensalem District Judge Joseph Falcone and was released on a $25,000 unsecured bail.

A spokesman for Wells Fargo said the bank was working closely with the police.
