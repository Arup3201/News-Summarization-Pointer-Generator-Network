It might not be as glitzy as a sprawling honeymoon suite, or a Parisian penthouse.

But a picturesque room at a Vietnamese beach hotel has just been awarded the title of sexiest hotel room after being honoured in a list of the world’s best boutique hotels.

Water Villa number 5 at the Six Senses hotel is perched on the edge of Ninh Van Bay in Nha Trang, and overlooks a coral reef, faces the sunset and can only be accessed by a hillside staircase to ensure total privacy.

It was voted top in the sexiest bedroom category by judges at this year’s Smith Hotel Awards.

The annual awards ceremony, which was hosted by boutique guide and booking agent Mr & Mrs Smith, pitted more than 950 properties in the agency’s collection head-to-head across 12 categories.

More than 20,000 members of the public voted for their favourite stays throughout September.

The shortlists were then put to a panel of three judges in each category.

Water Villa 5 beat Suite 57 at the Viceroy Hotel in New York to be named sexiest bedroom, while the suite at the Bellevue Syrene in Sorrento was also a runner-up.

The room measures 154 sq meters and comes with its own plunge pool, split level layout, private sunbathing deck, handcrafted bathtub and dedicated 24-hour butler service.

It also has its own mini wine cellar.

The Smith Hotel Awards discussed the judging criteria for the sexiest bedroom award, saying: ‘Romance comes in many guises – and there are no hard and fast rules for creating the perfect boudoir.

‘But some things we can all agree on: it has to delight, excite, and surprise.

‘A room ripe for seduction needs to do more than get the basics right: the hotel you think is home to the Sexiest Bedroom in the World will pull out all the stops to light your fire. 

'There's no stinting on quality; the lighting is just-so; maybe the minibar has a few fun extras, or the view's a corker.’

Speaking about the winning hotel, the judges said: ‘It was a tough category to call, but the judges agreed that Six Senses’ five ravishingly romantic Water Villas were deserving winners: set right on the ocean, overlooking a coral reef, they’re secluded, private and impossible to leave.

‘Water Villa 5 is the pick of the bunch, with an infinity-edge plunge pool set seductively into the rocks, a private ladder leading into the ocean, and rustic-luxe good looks that conjure a cocoon of pure castaway romance.’

Last year’s winner of the sexiest bedroom title was the Cardinal suite at Blake’s Hotel in London.

The hotel was described as 'an escapist blend of OTT luxury, creativity and indulgence, with rooms reflecting a wide range of themes and eras'.

According to the judges on that occasion, the suite itself ‘is shamelessly romantic: with heavy, textured fabrics, floral artwork and the kind of ornate, crimson-draped four-poster that makes you reach for the smelling salts, it’s an essay in decorative decadence’.
