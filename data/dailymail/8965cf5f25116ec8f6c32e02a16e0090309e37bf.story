Scandal-hit Barclays has appointed insider Antony Jenkins on a package of up to £8.6million to replace disgraced former chief executive Bob Diamond.

Mr Jenkins, 51, from Stoke-on-Trent – who is described by colleagues as the 'nice guy' of banking – admitted it was 'not a job for the faint-hearted'.

Announcement of his appointment came just hours after the bank admitted it faces a criminal investigation led by the Serious Fraud Office for its dealings with Qatari investors.

Boss: Antony Jenkins has vowed to overhaul the bank after being named as immediate successor to Bob Diamond

The probe concerns payments made to the Middle Eastern investors at the height of the financial crisis when they backed a rescue deal that gave Barclays a £4.5billion lifeline.

Mr Jenkins most recently was head of Barclays's retail and business banking arm, looking after 50million customers and 90,000 staff worldwide.

He promised to put customers 'at the centre of what we do', and admitted Barclays had made grave errors, including mis-selling PPI loan insurance that cost it £1.3billion in compensation.

'We have made serious mistakes in recent years and clearly failed to keep pace with our stakeholders' expectations,' he said.

The keen marathon runner and married father-of-two is a veteran of Barclays, having joined its management development programme in 1983.

He returned to the bank in 2006 to run Barclaycard after a 16-year spell at rival US bank Citigroup, which this week paid £373million to settle a legal dispute with shareholders over claims it lied over its huge investments in toxic loans.

Former boss: Bob Diamond was once described by Lord Mandleson as the 'unacceptable face of banking' and was forced out of his job after the Libor rate-rigging scandal earlier this year

Barclays has endured one of the most 
turbulent periods in its history after it was fined £290 million by UK 
and US regulators for manipulating Libor, an interbank lending rate 
which affects mortgages and loans

He will not enjoy the same riches as 
his predecessor, who scooped £17million last year, but critics 
complained he has still hit the jackpot.

Mr
Jenkins will receive a basic salary of £1.1million and an annual bonus 
of up to £2.75million, as well as shares in Barclays's long-term 
incentive plan worth up to £4.4million and a cash allowance of £363,000 
instead of a pension.

Deborah Hargreaves of the High Pay Centre 
think-tank said: 'By anyone's standards this is still a massive amount 
of money.

Educated at Oxford University, Mr Jenkins, 51, began his career at Barclays nearly 30 years ago, when he completed the Barclays Management Development Programme before going on to hold various roles in retail and corporate banking.

He moved to Citigroup in 1989, working in both London and New York and most recently held a senior role in the credit card division.

He re-joined Barclays as chief executive of Barclaycard in January 2006 and was appointed chief executive of retail and business banking, with a seat on the executive committee, in November 2009.

Married for 28 years and a father of two, he comes from Stoke-on-Trent and spends his spare time running marathons.

Where his predecessor Mr Diamond was regarded as a brash, American investment banker - once described by Lord Mandelson as the 'unacceptable face of banking' due to his lavish pay deals - Mr Jenkins is a far more conservative choice.

'If Barclays is really serious about 
cleaning up its act there needs to be a fairer pay policy, with people 
at the bottom given a fair wage and those at the top showing more 
restraint.'

Mr Jenkins admitted his salary is 'a 
lot of money' but claimed his basic pay was 'slightly below the  median'
for bosses in the FTSE 100 index.

Mr Diamond was forced to quit in July
after the bank was fined £290million in a separate scandal over rigging
crucial Libor interest rates. Chairman Marcus Agius also resigned.

It is thought Barclays made a 
conscious effort to steer clear of hiring another 'casino' banker' to 
replace Mr Diamond, after the revelations of traders promising each 
other champagne to fiddle the rates caused the lender's reputation to 
sink to a new low.

The bank's chief financial officer Chris Lucas is 
one of four individuals being investigated by the Financial Services 
Authority over Middle Eastern transactions.

Critics pointed out Mr Jenkins was at 
the helm at Barclaycard while it mis-sold payment protection insurance 
to customers alongside credit cards.

He yesterday insisted the worst of the mis-selling occurred before he joined.

However, he was also boss of the 
retail bank when it was fined £7.7million in January last year for 
luring thousands of elderly customers into risky investments.

Marc Gander, of the Consumer Action 
Group, said: 'How on earth does Barclays expect to restore public 
confidence unless it brings in someone from outside the bank with clean 
hands? Jenkins was in the thick of a number of important scandals.'

The Financial Services Authority was 
already investigating Barclays over concerns surrounding rescue deals 
totalling £11.5billion with Qatar and Abu Dhabi. It is one of a number 
of banks under investigation over Libor rigging.

Barclays raised nearly £11 billion at
the time, which effectively allowed the bank to avoid following in the 
footsteps of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland by taking a state 
bailout.
