A Household Cavalry lance corporal, who escorted Prince William and Kate Middleton during the Royal wedding, tried to smother his girlfriend after a row about cold toast.

Tank commander Daniel Ridge, 31, pinned Johanna Cade, his girlfriend of two years, to their bed and vowed to leave the nurse and part-time model in a pool of blood, a court heard.

Ridge, of Combermere Barracks, Windsor, then squirted shower gel over the 27-year-old's clothes and put a £300 pair of her boots in a pan of boiling water.

He was convicted at Wimbledon Magistrates Court of assaulting Miss Cade at her flat in south west London, on October 5, last year, and causing criminal damage to her clothing.

Magistrates sentenced him to 12 months' probation, including 100 hours community service work yesterday.

He was also ordered to pay Miss Cade £300 in compensation for the assault, £370 for damage, £620 in court costs and an £80 victim surcharge. 

Ridge, who has served in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, and his mount Vengeful escorted the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, as well as the Queen, from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace after their wedding on April 29 in 2011.

Speaking before the wedding, he had said: 'My mum has set the video and she and my grandparents will be able to follow it all on telly and hopefully recognise me.'

But yesterday, the court heard how he threw eggs and glass tumblers at her after becoming angry when she had remarked that the toast he had made was cold.

Miss Cade told the court: 'I went to the kitchen and he was making breakfast. I said: 'The toast is cold' and his response was: 'Fine, don't have it. I'll make my own, not yours.

'He picked an egg up and threw it at me. I dodged that one and he threw another one at me and I dodged that one. He was quite angry and intense and I was disgusted and frightened.

'He raised a glass tumbler up in the air and threw that at me. I moved and it hit the floor behind me then he raised up a second one and threw it at me and again I moved.'

She added that he then smeared avocado on her coat before wrapping her in the duvet, leaving her unable to breathe as he throttled her neck. 

The defendant told the court that he had playfully 'lobbed' two eggs towards Miss Cade to lighten the mood and she deliberately placed the two glasses on the floor before the police arrived.

He added that Miss Cade had attacked him, leaving scratches on his neck as well as a cut and he wrapped her in the duvet to restrict her 'flailing' arms.

'She grabbed me and pulled me around the kitchen a bit and started hitting me on the back of the head in a pawing cat-like motion,' he said.

'I got punched in the face and wanted to stop getting hurt and grabbed the duvet to use as a barrier between me and her.'

He also claimed that Miss Cade had used one of his trainers to wipe the smashed egg off the floor and told police that in a moment of 'childish retaliation' he decided to damage her clothes. 

But Miss Cade insisted she was 'petrified' as Ridge launched the attack.

'I was petrified, stunned, frozen and started to cry and he went into my bedroom, got the duvet that was on my bed, and threw it over my head and body,' she said.

'I said: 'Get off, I can't breathe.' He had hold of me by the arms and then I was dragged into the bedroom with the duvet over me and pinned to the bed, with hands I think it was, around my neck.

'I couldn't see anything and at first I was very frightened and tried moving, wriggling out and became quite panicked and I managed to get my arm out.

'I reached up and I think I grabbed his ear. I hit the side of his face and made a scratch. I was frightened, I knew I had to get out from being suffocated and held by the throat.'  

Miss Cade added: 'I remember feeling the blood drain from my body. I could feel myself shutting off and not being able to breathe at all. I felt very, very dizzy.' 

Ridge eventually left when she threatened to call the police, and Miss Cade added: 'I was sweating, so, so frightened. I've never felt so vulnerable and fearful for my life.'

She later photographed herself, revealing a bruise to her right elbow, a red mark on her left arm, a red mark to her lower back and a red mark to the right side of her chest. 

And she was forced to throw out much of the stained clothing, including a £70 coat and said added she had a £550 quote to re-decorate her bedroom. 

The court also heard her recall previous incidents when Ridge had lost his temper, including smashing her phone in a fit of anger. 

'He once locked me out of his house in Devon at 3am while in my underwear and in the rain and has repeatedly dumped me on roadsides and driven off,' she said.

'Last August, I was very ill with what turned out to be meningitis and Daniel refused to take me to hospital. I begged him to take me to hospital.'

She disagreed with a defence claim that Ridge was a 'gentleman' throughout their relationship and recalled how he had let her down during follow-up treatment. 'He drove off and shouted out the window of his car: 'Get the bus to hospital.'

Ridge told the court: 'It was a childish matter that shouldn't really have happened. My clothes were ruined as well, but I didn't think it was right to press charges.

'At no point did I throw any glasses. I did not use any aggression and I did not raise my hands to her.'

His lawyer, Mr. David Allman told the court yesterday: 'He's been a professional member of the armed services since the age of eighteen and he's currently intending to continue that career for at least nine years.

'He is seeking promotion and that would have happened fairly soon had this court case not occurred. His promotion is now on hold.

'I am asking you to take into account the background of his service career, his duty for his country.'

Magistrate Fiona Abbott, making an indefinite restraining order prohibiting Ridge from contacting Miss Cade, said he had subjected her to 'gratuitous degradation' and 'mental anguish'.

Ms Abbot said: 'It happened in the victim's home and there was gratuitous degradation in the way you spoke to the victim,

'The compensation is for the bruising and mental anguish caused by this assault.'

She added: 'You denied your actions and minimised your part in them and the effect on your victim.'
