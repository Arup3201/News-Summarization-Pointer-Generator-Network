Australians are among the world's earliest risers, with nearly half of all Aussies getting out of bed before 7am, according to a new study.

The study, carried out to celebrate World Sleep Day, found that 45 per cent of Australians surveyed got their day started before 7am, which was earlier than most other participants in the study.

It also found Australians on average go to bed earlier than people in other countries.

88 per cent of Australians said sleep has the biggest influence on their overall happiness, beating out other factors such as their job, social life, or relationship

However, despite the early starts, the majority of Australians have their sleep interrupted by financial or work worries.

Among a list of 13 factors, 30 per cent of Australian respondents said financial or economic issues kept them up at night, with a further 23 per cent saying work caused the most sleepless nights. Only 18 per cent said technology, such as smartphones or tablets, was the biggest reason they couldn't get to sleep.
