Philip Hollobone, MP for Kettering, said countries in receipt of British aid should be forced to improve their prisons

British aid should be spent building prisons in developing countries so more foreign criminals can be deported, MPs have heard.

Foreigners held in English and Welsh prisons cannot be returned if jails in their home country do not comply with human rights legislation.

But Conservative backbenchers have called for cash from the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Justice to develop prisons overseas to ensure they do comply.

Philip Hollobone, MP for Kettering, insisted Britain should make it conditional to certain countries that aid would only be given if they accepted a prison building programme in order to cooperate with prisoner transfers.

The Tory MP flagged up concerns about Jamaica, Pakistan, Nigeria, Somalia, India and Bangladesh, which were included on what he described as a ‘list of shame’.

He said they received £973million in British aid each year, according to 2012 figures, and had 2,900 of their nationals in English and Welsh prisons, costing taxpayers £100million.

MPs were told there were 10,834 foreign nationals among a prison population of around 85,000 inmates in England and Wales, which cost taxpayers around £300 million a year.

Inmates from 160 countries were held in the jails, with HMP Maidstone and HMP Huntercombe used solely for foreign nationals, the Westminster Hall debate heard.

Opening the debate, Mr Hollobone said he welcomed the fact criminals were serving longer prison sentences, but said there were huge problems as 13 per cent of inmates were foreign nationals in a prison system that ‘is basically full’.

He said 6,174 of the foreign prison population - around 57% - came from 12 nations, referring to a ‘list of shame’ led by Poland and including Ireland, Jamaica and Vietnam.

Conservative Guy Opperman, MP for Hexham, asked Mr Hollobone: ‘Do you agree with me that one way to resolve this problem is to utilise the Dfid and MoJ (Ministry of Justice) budgets to improve the prisons in individual countries like Jamaica ... thereby allowing prisoners to be returned to a human rights compliant jail in their actual homeland?’

Mr Hollobone replied: ‘I think you make an extremely sensible suggestion.

‘I have to say, I don't think my constituents in Kettering are that fussed particularly about the human rights of foreign nationals who commit crimes in this country but understand, as it stands at the moment, we operate under human rights legislation introduced by the previous government and we are not allowed in law to deport criminals to non-human right complaint prisons.

‘I think it does make sense to use the huge and increasing international aid budget to build suitable prisons in countries who provide us with a very large number of prisoners and I think that is a good idea.’

Thousands of foreign criminals are locked in British prisons, but cannot be deported because jails in their own countries do not meet international standards

Mr Hollobone, in reference to the money received by Jamaica, Pakistan, Nigeria, Somalia, India and Bangladesh, added: ‘I believe it would be a good idea to use some of that £973 million on building prisons in those six countries.’

He added: ‘I would go so far as to say I think we should make our international aid to these countries conditional on their acceptance of a prison building programme.

‘I don't think we should give these countries international aid if they are not going to cooperate with us in this regard.’

In his reply, Mr Penning vowed to put ‘whatever rocket’ he could in other Whitehall departments to make progress on Jamaica taking its nationals back if they have committed crimes in the UK.

Mr Penning, also policing minister, said the number of foreign nationals had decreased from 11,153 to 10,843 but it was not right to say ‘all of those would disappear’ should measures in place be implemented, noting as foreign offenders were deported others were arrested.
