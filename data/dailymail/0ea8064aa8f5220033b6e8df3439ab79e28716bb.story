A sideline reporter got a little too close to the action during Sunday night’s football game and got hit in the face with a ball for her troubles.

Fox NFL reporter Pam Oliver was filming a pre-game link during warm-ups on Sunday when she was caught by an errant throw from backup Indianapolis QB Chandler Harnish.

The Indianapolis Colts were in New York to take on the Giants ahead of the new season which starts next month.

Oliver, a seasoned vet with more than 20 years broadcasting experience, was able to laugh off the unpleasant incident. Later she and Harnish were spotted hugging and making up.

Amazingly considering his throw, Harnish earned a reputation for passing accuracy at Northern Illinois.

He performed well enough to get selected in the 2012 NFL draft although as the last player chosen, he did earn the unfortunate title of ‘Mr. Irrelevant.’

Later Harnish also apologized for his wayward actions on Twitter and promised Oliver some flowers.

Would like to take this time to apologize to Pam Oliver, for the bad pass to the face.. Be expecting flowers in the mail soon! #ToughLady

‘Would like to take this time to apologize to Pam Oliver, for the bad pass to the face.. Be expecting flowers in the mail soon! #ToughLady,’ he tweeted.

Watching the footage it isn’t clear who Harnish was attempting to hit with his rogue throw, but Colts starting quarterback Andrew Luck is unlikely to have many sleepless nights worrying about being replaced if that’s how Harnish throws during warmups.
