There are so many make-up trends these days and a myriad of ways to highlight the parts of our face we like and conceal the flaws we're not so happy about.

And then there's the choices about eyeliner style - do you like a thick flicked line or a more subtle touch for just that dash of eye definition?

Frankly it can be hard to decide what to slap on where and many of us still don't quite grasp what suits our faces - but thanks to this amazing infographic, we might just be that little bit closer.

Illustrating the six main face shapes, it explains which eyebrow shapes suit each one best and how to pluck properly, plus how to pick the best blusher and perfect the ever-difficult smokey eye.

There’s also brilliantly detailed and illustrated explanations on how to achieve nine different eyeliner shapes: The Double Flick, Panda Smudge, Slep-in Smudge, Soft Smoke, Arabic, Classic, Thin Flick, Double Mod and the affectionately-named, ‘Winehouse,’ a nod to the late Amy Winehouse’s trademark black liquid eyeliner with a thick wing in the outer crease

It’s tips 
include which blushers you should use for which skins. For example, if 
you have oily skin, powder blush is best and, if you have pale skin, 
pink and coral colours suit most.

Medium skin suits rose and apricot blush best whilst those with darker skin should choose red or plum hues.

‘We thought this infographic would be a great way to break down applying make-up into the simplest steps, so everyone from beginners to professionals can approach it in the most efficient way,’ says Joe Shervell of Datadial.

‘Make-up isn’t about changing who you are – it’s about looking your best and feeling good.’
