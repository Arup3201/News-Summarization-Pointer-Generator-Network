A nephew of Sir Jimmy Savile yesterday told how his celebrity uncle attended ‘paedophile parties’.

Guy Marsden was just 13 when ‘Uncle Jimmy’ took him to a wealthy celebrity’s house in London in 1967 for the first of many sordid social gatherings.

Over the next 18 months, Guy and his friends went to numerous ‘parties’ where he believes men sexually abused girls and boys as young as ten. Savile was at many of these events, he said.

Guy and his teenage friends were used as ‘intermediaries’ to hang out with the younger victims. Guy, now 59, said the youngsters would disappear into the bedrooms with men and return later.

He said there were ‘never any women’ at the parties and although he didn’t see any sexual abuse, it was ‘perfectly obvious’ what was happening. Several household names from the world of showbusiness were party regulars.

Guy said Savile sometimes arrived with a man dressed as a priest and he believed the young victims may have come from an orphanage or children’s home.

He has regularly spoken to friends about his experiences in the late 1960s, but no one took him seriously until this week’s revelations.

‘I have loved all this coming out about Jimmy and I feel guilty I didn’t do something about it earlier,’ he told the Mail yesterday.

After Savile died last year, Guy was one of the relatives who publicly praised him. But he knew he was being a hypocrite. ‘I felt as low and as bad as you can get not saying anything.’

Other members of Savile’s family spoke out last week to condemn a TV programme alleging the DJ sexually abused teenage girls, but the nephew said many relatives were aware of his sordid past.

The roofer from Leeds later married and he now has four children and ten grandchildren with his wife Anne.

The late Jimmy Savile, pictured in the 1970's working as a porter at Leeds General Infirmary, has been accused by his nephew of attending parties in London attended by children as young as ten

But during his youth he was in and out of trouble and believes his seedy experiences in London were to blame for his problems.

Guy came from a large family  – his mother, who was Savile’s sister, gave birth to ‘about 18’ children – and he grew up in a council house in Leeds.

Uncle Jimmy was always the family celebrity. ‘It was like the Beatles coming to your house,’ recalled Guy. ‘He would drive us around in his Rolls-Royce and he gave us a colour television and a telephone.’

At 13, Guy and three friends hitch-hiked to London ‘for an adventure’. They returned home about five weeks later but regularly ran away to the capital for similar periods.

On the first trip in 1967, the group of boys went to Euston Station and were quickly invited to a grubby flat by men who recognised them as easy prey, although Guy says he was never abused.

‘About four days later’, Jimmy Savile turned up at the flat where they were staying. ‘He recognised me and I thought “this is it, I’m going to get in big trouble here”. I hadn’t been in touch with my parents to tell them where I was. But Uncle Jimmy just took us away to a much better place.’

Savile turned up by coincidence at the address because he mixed with ‘fellow child molesters’, said Guy.

The group of runaways ended up in a fabulous house – believed to belong to a famous pop impresario – with a big indoor swimming pool. The celebrity home was one of the party venues.

‘At night you would get about 15 or 20 people turning up. There would be music and tables full of food, we couldn’t believe it. There was everything we needed and we just hung around.

‘At first we automatically assumed the children lived there, but we soon realised they didn’t. They would be brought there, sometimes by Uncle Jimmy, and would stay for six or seven hours until 3 or 4am. They were just little kids, boys and girls.

‘Two or three would go off and come back later. The really strange thing was that they didn’t come out the bedrooms kicking and screaming. None of them seemed to be in any distress, but there is no doubt at all in my mind what they were being used for.

Relation: Guy says that his family will agree that his uncle's body should be removed and cremated

‘They used to say they were “playing.” You heard sounds and moans and groans coming from the bedroom and knew what was going on.’

Guy said he believed he and his friends were there to ‘keep the kids happy’. He said: ‘I didn’t think anything about it at the time, maybe because there was no such thing as paedophiles back then. I never saw Jimmy Savile sexually abuse any of the children, but as far as I am concerned he was part of a paedophile ring at those parties.’

The excursions ended when the teenager got into trouble with the law and was sent to borstal. In later life, Guy said he put his past behind him and became close to Savile. However, they never spoke about what happened and he was concerned that his mother should never find out.

‘Although I was not sexually abused I do feel like a victim myself. I think I should have reported him years ago but I was too scared to do it.

‘Now I am really pleased everyone knows the truth.’
