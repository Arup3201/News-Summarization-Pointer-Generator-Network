Disappointment: One cruisegoer was very unhappy when she realised that Gary Barlow, who apparently once been on the ship, was not aboard for her holiday

Unhappy with your luxury cruise? You might not want to make a fuss.

Because now a disgruntled travel agency has revealed the ten strangest complaints their customers made in the last 12 months.

Top of the list, compiled by bonvoyage.co.uk, was a woman who wanted a sound-proofed room because the noise of the Mediterranean kept her awake.

She was closely followed by a newly wed husband who was furious that he wasn’t offered a private butler to bring him rose petals, strawberries and champagne.

Third place went to the woman who moaned because she wasn’t sent a text prompting her to remember her passport.

And one couple were miffed when the captain ignored their note saying they would be back two hours later than departure time – and left without them.

A young woman on a Hawaiian cruise heard Gary Barlow had once been on her boat – and demanded to know why she hadn’t seen him.

One man on a cruise around Alaska even wanted compensation because the weather was not as warm as he had expected.

An elderly couple who went on a holiday around France and Spain asked for a refund because they weren’t provided with a packed lunch every day.

And a woman on a ship called Celebrity Cruises asked for a full refund last summer because she didn’t see any celebrities on board.

Quirky complaints: One woman grumbled to company Celebrity Cruises that she has not seen any celebrities on her holiday

Rounding off the list was a couple from Yorkshire who moaned that staff were so kind it cost them too much money in tips and a woman who wanted a sea view in her windowless cabin.

Steph Curtin, from bonvoyage.co.uk, said: ‘The vast majority of feedback we get from holidaymakers is hugely positive, telling us what a great time they had, but from time to time we come across a few quirky complaints that we can do little to help.

‘Whilst we make sure we go back to every complaint, I’m afraid we can’t be held responsible for the sea being too loud or the lack of celebrities – as much as we wish we could put Gary Barlow on every cruise!’
