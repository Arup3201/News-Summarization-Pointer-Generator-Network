The first female to play running back in a professional football game doesn't necessarily think women should play alongside men in the NFL.

However, 36-year-old Jennifer Welter hopes signing with the Texas Revolution, a professional indoor team, will inspire other girls to play the sport.

The Revolution recently tried out 5-foot-2, 130-pound, Welter during a game against the North Texas Crunch on Saturday - making her the first woman to play a professional football game in a position other than placeholder or place-kicker.

'I've thought of all the reasons why I might be the wrong person to do 
this. "You're too small, you're too this, you're too that,"' she told 
the Dallas Morning News. 'The truth is if I can change the game, 
literally, for any of those girls, it's worth it.'

Making history: 36-year-old Jennifer Welter became the first female to play a position other than placeholder or place-kicker in a professional football game during her debut with the Texas Revolution on Saturday

Coming out on top: Welter didn't make any successful touchdowns during Saturday's game, but her team still won the game

Tougher than she looks: Welter was hit by men nearly twice her weight on the field

Welter hasn't officially made the team yet as they are still finalizing their season roster. She will find out today if she the cut today.

But her efforts to join the Revolution may have been hindered by her performance in Saturday's game as she didn't score one touchdown and was seriously tackled on several attempts.

Welter made it clear to the other team that she should be treated like any other player, and not to go easy on her.

After taking a particularly hard hit from 6-foot-4, 245-pound lineman Cedric Hearvey, Welter shot back with: 'Is that all you got?'

'They were getting all alive, and I had to say something. I didn't want them to think I was intimidated,' Welter said.

Rolling with the punches: Welter didn't make any touchdowns and took several hits from linemen nearly twice her weight. During one play she was shoved and flew several feet to the ground

Trying: Welter had a handful of unsuccessful touchdown attempts during Saturday's game

Breaking gender norms: Welter said she wanted to join the team not as an advocate for women playing against men but to prove that women are just as passionate about the sport

Welter went on to attempt several other unsuccessful touchdowns while the Crunch refused to hold back.

At first, Hearvey didn't like having to tackle Welter and at one point even called out to the coaches on the sideline to take her out 'because this doesn't feel right'.

'Honestly it was very weird,' Hearvey said after the game. 'Part of me wanted to let her score, but part of me had a job. So I was like, "Can ya'll take her out?"'

But Hearvey has nothing but positive feelings towards Welter.

'Honestly, I really have a lot of respect for that lady over there,' he said.

Crossing her fingers: Welter hasn't officially made the team yet. The Revolution will announce their final season roster on Wednesday

Veteran: Welter has been playing football since 2004 as a member of the Dallas Diamonds, which competes in the Women's Football Alliance (pictured in blue tackling)

Team owner Tommy Benizio says he would like to see her end up on the team, in some capacity.

'Whether it's on the field or off the field, I hope she will become part of the Revolution family for the long term,' Benizio told Fox Sports.

Despite Welter's performance, the Revolution went on to beat the Crunch 64-30.
