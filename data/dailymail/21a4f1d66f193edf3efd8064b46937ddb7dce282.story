Sent for trial: Army veteran David McIntyre, 43, will be extradited to the United States today to stand trial over an alleged £66,000 fraud

A British army veteran who served in Bosnia and Northern Ireland is being extradited to the United States today over an alleged £66,000 fraud.  

David McIntyre, 43, has said he is 'disgusted' with the Government as he travelled to London to be 'hauled in shackles' on board a plane to Washington this afternoon.

He is due to arrive in North America tomorrow and will be held at the high-security Chesapeake Detention Facility in Virginia as the US authorities gather witnesses 'from all corners of the world' to testify against him, he said.

'I am disgusted and I am innocent. I feel let down by the country I love and have fought for,' he said today. 

The fraud case concerns a contract between Mr McIntyre's security firm Quantam Risk and the US Institute of Peace.

It is alleged that McIntyre overcharged the institute by $100,000 (£66,000) when providing security for the group in Iraq during a break from army service. 

He faces eight counts of fraud and a possible 20-year jail term in an American prison. 

No court date has been set.

Mr McIntyre, from Hyde, Tameside  is being extradited despite a long campaign and lawyers' pleas that he poses an 'enduring high risk of suicide' and suffers from severe post traumatic stress disorder

The soldier, who served in the Territorial Army before joining the Queen's Lancashire Regiment in 1996 said: 'I am going today. I have said goodbye to the kids this morning and I will be in processing by Friday.

'I am going to be held there until people are drawn from all corners of the world to testify against me.

'I wanted to get public support behind me, but this has not happened.

'I have lost my job and potentially I am going to lose my family home. I just cannot understand it.

'No one has bothered helping me, and that includes David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May. 

'I just feel let down by the whole of my country.'

Damning: Mr McIntyre says he served his country for decades only to be 'let down for the country I love and fought for'

The nation's top judge however ruled last month that the Bosnia and Northern Ireland veteran would suffer 'no injustice' if extradited to stand trial.

The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, ruled that there was no 'real risk' that the father-of-two would suffer 'inhuman or degrading treatment' within the US penal system and his extradition would not violate his human rights.

He is facing trial on fraud charges relating to alleged over-charging by his private security firm in Iraq in 2008 and 2009 - allegations which he vehemently denies.

A campaign calling on the government to intervene and allow him to stand trial in Britain has attracted 2,000 signatures.

Mr McIntyre left the Army in 2002 and set up security company Quantum Risk, which employed a team to provide security to Americans in Iraq.

It is alleged he overcharged a US organisation by 100,000 US dollars  - £65,000.
