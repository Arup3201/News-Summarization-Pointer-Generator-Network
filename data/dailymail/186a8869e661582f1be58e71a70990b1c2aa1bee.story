Instead of using time zone converters, or having to memorise what hour it is in select locations, this clock reveals the differences simply by rolling it.

The World Clock shows the current time on a traditional-looking face, but the edge of the timepiece is engraved with the times in 24 cities, covering 12 time zones.

It will then revert to the current time zone by rolling back into position, thanks to weights in the base.

To begin, users program the time in their current zone using the mechanism inside the device.

The number on the clock that appears directly below the place name reveals the hour, while the hand shows the minutes.

To see the time in another location, the clock is rolled so the desired place name (printed on the side, pictured right) is at the top of the device. The number on the clock that appears below the place name reveals the hour

For example, if someone living in New York wants to know the time in London they roll the device until London appears at the top.

If its 5:57pm in New York, the number below London is 10, while the minute hand will remain on 57.

This means its 10.57pm in London.

The World Clock doesn’t account for changes in summer time, in the U.S. and UK, however. 

The World Clock is available in three colours; blue (pictured left), grey (pictured centre), and orange (pictured right). It costs £27.99 in the UK and $49.99 in the U.S
