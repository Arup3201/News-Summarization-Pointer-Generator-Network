Footage: The unnamed flight attendant contacted German newspaper Der Spiegel about footage shot of his girlfriend at the spot of Schumacher's crash (pictured)

Racing driver Michael Schumacher was skiing at just 12mph when he was thrown into the air and hit his head on a rock, according to a tourist who filmed the accident.

A German man who was filming his girlfriend in the ski resort of Meribel has come forward to say the footage includes the moment Michael Schumacher crashed on the slopes.

Detectives in France were last night trying to get a copy of the smartphone video after the man, who has not been named, went to German news journal Der Spiegel.

Formula One legend Schumacher, 45, who is still in a critical condition in an induced coma, was apparently skiing at just 12mph when he hit a rock under the snow.

Der Spiegel said: ‘The man, a 35-year-old flight attendant from Essen, was just a few metres from the accident site on the slopes and was filming his girlfriend.

‘In the background of the film, slightly blurred, a skier can be seen in the unprepared part between the two slopes sliding over the snow.

‘According to the man, who contacted Der Spiegel on Friday, the skier was Schumacher. He is believed to have slowed down to a speed of up to 20kph.’

Police will tomorrow check footage from a tiny digital camera Schumacher wore on his helmet, after his family handed it over.

The statement corroborates claims made by Schumacher’s spokeswoman Sabine Kehm.

Earlier this week she denied Schumacher had been speeding after allegations were made that he was doing at least 60km/h.

She said: 'I think after having spoken with several people who have been with Michael at this moment, Michael and the group have been skiing on slopes that were normal slopes.

'Then there is a blue slope and a red slope, and in between there was a part which was deep snow, and Michael went into that.

'From everything the people told me, he was not even at high speed, because it seems that he even helped a friend who just had fallen on the piste.

'So he started to ski again, went into this deep snow, and apparently, this is what we guess, has hit a rock which he had not seen when he wanted to do a curve, and he was kind of catapulted into the air and apparently, head down, hitting another rock.

'Which was extreme bad and unfortunate circumstance, and not because he was speeding too much. I have spoken with several people, and also ski teachers, and they tell me it can even happen at 10km/h. It is just very, very unfortunate.'

Schumacher has been in a critical condition in intensive care since his accident in the French ski resort of Meribel a week last Sunday.

His family has handed police the GoPro camera he wore on his skiing helmet at the time of his accident.

This week it will be scrutinized by N-Tec, a research division within the police at Albertville that specialises in new technology.

Schumacher’s family has kept a bedside vigil at Grenoble University Hospital.

His wife Corinna, 44, and the couple’s children Gina-Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, together with his father Rolf and brother Ralf have spent long hours at his bedside in intensive care.

Schumacher had a haematoma removed from the outside of his brain shortly after being airlifted to hospital last Sunday.

The following day he had a two-hour operation to remove the largest haematoma within his brain and further reduce the pressure.

Doctors said despite a scan showing 'a slight improvement', which enabled them to operate on Monday, the situation was critical and he has 'lesions all over the brain' and 'haematomas in the brain itself - left, right and central'.
