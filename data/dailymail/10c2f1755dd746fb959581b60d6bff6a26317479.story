There can only be one person in New York who would use Hurricane Sandy to garner yet more publicity for himself – and that is Donald Trump.

The billionaire real estate mogul, 66, launched into a self-serving attack on President Obama just hours after the devastating storm hit the East Coast.

And as the city struggled to recover from a blackout, Trump, 66, lashed out as he accused the President of using Sandy to win votes for next week’s election.

He tweeted: ‘Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President - don't fall for it.

'Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.’

After offering $5 million to charity in a bid to get President Obama to produce his college records and passport application in a desperate publicity stunt, Trump today said he was extending the deadline until midday on Thursday due to the hurricane.

He tweeted: 'Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes.

‘Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states,’ adding: ‘Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes - need I say more.’

Scathing: Trump claimed Hurricane Sandy would be 'good luck' for President Obama

Online abuse: The barrage of anti Obama tweets have left a sour taste in some people's mouths. Even Trump¿s good friend Barbara Walters has made a plea for him to stop

Trump also boasted that Trump Tower on 5th Avenue in Manhattan had stayed open last night during the storm, saying: ‘We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium - they are seeking refuge. Free coffee and food.

And posting a picture on Facebook, he wrote: ‘People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium - unlike others, I stayed open.

'He then boasted: 'The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place & kept thousands of people warm & safe during the storm--thanks, staff'

As a broken crane continues to dangle 90 stories above a luxury building on West 57th street, Trump even found time to gripe: ‘I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, I would have been lambasted from coast to coast.’

Even Trump’s good friend Barbara Walters has made a plea for him to stop.

On The View last week, the TV veteran begged: ‘You and I have known each other for many years.

‘And you know that I am your friend, and I think you are a brilliant businessman, and you are great on television, and you have a fascinating personality. Donald, you're making a fool of yourself.

‘You're not hurting Obama. You're hurting Donald, and that hurts me because you're a decent man.

Stop it. Get off it, Donald.’

Meanwhile, President Obama last week joked that Trump’s issue with him stemmed from a childhood feud in Kenya.

Trump's outpouring was met by general disdain from New Yorkers - including by model Chrissy Teigen, the fiancee of singer John Legend.The stunning brunette tweeted today: 'Finally unfollowed donald trump. my blood pressure skyrockets when he tweets and I will not allow him to have the pleasure any longer.'

And the Trump was keen not to stop as he continued with his onslaught of tweets, writing: 'The election is trending towards @MittRomney. Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline. 

'These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history'

To add insult to injury, Trump will inflict his views on the rest of America tonight when he appears on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon.
