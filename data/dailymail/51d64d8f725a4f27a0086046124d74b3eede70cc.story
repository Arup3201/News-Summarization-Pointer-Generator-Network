More than five million people are walking around as ‘ticking time bombs’ because they have no idea they suffer from high blood pressure, warn experts.

The condition has been called the nation’s biggest ‘silent killer’ as it has no obvious signs or symptoms.

It is one of the most common causes of premature death and disability as it can lead to strokes, heart attacks, heart failure or even kidney failure.

In England, 7.6million patients have been diagnosed with high blood pressure – or hypertension – with many taking drugs to control it.

But another five million are unaware their blood pressure is too high, said Public Health England.

Professor Graham MacGregor, chairman of charity Blood Pressure UK, added: ‘There are over five million people walking around like a ticking time bomb, unaware they are at risk of a stroke or heart attack due to their blood pressure.’

Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘It produces no symptoms until it causes a heart attack or a stroke, yet it is easily detectable and easily treated.

‘Despite this, there are millions walking around with this ticking time bomb, unaware that they are at increased risk of a potentially fatal heart attack or stroke.

‘It is simply unacceptable that so many avoidable heart attacks and strokes are occurring when the solution is so simple.’

Hypertension affects more than one in four adults and accounts for 12 per cent of visits to GPs in England. Latest PHE figures put the annual cost from diseases it causes at an estimated £2.1billion.

Reducing the blood pressure of the country as a whole could save £850million in health and social care costs over ten years, it said.

If 15 per cent of those who are unaware they have the condition were diagnosed, £120million could be saved over a decade. And if 15 per cent of those currently being treated for the condition controlled it better, a further £120million could be saved.

PHE has set up the Blood Pressure System Leadership Board of public bodies, charities, such as the BHF, and other experts.

It will operate like successful initiatives in the US and Canada to encourage people to take simple steps to cut their blood pressure.

These include changing their diet to reduce salt intake, keeping a healthy weight and not drinking too much alcohol.

People at risk should monitor their blood pressure regularly and alert their doctor with any changes, said PHE. Companies are also being urged to offer high-quality testing for staff at work.

The leadership board will focus on the most deprived areas as people living there are 30 per cent more likely to have hypertension.

Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of health and well-being at PHE, said: ‘Too many people are dying prematurely from preventable conditions and high blood pressure plays a big part in this.

‘It is vital for partners to come together – from local government, to the Health Service and charities, we all have a role to play.’

Professor Huon Gray, national clinical director for heart disease for NHS England, said getting the nation’s blood pressure levels into the normal range could prevent more than half of strokes and many heart attacks.

It was essential for everyone to have regular checks and take steps such as cutting salt intake and exercising more, he added.

A high blood pressure reading exceeds 140/90 millimetres of mercury. The first figure is the systolic pressure – the ‘surge’ which occurs with each heartbeat.

The second is the diastolic reading, which measures the pressure in the ‘rest’ between heartbeats.
