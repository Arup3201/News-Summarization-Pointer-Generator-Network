Some are smiling while posing for the cameras, others are hard at work and one couple are caught in a moment of reflection.

But this amazing collection of World War Two photos from the Library of Congress is all the more impressive as they have been released in full colour.

They feature the work of Office of War Information photographers who were trying to document the industrial mobilisation of the U.S. in the early 1940s as it was entering World War Two.

Posing: M-4 tank crews of Fort Knox in Kentucky during World War Two (Alfred Palmer, June 1942)

Launch: An American pineapple grenade is ready to leave the hand of an infantryman in training at Fort Belvoir, Virginia (Between 1941 and 1945)

Their work is typically seen in black and white but it has now been released in outstanding colour, reported UPI.

The photographers must have been 
using cutting-edge equipment as they have produced exceptionally clear 
colour photos for the time.

The photos, which are attributed to Alfred Palmer, Howard R. Hollem, John Collier and Fenno Jacobs, were mostly taken in 1942.

They feature scenes at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, Fort Knox in Kentucky and the Naval Air Base in Corpus Christi, Texas.

Engineers can also been seen working
