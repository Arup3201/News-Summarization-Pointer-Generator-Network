Production of Apple's iPhone 5 may have been severely impacted after thousands of factory workers in China went on strike over working on a national holiday and increasing pressures to improve the product's quality.

Between 3,000 and 4,000 staff were involved in the strike which reportedly left multiple iPhone 5 
production lines 'in a state of 
paralysis for the entire day'.

There are fears the mass protest may have seriously impacted output at the factory, which houses multiple production lines and buildings each piecing together the latest Apple technology, which is in high demand globally following its release last month.

Foxconn, pictured during a jobs fair in in southern China earlier this year, denies that production has been affected following reports of a mass strike over iPhone 5 manufacturing conditions

According to New
York-based China Labor Watch (CLW), a workers' rights organisation, the protests began Friday lunchtime after arguments and fights broke 
out between quality control inspectors and factory workers.

The organisation reported that staff were unhappy about having to work during a national holiday. From October 1-8 is the national Golden Week holiday in China.

Manufacturer Foxconn, which operates the central China factory that produces Apple's iPhone 5, required staff in the ZhengZhou site work during this time to meet high demand for the new phone.

In addition, CLW said: 'Foxconn raised overly strict 
demands on product quality without providing worker training for the 
corresponding skills.'

'This combination of factors led to the strike,' the agency said.

CWL did point out that on Friday, since it was a national holiday in China, Foxconn paid staff three times their normal pay.

Foxconn denied that there had been any disturbance to production.

Since the launch of the new iPhone 5,
there have been numerous reports of complaints over damaged sets, which
have reportedly been scratched and dented.

In response, Foxconn imposed stricter quality control measures.

This resulted in hand-sets failing quality standards checks carried out by controllers.

CLW said factory workers started fighting with quality control staff and a number of them were badly beaten.

Refusing to put up with the conditions, thousands of quality control staff then went on strike, the agency said.

CLW Executive Director Li Qiang said: 'This strike is a result of the fact that these workers just have too much pressure.'

'Factory management turned a deaf ear to complaints about these conflicts and took no corrective measures.Â 

'The result of both of these circumstances was a widespread work stoppage on the factory floor among workers and inspectors,' CLW said.

Demand for Apple's new iPhone 5 has soared since ti was launched last month, but there have been complaints about the quality of the product
