A UKIP politician who said she wanted to send immigrants back home is set to selected to stand as an MP in a key target seat.

Victoria Ayling sparked a racism row last year after she was recorded discussing the number of foreigners entering the UK and remarking: ‘I just want to send the lot back, but I can’t say that.’

Now she has been chosen by activists to contest the seat of Great Grimsby for UKIP, which she came within 700 votes of winning as a Tory candidate in 2010.

UKIP star: Victoria Ayling, who last year faced racism storm after being caught on camera saying all immigrants in Britain should be sent back home, will stand for the party in Great Grimsby

Mrs Ayling dramatically quit the Conservatives last year, after ambushing David Cameron to say she was joining Nigel Farage’s UKIP.

She claimed she was leaving because the Tories are ‘no longer the party of aspiration’.

At the last election she stood for the Conservatives in Great Grimsby against veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell, and eroded his majority to just 714 votes. 

Mrs Ayling, who a councillor on East Lindsey District Council and Lincolnshire County Council, claims UKIP will ‘throw the kitchen sink’ at winning the marginal seat. 

In 2010, Labour won with 32.7 per cent of the vote, just ahead of the Tories on 30.5 per cent, with UKIP in fourth on 6.2 per cent. 

But an opinion poll carried out by Lord Ashcroft last month put UKIP on course to beat the Tories. 

It suggest Labour had the backing of 38 per cent of voters, UKIP 27 per cent and the Conservatives 20 per cent. 

Mr Farage claims his party is now taking votes from both Labour and the Tories, and Great Grimsby is a key target for UKIP.

Mrs Ayling will hope to benefit from local recognition after standing in the seat in 2010.

But after defecting to UKIP an astonishing video emerged in which Mrs Ayling expressed her views on immigration. 

The video was filmed by Mrs Ayling's ex-husband Rob in 2008 but she has said she stands by her comments

Mrs Ayling was recorded saying: 'I just want to send the lot back, but I can't say that

The video was shot in 2008 by her then-husband Rob, and saw her recording a series of political messages. 

In one take, she said: ‘We must basically repatriate those that shouldn’t be here. That’s not quite policy yet. 

Maybe I should soften it a bit.’ She then added: ‘OK. Send them back.’ Rob is then heard to mutter: ‘National Front.’

In the very next take, Mrs Ayling – a Lincolnshire County councillor and deputy leader of the local UKIP party – says : ‘Multiculturalism is dead, I’m allowed to say that, but maybe Britishness is waving the National Front flag a bit. 

‘We must control immigration. We cannot sustain the numbers coming in; the strains on our infrastructure are enormous. Control should be done fairly and the points system like they have in Australia and all those coming here should be encouraged to speak English so they can integrate.’

She adds: ‘I just want to send the lot back but I can’t say that.’ 

Confronted over the video in December last year, Mrs Ayling told the Mail on Sunday her comments were taken ‘out of context’ and she was only referring to illegal immigrants. he said: ‘It is nothing different from what the Home Secretary is advocating now any way. And the blackmail music is from a Monty Python sketch. I don’t think there is anything there that can be seen as offensive or politically incorrect.’ 

‘I stand by what I said: illegal immigrants should be sent back home and multiculturalism won’t work. It was a throwaway comment that has been taken out of context.’ 

Speaking after her selection this week, she repeated her warnings about immigration. ‘Immigration is not a racist issue, it's about sheer numbers,’ she told the Grimsby Telegraph. 

‘This country cannot cope. It doesn't matter about country or origin, it is about uncontrolled immigration, which is putting a huge strain on our infrastructure and pushing our schools and hospitals to breaking point.’ 

Despite being backed by the local party, a UKIP spokesman said: 'All candidates must be approved by the NEC and she has not yet been approved.'
