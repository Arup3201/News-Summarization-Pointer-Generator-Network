After New York Congressman Michael Grimm threatened to throw NY1 reporter Michael Scotto off the Capitol balcony last night he followed up his ferocious threats with a series of insults questioning the journalist's masculinity.

This has led New York City media and gossip site Gawker to openly speculate whether the real reason former Marine and FBI agent Grimm threatened the 35-year-old political reporter was because he is gay.

Indeed, after threatening to throw Scotto off the 'f***ing balcony', Grimm seethed that he was going to break the reporter in half 'like a boy' and then proceeded to torment him by claiming 'You're not man enough.'

Insulted: NY1 reporter Michael Scotto was verbally attacked by New York Congressman Michael Grimm (seen right speaking to reporters on Wednesday) after the State of the Union on the balcony of the Capitol in an exchange which has caused some to question Grimm's motivation

Threat of violence: Grimm (right) was caught on camera telling Scotto: 'I'll break you in half. Like a boy.'

According to Gawker, who spoke to the reporter's colleagues, it is well known among his friends that he is indeed gay.

'Within the station community it’s pretty well known,' one colleague told Gawker.

The website poses the question: If Scotto didn't ask Grimm anything about his or anyone else's sexuality, then why did the congressman fire back a stream of insults aimed at questioning the reporter's masculinity.

Gawker claims that this is a 'common weapon of homophobes seeking to torment and marginalize gay men.'

Gawker makes the point that it is unclear if Grimm was aware of Scotto's sexuality at the time of their ugly spat.

However, the two men have been involved in interviews repeatedly over the years.

Apology: NY1 political reporter Michael Scotto takes a phone call from Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y., in Washington on Wednesday a day after Scotto was threatened by Grimm after President Barack Obama's State of the Union address (left) and (right) returns to work

'He and Congressman Grimm have worked together professionally for a while,' NY1’s Washington bureau chief Jennifer Babich told Gawker.

'But this is the first time Grimm has said anything like this.'

However, Scotto's friends claimed that the argument had nothing at all to do with his sexuality.

'It looked to me like old-school a**holedom that had nothing to do with Michael being gay,' argued a friend of his, who added - 'I’d be surprised if Grimm knew.'

Babich added, 'I don’t think that was a factor in the confrontation.'

Last night, Michael Grimm stormed off after NY1 reporter Michael Scotto tried to ask him about a controversy over his campaign finances - but returned to confront the TV news man.

Bully pulpit: Rep Michael Grimm, a Republican from Staten Island, was being interviewed by NY1 about the State of the Union address when he became angry with the reporter and threatened him

He squared up to Scotto and told him 'you ever do that to me again I'll throw you off this f***ing balcony' before threatening to break Scotto in half 'like a boy'.

But today Grimm said he had called Scotto to apologize and said he 'overreacted' when he threatened him with physical violence following the State of the Union address.

Scotto posted a message on Twitter Wednesday morning announcing the call, but it comes after Grimm already defended his decision to 'take him to task' after the reporter asked about an ongoing federal investigation into Grimm's campaign finances.

The incident was caught on camera, showing how Grimm cut the interview short after refusing to answer questions about the probe. 

Off-topic question: NY1 political reporter Michael Scotto attempted to question Grimm about the FBI investigation into his 2010 campaign fundraising, but the politician cut him off and refused to discuss the matter

‘I'm not speaking to you off-topic, this is only about the President,’ said an irate Grimm before stalking off.

‘So Congressman Michael Grimm does not want to talk about some of the allegations concerning his campaign finances,’ Scotto said into the camera.

That is when Grimm, 43, marched back and confronted a startled-looking Scotto.

Although the audio in the clip that captured the exchange is very low, a transcript provided by NY1
 shows that at one point Grimm said to Scott: 'Let me be clear to you, 
you ever do that to me again I'll throw you off this f***ing balcony.’

The reporter attempted to defend himself, pointing out that he simply wanted to ask ‘a valid question.’

In response, Grimm told him: 'No, no, you're not man enough, you're not man enough. I'll break you in half. Like a boy.’

In
 the wake of the incident, Grimm released an unapologetic statement 
claiming that he was ‘extremely annoyed’ because he was doing NY1 a 
favor by agreeing to do their interview first.

‘The
 reporter knew that I was in a hurry and was only there to comment on 
the State of the Union, but insisted on taking a disrespectful and cheap
 shot at the end of the interview, because I did not have time to speak 
off-topic,’ Grimm said.

Fit of rage: The 43-year-old retired Marine and former FBI agent went after Scott, threatening to throw him off the balcony

Next step: Hours after issuing a statement defending his decision to 'take him to task', Grimm called the reporter and apologized

He continued, saying: ‘I verbally 
took the reporter to task and told him off, because I expect a certain 
level of professionalism and respect, especially when I go out of my way
 to do that reporter a favor.

‘I doubt that I am the first Member of Congress to tell off a reporter, and I am sure I won’t be the last.’

He issued a second statement Wednesday morning: 'I was wrong. I shouldn’t have allowed my emotions to get the better of me and lose my cool.'

'I have apologized to Michael Scotto, which he graciously accepted, and will be scheduling a lunch soon. In the weeks and months ahead I’ll be working hard for my constituents on issues like flood insurance that is so desperately needed in my district post Sandy,' Grimm wrote.

A retired U.S. Marine and former FBI agent, Grimm was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 during the wave of Tea Party conservatism.

NY1 political director Bob Hardt demanded that Grimm issue an apology to Scott, calling his behavior 'extremely disturbing.'

Earlier this month, the FBI charged Grimm’s donor Diana Durand with exceeding the maximum allowable contribution to the Republican’s campaign by asking her friends to donate $10,000. 

Grimm, 47, has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged.

The New York Times reported that the politician has faced an investigation into allegations that he or his campaign illegally asked for contributions from foreign donors.  

This is not the Congressman's first threat of violence, as The New Yorker reported in 2011 that he got into a fight with a man at a Queens nightclub more than a decade earlier.

He allegedly said the man 'don’t know who he’s f***ing with...I’ll f***in’ make him disappear where nobody will find him'.

The confrontation continued into the club's garage, where a NYPD officer who was working at the club confronted then-FBI agent Grimm after Grimm was holding his gun and threatening the man.

'I’m gonna f***in' kill him...I’m a fucking F.B.I. agent, ain’t nobody gonna threaten me,’ Grimm reportedly said.

Grimm later denied saying those statements: 'I don’t need to speak that way. A guy with a gun who knows how to use it doesn’t need to say anything.'
