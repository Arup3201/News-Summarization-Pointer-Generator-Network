We live in an age of oversharing where people offer up all sorts of information online from what they're having for dinner to the toilet habits of their children.

But could your Facebook status be giving more away about yourself than you realise?

Researchers from Penn University studied the statuses of 75,000 people and were able to predict their age, gender and even personality type based just on the words they used.

They also discovered that the sexes live up to stereotypes - with women posting regularly about their hair, boyfriends, chocolate, and babies, while for men it was all about computer games, beards,  swearing and sport.

This cloud shows the most commonly used words by females on Facebook. Women were more likely to use adjectives, such as 'yummy' and 'wonderful', as well as more emoticons than men. They also regularly talked about their family and friends, clothes and hair

 The
 most commonly used words by women including 'shopping', 'excited', 
'love you' and the '<3' emoticon, which is used a heart.

Men 
commonly used the word 'f**k', 'f****g', 'wishes he', 'xbox' and 
'himself' and we more likely to link to content.

Teenagers used emoticons, variations of the word 'haha' and discussed school, homework and teachers more than older people. They were also more likely to use abbreviations such as 'omfg' and 'gah'.

At the older end of the scale - 30 and over - people talked more about napping, showering and wine as well work, wedding and laundry.

A word cloud that shows language used mostly by extroverts prominently featured 
words and phrases including 'party,' 'great night' and 'hit me up.

Alternatively, a 
word cloud for introverts featured references to Japanese media, such as Pokeman and anime, 'sigh' and more emoticons.

To visualise the results, researchers created word clouds summarising the language that 
predicted a certain trait, age or sex, with the size of the word relating directly to how often it was used.

For example, the most commonly used words by women included 'shopping', 'excited', 'love you' and the '<3' emoticon, which is used a heart.

While men commonly used the word 'f**k', 'f****g', 'wishes he', 'xbox' and 'himself', and were more likely to link to content.

A word cloud that shows language used mostly by extroverts prominently featured 
words and phrases including 'party,' 'great night' and 'hit me up.

Alternatively, a 
word cloud for introverts featured many references to Japanese media, such as Pokeman and anime, 'sigh' and more emoticons.

Co-author Johannes Eichstaedt said: 'It may seem obvious that a super extroverted person 
would talk a lot about parties, but taken all 
together, these word clouds provide an unprecedented window into the 
psychological world of people with a given trait.

'Many things seem 
obvious after the fact and each item makes sense, but would you have 
thought of them all, or even most of them?'

Facebook has added a feature that lets people edit their posts after they have been 
published.

The tool was previously only available on comments on posts.

This means if someone types a mistake and wants to correct it they no longer have to leave it, or delete and re-post.

To edit a status, click the arrow in the top right-hand corner of the post and click Edit. 

Type the changes and click Send again.

Any posts that are changed will be tagged with 'Edited'.

The
 tool is being rolled out to the web version of the social network site,
 but is expected to also be made available on Android and iOS apps in 
the near future. 

Neurotics were more likely to use words such as 'scared', 'depressed' 'crap' and 'lonely', while people with less neuroticism used words including 'praise', 'blessed' 'beautiful', 'success' and spoke less about sports.

'This doesn't guarantee that doing 
sports will make you less neurotic; it could be that neuroticism causes 
people to avoid sports,' said co-author professor Lyle Ungar of Computer and Information Science.

'But it does suggest that we should
 explore the possibility that neurotic individuals would become more 
emotionally stable if they played more sports.'

Open people spoke more about dreams, art, writing and the universe, whereas people who were less open on the personality questionnaire used more abbreviations and were poor spellers.

The group from the University of Pennsylvania were interested in whether analysis of the language used on Facebook could provide as much, or more, insight into someone's personality compared to traditional methods used by psychologists, such as self-reported surveys and questionnaires.

They asked 75,000 people to complete a common personality questionnaire through a Facebook app. The participants also made their Facebook status updates public for a limited time.

From a database of more than 700 
million words, phrases and topics, the researchers looked for overall linguistic patterns used by the volunteers.

They thencreated a computer algorithm that could predict the person's age and gender, as well their responses on the personality questionnaires.

The 
researchers were correct 92 per cent of the time when predicting users' 
gender based only on the language of their status updates, and they could identify a person's age within three years in more than 50 per cent of cases.

The personality predictions were 'inherently less accurate' but author H. Andrew Schwartz, a postdoctoral fellow in computer and information science and the Positive Psychology Center, claimed that they were 'nearly as good as using a person's questionnaire results from 
one day to predict their answers to the same questionnaire on another 
day.'

A word cloud for introverts featured many references to Japanese media, such as Pokeman and anime, 'google', 'sigh' and more emoticons than extroverts

'Most
 words occur rarely - any sample of writing, including Facebook status 
updates, only contains a small portion of the average vocabulary,' 
Schwartz said.

'This means that, for all but the most common words, you 
need writing samples from many people in order to make connections with 
psychological traits.

'Traditional studies have found interesting 
connections with pre-chosen categories of words such as 'positive 
emotion' or 'function words.' However, the billions of word instances 
available in social media allow us to find patterns at a much richer 
level.'

The study is part of the World Well-Being Project with members of the Computer and Information Science Department in Penn's School of Engineering and Applied Science and the Department of Psychology and its Positive Psychology Center in the School of Arts and Sciences.

It was published in the PLOS One Journal.
