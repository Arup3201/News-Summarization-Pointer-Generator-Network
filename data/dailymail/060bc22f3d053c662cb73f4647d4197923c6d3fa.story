David Cameron loves it, Dick Cheney's a fan and even Justin Bieber likes a game. Now Angry Birds, the online game played by 200 million people worldwide, has been given the royal seal of approval too.

The Duke of Cambridge has teamed up with makers Rovio Entertainment in a bid to raise awareness of the plight of the pangolin.

Pangolins - or scaly anteaters - will appear in an Angry Birds tournament over the next seven days, with William calling for more to be done to save the animals.

Important: William said he hopes that more people will become aware of the pangolin through Angry Birds

Speaking in a video message that accompanied the launch of the new-look game, William said he hoped the appearance of pangolins in Angry Birds would give a boost to efforts to stop poaching.

'The humble pangolin, a scaly anteater, is one of the most endangered animals on the planet because of poaching,' he said.

'The pangolin runs the risk of becoming extinct before most people have even heard of them.'

Pangolins are the world's only fully scaly mammal but numbers have gone into freefall in recent years, thanks in no small part to poaching.

The animals, which live mostly in China and south-east Asia, are considered a delicacy and are also in high demand for use in traditional medicine, as well as for use in home decoration.

As a result, the animals now boast the unfortunate distinction of being one of the most trafficked species in the world, with an estimated one million individuals taken from the wild in the last decade according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

So marked has the decline in their numbers become, all eight species of pangolin were added to the IUCN's 'Red List' during the summer, which means they are at imminent risk of extinction.

'All eight pangolin species are now listed as threatened with extinction, largely because they are being illegally traded to China and Vietnam,' said Professor Jonathan Baillie, Co-Chair of the IUCN SSC Pangolin Specialist Group, following the announcement in July. 

'In the 21st century we really should not be eating species to extinction – there is simply no excuse for allowing this illegal trade to continue.'

The Duke of Cambridge is president of an umbrella charity called United for Wildlife, which aims to tackle poaching, whether of pangolins or of larger animals such as rhinos and elephants. 

'As president of United for Wildlife, I am working with some of the world's largest conservation organisations to fight the illegal wildlife trade,' he added.

'This criminal trade is responsible for the illegal slaughter of tens of thousands of animals a year, famously elephant and rhino. 

'These species are being pushed to the brink of extinction due to poaching. These magnificent creatures will die out in the wild during my lifetime if we do not take notice now.'

The Duke hopes that this week's Angry Birds tournament, which follows a similar effort with the game Runescape earlier this year on behalf of rhinos, will encourage more people to get involved and spread the word about pangolins. 

'I would love your help to spread the message about this crisis. It may sound trivial set against other world problems, but it is an important part of the jigsaw - and it is one that you can do something about. 

'There is evidence that poaching funds criminal gangs, even terrorist organisations, and it deprives ancient communities of their heritage and livelihoods.

'By spreading the message about poaching, I hope you can be part of a movement that says no to poached ivory and rhino horn, and many other animal parts.'
