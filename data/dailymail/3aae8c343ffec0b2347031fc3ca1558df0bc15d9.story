Liberia's national
existence is 'seriously threatened' by the deadly Ebola virus
that is 'spreading like wild fire and devouring everything in
its path,' the country's national defence minister told the
United Nations Security Council.

'Liberia is facing a serious threat to its national
existence. The deadly Ebola virus has caused a disruption of the
normal functioning of our State,' said Liberian Minister of
National Defense Brownie Samukai.

'It is now spreading like wild fire, devouring everything in
its path. The already weak health infrastructure of the country
has been overwhelmed,' he told the 15-member council, adding
that the initial international response was 'less than robust.'

Meanwhile, it's thought that Ebola has now reached Italy, after a Nigerian woman resident there was hospitalised on Tuesday with symptoms consistent with the virus.

The woman, who had recently returned from a visit to Nigeria, has been hospitalised in Ancona and was undergoing tests in a specialist unit to establish whether she has indeed contracted it.

Liberia is worst hit by West Africa's Ebola epidemic and
will likely see thousands of new cases in coming weeks, the
World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday. More than 1,000
people have already died in Liberia.

U.N. special envoy to Liberia Karin Landgren told the
council that at least 160 Liberian health care workers had
contracted the disease and half of them had died. She described
the spread of Ebola as 'merciless' and warned that the reported
cases and deaths in Liberia 'understate Ebola's true toll.'

'The speed and scale of the loss of lives, and the economic,
social, political and security reverberations of the crisis are
affecting Liberia profoundly,' she said. 'Liberians are facing
their gravest threat since war.'

Two wars between 1989 and 2003 killed about 250,000 people
and led to a complete collapse of Liberia. It was carved up by
warlords who often used child soldiers and fought over control
of diamond and timber concessions.

U.N. peacekeepers were deployed to Liberia in 2003 and some
6,000 troops and police are currently there. The mission's
mandate is due to be renewed by the Security Council this month
and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has recommended a
straightforward extension of three months, instead of one year,
while the international community tackles Ebola.

The WHO said on Tuesday that it had recorded 4,293 cases in
five West African countries as of September 6. It said it still did
not have new figures for Liberia. The outbreak began in Guinea
and has spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal.

An Ebola outbreak said to be unrelated to the one in West
Africa has been reported in Democratic Republic of Congo, where
Ebola was first identified in 1976.

Ebola is a haemorrhagic fever spread through body fluids
such as the blood, sweat or vomit of those who are infected with
the disease. Health care workers are among the most vulnerable
to the disease. Liberia's Samukai said nine of Liberia's 15
counties are affected.

'The pandemic has mushroomed into a health emergency
exceeding the government's response,' he said. 'Liberia lacks
the infrastructure, logistical capacity, professional expertise
and financial resources to effectively address this disease.'

The worst epidemic since the disease was discovered has
killed at least 2,296 people.

'It is imperative that we as an international community get
serious about addressing the public health, humanitarian and
security effects of this outbreak,' U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations, Samantha Power, said after the briefing.

'I don't think anybody can say right now that the
international response to the Ebola outbreak is sufficient,'
said Power, who is president of the council for September.
'Every organisation and every single member state in the
international community needs to be looking at how we up our
game.'

Ban said he plans to hold a meeting on the international
response to the Ebola crisis on the sidelines of the U.N.
General Assembly later this month.
