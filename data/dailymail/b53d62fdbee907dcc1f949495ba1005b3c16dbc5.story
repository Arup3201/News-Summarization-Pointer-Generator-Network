Sony yesterday unveiled the world's first folding tablet computer, which it hopes will challenge Apple's iPad.

The £479 Sony Tablet P has two 5.5in touchscreens and can be folded in half, making it more portable than the iPad and other similar devices.

Sony says it will easily fit inside a handbag or jacket pocket. It is £20 cheaper than an iPad 2 with the same wi-fi and 3G internet access.

Looking to steal some of the iPad's thunder: Sony Tablet P was one of two new products unveiled by the global tech giant in Berlin today ahead of a Christmas sales war

The two sides of the tablet can be 
combined and used as one large screen – albeit with a potentially 
irritating hinge running through the middle.

They can also operate independently, with one running a game and one running emails, for example.

Like other tablet computers it can download music and videos and has cameras on the front and back, allowing for video calls.

Portable: The Tablet P has two 5.5-inch screens, each with a 1024 x 480 display. It will cost £479

Tablet computers are predicted to be 
the hottest Christmas must-haves this year, along with smartphones such 
as Apple’s iPhone 5, due to be unveiled this month. Details of the 
device were revealed at the IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin, 
where a host of manufacturers were revealing new or upgraded tablets.

Sony also unveiled a more conventional tablet, the Sony S.

It has a 9.4in touchscreen, and it 
comes with infrared technology, which means it can be used as a remote 
control for a TV or Blu-ray disc player. At the touch of a button, video
and photos can be transferred – or ‘thrown’ – from the tablets to 
compatible TV sets, such as Sony’s Bravia range.

The version with wi-fi access will 
cost £399, the same as a similar 16GB iPad 2. An iPad 2 with wi-fi and 
3G access costs £499. The wi-fi version will be available in the UK from
the middle of September, while the enhanced 3G version and the folding 
Sony Tablet P will go into stores in November.

The Mobile Gazette website praised the
‘innovative design’ of  the products and said: ‘These two Sony tablets 
could finally provide some serious competition to the Apple iPad 2.’

But Jeff Loff, an electronics analyst 
at Macquarie Securities, was not impressed with the new offerings, 
giving the blunt assessment: ‘We think the design will fail.’

Comfortable: The Tablet S was designed with a tapered width for carrying around 'like a magazine'

Back side: The Tablet S has 1280 x 800 screen resolution, 512MB RAM and 32GB memory
