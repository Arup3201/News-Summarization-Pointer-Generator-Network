It's a milestone in any couple's relationship: the day you take the plunge and decide to move in together.

But for this couple from Italy the game-changing moment is made all the more poignant because not only is it captured on camera, but they both have Down Syndrome and might not be expected to live independently.

'The Special Proposal' was recorded by CoorDown, Italy's national association of people with Down's, to mark World Down Syndrome Day yesterday and first published byFast Company.

Viewers watch Salvatore, who has Down Syndrome, with the key to the couple's new home in a ring box

He goes down on one knee to make his proposal in front of girlfriend Caterina who works at McDonald's

The film shows a man called Salvatore asking his girlfriend Caterina to move in with him with the help of a cappella group singing Norah Jones's romantic hit Come Away With Me.

A series of captions read: 'Rome, 27th February 2015.

'My name is Salvatore and I'm 38. I'm about to give a surprise to Caterina, my girlfriend.

'I'll ask her to finally realise our dream.' 

Salvatore surprises Caterina at McDonald's, where she works, and goes down on one knee with a box containing a key to their new home as customers look on. 

He asks her: 'Would you come live with me, my love?'

At the end of the video Salvatore is seen wiping tears of happiness from his girlfriend's face

At the end of the proposal, as Salvatore wipes tears of happiness from Caterina's cheeks, viewers are presented with the message: 'Just like Salvatore and Caterina, many couples dream of one day living together. Let's help them realise this dream.'

Down Syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs as a result of an extra chromosome. 

The condition affects around one in every 1,000 babies born in the UK, and two babies are born with the condition every day.

So far the video has clocked up more than 12,000 Facebook likes.
