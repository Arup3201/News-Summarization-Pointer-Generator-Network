Ki Sung-Yueng scored the goal that gave Swansea a first away win since the opening day of the season. But the South Korean had actually tried to get out of the way of Jonjo Shelvey’s shot, which cannoned off him into the net.

Hull can consider themselves unfortunate to have lost. They produced a spirited response to the goal with several misses and goalkeeper Lucasz Fabianski kept out the rest.

Steve Bruce’s side are without a win in their last 10 League matches and their last victory was back in October against Crystal Palace. They are far from adrift in 19th place but certainly drifting, and in danger.

Hull City fans embrace the festive spirit and dress as Father Christmas to watch the match against Swansea on Saturday afternoon

 ‘There’s still a long way to go and we have games coming up against some of the teams around us,’ said Bruce. ‘You can’t feel sorry for yourself in this League. It’s unforgiving and you have to get on with it.

‘We’ve had an awful run and when you have a bad run, confidence plays a part. You need your big players to perform and what’s disappointing is too many players are not performing anywhere near the level they need to be.’

Bruce also bemoaned the fact that key players have been missing. On Saturday they included the injured Michael Dawson and Mohamed Diame, while Tom Huddlestone was suspended.

Swansea manager Garry Monk praised his team’s ‘committment and effort’ and said: ‘We deserved to win.’

He made seven changes to the team which lost at home to Tottenham last week and knew he risked criticism if such wholesale alterations backfired, especially as he dropped Ivory Coast striker Wilfried Bony to the bench.

‘I trust the squad and that’s what it’s there for,’ he said, adding that the crowded fixture list and Bony’s upcoming absence at the Africa Cup of Nations was on his mind. Hence an opportunity for Bafi Gomis.

Monk will also be missing Ki in January as he captains South Korea at the Asian Cup.

Monk lauded his ‘fantastic’ contribution and said ‘He is a big player for us.’ He also added, with a smile, that Ki and Shelvey were both claiming the goal.

The teams traded early misses in a franctic start, Nikica Jelavic’s fluffed shot from the left the first and worst of the bunch in the fourth minute. Wayne Routledge shot wide at the other end, followed by Gaston Ramirez. who was set up by Abel Hernandez.

Swansea went ahead in the 15th minute when Ki and Shelvey were given too much space to exchange passes and Ki was allowed to run into the penalty area unmarked.

Shelvey’s shot from 25 yards did not look dangerous until it hit Ki’s arm as he tried to move out of the way and the ball took a sharp change of direction away from Allan McGregor and into the net.

Hull chased the game, with Andy Robertson hitting the woodwork.

Swansea had the best chance to score again when Tom Carroll set up Shelvey but Fabianski saved. Gomis also hit a post.
