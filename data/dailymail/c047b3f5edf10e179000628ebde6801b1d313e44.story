The 26-year-old ensures she is involved in every process of her range, from selecting the fabrics and prints to modelling and promoting it.

In a behind-the-scenes video, Rosie can be seen strutting across the room in a sexy lace underwear set with suspenders as she playfully pulls her hair into a bun.

In another shot, the Transformers actress, whose range for M&S is the best-selling of all time, wears a sheer silk chiffon baby doll top and shorts as she pouts at the camera.

Speaking about her passion for lingerie to The Coveteur last month, the designer said: 'I have used vintage slips and gowns a lot to influence my designs for Rosie for Autograph.

'There’s nothing sexier than confidence, so I think it's important to find lingerie that make you feel the best you can feel. Maybe it’s a bra and suspenders, maybe it’s a silky slip and robe.

'Put a dab of your favorite fragrance on, light a few candles and have fun!'.

Model behaviour: From print inspiration to modelling the range, Rosie ensures that she is involved in every step

Inspired: Rosie, who chooses the prints and styles herself, says she often gets inspired by random posts on Instagram

The model - who describes her range as 'her baby' - explained that she finds inspiration on her travels, in flea markets and even when she's 'killing time' scrolling through Instagram.

Aside from her Rosie For Autograph 
lingerie line for the British store, Rosie is 
set to star in Mad Max: Fury Road, alongside Tom Hardy and Nicholas 
Hoult.

The sci-fi action adventure movie is a
 sequel to the films that kick-started Mel Gibson's career and it is
 currently in post-production.

In 2011 Rosie replaced Megan Fox in Transformers: Dark of The Moon, her first movie role.

Her relationship with actor Jason Statham seems to be going from strength to strength and the couple seem happier than ever.

M&S for over a year now and her lingerie collection is their most 
popular ever

Solid couple: Rosie and Jason have been dating for three years now and seem more in love than ever
