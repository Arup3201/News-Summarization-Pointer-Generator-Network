The 18-month-old mini lion has taken on the personality of the much larger predator after her owners were forced to shave her.

The long-tail Persian has ended up with an impressive as a result of a grooming problem and the vet’s scissors.

Queen of the jungle: Daily the Persian has been turned into a little lion - and it has even affected her personality

According to her owners, since being shaved by the vet to rid her of her tangled hair, Daisy has even started to take on the personality of a young lion - by pouncing on human visitors as well as fellow cats.

Australian owner, Ben Torode, 36, lives in Tokyo, Japan with his wife Miki, 32.

Ben, who works as a translator, explained the story behind Daisy's transformation from a typical Persian cat to one that is more on the wild side.

‘Daisy really embraced her look after a few days,’ said Ben. ‘The lion cut has rekindled the popularity of her kitten days.'

Personality change: Since her shave, Daisy has gone from timid house cat to feral beast - at least when it comes to toys and feet

Her favourite attack is to get low down and pounce at toys - and feet - from cover, after a wiggle of her tail to mentally prepare.

‘We think she's picked up a little lion DNA somewhere along the way.’

‘It's been a couple of months now and her hair is growing back steadily. Another few months and she'll be back to normal and ready for winter.’ 

Back in the day: In her kitten months, Daisy became an online celebrity thanks to her owner's videos
