He might be about to become a father for a second time but it seems that the Duke of Cambridge already has his hands full with Prince George.

Handed a bag of Christmas bells by nine-year-old Dylan Marten Hughes during an event  last night, the Duke joked that he knew 'just what to do' with them and went on to tell the delighted children of his plans to use them as a means of keeping track of his son.

'I'll probably put them in his pocket, we'll know where he is then,' the Duke added.

Christmas bells? We need those for Prince George, revealed the Duke of Cambridge during a gala last night

Prince William met the children during a visit to the Imperial War Museum, where he attended a gala dinner on behalf of SkillForce, a charity that matches troubled children with mentors drawn from the armed forces.

William was without his wife for the event, who earlier the same day had visited the GSK Human Performance Lab in Brentford on behalf of charity, SportsAid.

The Duchess of Cambridge, 32, is thought to be around 16 weeks pregnant, although barely a hint of a baby bump could be seen under her plum dress by British label, Goat.

During a speech at the dinner, the Duke, 32, said that remembrance 'must never become the preserve or responsibility of one generation' and called on young people to show their support.

'I was privileged to be able to visit the poppy installation at the Tower of London in its early days,' he continued.

Keeping track: According to a proud Duke of Cambridge, George is keeping his parents on their toes

Support: The Duke meets SkillForce ambassador Kate Adie during a gala dinner at the Imperial War Museum

Patron: The Duke has been involved with SkillForce, which mentors troubled children, since 2009

On his own: The Duke of Cambridge was without his wife for the Imperial War Museum event

'Even then, before it was as famous as it is now, the people observing the poppies came from every generation.

'The young there were just as moved as the old. Their grief and thanksgiving for the sacrifice of previous generations was just as real.'

He was speaking three days after joining the Queen to lay wreaths of poppies at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall to commemorate those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.

The Duke has been patron of SkillForce since 2009 and joined the charity to celebrate the launch of the Junior Prince's Award - a programme that aims to help children prepare for secondary school via 'character-building' activities and projects.

Important: During a speech, William called on the young to do their bit to remember Britain's war dead

Honour: On Sunday, the Duke joined Prince Edward and the Duke of Edinburgh at the Cenotaph

Remembrance: The service was led by the Queen and also saw Prince Charles lay a wreath

Mr Marten Hughes, from Watford, was among a group of children invited to meet the Prince at the Imperial War Museum, along with Thomas Brooker and Ellis Knight, both 10.

Their Remembrance Day project, a figure laden with red poppies, each of which represented a fallen soldier, certainly met with William's approval. 

'It was clear that they, like those children who gather at the Tower of London or at Remembrance Day parades, are grasping something that will instil hopefulness and commitment about a better future in themselves and in their generation,' he said afterwards.

'This is no small achievement. Only by pointing to all that remembrance means can we have any chance of making our society a better place and giving these young people hope, which is the fuel for all the work they will need to do to fulfil their potential.'
