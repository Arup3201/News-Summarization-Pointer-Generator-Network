Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger's job as a World Cup pundit gives him plenty of opportunity to check out his top transfer targets.

Working for French television as a commentator, the Gunners boss is also in the enviable position of being able to scout for reinforcements for the next Premier League season.

Here are five players he could be keeping an eye on during the tournament.

Scouting mission: Arsene Wenger is able to keep an eye on his top club targets

Outstanding: Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina

Top stopper: David Ospina currently plays for French side Nice

DAVID OSPINA 

Colombia goalkeeper plays for Nice in France and would represent a relative bargain compared to other targets David Marshall of Cardiff, John Ruddy of Norwich and Pepe Reina at Liverpool but lack of Premier League experience may count against him.

Chance of signing: 2/5

Wing wizard: Antoine Griezmann in action in France's opening World Cup fixture

Real Sociedad star: Antoine Griezmann battles for the ball in La Liga match

ANTOINE GRIEZMANN

Excellent winger was recommended by Damien Comolli and well liked at Liverpool but more ominously Real Madrid. Arsenal are talking to Real Sociedad about Carlos Vela and right-back Joseba Zaldua but may not be able to compete with Madrid's finances.

Chance of signing: 2/5

Top of Wenger's shopping list: Croatian and Bayern Munich forward Mario Mandzukic, left

Star striker: Mario Mandzukic has scored plenty of goals for Bayern Munich

MARIO MANDZUKIC

Croatia striker is leaving Bayern and they will sell, Arsenal have made a lot of enquiries about him but again there is competition from Manchester United, Chelsea and clubs in Italy and Spain. Mandzukic is keen on Arsenal but would want to play ahead of Giroud.

Chance of signing: 3/5

Top striker: Karim Benzema has been a target of Wenger's for a while and has been in great form for France so far

In action for Real Madrid: French forward Karim Benzema

KARIM BENZEMA

Real Madrid were ready to sell Benzema before the Champions League final but Carlo Ancelotti wants him to stay. The France striker wants a pay rise and that could lead to a stand-off with Madrid hierarchy keen on Luis Suarez. Arsenal see too many complications.

Chance of signing: 1/5

Keen to join Arsenal: Serge Aurier, left, has already spoken of his desire to join the Gunners

On the move?: Serge Aurier fancies a move away from French side Toulouse

SERGE AURIER

Ivory Coast right-back was excellent against Japan, setting up two goals. However, defensive frailties may prevent Arsenal from paying the asking price of £7m. Other clubs are keen and Arsenal are looking at alternatives such as Japan's Atsuto Uchida and Zaldua.

Chance of signing: 3/5
