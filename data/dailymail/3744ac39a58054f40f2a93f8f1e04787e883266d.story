The evening of 11-year-old Luke Batty's murder remains very clear in the memory of mother Rosie Batty.Â 

She recalled the moment her ex-partner Greg Anderson turned up with a 'big smile' at his son's cricket practice in Tyabb, south of Melbourne, on February 12 but soon after she heard a 'very disturbing sound'.

'I ran towards the sound because I didn't understand what it was and I could see Greg kneeling beside Luke and I thought, oh my God, he's done a fast bowl to his head and he's knocked him out and he's really hurt him,' she told the ABC program Four Corners.

But it was just before Anderson resisted arrest by police that cricket coach Cameron Colvin, who initially thought the horrific attack was an accident, spoke with Luke's father.

'I asked Greg, how's he doing? And that's when he said, "yeah, he's okay, he's fine, he's in heaven now".'

That night Anderson murdered his 11-year-old son at a cricket pitch. Anderson was shot by police at the scene and later died.

Ms Batty said she found it 'gravely concerning' that police didn't tell her about frightening death threats made by his Luke's father just weeks before he killed their son.

Anderson had threatened to kill one of his housemates - asking him if he wanted to die, before suggesting he would cut his head off.

The house mate was granted an intervention order and police arrested Anderson.

While police contacted Luke's mother about a week before Luke was murdered and asked her if she knew where Anderson was living, she says they failed to tell her about the death threat or a separate intervention order against him.

'You can't help but think that some intervention may have just been enough for him to rethink or maybe enough of a red flag for me to understand what acute danger Luke and I were in,' she said.

At this stage, Anderson was only allowed to see Luke in public when he was playing sport after Ms Batty was informed he had been caught viewing child pornography images.

'For some reasons I thought he was safer in an open space with people around,' Ms Batty said.

Victoria Police Commissioner Ken Lay said stringent privacy laws limited the amount of information available to potential victims.

'From a victim's perspective, I suspect you'd be very angry if you weren't privy to that sort of information,' he said.

However, he said the pending coroner's inquest into Luke's death limited what he could say about his feelings on the issue.

'I hope to be in a position, once the coroner comes back, to be making some public comments about these issues which might better reflect my views on things.'
