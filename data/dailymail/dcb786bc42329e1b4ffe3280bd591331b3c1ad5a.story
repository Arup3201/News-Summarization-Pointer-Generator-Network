Everton have agreed a new five-year contract with England defender John Stones worth around £30,000 a week.

The 20-year-old, who was on the stand-by list for England’s World Cup squad, has been a target for Chelsea, who were willing to offer £15million for the promising centre-back.

Stones, who was signed from Barnsley by previous manager David Moyes, is now tied to Goodison Park until 2019. However, he and Ross Barkley remain on Chelsea’s radar.

Stones said: ‘It’s just been such a great last season and to get pen to paper on a new deal is a dream come true.

‘The last 12 months have been so enjoyable thanks to the faith that the manager has shown in me and all the players. It was a very memorable season and hopefully there’s more to come.’

Steven Pienaar has been full of praise for Stones, who he says will be a key cog for England in the coming years.

'Stonesy is totally different compared to other English central defenders. He's more of a ball player who is really comfortable in possession,' Pienaar said. 

'It suits the manager and it's good for the team. I can understand why England put their hopes on him. He's certainly got a bright future and he's got a good head on his shoulders. 

'I hope to see many more years of him playing at the top level for Everton and his country.'
