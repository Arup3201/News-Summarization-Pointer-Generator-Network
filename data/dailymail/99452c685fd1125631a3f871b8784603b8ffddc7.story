Roman Suru, 40, from West Bromwich, allegedly staged a sham gay wedding to help an illegal immigrant secure UK citizenship 

Two migrants plotted a sham gay marriage at Gretna Green while one of them was living with a woman, a court heard.

Father-of-two Ramon Suru, 40, from Slovakia, is accused of setting up the bogus ceremony with Gurmail Joshan after meeting the Indian national in a pub.

A court heard the two men became friends and hatched the plot because Joshan had been in the UK illegally after overstaying a student visa.

Divorced Suru had even arranged for the girlfriend he was living with, fellow Slovak Marianna Bartkova, 40, to attend the fake ceremony as a witness.

But the marriage was halted when immigration and police officers swooped on Gretna Green Register Office in June last year as the men prepared to tie the knot, prosecutor Elisabeth Bussey-Jones said.

The police had been alerted after a registrar had raised ‘question marks’ about the legitimacy of the relationship when the pair submitted details of the planned ceremony, the jury was told. 

Suru and Bartkova - who were living together at the time - have now gone on trial accused of conspiring with Joshan to facilitate a breach in immigration law. 

The court heard Joshan and Suru began hatching the plan after meeting at The Goose pub in West Bromwich, West Midlands, in November 2012.

Joshan had already booked three different services at West Bromwich Register Office between January and April last year - but never turned up.  

Elisabeth Bussey-Jones, prosecuting, said the sham marriage was stopped  as the men prepared to tie the knot.

She said: 'The registrar had raised question marks about the legitimacy of the relationship when the pair officially registered details of the planned ceremony.' 

She added: 'Illegal immigrants can apply to stay as a citizen of the UK if they marry nationals from EU countries, such as Slovakia, who are living here.' Jurors have not yet been told from where Joshan hails.

Detective Sergeant Andy Carter, who was involved in the swoop in Gretna Green, gave evidence on the first day of the trial.

He said the two men, Bartkova and another Czech woman - who was also expected to be a witness of the ceremony - had travelled from the West Midlands to Scotland in a black Audi A6 for the planned civil ceremony.

The plan was foiled when by immigration and police officers, after the registrar at the registry officer in Gretna Green raised concerns about the legitimacy of the relationship, Wolverhampton Crown Court

Suru and Bartkova, from West Bromwich, deny the charge, which is alleged to have occurred between November 9, 2012 and June 29, 2013. The trial continues at Wolverhampton Crown Court (pictured)

The officer said Bartkova was found in possession of an envelope containing £1,000, along with a debit card of Joshan's.

A non-British person who marries someone either from the UK, or someone who is exercising 'free movement rights' in the UK from a European Economic Area (EEA) member state, can stay in the UK for up to five years.

After that, the spouse or civil partner may be eligible to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK.

Under Brussels rules, they can then apply for permission to bring in their extended family.   

The court heard Suru had arrived in Britain ten years ago.

After splitting from his wife, he set up home in August 2012 with fellow Slovakian Bartkova, also a divorcee, in a one bedroom flat.

The court was also told Bartkova had described Suru as her partner in unrelated dealings with the police. She later insisted that they slept separately and were just friends.

Suru and Bartkova, from West Bromwich, deny the charge, which is alleged to have occurred between November 9, 2012 and June 29, 2013.

The trial is being heard in Bartkova's absence. 

Joshan, also from West Bromwich, has already admitted conspiring to facilitate a breach in immigration law.   

The trial  continues.
