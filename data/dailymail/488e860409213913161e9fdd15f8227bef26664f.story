Party: Jabbar Cambell, 32, claims a group of NYPD officers assaulted him after responding to a noise complaint about a gay pride party in his Brooklyn apartment

A Brooklyn man claims he was brutally beaten by a group of nine 'homophobic' police officers responding to a noise complaint at his gay pride party.

Jabbar Cambell, 32, claims the NYPD officers burst into his eight-bedroom flat yelling 'fag' and 'f***ing homo', in what his lawyer has described as a 'hate crime'.

Mr Cambell, a computer forensics investigator, is also claiming that the police tried to 'conceal evidence' by tampering with a video camera outside his property before they entered.

After being left with a bloodied mouth and black eye, and having spent 24 hours in custody following the incident, Mr Campbell has now issued legal papers indicating he intends to sue the police.

Recalling the incident, he said: 'They were yelling ‘you f***ing fag’ and
‘homo'.'

'I couldn’t block the 
blows. I was fighting to stay conscious [but] I was blacking out because
of the hits I was taking.'

The alleged beating followed a call to police about excessive noise at Mr Cambell’s apartment on 
Sterling Place in Crown Heights, where around 80 revelers had gathered.

Two officers first arrived at the property at approximately 2:50 am where they told partygoers - some dressed in drag - to quieten down.

After leaving, it is alleged another group of officers arrived 10 minutes later.

The officers buzzed at the locked door — and one even reached out to disable the surveillance camera in the vestibule.

Cambell claims he observed the police arriving through a surveillance camera, before he noticed a police officer disabling the camera.

Belligerent: A police report claims Mr Cambell ignored their demands to 'discontinue a party' and then pushed an officer, before attempting to flee and acting 'belligerently¿

He has provided a videotape that appears to show three officers standing outside the property before one of them reaches towards the camera.

'I noticed them turning the security camera and I got scared,' Mr Cambell told the New York Post.

After ten minutes, Mr Cambell says he went to the door to let the officers in to the apartment, which takes up the entire second floor of the two-story building.

He said: 'I opened the door and one officer 
used his foot and arm to hold the door open. There was a
sergeant, he yelled ‘get him!’ and that’s when I got attacked.

'They kept saying ‘Stop 
resisting’ but I wasn’t resisting. I didn’t have any time to respond.'

Police claim Mr Cambell ignored their demands to 'discontinue a party' 
and then pushed an officer, before attempting to flee and acting 'belligerently’.

Hotels are a particular concern. Police have worked closely with managers, urging them to guard against anyone who might seek to check into a guest room and use it to launch a sniper or other type of attack

Mr Cambell was later charged with resisting arrest, attempted assault and possession of marijuana.

The alleged victim claims two officers held his
arms while another pushed his head forward, before a fourth officer repeatedly punched his face.

He was later taken to Kings County Hospital for treatment before being held in custody for 24 hours.

Mr Cambell claims he was paid $300 by a party planner to
host the gay pride party at his property, with guests paying a $5 entrance fee.

His lawyer, Herb Subin, said the accused the police of 'screaming anti-gay epithets', describing the incident as a 'hate crime'.
