Ron Vlaar has been ruled out for up to six weeks through a knee injury to effectively end any chance the Dutch international might move clubs this transfer window.

The Aston Villa captain had surgery on Wednesday and could miss as many as seven games as he recovers.

Vlaar has struggled with injuries this season, mainly through problems with his calf, and came back from the World Cup with Holland nursing a knee complaint.

Vlaar impressed during the World Cup after a string of good performances for Louis van Gaal's Holland

Louis Van Gaal had looked to bring him to Manchester United this January but any potential move is now likelier in the summer, when Vlaar’s contract expires. 

The 29-year-old was forced off early in the recent match against Crystal Palace and has not trained since.

Villa manager Paul Lambert said: 'It’s just a little meniscus thing and It looks like he will be out for between four and six weeks. Hopefully it’s not too bad. It’s certainly not as bad as it could have been.

'Even if he wasn’t injured I was confident (of keeping him this window). Our aim is to get him back fit now'
