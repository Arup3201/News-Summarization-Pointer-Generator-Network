Florida criminals could soon have their handcuffs secured by a hand with four NBA championship rings.

Retired NBA star Shaquille O'Neal has applied to be a reserve police officer for Doral, about 13 miles from Miami.

To wear the badge he'll have to pass a Florida's officer-certification exam and pass a background check.

Time reports that the exams will measure the 7-foot-1 Center's physical and psychological fitness.

Should he be accepted, reserve officer will be that latest entry on an resume that has become increasingly eclectic since O'Neal Rookie of the Year winning NBA season in 1993.

He's also dabbled in acting, rap, sports analysis, video games, and reality television.

O'Neal's fame won't give him any added advantage pursuing law enforcement.

He'll 'have to do everything else to be certified by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, just like any of our other officers, reserve or not reserve,' said city spokesman Christina Baguer.

It seems unlikely the tests will be an issue for the 42-year-old who has already passed a similar exam while applying to be a reserve police officer in Miami Beach.

In that 2004 application, he listed special skills as 'laptop computer, binnochulars, master of surveillance,' as quoted by The Miami New Times, who replicated the former Laker's spelling errors.

As for fitness, he once told The New York Times, 'I don't need to work out.'
