If you're worried about what your lifestyle may be doing to your health, then a new - albeit very morbid gadget - gadget claims to help.

A Swedish inventor has designed a watch that apparently calculates a person's life expectancy - and even counts down to the time they will die. 

Dubbed the 'death watch', Tikker was created by Fredrik Colting.

Dubbed the 'death watch', the Tikker apparently calculates a person's life expectancy - and even counts down to the time they will die. The top row of the watch's digital display shows years, months and days, while the second row counts down hours, minutes and seconds.The bottom row shows the local time

But far from being morbid, Mr Colting calls it 'The Happiness Watch' and claims it has been designed to help people make the most of their life and cherish the time they have left.

To set up Tikker, the wearer fills out a questionnaire by entering information about their medical history, including allergies or illnesses.

They are also asked whether they drink or smoke and if there are any instances of cancer, diabetes and other diseases in their family.

Wearers are additionally asked about how much exercise they do, as well as how much they weigh before receiving a score.

Their age is deducted from the results to predict a death date and the Tikker - which also works as a regular watch - begins the countdown. 

Now, after a crowdfunding campaign, the gadget is available to buy online £49.99. 

Despite the original target being $25,000, a total of $98,665 was eventually raised.  

'Imagine someone told you that you only had one year left to live. How would that change your life? 

Far from being morbid, Tikker's Swedish inventor, Frank Colting, calls it 'The Happiness Watch' and claims it has been designed to help people make the most of their life and cherish the time they have left

'For all of us, life comes with a best-before date,' said Mr Colting, who came up with the idea when his grandfather passed away.

'While death is non-negotiable, life isn't. All we have to do is learn how to cherish the time and the life that we have been given; seize the day and follow our hearts.'

'From years to seconds it presents time ever moving, never standing still, and our lives dwindling

towards the final rest,' said Cotling.

'The occurrence of death is no surprise to anyone, but in our modern society we rarely talk about it. 

'I think that if we were more aware of our own expiration I'm sure we'd make better choices while we are alive.' 

Sarah Kabunga, buyer at Firebox.com, said: 'We all know that time waits for no man.

'The Death Watch lets you know down to the last second exactly how not to waste it by simply completing a questionnaire based on your general health and lifestyle.'
