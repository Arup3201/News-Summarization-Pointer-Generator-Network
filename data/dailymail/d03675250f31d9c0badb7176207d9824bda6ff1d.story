It appears that when it comes to lunch on the hoof us Brits are looking for something a little more exotic than a supermarket meal deal.

It has been revealed by Allegra Foodservice that half the country are buying street food at least once a week as becomes the country's biggest culinary trend.

One in five of us are making it a regular habit and are visiting our favourite food truck up to three times in one week.

Street food is increasing in popularity as office workers search for something more exciting than a meal deal

Jaded by cheese sandwiches and Cornish pasties it appears we're after something with a bit more flavour, with the top-selling foods being Mexican, Chinese and Thai followed by Indian, British and Italian.

Rather than opting for a bargain hot dog from a greasy food van we are prepared to fork out a fair bit for a tastier lunch, with 64 per cent of punters willing to pay more than a fiver a pop on fresh wraps, noodles or rice.

The trend for on-the-go cuisine is particularly popular in areas with high concentrations of office workers where street stalls and mobile food centres are popping up.

Our favourite food on-the-go is Mexican and we are willing to pay more than £5 a pop for it!

Allegra strategy director Simon Stenning, told trade journal Morning Advertiser that it was the tasty yet affordable approach that was gaining street food its popularity.

'The economy is getting better but we still don't have more money in our pockets so people are willing to spend more bur for great value, which is what street food is perceived as.'

Richard Johnson, founder of British Street Food said that it gives us something to look forward to in the office.

'Our lives have become very internal and when we do break away from our laptops, phones and tablets we want an authentic community experience.'
