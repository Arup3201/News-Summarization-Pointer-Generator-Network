Bashar al-Assad's regime could 'take credit' for its swift action in agreeing to destroy its arsenal of chemical weapons, according to a leading U.S. diplomat.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the process had begun in 'record time' as it was revealed UN weapons inspectors had begun destroying Syria’s chemical weapons capability within a week of arriving in the war-torn country.

The team – which includes staff from 
the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons – 
left Damascus on Saturday for an unknown location to supervise the start 
of the 
process after an agreement was reached last week.

It
 is believed they are using crude but effective methods in an effort to 
achieve the first part of the task as quickly as possible.

'I think it's extremely significant 
that yesterday, Sunday, within a week of the (UN) resolution being 
passed, some chemical weapons were being destroyed,' John Kerry, quoted 
in Yahoo News, told reporters alongside Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after talks in Indonesia.

'I think it's a credit to the Assad regime, frankly. It's a good beginning and we welcome a good beginning.'

Their mission comes in response to the August 21 chemical attack in Damascus and is expected to last into the middle of next year.

A member of the team said: ‘Missile warheads, aerial bombs and mobile and static mixing and filling units were destroyed and disabled in a number of different ways, including with cutting torches.

‘The plan is to do more such destruction and disabling in the coming days.’

The
 actual chemicals are likely to be dealt with in November. A system 
developed by the Pentagon converts dangerous compounds into substances 
that cannot be used for military purposes.

The dismantling team, which includes 
staff from the UN and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical 
Weapons (OPCW), arrived in Damascus on Tuesday.

They have about nine months to purge 
President Bashar Assad's regime of its chemical programme.

The mission, 
endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, faces the tightest deadline in 
the watchdog group's history and must simultaneously navigate Syria's 
bloody civil war.

Syrians will be responsible for the 
actual physical demolition of the materials, while UN inspectors monitor
 the process and verify what is being destroyed.

This
 is just the beginning of a complicated process to eliminate Syria's 
estimated 1,000-ton chemical weapons stockpile and the facilities that 
created it.

Damascus 
developed its chemical program in the 1980s and 1990s, building an 
arsenal that is believed to contain mustard gas and the nerve agents 
sarin VX and tabun.

The production and storage facilities are understood to be scattered around the country.

Members
 of the team are planning visits to every location where chemicals or 
weapons are stored - from trucks loaded with munitions up to full-on 
production sites.

Their role, which Washington and Moscow spent weeks hammering out after an August 21 attack in Damascus prompted U.S. threats of air strikes, is expected to continue until at least mid-2014.

In an interview in a state-run newspaper Sunday, Assad said the Syrian regime began producing chemical weapons in the 1980s to 'fill the technical gap in the traditional weapons between Syria and Israel.'

He said production of chemical weapons was halted in the late 1990s but was otherwise tight-lipped about the armaments.
