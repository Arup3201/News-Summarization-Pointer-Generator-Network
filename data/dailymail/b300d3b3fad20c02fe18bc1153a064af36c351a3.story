A serial killer who lured his victims with the promise of cheap designer jeans has confessed to a third murder after more than 30 years.

Jesus Aguilero, who arrived in the United States on the 1980 Mariel boatlift from Cuba went on a killing spree in the Bronx, New York, in 1981, murdering Guillermo Graniela, 30, and Josefina Cepeda, 24.

The 61-year-old, who is behind bars for the slayings, has now pleaded guilty to killing 35-year-old mother Tolila Brown in the same year. 

Confession: Jesus Aguilero, 61, who arrived in the United States on the 1980 Mariel boatlift from Cuba, has admitted killing 35-year-old Tolila Brown in 1981. He is already behind bars for two separate murders 

The 35-year-old prostitute was strangled and left to die in a shack in Minford Place. 

He initially denied being behind the murder, but according to The New York Post he changed his mind because horrific details of the other deaths would have been discussed and may have sealed his fate. 

The Post reported that Aguilero’s DNA was drawn in 2001 while he was serving a 45-year-to-life sentence for those murders.

Then in 2009, NYPD detective Malcolm Reiman linked him to the murder with fingerprints and DNA evidence at the scene.

In June, the lab discovered it matched DNA found under Moore’s fingernails.

He is the prime suspect in two other, unsolved murders including the death of Janet Agosto, 20, in 1982.

Aguilero is up for parole in 2026, however his defense lawyer Javier Solano believes there is 'no way on Earth' he would be released.
