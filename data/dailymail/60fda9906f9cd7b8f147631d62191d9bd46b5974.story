This is the moment a four-year-old girl is caught red-faced - literally - after delving into her mother's make-up bag.

But instead of lipstick, little Emma Meaux from Abbeville, Louisiana, tries to claim the red stain all over her lips is ChapStick.

Video shows her then pulling a range of comical facial expressions as her mother, Mandy, continues to interrogate her.

'That's not ChapStick. That's mommy's lipstick. Where did you get it?' Mandy says. 

Uh-oh: This is the moment a four-year-old girl is caught red-faced - literally - after delving into her mother's make-up bag

Innocent until proven guilty: But instead of lipstick, little Emma Meaux from Abbeville, Louisiana, claims the red stain all over her lips is actually ChapStick 

Knowing that she's been busted, Emma admits that she did delve into 'mommy's make up'.

'And did mommy tell you not to play in the make-up?' her elder replies.

Emma responds with a nod 'yes'.

She then proceeds to rub her lips together in embarrassment and asks her mother to remove the stain.

She says that she doesn't like the deep plum color.

It's not the first time Emma has been caught getting up to mischief.

Last summer, she was filmed as she denied eating a chocolate donut and blamed the missing treat on her twin brother Ben.

However, the chocolate frosting all over her lips served as proof her guilt.

Doting parents: Mandy and her husband Brody struggled for years to conceive Emma and her twin brother Ben, the siblings were born eight weeks premature and spent a month in the Neonatal intensive care unit

The youngster's mother Mandy previously spoke to DailyMail.com about the twins, and unexpectedly revealed that Ben is usually the trouble-maker.

'Ben is definitely the more mischievous of the two, which is why the video was funny to my friends and family,' she explains. 'It was completely out of character for Emma.'

Mandy and her husband Brody struggled for seven years to conceive the twins, who were born eight weeks premature and spent a month in the Neonatal intensive care unit.

'That experience is the reason we try to enjoy all the moments, the good and the bad,' Mandy says.

Amusing as the videos are, Mandy says that instilling good morals in her children is definitely something she takes seriously.

'But we also waited a very long time to become parents and because of that we try to enjoy the moments that are funny as well,' she explains.

'We do correct them every time we see them doing something wrong. But that doesn't mean that we don't laugh when they aren't looking.'
