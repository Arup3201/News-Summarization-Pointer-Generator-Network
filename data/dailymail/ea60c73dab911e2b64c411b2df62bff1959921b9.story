Energy watchdog Ofgem needs to 'get its act together' to cut customers' energy bills, MPs have warned.

In a scathing attack on the market regulator, the Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee said Ofgem has failed to stop big companies from charging too much, despite new price caps intended to curb costs.

The committee said the new caps were too generous and that network companies – those responsible for the wires and pipes that distribute gas and electricity – had continued to make huge profits.

At the same, performance targets are too low and consumers are having to wait too long to see if Ofgem is delivering savings, it said. 

Committee chairman Tim Yeo said: 'Ofgem's chief executive told us that we would have to wait eight years to see whether value for money was being delivered for bill payers. This is too long for hard-pressed consumers to wait.

'Ofgem must get its act together and scrutinise these near monopolies more effectively. Simpler charging methodologies are needed to strengthen the market's ability to scrutinise costs and increase the pressure for greater cost-saving efficiencies.

'Barriers preventing smaller players from entering the market must be removed to drive down costs for consumers.'  

The so-called 'network costs' currently account for around 23 per cent of a gas and electricity dual fuel bill.

They are passed onto consumers by the energy suppliers, who are charged by the network companies for using their transmission and distribution infrastructure.

In 2013, Ofgem introduced a new price control system - known as RIIO - which was designed to ensure that the costs of distributing and transmitting gas and electricity were competitive and profits were not excessive.

But the committee said there was 'clear evidence' that the network companies were making higher profits than expected.

'This suggests that the targets and incentives set by Ofgem are too low, barriers to market entry are high and that Ofgem needs to monitor RIIO more effectively and to equip RIIO with stronger, corrective measures,' it said.

The Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee said Ofgem has failed to stop companies charging too much, despite  price caps intended to curb costs of distributing gas and electricity

'While we recognise that the new RIIO framework is an improvement on its predecessor, Ofgem has not yet created the conditions for the market to thrive and provide consumers with best value for money.'

The committee also highlighted the complexity of the charging system. It said a combination of codes and regional charges across the UK made it difficult to compare price and performance across network companies.

It called on the Government and Ofgem to conduct an in-depth study into the merits of replacing the current system with a standard national tariff.  

The price of oil has more than halved since last summer, while gas – the main source of electricity in Britain – has dropped by 29 per cent. But power firms have reduced their prices only modestly. 

British Gas will cut its prices by 5 per cent at the end of this month.

EDF has trimmed rates by just 1.3 per cent, while SSE has been ridiculed for refusing to introduce its 4.1 per cent cut until the end of April. 

Ed Miliband had pledged to freeze prices for two years if Labour wins power at the election in May. The policy has been widely criticised, and experts say many energy companies would have cut their tariffs sooner if the threat was not in place.

Critics have also warned that the move would sap investment from Britain. 

Last week, a report by the Competition and Markets Authority said customers of the Big Six energy suppliers are being overcharged by up to £234 a year for gas and electricity.

Ninety five per cent of the UK's 19million 'dual fuel' customers, those who get their gas and electricity from the same company, could have saved by switching, the probe found. 

Despite this, half of customers surveyed said they have never switched, and a third said they had never even considered it or thought switching was impossible.
