They are members of the nation's squattocracy from Australia's richest agricultural shire where the families of the landed gentry enjoy a life of picnic race meetings and the town and country club.

The Turnbulls - whose patriarch Ian Robert Turnbull stands accused of murdering government officer and father of two, Glen Turner, by shooting him in the back - are among the lucky families who live in Australia's 'Golden Triangle' around Moree in NSW's northwest.

The area earned the name because it is blessed by a temperate climate and abundant water supply both from inland rivers and the Great Artesian Basin, the rich black soil plains of Moree, Tamworth and Gunnedah in northern NSW stretching up to the Queensland border are so fertile, the locals say, 'they could grow babies'.

Balck gold: the black soil palins of Moree and teh area in northern NSW which borders Queensland known as the golden triangle attracts the country's highest wheat yield and is valued at more than $4000 per hectare. Grazier families going back generations in this region are regarded as Australia's rural aristocracy, of which accused murderer Ian Robert Turnbull is one

Wrong place: Environment and Heritage compliance officer Glen Turner, 51, (pictured) was allegedly shot in the back by wealthy farmer Ian Turnbull after the father-of-two served an illegal land clearing notice. The accused's family has lived in Australia's rich 'golden triangle' agricultural region since the 1880s among other families known as the nation's 'squattocracy'

Farmer Ian Turnbull (pictured, left) is accused of murdering environmental officer Glen Turner on Tuesday after the 79-year-old grazier whose family has been in the Moree area for more than a century allegedly shot Mr Turner in the back on a property at Croppa Creek, 60km north east of Moree. In a long running land dispute which began in 2011, Turnbull had pleaded guilty in the Land and Environment Court to illegally clearing native vegetation on land which was then ploughed, and sowed with crops which were harvested in late 2012

But this way of life for the privileged families who have occupied homesteads on cattle and crop stations for generations is under threat of disappearing.

And the allegations of murder against a prominent member of one of these families has blown a cover off the charmed lives enjoyed by those who own thousands of hectares worth millions of dollars.

Police allege Turnbull, a 79-year-old farmer whose family owns large tracts of land on the Moree Plains, shot Mr Turner, 51, an Environment and Heritage compliance officer at around 5.40pm on Tuesday on a property at Croppa Creek, 60km north-west of Moree.

The Turnbulls are said to have been in the area since the 1880s, own at least four homesteads and  and properties totalling thousands of hectares in a region where prime cropping land can reach up to $4300 a hectare.

On the way out: Allegations of murder against Ian Turnbull, a prominent member of one of the families who farm Australia's most lucrative wheat growing belt (pictured), around Moree in northern NSW, has blown the cover off the charmed lives enjoyed by those who own thousands of hectares worth millions. This way of life for the privileged families who have occupied homesteads on cattle and crop stations for generations is under threat of disappearing

Police allege Turnbull, a 79-year-old farmer whose family owns large tracts of land and homsteads on the Moree Plains, shot Mr Turner, 51, an Environment and Heritage compliance officer at around 5.40pm on Tuesday on a property near Croppa Creek, a town whose iconic grain silos, pictured, dominate the skyline) 60km north-west of Moree

Mr Turner had arrived at the property to serve a notice for illegally clearing vegetation off his land.

'If you look at this family inside the tragedy they are typical of squattocracy who have owned a lot of properties for generations,' country real estate agent and deputy president of the Real Estate institute of NSW, Malcolm Gunning told Daily Mail Australia.

'These are families who  used to own the flat in [exclusive Sydney suburb] Darling Point and show their cattle at the Royal Easter Show.

'For some that sort of life is coming to an end, but the local economies in these places are doing well.

'Their land is thousands for each hectare and this is where we are seeing a lot of interest from foreign investors.'

It could grow babies: So rich are the black soil plains in the 'golden triangle' region of northern NSW which stretches to the Queensland border that hectares of prime wheat cropping properties go for up to $4300 and the rich farming families that have been there for generations are regarded as Australia's rural landed gentry

The families who farm the black soil plains around Moree (pictured)  are the landed gentry who 'used to own the flat in [exclusive Sydney suburb] Darling Point and show their cattle at the Royal Easter Show ... their land is thousands for each hectare and this is where we are seeing a lot of interest from foreign investors.'

Daily Mail Australia spoke with a former Tamworth resident who did not want to be identified, but who said the wealth on the Moree Plains and the environmental laws were in a head on clash.

'There's massive wealth in Moree and it's led to some huge land disputes which never happened before land clearing was made illegal.

'The families who own this land think it's their right to do with it what they want and get in a fleet of 14 bulldozers and root rape it up and plant wheat.

'They are the local aristocracy and they've been there for more than a century.

'It's black volcanic soil and basalt and if you can clear the bush of lignum and brigalow to make way for crops you can make squillions.

'But you're dealing with an environment department which says some plants farmers would regard as weeds are native and can't be removed.'

The Turnbulls are well-respected among Australia's largest grain producers and family concerns who grow wheat, cotton, oil seeds like canola, olives and pecans in the Moree Plains Shire, which has a population of around 13.500 living on 18,000km of land.

Ian Turnbull and members of his family have been in disputes over land clearing with the Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) since 2011. Turnbull pleaded guilty to illegally clearing native vegetation between November 2011 and January 2012 after he bulldozed 421ha on Colorado (pictured, in an OEH submission document), owned by his son Grant, and 73ha on Strathdoon, owned by his grandson, Cory

Ian and Robeena Turnbull, their sons Grant and Roger and their grandchildren and the family companies own properties including  Colorado and Strathdoon which totalled 2500ha, as well as Wallam and Buckie Station, and numerous parcels of land making up thousands of hectares in and around the Moree Plains.

In April this year, RP Data showed recent grain property sales in the Moree area reached $4000 a hectare and some better know properties were going for up to $4300/ha.

'There are families who been there since the 1800s and they have substantial holdings, although 100,000 acres will do in this region because the soil is so good,' Mr Gunning said.

$4300 a hectare: The land where Ian Turnbull and his family own thousands of hectares in the Moree region (pictured) in northern NSW has a temperate climate, rich volcanic soil and plenty of irrigation from surface water or the Great Artesian Basin beneath it, making the Turnbulls and other families who go back generations among the nation's wealthiest graziers

'That's a very good income. Moree, Tamworth, Gunnedah and Dubbo are the booming cities of NSW.

'The crop prices are OK, there's been reasonable rain and if you look at the undulating land around Gunnedah with such good soil, you undersow the crop with clover so you can graze and what they do is rotate the livestock and the grain and they do it very very successfully.'

Ian Turnbull and members of his family have been in disputes over land clearing with the Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) since 2011.

Turnbull pleaded guilty in the Land and Environment Court to illegally clearing native vegetation between November 2011 and January 2012 after, the OEH said, he bulldozed 421ha on Colorado, owned by his son Grant, and 73ha on Strathdoon, owned by his grandson, Cory.

Documents filed by the department show that an environmental assessment of an application to clear grazing land on Colorado for cropping found there was a koala colony on the land. A survey lists brigalow as a threatened native plant.

Two properties of 999ha and 74ha were bought by Ian and Grant Turnbull in 2011 for $4m each.

The Land and Environment Court heard, after contracts were exchanged but before the sales settled, Mr Turnbull and another unnamed man felled 2708 trees on Colorado and 694 trees on Strathdoon, Fairfax Media reported

The felled timbers was burnt, the land was then ploughed, sprayed with herbicide and sowed with wheat and barley which was subsequently harvested in late 2012.

'He didn't lodge a DA to get rid of the trees and did it because he probably had done it before and he was pressed,' Mr Gunning said, 'it's a tragedy.

'The family would be devastated.'

A Croppa Creek farmer who knows Turnbull told Daily Mail Australia through an intermediary that 'land clearing is hard' on farmers.

A tearful Ian Robert Turnbull appeared distraught as he was led into the dock of Moree Local Court on Wednesday, where he was refused bail and remanded in custody.
