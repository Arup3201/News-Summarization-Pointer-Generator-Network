Many politicians might have dreamed of getting their own back on veteran broadcaster Nick Ferrari after a difficult on-air grilling.

But today Boris Johnson got the chance for retribution when he poured freezing water over the radio presenter in the latest ice bucket challenge.

The stunt took place live on LBC radio at the end of the London Mayor's monthly phone-in, with the two men using a paddling pool to prevent water damaging the studio.

Mr Johnson appeared reticent at first, fearing he might be nominated himself to take part in the ice bucket challenge which has become an internet craze

As Mr Johnson asked 'do you want both buckets?', Mr Ferrari replied: 'I want as much as you want to give me!'

Millions of pounds have been raised for charity through the internet craze, which sees videos of the challenge, and nominations, posted on social media.

Mr Ferrari revealed he had been nominated by hair stylist Nicky Clarke and former cricketer Darren Gough.

He reassured Mr Johnson: 'You're not involved in this in any way, and I'm not gonna nominate you.'

But he called on the London Mayor to help out with dumping the freezing water over his head.

'I'm not going to nominate you, but will you throw the water over my head now, if we go outside...there's a paddling pool standing by...would you throw a bucket...?

Mr Ferrari vowed to give money to Mr Johnson's Mayor's Reading Fund, as well as to cancer and motor neurone disease charities

Mr Ferrari promised to make a donation to cancer and motor neurone disease charities, and to the Mayor's Reading Fund.

Mr Johnson appeared taken back, and was heard saying 'well hang on'.

But Mr Ferrari insisted: 'There's no hang on, just throw the water over my head.'

Mr Johnson joked 'is it a dumper truck full of water' and likened it to his previous promise to be blasted by a water cannon, which he wants police to be able to use on the streets of London.

The stunt happened at the end of Mr Johnson's monthly phone-in on the national radio station

As he was handed the bucket, Mr Johnson exclaimed: 'Oh my god… I'm gonna use this bucket here.'

Mr Ferrari went on: 'Oh my goodness, that's a lot of water. Right. Thank you Mr Mayor. This is thanks to Nicky Clark and Darren Gough.

'I nominate my two sons, Nico and Seb, and I also nominate Julie Assange. And there's money going to the Mayor's fund.'

As Mr Johnson asked 'do you want both buckets?', Mr Ferrari replied: 'I want as much as you want to give me!'

Meanwhile George Osborne suggested that he will duck the ice bucket challenge - preferring a bigger donation and spending time pouring cold water over his Labour rival's plans.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls nominated Mr Osborne for the challenge last week after undertaking it himself - but despite mentioning it in the Commons, he pledged not to try and enforce it over the Despatch Box.

But the Chancellor immediately rebutted: 'Can I thank you for nominating me for the ice bucket challenge. I'd rather make the extra donation to charity and pour the cold water over your economic policies.'
