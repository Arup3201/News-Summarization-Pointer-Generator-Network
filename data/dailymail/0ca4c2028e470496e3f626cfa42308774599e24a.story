Mario Balotelli still has a future at Liverpool despite his poor form, according to club legend Ian Rush.

The Italian forward has scored just one goal since his £16million summer move from AC Milan, and some supporters have begun to question his worth to the side.

But Liverpool's record scorer insisted the 24-year-old has a role to play at the club.

Mario Balotelli still has a future at Liverpool despite his slow start at the club, according to legend Ian Rush

'He still has a future at Liverpool,' Rush told talkSPORT. 'The fans are some of the most patient, but he has to realise he's playing at Liverpool Football Club, not just any other club.

'He's got to show his commitment to the club by proving it on the pitch. 

'He's only 24 and he's got to learn he's at ,for me, the best club in the world. You've got to give 100 per cent every time you go out on that pitch. 

'You look at Real Madrid last night and you see (Karim) Benzema, you see (James) Rodriguez, you see (Cristiano) Ronaldo all running in behind the defenders - we didn't have that last night. 

The former Manchester City forward was off the pace against Real Madrid and was substituted at half-time 

'We're most probably quite predictable in the way we play.'

The former Manchester City man was also criticised for swapping shirts with Pepe at half time, an action Rush did not condone.

He said: 'The Liverpool fans are very knowledgeable, and you just don't do that (swap shirts at half time).

'I'm sure Brendan Rodgers will have a word with him behind closed doors.'

Balotelli was also criticised for swapping shirts with Real Madrid's Portuguese defender Pepe at half time 

Michael Owen, meanwhile, felt Balotelli's performance against Madrid highlighted just how much the club missed the injured Daniel Sturridge.

He tweeted: 'Just highlights how unbelievably good Suarez was and how much Daniel Sturridge is missed.

'I thought Brendan Rodgers spoke well in his post match interview. Doesn't seem happy with Balotelli. Signing him was always a risk. 

'If I was Brendan Rodgers I would pay an extra few million and try to get (Divock) Origi to the club 6 months earlier than originally agreed.'
