A survivor of the Columbine High School massacre lost his state football championship ring a decade ago and had it returned to him by a homeless veteran in California.

Evan Todd, 31, who was the first person shot in the library during the April 20, 1999 shooting spree in Colorado, lost the ring while on a speaking tour in California in 2003 or 2004.

Todd originally received the ring after his football team won the 1999 state championship just months after the shootings, which left 12 students and a teacher dead - before the two teenage gunmen killed themselves, according to the Denver Post.

Bobby Smith, 60, a homeless veteran returned the ring engraved with Todd's name last week after finding it among stones in a creek in San Luis Obispo, California while searching for arrowheads.

Smith (above with the ring) was a Vietnam War veteran and was also living in a homeless shelter in San Luis Obispo when he tracked Todd down through Columbine High School. He called Todd last month to tell him he found the ring, which he took to a couple of sports shops to have it authenticated

He said when he saw it, he instantly recognized the name of the high school and knew it was a special ring. 

Todd, a starter on the 1999 team that won the Class 5A state championship, was shot in the back by one of the gunmen before he was hit in the face with shrapnel during the massacre.

The shooting, at the time, was named the worst in the history of the American school system.

Smith, a Vietnam War veteran, was living in a homeless shelter in San Luis Obispo when he tracked down Todd after contacting his old football coach, Andy Lowry, at the high school, according to The Blaze.

He called Todd last month to tell him he found the ring, which he took to a couple of sports shops to have it authenticated.

Todd said he was thrilled to have the ring back, which he said he would have over a Super Bowl ring (pictured above) any day

One shop owner offered him $2,000 for the ring while another suggested they sell it on eBay and split the profits.

Smith, who met Todd for the first time on Fox and Friends last Thursday in New York, said he told one shop owner: 'Yes, I'd like to take the money, but no, I can't, because it wouldn't be the right thing to do, because if it was my ring, I would certainly want it back.'

Todd said he was thrilled to have the ring back, which he said he would have over a Super Bowl ring any day.

'We went through so much together as a team and community. The ups and downs, the adversity, the microscope we were under,' he said.

'Those challenges were unlike any other that we had to deal with. It was a magical season for sure. But that ring had all of those emotions tied up in it,' added Todd.

Todd has since set up a GoFundMe page and said half of the proceeds will go to Smith and the rest will be given to other homeless veterans.

Todd, a starter on the 1999 team who won the Class 5A crown, was shot in the back by one of the gunmen before he was hit in the face with shrapnel during the April 1999 massacre - named the worst shooting in the history of the American school system at the time (above SWAT policemen arrive at the high school in Littleton following the shootout)

'It's a simple act of doing the right thing, nothing really special. You never know what you'll do in life. You learn a lot about yourself. I'm just glad he got it back,' said Smith.

On Monday evening, the fund had raked in $104,000 in donations. 

However, Smith said he has to figure out whether he would lose any veterans benefits before he could accept donations.

'I'm not asking for anything. I just wanted to do the right thing,' said Smith. 'I'm blessed. God works in mysterious ways.' 

Columbine High School Massacre, April 20, 1999: 13 victims dead, 21 injured

On the morning of Tuesday, April 20 in 1999 two students from Columbine High School, in Colorado, carried out a shooting spree in which they shot dead 13 people and injured another 21.

The highly organised attack was carried out by senior students Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17. 

The two, armed with an arsenal of guns and explosives, stalked the school campus firing indiscriminately at teachers and students.

The shooting lasted just under one hour. Although police had responded, the two shooters are thought to have committed suicide simultaneously by shooting themselves.

Because the two killed themselves there remained a wide range of speculation about their motivation.

The killers' interests of music and video games was scrutinized, as were concerns the two had been victims of bullies and were suffering from mental health issues.

It also sparked an intense public debate on the issue of gun control in the U.S. with campaigners calling for stronger gun control measures.

The crime has become one of the most notorious shootings in modern U.S. history. 

At the time it was considered one of the country's worst in terms of total death toll - but this has been surpassed by more heinous shootings in recent years.

It was also the subject of a 2002 Michael Moore documentary - in which the director explored the context of the massacre with regards to U.S. gun control laws and violence in society.
