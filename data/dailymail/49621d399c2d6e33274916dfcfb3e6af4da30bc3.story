The family of a 10-year-old girl killed in a skiing accident in Austria paid tribute to her yesterday - and told how her death will save or transform the lives of four other people.

Jemima Prees died instantly when she lost a control and hit a tree at high speed during a half-term holiday at Mayrhofen in the Austrian Alps.

Her older brother Bradley, a university student, rushed to her side and fought for 40 minutes to resuscitate her. His efforts enabled her organs to be saved for donation.

'A very special Girl': Jemima Prees, 10, died instantly when she lost a control and hit a tree at high speed during a half-term holiday at Mayrhofen in the Austrian Alps

Jemima was flown by helicopter to hospital in Innsbruck but it was too late to save her.

Her family, from Colerne near 
Chippenham, Wiltshire, said she was wearing a helmet and 'taking it very
carefully' before the accident.

In a statement released today they said: 'Jemima was a very, very special girl. She lived every day as if there might be no tomorrow.

'She had a capacity to touch people with love in a way that is rarely seen. It was a privilege to know her for nearly 11 years.

'She was quirky, intelligent, 
fearless, but most of all, always warm and amusing. Everyone loved her. 
We were so lucky to have shared so much time with her.'

Jemima Prees was described as 'a lovely little girl - the apple of her parents' eye' by a neighbour in the village where she lived

Jemima from Colerne, nr Chippenham, 
Wilts., was a pupil at independent 
Calder House School in Colerne which caters for children aged 5-12 with 
dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia and language difficulties.

She was on her last run of the day with her lawyer father Tim, 50, 
and brother when Sunday's accident happened. Her mother Karen, a 46 year-old GP, had already returned to the bottom of the mountain.

Her family said she had died in a 'beautiful place' doing something she loved, with some of her favourite people.

'She was skiing within her ability and taking it very carefully, within yards of us,' they said.

'No one will know why she suddenly 
went straight down the piste or why she didn't turn or fall. After a 
hundred yards, she hit trees at a high speed.

Witnesses said the girl lost control on the piste near Tirol, in Austria, pictured, before crashing into a tree

'She died instantly at the scene from a
major brain injury but her brother's heroic 40 minutes of resuscitation
enabled her organs to be donated to save or transform four people's 
lives.

'We are very proud of him, as we were proud of her.

'We would now like to be given the space to grieve as a family, and to attempt to begin rebuilding our lives.'

Tim Prees is a lawyer specialising in Personal Dispute Resolution and Employment Law.

Karen studied medicine at the University of Bristol and has worked as a GP partner for fifteen years in Batheaston.

Her practice's website lists her as a GP trainer with a special interest in communication and consultation skills.
