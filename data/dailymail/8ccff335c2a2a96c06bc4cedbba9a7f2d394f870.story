The father of a top law professor who was shot dead at his home has spoken for the first time at his family's 'frustration' that his son's killer has yet to be caught.

It is almost eight months since Dan Markel was gunned down in an execution style killing as he sat in his car in the garage of his home in Florida.

The 41-year-old father of two young sons, who worked at Florida State University, was shot in the head.

There was no sign of a struggle and nothing was taken from his home with police quickly saying he was the 'intended target'.

Out of the blue: Florida State University law professor Dan Markel was talking on his phone when he was shot in the head last July. He leaves two young sons

But despite an extensive police investigation into the murder last July by a team of detectives in Tallahassee, Florida, no suspect has been arrested.

There has been no hint of a breakthrough in the murder that shocked his many colleagues at Florida State University and in the wider legal world.

Detectives appear to have few leads to follow up on leading family members of Markel fearing his unexplained death will become a cold case.

In his first public comments on the murder Markel's father Phillip expressed fears the case will never be solved.

'I know nothing will bring our son back but we would like some closure,' said Phillip Markel in an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Online.

'The investigation seems to have stalled and it is just so frustrating for the family. We want to see the killer caught and brought to justice.'

Mr Markel, who lives in Toronto, Canada, said he has his own theories about who killed his son but said without firm evidence he is not willing to share them.

'It is frustrating as we are at a standstill and that means we cannot have closure and just have to live with it. That is not the best situation.

'I have my own theory who killed Dan, but I do not have the proof and am unwilling to share them.'

Some colleagues had speculated that a posting Markel wrote on his now defunct blog PrawfsBlawg.could have somehow been the key to him being targeted.

Markel was the subject of an anonymous threatening post. 

'Bullies like this need to be made radioactive,' a person wrote about Markel's comments.

'Their arrogance and imperiousness speaks for itself. All means necessary must be employed.'

Police have not said if the person who made the post has been traced.

Markel, who was also educated at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, was also on the receiving end of a series of strange messages.

Several months before his death he began receiving unsolicited Facebook friend requests.

Markel wrote: 'Is anyone else getting pestered just in the last week or so by obviously ridiculous or malevolent friend requests on fb from people with sham profiles all over the world w no possible connection to you?

'It feels like an onslaught of the Facebook equivalent of Cialis and Nigerian prince scams.'

One friend jokingly replied, 'It might just be all your friends creating alter egos on Ambien.?'

Other friends soon put his mind at rest when they too said they had received the requests. One female friend wrote that she had received four such requests.

Markel was on a cell phone call while driving his Honda Accord back home. After pulling the car into the garage, he was followed in by an assailant who fired one shot at Markel's head through the car window, then left

Markel was alive when cops arrived, with the keys in the ignition of his car, before being pronounced dead at the hospital hours later, police said. Markel was apparently on the phone at the time of the shooting, remarking to the person on the phone that someone was in the driveway

Close friends of the popular law professor have expressed their anger that the suspect remains at large.

Many have taken to blogs in an attempt to keep people talking about Markel as they search for answers to the killing.

Markel, a former Harvard Law  school graduate, was sitting in the driver's seat of his car talking on the phone when he was killed on the morning of July 18th 2014.

Local police quickly ruled out robbery as a motive and said he was the 'intended victim'.

At the time he was involved in a contentious divorce with his wife Wendi Adelson who had wanted to return to Miami, Florida, following the breakup of their nine-year marriage.

The law professor obtained a court order preventing Wendi, who also worked at FSU, from leaving the city with their two children.

Wendi, 35, has since moved to south Florida and has cooperated fully with the police.

Soon after her husband's murder she quit her job at the University as a professor and left the city.

She is believed to be living near her parents Harvey and Donna in Coral Gables, Miami.

Her lawyer Jimmy Judkins said she had cooperated fully with police.

He said she was in fear of her life and would not be making any comment until the investigation was resolved.

He said:'Ms. Adelson requests that the media respect her privacy as she helps her children overcome the unexpected loss of their father. She remains deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of her children.

'During the ongoing investigation of this tragedy, Ms. Adelson will not be making any further public comments.

'She, and every person acting for her, will decline any further requests for information, interviews, or appearances. She encourages anyone who may have information that could help identify the person or persons responsible to please contact the Tallahassee Police Department.'

The only real clue to the killer came from a neighbor of the Markels who heard a gunshot and saw a silver Toyota Prius leaving the scene.

Police have refused to say if the car has been traced.

When contacted by Daily Mail Online to discuss the investigation a police spokesman said they had no comment and a spokesman did not return calls.

Colleagues of Professor Markel have been left baffled by his murder.

His close friend and fellow FSU professor Mark Spottswood is among those who fears the killer might never be caught.

'The heart is hungry for closure, but you keep reminding yourself that the wrong story is worse than no story,' Spottswood told the Tallahassee Democrat.

'It's just a tragic situation. I'm increasingly not optimistic that we're not going to have an answer.'

He added: 'He wasn't the sort of person who would make the kind of enemies who would do something this violent and horrific

'There's always the disturbing possibility that a former student had some kind of mental breakdown, but I think most of the students regarded him highly.

'We're left with something random and horrific or something about his life his better friends didn't know about, or the former student who loses their mind,' he added. 'It's just a tragic situation.'

Friends of Markel said, despite the bitter divorce and breakup of his family, he had moved on with his life.

Wendi Adelson, 35, has since moved to south Florida and has cooperated fully with the police

He was reported to be seeing a new woman,although she has never been identified.

New York University law professor Rick Hills told the Toronto Star that he last saw Markel when he came to stay in Manhattan two weeks before his death.

Hills revealed that Markel was moving on in his life and was now happy in a new relationship with a woman after going through his divorce.

'He was rebuilding his life after a really, really difficult period,' Hills said.

'I was watching him as he was in my apartment Skyping his kids and saying goodnight on his cellphone,he was so happy.'

In the day after Markel's death the anguish for the Markel family was made worse after it was revealed a mix up by the emergency dispatchers led to paramedics taking over 15 minutes to reach the professor.

The caller said:'You need to send an ambulance in a hurry He's still alive, he's still moving.'

Markel died the following day and an internal investigation revealed that his shooting had been wrongly prioritized.

The uncertainty over Markel's death adds to the pain and grief of his parents Phillip and Ruth.

They have remained in contact with his ex-wife and speak to their grandchildren, Benjamin, five and Lincoln,four.

Mr Markel remains optimistic police can crack the case.

'Of course I am hopeful that the police will find the person who killed my son,' he said.

'Murder is such a serious crime, particularly in Florida where there is the death penalty. The person who did this wanted to harm my son, of that I am sure.'

Mr Markel said he keeps in contact with Tallahassee Police who update him on any new information they obtain as part of the investigation.
