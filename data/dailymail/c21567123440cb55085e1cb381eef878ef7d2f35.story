One modest lump can fetch a small fortune. A large piece can turn its finder into a millionaire.

It’s the most valuable organic substance known to man — and you can find it from nothing more strenuous than a walk on the beach.

This week, Ken Wilman was strolling on Morecambe Bay with his dog when he spotted something odd: a fatty, smelly lump. He thought little more of it until he got home and decided to act on a hunch.

Ken Wilman found a lump of rare whale vomit or 'ambergris' on Morecambe beach when he was walking his dog

He Googled ‘ambergris’ and hit the jackpot. ‘There’s gold out there on the beach!’ he proclaimed on Radio 4 yesterday. ‘Floating gold!’

Ken has already been offered £43,000 for his find. Last year, eight-year-old Dorset schoolboy Charlie Naysmith found a similar deposit near Bournemouth, said to be worth £40,000.

But just what is this weird substance that has made them rich?

The truth is even stranger than you might think — and takes us from the deepest ocean to the glamour of fashion, and from the stuff produced in the belly of the biggest predator that ever lived to the most delectable fragrance human beings have devised.

That predator is the sperm whale: the 
monumental leviathan and real-life model for Moby-Dick. Sperm whales 
suffer under many misapprehensions and superlatives.

It is they — not polar bears, as a 
recent BBC documentary insisted — who are the greatest predator. They 
are bigger even than any carnivorous dinosaur. They also possess the 
largest brain of any animal (quite what they do with it is another 
matter).

Ken Wilman's dog Madge dug up the smelly substance which turned out to be whale dung

And as Mr Wilman’s find proves, these 
incredible animals also excrete (rather than vomit, as most media 
coverage would have you believe), the world’s most valuable dung — since
 that is what ambergris is.

It
 is a kind of cholesterol that forms around the by-product of a sperm 
whale’s main food source, squid — the hard beaks of which occasionally 
get caught in the animal’s lower gut.

Hunted
 or stranded whales that have been cut open have been found with tens of
 thousands of such beaks, which are shiny black snapping mechanisms like
 parrot’s beaks and composed of keratin, like human fingernails.

As they snag in the whale’s 
intestines, the sticky, fatty ‘cholesterol’ forms around them, like 
pearls forming around pieces of grit in oysters. Some lumps of ambergris
 may contain many squid beaks.

The
 biological reason for this may be to protect the whale’s gut from 
ulcers. But it seems to happen in just one in 100 whales — one per cent 
of the population. There are around 360,000 sperm whales in the world, 
so that’s quite a lot of ambergris floating about.

The coalescing lump is expelled as 
dung. Probably with relief: sperm whale poo is usally a runny red cloud 
in the water (and rather odiferous in its own way, as I can attest, 
having been next to a young whale when it decided to discharge in my 
direction).

Lighter than 
water, the ambergris floats and matures in the sea,  turning from a 
sticky brown mass to a grey, waxy, shiny blob. Hence its name from the 
French for ‘grey amber’, after the golden, fossilised resin that is 
often found on the Baltic’s shores.

For centuries ambergris has been imbued 
with wonderful properties. The ancient Chinese called it  ‘dragon’s 
spittle fragrance’ and used it to spice their wine, believing it to be 
an aphrodisiac.

Sperm whales excrete the world's most valuable dung, known as ambergis

Sperm whales can grow up to 18 metres and their dung has been used as an aphrodisiac

In the Middle Ages, it was burned as incense and as a preventative against plague.

In
 Milton’s Paradise Lost, Satan tempts Christ with ‘Grisamber steamed’. 
Aristocrats of the Renaissance wore it moulded, dried and decorated as 
jewellery. 

Charles II used
 to eat it with his eggs, rather in the way an epicure might now shave 
truffle over an  omelette. Sailors, with readier access to the stuff, 
had a more prosaic use for it: they employed it as a laxative.

When researching my book on whales, I
 was made privy to the secret formula for the sacred oil used to anoint 
British monarchs in the coronation ceremony.

In
 the private library set high in the upper storey of Westminster Abbey, I
 was shown a recipe handed down over the centuries: Oleaum Praescriptum 
Ad Ungendum in Coronatione Carolum 1 Britannae Regem.

Sperm whales can grow up to 18 metres and their dung can be used as an aphrodisiac

Along with oils of jasmine, rose and 
cinnamon, Ambraegristiae is listed as well as the exact amount required.
 But Queen Victoria objected to the smell so much that she washed it off
 immediately on her return from the Abbey.

It
 was in the mid-Atlantic archipelago of the Azores — where I had my own 
close encounters with the  magnificent sperm whales — that I got to 
smell ambergris.

There, Dr
 Malcolm Clarke, a British scientist working on the island of Pico, 
handed me a small plastic box. When I opened it, the smell hit me.

But inside was what looked like just a
 lump of mud. The aroma is almost indescribable — peaty, earthy, with 
undertones of dung, but incredibly powerful and elusive at the same 
time, with a lingering after-smell I can only compare to pure patchouli,
 the oil much favoured by hippies in the Sixties.

It stayed on my fingers for three days, and a smear of it still scents my notebook.

Herman
 Melville, who devoted a whole chapter to it in Moby-Dick, wrote: ‘Who 
would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale 
themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a whale! 
Yet so it is.’

And indeed the quality of scent is why ambergris is highly prized — although not the only reason. It is also valued by the perfume industry for its extraordinary ability to capture other, more fugitive scents.

It is the perfect fixative, for which no synthetic substitute has been found, and it ensures that perfumes retain their smell.

Modern chemical analysis shows the active element is ambrien, a crystalline, fatty cholesterol that slows the evaporation of volatile oils.

Molecular chemistry, as sophisticated as it is, still cannot replicate ambrien’s complexity.

That explains the secretive trade in this strange substance — and the inflated sums paid for good, pure samples.

The beach that's paved with gold: Morecambe bay was where Ken Wilman found a valuable lump of whale dung

The large lump of whale dung was found washed up at Morecambe Bay in Lancashire

Ambergis like that found on Morecambe beach is valued at around £800/lb

In 1891, fisherman Louis Smith actually climbed into the belly of a dead whale in Tasmania — like a latter-day Jonah — to dig out a boulder-sized piece of ambergris.

It weighed 162 lb, 11 oz, and fetched him £11,000. That’s more than half-a-million pounds in today’s money.

More recently, a huge lump was found in south-western Australia that was worth £100,000.

Today, a large, 30kg lump can keep a perfume house supplied for 20 years, at a cost to them of around £500,000. But the quality varies greatly, hence the fluidity of its price.

Ambergris sells at an average of around £800 per pound on the international market — although the best pieces can fetch much more.

The smooth, white boulders demanded by Chanel and Dior, Yves St Laurent and Givenchy command the highest prices. The lucky finders of these elusive specimens can name their price.

Even now there are men living on remote beaches who dedicate their lives to looking for ambergris.

Ambergis is used in perfumes such as Chanel No 5

American molecular biologist Christopher
 Kemp set out to trace the sometimes dark and even sinister trail of 
ambergris in his compelling book Floating Gold.

He found piratical exponents of the art of finding it on far-flung Stewart Island, a New Zealand possession in the Pacific Ocean.

His inquiries there were met with stone walls of silence — and even vague threats of violence. No one wanted to give away their secrets. 

One trader made it clear to  Kemp that the ambergris he supplied formed the basis for such famous scents as Chanel No 5 and Guerlain’s Shalimar.

Creed’s of London, one of the world’s oldest perfumers, has been making whale-infused perfumes for centuries. One was worn by Prince Louis Napoleon in the 19th century.

More recently, another was made especially for English-born Hollywood star Cary Grant.

Having smelt ambergris myself, I can now identify it in perfumes. Sometimes I’ll walk into a party  and immediately know someone is wearing it.

When you read that a perfume has ‘amber undertones’, you may be sure it owes them to ambergris. 

Truly, this is an amazing journey. A substance born in the guts of an  animal that spends most of its time in the deepest seas ends up on  the counter of your local department store. 

So check your own perfume. You may be wearing the smell of whale poo today.
