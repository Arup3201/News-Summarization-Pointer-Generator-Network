Tory MPs have accused Liberal 
Democrats of blackmailing them into supporting plans for the reform of 
the House of Lords, that they warn will hand Nick Clegg's party the 
balance of power in British politics.

Tory backbenchers are preparing the 
biggest revolt of David Cameron's leadership over the issue when it 
comes to the Commons on Tuesday.

Today senior Right-winger David Davis 
describes plans to create an upper house where 80 per cent of members 
are elected by proportional representation as 'an attempt by Lib Dems to
boost their presence in the upper chamber by rigging the electoral 
system in their favour'.

Threat: Liberal Democrats will block parliamentary boundary changes if rebel Tory MPs kill off plans to reform the House of Lords, it was claimed today

Writing in the Daily Mail, the former 
Shadow Home Secretary argues the reforms will give the Lib Dems 'a 
pivotal position in all future elections'.

Fellow Tories reacted with fury 
yesterday after Mr Clegg's closest aide said the Deputy Prime Minister 
would block changes to parliamentary boundaries, which will benefit the 
Tories, if Tories vote down plans for Lords reform.

Under the plans to be debated next 
week, elections to the upper house would be held alongside general 
elections to the Commons, with the first in 2015. Members would be 
elected in tranches of 120 at each of the next three elections, with the
process completed by 2025.

More than 80 Tory backbenchers are 
threatening to wreck the proposals in Commons votes next week, with 
several members of the government considering quitting to join them.

Richard Reeves, who is stepping down 
as director of strategy, said the Lib Dems would block plans to cut the 
number of MPs from 650 to 600 – a measure which some experts believe 
could give the Tories an additional 20 seats at the next general 
election.

'The idea that failure to deliver a Government commitment on 
Lords reform would be consequence-free is for the birds,' he said.

Nick Clegg's outgoing director of 
strategy, Richard Reeves (right) said there would be 'broader 
consequences' for the coalition if it didn't win a vote on Lords reform

'Anyone who thinks Nick Clegg will 
shrug his shoulders, say “never mind” and “everyone tried our best”, 
will be in for a rude awakening. That is not going to happen.'

Mr Clegg's aides made clear Mr Reeves 
was speaking for himself but say the Deputy Prime Minister 'expects 
Lords reform to be delivered'. Tories are livid since the coalition 
agreement, often trumpeted by Mr Clegg, linked the boundary changes with
his cherished referendum on electoral reform. Tories kept their side of
the bargain by allowing the nationwide vote last year, in which his 
Alternative Vote system was rejected.

A No 10 source accused Mr Reeves of raising the threat of reprisals in 'a most ungentlemanly fashion'.

Tory MP Peter Bone said: 'If [the Lib 
Dems] are going to do that then Clegg and co should go, and let the 
Prime Minister govern as a minority Conservative administration. To try 
to blackmail like this is the lowest.'

Rebel Tories are being warned the 
Commons may have to sit through August if they vote down the timetable 
for debating Lords reform next week. One MP last night condemned the 
threat as 'a bullying tactic by the whips'.
