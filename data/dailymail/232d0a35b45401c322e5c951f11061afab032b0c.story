Euro record-breaker Robbie Keane reckons the Republic of Ireland are 'playing Germany at a good time' in Gelsenkirchen on Tuesday night.

Germany suffered a shock defeat by Poland on Saturday night, and Keane said: 'They are the World Cup winners but a few players have since retired and a few others are injured. Will that make a big difference? I'm not too sure. I hope it does but I think we are in a better place going there than we were before.

'To have six points going into the Germany game gives the players a lot of confidence. I believe we can go there and get something from the game.'

After his third Irish hat-trick, and his quickest, in the 7-0 thrashing of Gibraltar on Saturday, Keane, who scored three goals in the first 18 minutes, spoke of how he puts the team first now, compared to his teenage days. 'As you get older, you appreciate that it's about the team more. When you're young, you're hungry and a lot more selfish,' said the Irish captain.

Keane's first Irish goals of 2014 were timely. 'You are judged by scoring goals. It's the most important thing for any striker, to score goals and get your confidence up,' he said. 

With 65 goals, Keane is joint 14th on the list of all-time international scorers; and fifth in Europe behind Ferenc Puskas (84 goals), Sandor Kocsis (75), Miroslav Klose (71) and Gerd Muller (68). In the Euro qualifiers, Keane is out on his own with a record 21 goals, the same number the previous holder, Niall Quinn, managed in total for Ireland.

'It's nice to have it (Euro record) but I will forget about it and focus now on Tuesday's game,' he said. When Keane first burst on to the Irish scene in 1998, Quinn predicted his fellow Dubliner would go on to score 50 goals for Ireland; by coincidence, Keane eclipsed Quinn's Irish 21-goal mark 10 years ago on Monday. Keane has pep in his step after surgery on his heels at the end of last year to cure a nagging achilles problem.

'I feel great, I struggled for two years with the achilles injury and it's just nice to play a game and not come off being hardly able to walk. And then wake up in the morning struggling to walk.'

With Irish manager Martin O'Neill leaning towards a 'horses for courses' strategy, there are no guarantees that Saturday's star performers will start against Germany, including Keane. 

'It's important that everybody is ready because you never know when you are going to be called upon,' he said.
