A Pakistani mother who gave birth to sextuplets last week is devastated after being told that two of her babies have died from infections.

The woman gave birth to four girls and two boys at the hospital in the Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Doctors said the sextuplets and their mother, who has not been named, were healthy and in a stable condition after their birth on Friday.

But today Abdur Rahman Wazir, the father of the infants, confirmed two girls had died due to a severe infection.

Wazir told a local Pakistani newspaper: 'We had decided to celebrate the birth of six children but God took two of our babies from us.'

The name of the mother has not been revealed owing to strict local customs, which restrict naming of females in public.

But Wazir, who is a tribesman from Datta Khel in Pakistan's volatile North Waziristan province, said the other four babies are 'doing fine'.

The odds of having sextuplets are extremely low, with one occurring in every 4.5 million pregnancies.

But many end in miscarriages and, even if the babies defy the odds, the mortality rate is high. In more than 90 per cent of sextuplet births, one or more will die before their first birthday.

Wazir's wife had given birth to six babies, two boys and four girls at a private clinic in Bannu city.

She had attended a clinic for a routine check-up, but later went into labour.

The infants were then shifted to the Combined Military Hospital, where they were found to be underweight and subsequently put on incubators.

However, doctors at the military hospital said the mother was healthy and in a stable condition.

'We are devastated by the fact that two infants could not make it. The other four babies are doing very well,' a gynaecologist told local reporters.

'We are still monitoring their condition. The mother is also recuperating very well. But she is in shock for having lost two babies.'
