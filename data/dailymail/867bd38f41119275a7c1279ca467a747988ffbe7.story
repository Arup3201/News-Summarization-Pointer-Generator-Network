When Brave was released, parents were rightfully delighted that finally a Disney film had been made with a strong female role model who didn’t need a Prince to whisk her off her feet.

Unlike most other Disney heroines, the animation character of Princess Merida looked like a real girl, complete with the ‘imperfections’ most people have.

But now the plucky freckled redhead has been given a makeover for a new range of toys – which critics claim has left the character looking ‘sexualised’.

The character’s new doll and its promotional images appear slimmer, older and more glamorous compared with Merida’s more homespun tomboy look in last year’s Oscar-winning Pixar animation.

The free-spirited Scottish archer has been given an unrealistically tiny waist, sleekly tousled hair, bigger eyes, a buxom chest, longer lashes and manicured eyebrows. And her new look has not gone down at all well with Brave fans.

A petition calling on Disney to return the character to her more realistic origins has reached more than 200,000 signatures in less than two weeks.

Merida is not a typical Disney heroine and became popular for her strength, feistiness and skill with a bow

And, according to critics on Twitter, 
the makeover has stripped away the positive things Merida represented to
young girls – her confidence, disregard for the way she looks and her 
lack of desire to be rescued by a handsome Prince.

The mischievous, innocent look in her eye has also gone, they say.

Now the petition, on the website change.org has gained the support of one of Merida’s original creators, Brenda Chapman.

Mrs Chapman, who was replaced as director by Mark Andrews part way through the production of Brave but maintained a co-director’s credit, said: ‘I think it’s atrocious what they have done to Merida.

‘When little girls say they like [the new toy] because it’s more sparkly, that’s all fine and good but, subconsciously, they are soaking in the sexy “come-hither” look and the skinny aspect of the new version. It’s horrible!'

She added: ‘Merida was created to break that mould. To give young girls a better, stronger role model, a more attainable role model, something of substance, not just a pretty face that waits around for romance.’

Other characters in the Disney Princess Collection, including Snow White, Cinderella and the Little Mermaid’s Ariel, all have similar body shapes but appear to not have been altered from the original animations.

Disney said it uses different styles of art on characters regularly, ‘changing them to fit their needs at the time’.

Following complaints, Disney has removed the new Merida image from its Princess Collection website.
