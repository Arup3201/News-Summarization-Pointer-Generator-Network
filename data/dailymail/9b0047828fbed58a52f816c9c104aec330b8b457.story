Having already witnessed a footballing miracle by Roy Hodgson, England’s assistant manager Ray Lewington has faith in him to deliver something equally special in Brazil.

Lewington was at Fulham in December 2007 when Hodgson saved them from relegation on the final day of the Barclays Premier League season before taking the club to the Europa League final.

‘It was unbelievable,’ said Lewington. ‘When Roy came to the club, I witnessed what was virtually a football miracle.

Miracle: England assistant Ray Lewington witnessed Roy Hodgson keep Fulham in the Premier League in 2008

‘I actually saw a team who were going to be relegated and had hardly won a game all year turn into a team that finished seventh the following year and then got to a European final the year after. 

‘And that was with very little money by Premier League standards. He did it with shape and organisation. Slowly, you could see the belief coming into players who, six months earlier, couldn’t pass 15 yards from A to B; who had looked so scared and unsure. That is the transformation, when you see players almost re-invent themselves. It happened in front of me.

‘The one thing, of course, is that in international football you don’t get the same amount of time with the players. So this is our best time.’
