A new record for the longest ever table tennis rally has been set by a father and son who played for an incredible eight hours and 40 minutes.

Peter and Daniel Ives continuously hit the ball 32,000 times, without even stopping for a toilet break, during the challenge on Sunday at Plumstead Radical Club in London.

The pair were aiming to play for 10 hours but stopped when 50-year-old bricklayer, Mr Ives, missed the shot and the ball hit his finger.

The father and son completed the feat by drinking 
energy drinks, eating Jaffa Cakes and even taking painkillers, due to 
their aching shoulders to beat the previous record by just 10 minutes.

The challenge was broadcast live on the internet to more than 7,000 table tennis fans.

Daniel Ives, of Bradley Stoke, Bristol, said: 'The last five minutes was very nerve-wracking heading towards the record.

The pair broke the previous world record by 10 minutes and each player hit the ball an average of 16,000 times during the rally

'The whole room went completely silent. Then there was a huge cheer when we passed the mark.

'I have never put so much concentration into one thing, I had to remain focussed every second throughout.

'It was so difficult getting to the record and the last five minutes felt like hours.

The pair kept the rally going for eight hours and 40 minutes, breaking the previous record by 10 minutes.

Each player hit 16,000 shots during the challenge, meaning a total of 32,000 shots were completed.

As table tennis burns around 272 calories an hour, the pair will have burned around 2,359 calories each.

Jaffa Cakes, energy drinks and pain killers were consumed to keep the record attempt on track.

They have now raised £1,400 for charity by completing the feat.

'We wanted to continue until 10 hours but I think when we got past the mark we were so relieved to get there we just broke down and our concentration lapsed.

'Our playing just relaxed and ten minutes later the ball hit my dad’s finger and it was all over.

'The eight hours drove us absolutely insane. We did three practice sessions of five hours and they felt like a lifetime but this was so much more intense.

'But we had a lot of people there with us for the record and there was a lot of support.

'My shoulder was killing me and I only got through it with energy drinks and painkillers and Jaffa Cakes.'

The father and son were aiming to beat the previous record of eight hours, 30 minutes and six seconds set by Americans Max Fergus and Luke Logan in August 2013.

Despite initially starting well, at the six hour mark, the pair were starting to suffer shoulder and wrist pain.

But they battled through hitting the ball roughly once every second - meaning each player played around 16,000 shots.

As playing table tennis can burn around 272 calories an hour, the pair will have burned around 2,359 calories each.

Mr Ives, a coach at the Bristol Table Tennis Academy for Sport, added: 'It feels great having broken the world’s longest table tennis rally for a sport everyone has played.

'I’m involved with the sport everyday through my coaching so it is cool to say I’m the record holder for the longest rally.”

The 24-year-old, who has been playing the sport for 14 years, first came up with the idea during a conversation with his father on New Year’s Eve.

The father and son decided to attempt the challenge to raise money for the charity Prostate Cancer UK

His girlfriend's father had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and they were keen to raise money for Prostate Cancer UK.

So far they have raised £1,400 for the charity.

Mr Ives said: 'I am overwhelmed by the donations and support we got throughout the record.'
