Escaped jail: Rachel Hall was given a suspended sentence after driving her car at a group of special needs pupils who throw snowballs at her car

A woman who drove her car at a group of special needs children when they threw snowballs at her vehicle has been spared jail.

Motorist Rachel Hall mounted the kerb and drove her car at two boys among a group of pupils who had run into the street and launched snowballs at the passing vehicle.

A court heard Hall did not hit the pupils but came back along the road a short time later, drove onto the playing field where the youngsters were and into a girl, who had been making a snowball.

The girl was taken to hospital, where she was treated for minor injuries to her calf and foot.

Hall, a mother-of-five, admitted dangerous driving at an earlier hearing but denied striking or injuring the girl, and was given a three month jail term, which was suspended for one year.

The court heard the pupils from Priory Hurworth House School in Darlington, a specialist school for seven to 19-year-old's with complex learning difficulties, had skipped class on February 6 last year.

Teachers had tracked them down to Westfield Drive and were trying to get them back to school when they targeted Hall, who was taking her youngest child to nursery school.

Prosecutor Rachel Masters told Teesside Crown Court: 'The defendant shouted out of the window,
'Are you supposed to be in control of them?'

Teacher Jason Todd apologised and explained that staff were trying to get the pupils back to school.

Ms Masters added: 'The defendant's car mounted the kerb and the engine started revving.'

Teachers described seeing Hall's Renault Scenic wheel spinning and heading for the two boys.

A short while later, Hall drove back along the road with her then 17-year-old. The court was told she again mounted the kerb before driving onto the field and into the girl.

Ms Masters told the court: 'Mr Todd took hold of her, fearing for her safety.'

Joseph Spencer, mitigating, said Hall, of Low Beaumont Hill Farm in Darlington, 
did not have the easiest upbringing but now has a stable family life 
with a supportive husband and five loving children.

She was suffering severe depression 
linked to chronic fatigue syndrome at the time of the incident, for 
which she is now being treated.

Mr Spencer said: 'Miss Hall is very regretful of the action of herself that day but your honour may feel the circumstances that led up to this, i.e. her medical condition, don't justify but give a good explanation.'

Judge George Moorhouse also banned her from driving for a year and she must pass an extended test before getting back behind the wheel.

He said: 'You lost your temper on this occasion, I accept you were provoked but this is a serious offence.

'Sending your car in the direction of children and staff must have been a frightening experience for them.'

A
spokesperson for the school said: 'We are pleased this matter has now 
reached its conclusion and believe the sentence clearly shows that the 
individual's actions were out of proportion.'
