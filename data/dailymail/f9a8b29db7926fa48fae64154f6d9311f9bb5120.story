An Illinois man kept at a secure psychiatric hospital since 1993 after he decapitated his co-worker and put the victim's head on display, has asked to be allowed out for day trips.

Michael Bethke was 28 when he beheaded Joseph Lesinski Jr at the White Hen Pantry in June 1991, and reportedly scrawled the word 'repent' in blood on the head.

He claimed to be suffering from hallucinations that commanded him to kill, but hospital staff say Bethke has made significant progress and should be allowed out on supervised visits.

Held: Michael Bethke has been kept at the secure Elgin Mental Health Center after decapitating a coworker

A court had denied previous attempts to allow Bethke, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity, to leave the grounds of the secure hospital.

On June 6, 1991, Michael Bethke used a butcher's knife to decapitate his coworker Joseph Lesinski at the White Hen Pantry in Burnham, Illinois.

Bethke, who was 28 at the time, struck as his victim bent over to pick up a carton of cigarettes, and is said to have lopped off the head in one move.

He wrote the word 'repent' in blood on his victim's head and left it, as if on display, in the glass counter of the deli.

After wandering in nearby woodland for a few hours, Bethke approached a group of people and told them to call police. 

He claimed he was suffering from 'command hallucinations' that ordered him to kill.

In 1993 he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and ordered to be held at the secure Elgin Mental Health Center.

He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.

Staff at the Elgin Mental Health Center want the killer to be allowed to go on supervised visits to places like the mall.

The
 trial court in 2012 said it wasn't convinced Bethke 'will not be a risk
 to himself and others if allowed into the general public', according to the Southtown Star.

Bethke
 has appealed the decision, with a ruling filed Thursday that says the 
court must elaborate on why it believes he is a risk.

In court documents filed in 2012, Bethke is said to have made 'substantial progress' in the 20 years spent at the facility.

'He accepted his mental illness and recognized his need to stay medicated,' it stated.

It added that he still experienced paranoia and voices telling him he was evil, especially if he was exposed to news of mass disasters. 

After the 2005 tsunami in Asia he 
reportedly was aggressive to another patient, and now uses 'limited 
media exposure' to control his reactions to such events.

When
 it denied his 2012 request to leave the hospital, the trial court said 
it was concerned that the patient could have relapses, even while 
medicated, if exposed to a traumatic event.

It
 added: 'There was no indication that trained staff would be present to 
effectively handle the relapse given defendant's large size and apparent
 strength.'

At his sentence hearing in 1993 Bethke was ordered to spend up to 49 years at a state mental facility, after being diagnosed with a schizoaffective disorder.

The case will be sent to the lower court but it is believed to be unlikely that a trial court will allow the supervised visits.
