A driver who killed a female pedestrian had been warned by a psychic he would be going to prison, a court heard today.

Ashleigh Ryan, 26, is accused of mowing down care worker Tara Mackie, 25, as she walked home from work.

A court heard Ryan told a witness at the scene of the fatal crash: 'I've killed her - I'm the most unlucky person ever.

He said: 'I went to see a psychic last year who told me I would be wearing a uniform.

'It was a prison uniform. I will be going to prison for this.

'My back wheels locked, I saw a brick wall coming towards me and swerved then I hit the girl.'

Miss Mackie was walking home from her nightshift at a care home when she was hit from behind by Ryan's Ford Fiesta on a sharp bend.

Prosecutor Leuan Bennett said: 'His speed had been inappropriate for the section of road.

'There is a warning of a right hand bend and the word "slow" is written in two places on the road surface.

Cardiff Crown Court heard Ryan told a witness at the scene of the fatal crash: 'I've killed her - I'm the most unlucky person ever'

'But he entered the corner at speed and his car collided with part of a brick parapet of a bridge.

'He drove at 50mph into a brick wall and having struck it, veered out of control onto the grass verge where Tara Mackie was walking.'

Ryan, of Barry, near Cardiff, was arrested at the scene and told officers that he had swerved to avoid hitting a cyclist.

Mr Bennett added: 'He deliberately misused the history of events to blame other road users for causing this fatal crash.'

Ryan denies causing death by dangerous or careless driving.

The trial, at Cardiff Crown Court, continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
