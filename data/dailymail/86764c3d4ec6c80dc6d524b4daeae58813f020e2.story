A disabled pensioner has been left with two months' worth of rubbish because bin men refuse to climb the three steps outside his house to collect it.

Former delivery man Wilson Burdis, 67, who suffers from a severe lung complaint, said his bin has not been emptied for eight weeks due to 'health and safety' reasons.

Mr Burdis, from Morley, near Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: 'They're telling me they're not allowed to take it down the three steps to the street for health and safety reasons. I just think it's ridiculous.

Wilson Burdis, 67, said he has been left with two months' worth of garden waste because council workers refuse to collect it due to 'health and safety'

'I used to have to carry fridges, washing machines and all sorts up and down steps. If I'd ever have made that kind of excuse I'd have been laughed at.'

Mr Burdis, who lives with his wife Jean, 68, said the household rubbish from his green and black bins is collected because the refuse teams simply take the bags out of the bins.

However, the pensioner was told by bin collectors that he would have to take the brown bin - which holds garden waste - down the steps to street level himself before it could be collected.

Due to his lung condition, he is unable to lift the bin and so has been left with a build-up of rotting waste. 

'I've lived here for about eight years and it hasn't been a problem before,' he said of the bin collectors.

The pensioner, from Morley, near Leeds, West Yorkshire, claims Leeds City Council bin collectors told him he needed to move the brown bin down three steps for it to be collected, but he is unable to due to a disability

Leeds City Council said a 'one-off' special arrangement had now been made to clear the backlog of waste.

A spokesman said: 'Mr Burdis moved to a bag collection for his household and recyclable waste collection last year but at the time we did not review his garden waste collection - for which we apologise.

'We understand he is unable to take his wheeled bin to the kerbside so we have now spoken to him to offer a suitable alternative arrangement and we have also organised a one-off recovery collection in the next few days.'
