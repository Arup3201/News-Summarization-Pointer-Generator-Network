A British adventurer bidding to row across the North Pacific Ocean has told of the terrifying moment her boat capsized in the dark, bringing back awful memories of her failed attempt the previous year.

Sarah Outen, 28, has spent the last six days stuck in her tiny cabin, often strapped to her bed in case her rowing boat capsizes again.

She is attempting, for the second time, to become the first person to row single handed the 4,500 nautical miles across the North Pacific Ocean from Japan to Canada. Her attempt last year was cut short after it was hit by the Tropical Storm Mawar.

Human
power: Sarah is pictured leaving Choshi Marina, Japan, in April for her
six month trip. If she completes the challenge she will become the 
first person to row single handed from Japan to Canada

Sarah shaved her hair for the trip and suffered seasickness early on. She trained for months for the voyage

Speaking from her cabin in the middle of the North Pacific Ocean, Sarah, from Oakham, Rutland, told MailOnline she was hoping the weather would change today to allow her to resurface from her cabin and continue rowing.

She said: 'It's been a challenge so 
far. I always knew it would be a challenge to come back, both 
emotionally and also physically.

'This ocean is a big, rough old ocean and I have certainly had my fair share of rough water so far.'

The audacious attempt is in fact part of an even bigger challenge to loop the planet, using human power only, in her London2London: Via the World expedition.

She embarked on the challenge in April 2011 and the first year saw her cycle and kayak more than 11,000 miles from London to Choshi, Japan.

But last year her attempt to row solo across the North Pacific Ocean had to be abandoned after her boat Gulliver was badly damaged after being battered by 15 metre high waves and 80mph winds in the tropical storm.

The 28-year-old is the first woman and the youngest person to row solo across the Indian Ocean which she completed in 2009

She then spent nine months back home preparing to take on the challenge again and on April 27 she set off from Japan in her second bid to complete the six-month journey.

Sarah, from Oakham, Rutland, said she had rowed 1,100 miles east of Japan in just over a month at sea in her new boat, Happy Socks.

She still has about 3,200 miles to go before she reaches Canada, but has already capsized twice.

She said: 'The first time was a bit of a relief actually because I was very nervous about it.

'Last year I capsized 20 times and it was really a frightening experience to be in the cabin with the water coming in, so I was quite nervous about it.'

All
alone: She plots her journey from her cabin. She stores six months 
worth of food on board and uses a desalination machine to convert 
seawater into drinking water to cook, drink and wash

causes - CoppaFeel!, The Jubilee Sailing Trust, MNDA and WaterAid

But while she may have been 'relieved' to survive the first capsizing, it was a much more frightening experience when her boat overturned for a second time this week.

She said: 'Two nights ago I capsized in the dark and that really shook me up and brought back lots of memories of last year.

'This last week has been really quite rough weather and the wind has been blowing from the east, so it means it's both dangerous and I can't row in the direction I want to, so it's been pushing me back to Japan, which means I have been consigned to the cabin for the last six days.

'And when it's rough, in case you capsize, you have to strap yourself to the bed, so I have literally been laid down for six days, strapped to my bed which has been really quite uncomfortable.'

Rescue:
Sarah first attempted the row in May last year, but the challenge was 
cut short when she hit a typhoon several hundred miles off the coast of 
Japan. She is pictured here being rescued by the Japanese coastguard

She was forced to abandon her boat Gulliver after being battered by 15 metre high waves and 80mph winds

Rescuers help Sarah to safety after her boat capsized more than 20 times and suffered irreparable damage

But she was hoping to be able to start rowing again today as the weather was due to change.

She said: 'That is the good thing about being out here, it's a really good reminder that nothing lasts forever - you get some weather coming in but it will change after a few days.

'It looks like I should be able to start rowing again tomorrow.

'I'm definitely looking forward to having a good stretch and eating some cooked food.

Sarah is aiming to raise more than £100,000 in sponsorship for her good causes - CoppaFeel!, The Jubilee Sailing Trust, MNDA and WaterAid.
