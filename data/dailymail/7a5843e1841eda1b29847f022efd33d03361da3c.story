As a former air force officer, patriotic Larry Taylor wouldn't normally fly the U.S. flag upside down.

But the Oregon resident is so furious at the Obama presidency, he has hung the Old Glory above his home with the stripes on top and stars at the bottom - the traditional signal of distress.

Now the bold political move has sparked a war of words among Taylor's Airport Rd, Pendleton, neighbors who believe the protest is sacrilegious.

'He's a communist Muslim': Larry Taylor is flying the U.S. flag upside down to protest President Barack Obama, pictured, who he describes as a 'communist'

Taylor, 71, told East Oregonian he and his wife Carol, 73,
haven’t liked President Barack Obama since he came into 
office in 2008.

About a month ago, they began flying the flag upside down in a move generally considered bad flag etiquette.

According to the U.S Flag Code, flags should only be displayed upside down when there is extreme danger to life or property.

'We have a fraud in the White House that is a communist Muslim,' Taylor said.

'I think that constitutes a nation in distress.'

Protest: Protestors fly flags upside down to signal political dissatisfaction, although it was traditionally done by ships in distress

The Taylors said they've been bombarded with calls and complaints from their neighbors, including Brad Wahl.

Wahl, who serves in the Army National Guard, said  he first noticed the flag on his way to work at the Eastern Oregon Regional Airport, and thought someone accidentally hoisted it incorrectly.

The 37-year-old was shocked to discover is was intentional.

He said he might agree with Larry Taylor’s politics but not the method of protest.

'To me, there are certain things that 
are sacred,' Wahl told East Oregonian.

'To me, the flag is one of the things that 
people should hold with a little more regard.'

He said the upside-down flag was a way 
ships at sea or forts under attack could show they needed help, but that
 went out of fashion with new technology.

But Taylor, who claims he served in the U.S. Air Force at Homestead Air Reserve Base on the south tip of Florida from 1960-64 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, said he would prefer to fly the flag the right way. 

He promised that wouldn’t happen while Obama was in power.
