A transgender man who gave birth after transitioning from being female--complete with breast tissue removal surgery--now breastfeeds his children using a special tube and donated milk.

Trevor MacDonald of Winnipeg, Canada actually supplements what little milk his breasts can still produce with the donated stuff by feeding it through a tube that leads to the baby nursing at his breast. 

MacDonald and his partner Ian had their first baby in 2012 while McDonald took a break from testosterone therapy. That's when he learned he could still lactate some, but needed a little help from a device called a supplemental nursing system.

MacDonald is an outspoken advocate for trans parents and has created a large following for his blog on trans pregnancy and trans nursing Milk Junkies. He showed off his latching skills to HuffPost Live

Technological solution: MacDonald uses an SNS, which feeds milk toward the nipple on which the baby feeds

He explained how and SNS works in Huffington Post blog from the time:

'An SNS is a bottle with a tube going into it. You put one end of the tube next to your nipple and then latch the baby onto your nipple and the tube at the same time. 

'This way, the baby gets both the milk that the parent can produce and supplement from the bottle at once.'

It wasn't easy at first. MacDonald said it took three people to properly position their baby Jacob in the first weeks.

'We struggled through the exhaustion of sitting up through nursing sessions day and night,' he wrote. Now, he writes, 'I can nurse him to sleep when he is overtired, or latch him on to calm him when he's had an unfortunate adventure with the corner of a coffee table. Nursing has taken on dimensions that I never imagined would be possible for us.'

Things improved so much, in fact, that MacDonald and his partner recently went through the process all over again--they had their second child just weeks ago.

'In the second pregnancy, I had virtually zero experiences socially and medically,' MacDonald told HuffPost.

Since his first pregnancy, MacDonald has maintained a very successful blog devoted to educating trans parents and potential trans parents about birth and breastfeeding called Milk Junkies.
