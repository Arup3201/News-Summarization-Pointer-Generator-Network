Guilty: Sir Young, 20, (pictured) admitted to raping a 14-year-old girl at a Texas high school in 2011 when he was 18

A Texas judge has sparked national outrage after implying a 14-year-old rape victim was promiscuous and was not 'the victim she claimed to be'.

State District Judge Jeanine Howard this week stunned the court by sentencing self-confessed rapist, Sir Young, to a mild 45-day prison term and five year probation, instead of the maximum 20-year jail stint.

Young, 20, pleaded guilty to raping the 
girl at Booker T. Washington High School, Dallas, in 2011 when he was 
18, even as she cried out 'no' and 'stop'.

While Young will be labeled a sex offender for life, Howard exempted him from standard sex offender restrictions: he doesn't have to stay away from children, attend sex offender treatment, undergo a sex offender evaluation or refrain from watching pornography.

Howard told Dallas News she issued the light sentence based partially on medical records which indicated the girl had three sexual partners and had given birth to a baby. She also described Young as 'not your typical sex offender'.

'My job is not to make people happy. My job is to follow the Constitution and do the right thing. I will always do the right thing,' she said.

However the ruling has shocked and devastated the victim, now 17, who denies having ever been pregnant.

'I have never been pregnant ever,' she told WFAA. 'And three partners? I don’t even know where she got this. I feel like this was her way of trying to make herself feel better.'

She said she was just starting to come to terms with the rape and her decision to prosecute her attacker, until she heard Howard's comments.

'It was a slap in the face,' she said. 'I thought I was going to get help. I thought that it would be taken care of, and I wouldn’t have to worry about it anymore.'

She had testified during the trial that she said 'no' and 'stop' during the assault and had only wanted to kiss him.

The victim also said she regrets coming forward about the 2011 assault.

'I did what I was supposed to do. I went to the law about this situation,' she said. '(But the sentence) that says everything I went through was for nothing.'

She added: 'It would have been better for me not to say anything.

Young, meanwhile, testified last week that he is engaged and his fiancée is pregnant. They plan to get married on her birthday in November, according to Dallas News. He also reportedly is about to start a new job.

Although Judge Howard publicly declared her sentence was appropriate, she has been criticized by parts of the legal community and advocates for sexual assault victims.

Her requirement that Young complete community service at a local rape crisis sentence has caused particular outrage.

Bobbie Villareal, executive director of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center, said she refuses to welcome Young.

'I’m sure she (jUDGE Howard) probably thought that it was his way of giving back perhaps,' she told WFAA.

'But it’s just not an appropriate place for him to do his community supervision.'

Villareal slammed the 'lenient' conditions passed down by Judge Howard, who is known in legal circles for her creative approach to sentencing.

'It is a deterrent to all survivors when you see a very lenient sentence like this passed down,' Villareal told WFAA.

'It sends a devastating message to survivors of sexual assault. That victim’s family definitely didn’t feel like there was justice for her and for other survivors of sexual assault.'

Young's sentence of deferred adjudication probation means that if he meets various terms laid down by Judge Howard, he will not have a permanent criminal record.

As well as the community service order, he must also spend 45 days in jail, as well as a further 24 hours in jail every October 4 - the date of the rape - for the duration of his probation.

Howard removed herself from the case on Friday, and a new judge has taken over.

During the trial, the court heard that Young and the girl were kissing in a practice room at the performing arts school, but that she had told him to stop when he began rubbing her body.

Ignoring her pleas, he instead pulled off her leggings and raped her.

'I didn’t want to do anything other than kiss,' the victim told the court, adding that she had told Young 'no' and 'stop' before and during the attack.

Booker T. Washington High School has since added a window to the room and installed CCTV cameras.
