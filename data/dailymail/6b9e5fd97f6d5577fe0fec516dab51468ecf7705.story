An icebound convoy in Alaska is in nearly the same position it was a day ago, despite efforts to extricate it from the ice so it can deliver fuel to the capital, nearly 100 miles away.

Because of strong currents from the Bering Sea and thick ice, the vessels moved through 56 miles of the sea Tuesday, but made minimal progress Tuesday, only advancing 50 feet. Its progress is being aided by a 2.5-pound drone, which flies overhead and sends information to scientists on shore.

When the Russian tanker Renda – which is carrying 1.3million gallons of fuel for Nome – arrives at its destination, it will still have to face a 25-foot pressure ridge that is blocking the entrance to the harbour.

The camera-equipped drone looks like a smoke detector with wings and legs. It glides on 20-minute missions ranging from 10 feet to 320 feet above the ice, and its images can be instantly viewed on a tablet-type computer screen.

It has sent back images that are being analysed at the University of Anchorage, where researchers hope to guide the ships on the most successful route.

Once the ships make it to Nome, the other obstacle awaiting them is a 25-foot ice ridge. Though it extends well down into the ocean, geophysicists say the ice won’t prevent the 370-foot tanker from delivering the much-needed fuel, though it won’t be able to dock.

The tanker is equipped with a hose more than a mile long for offloading and the icebreaker is creating a path for the tanker in ice that is up to three feet thick.

If successful, the shipment would mark the first time petroleum products have been delivered by sea to a Western Alaska community in winter.

Jason Evans, chairman of Sitnasuak Native Corporation, the company arranging the delivery, said the mission remains challenging.

'I think there continues to be a lot of pressure on the ice, so when they break the ice it wants to immediately squeeze together, or the broken ice wants to shoot back into the hole they just made,' he said Tuesday.

Slow and unsteady: During the winter months, the ice is around three feet thick. The ships must also fight the strong currents of the Bering Sea

Shifting ice, described as dynamic ice, has slowed the progress of the paired vessels.

The ice tends to close in, cutting off the path between the two ships. When that happens, the icebreaker doubles back and makes a relief cut to take pressure off the tanker and open a pathway.

'I think they continue to do well with the circumstances,' Mr Evans said.

He said the tanker and the icebreaker were expected to go through a large section of thinner ice and then encounter thicker ice again near Nome.

Without the gasoline delivery, Nome could run short of fuel before a barge delivery becomes possible in late spring.

Clearing the way: The Russian tanker Renda moves slowly through the cracked sea ice in a path made by the Coast Guard icebreaker the Healy

Stuck: Ice flows about a foot thick have trapped the Renda, forcing the Healy to turn around the free the tanker before they can move forward

A massive storm prevented the town of 3,500 on the northwestern coast of Alaska from receiving its last delivery of supplies before it was socked in by the unspeakable winter cold.

The town could run out of the fuel it needs to heat and power homes, vehicles, hospitals and schools.

If the mission is successful, it will be the first time petroleum products have been delivered by sea to a Western Alaska community in winter.

The Coast Guard said the Russian tanker came upon ice about a foot thick very early Friday near Nunivak Island, a large island in the eastern Bering Sea.

Last chance: The tanker is carrying 1.3 million gallons of fuel that could not make it to Nome before winter because of a massive storm

Much needed supplies: If the tanker doesn't reach Nome this winter, the village might run out of supplies

Surrounded: The Renda, which is a 350-foot tanker, can steam through sea ice on its own, as long as it's not too thick

The Coast Guard icebreaker should have no problem getting through the ice even if it becomes several feet thick, said Coast Guard Petty Officer First Class David Mosley.

'In the worst-case scenario, it might stop and back up and ram their way through the pressure ridges, where it gets really thick,' he said. 

However, conditions are so cold that the ice quickly freezes around the tanker, requiring the Healy to back up and free it.

Additionally, maneuvering is a problem. The tanker must stay close enough to its Coast Guard escort that the lanes through the ice freeze back over.

However, that distance puts the two vessels at risk of slamming into each other.

This means that progress is exceptionally slow during the long, dark nights, which last most of the day close to the Article Circle.

Long way: The ships encountered the ice near Nanivak Island, about 300 miles from its destination of Nome Alaska
