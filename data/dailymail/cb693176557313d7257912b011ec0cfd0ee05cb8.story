When it was first built Queen Victoria was on the throne and the Great War was still 15 years off.

But, a team of British motor enthusiasts are attempting to get an iconic 114-year-old Panhard et Levassor back on the road and make it pass its MOT.

The dark-blue French-built machine was commissioned and made for motoring pioneer Charles 
Rolls, who went on to co-found the world-famous Rolls-Royce company.

It was made in 1899 and is one of the oldest working cars in Britain, having spent 77 years in this country.

The engineers have been working since 1991, and are now based at Gressenhall Farm and Workhouse, near Dereham.

They believe the car may be road worthy again in less than a month.

The leader of Team Panhard, Phil Waltham, wants the car to be kept in full working order so 
that the public can see a rare, genuine Victorian car in all its glory.

He said: 'We feel it's a great
privilege to be involved with the car and to play a part in preserving 
it for the future'.

'When the car is going along the road it is nothing like a model, so we think people should get the chance to see it.'

Built in Paris, the Panhard was the 
first vehicle of its kind to have its engine positioned at the front of 
the car, putting it at the cutting edge of 19th century technology.

The biggest obstacle for the team has been the discovery of a cracked chassis last year, which threatened to finally stop 
the classic car after well over a century of running smoothly.

But the team have invested more than 200 hours of work to repair it and ensure the car passes next month's MOT.

The
splintered chassis was replaced with ash heart wood by 53-year-old 
Andrew Curtis, from Herts, who said that above all, the team do not want
the Panhard to become a relic.

He said: 'We are striving to prevent the car becoming a static exhibition, which happens to a lot of cars unfortunately.'

Five engineers have been re-building the front beam axle which will steady out the steering, as well as re-building the steering box.'

The Panhard has been based at Gressenhall since 1996 when it was moved from Strangers Hall Museum in Norwich.

But chief engineer Ken Hilton, from Norfolk, believes that the project was worth pursuing so that the public could continue to witness a piece of history.

The 89-year-old said: 'It's so much better to keep her working so people can see a very early vehicle on the road.

'The car is only 25 years older than me.'

An 1895 Panhard motor car after having taken part in an obstacle race in Paris in 1928. the company set the standard for the industry

The French based Panhard et Levassor was established as a car manufacturing company in 1887 by by René Panhard and Émile Levassor.

Their first car launched in 1890. While their cars set many standards, using front mounted radiators and chain driven gear boxes, each one was a one off design.

In 1891, the company built their first all-Levassor deign, creating a state of the art machine that sold for 3000 Francs. It became the standard in the industry until the late 1920s.

Panhard is credited with creating the first modern transmission in 1985.

In the post war era Panhard used alumium to circumvent steel-saving government regulations. The result was light, moveable cars such as the Dyna X and PL 17.

The last Panhard passenger car was produced in 1967, as the company began to focus on armoured vehicles used by the military.

Panhard lost a competition to produce vehicles for the French military to Auverlan in 2004.

Auverland then purchased Panhard, but with Panhard's name being more famous, the new Auverland military vehicles will bear a Panhard plaque.
