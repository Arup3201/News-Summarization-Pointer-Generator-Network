The married father who was put in jail 13 years after committing a crime has spoken out one day after he was formally released.

'It's still a dream. It hasn't really sunk in yet,’ Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson said on the Today Show Tuesday morning, saying that he hasn’t slept since his release.

‘I watched my family, watching them sleeping. I just wanted to make sure I didn’t wake up from the dream.’

Reunited: Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson and his wife LaQonna spoke out on the Today Show Tuesday morning about the emotional hearing on Monday that led to his release

In awe: Anderson, 37, said that he has not slept since the release- opting to watch his family sleep instead

Anderson spent 13 years free from prison due to a clerical error, then nearly a year behind bars when the mistake was caught. On Monday, he walked out of a southeast Missouri courtroom a free man again - this time with no need to look over his shoulder.

The reunion with his wife and four children comes after 10 months apart, because he said that he did not want his kids to visit him behind bars.

‘Especially with children they're so young and impressionable… I didn’t want my children to feel that that’s normal to see that that's something that’s acceptable,’ he told Savannah Guthrie.

Anderson, now 37, was 23 when he was sentenced to 13 years in prison for his role in the robbery of a fast-food restaurant's assistant manager. He told The Associated Press last month that he waited, and even asked about going to prison, but the order never came.

A free man: A judge ordered Cornealious Anderson (left) out of jail today. He was arrested last year when it was discovered he was never sent to prison for a robbery conviction in a clerical mistake. Pictured above with wife LaQonna and daughter Nevaeh, 3, after his release today  

When asked why didn't he turn himself in, he said: 'The thought crossed my mind but once someone tells you "It's not your job to turn yourself in, it's their job to take you in..."'

'I know it sounds weird but if I had to do it all over again, I don't know if I would do anything different.'

In July, Anderson's sentence was supposed to end. It was then that someone at the Missouri Department of Corrections realized he had never been put behind bars. Eight U.S. marshals arrived one morning at his home in a middle-class neighborhood and took him away. He was in prison by noon that day, and had remained behind bars until Monday.

Anderson and his wife credit God for getting them through the process.

Emotional: Once he returned to the family home on Monday, that was the first time he had seen his four children in over 10 months because he wouldn't allow them to visit while he was in jail

Celebration: The relatives that were in the court room at the time of the verdict broke down in sobs while those at home broke out the silly string

Changed man: In his 13 years of freedom, Anderson got married, had children, started a construction business, coached his son's youth football team and volunteered at his church

‘His hand was in this the whole time,’ Anderson said.

‘(Having Anderson home), the feeling is just great. I missed by husband, I missed by best friend,’ LaQonna Anderson said.

In addition to the judge, the man who owned the fast food restaurant that Anderson robbed has also praised his self-improvement over the past 13 years and pushed for his release.

‘It’s about  time they let the guy go home. It’s the state's screw up, not his,’ the man said in a statement.

‘That’s awesome. That in itself is enough for me. It lets you know his character,’ Anderson said.

Mississippi County Associate Circuit Judge Terry Lynn Brown needed just a 10-minute hearing before ruling that he was giving Anderson credit for time served for all 4,794 days between his conviction and when he was arrested last year.

Mistake: If he served his full sentence, Anderson would have been released last July. That's when authorities realized the clerical error and brought him to prison

The judge granted Anderson his 
immediate freedom, and he left the courthouse with his wife and 
3-year-old daughter on one arm, his grandmother on the other, tears in 
all of their eyes.

 37, left the courthouse with his wife and 3-year-old daughter on one

'Very
 happy,' Anderson said as he climbed into a sport utility vehicle for 
the ride home to suburban St. Louis and a planned family celebration.

'My faith has always been in God. I'm just so thankful. I just thank God for everybody.'

‘I’m
 going to enjoy every moment that I can: with real food and a real bed, 
just enjoy these guys,’ he said as he was welcomed home by his children.

Justice: Anderson walks out of court victorious today with wife LaQonna and daughter Neveah

Anderson, who had never 
been convicted of a serious crime before the robbery, suspected his case
 had been overlooked and asked his former attorney what to do.

'Day
 by day, month by month, year by year, time passed, and they never 
picked me up,' he said in an interview last month with The Associated 
Press.

So Anderson went about his life, never trying to conceal his whereabouts or identity.

He
 married, divorced, married again. He raised three children of his own 
and a stepchild, owned and operated three construction businesses. He 
coached his son's youth football team in Webster Groves, and he ran the 
video operation at his church.

The hearing was in Charleston, Missouri, because that's where Anderson had been imprisoned.

'Go home to your family, Mr. Anderson,' Brown said after his ruling.
