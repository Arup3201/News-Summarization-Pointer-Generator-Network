The bodies of a young family of three were found in a picturesque lakeside village in Switzerland today following a shooting.

Police were called to a car park between a school and the railway station in Wilderswil at around 7am.

'Loud bangs were heard around half an hour earlier,' said a local resident, who added: 'It appears that a man may have killed his wife and child before turning his gun on himself.'

All of the victims lived in Wilderswil and were Swiss nationals. 

Local mayor Marianna Lehmann said: 'This is an absolute tragedy for all of us. It is an extremely sad day.' 

She said screens had been placed across the scene of the crash to prevent schoolchildren from seeing what had happened.
