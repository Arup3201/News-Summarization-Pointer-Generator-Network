Two men have been charged with attempted murder after allegedly trying to carve a tattoo from their housemate's arm before setting him on fire, officials have said.

Paul Hurst, 33, and Cary Edwards, 35, reportedly savagely beat up 31-year-old Zachary Swanson following an argument at their home in Hebron in Wicomico County, Maryland.

They then unsuccessfully tried to forcibly remove a tattoo from his arm, before dousing his arm with a flammable liquid and setting it alight, it is claimed.

Mr Swanson was taken to Peninsula Regional Medical Center and was later airlifted to a Baltimore burn center.

He remains there in a critical condition with 'extensive' injuries, including severe burns, Wicomico County Sheriff Mike Lewis said in a statement.

Mr Lewis said Mr Swanson had been 'savagely beaten and nearly killed by two cohabitants' during the assault in the early hours of Monday morning.

He was then reportedly left on the ground without medical treatment for several hours, before being driven to the hospital in Salisbury.

Investigators
 believe those involved in the incident may be affiliated with Juggalos,
 a cult fan base of the rap-metal duo Insane Clown Posse.

Officials said Mr Swanson's tattoo was consistent with the cult, which is deemed a 'loosely organised gang' by the FBI.

The Wicomico Bureau of Investigation is investigating the incident, while detectives are executing a search warrant on the trio's house and the vehicle used to transport Mr Swanson to hospital.

Hurst, of Hebron, and Edwards, of Williamsburg, Virginia, were arrested on Monday.

They have each been charged with attempted first-degree and second-degree murder, first-degree and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and use of a deadly weapon.

Juggalos are fans of the rap-metal duo Insane Clown Posse or another Psychopathic Records hip hop group.

They have developed their own slang and characteristics, including drinking and spraying the soft drink Faygo, carrying hatchets, listening to 'horrorcore 'and wearing clown or corpse face paint.

Juggalos and the artists they support hold a festival, dubbed 'The Gathering of the Juggalos', every year, which attracts more than 100,000 fans.

The cult fan base has been deemed a 'loosely organised gang' by the FBI.
