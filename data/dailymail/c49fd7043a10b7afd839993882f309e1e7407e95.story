A signature from the past has been unearthed in Jerusalem having laid hidden for nearly three millennia.

Archaeologists have discovered a stone seal during meticulous excavations under a drainage base next to the Western Wall of the Temple Mount in the Israeli city.

The semi-precious stone seal is thought to date back to the end of Temple period and is engraved with the words Matanyahu Ben Ho which means 'giving to God' in Hebrew.

Sign of the times: Archaelogists have discovered this small stone 
engraved with the name 'Matanayahu'. They believe it was used to stamp
letters with the owners mark 2,700 years ago

It is believed that the small stone was probably originally set in a signet ring and used as a personal seal by its owner so they could sign letters with it.

From the start of the excavations in this area archaeologists decided that all of the soil removed from the area would be sifted very carefully using a process called wet sifting.

The dig is being carried out in cooperation with thousands of pupils in the Tzurim Valley National Park and it was during the sieving process that the tiny seal was discovered.

Names like matanyahu were typical of those used in the Kingdom of Judah in latter part of the First Temple period - from the end of the eighth century BC until the destruction of the Temple in 586 BC.

To find a seal from the First Temple period at the foot of the Temple Mount walls is said to be extremely rare.

Shards
of pottery characteristic of the period were also found on the floor in
the ancient building beneath the base of the drainage channel, as well 
asÂ  evidence of a fire.

Unearthed: The discovery of the ancient seal was made near the Western Wall in Jerusalem
