The Miss World 2014 contest saw 120 international contestants each deemed to be not only the most beautiful in their home countries, but the best example of what it means to be a modern woman, descend on London last weekend.

While they looked perfectly polished and relaxed as they took to the runway to dazzle the judges at the grand finale on Sunday, the rest of the week was an altogether different affair.

As these behind-the-scenes photos reveal, the contestants endured gruelling fitness tests, intense talent rounds and gorged on plenty of burgers and chips.

Adrian Fisk, the official photographer of the Miss World Competition, this year held in London, explains that he wanted to show the day-to-day lives of the girls who competing for the prestigious title. 

His photo series documents the women arriving in London from all around the globe, waiting nervously behind the scenes and even celebrating contestants' birthdays.

Speaking about his work, he said: 'Being the official photographer for Miss World has not only been an honour but also truly inspiring. I think like many people my perception of Miss World was girls parading around in bikinis wanting world peace. 

'The truth, it turns out, is far from that. Each one of these woman are determined, passionate, motivated, bright and an inspiration to young woman and youth around the world. Take each one of their 'Beauty with a purpose' charity projects and you can see their intelligence and determination in trying to create change for a better world. 

'Over these past four weeks I have seen them dance with extraordinary agility, perform fitness tests and sports competitions that left me exhausted just watching them, watch them debate against some of the sharpest young minds in the country at the Oxford Union hall on the concept of Miss World in the 21st century and finally keep a steady nerve as they prepared to enter a competition watched live by just short of a billion people. I have nothing but respect for each and every one of them.'

The coveted crown was taken home by Miss South Africa, Rolene Strauss. She was presented the glittering accolade by last year's winner, Megan Young of the Philippines.

The 22-year-old, who is studying medicine at the University of the Free State, proved that she is both beauty and brains. 

Her first runner up was Miss Hungary, Edina Kulcsar, and second runner up was Miss United States, Elizabeth Safrit. 

This year's crop, far from being the stereotypical dumb beauty queens, were both pretty and polished, with the majority holding a university degree, as well as juggling a vast array of interests, hobbies and charity work.

This year's event has been rocked by the murder of Miss Honduras, 19-year-old Maria Jose Alvarado, who was shot dead along with her sister last month.

Police in Honduras accuse her sister's boyfriend of shooting them after seeing his partner dancing with another man at a party.

Strauss and other contestants will travel to the crime-plagued central American nation to build a school named in the sisters' honour.

'We hope that it will really start to impress on the people in Honduras that the violence, and hurting people like those two innocent women... maybe they can think again before they take a gun,' Miss World chairwoman Julia Morley told AFP.

Sunday's show started with a spectacular choreographed dance routine, with all the beauty queens on stage in costumes inspired by their homelands - including Miss Bolivia in a colourful feathered headdress.

While beauty remains central to the event, the women taking part are chiefly judged on their talents and involvement in good causes.

Venezuela tops the all-time leader board with six titles, ahead of India and the United Kingdom on five titles each.

Julia Morley, Miss World Chairman, said: 'It was great to bring the 64th Miss World Final back to London and where it all began 63 years ago.

'I’m looking forward to travelling with Rolene, the new Miss World, to visit countries around the globe to support this year’s finalists Beauty with a Purpose fundraising projects.'
