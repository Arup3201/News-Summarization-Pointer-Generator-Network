Champions Dulwich withstood a second-half comeback from London rivals Hampton to keep on track for another triumphant day at Twickenham.

Dulwich produced a mix of sharp attacking play and fierce defence to pip Hampton who dominated the second half after falling 8-0 behind.

The way Dulwich played in the first half they looked set for a comfortable victory only to run out of steam in a highly-entertaining encounter at Broadstreet, the Coventry-based club who host the semi-finals in the world's biggest rugby tournament for schools.

As a frantic second half unfolded, Hampton tried to take advantage of sin bin offences for Dulwich forwards Billy Mostyn and Jeremy Reason.

For a short period, Dulwich were reduced to 13 men and Hampton engineered a try for captain Alex Lundberg off a line-out drive. Fly half Tom MccGwire missed the conversion.

Hampton looked set to dominate only for Dulwich to increase their lead again, thanks to a second penalty from centre Dom Fraser.

Dulwich had played their best rugby in the first half and led from the 13th minute when Fraser landed his first penalty goal.

Some excellent team play, including Dulwich’s trademark forward drives, eventually cracked open the Hampton defence in the 20th minute, full-back Ali Neden speeding on to Fraser’s pass to score in the left corner.

Fraser missed the conversion but Dulwich’s 8-0 lead proved significant as the match unfolded, Hampton finding their rhythm.

Dulwich spent the vast majority of the second half on the defence, successfully snuffing out repeated Hampton attacks.

Centre Alex Taverner looked certain to score only for referee Dean Richards to adjudge that the Hampton player had been held up by Dulwich defenders.

‘It was the classic game of two halves,’ smiled a relieved Dulwich coach Sam Howard afterwards. ‘It’s a cliché but true.

‘In the second half we just forget how to attack and decided to defend. We did manage to grab three points when we were down to 14 men and that proved crucial. Overall, it was a good game and a credit to both teams. ‘

Fraser accepted the combined tackle by captain Dom Wroe Wright and Neden on Taverner had been a big turning point. ‘That was a great moment and epitomised our team and the way we play for each other,’ he said.

A dramatic late surge in the second half secured Northampton Schools for Boys a first appearance in a Twickenham final.

Warwick led 10-0 early in the second half of a nervous contest and looked set to continue in the footsteps of the school’s 2007 team who beat Barnard Castle in the final.

But NSB ultimately proved stronger after overcoming a spate of handling errors which had ruined a number of attacks.

Warwick were 3-0 ahead at half-time, thanks to a penalty by full-back Joshua Hickman, and extended the lead three minutes after the break when scrum-half Andrew Rusher galloped clear off an interception near halfway.

Hickman converted to give Warwick a 10-0 lead which was reduced by Bullivant’s first penalty, the fly half having missed two kicks in the first half.

That taste of success gave Bullivant new confidence and he led NSB’s resurgence in the closing stages which culminated in him helping to set up Hartfield’s try, the flanker wriggling clear of Warwick defenders. Bullivant converted to level the match at 10-10. To add to Warwick’s worries No 16 Kurt Jenkins was sin binned soon afterwards and a further penalty, a minute later, brought the fly half’s winning kick.

Mark Lee, the long-serving head of rugby at NSB, said he feared his team were stumbling to defeat when they went 10-0 down.

‘We were starting to think it was a ‘bridge too far’ but we had to get on that scoreboard. Warwick are a good side but I never thought they were going to carve us up out wide.

‘We just needed to get some points in order to develop some confidence. We looked brilliant over on the back field in the warm up, but as soon as the opposition came on all that changed,’ he joked.

‘But the way we fought back was testimony to this side’s guts and determination. A Twickenham final is just fantastic.’ As a state school, NSB will be looking to become the first from the sector since Exeter College in 2005 to lift the Under 18s Cup.
