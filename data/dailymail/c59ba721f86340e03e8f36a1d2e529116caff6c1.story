Koala populations face a new threat - from a zip line thrill ride which is being proposed to attract more visitors to a Queensland national park if it goes ahead.

Trees in Obi Obi Gorge that will to be used to hold up the high-flying attraction located in the Sunshine Coast hinterland's Kondalilla National Park are koala habitats, environmentalists say.

National Parks Association of Queensland executive coordinator Paul Donatiu said the steel platforms needed to hold up the adventure ride and clearing vegetation to make way for the cables would hurt the habitat and rare bird species.

'This government is ignoring its duty of care to conserve rare species in our national parks, including koalas, in the name of adrenaline tourism,' he said.

The warning comes after Queensland's tourism minister, Jann Stuckey, named Australian Zip Line Canopy Tours as the project's preferred proponent.

'The hinterland business community recognises that a zipline attraction would draw more visitors and revitalise the region, which would have flow on economic benefits to the broader community,' she said.

Sunshine Coast tourism operators have welcomed the proposal.

Hinterland tourism president Christine Kardash said the  zip line attract more people to the park.

The zip line will be located in Kondalilla National Park. The route at the park's Obi Obi Gorge is mapped out on the right.

According to Sunshine Coast Destinations Limited, the zip line would create 50 full-time jobs and generate more than $3 million a year for the area.

It has been reported the zip-line would affect less than 0.3% of the Kondalilla National Park.

'I do think the opportunity to pass through the forest at a new "level" without actually touching the ground will be a huge drawcard,' Mr Kardash told the Hinterland Times in March.

But Mr Donatiu said the zipline, which would be a first for any Australian national park, would attract the wrong kind of visitor.

'A key aspect of ecotourism is that the tourism activity leads or adds to the conservation of the ecosystem in which it operates,' he said.

'The inclusion of an environmental educational component in the proposed zip line will do little for the national park itself, particularly as research overseas shows a strong indication that tour guests are impatient for the thrill of the ride.'

Australian Zip Line Canopy Tours have been invited to submit a more detailed proposal to show environmental checks have been incorporated into the planning, design and operation of the project and explain its financial benefits.

Koalas live mostly on the east coast of Australia, where eucalypt varieties they eat are more common
