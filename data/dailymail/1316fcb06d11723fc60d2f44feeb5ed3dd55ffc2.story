He is an ‘international security consultant’ and martial arts expert who was Diana, Princess of Wales’s bodyguard and has worked in troublespots around the world.

Now Lee Sansum is facing a new challenge – as a minder for Alex Salmond in the final, heated days of the referendum campaign as the First Minister tours Scotland.

Pictured standing discreetly, but watchfully, behind the SNP leader, Mr Sansum wears a Yes badge – but insists this is only to help him blend in with the rest of Mr Salmond’s entourage.

In 1997 Mr Sansum was Diana’s bodyguard, around a month before her death, during a family holiday to the French resort of Saint Tropez.

Despite admiring and liking his latest boss, super-fit former soldier Mr Sansum, who has worked for celebrities including Sylvester Stallone and Tom Cruise, says he has yet to make up his mind on how to vote in tomorrow’s historic referendum.

He can command high fees for risky overseas security work – but says he accepted the job protecting Mr Salmond because he wanted to contribute to Scottish political history.

In an interview with the Mail, Manchester-born Mr Sansum, 50, who lives in Elgin, Moray, said that he now works for Glasgow-based SecuriGroup which contacted him to request his services guarding Mr Salmond.

The father-of-four has black belts in karate, jujitsu and kick-boxing and says he has the fitness levels of a 21-year-old, after passing a tough US military test.

Reflecting on his work as the First Minister’s bodyguard, Mr Sansum said: ‘It was a bit unusual. I had just returned from Libya, where I was evacuating European peace-keepers on behalf of the EU.

‘The situation over there was tough. There’s still a huge amount of ordnance – shells and missiles which Gaddafi left behind – so it was dangerous 24 hours a day.

‘Brussels made the decision to pull us out, so I was helping with evacuations, and I was among the last to leave. It was quite hairy and a few vehicles were shot up.

‘My wife suggested, because I’d had a couple of close shaves, that I should perhaps find more suitable work in Scotland.

‘When I got home, the company I work for got in touch and asked if I was free to do some work for Mr Salmond and I was very happy to do it.

‘I’m not doing it for the money – I wanted to make a contribution to Scottish political history.’

Having worked in risky conditions around the world, Mr Sansum said the Scottish referendum had been relatively peaceful.

‘I spent five to six months in Libya with the UN and saw men with AK-47s outside polling stations,’ he said.

‘And polling stations were blown up if they were expected to return the wrong result – so I’m happier dodging eggs than bullets.’
