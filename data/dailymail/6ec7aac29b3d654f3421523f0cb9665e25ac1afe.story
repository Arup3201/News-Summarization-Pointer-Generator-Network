A loner who raped and murdered a British schoolgirl in a French youth hostel has been found guilty of an attempted knifepoint sex attack on a Spanish teenager.

Serial sex attacker Francisco Arce Montes, 64, was tried for the attack last Thursday after being extradited to Spain from France where he is serving a 30-year jail sentence for the July 1996 killing of British schoolgirl Caroline Dickinson.

The one-day hearing was held behind closed doors after a request from the victim's lawyer for the press and public to be kept out was accepted.

Judges at a court in Oviedo, northern Spain, today sentenced Arce Montes to another 11 years behind bars after announcing their decision to convict him in writing.

Arce Montes tried to rape his 18-year-old victim by putting a knife to her throat after tricking her into letting him in the block of flats she was holidaying at with her family by claiming he had lost his keys.

The August 22, 1997, incident occurred just over a year after he killed Cornish youngster Caroline, 13, in a Brittany youth hostel during a school trip.

A neighbour who was returning home from work foiled the attack in Llanes near Oviedo.

Arce Montes was arrested minutes later after threatening to kill Good Samaritan Miguel Llera as he fled, but later skipped bail and failed to show up for trial.

He has been held at Villabona Prison near Oviedo while judges deliberate their verdict and sentence and is now expected to lodge an appeal being returned to his French jail cell.

Javier Dominguez, head of the panel of three judges which tried Arce Montes, described him in a 10-page written ruling as an 'extremely dangerous criminal.'

He said: 'What the attacker intended was to rape his victim.

'He employed the knife with which he tried to immobilise her by putting it to her neck and showed he was more than prepared to use it with the potentially lethal consequences that could have incurred.

'This court has taken into consideration the fact that we are dealing with an individual who has been arrested for several previous sex offences and is currently serving a jail sentence for a serious incident which caused the death of his victim in France.'

Caroline was in a party of 40 pupils and five teachers on an end-of-term school trip staying at a youth hostel in Pleine Fougeres.

Former waiter Arce Montes, a drifter born in Gijon in northern Spain, raped her and then suffocated her after entering through a door thought to have been left unlocked.

He evaded capture until U.S. police arrested him over a similar attack on an Irish woman tourist in Florida in April 2001.

An immigration official at Detroit Airport discovered he was in police custody in Miami Beach after seeing a British newspaper story about the five-year anniversary of Caroline's murder in a British newspaper and doing an immigration search to see if he had ever travelled to the US.

Arce Montes' DNA was later matched to DNA samples from the Caroline Dickinson murder investigation, as well as the youth hostel attack on the Irish student and four other similar incidents on Miami Beach.

The U.S. authorities later suspended charges against Arce Montes so he could be extradited and charged over Caroline's murder.

He was sentenced to 30 years in prison by a court in Rennes in June 2004.

As well as the brutal crime against Caroline Dickinson, Arce Montes is also known to have committed assaults in Germany where he was jailed for five years in the mid-eighties for rape, and the Netherlands.

Authorities in South America also believe he killed and raped at least a dozen women within their borders, besides assaulting many more.

He is expected to serve his jail time in Spain once he has been released from prison in France, where he is currently scheduled to stay until January 2027.

A witness who testified against him last Thursday said after the hearing: 'He didn't even look at me while I gave evidence.

'He looked like he didn't care less or he already knows what to expect because he didn't appear at all nervous.'
