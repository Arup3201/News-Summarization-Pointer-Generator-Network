They may look like a group of sporty men heading for a round of golf in their brightly coloured tank tops and plus fours.

But this gang of rowdy golfers are being hunted by British Transport Police after subjecting a family to a drunken 'barrage of abuse and vile language' on a train journey.

The men had been challenged over their rowdy behaviour and bad language by the women, three generations of the same family, who were making their way back to Wales from a weekend away in London.

Wanted: CCTV images of two of the men dressed as golfers who British Transport Police want to speak to after a family were subjected to a 'barrage of abuse' on a train between Cardiff and Bridgend

'Vile language': The group of men are said to have been loud and abusive from the moment they boarded the train at Cardiff Central station

Officers have today issued CCTV pictures
of the group of colourfully dressed men travelling between Cardiff and 
Bridgend on May 18.

Seargeant Nick Brown of British Transport Police said: 'Three women were travelling home from a weekend away in London when a group of men, all aged in their early 20s, boarded the service at Cardiff Central.

'As soon as they entered the carriage, the men - all of whom appeared to be drunk - became abusive and were shouting loudly. 

'When challenged over their behaviour and
asked to mind their language, the men subjected all three victims to a 
barrage of abuse and vile language.' 

Abuse: The men, all aged in their 20s, all appeared to be drunk according to police

Intimidating: When the men were challenged by three female passengers traveling home from London they subjected them to 'vile' abuse

Sgt Brown added: 'This was an extremely distressing and intimidating experience for the victims, who were three generations of the same family simply making their way home after what had been a pleasant weekend away.

'Passengers and staff have the right to go about their business without being subjected to abusive behaviour of this type.

'I would like to appeal to the public to
come forward with any information they may have in relation to this 
incident, and particularly anyone who recognises the men in the CCTV 
images.'

Hunt: Police hope that members of the public will be able to help them identify the men involved

The incident happened on a First Great Western Train at around 9pm.

Anyone with information should contact British Transport Police on 0800 405040 quoting background reference B6/WCA of 14/06/2013.

Information can also be passed to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
