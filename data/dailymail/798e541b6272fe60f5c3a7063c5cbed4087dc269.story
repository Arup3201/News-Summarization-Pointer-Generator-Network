French police have called for the ‘systematic eviction’ of Roma from the centre of tourist Paris – provoking outrage from charity groups.

It follows Manuel Valls, the country's new prime minister, saying that the travelling communities of mainly Romanians and Bulgarians ‘cannot integrate’ and should be deported.

A strategy document written by police in the upmarket 6th arrondissement of Paris and leaked to Le Parisien newspaper calls for Roma families to be hunted ‘day and night’ and for their ‘systematic eviction’.

It has drawn disturbing parallels with the kind of edicts issued by the Nazis during the Second World War Occupation of Paris.

Gipsies were rounded up along with thousands of Jews and then sent to German concentration camps, where most were murdered.

A spokesman for Charity group Catholic Help described the note as a ‘scandal’, saying that it ‘stigmatised a poor community’ and amounted to ‘racial profiling’.

An official who works with the city’s police authority, also told Le Parisien that the note was ‘violent and illegal’.

He added: ‘This clumsy and unacceptable order stigmatises an entire group of people. What right do they have to purge them?’

But other Paris officials argue that Roma are behind a huge crime wave in the city, involving themselves in everything from aggressive begging to muggings and burglaries.

Gangs of young Roma women, including children, can regularly be seen harassing tourists around landmarks such as Notre Dame Cathedral and the Eiffel Tower.

Pierre Lecoq, mayor of the 6th arrondissement, defended the tone of the note, saying that Roma families living ‘on the street with young children’ was ‘not acceptable in human and social terms’.

He said there had been a ‘massive influx’ of Roma over the past few months, leading to the ‘number of families to triple’.

Solution: In the past, Roma and gipsy communities have been offered free travel out of France, such as here in Marseille in 2010

Jean-Pierre Colombies, spokesman for the SNOP-SCSI police union, said Roma were constantly moving around Paris.

‘It’s musical chairs’ said Mr Colombies. ‘We chase the Roma from one place to another, from one arrondissement to the next.’

Even Stephane Le Foll, spokesman for France’s Socialist Government, appeared to back the police, saying that extremely poor communities living rough in Paris made ‘everybody extremely nervous’.

Mr Le Foll said: ‘We’re obliged to regulate all that, to be clear on all that, not to consider that nothing has happened.’

Prime Minister Valls has continued a policy started by former president Nicolas Sarkozy of razing Roma camps, and trying to deport as many of their occupants as possible.

This has led to protests from a number of human rights groups, including Amnesty International, which points out that most Roma France are Romanian or Bulgarian and as such are EU citizens with the right to live and work in the country.
