Face-off: Taylor Murphy, 29, is accused of sexually assaulting his ex-lover, Claudia Charriez, pictured

A FDNY calendar boy punched, bit and spat at his blonde pre-op transsexual model girlfriend, nearly leaving her unconscious, during a vicious brawl, jurors heard today.

Taylor Murphy, 29, is accused of assaulting his ex-lover, Claudia Charriez, 31, who was kicked off American's Next Top Model in 2006 for being born a man.

In opening statements of Murphy's trial, being heard in Manhattan Supreme Court, prosecutors claimed Murphy 'grabbed her with his massive hands' during the August 2011 dispute in their room at the Hotel Metro on 35th street.

'He punched her in the back on the right side, by the shoulder blade, assistant district attorney Kevin Rooney said, according to The New York Post.

'Enough to make her fear what was coming as he slammed the door shut... the two struggled. He bit her on the forearm.

'Ultimately he pinned her down on the bed... all 240 pounds of her on top of her, into her, until she felt like she was literally engulfed by the bed.'

His voice rising, Rooney continued: 'He spit at her. Covering her mouth so she couldn't scream.'

In his opening statement, defense lawyer Jason Berland described the couple as having 'a textbook dysfunctional relationship.'

Berland told jurors that Charriez had been working as a prostitute and the love affair 'unfortunately went south' when Murphy discovered the woman was sick with 'a venereal disease.'Â 

'Because he loved her he begged her to stop working as an escort,' he said, according to The Post.

'But his pleas fell on deaf ears' and Murphy, who is bisexual and has a penchant for trannies, started seeing other people, which is when Charriez embarked on a campaign of threats and allegations against the firefighter.

But the prosecution claims the breakup and subsequent beat-down was sparked by Murphy's drunken jealousy.

On a separate evening, which ended in blows, the couple visited Times Square strip club Flashdancers where, according to The Post, Murphy wound up getting a lap dance and Charriez retaliated by chatting up patrons who mistook her for an employee.

Tempers flared and they took their dispute outside.

She called him various expletives, the prosecutor told jurors. Then started screaming 'Rape! Rape!' the defense lawyer claimed.

Murphy allegedly slammed his date into a phone booth and dragged her down the sidewalk by the hair before the pair dashed back to their room in separate cabs.

There, they eventually kissed and made up, prosecutors admitted.

'She realized she could not stop him,' Rooney said. 'She began to cry and she pulled him closer to her, then he started crying and they sat up in the room for several minutes.'

But the two made plans to see each other the next afternoon, the defense lawyer said, while Charriez' lawyers admit they did get together soon after the brawl.

Murphy is charged with felony strangulation and felony violation of an order of protection barring him from contacting his alleged victim, which he reportedly did 1,400 times in the space of three months in the form of text messages and phone calls.

The firefighter previously worked with Engine 59 and Engine 7, Ladder 1 in lower Manhattan. He is best known as Mr March in a 2011 firefighters calender.

But the FDNY said the calendar Murphy posed in was not affiliated with the department.
