Two men have cashed in on the popularity of ugly sweater parties - and the lack of garish sweaters on the market - by launching a multi-million dollar business.

Evan Mendelsohn, 30, and Nick Morton, 32, of San Diego, California, created their cheeky apparel company, Tipsy Elves, in 2011; two years later, they appeared on ABC's Shark Tank, where they won $100,000 in funding for the brand.

The pair, whose irreverent sweater designs include an image of Jesus in a party hat wearing a T-shirt that says 'birthday boy' and an illustration of Santa Claus urinating onto white snow, told Racked.com that their projected sales for 2014 are $8 million.

The two friends, who met while fraternity brothers at the University of California, San Diego, began the venture as a side project while Mr Mendelsohn was practicing law and Mr Morton was working as a dentist.

'Nick and I had been to a lot of ugly Christmas sweater parties and had difficulty finding places to buy them,' Mr Mendelsohn recalled.

They both tapped into their own savings, investing $140,000 in the business. While neither had experience selling apparel, they put in long hours to get the company off the ground.

'It was really difficult for us the first year because we were both working full-time jobs. I was coming home from work and staying up until 1 or 2 a.m. talking with suppliers in China. It was hectic, but once I saw that it went well, I was comfortable quitting my "real" job in our second year,' Mr Mendelsohn said.

While social media coverage of their designs led to an appearance on the Today show, their big break came when a Shark Tank producer spotted one of their sweaters at a holiday party and contacted them.

They went on the show and persuaded Robert Herjavec to invest $100,000 in return for 10per cent of the company. In June, Mr Herjavec told CNBC that Tipsy Elves had been his best investment in five seasons of Shark Tank.

'You have a highly educated lawyer making 200 grand a year, quits his job to sell inappropriate Christmas sweaters. How can you not love that?' he said of Mr Mendelsohn.

In 2013, the company made about $3 million, having pulled in $800,000 the year before.

Mr Mendelsohn said the biggest force driving their revenue has been their expansion into other product lines, such as college sweaters for large state schools including the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Michigan. They've also begun creating festive shirts for other popular holidays such as St. Patrick's Day and Valentine's Day.

But their most popular designs are their risque holiday sweaters, which cost $34.95-$69.95, including one that shows a 'suspicious gnome' wielding an axe.

Mr Mendelsohn thinks the popularity of ugly Christmas sweaters suggests a 'backlash against how serious the holidays have become'.

'Christmas sweaters were really popular in the '80s, and then they went out of style. When you look at the holidays, particularly starting around the early 2000s, they've become more of a serious, stressful time,' he said.

'There's an emphasis on black-tie events and formal holiday parties that no one wants go to. Ugly Christmas sweaters are a celebration of what holidays should be: having a good time and being silly.'
