A brother who saw his little sister's drawings pinned on the fridge and imagined what they would be like as toys has created a company bringing children's artwork to life.

Alex Furmansky runs a Florida-based company which can turn doodles and photographs into stuffed toys.

Customers can take a photo of the drawing and email or text it to Budsies.

Then a team of artists, designers, cutters, and seamstresses come together to create each unique toy by hand.

A brother who saw his little sister's drawings pinned on the fridge and imagined what they would be like as toys has created a company bringing children's artwork to life

The Boynton Beach, Florida-based company can turn doodles and photographs into stuffed toys

Customers can take a photo of the drawing and email or text it to Budsies

Then a team of artists, designers, cutters, and seamstresses come together to create each unique toy by hand

The firm say they can turn anything into a stuffed animal 'from drawings to paper crafts to photos of real people'.

Turnaround time for the $69 is around 5 weeks and the company have made a range of toys for different customers - they have made lots of toys for children in therapy

Furmansky says: 'The idea for Budsies came when I saw Michelle hugging her stuffed animals and tucking them in at night. 

'What if I could turn a drawing into a stuffed animal friend that would last forever? Quite literally bring her drawings to life!

Budsies founder Alex Furmansky says he got the idea from his younger sister whose art was pinned to the fridge

Although the idea started with kids' drawings, adults also frequently send in artwork or photographs to get turned into toys

He told the Miami New Times, the process is simple. 'First, an operator here looks at the incoming artwork and does two things: one, verifies that it's not obscene, and two, adds basic notes, like' - he uses the alligator to demonstrate - 'this tail should be exaggerated, the horn should be white, etc.' 

Next, 'it goes to a designer who takes those notes and actually starts picking the fabrics and drawing the patterns. 

'Then it goes to the worker who actually sews the plush together.'

The company use new hypoallergenic materials and adhere to rigorous standards of stitching quality and materials so all the toys go through safety testing.

Furmansky says his team will do a comparison test: 'They'll hold up the original artwork along with the finished product and compare: 'is it cute enough? If not, we scrap it and start again.'

The 16-inch-tall, hypoallergenic toys are created from scratch by a team of artists, designers, cutters, and seamstresses

The Budsie is then shipped out with a framed version of the artwork it was created from so children can see the instant similarity 

The company have made a range of toys for different customers - they have made lots of toys for children in therapy

'The idea for Budsies came when I saw Michelle hugging her stuffed animals and tucking them in at night. What if I could turn a drawing into a stuffed animal friend that would last forever?' says the founder

'We use all new hypoallergenic materials and adhere to rigorous standards of stitching quality and materials. Each toy is unique so we inspect each one for loose parts,' the company says
