Forthright opinion: Lord Lawson told MPs pay consultants who advise banks on their salary packages make prostitutes look 'respectable'

Pay consultants who advise banks on their salary packages make prostitutes look ‘respectable’, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer said today.

Tory peer Lord Lawson gave his forthright opinion as MPs took evidence on standards in the banking industry.

He said: ‘In my experience, they [pay consultants] are a profession which makes prostitution seem thoroughly respectable.’

And Lord Lawson, who ran Britain’s finances under Margaret Thatcher, refused to back down even when a female witness giving evidence to him took exception to the characterisation.

Carol Arrowsmith, a senior pay consultant with accountancy firm Deloitte, said it was ‘difficult’ to accept the suggestion that her profession was worse than prostitution.

‘It may be difficult but it may be true,’ retorted the famously outspoken Westminster grandee.

Lord Lawson, who as Nigel Lawson served as Chancellor under Margaret Thatcher, said pay consultants feared missing out on future advisory fees if they angered bank bosses by suggesting modest pay deals.

‘They know that if they recommend low pay, they won’t get a repeat performance...so they pitch it as high as they can,’ he said.

Another witness, management author David Bolchover, said there was an ‘extremely powerful nexus’ in the business community with a ‘vested interest in high pay’.

He accused bankers of profiting from a myth that very few people could do their job, despite the fact that it is ‘extremely questionable whether they have a rare talent’.

And he said bosses were too scared to cut the pay of junior staff, in case their own salaries were slashed as well.

‘These decisions are hard-wired into the system,’ he said.

The banking standards committee also 
heard from former Barclays pay chief Alison Carnwath, who said she had 
been a lone voice in calling for former boss Bob Diamond to be stripped 
of his bonus in 2011.

Mr Diamond was awarded a £2.7million bonus in 2011, the same year that the bank had to put aside £1billion to cover the cost of compensation for mis-selling PPI loan insurance.

Ms Carnwath said she had been ‘amazed’ when Barclays chairman Marcus Agius recommended that the bonus be paid anyway.

‘I thought it was the wrong recommendation and...it would have been best if his bonus for the year had been zero,’ she said, adding that this would have set a ‘leadership example’.

But she said fellow directors were worried at how Mr Diamond would react to losing the payout. ‘There were conversations in corridors,’ she said.

‘A lot of people felt Mr Diamond needed to have his bonus and that it was important to him.’ She added that investment bankers had become used to an ‘obscene level of reward’ and indulged in a ‘culture of entitlement’.

Mr Diamond later stepped down after the bank was fined £290million for its role in the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal.

Her successor Sir John Sunderland raised eyebrows among MPs when he said that even with hindsight he would still pay Mr Diamond a bonus, because he ‘deserved some recognition’.

But he insisted reports that Barclays’ new boss Antony Jenkins was in line for a £1million bonus this year were just ‘speculation’.

Asked if he was aware that a payout on that scale could spark fury among the public, he said: ‘I understand the implications of your question very well.’
