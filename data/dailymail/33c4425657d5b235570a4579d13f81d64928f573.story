Yesterday saw Princess Beatrice take to the phones in London as she joined Samuel L. Jackson for a day of celebrity trading for charity.

Not to be outdone, her sister Princess Eugenie and mother Sarah Ferguson followed suit a couple of hours later - only, in New York.

Mother and daughter took to the phones and cut or deal or two during the telethon at the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald and BGC in the Big Apple.

Working the phones: A businesslike Duchess of York and Princess Beatrice work the phones in New York

Both had clearly dressed for the event, with businesslike black dresses seen on both royal women, although the former Duchess of York chose to accessorise hers with a neat cream jacket.

The Duchess of York and Princess Eugenie
 are no stranger to the Cantor Fitzgerald telethon, having previously 
taken part in one in the London office alongside Princess Beatrice in 
2011.

The annual charity telethon began in 2005 following the events of September 11th 2001 and has been held each year in memory of the traders who were killed.

Money raised by the royal and celebrity traders is then directed to the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund which distributes the money to charities around the world, although A-list participants can choose their own charity if they prefer.

Good cause: The pair did the telethon in aid of Children In Crisis, a UK-based education charity

New life: Princess Eugenie moved to the Big Apple last September and has found a job at an auction house

Trade: The pair have taken part in the event before, in Cantor Fitzgerald's London office in 2011

Among those to do so were the Duchess of
 York and Princess Eugenie, who did the telethon in aid of Children in 
Crisis, a UK-based education charity which works with some of the 
world's poorest people.

Since its inception, Charity Day has raised approximately £62 million ($101 million) for good causes around the world, and has seen David Gandy, Clive Owen and Amanda Holden among those to turn trader in years gone past.

Princess Eugenie, 24, moved to New York last September for a three month internship which later turned into a £25,000-a-year job with online auction house, Paddle8.

The princess, who travels regularly between the US and London, has since become a stalwart of the Big Apple social scene and was at the charity auction thrown by the Duchess of Cornwall's brother Mark Shand on the evening of his fateful fall.

More recently, she was spotted enjoying a day out at the US Open tennis final, where she sipped champagne with entrepreneur Phil Winser, 29.

Eugenie has also allegedly spoken out about the imminent arrival of royal baby number two, with U.S Weekly claiming the princess told them that she is 'very excited' about the new family member.

Enjoying herself: On Tuesday, Princess Eugenie joined entrepreneur Phil Winser, 29, at the US Open final
