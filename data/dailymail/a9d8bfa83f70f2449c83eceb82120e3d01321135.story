A 33-year-old man has revealed how he has coped after his mother arranged the brutal murder of his father with the help of his younger brother.

Games-keeper Nigel Bacon was stabbed six times in the driveway of his cottage in Clumber Park, Nottinghamshire, on November 26, 2008.

He wife, Susan Bacon, now 59, had phoned for an ambulance after her husband had managed to drag himself bleeding back into their home.

But when paramedics arrived, they found Susan showed little concern for the welfare of her dying 50-year-old husband and calmly sat smoking a cigarette while they fought a losing battle to save his life.

It later transpired that Susan had been behind the horrific attack with the help of her son, Michael, now 25, after they hired 29-year-old Peter Jacques to carry out the stabbing.

She had also aided Jacque's actions by turning off the lights when Nigel had gone to lock the gates at the end of their drive so the assasin could approach unnoticed by his victim.

Her other son, Stuart, who was estranged from the family at the time, was shocked and devastated when he heard what had happened.

He reveals on tonight's episode of Britain’s Darkest Taboos on the Crime & Investigation Network: 'To be murdered by your own family, I don't think there's anything lower than that.'

He added: 'When the police phoned me up and told me what happened, I didn't know what to think. I knew my family was strange and everything and that we was different - and obviously I was part of that family at one point - but I didn't think it would go that far.'

Stuart haven't had any contact with his family for years after his parents had subjected him to a violent upbringing.

In the nineties both Susan and Nigel had been convicted of wilfully ill treating a young person under 16 after they had battered him on numerous occasions and even tied him up.

But despite the way he had been treated by his father in his youth, he felt no joy or release in knowing he was dead. He believes his mother should have left or divorced Nigel if she could no longer stand to be with him.

'My dad didn't deserve that, I walked away from everything I knew and loved, if I could do that as a child and lose everything why can't a grown woman do that?' he said.

Stuart regrets that he will now never be able to have a relationship with his father. 

Speaking of his death, he said: 'It made me think of all the time lost and that maybe I should have gone and found him and tried and talked, even if he still didn't want to listen, even if he was still the same man he was. I should have made more of an effort and I wouldn't feel as empty as I do now.'  

Remarkably, he added that he still feels for his mother despite her cold-blooded actions.

He said: 'I'll always love her because she's my mum but I hate her and that will never change.'

'They had a lot of debts around their necks and there were no way my dad would have bailed them out'

A jury at Nottingham Crown Court in 2009 heard how Susan had planned the murder with Michael because they were both in debt and wanted to get their hands on Nigel's £350,000 estate.

Nigel made his fortune through building a successful security company and then gaining his dream job as a gamekeeper.

Stuart said his brother had expected to take over the security firm when Nigel started his new career. But Nigel didn't trust Michael to do the job and refused to hand over the firm to him.

Stuart said this would have aggrieved both Michael and his mother and left them bitter and desperate.

He explains: 'My mum spent years promising Michael that you put up with this and you do this and that for me and this business will be yours, I promise you. Well my mum couldn't keep that promise as my dad had stuck his heels in and said "no way".

'When my dad was like that he meant it, there was going to be no way of changing his mind.'

Michael was in need of the job after racking up debts buying cars and getting married.

His mother was also living beyond her means and had debts of more than £60,000.

'They had a lot of debts around their necks and there were no way my dad would have bailed them out,' Stuart said.

Cold-blooded contract killing: Susan and Michael plotted Nigel's death to gain his fortune

So instead, they jointly conceived a murderous plan to murder Nigel and make it seem like a burglary gone wrong.

After approaching a number of people, telling them she was a victim of domestic abuse and needed help to deal with her husband, they eventually hired Jacques, who was also in debt, offering to pay him  'tens of thousands of pounds'.

Michael met him to give him an upfront payment of £1,000 the day before they had planned for the murder to take place.

Police officer Kate Meynell said Jacques used the money to buy his 'killing kit' - dark clothing, hat, gloves and knives from Tesco.

While Susan thought she had planned the perfect murder, Jacques was not an 'effective contract killer' and his hat was found at the scene of the crime.

'I
blame her for everything. She deserves all she gets, I hope she rots in that 
prison'

By pulling his DNA from the garment, the police were able to trace and arrest Jacques. They then found his links to the Bacon's after checking his mobile phone records.

After gathering enough evidence, Susan and Michael are charged and Susan was imprisoned pending the trial.

Stuart visited his mother during this time. He said: 'I was expecting to find a woman in bits and she wasn't she was still the same cocky arrogant woman that didn't care about anyone but herself. She was trying to make out to me that Michael was the murderer.'

The visit left Stuart, now a father himself, feeling lucky that he broke ties with his family as a teenager.

He
said: 'I'd spent years longing for my family and I'm sat there on this visit and I'm 
thinking "thank god you're not near my kids, thank god they are there and 
you are in here cause, wow, look what you have done to my brother."'

While Stuart said he will never forgive Susan or Michael, he has some 
sympathy for his brother, who was eight when he left him to start his 
new life without the family.

He
explained: 'I love my brother and he's still that little boy that I 
left behind. I know he's a grown man and I know he's done these terrible
things but I find it hard to accept some of what he's done, just 
because he's my brother and I know what my mum is like. But I don't 
think I can forgive him cause it's still murder.'

On 18 December 2009, a jury found Susan, Michael and Jacques guilty of murder. Michael is given a life sentence with a minimum term of 21 years, Susan is sentenced to life with a minimum of 24 years and Peter is also sentenced to life and ordered to serve a minimum of 28 years.

The judge calls it a 'cold-blooded contract killing' and describes Michael as his 'mother's creature', claiming Susan was the driving force behind the crime.

Stuart is now trying to move on with his life by focusing on his own family.

'I take every day as it comes, I focus on my kids, as long as they are happy and feel loved and stuff like that then I'm happy and that's just how I take life,' he said.

Since the trial, he has also forged a relationship with his half sisters, Kerry and Lyndsey, who his father had prior to marrying Susan.

Nigel had always denied that Kerry was his daughter but DNA tests after his death confirmed his paternity.

Stuart said finding his half sisters was one ray of light to come out of the murder.

He said: 'I know that'' daft to say that anything good came out of the circumstances of murder but I've found my family, I’ve got my sisters back.'

Kerry and Lyndsey said they will never forgive Susan for her part in murdering their father.

Kerry said: 'She could have got out, my mum did, she could have got out no matter what but she wouldn't go anywhere without the money, she'd find another way and the only other way was killing him.'

Lyndsey added: 'I blame her for everything. I blame her for taking him away and for taking his life. She deserves all she gets, I hope she rots in that prison.'

But they both agree that finding a brother in Stuart has been something positive from their father's loss.

Kerry said: 'It's nice to know that he's back in our lives again and he's not on his own.'
