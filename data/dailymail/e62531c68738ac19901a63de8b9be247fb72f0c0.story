Eden Hazard is on the verge of is signing a new contract with Chelsea worth a staggering £200,000 a week.

Talks with the Chelsea forward’s lawyer are at an advanced stage and the club are hoping to conclude negotiations with the Belgian international within the next few weeks.

Hazard’s extended deal, which will be worth around £10million to the forward over the next five seasons, will also be a bitter blow to long-term suitors Paris St Germain.

Jose Mourinho confirmed on Tuesday: 'It's true Chelsea is trying to have an agreement for a new contract (for Hazard).

'It will be a question of time. It will end with a new contract.

'He wants to commit to us and we want to commit to him for the future.'

Hazard is now one of Chelsea’s most influential players and he will be rewarded with a deal that reflects his growing status at the club.

The Chelsea forward, who was named the club’s player of the year at the end of last season, was given the No 10 shirt vacated by Juan Mata at the start of the new campaign.

Hazard only joined the club two years ago from Lille in a deal worth £32m and has settled in to life in London after some initial difficulties.

His partnership with new signing Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa continues to flourish and he is now considered to be one of the club’s biggest assets.

Chelsea, who are top of the Barclays Premier League after a stunning start to the season, are busy tying up their best young players on new long term deals.

They announced last week that Thibaut Courtois, who has replaced Petr Cech as the club’s first choice keeper, has signed a new five year contact. 

Chelsea want to protect their interests by committing the best young talent to long-term contracts, but they are also being rewarded with huge rises.

Hazard’s deal with Chelsea was worth around £100,000 when he arrived from Lille two years ago, but he will double that when he signs his new contract with the club.

Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho continues to influence the key decisions at the club and he has built a new team at Chelsea after a year of transition following his return from Real Madrid.

After their Champions League group game with Schalke at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday, they will turn their attentions to a reunion with referee Mike Dean at the Etihad on Sunday.

Dean hasn’t refereed a Chelsea fixture since his unbeaten home record came to an end following the defeat against Sunderland at Stamford Bridge last season. 

Paris Saint-Germain were reportedly interesting in Hazard during the summer but he is committed to Chelsea

At the time, Mourinho sarcastically said: ‘Congratulations to Mike Dean because he made a fantastic performance and congratulations to Mike Riley, because what they did during the season was fantastic for the way the championship is going.

‘Congratulations to all of them and I have nothing more to say.’

Mourinho was later fined £10,000 by the Football Association, but insists he has no issue with Dean, or referees’ chief Mike Riley.
