Families around the country flocked to parks and beaches today to make the most of a sunny spring day - with the prospect of fine conditions for the Easter weekend.  

Parents and children were able to make the most of the school holidays, with temperatures reaching a high of 16C in the South of England.  

Areas such as St James's Park in London and Cardiff's Cathays Park displayed flourishing white and pink blossoms, which attracted nature lovers as well as sun worshippers.

Spring: The warmth combined with colourful plant life to create the perfect day out 

Soaking up the sun: People flocked to St James's Park in central London as temperatures in the South of England reached 16C today 

Promising: Warm weather is forecast for Good Friday - but could be a little more unsettled from Saturday

The fine weather is expected to continue for the rest of the week, with sun tomorrow and highs of 14C.  

Wednesday is expected to be another dry and bright day across most of the country, although there will be patches of rain in Scotland.  

The drizzle will continue in Scotland on Thursday morning, but it is set to be mainly dry for England and Wales, with temperatures of up to 19C in the South. 

Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite said: ‘From Thursday onwards we’re less confident.

We’re looking at things gradually becoming cloudier through Thursday, it might be  a bit cooler.

‘The question mark comes on Saturday. We’re going to get high pressure in the north and east of the country.

‘What this 
means is that we will have an area of lower pressure to the south and 
west. And the UK is going to be sat between the two. The lower pressure 
will have the wetter, cooler conditions.

‘As we go into Sunday, the threat of the things from the south-west increases.’

Despite
 the disappointing forecast, it will not be as bad as last year, the 
coldest Easter on record, when a freeze sent temperatures  tumbling to 
-12.5C (10F).

And in 2010, 13in (33cm) of snow fell. The wettest Easter was in 1963, with 6in (149mm) of rain in Wales.

The unseasonably warm weather of the last few days has sent holidaymakers pouring on to beaches and into parks.

It
 even attracted a Minke whale, spotted on the Cornish coast. The animals
 would not usually be seen in British waters until the seas have warmed 
up much later in the year
