Monica Van De Pitte has won undisclosed damages after settling a discrimination and harassment case with her former employer

A mother-of-two who was 'mooed' at while pumping breast milk at work has won undisclosed damages after settling a discrimination and harassment case with her former employer in Oregon.

Monica Van De Pitte also alleges that she found a picture of a cow taped to the door of the supply room at Velocitel, a Lake Oswego-based wireless network company, that she and other mothers were told to use for pumping while at work.

Van De Pitte said the harassment was so hurtful that she 'struggled to compose herself enough to express any milk once inside the room', according to her complaint.

On joining the company in 2012, Van De Pitte had explained to bosses that she was still nursing her one-year-old son, and would need a private space where she could pump during the work day, reports People magazine. 

On her first day of work, another nursing mother warned her to keep her breast pump hidden because other employees thought it was 'gross.' 

Van De Pitte also alleged that some of her colleagues openly bragged about their sex lives.

Her complaint states that one colleague was nicknamed 'The Walking HR Violation' because of his harassing conduct.

He was accused of regularly demeaning women, including Van De Pitte, by pretending to 'honk' their breasts. 

When Van De Pitte approached the man and asked him to stop his demeaning behavior - he just 'snickered' at her concerns. 

After another month, Van De Pitte said she complained to bosses about the man's behavior and was told that she needed to 'privately reflect on why sexual conversations made her uncomfortable.' 

Van De Pitte quit her job at Velocitel in 2013 and filed a formal complaint with Oregon's Bureau of Labor and Industries. 

A settlement was recently reached, but the amount of compensation was not disclosed.
