Women obsessed with emulating singer Rihanna have pushed sales of her perfume Rebelle to the top of the bestseller list in the UK.

Since being released in February the fragrance has sold over 2 million bottles and is expected to sell a record-breaking 4million by the end of the year.

At the launch in February Rihanna said: 'My new fragrance is about taking control but still being a lady. There's a feminine, romantic element to the fragrance - but there's also a defiant quality in it. I love its duality.'

The Rebelle fragrance, which comes in a conical-shaped bottle inspired by the shape of a sexy stiletto heel, has been 
designed 'to capture the the warmth of the Carribbean sun, reflecting 
Barbados-born Rihanna's roots, but also the whirl of her present-day 
life' (and that means it smells of strawberries, plums, ginger, cacao absolute, vanilla orchid and heliotrope, in case you were wondering).

It is the second perfume to be released by the star and is beating Britney Spears (Midnight Fantasy), Jennifer Lopez (Glow), Beyonce (Heat) and even Victoria Beckham (Intimately Beckham for her) in the notoriously competitive celebrity fragrance chart.

Director Anthony Mandler who has worked 
with the singer on more than a dozen of her music videos since 2006 was brought on 
board to photograph the Rebelle campaign and given a brief to make it 
dramatic, daring and sexy.

Rihanna's first perfume Reb'l Fleur, 
released last year, was an attempt to show her sweet side after she 
received criticism for her provocative image.

But it looks like Rihanna is now embracing her saucy side, and cashing in on it too, with prices for the range starting at £20 and going up to £37.50 for 100ml.
