A gunman who killed two friends at a Yemeni wedding when he lost control of his AK-47 can be seen trying to fire it one-handed in new footage.

The latest footage shows the gunman gyrating to Gangnam Style before firing celebratory shots into the air on a packed dance floor.

But he could not control the powerful weapon with one hand and sprayed bullets at fellow revellers.

The horrific footage of the wedding in the southern city of Taiz was posted online to Liveleak yesterday.

It opens with people happily dancing to the hit song by South Korean pop star Psy.

The gunman, dressed in a white striped shirt, can be seen in the background gyrating to the music.

As the song reaches its chorus, the guest can be seen raising the gun into the air with just one hand.

However, it is too powerful and the man then shoots people dancing next to him.

It takes a moment for the music to be switched off and the noise is then replaced by people screaming and writhing in agony on the ground.

Some guests are seen immediately jumping on mopeds to either escape the carnage or get help.Â 

Friends and family crowd around to try and aid the victims.

Two men were killed in the incident and two others were treated in hospital.

The video could not be independently verified.

It is also not known if the gunman was arrested after the incident.

Although it is illegal in many parts of Yemen to carry weapons during weddings, gunfire during such celebrations is common practice.

There are frequently reports of fatalities despite the authorities' best efforts.

Last year, a tribal sheikh was killed by 'celebratory' gunfire - and as a result, there was a nationwide petition against guns.
