Whisky is being produced in London for the first time in more than 100 years.

The London Distillery Company, based in Battersea, has been granted the capital’s first licence to produce single malt whisky since the early 1900s and yesterday saw its first British spirit flow from the still.

The boutique distillery, which has been producing Dodd's gin since the spring of this year, is the first whisky distillery in London since Lea Valley Distillery in Stratford, East London.

Distillery in Stratford

The alcohol is to be distilled in a 650-litre copper pot still, which has been named Matilda after founder Darren Rook’s Scottish grandmother.

The spirit will be produced during the second distillation and matured in casks for a minimum of three years and one day.

At this stage, under UK and EU rules, it can legally be sold as single malt whisky.

The distillery is to source whisky’s 
three main ingredients, water, malted barley and yeast, from local – 
south-east England – sources.

The barley will be sourced from Warminister Maltings, Wiltshire, and the yeast from Surebrew in Surrey.

The distillery has a capacity to fill up to 100 casks.

Whisky has three main ingredients - water, malted barley and yeast – which are aged in wooden casks.

According to London Distillery Company co-founder Darren Rook, whiskey production in England dates back to the 1300s.

In Scotland, the spirit is known as ‘Scotch Whisky’, and this cannot be produced in any other country.

The production of whisky in England used to operate in London and other cities in the UK before ceasing entirely in the early 1900s.

However, there has been a recent revival, with a producer in Norfolk, The English Whisky Company, becoming the first to distil the spirit in 100 years in 2009.

The first bottles of whisky, which are not yet named, will be released by the London Distillery Company in 2016.

‘It is not widely known that the capital has a great heritage of whiskey production dating back to before Chaucer,’ said Mr Rook.

‘Since meeting co-founder, Nick 
Taylor, it has taken just over three years of hard work from the early 
concept to get to where we are today. 

‘We are really excited to be part of a new chapter in the city’s distilling legacy.’

Mr Rook said it was the company's intention to perfect gin and whiskey production, but did not rule out producing further spirits in the future, saying: 'There are definitely more spirits on the horizon.'

He added: ‘This is really only the start of the journey as we have some time until the whisky reaches its optimum.

‘We’re aiming to create an historical style of single malt with a great depth of flavour and floral backbone.

‘That said, thanks to our small size and the equipment, we are not limited to one style. One fermentation will fill one cask, so we are able to experiment and create bespoke whiskies.’
