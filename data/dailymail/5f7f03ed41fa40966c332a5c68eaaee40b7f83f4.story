President Dilma Rousseff was re-elected on Sunday after a tight runoff vote against a centrist challenger.

Brazil's leftist candidate secured a slim majority of the vote against Aecio Neves, as her anti-poverty program proved too popular for his pro-business platform.

The campaign split the country, with Rousseff winning 51.6 percent against Neves with more than 99 percent of votes in.

Supporters: Fans of Rousseff waved flags with her name and the symbol of the Worker's Party during a ceremony celebrating her re-election

Rousseff's election marks a continuation of her Worker's Party in control of Brazil's executive branch, which it has held since 2003.

In São Paulo, the capital of Brazil's wealthiest state, where Neves's Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) enjoys a large following, the mood was subdued.

In Brasilia, Rousseff took the stage in front of red banners emblazoned with photos from her days as a militant fighting the military dictatorship.

'My dears, my friends, we have arrived at the end of a campaign that intensely mobilized all the forces of this country,' she said 'I thank every Brazilian, without exception.'

Rousseff became the country's first woman president after her election in 2010. Born into an upper-class family, she became a socialist after the 1964 coup and was arrested and reportedly tortured by the regime.

In her speech Sunday, she expressed her gratitude to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who she served as chief of staff during his second presidential term and who tipped her to run in 2010.

Jubilation: Many supporters waved flags and wore T-shirts emblazoned with photos from her days as a militant fighting the military dictatorship

Relief: Rousseff's party often stoked fears among voters that if the PSDB returned to power, so too would the rampant inequality that defined Brazil pre-Lula

Narrow win: Rousseff's administration has said it will push for a national reconciliation, as the narrow vote split Brazilians between the president and Neves after a bitter campaign

Under Lula, the country's economy grew steadily, while programs targeting the poor were able to lift millions out of poverty, increasing wages and dropping the unemployment rate to 4.9 percent.

According to Forbes, during the eight years of Lula's presidency, the ranks of the middle class ballooned, with the amount of Brazilians with bank accounts going from 70 million to 115 million. 

But the pace of growth slowed under Rousseff, who has been criticized for intervening too often in the Brazilian economy, leading to unpredictability in the market.

Rousseff has also been blamed for deteriorating public services, like healthcare, and numerous incidents of corruption, notably a bribery scandal involving the state-run Petroleo Brasileiro.

'There is one easy way to put an end to corruption: throw the Workers' Party out of office,' Neves insisted during the final debate between the candidates on Friday.

Rousseff's party often stoked fears among voters that if the PSDB returned to power, so too would the rampant inequality that defined Brazil pre-Lula. 

'We need Dilma to continue the programs that improve the lives of those in need,' said Livia Roma, 19, a university student in Sao Paulo, as she voted on Sunday. 

'I didn't vote for myself, but for the minorities and less fortunate classes.' 

Ideli Salvatti, one of Rousseff's top ministers, said the government needed to bring forth 'a national reconciliation process
given how tight the result was.'

'We have to calm our hearts down first and then get back to
work tomorrow,' she told reporters.  

Brazil's investor class has been cold on Rousseff, and Brazil's markets took a tumble on poll results showing she was likely to win the runoff. Some fear another drop when they open Monday.
