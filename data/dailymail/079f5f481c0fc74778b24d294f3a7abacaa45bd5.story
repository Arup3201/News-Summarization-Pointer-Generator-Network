In his days as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown roamed the halls of parliament with a stony expression and a sharp tongue. 

But becoming a husband to Sarah Brown, 51, and a father to their two boys, appears to have softened the man who was once described by Tony Blair as 'The Big Clunking Fist', beyond all recognition. 

In a new interview with HouseBeautiful magazine, Sarah's mother, Pauline Macaulay, let slip that on Mother's Day, the ex-Prime Minister is likely to join his wife and their two sons for a rare treat of breakfast in bed.

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown with his wife Sarah and children Fraser (L) and John (R) in December 2014 during a press conference to announce he is standing down as an MP in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. The close-knit family have transformed Brown from a serious bachelor in the early days of New Labour to a man who enjoys kitchen table suppers 

When asked what her plans for Mother's Day were, Sarah revealed that she was hoping to be gifted with a simple homemade meal made by Gordon, 63, and their two boys, John, 11, and Fraser, eight.

She said: 'I hope so. Just a bit of toast and a cup of tea and I'm good.'

Sarah's mother Pauline added: 'And everyone piling into bed at the same time.' 

It is a far cry from Brown's bachelor days as a young politician - when New Labour came to power in 1997, he was said to work 18 hours a day, six days a week. 

His dedication to his work was so strong that an ex-girlfriend, Princess Marguerite of Romania, once described their relationship as 'politics, politics, politics.'

But even Brown himself now admits that his attitude to to life and work, especially in regards to his two sons, has changed dramatically in recent years. 

He told the magazine: 'Before I had children I always thought I’d want them to succeed, do well and study hard. 

'But when you have your boys, you realise you just want them to be happy.” 

'I would add to that – I’d also want them to know and understand what our values are and then take them forward and do things their way.’

When it comes to bringing up her boys, Sarah revealed she also just wants them to be happy. 

The charity ambassador said: ‘As parents, all Gordon and I can do is share our values with them – but they’ll make their own choices.' 

For Sarah, she doesn't need to look further than her own upbringing and her mother Pauline  for inspiration.

She said: ‘When I was growing up Mum was a strong role model as a feminist, working mum and somebody who had gone back to a career after having children.

'She trained as a teacher, then a headteacher and has a PhD in social anthropology. Whatever glass ceiling exists, my mother’s always pushing it higher.

‘My mum’s home in Dorset has always been a base where I can come and take stock. All the family spent time there last summer. 

'When I come and see Mum I do a lot of sleeping and not a lot else!’

At home in Scotland, Sarah and Gordon are keen for their boys, John and Fraser, to enjoy a normal, happy childhood. 

The couple, who married in 2000, tragically lost their first child, daughter Jennifer, in 2001 when she was just  10 days old.

Today, Sarah wants to mirror her own happy memories. 'My home life with Gordon and the boys in Scotland is similar in some ways to my childhood.

'It’s busy and we all have our own activities, but the heart of my house is the kitchen table, just like Mum’s. 

'You never know whom you’re going to find around that table.’ 

The former PR executive is now in charge of global charity Theirworld which she launched 12 years ago to address the rights of women and children around the world 

She’s currently campaigning to ensure that the UN promise to have every child in school by 2016 becomes a reality with her #UpForSchool Campaign, and is working with Gordon to help secure the release of the kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls.

She has now taken to social media to promote her charity: ‘I started using social media, including Twitter, to connect with a younger audience during my time at 10 Downing Street,’ she said. 

‘My work is to make sure I can use the skills that I have to connect with people and empower them to make a difference too.’ 

Yesterday, it was revealed that she was joining the a line-up of 17 celebrities for the Great British Comic Relief Bake Off because her family are fans of the series.

'I live in a household of Bake Off lovers. My little boys just adore the programme so they’ve been my greatest fans for me taking part in the show.'
