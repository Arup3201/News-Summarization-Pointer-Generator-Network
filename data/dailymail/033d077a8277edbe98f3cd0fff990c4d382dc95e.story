Thousands of Christmas shoppers are facing delays to their online orders after a courier giant announced it cannot cope with the number of packages in its system.

Yodel has been forced to stop accepting any new parcels for two days to give it time to clear the backlog sitting on the back of its lorries.

The decision could mean hold-ups for customers expecting deliveries from the firm, which serves thousands of retailers including Amazon, Argos and Tesco. 

Courier firm Yodel has delayed parcel deliveries by up to two days because it is struggling to cope with the pre-Christmas sales boom 

Further pressure was added on transport services by another £666million being spent on Manic Monday

Yodel, which describes itself as the UK’s leading parcel carrier after the Royal Mail, handles more than 135million items a year and claims to work with 80 per cent of top retailers. But it is regularly ranked worst for complaints and customer service.

The firm stopped all new parcel collections from delivery hubs yesterday and today to give staff time to deliver items sitting in warehouses or on trailers.

Industry experts said internet retailers and courier companies had failed to forecast the Black Friday and Cyber Monday spending binges a fortnight ago.

Yodel hired 5,000 staff before Christmas, including thousands of self-employed drivers and couriers, and insisted it was well placed to cope with the festive rush.

But yesterday its executive chairman, David Stead, sent out a letter to retailers saying it had been forced to stop accepting new parcels.

In it, he said: ‘In the last two weeks we have seen the most frenetic sales activity on record.’ 

He added: ‘This is not a decision that we have taken lightly but one that we have had to take to protect service levels.’

Mr Stead stressed that Yodel’s couriers will continue to make deliveries today and through the weekend. It plans to start accepting new parcels again on Monday. But the delivery of some orders may be delayed by three days.   

Amazon whose Swansea, Wales, warehouse is pictured above, said: ‘As a result of the unprecedented number of orders we received during Black Friday Deals Week, the delivery date we promised to some customers was a little longer than would normally have been expected. Normal service has now resumed

Yodel has recently come under fire after it was claimed that one of its couriers was seen hurling a package containing a ceramic poppy from the Tower of London installation 25ft over a garden fence

The Twitter and Facebook pages of Yodel and its retailer clients have been deluged with complaints.

Julia Qin wrote: ‘@YodelOnline can u please arrange a delivery for my parcel, which is late for almost 8 days, I need these in hurry!’ A user called Heather added: ‘@YodelOnline service is disgusting. Monkeys could do a better job. 3 times my parcel delivered to the wrong address. NEVER AGAIN!!!!’

Dan Wilson of Tamebay, a news website for small online traders, said: ‘It seems that everyone’s forecast on how big e-commerce was going to be this Christmas was too low and everyone is struggling.’

He added: ‘Consumers would be wise to accept the fact that it would be wise to add a couple of days to any expected delivery date. Leaving Christmas shopping online to the last minute will be something of a dangerous game.’ 

Amazon recorded 5.5million orders on Black Friday, an average of 64 items every second. As a result there were delays for people who expected next day deliveries under the Amazon Prime service. 

Other companies that use Yodel include Argos, River Island, Very and Littlewoods. 

Argos admitted it was forced to extend delivery times from four to seven days in order to rebuild stock levels after the Black Friday promotions. It says deliveries are back to normal, adding: 'We are very sorry'.  

The backlog is also affecting the Collect Plus service, where shoppers pick up their internet purchases from local stores. It warned shoppers that their orders could be delayed by up to three days.

Tesco said its Direct Click and Collect service would suffer hold-ups, adding: ‘We apologise to any customers affected and are working with Yodel to resolve the problems as quickly as possible.’  

Yodel has recently come under fire after it was claimed that one of its couriers was seen hurling a package containing a ceramic poppy from the Tower of London installation 25ft over a garden fence when he was unable to reach the customer's front door.

Dozens of ceramic poppies which were planted at the Tower of London to commemorate those who died during the First World War arrived at customers' homes broken into pieces.
