One of Britain’s richest women was subjected to a terrifying knifepoint ordeal by a burglar who stole jewellery worth £250,000.

Patsy Bloom, 72, was confronted while watching TV in bed by a deranged intruder who screamed ‘Give me everything you’ve got.’

He then frogmarched her to a safe and escaped with a huge haul, including a £68,000 pair of 18-carat white gold earrings and a £19,000 diamond pendant.

Miss Bloom, who netted £16million with the sale of animal insurer Petplan, was left ‘extremely shaken’ by the raid at her £3.5million home overlooking London’s Regent’s Park.

The man responsible was violent criminal Ricky Gray who was in the middle of a spree of offences to fund his cocaine addiction.

Two months earlier the 30-year-old snatched an £11,000 platinum diamond solitaire ring from a jeweller in the shadow of the London Stock Exchange.

But despite his appalling criminal record of 61 offences including muggings, burglaries and attacks, Gray could be freed from prison in just four years.

Judge Henry Blacksell QC branded him ‘uncontrolled’ and prepared to use ‘desperate measures’ as he jailed him for eight years.

Gray, who will automatically be released after serving half that amount of time, responded by smiling and yelling, ‘Cheers, thank you!’ as he was led away.

The judge said: ‘This was a lone woman, it was her home, and she was entitled to be in her home and feel she was safe.

'This was a lone woman, it was her home, and she was entitled to be in her home and feel she was safe. She was abused by you and terrified into giving you her property. It was audacious, and that is why you are a risk to the general public'

‘She was abused by you and terrified into giving you her property. It was audacious, and that is why you are a risk to the general public.’

News of the raid came just weeks after Scotland Yard boss Bernard Hogan-Howe said Britons were safer in their own homes ‘than they have ever been in a generation’.

But in Westminster, the latest police figures reveal residential burglaries have soared by almost 40 per cent in recent months.

Miss Bloom became one of the country’s best known businesswomen after she shared the £32million sale price of Petplan in 1996.

The animal lover, who once had a Yorkshire Terrier named Champers, founded the company more than 30 years earlier to fill a gap in the market.

Her ordeal took place when she returned to her five-storey period home after visiting a friend in hospital in May.

'Her bedroom door opened slowly, and the defendant came into the room. He had a knife, which he was pointing at her. He was using both hands to hold it, and used something to cover the handle'

Prosecutor Robert Hutchinson told 
Blackfriars Crown Court: ‘After showering, she got into bed in order to 
watch the news and use her iPad.

‘As she did so, her bedroom door opened slowly, and the defendant came into the room. He had a knife, which he was pointing at her. He was using both hands to hold it, and used something to cover the handle.’

After saying he would not hurt her, Gray screamed: ‘Give me everything you’ve got.’

Mr Hutchinson said: ‘She pointed to a safe which contained her jewellery, and managed to handle the situation calmly and take out all of her jewellery boxes.’

The thief made off with an enormous haul – none of which has been recovered – together with an iPad, iPhone, £500 cash, and several jewellery boxes worth up to £400 each.

Police tracked him down after forensic experts found his fingerprints on a metal cash box in the kitchen.

They discovered that just two months earlier he snatched a platinum diamond solitaire ring from a City jeweller, biting the manager’s fist as she tried to hang on to it.

Gray stuck at Ernest Jones in Paternoster Square after walking in and asking to look at a £10,999 diamond ring.

When staff became suspicious, manager Diawala Odedra silently locked the front doors, trapping the thief inside when he tried to bolt moments later.

Mr Hutchinson said: ‘There was then an exchange during which Miss Odedra demanded he hand the ring back, and if he did so she would let him go.

'They were physically scuffling for the course of a minute, and then he handed the ring back.’

Miss Odedra unlocked the doors, letting Gray out, but he immediately ran back inside and bit her hand as he grabbed the ring and made off.

Saliva from her hand was matched to a DNA profile recorded against his name on police databases.

The court heard Gray was also responsible for three further crimes, including a violent phone robbery and a burglary at his cousin’s home.

Avi Chaudhury, defending, said Gray, who has also been convicted of harassment, stole to buy cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine.

He said the criminal made little effort to conceal his identity because all he cared about was his ‘next fix’.

Gray, of Dartford, Kent, admitted a single count each of robbery, theft, and aggravated burglary and four counts of burglary.

A further burglary charge was left to lie on file, while 21 similar offences were taken into consideration.
