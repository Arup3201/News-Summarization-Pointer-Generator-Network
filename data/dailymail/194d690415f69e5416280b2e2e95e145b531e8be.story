Jimmy Walker has a two-shot advantage at the top of the leaderboard going into the final day of the Sony Open in Hawaii.

The 36-year-old, who triumphed at the Waialae Country Club last year, made his move by carding a fine 62 on day three to become the first outright overnight leader of the weekend.

Walker recovered from a bogey on his second hole of the day to register four birdies on the front nine, before really finding his form after the turn.

He picked up further shots on the 10th and 12th holes before hitting a superb 144-yard approach shot to within five feet of the pin on the 14th for another birdie.

Motoring through with that momentum he added three more birdies to take his tally to 10, with a bogey on the 17th slightly tarnishing his rip-roaring finish.

Walker, who lost last week's Hyundai Tournament of Champions in a play-off, enters the final day two ahead of Matt Kuchar and three ahead of Brian Harman and Troy Merritt.

Kuchar had gone into the penultimate day sharing the lead, but his 68 on day three saw him go to 14 under as Walker took advantage.

Justin Thomas, who equalled the course record on day two, is on 12 under along with South African Tim Clark.

Max Homa's third round 63 lifted him to five shots off the lead, while Jason Kokrak, Shawn Stefani and Harris English are all six behind on 10 under.
