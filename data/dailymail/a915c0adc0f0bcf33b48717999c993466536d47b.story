Victims groups are outraged by a United Nations finding that life sentences being served by two of Australia's most notorious rapist-murderers are 'cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment'.

Bronson Blessington and Matthew Elliott were 14 and 16 respectively when they murdered  20-year-old Janine Balding at Minchinbury, in Sydney's west in 1998. They were sentenced to life in jail two years later.

The crime was one of the most notorious in Australian history, coming just two years after the rape and murder of nurse Anita Cobby  at Prospect, also in western Sydney, by five men who are also serving life sentences without the possibility of parole.

In response to a complaint by lawyers on behalf of Blessington and Elliott, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has found their sentences are in breach of Australia's obligations under the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Matthew James Elliott, who was 16 when he raped and murdered Janine Balding in 1988.

Janine Balding was 20 when kidnapped, raped and murdered by a gang including Bronson Blessington and Matthew Elliott in 1988.

Murder victim Janine Balding was a bank teller who had recently moved to Sydney from Wagga Wagga when she was kidnapped, raped and murdered in 1988.

Stephen 'Shorty' Jamieson was 22 when he, along with Bronson Blessington and Matthew Elliott, raped and murdered bank teller Janine Balding.

Blessington and Elliott, along with three others, kidnapped Ms Balding at knifepoint from Sutherland train station, in Sydney's south, on September 8, 1988. She was driven to a park near Minchinbury where she was repeatedly raped then dumped in a lake and drowned.

Ms Balding, a bank teller who had only recently moved to Sydney from Wagga Wagga, in the state's south, was engaged to be married.

In sentencing, Justice Peter Newman said the crimes against Ms Balding were so barbaric that Blessington, Elliott and Stephen 'Shorty' Jamieson, who was 22 at the time of the murder, should die in jail.

'To sentence people so young to a long term of imprisonment is of course a heavy task,' Justice Newman said. 'However, the facts surrounding the commission of these crimes are so barbaric that I believe I have no alternative other than to impose upon (these) young prisoners, even despite their age, a life sentence. 

'So grave is the nature of this case that I recommend that none of the prisoners in the matter should ever be released.'

Almost a decade after Blessington, Elliott and Jamieson were sentenced, legislation was passed in NSW to keep them and seven other killers behind bars for the rest of their lives. The legislation also covered Ms Cobby's killers: John Travers, Michael Murdoch and Gary, Les and Michael Murphy. 

None of them can ever be released unless they are dying or incapacitated to a point they could not commit a crime.

John Travers was one of five men who raped and murdered Anita Cobby in 1986. He is serving a life sentence and never to be released.

Michael Murdoch is serving a life sentence for the murder of Anita Cobby in 1986.

Michael Murphy was one of three brothers who along with two others raped and murdered nurse Anita Cobby.

Leslie Murphy is serving a life sentence for the rape and murder of Anita Cobby.

Gary Murphy, his brothers Les and Michael, as well as John Travers and Michael Murdoch raped and killed Anita Cobby in 1986. None of them will ever be released.

The United Nations committee found that because the Blessington and Elliott sentences allowed no genuine chance of release, even with full rehabilitation, Australia was in was in breach of the pair's human rights.

The committee found sentences imposed on children must allow for 'the possibility of review and a prospect of release, notwithstanding the gravity of the crime and the circumstances around it'.

"This does not mean that release should necessarily be granted. It rather means that release should not be a mere theoretical possibility and that the review procedure should be a thorough one.'

The Sydney Morning Herald reported Janine Balding's family was horrified by the decision, which is not enforceable. The family wants Blessington, Elliott and Jamieson to die in jail. 

'They knew what they were doing," David Balding said of his sister's killers. 'They should stay where they are. They have nothing to offer society.

'There have been a ridiculous amount of appeals already, including to the High Court. Each one has been rejected and each one has caused this family a huge amount of pain.

'Just when you think it's over, it's on again.'

Peter Rolfe, president of the Support After Murder group, said it was 'absurd' that the UN would interfere in the punishment handed to murderers in Australia.

'Janine Balding was a completely innocent person who had the misfortune to be picked up and indescribably raped and tortured by these low lives,' Mr Rolfe told Daily Mail Australia.

'And yet they are crying out for help now when they made sure that Janine was in no position to receive any help at any stage.'

Mr Rolfe said Janine's mother Bev, who died last year, would be horrifed by the findings.

'Bev, who was a lovely, lovely lady, would be absolutely mortified at (outside interference) into the punishment of the low lives that took away her daughter's life.'

Human Rights Law Centre senior lawyer Ruth Barson, who represented Blessington and Elliott before the UN, said the decision questioned the legality of a system that did allow for consideration of rehabilitation.

'No one is questioning the terrible nature of the crimes committed, but an effective and lawful response to children committing such crimes requires more than simply locking them up and throwing away the key,' she said.
