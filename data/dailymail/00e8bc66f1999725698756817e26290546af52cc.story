An asteroid nine times larger than the QE2 has sailed past the Earth - and is so big it even brought along its own moon.

The 1.7mile long space rock will get no closer than 3.6 million miles, or 15 times the distance between the Earth and the moon.

Scientists have named the asteroid 1998 QE2 but the name has nothing to do with the transatlantic Cunard liner - it follows a code used for newly-discovered asteroids by the US Minor Planet Centre in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The asteroid was captured as it sailed past the earth. It is so big it even dragged its own moon along

Researchers were stunned to spot the 
smaller moon asteroid is circling the larger space rock, an unusual but 
not unheard of space phenomenon.

The main asteroid is believed to be about 1.7 miles long, or nine times the length of the Queen Elizabeth 2.

It
 was discovered on August 19, 1998, by the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research (Linear) programme near 
Socorro, New Mexico.

The object made its closest approach to Earth at 9.59pm last night.

The sequence of radar images of asteroid 1998 QE2 was obtained on 
the evening of May 29, 2013, by NASA scientists using the 230-foot 
(70-meter) Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, when the asteroid 
was about 3.75 million miles (6 million kilometers) from Earth, which is
 15.6 lunar distances.

The first radar images of asteroid 1998 QE2 were obtained when the asteroid was about 3.75 million miles (6 million kilometers) from Earth. The small white dot at lower right is the moon, or satellite, orbiting asteroid 1998 QE2

The main asteroid is believed to be about 1.7 miles long, or nine times the length of the Queen Elizabeth 2 and has a rotation period of 
less than four hours.

The preliminary estimate for the size of the asteroid's satellite, or
 moon, is approximately 2,000 feet (600 meters) wide.

The radar imagery revealed that 1998 QE2 is a binary asteroid.

In the near-Earth population, about 16 percent of asteroids that are 
about 655 feet (200 meters) or larger are binary or triple systems.

Radar images suggest that the main body, or primary, is approximately
 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers) in diameter and has a rotation period of 
less than four hours.

Also revealed in the radar imagery of 1998 QE2 are several dark surface features that suggest large concavities.

The preliminary estimate for the size of the asteroid's satellite, or
 moon, is approximately 2,000 feet (600 meters) wide.

The radar collage 
covers a little bit more than two hours.

As the asteroid moves close, scientists scanned it with radar using a 230ft wide dish telescope at the 
Goldstone Observatory in California’s Mojave Desert.

The resolution of these initial images of 1998 QE2 is approximately 250 feet (75 meters) per pixel. Resolution is expected to increase in the coming days as more data become available.

Between May 30 and June 9, radar astronomers using NASA's 230-foot-wide (70 meter) Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, will perform an extensive campaign of observations on asteroid 1998 QE2.

The two telescopes have complementary imaging capabilities that enabled astronomers to learn as much as possible about the asteroid during its brief visit near Earth.

Even from a distance of nearly four 
million miles, the researchers wanted to study features on the 
asteroid as small as 12ft across.

Chief
 investigator Dr Lance Benner, from the American space agency Nasa’s Jet
 Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: ‘It is 
tremendously exciting to see detailed images of this asteroid for the 
first time.

The giant space rock will get no closer than 3.6 million miles, or 15 times the distance between the Earth and the moon

‘With radar we can transform an object from a point of light into a small world with its own unique set of characteristics.’

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a press briefing about the asteroid: 'scientists have concluded the asteroid 'poses no threat to planet Earth'.

He then laughed and said: 'Never really thought I'd be standing up here saying that, but I guess I am.'

The asteroid will not make a return trip to the Earth for at least another two centuries.

In 2016 Nasa will launch a robotic sample return mission to one of the most potentially hazardous known near-Earth objects (NEOs), the asteroid (101955) Bennu.

The asteroid, which measures a third of a mile across, comes within 500,000 kilometres of the Earth every six years.

Scientists have calculated that in 2182 there is a one in 1,800 chance of the object colliding with the Earth.
