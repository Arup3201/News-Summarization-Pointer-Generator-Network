Felicity Jones will play Hawking's 'dumped' wife Jane Wilde in film The Theory of Everything 

It was seen as a fairytale pairing. He was the ailing academic with the debilitating disease who became a world-acclaimed physicist. 

She was the dark-haired beauty who discarded her studies for love, devoting her life to his care.

So when their 30-year marriage came to an end, and Stephen Hawking, author of A Brief History Of Time, left Jane Wilde for another woman in 1990, the public was aghast: he had fallen for one of his nurses.

Now Hawking’s love affair and the subsequent public disintegration of his marriage has been portrayed in a £25 million film entitled The Theory Of Everything. 

British actress Felicity Jones – best known as the voice of Emma Grundy in The Archers, but whose film credits include Brideshead Revisited and the romcom Chalet Girl – plays the discarded wife and Eddie Redmayne, of Birdsong fame, plays Hawking.

During filming, Hawking and his ex-wife both turned up on set. It was a daunting moment.

Felicity says: ‘Out of the corner of one eye I saw Jane and her new husband and out of the other eye I saw Stephen. It was probably one of the most intimidating moments of my life. 

It must have been so bizarre for them to watch us playing them. It certainly felt awkward for me.’

Hawking and Jane watched a sequence during which Felicity and Redmayne danced together. After the director yelled ‘Cut’, Hawking – who communicates through a computer-based speech generator – asked: ‘Would you ask Felicity if she will come and give me a kiss?’

For 31-year-old Felicity, that moment was a revelation. ‘It shows his rather flirtatious nature and this amazing capacity he has not to take himself too seriously,’ she explains. ‘I embraced him and told him, “You’re amazing!” ’

Felicity said her role involved an extraordinary depth of research, which meant spending time with Hawking and Jane themselves. Felicity says: ‘I met Jane at the Cambridge home she shares with her husband Jonathan.

‘Jane told me she always felt that Stephen’s priority had been physics rather than her. She would even describe physics as his mistress, his one true love. She said she used to joke with him, saying, “You are cheating on me with science.”

‘It is always difficult for a couple where, as happened here, one person becomes very famous.

‘When they divorced, Jane was lost. She had given up so many of her own academic and intellectual pursuits in order to look after this man – although it was something she wanted to do – but she had become so fused with him that, when they were no longer together, she didn’t even know who she was.’

The film, for which Jones and Redmayne are tipped for Oscar nominations, tells how Hawking, who has motor neurone disease and is confined to a wheelchair, met his wife-to-be at Cambridge, and how she coaxed him out of a profound depression and fought against doctors who told the then 21-year-old he would die within two years.

She put her own academic ambitions aside to support her husband while he became a ‘superstar’ in the scientific world, explaining complex theories such as the Big Bang, black holes and multi-dimensional space in layman’s language in his best-selling books. Yet while he was feted in public, at home he relied utterly upon his wife.

The film is based on Jane’s memoir Travelling To Infinity: My Life With Stephen, in which she recalls: ‘He required my help with the minutiae of every personal need, dressing and bathing, as well as with larger movements. I felt like that traveller who had fallen into a black hole: stretched, tugged and pulled like a piece of spaghetti by uncontrollable forces.’

To prepare for her role, Felicity also watched endless video clips of the Hawkings during their marriage. ‘I was struck by the precision of Jane’s care for him. She took care of everything, down to the angle of the glass she would hold to his mouth.

‘It had to be tipped just so, so that he could drink and the dribble wouldn’t go all around his mouth. She had this instinct and ability to know what was best for him. In a way, after she left the academic world herself, he became her field of study.

‘That said, Jane was someone very special. She wrote a thesis on medieval Spanish poetry during the early days of their marriage. 

'She had a very strong sense of her own identity but she also had extraordinary love and compassion. She has a very strong religious faith and part of that faith was about making choices and committing to them.

‘When Stephen was diagnosed with motor neurone disease she thought, “Right, I am going to stand by this person and show him as much love as I can for as long as it takes.” ’

Felicity says she jumped at the role, knowing that Jane had made a huge contribution to Hawking’s success. ‘I read about all these great men in history and there will always be a great woman in the background doing the tedious, less glamorous stuff that keeps it all together. 

'These women should not be invisible.’
