A 21-year-old woman jumped to her death Sunday night from the 14th floor of an upscale condo housing several diplomats, just a block from the United Nations in New York City.

She had recently had a fight with her boyfriend, who lives in the building, and left a suicide note, according to reports.

The woman landed on East 48th Street in front of 100 United Nations Plaza, a 52-story luxury building across the street from the Algerian Embassy.
