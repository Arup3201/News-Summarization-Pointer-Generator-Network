The first and only transgender professional mixed martial arts fighter Fallon Fox may actually be at a disadvantage for having been born a man.

Fox, 38, who was born Boyd Burton in East Toledo, Ohio, revealed her medical history to the MMA and larger world this past March and received intense criticism about her fitness to compete.

But a spectacular October loss that ended her undefeated streak was leaves her wondering if electing to remove all male hormones has her at a disadvantage against biological females whose bodies create just a little of the endurance-enhancing hormone.

Super woman: Transgender MMA fighter Fallon Fox has faced heaps of criticism over her biological past, but a shocking October end to her undefeated streak has some wondering if her full male to female transition actually puts her at a disadvantage against biological women

'I guess they'll come out of the woodwork now,' Fox told GQ as part of an in-depth profile of the fighter published in the January 2014 issue.

'They were afraid before, but now they'll all want to beat a woman who used to be a man.'

Fox was all but devastated following the October 12 brawl against Ashlee Evans-Smith and confided in the GQ writer about her feeling of helplessness.

'I don't know what happened...For some reason, I just can't make it past the first round,' she said. 'I run out of gas. I have to figure this out.'

Intense: Fox trains intensely and has a long-held dream of making it big as a female MMA fighter, but her virtual lack of any male hormones could mean biological women--who produce a small amount of endurance-enhancing testosterone--are actually at an advantage

Blind-sided: Fox was undefeated until October, when her streak fell to Ashlee Evans-Smith and left her in total shock

Bitter irony: Because she no testicles and takes 16 milligrams of estrogen every morning, Fox could have significantly less testosterone than some of her female competitors

GQ speculates that Fox, who traveled to Thailand in 2006 to undergo both top and bottom surgeries, may be experiencing an unwanted side effect from her transition into female.

Biologically, she may be too female.

Like the male testicles, women's ovaries produce testosterone--though, in a very small amount. Also like men, the testosterone can help naturally increase a woman's endurance.

Fox has neither organs and that fact paired with her heavy daily dose of estrogen means she also has virtually no testosterone.

'I guess they'll come out of the woodwork now,' Fox said bitterly following her October defeat. Up until then, the trans fighter had trouble finding women who would agree to step up and fight her. 'They were afraid before, but now they'll all want to beat a woman who used to be a man'

Uphill battle: Fox has faced intense scrutiny since she publicly revealed she is transgender but does her best to stay positive

'I guess this means that people will realize that I'm just a woman after all,' she said. 'I'm female. I'm human. Sometimes I dominate and sometimes I'm dominated'

While her nill male hormone levels allowed her to get medical clearance to compete against women, it may be lowering her ability to defeat them.

Fox is aware of this bitter irony, but in the wake of the loss has done her best to turn it into a positive.

'I guess this means that people will realize that I'm just a woman after all,' she said. 'I'm female. I'm human. Sometimes I dominate and sometimes I'm dominated.'
