Forget having your name printed on a wallet, or initials engraved on a briefcase, the latest in personalised gifts is much more scientific.

A team of Italian designers are selling bracelets engraved with the wearer’s DNA sequence.

By taking swabs from the inside of people’s mouths, experts turn the non-coding DNA into a long sequence of letters A, C, T and G.

Bracelets are expected to retail for £89 ($149), and that includes the price of the DNA kit

Materials: Rubber and polished iron, or brushed titanium

Length: 6.1 inches (155 mm) easily adjustable on all wrists; a bigger size of the bracelet will be also be available

Width: 0.78 inches (20mm)

Depth: 0.1 inches (2.5mm)

Weight: 1.05 ounces (30g)

Colours: It will be available in black, purple, blue, yellow, white, red, pink and green

Price: £89 ($149) with free shipping to Europe and Canada

To fund production of the swab kits and bracelets, Milan-based DNAME has launched a Kickstarter campaign, and has already achieved its £5,000 ($8,425) target.

Bracelets are expected to retail for £89 ($149), and that includes the price of the DNA kit.

According to the campaign, the scientists don’t engrave the entire DNA sequence; it only takes the non-coding information.

The human DNA sequence is made up of approximately three billion letters and each person has around 99.9 per cent in common. 

According to the campaign, the scientists don't engrave the entire DNA sequence; it only takes the non-coding information. The DNA sequence printed on the bracelets, pictured, only includes the letters that are unique to each individual wearer, and not the 99.9% they have in common with other humans

The DNA sequence printed on the bracelets only includes the letters that are unique to each individual wearer, so does not reveal a person’s entire decoded genome.

And the firm assures customers that nothing in the sequence it engraves reveals anything about the wearer’s health, sex, hair colour, height or body mass.

Each customer will be sent a kit for the DNA analysis at home and the sample is collected by rubbing the inside of the mouth using a cotton-tipped buccal swab.

The kit is then returned to the lab with the wearer’s authorisation that the experts are allowed to look at the results.

These results are decoded into the unique sequence of letters, and engraved on a bracelet made of iron or titanium. For security, DNAME said it ‘will never disclose data with anybody else.’

DNAME was founded by Mario Ricciardi, Giacomo Carloni, Luca Bernabè and Enrico Parise.

The group’s Kickstarter campaign ends on 25 May and bracelets will begin being shipped in August.

Shipping will be free in Europe and Canada.
