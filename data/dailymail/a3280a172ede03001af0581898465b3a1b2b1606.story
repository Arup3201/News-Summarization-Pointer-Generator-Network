Thrill-seekers will now have to pay as much at $105 to get into the park and stand in line for rides (pictured) 

One-day tickets for the Magic Kingdom currently cost $99 before tax and entrance to each of the other parks in the resort costs $94.

Disney has not confirmed the price increases and did not comment about the matter to the Orlando Sentinel. 

Price increases generally occur on Sundays. 

Former Disney executive Duncan Dickson said: 'We're getting ready to go into spring break. 

'It's race week [at Daytona International Speedway]. 

'You've got all those types of things happening, it's that time of year.'

The price increase at the resort (right) created thanks to Walt Disney (left) is expected to happen on Sunday 

The amusement park raised its ticket prices on February 23 last year, according to Theme Park Insider. 

The blog wrote: 'A Disney ticket price increase typically triggers a response from the Universal Orlando Resort.'

Single-day tickets to Universal Orlando are $96. 

General admission to Six Flags in Atlanta, Georgia is $61.99.

It is possible that prices will go up at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, as well.
