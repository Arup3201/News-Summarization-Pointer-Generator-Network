Liban Mohamed is currently in Somali custody after being named to the list of the FBI's most-wanted

A U.S. law enforcement official says a former taxi driver from northern Virginia included on the FBI's list of most-wanted terrorists has been detained in Somalia.

The official said 29-year-old Liban Mohamed is currently in Somali custody.

He would not describe what efforts would be made to bring Mohamed to the United States for trial.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he said he is not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation.

Mohamed is charged with providing material support to al-Qaeda and al-Shabab and is one of about 30 people on the terrorist list.

'Al Shabaab has claimed responsibility for many bombings in Somalia and Uganda and the 2013 attack on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya,' said Carl Ghattas, an agent in charge of the Counterterrorism Division at the time of his inclusion on the most-wanted list.

The FBI believes he left the U.S. in 2012.

He was placed on the list about a month ago.

Mohamed was formerly a cabdriver, The Washington Post reports, and is suspected of having helped in operations in al-Shabab as well as recruiting new members. 

Anonymous sources told the press he was well-versed regarding potential targets in Washington.

'While living in Northern Virginia, Mohamed was a recruiter and radicalizer for al Shabaab, which historically has targeted Westerners to go to Somalia and fight for them,' Ghattas said. 'Not only did Mohamed choose to go to Somalia and fight with al Shabaab, he took a prominent role in trying to recruit people and have them train with weapons.'

The former cab driver was said to have knowledge of several potential targets in Washington

He added: 'It is important for us to locate Mohamed because he has knowledge of the Washington, D.C. area’s infrastructure such as shopping areas, Metro, airports, and government buildings. This makes him an asset to his terrorist associates who might plot attacks on U.S. soil.'

A $50,000 reward was put out for information leading to his capture. 

Attorney Gadeir Abbas has represented Mohamed's family on separate matters.

He declined to comment.

While the U.S. has no extradition treaty with Somalia efforts are underway to bring Mohamed back to Virginia.
