The father of a little girl trapped under 25 feet of dirt while playing with her cousin desperately pleaded with authorities to hurry after he witnessed the accident last night, according to a newly-released 911 call.

Distraught dad Jordan Arwood can be heard sobbing as he tells the dispatcher: 'Get everybody you can, l mean everybody.'

The call was released hours after workers have recovered the bodies of six-year-old Chloe Jade Arwood and seven-year-old James Levi Caldwell, who were buried alive under dirt at a construction site in North Carolina on Sunday afternoon.

As the operator asks Mr Arwood to stop shouting and give her an address, he says: 'Please hurry... My children are buried under tons of dirt... They're buried under tons of clay... It fell on top of them.'

He added: 'The entire wall collapsed on them. Get a crane. Get a bulldozer. Get anything you can, please. There's no way they can breathe.'

The 911 call was released by authorities on Monday to CBS News.

Bad news: Fire and rescue personnel walk to the end of the road where two children died in Stanley

Denver Fire Department public 
information officer Dion Burleson told The Associated Press on Sunday 
that the effort had changed from a rescue effort to a 
recovery effort.

Mr Arwood 
was reportedly in the process of digging out the basement of the 
unfinished home when the children were caught in the collapse.

WCNC reported that
 the children were in a basement under construction when a dirt wall fell on 
them.

Neighbors told theÂ Charlotte Observer that Mr Arwood lives on the land with his parents and several children.

On Monday, authorities removed several guns and a marijuana plant from the property, according to CBS. Mr Arwood, who was arrested for drug possession in 2003, was not supposed to have firearms.

Lincoln County Planning & Inspections Department official Andrew Bryant told the network that no permits had been issued where Mr Arwood had been digging.

Horror: The hole at the construction site was believed to be about 20 to 25 feet deep

Rescuers from several nearby areas were on scene within minutes, but could not reach the children.

The stations said firefighters
 were using shovels and climbing gear to try to get the children out. 
Video from WSOC shows backhoes scooping dirt from a deep hole surrounded
 by dirt.

Their bodies were recovered around 8am on Monday.

'There are calls at times like this happen where we are not able to make a difference because it's outside of our realm,' said Burleson, choking up slightly.

'This is one of those cases, and it's devastating to not only to the family, but each and every one of the responders that is out here.'

One neighbor, 
Sybil Johnson, told WCNC that she tried to comfort one of the 
victim's younger siblings before the bodies were found.

'They kept saying,
 "They have been down there too long without air",' Johnson said. 'That 
is what the little kids were saying up here. I told them, "God will take
 care of them".'
