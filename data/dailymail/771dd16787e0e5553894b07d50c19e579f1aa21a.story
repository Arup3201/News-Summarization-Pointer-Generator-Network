Some people would love to be wake up to the smell of freshly ground coffee or a hearty bacon butty on a cold morning instead of their alarm.

But now there's an app that can release a favourite aroma at the same time as a phone clock alarm or when an individual receives a text message.

The Scentee app also claims to be able to change the taste of food with its mini air-freshener-like cartridges that clip into a phone.

The idea is that as scent influences humans' perception of taste, by smelling a different aroma such as steak or curry while eating bland food, the body can be tricked into believing it is eating a much tastier dinner.

A user can select to emit a puff of 
scent at will using the small plastic device, which also sprays a tiny 
amount of scent into the air if they have set up an alarm.

A playful video by the company suggests that students could use the small device to pretend they are eating luxurious dinners when they are actually re-fueling by eating a bowl of bland rice.

It also shows a girl on a diet who uses the device to sniff some sizzling meat while munching on substantially less calorific and exciting lettuce leaves.

Users of the app can choose between a number of aromas including different cuts of meat and a buttered potato (pictured)

The small device, that is on sale in Japan, plugs into a smartphone. A user can select to emit a puff of scent at will using the small plastic device, which also sprays a tiny amount of scent into the air if they have set up an alarm or text message alert

Individuals can also use the Scentee app to create scent notifications for alerts like emails, Facebook messages and text messages.

A promotional video for the app suggests that users might like to choose a fragrance that they associate with a certain person so that the air can smell of roses when a partner gets in touch.

The small plastic device, which costs 3,480 Yen (approximately £22) plugs into the stereo sockets on Apple iPads and iPhones as well as certain Android handsets, is on sale in Japan.

Once the device is fitted to the phone, users can select a scented cartridge from floral scents like lavender and jasmine, to food ranging from strawberries and coffee to curry and bacon.

The company says its 'scent catalogue' is designed to suit a person's mood.

The Scentee device lights up when it is activated with 7 coloured LEDs and can be set off on a whim.

Users of the app and device can choose from lots of cartridges for their device. Each cartridge costs around £3.15 and lasts for 100 puffs of scent

The company said users can 'enjoy new feelings of 4D communication' with the device that is rechargeable and can be on standby for 24 hours on a single charge.

It said that uses for its device include: 'scented notifications for emails and 
Facebook likes and even timer scents that work with your phone clock 
alarm to ease you into the day with a favorite aroma.'

Each cartridge costs 525 yen (around £3.15) and contains enough scent for around 100 sprays.
