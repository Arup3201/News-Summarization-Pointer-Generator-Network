A shocking video has surfaced of a severely autistic Virginia boy being hit, kicked and choked by a school bus driver and special education aide.

Alice Holland and Mary Evans were both convicted of assaulting Timothy Kilpatrick, who was aged 11 at the time of the attacks in September 2009.

Now Timothy’s family have opened a $20million injury and negligence lawsuit against the Bedford County school board, Holland and Evans.

Autistic boy: Alice Holland and Mary Evans were both convicted of assaulting Timothy Kilpatrick, who was aged 11 at the time of the attacks in September 2009

Shocking: The CCTV video shows driver Holland and aide Evans hitting the crying boy with a fly swatter as he tries to protect himself

Holland served just one month of a 12-month sentence and Evans served only two months of a 12-month sentence, court records said.

The video shows the crying boy being hit with a fly swatter as he tries to protect himself, reported the Huffington Post.

Timothy was helplessly isolated in his seat with tight harnesses on each shoulder, reported the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

The boy can hardly speak and weighed 190lbs at the time of the attack.

‘This is a lawsuit that brings up 
important questions about the safety of our children,’ family lawyer P. 
Brent Brown told WDBJ 7.

'That video shows the fear of every 
parent in Virginia about what happens to their autistic child when they 
leave home and are in school'

Both Holland and Evans ceased to be employed by the county school system soon after the horrific abuse came to light in 2009.

But Mr Brown claimed Timothy’s father told
school officials one year previously he was worried about abuse when his son was hurt on a bus.

‘That video shows the fear of every 
parent in Virginia about what happens to their autistic child when they 
leave home and are in school,’ John H. Maloney of Autism Speaks said.

‘It shows everyone's worst nightmare,’ he told the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

'Going to school should not hurt. Our children should not have to fear for their safety when they get on the school bus. It's just horrendous'

Colleen 
Miller, Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy

Henrico County politician Jimmie Massie 
said he will introduce legislation for specific training of aides caring
for autistic children.

‘Going to school should not hurt,’ Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy executive director Colleen Miller told WSET ABC 13.

‘Our children should not have to fear for their safety when they get on the school bus. It's just horrendous.’
