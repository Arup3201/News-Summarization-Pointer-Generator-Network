In-demand Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba believes his transfer value is worthless if he doesn't perform every single time he steps out on to the pitch.

The former Manchester United youngster is already viewed as one of the best all-round midfielders in Europe, despite being only 21.

United, who let Pogba leave for Turin on a free in July 2012, have been linked with a move for the midfielder while Sportsmail revealed in December that Manchester City were also mooting a club-record £40million bid for the star as a replacement for Yaya Toure. 

Highly-rated Juventus star Paul Pogba believes his value is worth 'zero euros' if he doesn't perform well

Pogba enhanced his reputation further with a superb strike to open the scoring in Juventus' 4-0 win against Verona in Serie A on Sunday night. 

Yet despite another stellar performance, the France international was rather modest about his transfer valuation.

'I am worth zero euros. I am worth nothing unless I work on the field in every single game,' he told reporters.

'I need to do more because I want to be a champion just like Gianluigi Buffon, Andrea Pirlo and Giorgio Chiellini.

'I want to be one of the best players in the world and to be able to reach this level, I need to play well. I focus on working on the pitch and giving all I've got for the squad.'

Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri was pleased with the 21-year-old's display against Verona and believes the midfielder is a potential future world player of the year.

'Pogba is young, even though we treat him like a veteran,' Allegri said.

'Ballon d'Or? I think you would need to win a Champions League, European Championship or World Cup, but he's got the potential to get there.'

The former AC Milan boss added: 'He needs to understand that certain things can only be done in certain areas of the pitch, but he put in a great display against Verona.'

Pogba has scored seven goals in 24 appearances this season for Juventus, including three in his last three matches.
