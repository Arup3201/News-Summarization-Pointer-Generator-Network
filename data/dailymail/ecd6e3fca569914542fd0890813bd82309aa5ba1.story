Vice President Joe Biden has been a non-factor in the debt and budget fight so far. The last news wire photos of him came ten days ago, and he hasn't made any public statements about the standoff that has gripped Washington

If Republicans were bluffing over Obamacare and the debt ceiling, it's now the Democrats' turn to play high-stakes poker. And the notoriously gaffe-prone Joe Biden has been called back from his Camp David vacation to put the screws on the GOP.

The White House issued a statement on Monday saying that Obama would remind congressional leaders in the Oval Office at 3:00 p.m. that he 'will not pay a ransom for Congress reopening the government and raising the debt limit.'

That meeting was postponed about 20 minutes before it was scheduled to begin. The White House released a statement saying the action was taken 'to allow leaders in the Senate time to continue making important progress towards a solution that raises the debt limit and reopens the government.

Some observers are saying the hastily scheduled meeting will be a session of liars' poker whose stakes are half fiscal and half political.

'This whole shutdown has been completely unnecessary,' Obama told reporters during an unscheduled stop Monday afternoon at a Washington, D. C. soup kitchen, complaining that ''we've seen this brinksmanship time and time again to try and extract extreme partisan concessions.'

Democrats had succeeded in pushing 
Republicans off of their earlier bluff in which they threatened to keep 
the government closed and risk a debt default unless the president 
accepted significant changes to the Obamacare law.

Now
 the political left is demanding its own concessions, including a 
long-term extension of the debt ceiling that would push off the next 
fiscal precipice until after the 2014 midterm elections.

Putting meat in the sandwich: Obama was due to meet party leaders at the White House in a bid to finally resolve the deadlock after spending the morning at a D.C. foodbank

Hard to swallow: Republicans will be angered by the bold demand from the Democrats after Obama has for the last month said he would not pay a 'ransom'

Democrats
 are also insisting that when the government reopens, it must be a 
short-term fix. They want a chance to revisit the budget and increase 
federal spending, according to a senior Democratic House aide.

'The Republicans are cutting the 
budget to the bone,' the staffer said on Monday. 'We're not going to 
jeopardize Social Security funding or Medicare because the GOP 
wants to please its radical tea party base.'

But Republicans counter that Reid, 
the Democrats' leader in the Senate, would balloon government spending 
far beyond what both houses of Congress agreed to in 2011, and even 
further past what the January sequester agreement permits.

Sen.
 Tom Barrasso told Fox News on Monday that Reid wants to see the federal
 government spending 'a million dollars a minute for the next year.'

Reid has told reporters that he hopes to arrive in the Oval Office with a deal proposal in hand. In addition to the long-term debt limit hike and the short-term leash to reopen the government, it will provide a delay – not a repeal – of an unpopular Obamacare-related medical device tax. 

Democrats are also reportedly willing to consider income-verification procedures for Americans claiming Obamacare's generous subsidies, but they insist that Republicans will have to make additional concessions in return. Those, Senate sources told MailOnline, would most likely be related to entitlement spending levels.

Sen. John McCain quipped Sunday on 'Face The Nation' that Vice President Joe Biden, who has been all but invisible despite his decades in the U.S. Senate, must be somewhere in the federal witness protection program

While it's unclear how Republicans will react, Biden will be there to help Reid get what he wants.

Both sides of the Senate clash said Monday afternoon before the White House meeting that they were making significant progress.

'We have had an opportunity over the last couple of days to have some very constructive exchanges of views about how to move forward,' Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor. 'Those discussions continue, and I share [the] optimism that we’re going to get a result that will be acceptable to both sides.'

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid signaled his agreement, saying that 'constructive, good faith negotiations continue between the Republican leader and me.'

'I'm very optimistic that we will reach an agreement that's reasonable in nature this week to reopen the government, pay the nation's bills and begin long term negotiations to put our country on sound fiscal footing.'

Reid and the Democrats want to reopen the government for only a few months, giving them the change to strong-arm Republicans into accepting still more government spending

President Obama (C) met on Saturday with Senate Democratic leaders (L to R) Dick Durbin, Chuck Shumer, Harry Reid and Patty Murray, but Joe Biden was MIA

Republican Sen. John McCain 
complained during a Sunday television appearance that President Obama 
has been a non-factor in the negotiations, and that Biden, who spent 
decades in the Senate and has a reputation as a dealmaker, has been 
nowhere in sight.

'I hope 
the president will become engaged. Maybe we need to get Joe Biden out of
 the witness protection program,' McCain told host Bob Schieffer.

But the vice president will join Obama and the four most senior congressional leaders in a meeting whose agenda will be driven by Democrats.

Reid and McConnell will be on hand with House Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

As the Treasury Department's debt funding deadline approaches just three days from now, it's Democrats who suddenly have the wind at their backs and leverage in their pockets.

On Capitol Hill, an aide to a senior Senate Republican was overheard talking to his boss during a walk through a Senate office building on Monday.

'Unless we hold the line on spending,' the staffer said, 'we're going to end up losing ground instead of gaining it. We've got to make sure Mitch [McConnell] gets that.'

'I'm still not sure who put us in this box,' added the aide, 'but we're in it.'
