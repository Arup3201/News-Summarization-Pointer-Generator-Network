A pregnant mum says she was ordered to surrender two jars of Nutella at London City Airport because staff claimed the chocolate spread posed a terror risk.

Kara Harrison became upset when staff at a security checkpoint ordered her to hand over the jars which she was carrying in her hand luggage at the airport in east London.

The 35-year-old says a worker told her the chocolate spread breached liquid restrictions and could not be carried onto the plane.

According to the official guidance, gels, liquids and pastes must be in containers of 100ml or less. These can include:

Kara, a home economics teacher, said: ‘They told me the chocolate was dangerous and had to be confiscated. I was distraught.’

She and her husband, Iain, were flying home to Scotland after a short break in London, where they spent the weekend sightseeing, shopping and attending a concert.

Among the highlights was a visit to Selfridges department store in Oxford Street, where shoppers can buy special jars of Nutella with their names on the label. They're so popular queues often bring the shop to a standstill.

Kara, from South Queensferry near Edinburgh, bought one jar for her three-year-old son, Ewan, and another for work colleague Elaine.

She was so pleased with her festive purchases she even posed for a picture in front of the Nutella display in the store.

But festive spirit was sadly lacking when the couple got to London City Airport for their flight home.

Kara said: ‘We'd packed everything into our hand luggage so that we would be quick getting on the flight, but as we watched the bags go through the scanner, we realised something was wrong.’

Staff called Kara to one side and asked her to open her bag. Pointing to the two jars, they asked what they were.

A spokesman for London City Airport said it adheres to rules set out by the Department for Transport

‘I explained that they were Nutella spread and that they were Christmas presents. But they said that as they were a liquid they'd have to be confiscated.

‘It seemed completely daft. It was obvious what they were and that they didn't pose a security threat.’

As they waited in the departure lounge, Kara's anger turned to tears, and she had to be consoled by Iain.

She said: ‘I know it seems daft, but I'm feeling a wee bit sensitive at the moment because I'm pregnant, and it is nearly Christmas.’

Current rules require all liquids, pastes or gels to be stored in containers no larger than 100ml

A spokesman for London City Airport said it adheres to rules set out by the Department for Transport.

Current rules require all liquids in containers over 100ml in size, including large bottles of water, lotions and perfume, to be stored in luggage in an aircraft’s hold.

If large containers are found in a traveller’s hand luggage they will likely be thrown in the bin.

The rule was implemented in 2006 after authorities foiled a terror plot to use liquid explosives to blow up several aircraft travelling from Heathrow to the US and Canada.

But it is the European Commission’s goal to lift the ban and screen all liquids, lotions, powders, pastes and gels by January 2016 using laser scanning technology.
