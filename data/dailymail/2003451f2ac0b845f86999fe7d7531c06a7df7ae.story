Human trafficking charges against a Saudi princess accused of holding a Kenyan servant as a virtual prisoner in her California home were dismissed by a judge today, after prosecutors said they were unable to corroborate the allegations.

The 42-year-old princess, Meshael Alayban, smiled broadly as she left the Santa Ana courtroom after the judge lifted her $5 million bond, returned her passports to her and ordered that an electronic monitoring device be removed.

Alayban had been charged with bringing her accuser to the United States in May, confiscating her passport and paying her $220 a month to work 16 hours a day, seven days a week in circumstances Orange County's top prosecutor likened to slavery.

But during a five-minute court proceeding that had been scheduled as an arraignment, District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told the judge, 'The allegations cannot be corroborated, the people move to dismiss.'

The judge agreed, and defense lawyer Paul Meyer said in court, 'On behalf of the court and the nation of Saudi Arabia, we thank the D.A. for being a man of integrity.'

Alayban, a wife of Saudi Prince Abdulrahman bin Nasser bin Abdulaziz al Saud, who is the grandson of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia was arrested in July.

She was taken from her apartment in suburban Irvine, southeast of Los Angeles, and charged with human trafficking.

Authorities said the case came to light after the Kenyan woman, who is about 30 years old, escaped from the residence and flagged down a bus driver.

After Friday's hearing, District Attorney Rackauckas said the evidence from his investigation showed that 'the victim here was not really a victim,' adding that contrary to the accuser's account, she was free to come and go and received needed medical care.

'I think she believed she was a victim. I don't think she was lying to us. I think it was a misunderstanding and miscommunication,' he said.

But defense lawyer Meyer said the accuser's claims were 'based on lies' and he issued a statement calling the allegations 'a scam to gain permanent resident status in the United States.'

Defence attorney Jennifer L. Keller said in July that the family would pay
for a $10,000 first-class ticket on emirates because: ' The family 
would have felt guilty if they were in the back.'

She said that servants had access to cellphones, Facebook and television channels in their language.

The statement added that they were able to use the pool, gym, spa and would go shopping that was paid for by the family.

The princess posted bail of $5 
million on July 11. She had to wear a GPS tracking device and could not leave 
Orange County without court approval.

Alayban appeared in
an Orange County court in July dressed in a blue jumpsuit and 
answered the judge from behind grilled bars.

Uttering
'yes, your honor' several times during her time in the Santa Ana 
courtroom, Alayban, 42, was aided by an Arabic-speaking interpreter 
during the proceedings.

The
Kenyan woman, who was being held in a shelter, claimed she escaped 
from the Santa Ana property where she worked for Alayban and boarded a 
bus where she explained her plight to a passenger who helped her phone 
police.

In addition to the Kenyan woman, 
police said that when officers executed a search warrant for Alayban's 
home, they discovered four women from the Philippines also working in 
similar circumstances.

All five of the women's 
passports had been confiscated and placed in a bank safe deposit box 
which they allegedly did not have access to.

They added that Alayban was arrested due to their belief a criminal case could be pursued against her.

However, they added that the investigation into the four other women was ongoing 'to see if criminal charges are appropriate to any other individuals.'

All five women are said to be in 
good health. No indications of physical abuse were found and were being 
assisted with finding housing at a shelter.

The
other four women left the home voluntarily with police once authorities
arrived. They told police they were interested in being free, Maggard 
said.

No charges have been filed in connection with their circumstances.
