A former middle school principal who lost his job over a drug arrest went on a rampage Friday, stabbing several people - killing at least two - and then drove his car into a crowded porch, authorities said.

Anthony Giancola, 45, apparently told his mother before the carnage that he was ‘going to kill all the drug dealers,’ Pinellas Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said. 

Then, covered in blood, Giancola again phoned his mother saying that she’d be very proud of him because he just killed 10 drug dealers, according to Sheriff Gualtieri.

Authorities said there were 11 victims in all around Lealman, Florida, and that several are being treated at area hospitals for injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening.

Sheriff Gualtieri said Giancola told his mother in the morning that he was 'going to kill all the drug dealers,’ and told her that she’d be proud of him for killing ’10 drug dealers,' according to WTSP.

The horrific crime spree began shortly before 11 a.m. in the small city of Lealman in Pinellas County, about 20 miles west of Tampa.

Authorities say that's when Giancola went to a halfway house for the hearing impaired, where officials said he stabbed four people, killing a man and a woman.

Of the two wounded, one person was reported to be in serious condition. A 9-year-old girl who lived there was not home at the time, said neighbours who were stunned by the day's events.

'It's crazy,' Ken Seidl, 52, told the AP. He lives down the street from the group home. 'There's always problems in this neighbourhood, drugs, prostitution. But never nothing this drastic.'

Patching together: Officers can be seen outside of one of the crime scenes talking; in total, there were 11 victims, with many in critical condition

Pinellas County Sheriff's spokeswoman Cecelia Barreda said officers are still piecing together the timeline.

'It appears at this moment, this is all random,' said Barreda, stressing that the details of the story could change throughout the evening.

However, she said, investigators believe that after the stabbings at around 11:30a.m., Giancola pulled up in front of a house in the nearby city of Pinellas Park and asked residents where he could find women. 

The residents told him to go away, and Giancola drove away angry. He soon returned and crashed his car into their porch, injuring three women and one man, police said.

The women were taken to a nearby hospital, but the man refused treatment.

Giancola also hit a 13-year-old boy on a bike as he was fleeing, officials said. The boy's injuries were minor.

Shameful past: In 2007, Giancola, the then-principal of Van Buren Middle School, made a deal to buy $20 worth of crack cocaine in his office Thursday while students were still on campus

Soon after, investigators reported that Giancola went to the Kenvins Motel in Pinellas Park, where he used a microwave to attack the married couple who own the motel.

Kanu and Indiranden Patel, both 57, were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. The husband is in critical condition, officials said.

By that time, officers had spoken with victims that were able to communicate and had pieced together the name of the suspect, Barreda said. A police dog tracked Giancola near a storage facility and that's where he was arrested.

Giancola was first arrested in 2007.

Authorities said he bought $20 of crack cocaine from an undercover police officer during the school day in his office at Van Buren Middle School in Tampa. 

Giancola eventually pleaded guilty to purchasing crack cocaine, possessing crack cocaine and possessing marijuana. Court records show he was sentenced to a year in jail and three years of probation.

A message left at a telephone listing for Giancola seeking comment from his family wasn't immediately returned, and it wasn't clear if he had an attorney.

He was charged arrested for two-counts first degree murder and two counts attempted first degree murder, according to the police report.
