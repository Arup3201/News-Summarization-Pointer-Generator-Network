Nicolas Sarkozy's first round defeat in the French presidential elections has contributed to a fall in the FTSE

The UK stock market tumbled today 
after investors became spooked by political uncertainty in France and 
the Netherlands and over a new recession in Spain.

Nicolas Sarkozy was beaten in the first round of the French presidential elections by socialist rival Francois Hollande, who plans to renegotiate an agreement on limiting government spending to tackle the debt crisis.

In Holland, prime minister Mark Rutte tendered his government's resignation, paving the way for early elections after a minority party refused to back austerity plans.

The turmoil wiped Â£27.6 billion from the value of the FTSE 100 Index. It fell nearly 2 per cent, or 106.6 points to 5665.6, while markets in Europe suffered sharper falls.

Yields
on government debt - a reflection of the extra risk premium demanded by
investors to lend to states - were on the rise again.

The
10-year yield on Spanish bonds was a whisker under 6 per cent - a 
crucial psychological level for the markets - at 5.95 per cent while 
Italy's bonds traded at 5.71 per cent.

The
yield on France's 10-year bonds were marginally higher at 3.08 per cent
while Dutch bonds traded up 10 basis points to 2.41 per cent.

Concerns are now growing of a re-run of the eurozone concerns that sparked a global stock market sell-off last summer.

Resignation expected: Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has called an emergency cabinet meeting after budget talks collapsed

Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG Index, said: 'One potential change of government in the eurozone is bad enough, but with the Dutch government falling apart as well, investors have been well and truly spooked.'

To add to the gloom, Germany's manufacturing sector shrank at its fastest rate for nearly three years, and China's manufacturing sector continued to decline, albeit at a slower pace than previously.

Banks were among the biggest fallers in London, with Barclays down 4 per cent, and taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds down 4 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.

Shavaz Dhalla, a trader at Spreadex, said: 'Dismay could be a term used to describe global markets this afternoon as a series of poor economic data from the eurozone, exacerbated by news indicating that the Dutch government was close to collapse, brought global markets to their knees.

'This, coupled with the uncertainty regarding the potential for a new but less eurozone-friendly French president, caused investors to flee in the face of uncertainty.'

Reacting to news from the eurozone: The FTSE fell in early trading, a trend that continued until lunch time today

The prospect that Mr Sarkozy will fail to win re-election spooked markets because he has been a staunch ally of German chancellor Angela Merkel, who has spearheaded the drive to hammer out an agreement to limit government spending.

All but two of the 27 countries in the European Union signed up to the 'fiscal compact', with the UK among those to abstain.

Enforcing austerity on the eurozone 
at a time when it is struggling to grow is likely to prove difficult, 
with Spain and Italy already having to let deficit-reduction targets 
slip.

David Miller, a partner at Cheviot 
Asset Management, said: 'If Sarkozy had won comfortably yesterday, it 
would have been business as usual, with France and Germany trying to 
hold the eurozone together.

'However, the new prospect of a new 
president and new approach to dealing with the eurozone crisis has made 
investors and European markets nervous.

'We'll see muddled markets until the final result is declared.'

Meanwhile, in Holland, Mr Rutte 
failed to get support from a right-wing party for budget cuts that would
bring the deficit under the EU limit of 3 per cent of gross domestic 
product.

The political crisis could lead to 
the collapse of the government and risks the country losing its prized 
triple-A rating, pushing up the rate at which the country can borrow 
money.

Spain's central bank says the country
is now in a technical recession as the economy contracted 0.4 per cent 
in the first quarter of the year following a 0.3 per cent decline in the
previous quarter.

The government has said the economy is shrinking and forecasts it will contract 1.7 per cent this year.
