The Pope showed he has a sense of humour as well as a caring side today when he donned a red nose at the wedding of members of a charity that uses clowns to cheer up children.

Pope Francis appeared at the Vatican to congratulate the newlyweds from the Rainbow Association Marco Iagulli Onlus who were getting married there.

As the pair came down the steps, he took the opportunity to show his support for the charity by donning the universal symbol of comedy.

Francis is fast becoming well known for his informal manner, which has landed him in situations that would have been unthinkable to his predecessors.

He has posed opened an account on the popular photo-sharing site Instagram, posed for selfies with worshippers after mass and, just seven days ago, barely batted an eyelid when a youngster leapt on stage at the Vatican.

Apparently unperturbed by the huge audience, the boy happily stood next to Pope Francis on the stage in St Peter's Square and then hugged his leg.

Cool as a cucumber, the Pontiff responded by patting him on the head and carrying on with his speech.

Buenos Aires-born Pope Francis began his papacy in March this year after the shock resignation of Pope Benedict XVI who resigned a month earlier.

He has apparently set about making the Catholic church more relevant to the modern era, asking questions of centuries-old doctrines like the celibacy of priests, opposition to homosexuality and contraception, and the secondary position of women in the church.

In a series of breaks with protocol, he has telephoned worshippers who have left him letters, established Vatican sports teams, donated money to hard up pensioners and offered personally to baptise the child of a woman who had refused her partner's demands she have an abortion.

Last month he again showcased his lively sense of humour when he stopped the Popemobile to try on a firefighter's helmet in front of a Vatican crowd.

So today's episode was merely what Catholics have come to expect from their dynamic new Pope.

Rainbow Association Marco Iagulli Onlus, the charity the newly-married couple are associated with, runs clown therapy sessions for children with cancer in hospitals, nursing homes and orphanages.

It also offers economic and practical support for their families.

Its website says: 'The association was founded with the aim to provide support, both moral, psychological and economic (where possible) to the families whose children are suffering from the cancer.

'The weekly trips, specialist visits, medical advice and hotels stays for the parents of patients involve troubles and expenses.

'The happy life of a child who just want to play, go to school or do what any child of that age would do, together with the life of the family, are rudely interrupted and often destroyed through an ordeal endless and excruciating.

'And it is at this precise moment that our association tries to help out.'
