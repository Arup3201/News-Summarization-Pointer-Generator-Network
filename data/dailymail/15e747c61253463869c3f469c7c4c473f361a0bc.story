An Oklahoma man has been charged in his aunt's shooting death, telling investigators that he killed the woman to put an end to their incestuous sexual relationship.

Mayes County Sheriff Mike Reed said the body of Verna Sarten, 50, was found around 1am Monday by deputies responding to a report of a woman not breathing at the house.

Deputies later pulled over the victim's nephew and roommate, 37-year-old Jeremy Sappington, who was driving her pickup truck, and took him into custody. He is now facing a first-degree murder charge.

Grisly crime scene: A sheriff's deputy discovered Sarten's body bloodied and naked from the waist down lying on the floor of her home in Chouteau, Oklahoma

According to prosecutors, Sappington shot Sarten in the head with a .22 caliber revolver at her home in the 1400 block of East Jones Street in Chouteau, and then burned a stack of papers with the apparent intent to start a fire before fleeing, Tulsa World reported. 

When an officer responded to a call from Sarten's relative asking to check up on her just before 1am, he walked inside the house and immediately discovered the woman's bloodied body on the floor next to the couch.

Court documents stated that Sarten’s pajama pants and underwear were cast aside on the floor, and there was blood on her face and the carpet.

The oven was on with its door ajar and the central heating system was also switched on, according to the affidavit.  

Jeremy Sappington was initially arrested on suspicion of public intoxication when sheriff's deputies responded to reports of a disturbance on West 590th Street.

When police searched the Dodge pickup Sappington was driving, they discovered an H & R .22 caliber revolver and a spent shell under the driver's seat.

It was later determined that the vehicle belonged to Verna Sarten's boyfriend, Gerald Howard, who was out of town at the time of the killing.

During questioning Monday, Sappington allegedly confessed to the murder, telling deputies that he was having sex with Sarten, his mother's sister, in exchange for housing.

The 37-year-old suspect told the deputies that he wanted to break things off with his aunt, so he grabbed a gun that Sarten had been hiding under her mattress, walked up behind her and fired a shot at her head.

According to her obituary, Miss Sarten, a certified nursing assistant and avid gardener, is survived by four grown children and seven grandchildren.

Sarten's niece - and Sappington's sister - Susan Austin Kerr, who lives in Georgia, told Tulsa World that she and her brother had a rough upbringing, and things only got worse after the passing of their mother, Veta, in 1984.

As a teenager, Sappington often got in trouble and was in and out of juvenile detention centers.

Pryor Daily Times reported that Sappington moved in with his aunt and her boyfriend after his divorce.

Assistant District Attorney Marny Hill said that after Sarten’s shooting, her nephew headed over to his ex-wife’s house, banging on the doors and windows.

Sappington is being held without bond due to his extensive criminal record, which includes drug possession, armed robbery, assault, domestic assault and battery, and multiple auto theft charges, according to the station News On 6.

He had been sentenced to seven years in prison for attempted larceny of an automobile.
