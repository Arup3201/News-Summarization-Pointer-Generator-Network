Heather Mills has dramatically quit the UK disabled skiing team after allegedly 'lunging' at an official who told her she couldn't wear a specially-adapted boot.

Sir Paul McCartney's ex-wife reportedly screamed 'you bitch, you bitch' at Sylvana Mestre who is technical head at the International Paralympic Committee after she was told the boot she was wearing for a competition in Pitztal, Austria, wasn't approved by the organisation.

According to sources at the IPC, the 45-year-old had to be restrained by staff and threatened to have the IPC official sacked.

Coach Branislav Mazgut saw the incident and told the paper she was red in the face and went to push the official.

Out of the competition: Heather Mills announced she was not going to compete at the Paralympics

This morning, the BBC reports the International Paralympic Committee may take disciplinary action against Heather Mills.

They say she 'verbally abused' and 'physically harassed' the official.

The mother-of-one was preparing herself for the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games after she was offered a trial on the ski team's development squad in 2010.

She was about to qualify for a place in next year's Paralympic Games but says she was told she would be disqualified.

She was told she must wear a cover 
over her boot and prosthetic leg to comply with international rules.

In a statement, she said she was withdrawing and said the boot she would have to wear would add weight and was painful.

Despite 
Mills’ World Cup skiing success, she struggled through her 
qualification for the Paralympics – with problems including being 
‘ejected’ from her prosthetic leg when practising slalom.

In the 
summer, she had a new leg and boot design created by London Prosthetics 
Centre to help reduce the problem.

Mills’
management said that wearing the boot cover, which locks to her left 
leg below the knee, causes a large amount of friction, painful 
inflammation and blisters.

Competing: Heather Mills competing in the women's slalom in New Zealand this year

Resort: She was told the boot she was wearing for a competition in Pitztal, Austria, wasn't approved

Competition: Heather Mills, who lost half her leg in 1993, stands with first place winner Melanie Schwartzc after competing in the Women's Slalom in New Zealand in August of this year

Mills lost her left leg below the knee in 1993 after she was knocked down by a police motorcycle.

She set up the Heather Mills Trust which helps people who have lost limbs to landmines.

She married former Beatle Sir Paul in June 2002 but split four years later in 2006.

After her divorce in 2008, she began skiing and preparing for the Winter Paralympic Games in Sochi, Russia, in 2014. She is ranked 28th in the world in slalom.

Last year it was reported that she had bought a chalet near Goldeck am Millstätter See, in the Austrian Alps, for £1.4million as a base for her training.

But it wasn't long after her training began that she was involved in her first accident which saw her break her right shoulder blade in several places and be airlifted to hospital by helicopter.

Mills then had another accident - this time injuring her leg.

She was then told that she would need to rest for five weeks before resuming her training, but the injury scares didn't put her off.

A spokeswoman for the Dancing on Ice star said she was unable to comment as she was in hospital with an injury.
