Morgan Schneiderlin is claiming he has a gentleman’s agreement with Southampton that will force through his move to Tottenham.

Schneiderlin insists this was in place when he signed a new four-year contract in February 2013. 

Although the 24-year-old, who earns £45,000 a week, signed his new deal under a previous regime, he insists the club should honour a verbal commitment.

The Southampton midfielder is determined to link up with ex- boss Mauricio Pochettino at White Hart Lane. Tottenham would spend around £15m to sign him and have been made aware of Schneiderlin’s claim.

Southampton, now under new coach Ronald Koeman, insist he will not be sold.

Koeman has a number of other issues to deal with as he prepares for their opening Premier League fixture at Liverpool on Sunday.

Goalkeeper Artur Boruc is furious after he was told Fraser Forster is the new first choice. Boruc will ask to leave if Forster plays at Anfield.
