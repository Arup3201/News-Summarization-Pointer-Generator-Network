'beaten to death': Joele Leotta was killed just six days after moving to the UK

An Italian waiter was beaten to death by a gang of Eastern European migrants in a row over loud music just six days after he moved to the UK, a court heard.

Joele Leotta, 20, moved to Maidstone, Kent, from northern Italy with his best friend Alex Galbiati, 20, a jury was told, but died less than a week after arriving.

A murder trial at Maidstone Crown Court heard how five Lithuanians broke down the door of the pair's flat, burst in and attacked both of them last October.

The men - Aleksandras Zuravliovas, 26,  Tomas Gelezinis, 31, Saulius Tamoliunas, 24, and Linas Zidonis, 21 - allegedly carried out the brutal beating because they thought one of the men had complained to their landlord over loud music.

Prosecutors said Mr Galbiati tried to fight back with a metal wardrobe railing, but it was wrestled from his hands and used to beat him.

He barricaded himself into the bathroom, the court heard, but his attackers broke in and kept attacking him until he pretended to have been knocked unconscious.

After the three-minute attack ended, he found Mr Leotta lying unconscious at the bottom of the stairs that led into the flat.

The jury 
was played a distressing clip of Mr Galbiati's 999 call in which he 
could be heard crying and struggling to speak English as he pleaded for 
help.

The controller patched in a translator to help with the call but Mr Galbiati struggled to respond.

Mr
 Leotta went into cardiac arrest at 11.45pm and died from head injuries 
at Kingâ€™s College Hospital in London three hours later.

Philippa McAtasney QC, prosecuting, said: 'The prosecution suggest that any bad feeling that might have existed on the part of any of the defendants towards the Italian victims must have been harboured by Gelezinis.

'He was the one who was in the danger of being evicted. For what it is worth, the complaint had come from someone else.'

Scene: Joele Leotta was allegedly killed by five Lithuanians in his flat in Maidstone Kent. Police were seen outside after his death

'Music row': The court heard that the Lithuanians may have wrongly believed that Mr Leotta or his flatmate had complained about noise levels

Mr Galbiati armed himself with a metal wardrobe rail but said an attacker grabbed the weapon and used it to strike him.

Maidstone Crown Court heard how after the initial beating Mr Galbiati barricaded himself in the bathroom.

But two men forced the door and began to hit him with the metal pole.

The victim said the ordeal lasted three minutes and only stopped when he pretended to faint.

He emerged when everything went quiet and discovered Mr Leotta lying at the bottom of the stairs at the front entrance to the building.

All the defendants have denied murder and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

The trial continues.
