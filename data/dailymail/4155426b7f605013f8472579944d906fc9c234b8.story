While most bars and eateries love a good review to drive business, there are always exceptions to the rule.

A Japanese bar is shunning modern-day marketing techniques, preferring a more unorthodox approach.

The Osaka bar has taken offence to a food-lovers website and is pursuing legal action, arguing publicity actually hurts its strategy of being discreet and exclusive, according to reports in the Ashi Shimbun and the Nikkei Business Daily.

The bar is part of a growing trend of small drinking establishments that appear to be mimicking 'speakeasy' from the days of Prohibition. These small bars typically rely on word-of-mouth advertising and are generally located in lane ways with little signage. 

Even though it wasn't named in reports, the Japanese bar asked the Tabelog website to pull down a review and photos of the establishment.

However the foodie website is refusing to do so, arguing it has the right to publish under freedom of expression laws.

Instead of taking the traditional approach to marketing, the bar prefers to be a point of difference by remaining little-known and difficult to find.

'Our stagecraft as a secret hideaway was designed to appeal to visitors' imaginations,' the bar operators told the Osaka District Court, according to the Asahi.

The Tabelog information â€œtook away the elements of surprise and fun and undermined our operational strategyâ€
