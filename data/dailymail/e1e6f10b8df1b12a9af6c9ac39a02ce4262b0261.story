Three people have been arrested after six revellers were stabbed when a drunken brawl broke out at a New Year's Eve masquerade party at the Belfry golf club.

Police were called to the Bel Air Nightclub in the grounds of the upmarket Warwickshire resort at 12.50am today after a 21-year-old man was knifed in the chest.

Officers arrested a 26-year-old man on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm but further violence then broke out.

Police have arrested three men in connection with the violent incidents who are all from Birmingham 

Another five victims suffered stab wounds - with a 28-year-old man remaining in a critical condition while four others aged between 20 and 27 have been released from hospital.

The initial 21-year-old victim underwent surgery and is not believe to be in a critical condition.

As well as the 26-year-old man, police arrested a 22-year-old on suspicion of assault while a 20-year-old was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder.

The trio, all from nearby Birmingham, remain in police custody  and are being quizzed by detectives.

Superintendent Adrian McGee, of Warwickshire Police, said: 'This is the early stages of the investigation and at this time officers are still in the process of piecing together what has happened.

'This was a very challenging disorder for our officers to control on what was a very busy night for the force, and I am grateful for the work they conducted and bravery they showed last night in bringing order to this incident.

'Enquiries are being completed to identify the individuals who are responsible for the varied assaults.

'The management at the Belfry are assisting in bringing an understanding to the events of last night.

'We would urge anyone who was inside, or in the vicinity of, the nightclub during the time of these incidents who has information to assist the inquiry to contact police on 101, quoting incident number 24 of January 1st, 2015.'

The Bel Air Nightclub has undergone a £1.2 million refurbishment and was holding a Masquerade-style ball

Taking to Twitter, one eyewitness said: 'It turned into some mad movie scene at the Belfry last night, what on earth was happening.'

Another reveller added: 'Asif there was 6 stabbings up the belfry last night, I seen it all kicking off but didn't think it was that bad.'

And @iampennell-app said: 'Felt like I was in the Bronx last night rather than The Belfry.. Nothing like a mob of Police and Ambulances to see in the New Year eh.'

Bosses at the five-star Belfry said the golf resort, in Wishaw, Warks., remained open for business as usual on New Year's Day.

But customers were unable to access the site through the main gates on Lichfield Road and a car park nearby remained sealed off with police tape yesterday (Thur).

David Edwards, general manager at the hotel said: 'It is business as usual at the Belfry, we had a very successful New Year's Eve at the hotel.

'There was an incident, police have been on the site this morning and we are co-operating with their enquiries.'

The 'Nude Years Eve' party at the Bel Air Nightclub - which has recently had a £1.2million refurbishment - was advertised on the Belfry website as a ticket-only event.

The dress code for the party was 'Masquerade - smart attire' and the club, which is a separate venue in the hotel grounds, only allows entry to over-20s.

The event, described as a 'Nude Years Eve Masquerade Ball' was sold out
