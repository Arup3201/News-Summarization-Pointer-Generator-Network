A New Zealand couple whose triplets died in a Qatar mall fire two years ago have celebrated the christening of their twins.

Martin and Jane Weekes held the christening of Parker and Poppy Weekes, who will turn one next month, on Saturday.

The celebration came three days after the May 28 anniversary of the deaths of their three-year-old triplets Lillie, Willsher and Jackson, who were killed in a fire while at a nursery in the Villaggio Mall in Qatar.

Mr Weekes said Parker and Poppy were healthy but the lead up to the christening had been difficult as he and his wife remembered the anniversary of the deaths of their older children.

'There's never a day when we don't think about Lillie, Jackson and Willsher. For a lot of the time it's manageable but then something will creep up on you and I found last week very difficult because it's the one day of their life that we don't want to commemorate,' he told the New Zealand Herald.

'It's a day we would rather forget. We would rather remember their second birthday parties or when we were travelling but we can't until the court case is finished.'

The triplets were killed when a fire broke out at the Gympanzee nursery in the mall.

Thirteen children, four staff and two firefighters were killed in the fire, which was found to be the result of an electrical fault at the Nike store.

The chairman of the mall, a mall manager and an official from Qatar's ministry of trade and business have all been sentenced to prison over the fire, but have not spent any time in jail because they are appealing the sentences.

The court case has been drawn out, with Mr Weekes saying they were up to the ninth hearing of the case.

'The lawyers on the other side are doing all they can to drag it out and delay it. The last time we had a hearing the applicants' lawyer requested an adjournment for two months so he could go on holiday - and he got it. This time he's decided he wants to call someone elseâ€¦ it is dragging it out so they get to the summer of Ramadan and nothing will happen,' he told the New Zealand Herald.
