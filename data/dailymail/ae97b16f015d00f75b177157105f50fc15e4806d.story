After the biggest fight in boxing was finally confirmed, Manny Pacquiao wasted no time in landing the first punch in the war of words.

With the Filipino fighter now set to fight Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2, Pacquiao took to Instagram to claim the delay to the eagerly anticipated bout came from the American. 

Pacquiao has insisted that he agreed to the fight long before the deal was announced, and was merely waiting for Mayweather to confirm it.

And he posted a picture of the contract, signed by his team and awaiting his opponent's signature, to prove his case.

'Finally he sign the contract so the fight is on,' wrote Pacquiao on his Instagram. 'This is what I'm talking about that I sign already before, im just explaining to the fans and to prove that im not lying, i have the fear of the Lord. 

'So this is it! The fight is on fans you deserve it thank you. To God be all the Glory.'

The picture appears to show the same contract that Mayweather posted on Friday night to announce the fight. 

But 'Money Man' hit back at his opponent, claiming that he didn't delay, and signed the contract as soon as it was shown to him.

'Everyone was saying, "Sign the contract! Sign the contract!"', Mayweather told Fight Hype. 

'As soon as [Pacquiao's promoter] Bob Arum signed and as soon as Manny signed, Al Haymon brought the contract right to me and I signed the contract with no problem at all.' 

'I'm not here to say anything negative about Bob or say anything negative about Manny. That's not my job to do. 

'I'm a boxer/entertainer and my job is to go out there and entertain and be the best that I can be. I'm just happy that we were able to make the fight happen. I can't wait.
