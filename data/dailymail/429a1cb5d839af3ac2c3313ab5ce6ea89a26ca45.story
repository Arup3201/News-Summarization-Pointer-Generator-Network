A little girl born to one of three women as she was imprisoned in a Cleveland home for a decade is 'happy and healthy' despite being brought up in captivity, authorities have revealed.

After kidnap victim Amanda Berry, 27, courageously escaped the home on Monday, she told her grandmother that the child is her daughter Jocelyn, who was born on Christmas six years ago.

Authorities believe that Jocelyn's father is one of the three brothers arrested in connection with the kidnappings and they are now carrying out paternity tests to confirm their suspicions.

The six-year-old girl was home-schooled by her mother, possibly without the knowledge of the suspects, Ariel Castro, 52, and 
his 
two brothers Onil Castro, 50, and Pedro Castro, 54.

Jocelyn, who escaped the home with Amanda and two other missing women, Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michelle Knight, 32, was pictured grinning in hospital alongside her mother and her aunt Beth.

The little girl, who authorities said
 enjoyed popsicles while being examined by doctors, is photographed 
lying in a hospital bed and showing off her missing two front 
teeth.

'She looks great, happy, healthy and 
ate a popsicle last night,' Cleveland Police Deputy Chief Ed Tomba said. 'Seeing her mother smile made her smile.'

He added that it was 'a good possibility' that one of the three suspects was her father.

Police are now trying to determine what life was like for the little girl inside the house of horrors. They do not have a record of her birth and are trying to establish if she was born in the fortified home.

Police sources said Jocelyn was occasionally taken out of the house and would visit Ariel Castro's mother, Lillian Rodriguez, who she called 'grandmother'.

Rodriguez was pictured returning from police questioning on Tuesday, but it is not known if she knew of the sick crimes allegedly carried out by her sons.

She was also seen out recently at a 
playground with Castro. When he was asked who the young girl was he told
 neighbors she was his girlfriend's daughter.

It is feared other babies were born inside the Cleveland house. At least five children may have born at the house, police sources told NewsChannel5.

One victim suffered up to three miscarriages because she was so malnourished, while other sources told WKYC the 
captors would beat the pregnant women, so that the 
babies would not survive.

It is unknown what happened to any children who were born at the home.

FBI Special Agent Vicki Anderson told
 ABC TV that the three woman had spent time together at Metro Medical 
Center hospital, where they were taken after being freed.

Missing: Michelle Knight, now 32, was also found inside the home, nearly 11 years after she went missing

She described them as being in very good spirits and said it was obvious that they were very close.

'You could see that they had a bond, that they had been through this together,’ she said.

All three women were abducted between
 2002 and 2004, Berry and DeJesus were in their teens at the time of 
their kidnappings and Knight was 20 years old.

On Monday evening, Berry began 
screaming from behind the locked front door of the home and was helped out by a neighbor. She fled the home and called 911.

Authorities are now investigating how the horrors inside the home went undetected for so long.

Neighbour Israel Lugo said other 
neighbors had seen naked women crawling on all fours behind Castro's 
house. Three men were in the garden and were controlling the women, he 
said.

'We thought it was funny at first, and then we thought that was weird so we called the cops,' neighbor Nina Samoylicz told CNN. 'They thought we was playing, joking, they didn't believe us.'

Neighbors waited for police for two hours but no patrol cars showed up.

Cleveland police said that the department has no records of a call for service to that home.

But the claim is one of a 
number of stories to have emerged from neighbors who say they reported 
unusual goings-on at Castro's Seymour Avenue, Cleveland home to local 
police who either didn't respond or didn't enter the house when they did
 show up.

Lugo said he also called police after
 his sister saw a woman and a baby standing in a window at the home 
which was half covered by a plank.

Lugo also said his mother was puzzled when Castro would park outside the
 home in his yellow school bus. He would go inside clutching bags of 
McDonalds and sodas.

It has emerged that Ariel Castro 
would allegedly use a sick game to 'train' the three girls not to run 
away by pretending to leave the house, only to beat them if they tried 
to run free.

It is said to be just one of the 
manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house 
for up to ten years, in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging
 from the ceiling.

But on Tuesday, Cleveland Police said: 
'Every single lead was followed up on no matter how small. We dug up 
yards, canvassed neighborhoods. [The] real hero is Amanda Berry.'

Until now the search for the missing 
women had been fruitless, a series of false leads and bitter 
disappointment for the desperate families.

Michelle Knight, who was 20 years old
 when she went missing in August 2002, was last seen at a cousin's house
 near West 106th Street and Lorain Avenue.

Three years later, in April 2003, 
Amanda Berry, disappeared after leaving her job at a Burger King - at 
West 110th Street and Lorain. It was the day before her 17th birthday.

And a year later, Gina DeJesus, then 14 years old, was last seen leaving her middle school at West 105th Street and Lorain.

All three were found safe on Monday 
night after Berry bolted from a home on Seymour Avenue, about three 
miles from where they were last seen.

She told police that she and the 
other girls were being held prisoner by Ariel Castro, 52, who has been 
arrested along with his two brothers on suspicion of kidnapping.

The Berry family has expressed their joy at having Amanda home.

'I didn’t know what to say. Best thing that ever happened to me. Best feeling I’ve ever had,' Amanda’s dad Johnny Berry told Newsnet5.

Her grandmother, Fern Gentry, spoke to Amanda on the phone from her home in Elizabethton, Tennessee.

'I'm glad to have you back,' Gentry told her, with Amanda responding: 'I'm glad to be back.'

But
 the discovery is also laced in sadness as Amanda's mother, Louwana 
Miller, who relentlessly searched for her missing daughter, passed away 
in 2006 without knowing she was still alive.

The exact circumstances of the 
abductions is currently unclear, and it is not known whether or not the 
kidnapper deliberately targeted the block where all three victims were 
taken.

The Castro brothers are awaiting their arraignment on Wednesday morning, as authorities told ABC News that they plan to start questioning the men today.

A judge gave police extra time to file charges against the brothers, extending the charging period from 36 hours to 48 hours.
