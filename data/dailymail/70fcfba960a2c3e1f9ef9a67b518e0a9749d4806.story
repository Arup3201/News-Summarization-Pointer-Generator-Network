Footballer Phil Neville has put his luxury apartment up for rent for £15,000 a month.

The former Everton and Manchester United star is looking for a tenant for his home in Beetham Tower in Manchester - but it will set back the new occupant an eye-watering £180,000 a year.

Thought to be one of the city’s most expensive rental properties ever, the 45th-floor apartment boasts four bedrooms and stunning near 360 degree views from its floor-to-ceiling windows.

Looking for interest: The estate agents said they have had 'quite a few enquiries about this property since we put it up for rent but have yet to find a tenant'

Neville, 36, a former England defender who retired from football after leaving Everton at the end of the season, lived there with his wife Julie, 37, and their children Harvey, 11, and Isabella, nine.

The property has been on the market to sell since 2010, when it had an asking price of £4million before being reduced by £250,000 - but it remains for sale at £3.75million.

The couple hope to find a tenant while searching for a permanent owner for the three-storey luxury home, which was designed by Kelly Hoppen and features a black and white colour scheme.

Named The Orchid Suite, the home is described as ‘5,000 sq ft of pure luxury’ by the estate agents - and even comes with five parking spaces.

It also includes a chandelier hanging

limestone flooring, ‘intelligent’ lighting schemes and a shower which 
doubles as a steam room.

The apartment also has his-and-hers 
dressing rooms and chutes which connect each bedroom’s laundry baskets 
to the utility room below.

It has already had one star occupant - music mogul Simon Cowell, 53, who rented it while filming Britain’s Got Talent in Manchester.

'This is definitely the most expensive apartment we have ever marketed - it’s like a mansion in the sky'

Jennie Platt, City Centre Chic

Founder and managing director Jennie Platt said: ‘This is definitely the most expensive apartment we have ever marketed - it’s like a mansion in the sky.

‘This is in a prime location and on another level of luxury. We have had quite a few enquiries about this property since we put it up for rent but have yet to find a tenant.

‘Because of the transfer window, this is one of the busiest times of year for us in terms of new players, managers and football executives coming to Manchester.’
