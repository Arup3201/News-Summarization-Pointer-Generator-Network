Nick Clegg last night condemned the ‘frankly absurd’ idea of it being only mothers who stay at home to look after children, as he vowed to make it easier for new father’s to take time off.

The Lib Dem leader, bruised by a raft of allegations that his party ignored complaints of sexual harassment by Lord Rennard, sought to present himself as a champion of women’s rights.

In a speech to open the Lib Dem spring conference in Brighton, he attacked the culture of ‘old boy’s clubs’ and said that women still face ‘glass ceilings everywhere they look’.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, pictured arriving in Brighton, told delegates at the party's spring conference that serious failings had been made in the handling of harassment claims

Arriving in Brighton, Mr Clegg denied his party was in crisis, insisting: 'We're in good spirits.'

But his optimism contrasted with a warning from the party's president Tim Farron that the the Lib Dems are in a 'critical state'.

Mr Farron also branded the party a 'bunch of nutters' and 'cockroaches' and warned: 'One day someone will stand on us if we are not careful.

Business Secretary Vince Cable is also preparing to use the conference to repeat his call this week for the government to consider increasing borrowing to spend on infrastructure.

In his speech to a party rally last night, Mr Clegg boasted that changes to parental leave – allowing new mothers and fathers to share up to a year in time off work – would create a ‘level playing field’ between men and women.

But he admitted that his party’s reputation has been rocked by groping allegations against former Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard.

He told activists in Brighton that the party had to take ‘a long, hard look in the mirror’ and realise it had ‘let people down’.

But he admitted that the Lib Dems had ‘no excuse for failing to live up to the highest standards in the treatment of women’.

At least 10 women had made allegations against former chief executive Lord Rennard, which he strenuously denies.

Mr Clegg said he would not comment on the specific claims which are being investigated by two party inquires and the police.

But he told delegates: ‘It is right that – following the events of recent weeks – we take a long, hard look in the mirror.’

In the speech, to mark International Women’s Day, he said the women involved ‘feel let down’. ‘They deserved to have their concerns and allegations examined thoroughly and properly dealt with. But clearly, that has not always been the case.

‘For a party that cherishes equality and women’s rights, we have no excuse for failing to live up to the highest standards in the treatment of women. The standards we – rightly – expect of others.

‘I joined this party because I believe in empowerment; freedom; dignity. I believe that, where an individual feels that they have been badly treated, or that power has been abused, they must have confidence that those concerns will be properly addressed.’

Mr Clegg said he was ‘proud’ of the work the Lib Dems had done in government to ‘level the playing field’ thought shared parental leave and flexible working.

Liberal Democrats today appointed a prominent female City figure to lead the independent inquiry into the party's culture and handling of complaints, launched in the wake of the allegations against Lord Rennard.

Helena Morrissey's review will look at attitudes towards women in the party, as well as the employment relationship between staff, elected officials and volunteers, training, and how to lead a wider change in Westminster.

Ms Morrissey, the chief executive of Newton Investment Management, is the founder of the Thirty Per Cent Club, which campaigns to increase the proportion of women in company boardrooms.

She said today that those at the top of politics should 'lead by example' in tackling the old boys' networks which still exclude women from many parts of society.

The Morrissey review is separate from a disciplinary inquiry into allegations by a number of women of sexual harassment against Lord Rennard, which the Lib Dem peer strenuously denies.

Under the plans New mums and dads will
 be able to ‘mix and match’ how they look after a newborn baby for their
 first year. They will be able to take up a total of 52 weeks in joint 
leave, either taking it in turns or at the same time.

But
 it risks creating an organisational nightmare for employers, who will 
not be able to refuse requests to take off but can turn block the 
pattern of leave, if parents want to take time off in different chunks.

Mr Clegg said too often new parents base decisions about which parents stays at home on money.

‘It’s an equation where the answer is so often rigged because, whichever way you look at it, the solution ends up being the mother doing more of the caring, and the father doing more of the earning – even if that isn’t what the young couple wants.

‘She gets the year-long maternity leave; after that, the expectation is she’ll continue to be the primary carer – so she’s the one who goes part-time. Lower pay, fewer shots at promotion. Work less, earn less.

‘It’s heartbreaking to watch women who
 feel forced to lower their ambitions for themselves. And it’s 
heartbreaking to see fathers missing out on being with their children.

‘As
 a father, I find the outdated assumption that men should go out and 
work and women should stay at home and look after the children frankly 
absurd.’

Mr Clegg also criticised his own party’s failure to elect more women, after some of the allegations against Lord Rennard centred on his role in choosing female candidates for safe seats.

He attacked Westminster as an ‘old boy’s club’, complaining that both the Commons and the Lords are ‘stuffed full of hundreds and hundreds of men and precious few women’.

‘Too often, barriers are put in front of talented and committed women to stop them progressing. It’s a male world, made by men for men, occupied for centuries by men and designed to work to the advantage of men.

‘And Westminster is far from the only boy’s club in our country.’

He criticised the legal system, business and the media for being too male dominated.

Mr Cable has questioned whether whether the Government should ¿borrow more, at very low interest rates, in order to finance more capital spending

Senior Lib Dems will use the spring conference to distance themselves from the Tory party.

Nick Clegg is expected to use his keynote speech to target both Conservatives and Labour, in an attempt to bolster support for his party after slumping in the polls.

Business Secretary Vince Cable will also step up his calls for borrowing to be increased to fund infrastructure spending, despite being slapped down by David Cameron yesterday.

The Prime Minister insisted there s no 'magic money tree' to fund big money projects.

But Mr Cable will again say capital spending, funded by borrowing, may be needed to kick-start growth.

He will repeat his call, in the New Statesman magazine this week, that the Government’s decision to stick to Labour’s plan to cut capital spending was a mistake which had ‘economic consequences’.

Mr Cable said there was now a legitimate debate about whether the Government should ‘borrow more, at very low interest rates, in order to finance more capital spending - building of schools and colleges, small road and rail projects, more prudential borrowing by councils for house building.’

He told the magazine that the strategy ‘does not undermine the central objective of reducing the structural deficit, and may assist it by reviving growth’.
