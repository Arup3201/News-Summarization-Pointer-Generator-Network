When young British models Cara Delevingne and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley stepped out at Paris Fashion Week wearing V-neck tops slashed to their waists this week, onlookers might have expected an abundance of breast on show.

After all, the new trend for deep-plunge necklines leaves little to the imagination. But there was, in fact, barely any cleavage to be seen — despite the minimal material.

For this slick new style, spearheaded by the slimmest of celebrities, is actually all about having no cleavage.

It is, indeed, the ‘no-cleavage cleavage’: a daring display of chest that demonstrates not acres of soft, ample bosom but a hard, toned torso without a whiff of wobble.

Rosie Huntington-Whiteley: It's hard to upstage a strip sequin jumpsuit, bur Rosie's gravity-defying body puts this Balmain creation in the shadows. But then, this plunge is designed to do one thing: show off a taut, perfect torso.

Gwyneth Paltrow: Gwyneth manages a laid-back take on the tux by pairing relaxed trousers with her plunging neckline. The result is effortlessly chic, though the chunky gold chain emphasises her jutting collarbone. 

 

Abbey Clancy: Grown-up rather than gimmicky, she channels the no-cleavage cleavage look in a classic white suit. Perhaps it is the fear of flashing, or lavish amounts of sticky tape under the jacket, which leaves her looking uncomfortable.

Cara Delevingne: Dramatically plunging is an understatement — this top is smaller than most swimming costumes. Coupled with stripy, see-through trousers and a waist-squeezing belt, her Balmain jumpsuit screams ‘look at my chest!’

 

Kate Hudson: Kate's beautifully draped frock is a red carpet winner, complete with regal train and shimmering fabric, but it’s the plunge neck that steals the show, and the toned skin and body it reveals.

Georgia May Jagger: Proof that no-cleavage cleavage can be classy. Georgia’s sophisticated Thierry Mugler dress flashes large amounts of flesh but strikes a balance between chic and sexy.

 

Sienna Miller: Sienna's low-cut lace dress with waterfall hem needs only one accessory — a golden tan. Oh, and perfectly toned, svelte side order of toupee tape to keep it all in place. 

Reese Witherspoon: Reese's trademark prom dress gets a modern makeover with this slashed-to-the-navel version. It’s further highlighted by a split-patterned long skirt which ensures the right flash of flesh is on show - her chest.

 

Miranda Kerr: The Australian model is more shapely than many — but this outfit is calculated to play down her curves. Seen at this week’s Louis Vuitton show, her only accessory is the gold chain of her Vuitton bag.  

Kate Moss: An original member of the ‘flat pack’, supermodel Kate has long shown bigger isn't always better — and by pairing this super-low neckline with batwing sleeves, her kaftan-inspired dress is respectable rather than racy.

 

Cheryl Fernandez-Versini: Cheryl plunging neckline shows that even with more womanly curves, you can still nail the no-cleavage cleavage look. Bold, blue and brave — Cheryl goes all-out with this daring jumpsuit carefully tailored to highlight her upper body.

Suki Waterhouse: This plunging neckline highlights not just a toned chest but also more of her pale, interesting look. Where most V-neck dresses are designed to highlight a cleavage, this version, worn with no bra, does the opposite.

 

Minnie Driver: Minnie's scooped neckline shows off not her cleavage — cleverly supported as it appears — but her collarbone and swathes of soft, supple skin. The figure- hugging, long dress only further highlights the effective look.

Stella Tennant: Masculine tailoring and muted colours would make British model and Queen of Androgyny Stella Tennant’s outfit a masterclass in understatement if her shirt wasn't worn quite so open to reveal acres of bare flesh.

A curvy chest has long been a sought-after asset — driving women to try everything from push-up bras and gel pads to breast-boosting surgery, with designers delighting in showing off a generous bosom with corset tops and scoop necklines.

But it’s naturally associated with a more curvaceous figure — and if there’s one thing today’s celebrities don’t want, it’s to be anything other than pin thin.

So far from being shy about showing off a flat-chest, bony Gwyneth Paltrow deliberately opts for a daringly low V-neck black trouser suit, while of-the-moment supermodel Suki Waterhouse makes the most of her total absence of cleavage in a deep-cut black dress.

Cara and Rosie’s bold jumpsuits go one step further, with nothing but narrow, bandage-like straps that would struggle to hold in most women’s modesty and a skin-tight halterneck style that actively flattens what little bosom they have.

After decades of women enhancing their cleavage, these clothes go flat out to obliterate any hint of a curve. Never mind that such an androgynous chest would look more normal on a teenage boy than an average adult woman (typical size, a voluptuous 36C and rising) — what better way for stars to flaunt their taut, trim body than by showing off a bare, flat front?

The style also demonstrates their enviable ability to go bra-less; if most ladies’ breasts might sag and escape without support, these stars show not so much as a crease.

The subtext is clear: not for them the oh-so-common battle to contain troublesome lumps and bumps, their bodies are so neat and pert they require no assistance at all.

Except, of course, that such a style is not quite as carefree as it looks; hidden under these well-positioned outfits will be plenty of carefully placed tape to keep the fabric attached to the skin, as well as secret modifications, from nipple stickers to strapless cups to ensure a smooth, safe appearance.

Here we look at how the stars are turning to dramatically low-cut attire to show off their no-cleavage cleavage . . .
