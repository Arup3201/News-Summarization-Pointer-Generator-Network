A birdwatcher feared he was going to be beheaded by a scythe-wielding 'lunatic' after being mistaken for a prowler.

Scott Cullen, 22, had set up his camera to photograph woodpeckers in the Welsh countryside when he was confronted by angry local Leslie Bickley.

Bickley, 63, accused him of being a prowler and pulled out the garden scythe from under his coat.

A jury heard Bickley then made Mr Cullen kneel like in a 'terrorist execution'.

Mr Cullen told the court: 'He said he’d sharpened the blade and told me to feel how sharp it was.

'He said he was going to cut off my limbs one by one.

'I just curled up into a ball on the floor - he was holding the blade to me as if he was going to go for me.

'He swung it past my ears. I could feel the wind, that’s how I know it was close.'

Postman Mr Cullen was headbutted by Bickley but he managed to run into a nearby river to escape. 

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Mr Cullen was an 'innocent and well-mannered young man' who enjoyed birdwatching and wildlife photography.

He was sitting on his rucksack, dressed in camouflage trousers and jacket when Bickley attacked him.

Prosecutor Ieuan Morris said: 'Bickley 
frightened the life out of a young man who was doing nothing more than 
taking photographs.

'He produced a hand scythe, commanding Mr Cullen to get on his knees and threatening to chop off his limbs.

'He obeyed his command and went down on his knees as if facing execution. He was behaving like a lunatic.'

The court heard retired builder Bickley, who has previous convictions for violence, lived close to the woods where Mr Cullen was birdwatching.

'He said he'd sharpened the blade and told me to feel how sharp it was.'

Eugene Egan, defending, said: 'He had been beset by a problems from unknown people and thought Mr Cullen was a prowler.

'He was a man who had reached the end of his tether, snapped and lost the self control he should have exercised.

'His patience had simply run out. He overstepped the mark.'

Bickley, of Merthyr Tydfil, was jailed for 12 months after being found guilty of causing actual bodily harm and having an offensive weapon in a public place.

Judge Richard Twomlow told him: 'This was an extremely unpleasant incident. You make Mr Cullen kneel down in a terrorist execution style.'

Bickley was found guilty at Merthyr Tydfil Law Courts and sentenced to 12 months in prison
