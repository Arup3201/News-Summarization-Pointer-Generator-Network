Maria Lauretta leaving her home in Essex. Originally from Italy, she is one of a new breed of landlords who move paying tenants into unclaimed properties

After pensioner Michael Rees died last year, leaving no surviving relatives, his neighbours wondered what would become of his house.

They kept an eye on the £275,000 home and tended the front and rear gardens to make sure the property looked occupied.

Then, after the terrace house had been empty for 13 months, an ‘Heir Hunter’ arrived on the scene and claimed it.

But Maria Lauretta was not even a distant relative of the late owner. Instead she was an opportunist who changed the locks and announced she would be putting tenants into the property.

The brazen Miss Lauretta even stuck a notice in the front window proclaiming: ‘Private Property – Keep Out’.

Astonishingly, police deemed that she had not committed any crime, but the Treasury Solicitor’s department, which is responsible for the empty property, changed the locks again to keep Miss Lauretta out.

The house, according to her own boasts, is not the first property she has appropriated.

She represents a new trend in property developers, who scour government websites to locate the houses of those who have died without leaving a will.

College lecturer Mr Rees, an only child, lived with his parents in the house in Bede Road, Chadwell Heath, Essex.

His father Ernest died at the age of 76 in 1988 and his mother Gwendoline, 84, followed in 1999.

Mr Rees, who was unmarried, stayed in the house until his death in April 2012, when he was 72.

The homes of those who die intestate, like Mr Rees, pass into the hands of the Treasury Solicitor’s department.

Known as ‘bona vacantia’ – Latin for ‘ownerless property’ – they are advertised on the department’s website, which is updated weekly, making it easy for squatters to find them and move in. If no one claims them they revert to state ownership and are sold.

Last year the Government earned £12million from unclaimed estates.

Two months ago, Miss Lauretta descended on Bede Road, where she asked a 14-year-old girl if the house was unoccupied.

The following evening she returned with a locksmith who changed the front door locks.

Neighbours asked under whose authority she was acting after she apparently told the locksmith that she was a ‘solicitor’. She gave them a sheet of paper which quoted snippets from the Treasury Solicitor’s website about ‘bona vacantia’ properties.

She wrote on the paper: ‘I would rather see an empty house brought back into productive use than left to rot without even any insurance.’ She said she would soon be moving paying tenants into the house, with rents being paid to her.

Miss Lauretta told neighbours that she had ‘lots of other bona vacantia’ properties and one said: ‘She was so brazen. We asked her if she was a relative and all she would say was, “No, but I am legal. I am doing you a huge favour by putting tenants into the house”.’

After she left the shocked neighbours contacted their MP, Michael Gapes, and the Treasury Solicitor’s department.

Mr Gapes, Labour member for Ilford South, got in touch with police, and the Treasury Solicitor’s department employed another locksmith to change the new locks.

Miss Lauretta, who runs three companies – Pridwen Properties Limited, Nander House Limited and Morgelay Limited – lives in Shoeburyness, near Southend-on-Sea, Essex.

When approached by the Daily Mail she said: ‘I am not prepared to discuss anything with you. What I do is my business.’

Solicitor Richard Grosberg, former chairman of the Law Society’s Probate section, said: ‘Whatever this lady says it appears that she tried to steal a house rather like someone might try and steal a car.

‘While trespass is a civil matter I would have thought by breaking and entering into this property she has broken the criminal law. Impersonating a solicitor is also a criminal matter.’

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘Officers assessed the information available and no criminal offence was apparent.’

A spokesman for the Treasury Solicitor said: ‘The property was very quickly secured and it was made clear to the person who attempted to take possession of it  what the consequences of their actions could be.

‘Therefore, no formal civil or criminal action needed to be taken, but this will not always be the case.’

The popular BBC TV show Heir Hunters follows probate researchers trying to track down people who may be entitled to inherit estates. Around 30million people in the UK – half the population – have not made a will.
