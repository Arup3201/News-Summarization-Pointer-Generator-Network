The juggernaut computer system that pays out more than $100 billion a year in welfare to people across Australia is on the brink of collapse according to Tony Abbott's Human Services Minister. 

Centrelink's archaic Income Security Integrated System (ISIS), which was set up in 1983, is reportedly unable to cope with demand and the government is finding it increasingly difficult to hire people who know how to use the outdated software.

Human Services Minister Marise Payne told Daily Mail Australia: 'Very few organisations around the world still use this type of computer system and that makes finding and attracting skilled staff difficult.'

'To deal with the increased demands over the years the original system has literally had another 350 systems bolted on. To put it simply, we are running a turbo-charged Commodore 64 with a spoiler in the age of the iPhone,' Ms Payne explained.  

When it was first launched the database management system only handled $10 billion worth of payments to around 2.5 million people.

It is now buckling under the pressure of serving out cash to 7.3 million citizens.

Human Services minister Marise Payne, seen here in 2013, has described the department's IT system as a 'Commodore 64'

'The government is currently considering whether to replace the current welfare payments IT system,' Ms Payne said.

'Despite its age and extraordinary complexity, the Department's payment system is very reliable and has an extremely high level of payment accuracy.'

The minister said one of the issues with the current system is that it creates additional work for staff and customers.

'For example, the current system is built around individual payments and not the person, or their family. This means every time a customer starts a new claim they are treated as a new customer and have to provide some or all of their details again, which causes understandable frustration,' Ms Payne explained.

'The department has a highly skilled and committed team of ICT experts working in this area, some of who have worked on the system for more than two decades. The government now faces a significant challenge to retain this level of knowledge into the future let alone attract new IT staff.' 

The Model 204 database management system, designed by the Computer Corporation of America, is also used by the Pentagon, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense. 

The Centrelink IT database was built in 1983 and is in urgent need of an overhaul according to Treasurer Joe Hockey (right)

Ms Payne is not the first government member to call for an overhaul of the 30-year-old system.

In April 2014, Treasurer Joe Hockey told radio show 3AW that upgrading the IT infrastructure was essential.

'We have to do it. The question is how we will do it and how we will ensure that we improve service delivery into the future,' Mr Hockey said.

He described the system as 'ageing' and 'in bad shape' and said it is 'inhibiting the capacity of the government, to some degree, to roll out policy that properly addresses problems in the economy and in the budget'.

Marise Payne, seen here in the Centrelink Cabramatta Service Centre, believes the IT system needs an upgrade

And in 2013, Human Services Chief Information Officer Gary Sterrenberg described the ISIS system as 'a soldier'.

He told the website IT News: 'The ISIS system has been a trusted servant of our social welfare program… a lot of people call it legacy… I prefer to call it heritage.'

Talking about his dreams of an upgrade he said: 'I will be looking at whatever solution can service the business needs that we have.'

Mr Sterrenberg has Human Services Minister Marise Payne on board after he was granted a $16.2 million budget to put forward a business case for a replacement or upgrade of the major Centrelink IT system.

The cost was met from within the existing resources of the department.

The government is finding it increasingly difficult to hire people who know how to use the Centrelink IT software

A statement from the department in 2013 said: 'An upgraded system will have increased capacity to support the current and changing needs of Australians and enable the department to continue to support and deliver Government programs efficiently and effectively.

'This will enable us to build on the work we are already doing to give customers a greater degree of convenience, simplicity and security through improved access to online and self-service options. No customer payments will be affected by this measure and customers do not have to do anything to benefit.'
