Most of us try (loosely) to drop a few winter pounds before we head to the beach on our summer holiday, in vague effort to look a little less wobbly in a bikini.

But once we're propped on a sun lounge and offered an ice cream the diet goes whizzing out the window, and we're all wolfing down second helpings of tatziki, noodles and paella before you can say 'Is today my five day or my two day?'. And it shows.

Almost 80 per cent of us will gain weight during our annual break, returning home with an average 8ln of 'excess baggage', according to studies. And it takes us a month of strict dieting to lose it once we're back at work.

Most people kick the diet when they go on holiday and just eat whatever they want, returning 8lbs heavier and spending a month trying to shift the excess baggage

America is the worst place for holiday 
waistlines, with visitors gaining an average of 8lbs over two weeks 
thanks to the country's enormous portions and all-you-can-eat buffets

Only an extremely self-restrained four per cent of Brits say they pay attention to the nutritional content of the food they eat on holiday, and although 93 per cent of us attempt to eat local cuisine, barely any consider to check its nutritional value.

Nearly three quarters of travellers confess to tucking into holiday favourites such as rib eye steak, moussaka, pizza and Peking duck without a care. And 79 per cent of us gain weight as a result.

But rather than China or Italy, America is the worst place for holiday waistlines, with visitors gaining an average of 8lbs over two weeks thanks to the country's enormous portions and all-you-can-eat buffets, an amount that will take most people a month to lose.

Not far behind the USA, the neighbouring Caribbean is also one of the worst offenders, with its all-inclusive resorts securing second spot in a 'holiday fat map': those questioned gained on average 7.4lb on their trip.

France and Italy, with their wines, cheeses, creamy sauces and pasta are listed as the third and fourth, with Francophiles gaining 7.3lb while abroad and Italian food-lovers a round 7lb.

Despite most of us trying to drop some winter bulge before getting into the dreaded bikini, we tend to bin the diet as soon as we get to our holiday destination

The studies by Flora pro.activ and Obesimed blamed larger portions for putting on weight and the same number said it was down to 'lounging around'.

Tanya Footman, senior nutrition and health manager at Flora pro.activ told Waitrose Weekend magazine: 'It is amazing just how much hard work people put in to being healthy before they go away - and then once on holiday they don't give it a second thought.'

She added that there were some easy ways to avoid cholesterol-busting dishes abroad such as limiting deep-fried food and creamy sauces and asking for dressings, butter and sour cream on the side.

A separate study revealed that of the 42 per cent of people who said they dieted before a trip abroad, two thirds have piled the pounds back on by the end of the vacation.
