Reality TV star White Dee will be stripped of her benefits if she is found to be earning significant sums by cashing in on her notoriety, David Cameron implied yesterday.

The Prime Minister stepped in after the star of Channel 4’s Benefits Street insisted she would continue taking state handouts until he or his Government stopped her.

White Dee, whose real name is Deidre Kelly, has repeatedly insisted she is too ill to work as she suffers from depression.

The mother of two gets £214 a week from a combination of Employment and Support Allowance – formerly known as incapacity benefit – child tax credit and child benefit, plus £500 a month in housing benefit.

But controversy erupted at the weekend when it emerged Miss Kelly had been cashing in on her growing celebrity status, making a string of public appearances.

She was pictured partying during a promotional appearance in Magaluf, Majorca, and is said to have signed a deal to appear on the next Celebrity Big Brother.

Asked about her claims, Mr Cameron told the Daily Mail that it was not acceptable for someone to remain ‘parked on benefits’.

‘If people start earning money, we can take away their benefits money,’ he said. ‘If someone’s benefits aren’t appropriate they should be taken away.’

The Department for Work and Pensions said it could not comment on individual cases, but a Government source said it was ‘safe to assume’ Miss Kelly’s claims were now being examined.

People on Employment and Support Allowance can be allowed to take on small amounts of work, but employment involving significant earnings normally requires approval from a doctor who believes it will aid their recovery.

Miss Kelly, who was the star of Benefits Street, which showed the lives of families on James Turner Street in Birmingham, insists she is declaring all her earnings to the authorities.

‘If people have a problem with how much I am getting, they should speak to David Cameron,’ she said.

‘Yes, I am taking casual work. I won’t tell you how much I am earning but it’s not half as much as people think.’ Her last full-time job was at Birmingham council. She was fired in 2007 – and narrowly avoided a jail sentence – for stealing £13,000.

Following the popularity of the Channel 4 show, Miss Kelly has had several TV offers. She has done promotional work abroad, made a rap record and been DJing at nightclubs in Birmingham.

Her agent Barry Tomes dismissed suggestions the single mother should be stripped of her benefits.

Claiming he was trying to manage Miss Kelly’s ‘gradual’ return to work, he added: ‘I’m trying to get Dee fit for work. Once she does that, she will be able to earn good money and pay taxes on that.’
