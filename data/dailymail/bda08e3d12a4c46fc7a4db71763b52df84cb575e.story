The world's oldest working barmaid has died aged 100 after pulling more than two million pints during her 74-year career behind the bar.

Great-great grandmother Dolly Saville began her first job at a Buckinghamshire public house in 1940, when a pint cost just eight pence.

Over the last seven decades she has pulled  millions of pints and served many famous faces, including James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, former Prime Minister Ted Heath, footballer Stanley Matthews, singer Vera Lynn, ballet dancer Margot Fonteyn and actress Elizabeth Taylor.

Until six years ago, she was still working at least six hours a day, six days a week at The Red Lion Hotel in Wendover and has only ever had two weeks sick leave her entire life.

She had to reduce her shifts to three hours a week, but still spent time working on her feet clearing tables, serving customers and polishing glasses.  

At her 100th birthday party in April last year, she'd had no plans to stop working.

'They will have to carry me out from the Red Lion,' she said. 'I love the people, that's what keeps me going.

'I didn't think I would stay for such a long time but I've never thought about leaving.'

Sam Hughes, the pub's deputy manager, said at the time: 'She's full of energy and has a good sense of humour. She keeps us all in check half the time.

'It's a shame we don't have more people like her.'

The pensioner, who leaves behind three grandchildren, three great-grandchildren 
and one great-great granddaughter, even had the bar she works at 
named 'Dolly's' in her honour. 

Mrs Saville, whose two children are both retired, said last year: 'I love my work and I love the people, it keeps me going and it's better
 than sitting around.

'I
 never thought I would be here this long, but I've loved every minute of
 it. My family keeps asking if I want to stop, but I have no plans to 
retire.

'My boss is lovely and if he asked me to work an extra shift I would say yes as he has been so kind to me.' 

Born in Eton, Berkshire, Mrs Saville left school at 14 and went into service as a house maid. 

She married in her late teens and her daughter Anne was born soon after, followed by her son Roland.

When war broke out several years later, her husband joined the RAF and Dolly had to get a job to support the family. 

Despite the fact that both her children are both retired, Mrs Saville had not wanted to give up work at the Red Lion in Wendover

She
 had never done bar work before but was offered a job in the hotel by 
the landlord who spotted her walking past one day with her children.

She said: 'The
 landlord asked if I would like to work there, but I said no as I hadn't
 worked in a bar before and I never thought anymore about it.

'Then
 he saw me up the High Street and asked if I'd thought anymore about it.
 I said I hadn't but he said 'why don't you give it a try' so I said I 
would.

'I started just washing up glasses in the saloon bar. Then, 
after I'd been there about five or six weeks he said I think you could 
serve.

'I said 'Oh I don't think so, I'd give them the wrong change!' But I did, and I got on very well.'

When Mrs Saville first started the 16th Century hotel had three bars, a public bar, a saloon bar and a cocktail bar, and she would work in all three.

Her children, who were three and five at the time, would be left to play in the staff room or the beautiful hotel gardens.

She said: 'I worked in all three bars and over the years I've also cooked in the kitchen, done the bedrooms, the reception and the teas. I've done the lot.

'It has always been great fun and sometimes after a long shift I would be tired but we would go out dancing.'

'Even after the hotel, which has historical links with Oliver Cromwell and Robert Louis Stevenson, was closed five years ago for six months refurbishment Dolly refused to give up work.

Instead she went to the nearby King and Queen pub in Wendover, and continued working at the bars.

She said: 'I was so sad when they closed for six months.

'But I went to the King and Queen instead, they asked me if I would go there and I quite enjoyed that I must say!

Mrs Saville's granddaughter Kim Leemans said: 'We tried to get her to retire years ago but she said no, so we gave up the fight and let her carry on'

'I get very bored if I'm sitting too long. I must be doing something and working keeps my brain active. 

'I think that comes from when I left school at 14 and I went into private service. You had to work then, there was no nonsense, and if you didn't do it properly you did it again.'

The pensioner had just started working at the bar and was just 26.

King George VI was on the throne, Winston 
Churchill was Prime Minister and Britain was in the grip of World War 
Two.

The battle of France began, and the Dutch official surrendered to the German forces.

Paris was eventually bombed and invaded, while the French Resistance began their preliminary planning for guerrilla counter-attacks.

Later, the 'Battle of Britain' began, with the Nazi Luftwaffe consistently bombing London, and several parts of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, at strategic points, such as docks and aeronautical manufacturing plants.

This led to a period called the Blitz (a result of the British 'blackout') a pattern of strategic bombings by Nazi planes over populated areas.

The draft of around 16 million men began in the U.S, prior to their involvement in the war.

Also, Bugs Bunny made his debut in the Oscar-nominated cartoon short, A Wild Hare.

Mrs Saville, who became famous herself for being such a long-serving bar maid, also served many celebrities.

'I served Pierce Brosnan when he had lunch at the hotel while he was filming one of the Bond films,' she said previously.

'I also made tea and toast for Ted Heath when he came in on a chilly afternoon.

'Vera Lynn has also popped into the hotel several times for lunch. I think everyone in the village knows me now.'

Mrs Saville's daughter Anne Edwards, 79, from Wendover, said until she was 94 her mother would work a morning shift, come home for lunch, then go back again in the evening.

'When she started the job it was out of necessity, but I think it gradually became her life,' she added.

Mrs Saville's granddaughter Kim Leemans said the family had tried to get her to retire but she would hear none if it.

Robert Hynes, deputy manager, said last year: 'She is amazing and the customers absolutely love her. She has told me she doesn't want to leave until the day she dies.

'The younger members of staff aspire to be like her and think she'd brilliant. I think the job keeps her going and gives her something to look forward to.

'We get regulars who come in especially to see Dolly and in the run up to her birthday they've been travelling from further afield to see her.'

Hideko Arima, from Japan, was formerly the world's oldest bar maid.

She worked at her tiny bar, Gilbey Ai in Tokyo's Ginza district for 52 years until she was 101, and died in 2003.
