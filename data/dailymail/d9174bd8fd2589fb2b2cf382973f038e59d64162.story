How to be an MP: Paul Flynn's book (pictured) was the most borrowed book from the House of Commons library last year

An ‘idiot’s’ style-guide to how to be an MP was the most borrowed book from the House of Commons library last year.

According to official figures, MPs borrowed veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn’s humorous, self-help tome 19 times.

With nearly one in three MPs from the 2010 intake being new to the job, perhaps it was no surprise that politicians turned to How to be an MP, Learning the Commons Knowledge, for guidance.

Mr Flynn tells MPs how to advance their careers and climb the ‘greasy pole’, how to write an abusive letter to annoying constituents and how to convince voters that MPs never stop working.

He also tells those who are underwhelmed with the volume of work how to avoid getting bored.

The Newport West MP also gives tips on how to get a seat in the House of Lords once your Commons’ career is over.

In a guide to sex and booze in Westminster, Mr Flynn says flings are ‘inevitable’ and he writes of ‘furtive encounters in parliamentary offices when resistance levels are falling and testosterone levels are rising .  .  . serial seducers of both sexes roam the corridors’.  

The Commons’ elegant Pugin Room is ‘sinfully comfortable .  .  . popular for romantic encounters’.

By contrast, the MPs’ Smoking Room is a ‘melange of gentleman’s club and geriatric home, a refuge for alcohol addicts’. 

On expenses, he argues: ‘The manipulation of greed still seeks to corrupt the power of Parliament. The fumigation of the Palace cannot prevent its re-infestation.’

Mr Flynn is highly critical of ‘Gulliver’ MPs – ‘travel gluttons consoled by long hours in the sun at the poolside of a luxury hotel’.

Despite the official figures revealing how few politicians or their researchers borrow books, MPs managed to clock up nearly £2000 in unpaid library fines over the last five years.

Clueless MPs took out How Parliament Works 14 times. It was the second most popular book, slipping down one spot after five years at the top of the reading list.

Memoirs also featured on MPs’ reading lists. Those who wanted to impress borrowed the fourth volume of US President Lyndon Johnson’s biography.

This was borrowed from the library 11 times. Robert Caro’s work is often cited by those in Westminster’s inner circle.

Former Labour Cabinet Secretary, Peter Hain, also had his book Outside In borrowed 11 times while Tony Blair’s memoirs A Journey hit the top ten.

Themes around rich and poor were popular. Ferdinand Mount’s The new few, or a very British Oligarchy was the third most borrowed book.

Chavs, a study of class in Britain by socialist activist Owen Jones, was also read avidly by MPs.

MPs wanting to learn the lessons of foreign interventions also took Losing small wars: British military failure in Iraq and Afghanistan, by Frank Ledwidge.

Former Chancellor Alistair Darling’s Back from the brink, was the tenth most popular book.

Erskine May - the parliamentary ‘bible’ on legislative procedures and rules, was also taken out by MPs and staff.

There is little wonder that they turned to the Commons library to borrow a copy - new versions of the book sell for close to £300.
