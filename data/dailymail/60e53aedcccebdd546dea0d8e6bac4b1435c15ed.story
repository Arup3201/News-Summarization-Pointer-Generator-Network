These incredible images are not the swirls of paint on abstract artworks but a bird’s eye view of Iceland’s spectacular glacial rivers.

Photographed 500 feet above the central highlands and southern parts of Iceland, the dams and rivers take on amazingly sweeping shapes and colours as the water passes through glaciers and dams.

Russian photographer Andre Ermolaev travelled to Iceland to capture the unique beauty of its landscape.

The 57-year-old from Moscow said: ‘When we were in the plane we saw a river which had flown through several dams and the water is a transparent blue.

‘A bit upstream there is a little yellow stream that flows into this river and mixes with the water.

Almost art: The images look almost like art rather than the natural landscape of the island country

‘Patterns of nature are so amazing that nobody can say or describe what we see on the photograph - it's mind-blowing.

‘The photographs are a true reflection of what I saw on the day and I'm thrilled with the outcome.’

The shallow rivers spread quickly across flat and sandy surfaces after passing through glaciers, making the water cloudy. 

With tourism forming over 30 per cent of the island's income, visitors to the ice flows are treated to wonders such as the Jvkulsarlsn lagoon, dramatic ice walls and ominous icebergs.

Iceland is fast becoming the photography capital of the world - and with stunning results such as these, it's easy to see why.
