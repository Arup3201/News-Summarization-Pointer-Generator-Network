Expecting freezing cold water, perilous winds and crashing waves, he made meticulous preparations for a swim across the English Channel.

But there was one test that endurance athlete John van Wisse didn’t bargain on yesterday – running into the border authorities as he set out from Dover because locals feared he was an illegal immigrant.

As the Australian leapt into the water from a boat beneath the famous white cliffs, two eagle-eyed citizens spotted his bronzed features … and dialled 999. 

John Van Wisse, 41, was mistaken for an illegal immigrant while trying to beat 'Arch to Arc' triathlon record

Kent police arrived at Shakespeare beach in Dover this morning to look for the reported illegal immigrant, who was in fact a sportsman trying to break the triathlon record from London to Paris

Minutes later, the combined might of Kent Constabulary, Port of Dover Police, the coastguard and Border Force officials descended on Shakespeare Beach expecting to find a migrant struggling ashore after crossing illegally from Calais.

Instead, they discovered the 41-year-old athlete – who had simply been posing for a photo before starting the next stage of his record attempt at a London-to-Paris triathlon.

Luckily, Mr van Wisse and his team laughed off the official interruption as ‘priceless’.

And according to a witness, police – who arrived at the beach expecting to find one of the thousands of migrants who have been massing at a camp on the French coast – also saw the funny side.

Drama over, the Melbourne-based champion swimmer and cross-Channel veteran yesterday continued the middle leg of his 289-mile journey to run, swim and cycle between the English and French capitals.

Before setting off he explained: ‘It’s the hardest thing I know and I just want to see if I can do it. I know it’s going to be tough but I’m up for the challenge.’ 

John Van Wisse, 41, had run 86 miles from London to Dover, which he completed in 15 hours 53 minutes yesterday, and is currently swimming from Dover to Calais in tricky conditions 

Mr Van Wisse had just seven and a half hours rest between the run from London to Dover and swim to Calais 

Mr van Wisse started the 86-mile running stage at London’s Marble Arch on Tuesday.

It was timed to make the best use of tide times and conditions in the Channel, although it appears that news of his arrival might have escaped official logs in Dover.

Blessed with a prayer by an inquisitive priest who encountered him earlier in Canterbury (‘May you always stay afloat,’ the good Father said) he grabbed some slow-release energy from a takeaway pizza and few hours’ sleep before heading to the water.

Mr Van Wisse hopes to beat the current record of 73 hours and 39 minutes, held by Britain's Mark Bayliss

As he set off on the 21-mile swim from Dover to Calais, Mr Van Wisse was mistaken for an illegal immigrant

He completed the Channel crossing last night after 12 hours and 31 minutes. His team tweeted: ‘Next stop Paris!’

Mr van Wisse, who has completed a double Channel crossing and coaches other hopefuls, will now cycle the final 180 miles to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, aiming to arrive at mid-morning today.

His aim is to beat the current ‘Arch to Arc’ record of 73 hours and 39 minutes, held by triathlete Mark Bayliss from Croydon.

Provided, that is, someone has told the French gendarmes.
