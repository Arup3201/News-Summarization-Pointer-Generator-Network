The mystery daredevil who has posted photos and videos of himself on top of some of Seattle’s tallest buildings including the iconic Space Needle has revealed himself.

Real life spider man Joseph Carnevale, 25, likes to indulge his death-defying passion for what is known as ‘urban exploration’ or ‘recreational trespassing.’

Last month photos emerged showing what he claims is him sitting on top of the Space Needle during the time when the roof was painted Galaxy Gold.

The Space Needle is the most iconic skyscraper on the downtown skyline in Seattle

Photographer Carnevale says the Space Needle had fascinated him since he had moved to Seattle and that it took him ten months to plan and plot his trip to the top of the city's most iconic skyscraper.

Planning is key to ‘recreational trespassing’ and in the case of the Space Needle that involved Carnevale carrying out a trial run without tools to determine what security was like and if there were motion sensors in place.

Luck also played a key role and on the night that Carnevale achieved his goal everything worked in his favor from security not being as tight as it should have been to it not being a windy night.

Carnevale is often accompanied by friends on his daredevil mission, in Seattle he has also climbed The Great Wheel and CenturyLink Field.

‘We see a place we really want to get to, and we just try stuff,’ he told KPLU. ‘We don’t have death wishes. We’re fairly cautious. We take calculated risks.’

The
photo of Carnevale sitting on the roof peering down into CenturyLink 
Field at night captured the attention of the Seattle Seahawks who 
retweeted the picture with the caption, 'Whoa,' but that post was later 
deleted.

He estimates that he has climbed somewhere between 20 and 50 tall structures in a number of cities since 2007.

Also
among his top five climbs are the Golden Gate Bridge, the Chrysler 
Building, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Queensboro Bridge in New York.

He says he feels no fear of heights and has never had any accidents.

'I’ve always been comfortable in heights. I prefer being on high. It’s not just the photos for me. I love being in high places as much as the photo itself,' he said.

Some people have accused him of faking the photos, but he says the proof is in the resolution.

‘It’s really hard to fake, at least in the resolution that I posted these photos,’ he said. ‘I never met anybody who could whip that up in Photoshop. It’s pretty easy to tell if somebody is faking it.’

He has never been arrested for trespassing, although he has encountered security guards and janitors during his climbs.

Seattle police were investigating the Space Needle incident and could now track him down that he has revealed himself.
