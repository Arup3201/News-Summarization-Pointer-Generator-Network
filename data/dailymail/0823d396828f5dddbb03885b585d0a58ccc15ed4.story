A council that condemned payday loan companies and banned the website Wonga.com from all its public computers is jointly investing in the company, it has emerged.

Newcastle City Council is one of five local authorities paying into a pension fund which invested over £200,000 into the high-interest rate lender.

Though council representatives say they have no control over where the Tyne and Wear Pension Fund invests its money, the authorities collectively contributed over £170million last year.

Newcastle City Council has openly condemned the company in the past and waged a campaign against similar payday loan websites who 'harm the city'.

But alongside others, it paid into the fund whose top ten investments include Nestle, British American Tobacco and Tesco.

A spokesman said this morning: 'Newcastle City Council has no direct investments in pay day loan 
companies, and we will continue our vigorous campaign against an 
industry that we believe contributes to people’s debt problems.'

'We have in the past publicly voiced our dislike at the fact that the pension fund, which is not controlled by Newcastle City Council, chooses to invest in companies that we believe harm our city.'

Some fans vowed to boycott St James' Park Stadium after it was announced Newcastle United and Wonga had signed a lucrative sponsorship deal

The payday loan company signed a lucrative sponsorship deal with the club though many fans and local residents are not happy for the two to be affiliated

The Tyne and Wear Pension Fund has not responded to the Mail's requests for comment.

Newcastle United's decision to sign a
 sponsorship deal with Wonga earlier this year sparked outrage 
among local residents and MPs, with some vowing to boycott the club's 
home stadium as long as it was affiliated with the company.

City council 
leader Nick Forbes added: 'I'm sickened. It's a sad indictment of the 
profit-at-any-price culture at Newcastle United, the Sunday People reported.

'We
 are fighting hard to tackle legal and illegal loan sharking and having a
 company like this on every football shirt that's sold undermines all 
our work.'

The Archbishop of Canterbury said the Church of England is trying to dispose of its stake in Wonga which was revealed in July

The Church of England has also invested in the company despite the Archbishop of Canterbury's condemning of it.

Reverend Justin Welby said the institution is attempting to 'responsible dispose' of its stake in the company after it was revealed in July it had invested around £80,000.
