Lewis Hamilton feels his startling turnaround over the course of the British Grand Prix weekend has fuelled his belief anything is possible this season.

Hamilton recovered from another miserable qualifying run last Saturday, in which he made an error of judgement to hand Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg pole position, to take the chequered flag by the end of Sunday.

Starting from sixth on the grid represented the lowest position from which Hamilton has gone on to claim victory in Formula One, with 27 successes now to his name, matching that of three-times champion Sir Jackie Stewart.

Next step: Hamilton must now build on his Silverstone success in the German Grand Prix in Hockenheim

Crucially for Hamilton, Rosberg suffered his first retirement of the year and the gap between them heading into Sunday's home race for the German at Hockenheim is now just four points.

Given the euphoria from the fans that followed Hamilton's success at Silverstone, that weekend may well prove to be a turning point.

At the very least the 29-year-old now knows what can be achieved from one day to the next, no matter the circumstances.

'I look at it very positively, a massive turnaround that just shows you everything is possible, no matter how difficult or bad it is,' said Hamilton.

'Every day there is a new opportunity, and I now see an opportunity to turn things around while knowing there is still a long way to go.

'It's about making sure I have that mentality because there's going to be days when it's not going to be great, where there will be a Friday, Saturday or Sunday that doesn't work out.

'But then you know there is an opportunity the next weekend.'

For Hamilton, an error-free qualifying on Saturday is his first port of call to ensuring the confidence lift from Silverstone does not rapidly fade.

Mistakes have been made in the last three qualifying sessions that have proven costly for Hamilton.

'Looking at the races I'm confident I have the pace,' he said.

'Obviously the car is fantastic and I do have the pace to deliver, it's just because there is so much pressure there that sometimes you get it and sometimes you don't.

'I guess in the last three or four qualifying sessions I know I could have done better, but for the races I've done pretty well.

'They have always been strong, it's just the qualifying, and it's not been a huge, big, big problem.

'I don't need to change too much, just maybe small things.'

Closing in: Hamilton is now only four points behind Drivers' World Championship leader Nico Rosberg

Hamilton finished practice just 0.024 seconds clear of Rosberg in a now customary one-two for Mercedes, however, the opposition were closer.

The removal from all cars of the front-and-rear-interconnected (FRIC) suspension device that race director Charlie Whiting threatened to ban after suggesting it was illegal, may have played a part.

Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo finished a tenth of a second adrift of the Mercedes pair, whilst there were another six drivers within a second of the top two.

Jenson Button was seventh overall in his McLaren, 0.880secs down, with Marussia's Max Chilton 21st and 3.5secs back.
