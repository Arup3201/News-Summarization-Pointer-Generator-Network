When teenager Nawal Khasal came home to find a burglar stealing her family’s valuables, she instinctively knew what to do.

Grabbing a cricket bat from the porch, she knocked him for six.

The blow floored Derek Perry, 47, who fled the property with blood pouring from his mouth. But gutsy Miss Khasal was determined not to let the thief get away and chased him into a nearby cul-de-sac.

'Gut reaction': Nawal Khasa uses a plank of wood to re-enact the moment she hit burglar Derek Perry

Despite being repeatedly punched by 6ft Perry, Miss Khasal managed to hang on to him until police arrived.

Afterwards, Perry tried to claim Miss 
Khasal should be arrested for assaulting him. But officers disagreed and
 no action was taken against her.

Yesterday a judge praised Miss 
Khasal’s actions as he jailed Perry, who has 17 previous convictions 
dating back to when he was 13, for five years.

Judge Mark Brown, sitting at Liverpool
 Crown Court, said: ‘A householder is justifiably entitled to use 
reasonable and proportionate force to defend themselves and their 
property.

‘It’s clear that this is all Miss 
Khasal was trying to do. She acted with tremendous courage and 
determination. She is only 17 and is a great credit to people of her 
age.’

He ordered Miss Khasal be awarded £250
 and a judicial commendation, adding: ‘She was faced with a man of 47, 
who presents as a physically strong individual.

‘She not only stood up to him and gave as good as she received, but she then pursued him and tried to detain him.

‘It’s only through her actions that 
this crime was detected. I’m sure the public would applaud her actions. 
She is entitled to the thanks and congratulations of the court and the 
general public.’

Judge Brown’s comments come a 
fortnight after the Government announced it was strengthening the law 
allowing householders to defend their property against burglars.

Hero: Nawal sprung into action when she arrived home and noticed a hole in the front door

Judge Mark Brown's comments in full:

'There ought to be a judicial 
commendation as far as Nawal Khasal is concerned. This is only intended 
as a token mark of what she did but she will be awarded £250 out of the 
public purse.

'She acted with tremendous courage 
and determination. She was faced with a man of 47 years of age who 
presents as a physically strong individual.

'She is only 17 years of age. She is a
 great credit to people of her age. She not only stood up to him and 
gave as good as she received but she then pursued him and tried to 
detain him.

'When the police arrived she was able 
to make sure they were able to arrest him. It’s only through her actions
 that this crime was detected.

'I’m sure the general public would 
applaud her actions on this occasion. She is entitled to the thanks and 
congratulations of the court and the general public.'

Under the changes, anyone who is 
confronted by a burglar and has reason to fear for their, or their 
family’s safety and, in the heat of the moment, uses force that later 
seems ‘disproportionate’ will not be guilty of an offence.

The court heard the robbery took place
 on the afternoon of Sunday October 7 when Miss Khasal returned to her 
Liverpool home from the shops.

The trainee firefighter confronted Perry,
 who had sawn a hole in the front door, on the staircase.

Miss Khasal, 
who lives with her parents and three older brothers, said: ‘It was just a
 straight up, gut reaction.

‘I’d been out to the supermarket with 
my mum, we’d only been gone about 25 minutes but in that time he’d 
managed to saw a panel out of the front door and get into the house.

‘I saw him coming down the stairs with
 bags full of our stuff – he had the Xbox, a DVD player, CDs, mainly 
electrical things.

'I shouted at him and he punched me in the shoulder, 
so I hit him with the cricket bat.

‘It knocked him to the ground and the bat broke in half, so I know I hit him quite hard.

‘I had hold of him and he was punching and trying to fight free, but I managed to hold on to him until the police arrived.

‘It was scary because I didn’t know if
 there were any more of them in the house, but I suppose the adrenaline 
just kicked in. I just did it instinctively.’
