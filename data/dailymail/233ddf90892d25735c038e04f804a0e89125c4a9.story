Heiress Kate Rothschild has taken to Twitter to post a photograph of her children being returned to her by private jet with the caption 'plane relief', as she hits back at her husband in bitter row over her 'affair' with U.S. rapper.

Kate, who took to Twitter yesterday for the first time since news 
of her split with Ben Goldsmith emerged on Sunday, also posted a cryptic message which just reads 'talespins and 
head rolls'.

The tweet is likely to be a comment on how she feels her side of the story has been twisted.

Earlier
this week Kate put out a statement claiming “false and inaccurate” 
information had been give to the media “in a deliberate attempt to 
damage' her.

A few 
hours before the tweet Kate also posted the Instagram picture of her son
and daughter, who had been on holiday in Italy with their father and grandmother, 
Lady Annabel.

The children are shown emerging from a private jet with the caption 'plane relief'.

Despite
the furore surrounding their reported affair, Jay Electronica has 
publicly given the picture a 'like' which can be seen by any Twitter 
user accessing Kate's account.

Goldsmith, 31, has posted a 
series of angry tweets about his wife since it was revealed they had 
split after a furious confrontation over texts and emails between her 
and rapper Jay Electronica.

Heading for divorce: Multi-millionaire Ben Goldsmith with his wife Kate, whom he has branded 'appalling' over her relationship with a rapper

Ben Goldsmith was arrested
at the couple’s £20million home in Kensington, West London, last week 
on suspicion of actual bodily harm but released without charge after he 
accepted a caution.

The Eton-educated financier is now expected to issue divorce proceedings against his 29-year-old wife on the grounds of her alleged adultery.

Since tweeting about his upset he has been inundated with messages from supporters.

Claire Willows, one of Mr Goldsmith’s 6,000 followers on Twitter, sent one saying: ‘Can’t believe she called the police on you. You deserve sooooo much better than that.’ He replied: ‘Agree, appalling.’

Clare Magee, of Strabane, Northern Ireland, wrote: ‘Your wife is a fool, your [sic] gorgeous looking, even without the money.’

Mr Goldsmith, youngest son of the late billionaire Sir James Goldsmith, replied: ‘Very kind of you!’

Backing from women: Mr Goldsmith has been deluged with messages of support on Twitter since it was revealed he had split from wife Kate

Earlier, he hit out at reports that his estranged wife had taken on a public relations firm to advise her and accused her of caring more about her reputation than their three children, a daughter aged eight and sons aged seven and four.

He wrote: ‘@kateroundtable [his wife’s Twitter account] has hired Project Associates Ltd to fix her  reputation (bit late surely?). How about focusing on her devastated children?’

Mrs Goldsmith, a member of the Rothschild banking dynasty, hit back in a statement saying their children were her ‘main concern’.

A spokesman said she believed ‘false and inaccurate information’ had been given to the media and questioned if it was an attempt to ‘deflect from the gravity of last week’s incident involving the police’. He said she was ‘devastated’ and was seeking legal advice ‘on a number of matters’.

Meanwhile Jay Electronica, 35, whose real name is Timothy Elpadaro Thedford, has returned to London from his grandmother’s funeral in the US and tweeted ‘#LoveIsOnTheWay’.

Bitter feud: Mr Goldsmith hunting in the English countryside with rapper Jay Electronica, who has been exchanging messages with the financier's estranged wife

The Goldsmiths’ marital home was put on sale last month and friends said rumours of a split had been circulating because of the time Mrs Goldsmith was spending with the rapper.

Divorce lawyers believe the case is likely to be the first high-profile court case of the ‘Twitter generation’.

The Goldsmiths married in 2003, but their marriage ran into difficulties earlier this year.

She went into the music industry with a company called Roundtable Records and was said to be leading an ‘increasingly nocturnal’ lifestyle.

The couple had a trial separation before an apparent reconciliation, but Mr Goldsmith claimed to have discovered incriminating messages on his wife’s phone last week.

She denied having an affair but reportedly admitted it after her husband said he had read the messages. He was said to have slapped her and kicked a child’s toy at her during the row, and she called the police.

Several of Mr Goldsmith’s Twitter followers advised him not to air his marriage problems on the site. One wrote: ‘In the heat of heartache one tends to unveil more than necessary. Don’t bring your issues to tweet, it will hurt; pray instead.’

Mr Goldsmith replied: ‘Thanks, I agree. You’re kind.’
