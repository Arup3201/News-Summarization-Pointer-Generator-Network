Group A: Equatorial Guinea, Burkina Faso, Congo, Gabon

Group B: Zambia, Cape Verde Islands, Democratic Republic of Congo, Tunisia

Group C: Ghana, Algeria, Senegal, South Africa

Group D: Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Guinea, Mali

Ivory Coast have been pitted against Cameroon in Group D after the draw for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, while Algeria and Ghana have been paired with each other in Group C.

Cameroon hit form to thrash Ivory Coast 4-1 during qualifiers in September, a result that the likes of Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony will look to avenge when they meet in Equatorial Guinea.

Group C is the most eye-catching  of the competition, as South Africa and Senegal will also compete to make the knock-out stages.

Algeria impressed during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, reaching the last 16, while Senegal's attack will be spearheaded by Newcastle's Papiss Cisse.

Group B comprises Zambia, Cape Verde, Tunisia and DR Congo.

Elsewhere, Equatorial Guinea are in Group A alongside Congo,  Burkina Faso and Gabon, where all eyes will be on Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

Equatorial Guinea are hosts after Morocco withdrew from holding the competition in November. The tournament will take place from January 17th - February 8th.
