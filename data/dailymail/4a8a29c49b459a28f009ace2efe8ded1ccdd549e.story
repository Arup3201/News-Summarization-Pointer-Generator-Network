A former policeman who regularly beat his wife because it was 'part of the culture' in their home country of Romania has been jailed after moving to Britain.

Narcis Ioo, 44, who speaks little English, admitted threatening to kill his wife and assaulting her before he was jailed at Gloucester Crown Court.

However, he has now been granted immediate release from prison after his battered wife Veronica said she did not want to see him locked up.

Romanian-born Narcis Ioo, 44, who moved to the UK a couple of months ago, admitted threatening to kill his wife Veronica (pictured right outside Gloucester Crown Court) and assaulting her while drunk on July 17

Ioo, who is suffering from cancer, was arrested on July 17 after flying into a fit of rage after downing half a bottle of whisky at the couple's home in Dursley, Gloucestershire.

In anger, he threw a laptop across a room before grabbing a knife from a kitchen drawer and threatening to stab the pair's 20-year-old son Paul, the court heard.

Their son rang his mother for help and she overheard on the phone that Ioo was making threats to kill her.

When she got home, Ioo kicked both her and Paul and police were called to the scene.

Ioo was taken into custody – where he has been for the last 27 days – and held until yesterday's court hearing.

However, after admitting the offences, Judge Jamie Tabor QC passed a 54-day sentence, which enables Ioo to be released on parole either today or tomorrow.

The judge also made a seven year restraining order banning Ioo from seeing or contacting his wife except for a maximum of once a week by phone.

Mrs Ioo, who has been in the UK working to pay off debts incurred by her husband's medical treatment in Romania for the last two years, made a plea to the judge for him to be released because she said she still loves him.

She told the court that her husband had a good well-paid position in the Romanian police for 19 years and when he was struck with cancer, she moved to the UK with their son to get work which would pay for his medical treatment. He joined the pair a couple of months later.

Ioo was arrested in July and held in custody until he was jailed for 56 weeks at Gloucester Crown Court (above). He will now be immediately released from prison after his wife pleaded for him to not be locked up

She said it was the culture in Romania for men to beat their wives and said it happened to her – but she did not hold that against him.

'He has hit me before, but never told me he was going to kill me. He was very, very drunk,' she said.

'I will never have a problem with the justice system here, but it is hard for me to see my husband in jail.

'But the real punishment for my husband is that he is without his family.'

However, she also said was fearful of remaining with him and said she was prepared to pay for him to go back to Romania.

But the court was told that he does not want to leave the UK and has been offered a home and work by fellow countrymen in Bristol.

Sabhia Pathan, defending, said Ioo had resigned his post in the Romanian police force as a result of his wife and son settling in the UK and came here to join them and re-establish the family.

Until then he had been the main breadwinner but he had not found work in this country.

He still had a mortgaged house in Romania but was in arrears and if he went back he would not be able to find work or afford a home, she said.

Passing sentence on Ioo, Judge Tabor said 'Your wife plainly still retains a great deal of affection for you.

'She has told this court that when in Romania you beat her regularly. Interestingly, she made no complaint about that for she says that it is part of Romanian culture. It is not part of British culture.

'When men beat women they are regarded as cowardly criminals.

'What she drew the line at however was when you threatened to kill her. That is what has brought you to this court today.

'You are a man without convictions who has been very unwell and you were in a foreign country. I take all that into account.

'The fact is that however fond of you though she be she has had enough of you. My principal task today is to protect her from any further violence.

'Do not hit any more women or young people and in no circumstances ever pick up a knife again.'
