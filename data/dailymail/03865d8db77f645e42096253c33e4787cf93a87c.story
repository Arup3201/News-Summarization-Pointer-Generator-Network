Emperor Nero: History has painted him as a cruel leader, but the poem romanticizes his life

An ancient Greek poem praising the wife of the infamous Roman emperor Nero has been discovered in an Ancient Egyptian town.

The poem treats Poppaea Sabina, the wife of the cruel leader, as a goddess - describing her ascending into the heavens and painting a touching portrait of the couple.

Due to the lettering style, researchers believe the poem was written around AD300 - two hundred years after Nero's death, leaving a mystery as to why someone more than 1,400miles from Rome would wish to write a tribute so many years later.

Nero has gone down in history as one of Rome's most cruel, depraved and megalomaniac rulers, often indulging in orgies and blamed for a devastating city fire which allowed the emperor to rebuild the city to his own tastes.

Poppaea was also criticised at the time. When, according to ancient records, Nero killed his first wife Octavia, Poppaea was said to have been presented with her head.

She then convinced Nero to commit matricide and was, according to the records, the real power behind the throne.

But the poem sees Poppaea in a different light, with the goddess Aphrodite welcoming her to the stars, telling her: 'my child, stop crying and hurry up: with all their heart Zeus' stars welcome you and establish you on the moon...'

The poem was discovered 100 years ago - but was only recently translated.

Two excavators, Bernard Grenfell and 
Arthur Hunt, found hundreds of thousands of scrolls in ancient city 
dumps in Oxyrhynchus in Egypt.

The town had a population of around 
10,000 at the time of the Romans, and the papyri contained thousands of 
records and details of life in the era.

The
 process of translating is still continuing years down the line and the 
team, according to Live Science, did not know what to expect other than 
the scroll contained a poem in Greek text.

It turns out the poem, in early history's answer to Romeo and Juliet, shows Poppaea lamenting over her lost lover.

According to Live Science the poem reads: '[S]he was downcast and did not rejoice in the offered (favour). For she was leaving her husband, (a man) equal to the gods, and she moaned loudly from her longing...'

Poppaea then ascends to the stars, crossing the planets then known to mankind, including 'the 
Cyllenaean star' (Mercury), 'belt of the Aegis-bearer' (Jupiter) and 'Rhea's bedfellow' (Saturn).

When she arrived 'under a clear (moon), the dance of the blessed (gods) she 
viewed'.

Then, she went out alone into the darkness of the North Pole, 'looking around for her husband under the darkness...'

Where in the world? Oxyrhynchus, near Cairo, is more than 1,400miles from Rome

Theories about the range from the suggestion that it was originally composed in the time of Nero and was retold over the next 200 years before being written down in Egypt, to this being a poem written about an Egyptian officials death, which used Nero and Poppaea as an example of star-crossed lovers.

Paul Schubert, a professor at the University of Geneva, who led the research, said it was possible such poems were written for members of the Roman imperial family after they 
died.

He said: 'There is a possibility that the poem we have here recovered 
actually belongs to this lost genre, but we can't be sure.'

Emperor Nero was the fifth and final Roman Emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and inherited the throne and the title Caesar from his adoptive uncle Claudius.

The notorious emperor reigned from 54 to 68 AD, and his name was a byword for dissolution, cruelty and excess.

n 64AD two-thirds of Rome was destroyed in a great fire and Nero famously rebuilt the city after the fire in the Greek classical style, including his lavish Golden palace.

Rome burns; History tells us Nero sat playing his fiddle while Rome burned to the ground

Described by Suetonius as one of Rome's most cruel, depraved and megalomaniac rulers, Nero often indulged in orgies. Fancying himself an artist, he entertained guests at his palace with his own performances of poetry and songs

However Nero did not enjoy the frescoed halls and gold-encrusted ceilings for too long. It was completed in AD 68 - the year he committed suicide after his legions and bodyguards rose against him and the senate declared him a public enemy.

Many Romans at the time believed the fire and ensuing destruction had been a ploy for the emperor to indulge his aesthetic tastes, despite his having been at his villa in Antium, 56km away, at the time.

The stories tell of Nero unconcernedly playing the fiddle while the city burned.

He blamed the Christians, then a minority sect, for the fire, and persecuted them. Early Christian tradition holds Nero responsible for the deaths of the Apostles Peter and Paul.

After Nero's suicide, the palace was stripped of its marble, jewels and ivory, and within a decade the site was filled in and built over.

It was eventually rediscovered in the 15th century after a local fell through the ground and into the remains of the structure.

Within days people were letting themselves down on ropes so they could admire the frescoes that remained,Â  among them artists Raphael and Michelangelo who carved their names on the walls.
