Found sleeping: Charles Franklin (pictured) denies raping a lesbian on a pub floor in Clifton, Bristol. He says he offered to charge her phone and 'one thing led to another'

A lesbian wedding guest has recalled her horror at waking up after leaving the reception in the early hours of the morning to find she was being raped, a court heard.

The 30-year-old was described as being 'a couple of drinks away from paralytic' when she left the function.

Her next memory is waking up naked on the floor of Somerset House pub in the upmarket area of Clifton, Bristol, being raped by Charles Franklin, a jury was told.

She alleges he threatened to break her neck if she struggled and only managed to escape by climbing out of a window after he fell asleep.

Franklin, also 30, denies rape and claims that 'one thing led to another' after he offered to charge her mobile phone at the pub.

In a police interview the day after the alleged assault, the woman told officers she left the function at 1am after 'a lot of drinking'.

She could not remember leaving but analysis of the alcohol in her system showed she had three times the drive-drive limit at 3.45am.

'The next thing I remember was being on the floor of this pub with a guy,' she said. 'He stripped me. He was trying to force himself on me. I was struggling quite a lot.

'He told me if I kept struggling he would break my neck, so I let him do what he wanted.'

After the attack the man sat at the bar and watched TV while she lay naked on the floor, she claimed.

'I managed to find my coat and I pretended to be asleep so he wouldn't come back,' she said.

'I looked around to see where the doors were. I decided to get up to see if there was a toilet or a window.'

She said she could not find a way out and the pair went upstairs to a bedroom where the man tried, but failed, to have sex with her again before falling asleep.

The alleged victim then put on Franklin's jeans and T-shirt before climbing out of a window.

Charles Franklin is pictured leaving Bristol Crown Court where he is charged with raping a lesbian. He was found by police the morning after the alleged assault asleep in the Somerset House pub (above right) in Clifton

Once out of the pub she went to a kebab van and borrowed a mobile phone to call her mother, who came to pick her up.

'She got straight in the car and said, "I've been raped",' her mother told Bristol Crown Court.

Police later found Franklin's wallet in the jeans pocket and tracked him down to the pub, where he was still asleep at 9am.

Nurse Michelle McTigue, of The Bridge sexual assault referral centre in Bristol, said she examined the woman and found she had cuts and scrapes to intimate areas.

Franklin, of Withywood, Bristol, denies rape and attempted rape.

The case continues.
