A woman who sustained horrific injuries when she was run over by her pampered dog has been awarded a $143,590 compensation injury payout.

The pet lover, who is in her sixties and does not wish to be named, was returning to her car after walking her three much loved dogs in February 2005 when the incident occurred in Colac, a small city in the Western District of Victoria. 

She had left her keys in the ignition to turn on the air conditioning for her pooches as it was an extremely hot day, before putting two of her dogs in the back seat and one in the front passenger seat.

As she went to get into the driver’s seat one of her dogs knocked the hand brake, releasing the car and starting it rolling, while the woman had her arm caught in the door.

She was dragged along with the car until eventually falling to the ground.

As she did so the car run over the top of her, causing extensive injuries to her back, neck, shoulders, and left hip.

Her claim for lump sum compensation was this week awarded by the Transport Accident Commission.

Her lawyer, Ann Cunningham from law firm Stringer Clark, told Daily Mail Australia: 'I really thought "I've seen it all now".'

'The hardest thing about this case was the multiple injuries and the time it took waiting for them to stabilise.

‘She had many surgeries, including a hip replacement and a bilateral shoulder replacement,' she added.

The TAC has offered to pay $143,590 to the woman as a lump sum compensation amount, in addition to the payment of medical expenses and income entitlements.

Mrs Cunningham said: ‘Obviously, there was no liable party in this accident, and while it has its humorous dimension, the major injuries caused were no laughing matter for the woman concerned.

‘While this is a highly unusual car accident, it underlines the point that TAC offers nofault compensation payments to help injured people in their rehab and to get on with their lives as best they can.

‘In my experience, people in regional areas are reluctant to pursue their injury entitlements, but it is important to bear in mind that we pay our car registrations and insurance premiums precisely so that we are covered should we suffer serious injury.’
