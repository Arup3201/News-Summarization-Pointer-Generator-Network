The madness that is the summer transfer window finished with a manic transfer deadline day, with some eye-catching new recruits for some of the top Premier League sides.

With the international break almost over and the Premier League returning this weekend with some mouthwatering fixtures, what better time than to refresh your MailOnline Fantasy Football side than right now.

Here, Sportsmail has picked 10 of the best deadline-day signings who should be given serious consideration when you look to make changes to your side.

Exciting: (left to right) Radamel Falcao, Hatem Ben Arfa, Marcos Rojo and Danny Welbeck all moved clubs

Radamel Falcao (Manchester United) - Fantasy Football value: £10.3m

One of the most surprising moves on deadline day, but also one of the biggest. Falcao guarantees United goals - and he can also guarantee you points if you select him.

Despite having to compete with Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney for a starting place up front at Old Trafford, no club pays someone £280,000-a-week and a £6m loan fee if they do not intend to start them.

The 28-year-old Colombian scored 13 goals in 22 games at Monaco last season, he netted 70 times in 91 appearances for Atletico Madrid and he struck on 72 occasions for Porto in just 87 matches.

Falcao is the sixth-most-expensive striker in the game at £10.3m, yet he is well worth the investment because he will bring you point after point with his goals.

Even worth a serious consideration as your captain. 

New boy: Radamel Falcao joined Manchester United on a season-long loan deal this summer

Goal machine: Falcao's form for Monaco prompted United to bring the Colombian to Old Trafford

National service: Falcao in action for Colombia in a friendly against Brazil last week

Danny Welbeck (Arsenal) - Fantasy Football value: £9.0m

Arsenal needed to sign a striker and they have poached one of England's brightest talents from United with the £15m signing of Welbeck.

Welbeck found himself out of favour under Louis van Gaal at United but, if he is given the role as the main striker at Arsenal in Olivier Giroud's absence, then the 23-year-old can bring goals.

He may have only scored 20 goals in 92 appearances for United but Welbeck has been deployed on the left or brought on from the bench a lot at Old Trafford, which have affected his statistics. His two goals for England in Switzerland prove he is on a hot streak of form too.

Given the correct service, a run in the side and the fact he has the ability to provide assists for his team-mates, at £9.0m - and with 23 strikers costing you more on the game - he could be a shrewd signing. Southampton's Jay Rodriguez (£9.5m) and West Ham United's crocked striker Andy Carroll (£9.2m) will cost you more! 

Still in red: Danny Welbeck switched from Manchester United to Arsenal in a £16 million deadline-day move

Double trouble: Welbeck slots home his, and England's, second goal as they saw off Switzerland

Hatem Ben Arfa (Hull City) - Fantasy Football value: £6.7m

Alan Pardew decided he could no longer put up with Ben Arfa at Newcastle United but the Frenchman has moved to Hull with a point to prove.

A return of 14 goals and 18 assists in 86 appearances on Tyneside prove what Ben Arfa is capable of when he is on song and motivated, so the KC Stadium may be in for a treat.

There are 41 midfielders who will cost your more than Ben Arfa (£6.7m) - including Crystal Palace's Jason Puncheon (£7.6m) and Chelsea's Mohamed Salah (£7.4m) - and the 27-year-old Frenchman is certainly worth consideration for your side. 

New face: Hull City signed Hatem Ben Arfa on loan from Newcastle United for the remainder of the season

Up in arms: Ben Arfa was frustrated by his lack of playing time at Newcastle but can thrive at Hull

Marcos Rojo (Manchester United) - Fantasy Football value: £5.8m 

The Argentine has a fiery temper but he is a player who Van Gaal was keen to bring to Old Trafford - even waiting several weeks for his work permit to finally be ratified, meaning he qualifies for this list despite having been signed a couple of weeks before the deadline.

Five red cards in Portugal for Sporting Lisbon suggest the 24-year-old could cost you points through his discipline but he should excel in defence in a very new-look United side.

At £5.8m, Rojo is the 22nd most-expensive defender - cheaper the Manchester City's Matija Nastasic (£6.0m) and Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho (£5.9m) - so his disciplinary record is almost certainly worth the risk. 

Desperate: Marcos Rojo can't wait for his Manchester United debut after receiving his work permit

In action: Rojo played in the 4-2 victory for Argentina over Germany on Wednesday night in Dusseldorf

Toby Alderweireld (Southampton) - Fantasy Football value: £4.9m

Southampton held off competition from Newcastle for Alderweireld's signature on loan from Atletico Madrid.

The 25-year-old is tall and powerful and will prove an excellent replacement for the departed Dejan Lovren in the Saints defence.

There are 47 defenders who will cost you more than Alderweireld (£4.9m) - including Hull's Michael Dawson (£5.2m) and Man United's Chris Smalling (£5.4m) - meaning the Belgian is a bargain.

New boy: Toby Alderweireld poses in his Southampton shirt after sealing a season-long loan move

Heads up: The ex-Ajax man struggled for playing time at Atletico, prompting his move to the Premier League

Daley Blind (Manchester United) - Fantasy Football value: £5.8m

Another player who has been brought to United by Van Gaal, Blind could also benefit from the new-look side.

The 24-year-old is highly regarded in his native Holland and he will provide assists - just like the one for Van Persie's wonder-header during the World Cup - as well as shore up United's defence.

With 21 defenders more expensive than Blind (£5.8m) - including Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs (£6.0m) and United team-mate Luke Shaw (£6.0m) - he can prove a cheaper alternative.

New beginnings:  Daley Blind joined Manchester United in a £14million move from Ajax on deadline day

International pedigree: Blind's performances at Ajax have made him a regular in the Dutch national team

Abel Hernandez (Hull City) - Fantasy Football value: £8.1m 

The Uruguayan has yet to fulfil his potential but Steve Bruce was confident enough to spend a club-record £9.5m to bring him to the KC Stadium.

A return of 36 goals in 122 games for Palermo is solid if unspectacular but, with his pace and power, Hernandez can provide assists as well as finding the net.

Stoke City's Jonathan Walters (£8.3m) and Newcastle's misfiring forward Papiss Cisse (£8.4m) are just a couple of the 33 strikers who will cost you more than Hernandez (£8.1m), even if the 24-year-old's price tag still seems a little steep.

New arrival: Abel Hernandez completed a £9.5m club-record move to Hull City from Palermo on deadline day

Decent record: Hernandez netted 14 times for Palermo as they were promoted from Serie B last season

George Boyd (Burnley) - Fantasy Football value: £5.4m

Hardly a marquee signing but 28-year-old Boyd could provide Sean Dyche's side with some much-needed attacking firepower.

Goals have been hard to come-by in recent years for Boyd but he has found himself in and then out of the side - and assists are a regular feature for a man who Burnley can build their attack around.

With 104 midfielders costing you more than Boyd (£5.4m) - including Everton's Bryan Oviedo (£5.9m) and West Bromwich Albion's Silvestre Varela (£5.9m) - he is worth at least a spot on your bench as backup.

Done deal: George Boyd has completed a move to Burnley after failing to hold down a regular place at Hull

Flourish: Boyd is hoping to get regular game time at Burnley and help keep them in the Premier League

Sadio Mane (Southampton) - Fantasy Football value: £5.8m

This 22-year-old Senegalese midfielder is exciting fans on the South Coast - and from his statistics you can see why.

With 45 goals in 87 appearances for Red Bull Salzburg in Austria, Mane has figures worthy of a striker.

What's more, Mane (£5.8m) is just the 93rd most-expensive striker on the game - with Hull's Robert Snodgrass (£6.2m) and Newcastle's Yoan Gouffran (£6.1m) cost more. What a bargain!

New man: Sadio Mane signed for Southampton from Red Bull Salzburg for a fee in the region of £12million

Clinical: Mane scored an incredible 45 goals in just 87 appearances from midfield for Red Bull Salzburg

Ricardo Alvarez (Sunderland) - Fantasy Football value: £6.6m

Alvarez could be key to Sunderland's chances in the league this year and he could also be crucial to where you finish in your Fantasy Football league.

A return of 14 goals and 19 assists in 90 games for Inter Milan show just how many points Alvarez could accrue for your side.

The Argentinian is cheaper than 43 other midfielders - including Man City's Frank Lampard (£7.0m), who is unlikely to play, and Sunderland team-mate Adam Johnson (£7.2m) - meaning he is excellent value for money.
