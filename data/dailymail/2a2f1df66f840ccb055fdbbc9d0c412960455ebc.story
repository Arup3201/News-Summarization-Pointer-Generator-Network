The gun found near Osama bin Laden's body when he was killed by  U.S. Navy Seals has gone on display at the CIA headquarters.

The CIA's collection of unique artifacts from 70 years of major historic events, including bin Laden's gun, are on display to CIA employees only at their secretive base in Langley, Virginia.

The AK-47 was recovered from the Abbottabad compound after bin Laden died in a midnight raid in May 2011.

Personal weapon: The CIA's collection features this assault rifle found near Osama bin Laden during the raid on his compound in Abottabad

Most wanted: Osama bin Laden, often pictured armed in videos and interviews, was eventually killed by U.S. special forces in May 2011

It was analysed and found to be a Russian AK-47 with counterfeit Chinese markings.

CIA museum curator Toni Hiley told NBC in their exclusive tour of the museum that the explanation for the Chinese markings remains a mystery.

The careful planning of the raid is also recorded in the CIA's collection, with the model of the compound that former CIA director Leon Panetta used to plan the mission and part of the life-size mock-up of the compound used to practise the raid, on display.

The mock-up of the Abbottabad compound 
turned out to be pieced together so accurately from intelligence reports
that when the seals entered 'they said ‘We felt like we'd been there 
before,'' Hiley told NBC as she showed them around private museum.

Watershed moment: Bin Laden's Pakistani hideout, where the AK-47 was discovered after he was killed

Last pictures: This video seized from the walled compound in Abbottabad, showed some of the last images of bin Laden alive

Tense moment: President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, along with with members of the national security team watching the bin Laden raid from the White House

Although the CIA had thought since 
September 2010 that Bin Laden was in Abbottabad, it waited to attack until May 2011.

It 
found bin Laden's hideout by tracking a man identified as his key courier. 
When the courier was found in Abbottabad, the CIA began the surveillance 
that led to the raid.

After careful practice on the CIA's model of the compound, the raid was planned for May.

Via a video camera fixed to the helmet of a U.S. Navy Seal, the President and his staff at the White House saw the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks shot in the left eye.

The Seal then carried out what is known as a ‘double tap’ – shooting him again, probably in the chest, to make certain he was dead.

Following the raid, relations between Pakistan and the West were put under intense strain amid disbelief that intelligence chiefs in Islamabad had no idea Bin Laden was living only 800 yards from the country’s leading military academy.

Rare access: The exhibits at CIA Headquarters, Langley, Virginia are not open to the general public

Pieces of history: CIA museum curator Toni Hiley showing NBC's Richard Engel other remarkable artifacts, such as the Enigma machine

Other recent museum acquisitions from the War on Terror include a partially-burned al-Qaeda training guide to firing surface-to-air missiles found in Afghanistan, as well as the raw lapis lazuli used to pay its members.

The displays began in the early 1990s but the
museum's collection starts with the agency's origins running spy 
networks in the Second World War when it was known as the Office of Strategic Services, through its Cold War years and right 
up to the War on Terror since 9/11.

The OSS wing of the CIA’s museum, which 
opened in 2011, traces the history of an organisation that was 
founded in 1942 to aid resistance fighters before it became the CIA in 1946.

The exhibit 
from the Second World War period includes counterfeit German postage stamps created by the OSS , the desk of OSS director William 'Wild Bill' Donovan, and a selection of false identification documents, maps and escape equipment.

There is a further layer of top secret artifacts that are not on display even within the CIA.
