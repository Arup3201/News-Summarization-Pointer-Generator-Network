Sir Jonathan Ive is said to be so proud of the upcoming iWatch, he has been boasting the device could seriously disrupt the watch trade in Switzerland.

An Apple designer claims Sir Jonathan told him the watch-making nation is in trouble because of the much-rumoured wearable - although he is reported to have said a much stronger word than trouble.

The iWatch is expected to be unveiled at an event next week, but won’t be on sale until early 2015.

London-born Sir Jonathan Ive (pictured) is said to have made the claims to an Apple designer. Apple’s senior vice president of design was making reference to Switzerland’s watch trade. Sir Ive was responsible for the iMac, iPod and, more recently, the iOS 7 software redesign

London-born designer Jonathan Ive is Apple's senior vice president of design.

Since 1996, he has been responsible for products including the iMac, which ultimately led to the design of the iPod, and more recently Sir Ive was behind the drastic redesign of iOS 7.

He was knighted in 2012. 

Ive also leads the Human Interface (HI) software teams across the company.

Outside of Apple, Ive has designed products for charitable causes, including a Leica camera for a charity auction, and a Jaeger-LeCoultre sports watch for an AIDS-charity auction.

The claims were made in a feature by the New York Times that discussed how tech was combining with fashion as wearables become more popular.

It said: 'According to a designer who works at Apple, Jonathan Ive, in bragging about how cool he thought the iWatch was shaping up to be, gleefully said Switzerland is in trouble - though he chose a much bolder term for ‘trouble’ to express how he thought the watchmaking nation might be in a tough predicament when Apple’s watch comes out.’

This suggests Ive believes brands such as Tag Heuer and Breitling face tough competition from the wearable device.

Reports claim Apple will charge around $400 for its iWatch, but this would still put it behind the luxury price tags of Swiss watches.

Sir Ive believes brands such as Tag Heuer (pictured) face tough competition from Apple's wearable device. Reports claim Apple will charge around $400 for its iWatch, but this would still put it a long way behind the luxury price tags of Swiss watches. Tag Heuer watches, for example, sell in excess of £700 ($1,150)

Tag Heuer watches, for example, sell in excess of £700 ($1,150). 

This price, would however, put Apple’s iWatch at the high-end of the smartwatch market - a strategy that mirrors the firm’s approach to its iPhone business.

By comparison, Samsung’s Gear 2 costs $299.99 in the US (£249 in the UK) and the Moto 360 is expected to cost $249.99 (£149).

Last week, Samsung launched its curved S watch, but didn’t announce how much it would cost.

Apple’s biggest rival could be waiting to see how much the iWatch will cost, if it is unveiled next week, before setting its own price.  

Apple began filing patents for a wrist-worn device in 2011, although at that point the firm referred to the device as iTime. It is expected to run the next-generation iOS 8, and feature health sensors that will work with Apple’s HealthKit tools. The iWatch is expected to launch next week with the iPhone 6 (concept pictured)

Apple began filing patents for a wrist-worn device as early as 2011, although at that point the firm referred to the device as iTime.

It is expected to run the next-generation iOS 8, and feature health sensors that will work with Apple’s HealthKit tools.

It could also feature near-field communication (NFC), its own 3G connectivity and sync with the next model of iPhone, also expected to launch on Tuesday next week.
