Birth rates among Polish women rise by two thirds when they move to Britain, official figures showed yesterday.

Those who migrated here after 2004 have an average of 2.13 children compared with the 1.30 level seen in their native land.

Romanians have enjoyed an even bigger baby boom – producing 2.93 children in Britain but only 1.25 back home.

New figures from the Office for National Statistics shows women from Romania have the highest fertility rates in England and Wales

The
 women may have been playing ‘catch-up’ after delaying pregnancy ahead 
of emigrating, the Office for National Statistics said. But higher 
income – whether in wages or benefits – and  better schools and living 
conditions in Britain, may also have encouraged the extra births, the 
agency added.

Its report on 
childbearing rates among British-born and foreign mothers suggests that 
the immigrants likely to come from Romania and Bulgaria following the 
lifting of labour market  restrictions in January will  push up the UK 
population with their offspring.

UK-born women in England and Wales have an average of 1.84 children in a lifetime

The
 ONS report, based on 2011 and 2001 British census findings, and records
 held by the EU statistics arm Eurostat, aimed to throw light on why 
birth rates among migrants are much higher than for their counterparts 
born in this country.

The 
overall fertility rate of women born in Britain was 1.84 in 2011 – up 18
 per cent since 2001. Among foreign-born women, it was 20 per cent 
higher, at 2.21 births.

The 
2011 census recorded a 3.7million population increase in England and 
Wales over the decade, around two thirds of it brought about by 
immigration and high birth rates among migrant mothers.

‘Fertility
 rates in Poland and Lithuania were very low, as in much of Southern and
 Eastern Europe,’ the ONS said. ‘But the fertility rate of women born in
 these countries living in England and Wales was relatively high, above 
that of UK-born women.’

The 
report said this meant migration was altering the childbearing rate of 
Eastern European women, or that women who migrate are different from 
those who stay at home. Another explanation was that ‘conditions were 
better in England and Wales  for childbearing than in Poland or 
Lithuania’.

The report 
pointed to the catch-up effect, adding: ‘If the support – financial, 
social, educational – for childbearing and family life is better or 
worse in England than in the population’s country of origin, this may 
have an effect on the number of children they choose to have.’

Poland, Pakistan and India top the league table of countries by number of births

Fertility
 rates among migrants were highest among mothers from Africa and lowest 
among those from Australia and New Zealand, the ONS said.

There
 were also low fertility rates among migrants from China, South Korea, 
Singapore and Germany, where some British women who are now having 
children were born as daughters of British service families.

Women
 from Singapore showed fertility rates of 1.1, whereas mothers from 
other parts of Asia were much more prolific. The birth rate among women 
from Pakistan was 3.82 and from Afghanistan 4.25.

Libyans
 and Algerians boasted among the highest figures – 5.58 and 4.32 
respectively. Women from Botswana and South Africa had fertility rates 
below British-born women.
