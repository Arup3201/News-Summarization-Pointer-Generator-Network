Style icon and occasional-designer Olivia Palermo has collaborated on a capsule collection of shoes for luxury Italian footwear label Aquazzura.

Named Aquazzura x Olivia Palmero, it consists of six styles - including over-the-knee boots and snakeskin pumps - and will hit 12 global retailers in September, ranging in price between $600 and $1,625.

'Everything is so expensive these days,' Ms Palermo, 28, aptly stated to WWD. 'And you still want to have things that you can find and have quality and the design aesthetic and be happy.'

Ms Palermo, who tied the knot with dishy model Johannes Huebl, also 28, last month, has long been a fan of the Florence-based label's elaborate footwear.

'Olivia basically has been our unofficial ambassador,' said Aquazzura designer Edgardo Osorio. 'She’s always wearing the shoes.

'We’re friends and we were talking more than a year ago about a small capsule that would be Olivia’s eye and aesthetic but with the Aquazzura style.'

One pair of jewel-encrusted stilettos was inspired by a vintage Victorian necklace belonging to Ms Palermo, and the collection also includes gladiator sandals, pumps, and a suede bootie, according to the publication.

Saks Fifth Avenue will stock the Fall collection, as will Lane Crawford, Tsum and Holt Renfrew; while Net-A-Porter will be the only online retailer to sell them.

It's not the newlywed socialite's first foray into the arena of designer collaborations. In 2010, she launched a jewelry line with Roberta Freymann, and the following year, she was invited by Stuart Weitzman to design a shoe for charity.

Last month, she designed a capsule collection of sunglasses for Westward Leaning, retailing for $210 a pair.

If her apparent Midas touch with Westward Leaning's wares is anything to go by, her Aquazzura collaboration is likely to be a storming success.

'No other person... has the kind of conversion power that Olivia has,' Westward Leaning's co-founder Robert Denning said last month. 'When Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez broke up, he left wearing the pair of sunglasses we’d gifted Selena.

'I thought it would lead to a huge spike in sales, but didn’t move the dial at all.'
