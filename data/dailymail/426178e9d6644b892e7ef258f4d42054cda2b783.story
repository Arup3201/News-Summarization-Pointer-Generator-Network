A weasel proved that it is more of a handful than a mouse when it prevented its owner from playing on his computer. 

Recording the encounter at home, the video maker waits poised with his hand on the computer mouse as the little mammal named Ozzy watches.

After flicking his thumb a few times he gets the weasel’s attention and invites the onslaught from his cute and cuddly attacker.

Diving at his thumb, the weasel rolls underneath it and begins nibbling on it as it curls itself up into a ball.

Before retreating, looking around and repeating the process – this time clinging on to the thumb.

Spinning onto its back, Ozzy casually looks at the camera and bares its teeth before flipping back onto all fours with great agility and attacking the man’s hand once more.

Retreating behind the computer’s speaker, the weasel runs back and forward in between its rough-and-tumble.

Before momentarily choosing to ignore the thumb and come right up to the camera to stare down its lens curiously.

After more of the same, Ozzy runs off behind the keyboard and the video maker is left twiddling his fingers.

According to the owner, the weasel is fully grown and always in the mood for fun and games.

But, writing on his YouTube channel, he also noted that weasel’s should not be considered pets.

He wrote: ‘They hate being locked up, they're not friendly when hungry. Don't get one. Seriously. Ozzy is a special case rescue baby. Cute, but deadly.’

The least weasel, as Ozzy's type is known, is native to Eurasia, North America and North Africa, though it has been introduced elsewhere.

Despite the mammal’s small size, it has the capability of killing a rabbit five to ten times its own weight.

And a mouse (and a thumb) is clearly no match for it either. 

The adorable animal has become so popular on YouTube, its owner has even set up a Facebook page in honour of Ozzy The Weasel, complete with videos, pictures and updates.
