Cheesy and proud: The Labour leader happily picked sing-a-long anthems to soundtrack his desert island

As he said himself, no one ever accused Ed Miliband of being cool.

And after his appearance on Desert Island Discs this morning, that's not going to change any time soon.

Unveiling his favourite eight tracks of all time, the Labour leader named A-ha, Robbie Williams and Neil Diamond in a pop-heavy playlist.

It is a far cry from his political rival, Prime Minister David Cameron, who used his chance as a castaway to name-drop indie hits and student favourites by Radiohead, The Smiths and REM.

He rebuked a suggestion by Kirsty Young, presenter of the BBC Radio 4 show, that politicians use the list to boost their image.

Asked how many advisers had looked at the list beforehand, Mr Miliband, 43, said: 'It's absolutely my list. It's a list that is personal to me - some people will not like some of the songs and that's as it should be - but this is a list I chose.'

He opted for stirring tunes such as the South African national anthem and Jerusalem and a personal tribute to his father with the left-wing anthem The Ballad of Joe Hill.

To complete the collection, he requested sing-a-long anthems Take On Me by A-ha and Angels by Robbie Williams.

He also reserved a spot on his island for
Je Ne Regrette Rien by Edith Piaf, famously sung by former chancellor 
Norman Lamont in 1993 at a press conference when asked what he regretted
most: singing in the bath after Black Wednesday, or promising 'green shoots' of recovery.

His desert island luxury was a regular chicken tikka curry takeaway and his book was Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

In his interview, Mr Miliband admitted
his relationship with brother David has still not fully ‘healed’ 
following his decision to stand against him for the Labour leadership.

He
said their 2010 leadership battle was ‘really, really tough’ on those 
close to him and that he had ‘possibly underestimated’ the emotional 
impact his decision to stand would have on his family.

The Labour leader, who is not religious, also described about the moment he prayed to God to save his dying father.

Mr Miliband, 43, still regards older 
brother David as his ‘best friend’ but says their relationship is 
‘healing’ rather than healed.

‘It has been incredibly tough. Really, really tough. I didn’t take this decision lightly.

‘I
knew it would have an impact on my family, on him... It was hard for my
family. It was hard for David. It was very hard. But I suppose I felt 
that it was the right thing,’ he said.

Mr
Miliband adds that he and his brother avoided confronting each other 
about their rival ambitions before the leadership contest, adding: ‘We 
probably danced around it a bit because neither of us particularly was 
desperate to confront it.’

Today's
list is a change from the one he compiled for Labour Uncut in the run 
up to the party leadership election in 2010, when he picked an iPhone 
for his luxury and the more high-brow Ulysses as his book.

Although Robbie Williams, A-ha and The Ballad of Joe Hill appeared on his 2010 list, he has made some revisions.

Cool list: As leader of the opposition, David Cameron requested student favourites such as Radiohead

Eclectic: His coalition partner Nick Clegg put Shakira alongside Prince and David Bowie in his 2010 interview

Josh Ritter's song Good Man has been replaced by his other track Change Of Time.

Two 1980s hits - Billy
Bragg's song A New England and Caravan of Love by the Housemartins - 
have gone, replaced by Jerusalem and the South African national anthem.

And he now prefers Neil Diamond to early-2000s indie band Hard-Fi.

His brother and competitor, David, also shunned current music in favour of Elton John, Sting and The Beatles.

By
way of contrast, Mr Cameron - who was at the time heading the 
opposition when he appeared on the Radio 4 show in 2006 - packed his 
selections with tunes which made him look as though he was seeking the 
cool vote.

He included Bob Dylan, The Killers and Benny Hill's comedy hit Ernie as a novelty extra.

But his cool list was chided by the bands themselves.

Paul Weller and The Smith's guitarist Johnny Marr both spoke out to inform the then-leader of the opposition that they would rather not count him as a fan.

Nick Clegg, who appeared on the show in 2010, had something of an eclectic selection, featuring Radiohead and David Bowie alongside 80s pop classic Prince and Shakira's World Cup anthem Waka Waka.
