Like most people her age, Celestina Ramljak has been planning a 21st birthday celebration to remember.

However, a lack of funds and a looming deadline meant the 20-year-old from Miranda, south of Sydney, may have been forced to cancel the milestone event.

So at the recommendation of some of her colleagues, she launched a crowdfunding project to  keep her party dreams alive.

Ms Ramljak told Daily Mail Australia she had a rude shock after putting a deposit on a venue this week.

‘This week I put a deposit on basically the smallest place I can host everyone I love. After I crunched the numbers on alcohol and food, I realised there’s no way I could raise the money by the time my birthday comes around in April.’

Ms Ramljak has only just started working after finishing her degree.

‘I travel an hour to and from work every day, and I’ve be been financially helping my family. After six months of saving, I’m nowhere close to the amount I need for the party,’ she said.

Ms Ramljak’s family are also unable to help her pay for her party, but they have offered to pay for the cake.

Ms Ramljak now faces losing her $500 deposit, as well as the celebration she has been planning for months.

This week, some work colleagues recommended she launch a crowdfunding page to raise the $2000 she needs to host the event.

‘I figured people use crowdfunding for anything, so why not give it a go? In one day I have already had seven donations.’

When asked why the party was so important to her, Ms Ramljak said she feels obligated to hold it because of her social circles.

‘All my friends have had big 21st birthday celebrations, and by going to all of those I feel sort of obliged to offer something in the same vein,’ she said.

‘Aside from that I feel like it’s probably the biggest milestone in becoming a real adult.’
