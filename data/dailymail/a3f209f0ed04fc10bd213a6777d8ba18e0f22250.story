Tragedy: Kyle Winterbottom, 16, fell 40 foot to his death from a third-floor balcony while at a party in Oldham, Greater Manchester

A teenage boy who plummeted 40 feet to his death at a party may have had his drink spiked with ecstasy and ketamine - a veterinary drug used to sedate horses.

Kyle Winterbottom, 16, lost his footing and fell to the ground from a third floor balcony rail while trying to climb down to a flat located on the floor below.

The teenager - a talented rugby player, boxer, and swimmer - was taken to hospital but later died from multiple injuries. 

Tests have revealed he had traces in his system of ecstasy and ketamine, a powerful drug used as an anaesthetic by vets.

Police were today asked to reopen the 
investigation in to Kyle's death after his friend told an inquest drugs 
were slipped into his drink before the party at an apartment block in 
Oldham, Greater Manchester.

Coroner Simon Nelson adjourned the 
hearing after friends and family insisted Kyle did not ever use ecstasy 
or ketamine and may have unwittingly taken both without knowing.

The
accident occurred in August last year after Kyle met friends for drinks
before going to a party being held in a flat on the third floor of the 
apartment block. He was apparently trying to climb to another flat 
located on the second level of a building where a different party was 
being held when he fell.

Joy
Conroy, 16, a close friend of Kyle said: 'At first he seemed normal - 
he was having a joke with everyone. I had no concerns. But at the party 
when I was on the balcony he came out with his head in his hands. He 
seemed angry but I didn’t know why.

'He
seemed in a bit of a mood but I didn’t know why. He just looked angry. 
He went downstairs was gone for about four minutes and when he came back
upstairs I asked him "what’s up?’" Kyle said, "I f****** love you" and 
gave me a hug. I said, "I love you too" and I just thought he was being 
nice.

'But then he turned and he had his back to me. When
I walked over to him, he was sat on the balcony with his back to me. I 
was at the side of him, when I grabbed his right hand.'

Joy said she was worried he may fall and urged him to get down but told the hearing Kyle said: ‘Joy get off me, f****** get off me’

She told the inquest she eventually gave up and turned away for a few seconds before looking back round to see just Kyle’s curled finger tips holding on to the top of the wall. His little and ring finger slid off off the ledge before Joy heard a thud below.

Joy immediately ran down stairs and saw a crowd standing around Kyle. He had been put in the recovery position and onlookers were screaming.

In her statement, she added: 'I couldn’t bear to look at Kyle. My hope was when paramedics placed him on a board that he was going to be okay - that was the last time I actually saw him and I still can’t believe what happened.'

She added: 'I heard rumours that he had been spiked, that it had been put in his drink. I heard that a day or two after it happened, and that it happened before he got to the flat.

'I think he might have tried to climb down to the lower balcony.'

Neighbour Jon Price an insulation engineer who lived in a flat on the second floor said: 'I opened the front door and I immediately saw two legs - it appeared that the person was hanging from the balcony above.'

He heard a scratching noise, as 
though the boy was moving his feet against the wall, but the boy then 
fell backwards to his death.

'The
person fell and he had landed on a gate below. He toppled and bounced 
off the gate to the floor.

'People were saying he had fallen, saying he 
had tried to jump from one balcony to the balcony below.'

Adjourning the inquest Mr Nelson said: 'I am concerned about the origin of the Ecstasy and the Ketamine.

'I
feel it is essential that the possible involvement of a third party 
with regard to the distribution of those drugs or the ingestion of those
drugs against the will of the deceased is found out. That can only be 
done if there is a thorough investigation.'

An inquest in to Kyle Winterbottom's death heard that he had traces of ecstasy and ketamine in his system

He said he was also concerned to hear that the youths were extremely abusive to the attending paramedics and police officers attending the scene.

Kyle Winterbottom's sister Keelie, pictured after the inquest, welcomed the reopening of the investigation in to her brother's death

'I find it extremely distasteful and upsetting when somebody is in desperate need of attention.'

Kyle, the third youngest of eight 
children to parents Joanne and Jimmy, was set to receive good GCSE 
grades from Hathershaw College in Oldham.

He took part in a triathlon event in Liverpool and played rugby for the youth team at Oldham St Annes Rugby Club.

Outside court, Kyle’s uncle Allan 
Winterbottom, 39, said: 'He was a top lad, a loving kid. He was there 
for all of his mates. We are shocked with the police investigation, 
Joanne has been trying to call them so many times but they don’t return 
her calls.

'I have 
heard so many rumours to just leave it at that but I am hoping that it 
was a tragic accident. We’ve had no closure at all, We just want the 
truth.

'Kyle loved his rugby and a natural boxer. He would train in Shaw and enjoyed getting his fitness up.

'He
was naturally gifted at boxing, but he wasn’t competing yet. He was a 
bright lad and had everything going for him, he gained 13 GCSEs. He had 
his whole life ahead of him.'

Sister
Keelie, 20, said: 'He was the best brother, we were so close. There was
eight of us all together and we miss him terribly. I am really happy 
police are going to investigate further so we can find out what really 
happened.'

It’s a powerful general anaesthetic that’s used for operations on humans and animals but is becoming increasingly popular as a party drug. The effects don’t last long, but until they wear off, ketamine can cause a loss of feelings in the body and paralysis of the muscles. It can also lead to users experiencing a distortion of reality.Ketamine, a Class C drug, can:
