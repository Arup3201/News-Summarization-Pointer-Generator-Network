A secret-sharing app which allows people to post anonymous confessions is vulnerable and puts the identity of users at risk, it has been revealed.

Secret has attracted gossip lovers who can post their own embarrassing admissions online while judging the deepest secrets of their friends and contacts.

But 'white hat' ethical hackers  Benjamin Caudill and Bryan Seely were able to identify the names of people behind the  posts by using personal email addresses and 'dummy' accounts. 

According to hackers, Secret - the app allowing users to post confessions anonymously - is vulnerable and puts the identity of the users at risk

Users can join the app by simply providing a phone number, email address or Facebook account.

Once a member, you are then able to see and comment on secrets posted by your friends, and friends of friends, because of an algorithm that tracks contacts. 

Examples of the messages include: 'Am applying for jobs while still at work' and 'Secretly excited for the new Taylor Swift single, I am a 30 year old [sic] dude.'

By filling their contact list with fake profiles and one genuine profile, the hackers were able to identify the secrets admitted by the genuine friend. 

Using this method, the pair were also able to see that Secret's chief executive David Byttow had posted via the app: 'Is Lucy the cutest dog?'

Sometimes companies bring in hackers to try and highlight flaws in their systems. Mr Caudill said his attempted breach was an experiment. 

The messages are shared with Facebook contacts and friends using an algorithm designed by Secret, allowing other users to comment on the posts  

Mr Caudill told the Washington Post: 'We were able to manipulate the process of adding friends to the app and replace real "friends" with dummy accounts we created, causing the application to believe we have a large group of friends and that any one friend's secret would be anonymous.

'In actuality, only one real person was added – the victim – so any secrets from friends would be identified as theirs.'

Byttow, who is also the co-founder of Secret, admitted in an interview last week: 'We do not say that you will be completely safe at all times and be completely anonymous.' 

Some of the admissions published by users are serious, while others are more light-hearted 

The potential flaws in the supposedly 'secret' apps have come to light in recent months, with the identity of users at risk of being revealed. 

Snapchat, the popular photo sharing app, settled with the Federal Trade Commission and accepted 20 years of monitoring by FTC regulators over charges that it deceived users. 

What the company promised users - that photos shared with friends will disappear once they are seen - isn't always true.
