The grieving mother who lost her two sons in a house fire started by their father has revealed how her boys quoted Buzz Lightyear in their last words to her.

Darren Sykes, 44, lured his two boys Jack, 12, and Paul, nine, to the attic of his house in Penistone, South Yorkshire, then set a fire downstairs and closed the loft hatch with all three inside.

Now, their mother Claire Throssell, 42, has revealed how when she left the boys at school that morning, Jack told her ‘To infinity and beyond, mum’ - before Paul said: ‘To infinity and back.’

Speaking of her sons quoting the Toy Story films, she told the Daily Mirror: ‘It rips my heart apart thinking about their last words to me. But I am so glad they knew I loved them. They were my life.’

Flames swept through the semi-detached house last October where the boys were staying with their carpet salesman father. Neighbours said they heard no screams or cries for help from inside.

The bodies of Mr Sykes and Paul were found in the loft and Jack was rescued still conscious by firefighters from the bottom of the loft ladder - but died five days later in hospital from burns.

Miss Throssell said she believed Jack attempted to save his brother, adding: ‘I think he tried to drag Paul out of the attic by his arm. Paul had a little scratch on his nose and drag marks on his arm.

‘Jack fell trying to protect his brother and ended up at the bottom of the ladders in a heap. I’m so proud of him, proud of them both and that pride will never die. They were brothers to the end.’

Miss Throssell also revealed in the interview with Mirror reporter Lucy Thornton that she married Mr Sykes in 1998 after they met at a carpet firm where they both worked and he wooed her with roses.

But she added that he became ‘controlling’ over the family after their birth of their sons, and would regularly lose his temper and criticise her for being ‘fat’. They later divorced.

Now Miss Throssell – who had her first Mother’s Day without the boys yesterday – said she has been helped through her grief by sleeping in the boys’ bedroom, and has their ashes in a ring.

Two weeks ago,  a coroner recorded that Mr Sykes committed suicide, while the verdict on the two boys was unlawful killing.

The inquest in Sheffield heard that before he died from burns in hospital, Jack managed to tell police it was his father who started the fire - saying: 'My dad did it on purpose.'

Mr Sykes, worried over access rights to his children, had 'coldly planned' the fire at his home 'with the specific purpose of ending two young lives', the hearing was told.

The inquest heard that Mr Sykes felt 'the world was against him' after a meeting with Cafcass - which represents children in family courts - two days before the tragedy.

He formed the impression that Paul had said he only wanted to see his father for one hour a week during a discussion over visiting rights.

Mr Sykes lived in Penistone after the split with his wife - and his sons lived with her at their grandmother's home in nearby Thurlstone.

On the morning of the fire he contacted an investment company and withdrew his assets, transferring them into a female third party's account.

He spent £600 on model railway track and equipment and sent a text to both his sons asking them to attend the former family home that evening to play with the new train set and be 'engine drivers'.

Mr Sykes then bought petrol cans, fuel and posted letters to family and friends - and deliberately parked his van away from his house so neighbours would not realise anyone was at home.

He picked up his sons on the evening of October 22 last year to play with the model railway and while they went up to the loft, he set the fire.

Family: In a statement to an inquest earlier this month, Miss Throssell said her 'boys meant the world to me'

The inquest heard that after he had barricaded the door after lighting a fire in the bottom floor of the house, he then came out of the house through the patio doors and walked round to the front door, letting himself in and locking it behind him.

He took the keys upstairs before lighting more fires on the first floor, including in the children's bedrooms. Once this was done he then entered the loft, closing the hatch behind him.

Mr Sykes sent the same text to six separate people saying he was 'going to be at peace'. A minute later, neighbours spotted the blaze and the fire service were called with the downstairs well ablaze.

Cord had been tied to the front and back garden gates as a barricade and a dining chair placed between the kitchen door and the door to the stairs so nobody could escape downstairs.

Petrol was used as an accelerant to start the fire with 16 pools of fuel on the ground floor and first floor. A patio door had been left partly open downstairs to fan the flames.

In a statement to the inquest earlier this month, Miss Throssell said: 'My boys meant the world to me. They were both polite, well-mannered and caring, and you can't imagine life without them.'

Buzz Lightyear is a space ranger hero and action figure owned by a boy in the Toy Story films. Last November his catchphrase 'to infinity and beyond' was voted the greatest line in movie history.
