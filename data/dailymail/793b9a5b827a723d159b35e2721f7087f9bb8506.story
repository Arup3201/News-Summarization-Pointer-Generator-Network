More than 1.5million older people may
have hidden a serious injury, illness or accident from friends or 
family in the past five years, according to a survey.

It
found one in six of the UK’s ten million over-65s say they have covered
up problems because of fears they will lose their independence or be 
seen as burden.

Of these, 12 per cent said they thought they would be judged as incapable of looking after themselves.

Secret: A survey has found that more than 1.5million older people may have hidden a serious injury, illness or accident from friends or family

Campaign: This Morning Presenter Ruth Langsford, pictured with husband and co-host Eamonn Holmes, is backing a campaign encouraging families to talk about home care

Half wanted to avoid friends or family 
over-reacting and two thirds didn’t want to worry them.

One in ten said 
they were scared about going into hospital.

The research found more than one in five over-65s fear being seen as a burden to friends or family as they grow older.

The online research commissioned by support provider Centra surveyed 2,000 adults aged  65 to 93 in the UK.

This Morning presenter Ruth Langsford is backing the campaign to encourage families to talk about how care and support in the home can stop relatives suffering in silence. 

She said: ‘I’ve come up against some serious barriers when it comes to talking with my own parents about their wellbeing as they got older.

'My mum is a fiercely independent 83-year-old but she lives alone now.

'We constantly worry that she is covering up problems and concerns so that we don’t see her as a burden.’

Age UK’s Caroline Abrahams said: ‘Worrying as these figures are, they come as no surprise.

‘With the constant conversation about the impact of our ageing populations on NHS costs and the rest of society, older people will often go out of their way to avoid involving friends and families when they have an accident, serious injury or illness.’
