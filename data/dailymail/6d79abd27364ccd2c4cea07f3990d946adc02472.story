A man has died after being struck by a speeding Porsche in a suspected hit-and-run incident.

The 26-year-old, named locally as Craig Rodger,  passed away this afternoon after being struck outside The 
Spread Eagle pub in Chorlton, Manchester at 10.30pm yesterday.

Witnesses say the man was thrown into the air after he was struck by the black Porsche Panamera.

A burnt-out £50,000 Porsche was found close to a scene where a man was killed in a suspected hit and run

He then landed around 20ft down the road, they say.

Rebekah Riley, a 21-year-old student who lives nearby, spotted the blaze as it broke out at around 11.30pm.

She said: 'I thought I'd heard people walking around but that's normal for that time. I heard a massive bang, like a gunshot, and a car alarm going off. I went outside and there was a massive blaze.'

Development worker Tom Stanley, 25, who also lives nearby, said: 'It just burnt and burnt - they must've poured petrol on it to get it to burn like that.

'Things kept popping off it, the tyres popped, we kept thinking the petrol tank was about to go.

'The fire brigade came after about 15 minutes and it took them a long time to put it out.'

Devastated friends left floral tributes at the scene. One reads: 'Rest in peace Craig. Heaven has gained an angel.'

Another says: 'Rest in peace Craig. Lots of love, Sarah.

Friends also paid tribute on Facebook in the hours after his death.

The car was dumped following the hit and run. Police do not know whether it was reported stolen

Lifelong friend Rayford Beaumont said: 'I'm shocked with the news I've just heard. Rip Craig. We grew up together. I spoke to him last night. I just can't take it in.'

Craig was crossing Wilbraham Road when he was struck by the Porsche.

The car was later found burnt out nearby on Brookburn Road.

A 32-year-old man has been arrested this afternoon in connection with the incident.

Investigating
 Officer, Sergeant Lee Westhead said: 'We are continuing to investigate 
this collision where a young man has tragically lost his life.

An investigator searches for clues on the car. A man has been arrested in connection to the death, police say

'We would ask anyone with information to contact police urgently.

'A dedicated team of specialist officers are now investigating this collision.'

The Panamera - believed to be a £120,000 hire car - was dumped and set on fire after the incident.

Today, investigators were examining the wreckage of the Porsche - which can reach speeds of up to 160mph - for clues.

Forensic officers hope their investigations will lead to clues as to the owner's identity

Police have appealed for those with information to come forward urgently
