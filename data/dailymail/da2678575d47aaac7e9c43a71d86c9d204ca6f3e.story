Naked dog door girl revealed: The girl who gained widespread internet notoriety when she crawled naked through a stranger's dog door has spoken out to tell her side of the story

A Texas woman who won internet infamy last year for crawling through a stranger's dog door naked has spoken out to reveal the motives behind her seemingly bizarre action.

Sara Soto, who was 25 when she became 'naked doggy door girl,' told her side of the story to MTV in a bid to legitimize the strange decision she made in spring 2012.

Instead of a wild night of boozing and partying, her telling begins with her parents admitting to her for the first time that she is adopted.

'I’d just found out I don’t know who my father or mother is,' Soto told MTV while explaining that the situation was too much to handle, so she got in the car and just drove west.

'I had spun out of control because of an 18-wheeler, and I wind up in a ditch. I manage to make it out of there, walk down the freeway,' she said.

There were offers for help, but Soto said they were from creeps. She managed to make her way to a police station, where an officer took her report.

'I explained to the cop where it happened. He gets my car towed,' she said. However, Soto claims the police did not offer to allow her to use the phone to call for help.

With no one to drive her home, Soto set off down an unfamiliar road in the town of Weatherford, some 60 miles from home at around midnight.

'I walk toward some houses,' she told MTV. 'Maybe somebody will let me use their phone. I knocked on six houses and nobody opened the door.'

Scared, alone and in a strange place, Soto, who is an amateur rapper and goes by the name Sara Toke-a-lot, hatched her plan B.

Good plan? Soto says her march toward infamy started when her parents told her for the first time hours before that she's adopted. She took off and go into an accident. One thing led to another and she was naked in a stranger's home looking for a phone to call home for help

'If I take off my dress at this doggy door,' she remembered thinking. 'I cannot get blamed for stealing anything.'

This is where Soto's story and the one told to millions on the internet differ: most people believe she squeezed her tiny, 110 pound frame through the pet door. Soto claims she merely reached in and unlocked the door.

Soto, an amateur rapper who goes by the name Sara Toke-a-lot, was issued an arrest warrant the very day she told MTV her side of the story--it would be her third stemming from the incident

Either way, she made it into the home, but says an alarm soon went off. Panicked and unable to see a phone, she hid in a bathtub.

It was there that at least her plan to disarm the homeowners with her nudity worked. The husband of the couple who lived there had a decidedly collected reaction when he found her.

‘Honey, there’s a girl in the bathroom,’ he said to his wife, who understandably told him to call the cops.

Upon her arrest, Soto claimed she was not intoxicated, though the authorities would tell MTV that she was likely high. However, at one point she was transferred to a psychiatric facility before she finally made it home.

Soto continues to maintain she was not stoned, but unfortunately for her the legal woes from that April night continue to haunt her.

Thanks to some continued infractions, Soto had an arrest warrant issued on the very day she spoke to MTV, her third stemming from the incident.

To this day, she claims she's recognized by people and for that reason has not applied to a job. Instead, she's getting her rap career on track.

'I’m happy about it, I’m already working on my music. I didn’t mean to do all this,' she told MTV. 'it was like a publicity stunt, but I didn’t do it for that. I’m just wild and free, and that’s what America’s supposed to be about, right?'
