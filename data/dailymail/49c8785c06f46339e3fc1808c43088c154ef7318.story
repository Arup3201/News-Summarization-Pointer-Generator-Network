A vegan student was ‘disgusted’ when he found a dead fly the size of a 50p inside a loaf of bread as he went to make a sandwich. 

Samuel Backon, from Bournemouth, made the grim discovery just as he was about to butter a slice of the thick white bread he bought from his local Costcutter.

He had thought the black spec wedged into the bread was a cockroach, but following an investigation, Kingsmill confirmed it was a fly.

'Disgusting': Vegan Samuel Backon found this insect in a loaf of Kingsmill bread. He had thought it was a cockroach, but Kingsmill confirmed it was in fact a fly

Bread and butter: Mr Backon, 18, was buttering his bread when he made the gruesome discovery

The 18-year-old said: ‘I was going out with friends and was putting together a packed lunch.

‘I took out a piece of bread and was just about to butter it when I noticed a little black speck.

‘At first I just thought it was a bit of mould or something but then I took a proper look at it and behold, there was a dead insect wedged inside the slice.

‘I was absolutely disgusted.’

Mr Backon said the insect was approximately the size of a 50 pence coin.

The teenager bought the loaf from his local Costcutter store. 

Mr Backon took the loaf back to his local Costcutter in Bournemouth and they exchanged it immediately

He said: ‘I took some pictures on my phone. Then I took it back to Costcutter to get a new one.

‘They were really good and exchanged it straight away.

I can’t bear to think that I could have actually eaten the insect if I hadn’t spotted it. I think I will be sticking to Hovis from now on.’

A Kingsmill representative visited Mr Backon’s home and launched an investigation into the gruesome discovery.

A spokesperson said: ‘After receiving Mr Backon's complaint, we collected the product for analysis.

'We can confirm that the object is not a cockroach, but a fly. On initial inspection we believe that the fly has not been baked, and it most likely entered the loaf post production, rather than on our site.

'We will be able to confirm this after further testing.’

A spokesperson for Costcutter said: 'Quality is a priority for Costcutter Supermarkets Group and all of its retailers, particularly when it comes to products.

'It is unfortunate that this particular loaf of Kingsmill bread was purchased in one of our stores.

'We hope Kingsmill will swiftly deal with the situation to Mr Backon's satisfaction and ensure it does not happen again.'
