Many buildings in Northridge, California have not been changed to prevent earthquake damage even as today marks the 20th anniversary of the disaster that struck the area of northern Los Angeles.

While there has been progress to rebuild and shore up freeways and hospitals, there has been less attention paid to concrete buildings and housing with ground-floor parking.

'That remains a significant problem. We really have not come very far,' said Jonathan Stewart, an earthquake engineer at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Sudden: Los Angeles police officer Wayne Dean, whose body is covered by a blanket as his colleagues as they investigate, was one of the victims in the 1994 quake which was a 6.7-magnitude disaster

Damage: The January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake was felt over a broad area of Southern California, causing widespread death and destruction

At 4.31am on January 17, 1994, the ground shuddered beneath the bedroom community of Northridge, due to a magnitude-6.7 earthquake.

After the shaking stopped, sections of the city laid in fiery tatters.

Several dozens died and 9,000 were injured. The quake caused $25billion in damage - the costliest U.S. natural disaster at the time.

The largest cluster of deaths occurred at the Northridge Meadows complex where 16 people were killed when their first-floor apartments crashed onto the parking garage below.

The city doesn't keep count of how many so-called soft-story buildings exist and doesn't require mandatory repairs even after 1994 because many such buildings survived the shaking.

The Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety recently proposed surveying 30,000 apartments built before 1978 to determine which might be compromised during violent shaking as a first step toward possible retrofitting.

Small victories: Because the earthquake happened at 4.31am, there were very few people on the highway

The department has yet to receive funding to start the work.

After
 Northridge, the city required fixes to some 200 steel-frame high-rise 
buildings that unexpectedly suffered cracked welds and 2,750 concrete 
tilt-up buildings - erected with concrete walls and lifted into place by
 cranes - that were poorly designed. Both types of repairs were 
relatively easy and did not bankrupt property owners.

Even
 so, computer simulations released this week by the California Institute
 of Technology and U.S. Geological Survey found mid-rise steel buildings
 performed differently depending on the type of welding.

Other retrofits were voluntary including efforts to buttress concrete-frame buildings.

There are about 1,500 such buildings in Los Angeles County and between 16,000 and 17,000 statewide.

Only
 about 10 to 15 per cent are considered dangerous, said Craig Comartin, 
who led a study by the Concrete Coalition, a volunteer group of 
scientists, engineers and governments.

Earlier this week, the city announced 
it would partner with the USGS to develop a plan to address seismic 
safety, including ways to get privately-owned buildings to be more 
quake-proof.

'We're as well 
prepared as any city in America, which is to say we're unprepared,' 
Mayor Eric Garcetti said in an interview with The Associated Press.

'I don't think anybody in America is very well prepared ... There's always going to be an earthquake we can't be prepared for. '

At least 57 people died, according to the state. A 1995 study put the death toll at 72, including heart attacks.

Despite
 the lag in reinforcing potentially dangerous buildings, strides have 
been made in beefing up state-owned freeways and bridges by wrapping 
support columns with jackets of steel.

Several
 freeway bridges that collapsed or were heavily damaged had been 
retrofitted decades earlier, but the efforts were limited to tying 
structures together using restrainers at the bridge joints. Techniques 
have since evolved.

Since 
Northridge, the California Department of Transportation spent more than 
$1 billion to further brace 1,155 bridges identified as at-risk. Only 
two projects remained - a freeway overpass in Oakland that's scheduled 
to be completed this fall and the Schuyler Heim Bridge in Long Beach 
that's due in 2017.

Two 
hospitals suffered major structural damage, prompting lawmakers to 
require hospitals statewide to strengthen buildings so they can still 
treat patients after a disaster.

Out
 of 1,313 hospital buildings deemed at risk for collapse, 69 percent 
have been retrofitted, replaced or demolished. The work continues 
despite extended deadlines.

Northridge was the last deadly quake to strike a U.S. metropolitan area.

Wendy Yost lived through it. A student and resident adviser at California State University, Northridge, Yost awoke to a messy dorm room and a waterlogged bathroom after the toilet came off its base.

Though the school was on winter break, some students stayed behind. With a candle in hand, Yost dodged broken glass in the hallway, knocking on students' doors to get them to safety.

'This wasn't my first rodeo when Northridge happened,' said Yost, who also survived the Loma Prieta quake that rocked the San Francisco Bay area during the 1989 World Series.

Those born after 1994 have never experienced a major temblor. And for many who lived through Northridge, 20 years of relative seismic calm may lull some into a false sense of security.

'People forget,' said Tom Jordan, who heads the Southern California Earthquake Center at the University of Southern California.

'It's been ungodly quiet from a seismic point of view since Northridge.'

To prevent amnesia, scientists and emergency responders have held an annual preparedness drill since 2008 to educate Californians and residents in other quake-prone states to 'duck, cover and hold on' during shaking.

Northridge exposed a hidden fault. Afterward, scientists scoured for similar geologic structures lurking around the Los Angeles basin.

Five years later, they discovered the Puente Hills fault that runs underneath downtown Los Angeles that could cause far greater damage. Budget cuts through the years have slowed efforts to map potentially dangerous fault lines.

By seismic standards, Northridge wasn't a monster in terms of its strength or the destruction it wrought. Northridge didn't cause mass casualties like the 2010 quake in Haiti did, but a future quake certainly could.

If a segment of the 800-mile-long San Andreas Fault unzipped and unleashed the 'Big One' as scientists call it, it would cause far greater chaos to lives, properties and lifelines including roads, pipelines and telecommunication systems.

Despite intense study, there's no magic bullet that allows scientists to predict when a quake would hit.

'We're chipping away at it,' UCLA's Stewart said of the retrofit process.

'We're not where we would like to be, but we are making progress toward hardening the system.'
