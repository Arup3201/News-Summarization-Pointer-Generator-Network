Accuser: Jance Hancock, pictured in the 1970s, alleged that Travis had indecently assaulted her

The woman whose indecent assault claims dating back to the 1970s triggered the prosecution of Dave Lee Travis said last night she was ‘not bitter’ about the verdict, but hoped it would not ‘wreck’ Operation Yewtree.

Jane Hancock, 54, said she was in ‘shock’ at the trial’s outcome – but said she was thankful it had given a ‘voice’ to her and the other women who accused the DJ of molesting them.

Even though the jury rejected her account and found Travis not guilty, she told the Daily Mail: ‘I am disappointed and I am shocked, but I don’t feel hard done by or sour grapes. I’m not bitter.

‘I’m glad I did what I did and I respect the jury’s decision. I just hope the police continue to take women’s claims seriously and I hope other people aren’t put off coming forward.

‘I feel, please God, let Yewtree continue with the same vigour. They must not think that they have failed.’

Last night she said giving evidence had been tough but that she would go through it again, even though Travis had been cleared.

‘It was one of the hardest things I  have ever done, but if I had to go through all of this again, I would. I really would,’ she said.

‘Historical cases are always difficult for jurors. We knew that. They have a difficult job. The verdicts are a shock.

‘I’m just blown away really. It must have been well nigh impossible for the jury. The fact they couldn’t decide on two counts shows how hard it was.’

Miss Hancock also expressed her sympathy for Travis’s other accusers, saying: ‘I’m gutted for all of the girls. They must all be feeling terrible. But they should all know that what we did was very brave.

‘The original fear, at the start of all this, was simply that I wouldn’t be believed. I totally respect the jury’s decision and it clearly wasn’t an easy one for them.

‘Nothing changes the way I feel about what happened all those years ago.’

She added: ‘I don’t feel let down by the police, not at all. They have worked very hard and they have given us a voice. I think that’s the most important thing of all, even if the verdict is disappointing.

‘It is just nice to know that we are being listened to, even if in court it is impossible to prove so that the jury can totally believe. But, no, I praise Operation Yewtree.’

It was Miss Hancock’s claims that triggered the police investigation into Travis. She was a 17-year-old archivist working at BBC Broadcasting House in London when she met the DJ in the 1970s.

She told the jury he had given her lifts in his famous ‘big yellow banana’, a Pontiac Firebird Trans car, but had assaulted her in a  BBC studio in 1977 while he was live on Radio 1.

Claims: The accusations had related mainly to Travis's time as a BBC DJ in the 1970s and 1980s

She accused him of switching off the studio light and putting on a ‘smoochy’ song, before grabbing her tightly to dance.

Claiming he was aroused, Miss Hancock said: ‘I was horrified. I didn’t know what it was. It sounds stupid but I was still a virgin.’ He pinned her against the wall and thrust his fingers into her underwear, she alleged.

But the jury rejected her claims and cleared Travis of indecently assaulting her.

In a separate interview she told ITV News that there should not  be a ‘sell-by date’ on complaints, adding: ‘I worry that the verdict will prevent other people from coming forward.

‘It’s tough enough anyway and the precedent is still to be made, in so much that it will put people off in coming forward with complaints about abuse that they’ve received – whether it be last week or 30 years ago. But my message to anybody who is listening is please don’t be put off.

‘Although it’s tough to go through the trial, and to be in court and to be cross-examined, you’ve done something valuable.

‘It’s quite scary what they will drag up from your own past in order to cast doubt in the jury’s minds. But having said that, I would still happily do it again.

‘I think that there has to be some kind of understanding that in an historical abuse claim, some of the witnesses will have forgotten, some of them will be dead.

'The fact that you didn’t complain at the time implies that there is a sell-by date, if you like, on a complaint.’

Miss Hancock, of Surrey, decided to waive her legal right to anonymity in return for a donation to the charity Victim Support. She has never asked for any payment for herself.

Relief: Travis, shown in a court sketch expressing his relief at the not guilty verdicts, told the jury: 'It's their word against mine'

She added that she saw no reason to ‘hide’ and that she wanted to give encouragement to women in other cases.

In October 2012, at the height of the revelations about Jimmy Savile, Miss Hancock phoned the then BBC director-general George Entwistle to report her accusations about Travis, but said his office dismissively told her: ‘We are not taking calls of this nature.’

She told the jury at Travis’s trial: ‘I felt like the BBC had slammed the door in my face.’

Miss Hancock added: ‘The BBC did not want to know when I complained in 2012, whereas the police took my complaint seriously from the start.’
