CNN anchor Zoraida Sambolin revealed on 
Tuesday that she has breast cancer and is getting a double mastectomy - 
as she discussed Angelina Jolie undergoing the same procedure.

Sambolin, 47, who anchors CNN's Early Start, said on the early morning show that - like Jolie - wanting to be there for her two children helped her make the decision.

Sambolin, who is
engaged to White Sox Executive Vice President Kenny Williams, praised 
Jolie as a 'brave woman' for sharing her decision to have the procedure.

'I struggled for weeks trying to figure out how tell you that I had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was leaving to have surgery then Angelina Jolie shares her story of a double mastectomy and gives me strength and an opening,' she wrote on Facebook after the show.

She said that she had been worried about how her nine-year-old daughter, Sophia, would react to the word 'cancer', but said she assured the young girl that she would not lose her hair or become ill, and Sophia was able to digest the information, she said.

She told viewers that she is scheduled to have the surgery on May 28.

'I want to tell women to be vigilant and dedicated to their care,' she added. 'I have been and my prognosis is really good because of that.'

Jolie revealed that she was forced to
make the agonizing decision to have a preventative double mastectomy, 
after tests showed she had an 87 per cent chance of contracting cancer.

Loss: Angelina's mother Marcheline Bertrand died from ovarian cancer at 56. When Angelina discovered her mother's cancer was hereditary, she said that she decided to reduce the risk

She
opened up about her experience in the New York Times, saying that she 
made the decision to undergo the procedure in February after learning 
she is a carrier of the BRCA1 cancer gene.

The 37-year-old's mother Marcheline 
Bertrand died at the age of 56 from ovarian cancer, which Angelina 
revealed she had a high chance of contracting.

Writing
in an editorial piece entitled 'My Medical Choice', Jolie explained her
decision, revealing that she had the initial procedure on February 16 
before having the reconstruction operation on April 20.

The star's surgery was successful and doctors say Angelina's chances of developing breast cancer have now lowered to less than five per cent.

'I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a mastectomy was not easy,' she wrote. 'But it is one I am very happy that I made.'

Angelina praised the support her 
fiancé Brad Pitt and their children, Maddox, 11, Pax, nine, Zahara, 
eight, Shiloh, six, and four-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, gave her 
during treatment.

'It
is reassuring that they see nothing that makes them uncomfortable,' she
wrote. 'They can see my small scars and that’s it. Everything else is 
just Mommy, the same as she always was. And they know that I love them 
and will do anything to be with them as long as I can.

'I
am fortunate to have a partner, Brad Pitt, who is so loving and 
supportive. So to anyone who has a wife or girlfriend going through 
this, know that you are a very important part of the transition.

'We
managed to find moments to laugh together. We knew this was the right 
thing to do for our family and that it would bring us closer. And it 
has.'

Angelina assured that having the 
double mastectomy hasn't changed the way she feels about herself and her
womanliness, and added that results of reconstructive surgery 'can be 
beautiful'.

'On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman,' she said. 'I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.'

And she added that she had wanted to speak out about her experience so that other women could consider their options.

'I am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit from my experience,' she wrote. 'Cancer is still a word that strikes fear into people’s hearts, producing a deep sense of powerlessness.

'But today it is possible to find out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action.'
