Supermarket chain Aldi has launched a brand new budget yoga range just in time for the New Year, including a mat and foam roller for just £6.99 each.

The store claims its new range enables people to experience 'yogic calm' on a budget by snapping up mats, foam rollers and yoga-style clothing at just a fraction of the price they are usually sold at.

The launch comes just a month after the budget chain introduced a skiwear range, which boasted of being able to kit out a family of four for just £160.

From Friday, Aldi's yoga range will be available in all stores and there will also be a series of 'yoga and pilates accessory sets', each costing only £4.99, in a bid to tempt in new shoppers.

The main items from the range, a yoga mat and foam roller, cost just £6.99 each – a bargain compared to prices up to £70 at some dedicated sports retailers.

Aldi is also selling a ladies' yoga jacket for £11.99 and capri pants for £6.99 as part of its 'Specialbuys' offering.

The firm's managing director of buying Tony Baines said: 'It is no secret that our shopper demographic has evolved.

'The past few years have seen a significant shift in perceptions of Aldi customers who are increasingly being attracted to our top quality, great value philosophy.

'Our yoga range is an extension of this - it gives our shoppers the chance to try a new sport this January without spending a fortune.'

It follows the budget supermarket chain's entry into the skiwear market.

The store claimed the bargain-priced range meant a whole family could be kitted out for a ski trip for just £160.

The Ski Pro range features £35 jackets, £30 trousers and a host of accessories with technical gloves priced at just £4.99 and goggles from £7.99. 

Aldi has become increasingly popular with families over recent years, launching ranges which rival upmarket products at low-cost prices.

Earlier this month, a £4.29 Irish Cream Liqueur from the supermarket scooped the top award at an internationally renowned drinks competition, alongside products more than triple its price

The Ballycastle Irish Cream was described by judges as 'everything you'd expect from a cream liqueur – thick, creamy and luscious' at the  prestigious Spirits Business Liqueur Masters 2014 awards.

The supermarket also scooped the 'Consistency in Excellence' trophy; a one-off accolade giving special recognition to Aldi's high quality spirits.

Last month, the supermarket put a bottle of the 'six-rated' white, Hungarian Chateau Pajzos Tokaji Aszu 6 Puttonyos 2008 wine on shelves for just £18.99. 

Ordinarily, a 1993 bottle would be likely to set shoppers back about £185 - and similar quality 2008 dessert wines are sold at an eye-watering £76. 

The move was all part of the budget chain's aim to attract affluent shoppers.

Both Aldi and fellow budget store Lidl have made a concerted effort to attract middle income families with everything from fresh Aberbeen Angus fillet steaks at £5 each to award-winning wine, coffee and cheese.

The move has put mounted on pressure on the big supermarket 'four' – Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda – which are being forced to slash prices to compete with their budget counterparts. 

The Aldi Specialbuys Yoga range, which also includes Kettlebells (from £6.99), Dumbbells (£6.49) will be in store on January 2.
