The semi final between Holland and Argentina was by no means the most exciting game of the World Cup, but Trevor Steven's slip of the tongue somewhat livened up the last-four clash.

The co-commentator, on duty for RTE, got mixed up when trying to say 'penalised' - and instead blurted out the word 'penis'.

It certainly peaked the attention of those finding the match dull, as it ended in a 0-0 stalemate after 120 minutes.

Steven will hope another slip doesn't occur during his co-commentary stints, but got to see Lionel Messi and Argentina book their place in the World Cup final.

Messi took the first penalty of a shootout which Argentina won 4-2 comfortably, as Louis van Gaal's Holland couldn't escape the semi final.

Germany stand in Messi's way of making history on Sunday when the two teams meet at the Maracana.

How do you get through this? Messi ends up passing the ball as he is surrounded by so many Dutch markers

Marked man: Messi has four Dutch defenders surrounding him as he attempts to make a trademark dribble
