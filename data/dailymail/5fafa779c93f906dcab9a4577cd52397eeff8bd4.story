A Good Samaritan has been knocked down and killed after he sprinted across a road to hand back a dropped wallet with £400 inside.

Teacher Li Xiaopeng had run up debts of £6,000 financing his own primary school in Lanqiao, Shaanxi province, western China, and was in dire financial difficulties.

Despite this, the 41-year-old desperately attempted to return the wallet to its owner before he was hit by a vehicle. Friends said it was typical of him to do the decent thing and try to return the money.

Hero: Teacher Li Xiaopeng was knocked down and killed after sprinting across a road to hand back a dropped wallet with £400 inside. He built and ran a school in his village and is pictured with a pupil

Married Xiaopeng, who has a daughter, 7, was regarded as a local hero for all he did for the local community, and now the village is in mourning following his death.

Le Sing, a worker at his kindergarten, said: 'Xiaopeng was such a kind-hearted man. He always put everyone else before himself. He was not a rich man. But he would always find a way of helping people.

'Although he had little money he loved children and wanted them to have the best possible start in life.

'He had been to college and could have done many other things and made more money but he had such a good heart and only wanted to help people. The fact he died doing such a good dead just sums up what a good man he was.

Caring: Mr Xiaopeng built, ran and financed the school himself after setting it up when he left college

'All the workers and the children are very sad about his death.

'But we hope we can do our best to keep the kindergarten open so that other children in the future will benefit from Xiaopeng's generosity. We hope his memory will live on here and encourage the children to be so kind hearted.'

Mr Xiaopeng built, ran and financed the kindergarten himself after setting it up when he left college.

At first it did not run very well and he built up considerable debts, but he never gave up on his education dream for the children in his village.

Le said: 'When it was the holidays he would go and work extra hours so he could earn money for the kindergarten.

'He worked all summer long hours in a coal mine. Every penny he would invest in the kindergarten.'He had only been back from the mine a few days when the tragic accident happened.

'He had already bought new books for the children for the start of term with the money he made from the coal mine work.

'He was so happy he could buy these materials. he was excited to teach the children. We will do our best to help the children learn. Xiaopeng's memory will live on.

'Everyone here is devastated. His wife and daughter are heartbroken.'
