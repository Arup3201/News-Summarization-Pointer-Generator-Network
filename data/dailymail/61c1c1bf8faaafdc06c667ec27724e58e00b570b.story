Independent review? Former home secretary Alan Johnson had 'no appetite' for inspectors to review Scotland Yard's original police phone-hacking investigation

A Labour minister blocked an independent inquiry into Scotland Yard’s phone hacking investigation in 2009, the Leveson Inquiry heard yesterday.

Sir Denis O’Connor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, said he wanted to examine the case because it raised ‘substantial public confidence issues’.

But he told the inquiry that his proposed review ‘never really got off the ground’ because the then Home Secretary Alan Johnson had ‘no appetite’ for it.

The original Met phone hacking investigation, launched in December 2005, resulted in the News of the World’s royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire being jailed for intercepting voicemail messages.

But no action was taken against any other reporters and the inquiry failed to identify hundreds of victims.

Sir Denis said he had a discussion about the report with a Home Office civil servant on the day it appeared in print.

He told the inquiry: 'I said, looking at this, that I thought the revelations merited some form of independent review.

'I thought that the allegations that 
were there, if true in any degree, would raise substantial public 
confidence issues, and I would not be surprised if the HMIC were asked 
to assist in some way to facilitate such an approach...

'I think there was a second - again in the margins of other business - conversation with another, more senior official.

Deaf ears: Sir Denis O'Connor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, said he advised Home Office officials there should be an independent review after the Guardian story

'But my understanding was that, as 
with a number of other options, discussions ensued with ministers and 
the home secretary at the time, and there was no appetite for the HMIC 
being involved.

'So it never really got off the ground, sadly.'

Lord Justice Leveson today indicated he will not simply accept proposals by the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) for reforming the system of newspaper regulation without subjecting them to 'forensic scrutiny'.

PCC chairman Lord Hunt of Wirral said last week that the watchdog would close this year to create a new 'press regulator with teeth'.

Lord Justice Leveson said today: 'From the outset of this inquiry, I have said to editors that the problems of press regulation are theirs and that they should seek to find a solution.

'I have equally emphasised that the solution not only has to work for them but it must also work for me, by which I have explained I mean the public at large.

In January, Lord Hunt proposed that the body which replaces the PCC should have separate divisions for dealing with complaints and enforcing standards - and perhaps a third arm with powers to mediate in disputes with newspapers and award compensation.

Publishers would have to sign up to the new regulator on a five-year rolling contract, he suggested.

Lord Leveson added: 'I repeat that Lord Hunt and the industry must continue to work on what they see as the best way forward - not, I hope, simply viewing the task as one of trying to persuade me to adopt what for them is a "least worst" option - but they must expect that the ultimate suggestion will be subjected to forensic analysis.'

Sir Denis was speaking after Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, the Yard's most senior female officer, told the inquiry that there was no 'culture' of leaks from the police to the media.

She said some officers had been prepared to take money from the press but that it had been carried out by isolated individuals.

'I genuinely believe that the police service that I'm in is less corrupt than it has ever been,' she said.

She also defended her predecessor, John Yates, for ruling out reopening the phone-hacking investigation in 2009, prompting Lord Leveson to brand the decision as 'disastrous'.

ACC Yates was asked by the commissioner to reconsider the original investigation following the revelations printed in the Guardian.

After reviewing the case for eight hours, ACC Yates concluded that ‘no further investigation is required’.

Ms
Dick said though the decision was ‘poor’ it was ‘impossible to 
countenance’ what Mr Yates did was not what ‘he saw as his best and the 
right thing’.

‘The outcome of the decision was not only poor, it was disastrous,’ Lord Leveson responded.

Mr Yates later resigned over his 
handling of the scandal and his alleged links to Neil Wallis, the former
News of the World executive.

Lord Leveson added: ‘It has been 
suggested Mr Yates was very keen to dismiss [the revelations], and that 
might been because of his friendship with Mr Wallis.

‘It might also be possible he adopted
a rather too dismissive a line for reasons which do not bear on his 
integrity but demonstrate a lack of judgement.’

Asked what she would have done in the
same situation, she said: ‘If I had been asked to do this piece of work
and I knew somebody as well as it now appears he knew, [I would ask]… 
do I have any conflict?

‘And if you do think you have any 
conflict you have to discuss that with the boss, and that's what I would
have done - at a minimum a conflict like that should be discussed.’

She
earlier told the inquiry how she had to bat down Boris Johnson's deputy
when he kept questioning the resources devoted to the force's new 
phone-hacking investigation.

She
said she reminded Kit Malthouse that it was for her to make the 
decision, not him, because British police are operationally independent.

Former Metropolitan Police 
commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson told the inquiry last week that the 
deputy London Mayor complained about the level of resources allocated to
the investigation because of a political and media-driven 'level of 
hysteria'.

Ms Dick said Mr 
Malthouse, then-chairman of Scotland Yard's former governing body the 
Metropolitan Police Authority, voiced his concerns to her after Scotland
Yard launched a new phone-hacking probe in January 2011.

She
told the inquiry: ‘On a couple of occasions Mr Malthouse, I thought 
jokingly, said to me, “I hope you're not putting too much resources into
this, Cressida”.

‘On the third occasion when he said 
it again, I said, "well, that's my decision and not yours, and that's 
why I'm operationally independent".

‘We then went on to have a perfectly reasonable sort of conversation about where the public interest lay.’

Ms Dick said she wanted to ‘put down a
marker’ for Mr Malthouse so that he and the police investigation were 
not compromised if it was ever suggested that officers had bowed to 
political pressure.

The Inquiry also heard that Ms Dick 
did not discuss the progress of her investigation into the racist murder
of teenager Stephen Lawrence at meetings of the Met's top officers 
because of fears about leaks.

She
said she restricted briefings to 'people who really needed to know' and
did not discuss the case at Scotland Yard's management board to 
minimise the risk of unauthorised information being reported in the 
media.

Ms Dick said: 'This was an investigation which over the years had been obviously very important to the public and to the Met.

Innocent: ACC Dick led the bungled operation that led to the killing of Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005

'But in the 1990s one of the things that had been difficult about it as an investigation had been unauthorised disclosure of information...

'I took the decision when I took this on that as soon as we started our forensic review in 2005-06, I would personally only brief the commissioner, and only intermittently, on the progress of that review.

'Because I was absolutely determined, if I could possibly ensure it, that only those people who really needed to know did know in case there was any unhelpful media coverage which might undermine the investigation or any future trial in terms of people's right to a fair trial.'

Ms Dick also described how journalists had waited outside her house 
after Brazilian de Menezes was shot dead by police after he
was mistaken for a suicide bomber the day after failed attacks on 
London in July 2005.

It was his killing that brought Ms Dick into the public eye. Officers under her 'tactical delivery' command mistakenly identified him as one of five wouldbe suicide bombers wanted for an attack on the London transport network in July 2005.

Mr de Menezes was tailed to Stockwell tube station in South London, followed on to a tube train  -  and shot seven times in the head in front of horrified passengers.

It later emerged that Ms Dick, 49, oversaw a 'noisy and quite chaotic' control room.

While the inquest jury said she should be absolved of any personal culpability, the Independent Police Complaints Commission criticised her for not making it explicitly clear to her officers that when she ordered Mr de Menezes to be 'stopped' she did not intend for him to be shot.

'I have no complaint about scrutiny received, I expected it 
and was not surprised by any of it. Senior public officials have to 
expect a great deal of attention,' she said.
