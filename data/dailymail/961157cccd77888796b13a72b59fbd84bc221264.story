A super slimmer who shed four dress sizes after being dumped by boyfriends for being too fat has finally found love - just in time for Valentine's Day.

Marie Mace, 30, said her relationships never lasted long because of her wobbly waistline.

After deciding she couldn't face another Valentine's Day alone, she ditched the junk food and embarked on a strict diet and exercise regime.

Marie Mace was determined to lose weight after she was treated poorly by several ex boyfriends. She now wears size 12 jeans, down from a size 20

She found that once the pounds started melting away, old boyfriends begged her to take them back.But newly svelte Marie snubbed her shallow ex-partners and has now found love with Jamie, 32.

The loved-up couple met on an internet dating site and have booked a romantic holiday to Singapore for next month. 

Ms Mace, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, said: 'I've always been a big girl, and although I tried not to admit it to myself, I knew that my size was ruining my life.

'Boyfriends never stayed interested for long - and deep down, I knew when they split with me it was because of my size. One long term boyfriend had an affair, and I know my weight played a part in it.

'One ex even told me that he wouldn't take me out to restaurants or bars because he was too ashamed to be seen with me, so we had to stay in my house. I knew I couldn't carry on like I was.'

The income advisor suffers from Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, and so gains weight easily while finding it difficult to lose.

She was advised to lose weight by her doctor after tipping the scales at 16st 1lb.

'I always avoided scales, so when my doctor told me how much I weighed I was shocked and embarrassed,' Ms Mace said.

She signed up to a short-term low-calorie diet plan, that included shakes, soups, bars and porridge.

Ms Mace signed up to the Cambridge plan last June, and by October she had shed three and a half stone - and replaced her size 20 jeans with slinky size 12 dresses.

She said: 'It was tough going to start with, but in the first week I lost eight pounds - and from then on I was hooked.'

Polycystic ovary syndrome affects millions of women in the UK.

Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless cysts that are 
no bigger than 8mm each. Normal ovaries have only about half this number
of cysts.

The cysts are under-developed follicles which contain eggs that 
haven't developed properly. Often in PCOS, these follicles are unable to
release an egg, meaning ovulation doesn't take place.

Symptoms include problems getting pregnant, irregular periods, weight gain, acne and excessive body hair.

The exact cause is unknown but it can run in families. Overweight women are at greater risk of developing PCOS, which could be because they produce higher than average levels of insulin.

Some women with PCOS do go on to have children.

Marie has managed to maintain her weight loss for six months since coming off the plan and has since found love.

She said: 'After losing the weight, 
ex partners started coming crawling out of the woodwork - but I didn't 
want to have anything to do with them. If they weren't interested when I
was fat, they definitely don't deserve me when I'm slim.'

She said one former boyfriend wanted to start dating again after seeing new pictures of her on Facebook, despite the fact he was already dating someone else. It made her realise she deserved something better.

'I met Jamie in December, and we just
clicked straight away. It feels great to be in a happy relationship 
with someone who loves me for me,' she said.

She added: 'My polycystic ovary syndrome always made me doubt I would be able to have children, as that was what was advised by my doctor.

'However, since I've lost the weight, my body is functioning naturally now, giving me hope that I may be able to conceive naturally when the time is right.

'I am now looking forward to the future and thankfully the past is staying where it is, in the past.'
