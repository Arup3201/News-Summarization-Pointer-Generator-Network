A police chief who accidentally shot his wife as she slept in their Atlanta home early on New Year's Day has been married four previous times, an investigation has revealed.

William McCollom, the chief of police in Peachtree City, told authorities that his gun accidentally went off as he moved it in the night and now agents from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and a local prosecutor are conducting a criminal probe and examining his career.

His wife, Margaret McCollom, whom he had previously divorced, is paralyzed from the waist down following the incident, WSBTV reported. She was released from Atlanta Medical Center earlier this week.

She told investigators she cannot shed light on the incident because she was sleeping but that she believes it was an accident. 

Investigation: Peachtree City Chief of Police William McCollom, pictured left, dialed 911 to report accidentally shooting his wife Margaret, right, as she slept in their suburban Atlanta home early New Year's Day

Records show that her husband waited nearly two minutes into the 911 call to mention where he worked. 

'You're the chief of police in Peachtree City?' the dispatcher repeated.

'Yeah, unfortunately, yes,' he responded.

As soon as the bullet struck his wife, McCollom's personal life and three-decade history in law enforcement were bound for intense scrutiny. As the investigation into his past commences, he also faces an internal inquiry that could result in discipline.

McCollom has gone through four divorces, including one from Margaret McCollom. It's unclear whether William and Margaret McCollom ever remarried, though investigators refer to them as husband and wife.

None of McCollom's divorce filings indicate he had ever been violent. He married two of the women in Wyoming, where they remain, and had three children with one.

Ex-wife: His fourth wife, Suzanne Carter, divorced McCollom last year, claiming he'd cheated on her

His fourth wife, previously named by DailyMail.com as Suzanne Carter, is a rabbi who was the police department chaplain in Delray Beach, Florida when McCollo, was chief there.

They married in 2002 and divorced in 2014 after she claims he cheated on her, which he denied. 

On the professional front, hundreds of pages of records from his personnel files contain no evidence of criminality, major misconduct or recklessness for the former firearms instructor who once trained a SWAT team on combat shooting.

'Everybody's scratching their head,' said Michael Couzzo Jr., the village manager who hired McCollom as the police chief in Tequesta, Florida, in 2006. 'They're scratching their heads saying, "How could this have happened?"'

Investigators have not publicly speculated on what led up to the shooting.

Only a few details are known. McCollom called 911 around 4:17 a.m. and told a dispatcher his handgun fired as he moved it. McCollom also said he and his wife were sleeping.

He told the 911 dispatcher that he had shot his wife, a former emergency-room nurse, twice with his police-issued Glock 9 mm handgun. But it was later determined that she had only been hit once.

Mrs McCollom told investigators she was sleeping when shot and couldn't offer more information. The wife said she thought the shooting was an accident, GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang said.

If investigators deem the shooting an accident, a police officer might avoid criminal charges and could potentially keep his job, said Robert Verry, a longtime internal affairs investigator in New Jersey and policing instructor. He is not involved in the probe. 

Scene: He told the 911 dispatcher he had shot his wife as she slept while he moved his gun just after 4am on January 1. His wife told investigators that she believes it was accidental

Recovering: His wife Margaret, pictured right, is said to now be paralyzed from the waist down

'It's so premature it's tough to tell,' Verry said. 'The devil's in the details.'

Born in northeast Wyoming, McCollom, 57, briefly served as a reserve deputy in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in late 1982, according to his resume. County officials could not immediately determine whether employment records from that period still exist.

McCollom twice married women in Wyoming, including his second wife, with whom he had three children. Both of those marriages ended in divorce.

He found a job in 1983 as a police officer in Delray Beach, Florida, where he worked for 23 years. He rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the assistant chief.

'His tactics were safe,' said Delray Beach Police Lt. Vinnie Gray, a union representative who served on the SWAT team with McCollom. 'It was a shock to see what happened' in Georgia.

In 1988, as McCollom's career accelerated, he wed Margaret. They divorced 11 years later.

The FBI investigated McCollom around 1993 over an allegation he knocked out the front teeth of a suspect arrested for battery on a police officer, McCollom said in a job application.

Old booking photos showed the accuser did not have teeth prior to the arrest. McCollom said the booking photo from the arrest in question did not show any injuries.

'The facts and independent witness testimony proved the subject was lying and the investigation exonerated me after my initial interview,' McCollom wrote. 

Good record: McCollom ,who has been married four times, first worked for the Delray Beach, Florida police force, where he worked for 23 years and eventually became the assistant chief

McCollom was disciplined once in 2005 after being accused of ordering a subordinate to request free hotel rooms for deputy sheriffs, according to his internal affairs file. Delray Beach Police Chief Larry Schroeder, who counseled McCollom over it, did not return messages seeking comment.

McCollom got hired as chief of the small department in Tequesta in 2006, but life drew him back to Wyoming. In early 2010, McCollom sought unpaid leave, telling colleagues he needed to care for an ailing sister and help a family construction business.

'I have an opportunity to enter the private sector as an independent contractor and have decided it is now or never,' McCollom wrote in a resignation letter.

His fourth wife filed for divorce in March 2011. Around that time, his former wife, Margaret, rejoined him in Wyoming, said the chief's sister, Barbara Sutherland.

Sutherland said she believed the couple remarried after he took the police chief's job in Georgia.

'The second time around, they grew up, they figured it out,' she said.
