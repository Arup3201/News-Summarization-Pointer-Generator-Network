Fashion chain Next has taken a baby grow off its shelves after customers noticed it was covered in penis drawings.

Shane Gallivan, 23, was feeding his 10-month-old twin daughters Evelyn and Amelia at home in Bulwell, Nottingham, when he spotted an unusual shape in their baby grows' 'washing line' design.

After looking closer, he uncovered what he believes is the drawing of a penis in the image of a green jumper.

He then examined the rest of his daughters' baby grows and found lots of different penis images covering their arms, legs and bodies.

Today, Mr Gallivan's wife Carla, 24, said her husband's discovery had left them feeling 'angry'.

'He was feeding my daughter when he suddenly said "oh my god",' said the insurance worker. 'He looked at the baby grow and noticed the trousers were covered in penises. 

'At first I thought it must just be a mistake, but I looked and there are lots of different ones all over it.

'It just looks like the designer was having a laugh and no one spotted it. I was angry because it's not the kind of thing you should be dressing a baby in.'

Next, which stocks hundreds of baby clothes, later admitted the drawing of a jumper had ended up looking like a penis because of a misprint.

Mr and Mrs Gallivan had been given a packet of the baby grows as a present four months ago, but had only recently noticed the design flaw.

They are now refusing to dress their twin daughters in them.

'We aren't going to keep it and keep dressing the girls in it,' said Mrs Gallivan. 'I think what makes it all worse is that I have dressed two girls in it, not just that I put it on a baby.

'The girls were wearing it for weeks before we noticed. We don't tend to look in depth at the clothes. 

'We just thought it was a cute, nice baby grow with washing line with clothes and socks on it, but then we saw this. Once you notice it, it is unmistakeable.'

A spokesman for Next said the offending design was pulled from shelves after they received another complaint about the item.

In a statement, the store said: 'We were shocked by the image that ended up on one of our sleepsuits.

'The offending part of the design started life as an upside down jumper with a neck binding and placket with buttons (hanging on the washing line), but unfortunately has been over simplified by the printer and has unintentionally become something else.

'This is an innocent mistake that had not been picked up in the approval process. As it was inappropriate we made the decision to withdraw this item from sale as soon as it was bought to our attention earlier this year.'
