A 20-year-old Minnesota college student has died from hypothermia after she collapsed on the way home to her dorm after a night out drinking.

Bemidji State University junior Sandra Lommen was found unconscious but breathing at 8.30am on Wednesday morning in a wooded area of Bemidji showing signs of intoxication and hypothermia.

She was rushed to hospital but never regained consciousness and police believe she wandered off the road and fell through the ice that had frozen over the creek.

Tragic: Sandra Lommen was found barely conscious on Wednesday morning after trying to walk home from a party two miles from her dorm

Tragically, police in Bemidji said they believe she managed to get herself out of the creek, but succumbed to the cold afterwards, passed out and was pronounced dead at Sanford Medical Center.

Police also announced that a criminal investigation has been launched because Lommen was believed to be drunk and was under 21.

The popular freshman was enrolled in nursing school and police are keen to talk to whoever was at the party she attended on Tuesday night.

The student lived less than two miles from where she was found in the woods and was 'dressed appropriately for what she had intended to do, which was walk home,” said Police Chief Mike Mastin.

On being transported to hospital, Mastin said he detected an odour of alcohol on her breath.

Addressing the media, he said this just shows young people that 'you need to take care of youself' while drinking and walking home in the cold.

'There is a family that just lost their 20-year-old daughter, and that’s just huge,' he said according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'The parents were up here last night, and I met with them. It’s so very hard on them.

'I have two daughters myself. It’s tough.'

In a tragic last Twitter post, Lommen posted this message, 'Make life fun, tomorrow isn't guaranteed.'

On Wednesday evening, BSU President Richard Hanson released a statement to the campus community about Lommen’s death.

“I offer my deepest condolences to Sandra’s family and to all those in our community who knew and cared for her,” Hanson said.
