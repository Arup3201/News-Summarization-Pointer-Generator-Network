Comedian Freddie Starr today said accusations he tried to grope a 14-year-old girl at a Jimmy Savile sex party 40 years ago are killing him.

The 69-year-old madcap comic says he wants 'I told you I was innocent' carved into his tombstone as he fears he could have a massive heart attack and die because of the stress.

‘I have never groped a woman in my life,’ he told ITV's This Morning, and was visibly shaking when he said he was going to hospital after the interview because he was suffering from heart palpitations.

Protest: Freddie Starr used a TV interview to say he had 'never groped a woman in my life' and wanted to speak to police

Denial: The comic was joined by his fiancée Sophie Lea, 34, who described him as a 'gentleman'

Starr: He told Holly Willoughby And Phillip Schofield that he still could not remember being on the show with Savile

Starr had denied meeting his accuser Karin Ward but a video later emerged of the pair of them together on Savile’s show ‘Clunk Click’.

She claims he tried to grope her in Sir Jimmy's dressing room.

'I've done hundreds of thousands of shows on television - I couldn't recall doing it,' he said today.

'I've got to go to hospital later today as I've had palpitations on my heart.

'If I do have a heart attack and die it will say "I told you I was innocent".

'I would never, ever, ever touch an underage girl.'

His fiancée Sophie Lea, 34, sat by him throughout the interview and also defended him.

'The sad thing is that we live in Great Britain and in Great Britain you are innocent until proven guilty. We have not heard from the police and he is being tried by the press.

'Those who know Freddie will know this is not true.

'You get people saying, "oh he's got a younger partner, it must be true", but it doesn't mean anything.

'Regardless of our age difference, we were consenting adults when we met one another.

'It should make no difference that Freddie's with a younger fiancee, or there's any age difference. It does not mean that these allegations have any truth behind them whatsoever.'

Starr also used the interview to slam Jimmy Savile, who is accused of abusing at least 30 children.

‘I think he has 
abused his position. Despicable. There’s no words to say about that, 
what the man has done, how he has conducted himself. It’s disgusting,’ 
Mr Starr said.

The comedian was named by Miss Ward first by BBC’s Newsnight reporters last year for a report which was shelved.

Allegations: The 69-year-old funnyman was first named by Karin Ward (pictured) when she spoke to the BBC's Newsnight reporters last year for a report which was never broadcast

Last
week she told ITV News: 'I was horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie
Starr, who had a very bad attack of wandering hands and had groped me, 
and I didn’t like him because he smelled like my step-father and it 
frightened me and freaked me out, and I rebuffed him.'

The 1974 footage showing Starr and Miss Ward was unearthed by Channel 4 News.

It showed Starr appearing on Clunk Click – the very episode Miss Ward says was 
being filmed the day she was abused.

Standing next to him was a 14-year-old Miss Ward, in a yellow blouse and long brown hair.

Miss Ward – who also claimed to have 
seen paedophile pop star Gary Glitter raping a 13-year-old girl in 
Savile’s dressing room on a different occasion – was a pupil at the 
now-defunct Duncroft School for girls.

Upset: Freddie Starr at the ITV studios, which he left to go to hospital to have his heart checked

Stressed: Starr holds a cigarette and spoke about his fears that he may die from a heart attack

Savile used to prey on under-age girls at the school and invited his favourites to London to watch his shows being recorded.

Starr has not been contacted by police about her allegations.

'I have not been contacted by the police. I want to be interviewed by them. I want it very badly.

'She should have gone to the police with her complaint, not to the press.'

Starr - who suffered a massive heart 
attack in April 2010 which left him needing quadruple heart bypass 
surgery - last week failed to ban ITV from airing Miss Ward’s 
allegations.

'My lawyer advised me to get one to give us a bit of space, to clear our thoughts and look at our evidence.'

Denial: Freddie Starr, pictured today after his ITV appearance, insists he 'never groped anyone in my life'

Standing by him: Sophie Lea says she believes her fiance Freddie Starr is innocent of any wrong-doing

Upset: Freddie Starr and fiancee Sophie Lea both refute the allegations against him

Concern: The couple claim the recent allegations have caused Freddie Starr to suffer health problems
