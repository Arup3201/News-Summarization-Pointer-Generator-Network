A rail union boss was thrown off a live radio programme after making an offensive rant at the show’s presenter.

Steve Hedley, assistant general secretary of the RMT, repeatedly asked Nick Ferrari: ‘Have you stopped beating your wife?’

The LBC radio host had been quizzing Mr Hedley about a Tube strike in support of a driver sacked for failing two alcohol breath tests. The exchange began when Mr Ferrari asked: ‘Why are you supporting a drunk driver?’

On-air row: Broadcaster Nick Ferrari was forced to cut off union leader Steve Hedley today after he ranted about a Tube strike and asked the LBC presenter: 'Have you stopped beating your wife?'

As Mr Ferrari pressed for an answer, an increasingly irate Mr Hedley replied with the wife-beating remark. When Mr Ferrari protested that he was a divorced man, Mr Hedley asked if he’d stopped beating his ex-wife. The mock question about domestic violence is often used to flag up a question that condemns the person who answers it no matter what reply is given.

Mr Hedley said he was making a point about being asked for a straight yes or no answer in a complex situation. There is no suggestion that Mr Ferrari ever beat his wife.

Mr Hedley was speaking in support of Alex McGuigan who allegedly failed the breath tests before starting work on the Northern Line. ‘He wasn’t drinking at work and he wasn’t drunk,’ he said, insisting that the driver’s diabetes could have led to a false reading.

But when the union chief kept asking the same question about wife-beating, Mr Ferrari took him off air. Mr Ferrari calmly told him: ‘Goodbye Mr Hedley. I just find that offensive. You had really interesting points to make there.

‘Clearly you are unhappy with the test. Clearly, it may have been poorly administered. Your colleague, I think, appears to have diabetes. If he does and that’s why he failed his test, I will be there to support him.’

But he added: ‘Your vile and abusive stance means I never wish to speak to you again. You have diminished the case of your colleague immeasurably.’ Mr Hedley, from East Ham, east London, is one of the union movement’s most controversial characters and has caused offence with Facebook posts.

One, which emerged during his failed attempt to succeed Bob Crow as RMT chief, showed him in a Soviet-style military hat with an assault rifle in his hand.

His Facebook page contains status updates glorifying Tube strikes, with one post reading: ‘It’s taken me three hours to drive eight miles: mission accomplished, gridlock achieved, victory to the RMT.’

Mick Cash won the race to lead the RMT in the election for general secretary last autumn.

Announcing the strike action in London on Tuesday he said: ‘Our members have voted for industrial action and the union will now consult extensively with our representatives before deciding on our next moves in this dispute.’ London Underground had urged union members to vote against strikes.

Spokesman Nigel Holness said: ‘Strike threats will not alter our commitment to safety, nor will they make us consider reinstating a driver who failed two alcohol breath tests.

‘We operate a zero tolerance approach towards the consumption of alcohol in order to keep customers and staff safe. You wouldn’t let someone who had been drinking alcohol drive your family in a car, and we don’t let people who have been drinking alcohol drive people’s families in Tube trains.’

Mr Ferrari told the Daily Mail last night he was considering legal action. However, he added: ‘I would have to balance the fact that I would ultimately be taking money from a union that staffs a vital public service industry.’ 

Mr Hedley said that Mr Guigan has diabetes, which produced a 'false result', but when asked if the driver had failed an alcohol test he became irate. London Underground said that the tests take this into account.

He kept asking Mr Ferrari, a divorcee who has never attacked his ex-wife: 'Have you stopped beating your wife?' - a well known loaded question used in debates about presumed guilt.

The interview then descended into chaos before the union boss was cut-off.

Mr Ferrari said: 'Goodbye Mr Hedley. I just find that offensive. I have tried time and time again. I have to take it that your colleague failed.

'You had really interesting points to make there. Clearly you are unhappy with the test. Clearly, it may have been poorly administered. Your colleague, I think, appears to have diabetes. If he is that and that's why he failed his test, I will be there to support him.'

Messages: Mr Hedley praised 'comrades' and celebrated disruption after a precious Tube strike

He added: 'But your vile and abusive stance means I never wish to speak to you again. And in my eyes, you have diminished the case of your colleague immeasurably.

'As an assistant general secretary, you need some form of media training. Goodbye.'

Mr Hedley is one of the trade union movement's most controversial characters, causing a offence with a series of Facebook posts. 

One showed him in a Soviet-style miltary hat and an assault rifle in his hand and emerged as he ran to replace Bob Crow.

His Facebook page is filled with status updates glorifying Tube strikes, with one post reading: 'It's taken me three hours to drive eight miles: mission accomplished, gridlock achieved, victory to the RMT.'

Another post exhorts his 2,000-plus friends not to cross the picket line in a Tube strike, saying: 'If you are on our side then respect our picket lines, if you are on the Government's side you will cross the pickets and be remembered as the 21st century UDM scabs and class traitors.

'Support yourself by supporting the RMT strike.  DON'T CROSS PICKET LINES.'

And yet another post, which he later took down, read: 'With three different strikes announced today, I think I'll enjoy the Easter weekend.'

Friends: Mr Hendley salutes with his comrade Bob Crow, who died suddenly last year

Further posts glorify striking RMT members, while another attacked 'Dave' [sic] Miliband, saying: 'Wake up and smell the coffee, the Labour Party is well and truly over.  Vote TUSC and build a workers' party.'

Millions of commuters face potential travel chaos after Tube drivers voted to strike in support of a colleague who was sacked after being found over the drink drive limit twice.

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) last night voted by 299 votes to 221 to strike in support of an unnamed driver who failed two random breathalyser tests befopre going on duty.

Although it is unclear when the strike will take place, it is likely to cause major disruption for many of London Underground’s four million daily commuters.

The union argued that the type of breathalyser used did not account for people with diabetes. But London Underground (LU) said the breath tests were not affected by the condition.

And in another post, later taken down, Mr Hedley, who is from East Ham, in east London, wrote: 'I've had to move down the carriage to escape a load of middle-class prats and their mockney accents.

'Posh people really shouldn't deliberately drop their H's in an attempt to pretend they are something they clearly are not.'

After the former Israeli leader Ariel Sharon died, Mr Hedley wrote: 'Thatcher will have company in hell tonight as another war criminal snuffs it'.

Meanwhile photographs on his Facebook page support the image of him as a hard-left politician.

One picture shows him and Mr Crow grinning at the camera, with Mr Hedley raising his clenched fist in the universal symbol of industrial workers, while another shows him smirking in front of the Kremlin.

Mick Cash eventually won the race to lead the RMT after the election last autumn.
