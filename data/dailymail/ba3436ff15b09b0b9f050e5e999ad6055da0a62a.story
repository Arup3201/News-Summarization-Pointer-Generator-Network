Incredible scenes unfolded last night during a televised Italian football match when a manager physically attacked his own player after he substituted him.

The incident occurred during a Serie A match between Fiorentina and Novara.

Just after the half-way mark, Fiorentina manager Delio Rossi substituted midfielder Adem Ljajic, who responded by sarcastically applauding the decision.

Lashing out: Rossi jumps into the dugout and attacks Ljajic, with his assistants desperately trying to restrain him

At first Rossi reprimands him, 
angrily pointing his finger at the player. But when Ljajic sits down 
Rossi jumps into the dugout with him and appears to slap him in the 
face.

Just as Rossi appeared to line up a punch, the coach was pulled away by his assistants and other players.

After deciding to fire the manager, 
Fiorentina president Andrea Della Valle said: 'In a few seconds months 
of stress came out. I am sorry because the coach has never committed 
acts of this kind.

'For his own good to make him 
understand he has made a mistake I had to take this decision. No 
provocation justifies this reaction.'

Della Valle also revealed Ljajic would
also face action for his part in the incident. But he said he would 
wait to announce who would take charge of the side for the rest of the 
season.

'Also for respect of the person with 
whom I believed in to reconstruct Fiorentina I will say nothing official
until tomorrow,' he added. 'Then you will know who will be given the 
reins of the team.

'We will also take proportionate measures against Ljajic.

'Rossi has not justified it to me but he is someone who has never done anything like this.

'I am sorry also that in the 10th year
of my reign and with what he has brought - we have won at Milan and 
Roma and I believed this evening we would have achieved safety, 
certainly not that I would have to take a decision like this.'

When the stunning scene occurred Fiorentina were losing 2-0, but managed to battle back to draw 2-2 despite the distraction.

The result means that the club should 
remain in the top flight of Italian football as they are six points 
clear of the relegation zone with just two games remaining.

Della Valle said he wants to see more of that kind of spirit as they look to recover from the shock of Rossi's departure.

He added: â€˜This team needs unity to 
get away from the relegation situation. I know now that Delio Rossi is 
suffering more than anyone. But I want to respect the work he has done 
until now.'
