Tony Blair has revealed he would like to be Prime Minister again.

The former Labour premier, who left Downing Street in 2007, said he would now do a better job than during his ten years in power because of what he has learned since leaving frontline politics.

Mr Blair has already confessed that he would like another big job, such as the Presidency of the European Council.

But this is the first time he has confessed he would like to return to No10.

Mr Blair, now 59, admitted his 
prospects of a comeback – which would be the first since Harold Wilson 
reclaimed Downing Street in 1974 after losing a general election in 1970
 – were ‘not very likely’.

But his determination to return to the
 political fray is a headache for Labour leader Ed Miliband, who will be
 concerned that he will be overshadowed by Mr Blair.

In an interview with the London 
Evening Standard: ‘I am seeing a lot of the world and I have learned an 
immense amount in the past five years.

‘One of my regrets is that what I have learned in the last five years would have been so useful to me [as Prime Minister].

Because when you see how the world is 
developing you get a far clearer picture of some of the issues our 
country is grappling with.’

Asked directly if he would do the job again, he said: ‘Yes, sure, but it’s not likely to happen is it.’

Mr Blair also said Gordon Brown had 
condemned Labour to defeat by ditching the New Labour policies that got 
him elected three times.

He accused Mr Brown of having him 
‘forced out’ of power, saying he would have liked to have stayed in the 
job but left to avoid a ‘bloody battle’ with Mr Brown’s supporters.

Looking back to the day of his resignation, he said: 'I didn’t want to go but I felt that I had to.

'The only choice would have been to have fought a very bloody battle internally which I thought would damage the country as well as the party.'

Mr Blair suggested that in some ways he is better equipped now to be PM than he was during his time in Downing Street.

'I have learned an immense amount in the past five years,' he said.

'One of my regrets is that what I have learned in the last five years would have been so useful to me (as prime minister).

'Because when you see how the world is developing you get a far clearer picture of some of the issues our country is grappling with.'

Mr Blair said that it was 'inevitable' that Labour would go down to defeat in the 2010 general election after it became clear that, under his successor Gordon Brown, it did not know whether or not it wanted to stick to the New Labour agenda he had mapped out.

He predicted that the Liberal Democrats will struggle at the next election, scheduled for 2015, and urged Mr Miliband to stick to the centre ground.

'My advice to the Labour Party is to sort ourselves out with a strong modern policy,' said Mr Blair. 'Frankly you can’t tell what will happen, if there will be a coalition or not, but I suspect it will be far more of a two-party fight next time.

'Ed Miliband has made a conscious decision that he is going to keep the Labour Party in the centre, and that is sensible.'

Despite the upheavals caused by the financial crash of 2008 - which he admits he did not foresee - Mr Blair said Labour would be wrong to shift to the left.

'My view is that you still in order to win from the Labour perspective have to have a strong alliance with business as well as the unions.

'You have got to be very much in the centre ground on things like public sector reform,” Mr Blair said.

'But I understand that some people think the financial crisis has altered everything. And the mood is against this - personally I don’t think that’s correct.'
