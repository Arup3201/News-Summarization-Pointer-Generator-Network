Office politics can be difficult in any workplace, but imagine if the office in question is in the Houses of Parliament.

Labour frontbencher Liz Kendall has laid bare her frustration after her packed lunch was stolen in a major breach of communal fridge etiquette.

Angered by the thief, she stuck a hilarious hand written note on the fridge door warning people of the threat posed by the lunchbox burglar.

Lunch warning: Labour MP Liz Kendall posted this note after her food was stolen

But it seems the offender is unrepentant, with a Post-It note threatening to do it again.

Ms
Kendall, who was elected MP for Leicester West in 2010, was astonished 
to find her food had disappeared from a fridge shared by dozens of 
people in Portcullis House, where most MPs have their offices.

The shadow minister for care and 
older people wrote a handwritten note admonishing the culprit and 
warning others to think twice before leaving their snack unattended.

Cold war: The row on the fridge door escalated when a note appeared threatening to strike again, but Ms Kendall denied being responsible for the 'sick individual' riposte

‘Someone has stolen my lunch from this fridge,’ Ms Kendall wrote.

Ms Kendall was born in Watford, Hertfordshire

She was elected as the Labour MP for Leicester West in May 2010. Before that she headed a charity called the Maternity Alliance.

She is also a member of Labour’s frontbench team, attending the Shadow Cabinet as the Shadow Minister for Care and Older People.

In 2010 she apologised for taking a photograph and posting it on Twitter during the State Opening of Parliament, which is against regulations.

‘I do not appreciate this and warn other people don’t leave anything in here unless you’re happy for it to go missing. Liz Kendall, Room 219.’

But today a riposte appeared on a bright yellow sticky note: ‘I took it… AND I’D DO IT AGAIN.’

Later a third message was added, reading: ‘YOU ARE A VERY SICK INDIVIDUAL’.

But today Ms Kendall’s office denied she had added the third note.

The Labour MP is campaigning in the Corby by-election today, but an aide said she planned to use the fridge again.

Elected in 2010, she was quickly promoted to the frontbench by Labour leader Ed Miliband. As shadow
minister for care and older people she attends the shadow cabinet and 
is tipped for a major role in any future Labour government.

Ms Kendall has left her lunch in a fridge in a 
corridor of Portcullis House, the modern suite of offices across the 
road from the House of Parliament

Tonight the MP revealed the stolen lunch was a tuna salad and joked she would try to fill up on breakfast in future.

Ms Kendall wrote on Twitter:  'I'm too busy campaigning to speculate on the identity of the Westminster tuna salad thief.

'But from now on I'll be eating a bigger breakfast.'

Meanwhile, an internet joker updated her Wikipedia entry with the line: 'I ate her lunch today. It was yummy.'
