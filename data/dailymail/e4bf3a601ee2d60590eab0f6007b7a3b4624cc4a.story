Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg are both determined to claim a win in Hungary this weekend that will put them in good spirits heading into Formula One's summer break.

The duo have claimed nine victories from 10 races so far this season, and although Hamilton has a five-to-four edge over Rosberg, it is the latter who has a 14-point lead in the championship.

Hamilton, however, has made the Hungaroring his own since arriving in F1, chalking up four wins in seven attempts, including the last two.

Another triumph on Sunday will make him the most successful driver in the history of the race as he and seven-times champion Michael Schumacher are tied.

Hamilton said: 'This race is always a special one for me, with four poles and four wins from my seven races there so far, including my first victory for Mercedes last season.

'I don't really have any secrets there. I've just been very fortunate over the years, and it's a circuit I really enjoy.

'It's one where you can really attack, which works for an attacking driver like myself, so perhaps it suits my driving style a little bit more than some others.

'I'm looking forward to it, and I'm doing absolutely everything I can to get back on level terms with Nico in the title battle. I can't focus more or work harder than I am doing right now.'

Rosberg, meanwhile, is on a high after his success on home soil in Germany on Sunday.

'To win at Hockenheim was a very, very special day for me,' he said.

'That race and Monaco were the ones I really wanted to win, so to have done that is really awesome.

'But now I'm just looking forward to this next race in Hungary where I'll naturally be aiming for another win to extend my championship lead.'

Motorsport boss Toto Wolff is still due to attend despite sustaining a number of fractures in a cycling accident on Tuesday.

On a team-bonding exercise along the river Danube in Vienna, several members of the F1 team - but not including Hamilton and Rosberg - were involved in the incident.

Wolff received treatment in a local hospital for a fractured wrist - which required a pin - elbow, shoulder and collarbone, whilst executive technical director Paddy Lowe escaped with only cuts and bruises.

A Mercedes spokesperson has confirmed Wolff is in 'good spirits', and will arrive at the Hungaroring at some point over the weekend following a further day or two to recuperate.

Via Twitter, Wolff joked: 'We've decided to leave it to the pros now. Lewis & Nico are better wheel to wheel at 300 km/h than we are at 30 km/h!'

Wolff's wife Susie, currently Williams development driver, via her account added: 'My husband the hero! As we know, boys will be boys... Looks like I am on nurse duty for the next few weeks!'

Susie added a picture of her husband with his right arm in plaster and a sling.
