There was a time when youngsters would be dressed in their Sunday best for a trip to the high street photographer to capture timeless images as they developed from angelic babies to spotty teens.

However, new 3D printing technology means it is now possible to create 'mini-me' models – or shelfies - that can be placed on the mantelpiece or sent to granny.

Scanning booths are being opened in Asda stores that can capture a 3D image of a person in just 12 seconds as the template to create an 8in model made from layers of ceramic powder.

The scanners are so sophisticated that they can capture every detail, down to the hair colour, clothes and even a watch or ring.

Asda believes the new technology could see the advent of a new craze for what it calls a 'shelfie' a miniature model to replace the 'selfie' that people take with their smartphones.

During an initial trial it found customers would be keen to use the system to create 3D models of brides and grooms in their wedding outfits, children in their sports kits with medals, forces personnel going on tour and loved ones spending time apart.

Asda found some liked the idea of capturing them wearing fancy dress, while others wanted a permanent record of them before and after a drastic slimming regime.

The supermarket unveiled the first automatic scanning booth in its store in Trafford, Manchester, yesterday and has plans to introduce them into ten more, assuming customers like the idea.

In fact, it would be possible to create an entire family set of ceramic figures as a permanent record to either sit on a shelf or send to loved ones.

The advent of 3D printing promises to revolutionise lives in the same way as the home computer and internet.

3D printers have already been created for domestic use and are becoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing people to print products they need for the home, ranging from ornaments to doorknobs and even sports shoes.

While the technology is also now being used in medicine to help in facial reconstruction or to build prosthetics to replace limbs, while parts are being modelled for the aircraft and motor industry.

Asda first trialled the creation of 3D models of customers at a store in York, however this involved a wait of around five minutes as a member of staff effectively surveyed their body using a handheld scanned. The new booths can do the job automatically in just 12 seconds.

The scanner takes thousands of pictures of the customer, mapping every contour and picking up the colours of the skin and clothing. Computer software then builds up a 3D image, like jigsaw, of the individual on a screen.

The resulting computer file is sent via the web to an Asda facility in Sheffield where a 3D printer, which measures about 6ft by 3ft and costs around £40,000, builds the model.

Conventional 3D printers work by building up a figure in plastic, layer by layer, through a nozzle that can only produce models in one colour.

This new system creates a model from a box which is filled with a white powdered ceramic. A series of jets fire water or colours at the ceramic which solidifies. It is a similar reaction to putting a blob of water on talcum powder.

When finished an airbrush is used to remove the fine white powder to reveal the model, which is created in all the colours captured during the original scan. The system has six million colours.

Asda's chief merchandising officer, Andrew Moore, said: 'The possibilities with 3D printing are endless and I'm pleased that we're ahead of the game in making this truly transformational technology an everyday reality for our customers.

'We are committed to making the newest and most exciting technology available to our customers.

'We were the first to bring affordable 3D printing to the market and customers were queuing round the block to try it out. Following an overwhelming positive initial reaction from shoppers, the obvious next step was to provide improved innovation that we hope will become a permanent fixture in our stores.'
