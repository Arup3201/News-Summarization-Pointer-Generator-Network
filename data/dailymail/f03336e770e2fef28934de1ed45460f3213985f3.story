‘Why do I drink?’ is a question many students probably ask themselves the morning after a heavy night out.

And now one university has spent £20,000 creating a pub laboratory in a bid to unlock the secrets of people's drinking habits and why they overindulge.

Hidden cameras and microphones will monitor students’ behaviour as they guzzle a free drink - or five.

People who are drunk and anxious are most likely to be emotionally connected to Facebook, according to a 2013 study.

Russell Clayton, from the University of Missouri surveyed more than 225 students about their perceived levels of loneliness, anxiousness, alcohol use and marijuana use.

He found that students who reported higher levels of anxiousness and alcohol use were more emotionally connected to Facebook and to the social connections it facilitates.

Mr Clayton also discovered that students who had higher levels of anxiety and loneliness were more likely to use Facebook as a platform to connect with others.

He added that because alcohol use is generally viewed as normative, or socially acceptable, among college students, increased alcohol use may cause an increase in emotional connectedness to Facebook.

There is a serious side to the study at London South Bank University as the lavish experiment is designed to study consumer behaviour and could ultimately help experts work out a way to encourage people to drink more responsibly.

The 'pub lab' will initially look into how much people choose to drink and how people take more risks as they consume more alcohol.

Volunteers will be given free drinks but there is a catch – some the beer and glasses of wine on offer will be alcohol free but smell of ethanol.

The pub lab looks like the real deal and even has a fruit machine. It is designed to be a realistic setting to investigate the ‘factors that motivate people’s drinking’ as real pubs in the outside world have too many distractions - making findings often inaccurate.

The university said the experiment is ‘relatively low cost’ and is ‘extraordinarily useful’.

Dr Tony Moss, head of psychology at the university told The Evening Standard: ‘A lot of the early work we have been doing isn’t so much interested in the effects of alcohol once people are intoxicated, but trying to understand factors that motivate people to drink in certain ways – particularly how they initiate a night out when they are drinking.’

‘Of course, there are studies we do which involve administering alcohol to people, so that we can see what happens later on,’ he added.

Karis Humphreys, a psychology masters student at the university said that offering free drinks is a successful technique to get other students to help out with a scientific study.

‘We all drink a lot, so you can see the findings in your day-to-day life,’ she said.
