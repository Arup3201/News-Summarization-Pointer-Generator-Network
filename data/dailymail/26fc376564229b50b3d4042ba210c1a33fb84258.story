Women are twice as good as men at making friends for life, says a new study.

With one in three saying their best friend today is a pal they met at school.

Men, in comparison, don’t stay as close with only one in six (16%) saying their best friend is from school.

Men are more likely to find friends later in life, at university or at work.

And while both men and women may have hundreds of Facebook friends, they say they have, on average, just five real friends they’d call 'close'.

A quarter of men and a third of British 
women have used social networks, like Facebook, to re-establish 
childhood friendships, the research by Orangina has revealed.

And though both British men and women’s close friendship groups are of similar size - they both have an average of five friends who they describe as ‘close’ - women’s friendship groups tend to be more long-standing.

The research sadly revealed that friends don’t always last forever with 13% of men and 16% of women admit there is at least one person in their friendship group who they really don’t like.

Men are less likely to maintain friendships from school and most meet their good friends in the workplace

In a majority of cases, best friends only last half your life and as you get older the number of good friends you have slowly decreases leaving you with an average of just three friends by the age of 60.

Adult Brits tend to retain an average of five friendships with people they met at high school, according to the national study with 37% of friendships forming in the workplace.

Orangina spokesman Steven Simpson said: 'Women in Britain clearly find it easier to make lifelong friendships than men, according to our research.

'And though we tend to have up to 100 friends on social networks like Facebook and on our mobile phones, we are far more comfortable with quite small "close" friendship groups of around five people.

'The average Brit can count their real close friends on one hand and it’s sad to see that this figure is likely to drop even further as you get older.'
