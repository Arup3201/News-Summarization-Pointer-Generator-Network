The staggering scale of abuse of the student visa system by immigrants desperate to stay in Britain was revealed yesterday.

Tens of thousands of bogus students faked English language tests to beat UK border controls, the Government admitted.

An
 estimated 48,000 immigrants had exploited the lax system in a 
‘shocking’ scam run by criminal gangs, said Immigration Minister James 
Brokenshire.

Immigration
 minister James Brokenshire said English language tests were being 
cheated to allow foreign students to stay in Britain

He
 revealed there had been ‘systematic cheating’ that allowed foreigners 
who could barely speak a word of English to stay in the country 
illegally, with corrupt invigilators reading out answers or allowing 
gangs of imposters to sit tests so the candidates could be awarded an 
English language certificate.

The National Crime Agency has been called in to assist the investigation and some arrests have already been made.

It is the latest immigration scandal to rock the Home Office.

Last month the Mail revealed migrants who cannot speak English were 
able to buy a certificate saying they had passed a language test.

The document opens the door to British citizenship, allowing them access to a full range of benefits.

Our investigation exposed Learn Pass Succeed, which ran the scam at exam centres licensed by the Home Office.

During our undercover probe, 
the Mail paid £500 for a pass certificate in the English language exam 
for a fake candidate despite him never sitting the test or taking a 
course.

Speaking in the 
Commons yesterday, Mr Brokenshire said immigration officials were 
working with HM Revenue & Customs to identify foreign students who 
are in Britain unlawfully as a result of taking the fake language tests,
 so they can be booted out.

He revealed there had been 'systematic cheating' that allowed foreigners who could barely speak a word of English to stay in the country illegally

In
 one extraordinary case, an overseas university student earned more than
 £20,000 a year despite rules preventing them from working more than 20 
hours a week during term time.

Ministers
 also said there were ‘serious concerns’ surrounding the colleges and 
universities which had allowed the overseas students to enrol on 
courses.

The Home Office was alerted to the student visa scandal only after it was exposed by a BBC Panorama programme in February.

ETS, the major company that sets the exams but does not appoint the invigilators, is now at the centre of a police probe.

In
 a humiliating Commons appearance, Mr Brokenshire said an investigation 
had found more than 29,000 falsified test certificates and another 
19,000 questionable results. But he was forced to admit: ‘It is likely 
that the true totals will be higher.’

He
 added: ‘Evidently this could only happen with considerable collusion by
 the test centres concerned. The Government is not prepared to tolerate 
this abuse.

‘We will not 
hesitate to take firm action against those students, colleges and 
universities  who do not abide by their legal responsibilities, and 
bring those responsible to justice.’

Each
 year, around 100,000 non-EU students get their visas to stay in the UK 
extended. Since 2011 foreign students have had to prove they can speak 
English.

Glyndwr University 
in north-east Wales, has been stripped of its right to admit foreign 
students after up to 350 were identified as having invalid or dubious 
test results.

In addition, 
57 private further education colleges also had licenses for admitting 
foreign students suspended. The University of Bedfordshire and 
University of West London are no longer allowed to recruit overseas 
students pending inquiries.

Mr
 Brokenshire said the ‘worst abuse’ took place at the campuses of London
 universities which were located in other parts of the country. He has 
ordered a separate inquiry by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher 
Education, a university watchdog.

In
 2012, academics expressed concerns that universities were recruiting 
foreign students whose grasp of English is so poor they would ‘struggle 
to scrape a GCSE’. Foreign students were seen as ‘cash cows’ as they 
could be charged up to £20,000 in fees.

Shadow
 immigration minister David Hanson said the scale of the scandal was 
‘truly shocking’. He added: ‘People will be outraged that genuine 
students who can add to our economy are being turned away while bogus 
students prosper under this Government. It is clearly an abuse that 
damages the integrity of the system.’

The
 Tories said Labour had done nothing to tighten up immigration controls 
during its time in power and it had ‘fallen on this Government to 
introduce further stringent measures’.

Ministers have no idea how many sham marriages are conducted in Britain, the Government's borders chief told MPs today.

Sir John Vine, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, said there were likely to be many more fake weddings than the 10,000 estimated by the Home Office.

He told the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee that the problem was 'much more widespread' than ministers admitted.

Former chief constable Sir John Vine told MPs the Home Office did not know how many people were abusing the immigration system by carrying out sham marriages

Sir John said Nigerians, Ghanaians and Pakistanis were most likely to be caught trying to cheat their way past border controls by conducting a fake wedding.

But he added: 'One of the fundamental problems is that the Home Office doesn't really know.

'There's a combination of a lack of intelligence and also of poor management information in order for the Home Office to get a grip on it.'

He was asked whether he thought there were many more sham marriages than officially recorded.

Sir John said: 'I think so.' He added: 'It is a much more widespread issue than the figures suggest.'

He said some couples turned up for their ceremony in casual clothes and stood texting on their mobile phones throughout the service.
