Most canines might make a dog's dinner out of balancing acts, Bella Boo shows astonishing self-control, barely moving a muscle while posing for the camera.

The two-year-old pooch, from La Salle, Illinois, is able to pull off the feat with incredibly zen-like focus.

However the patient pooch is no one trick pony. Having trained her from a young pup, dog lover Victoria Lyons, 14, claims Bella is capable of more than 250 different tricks.
