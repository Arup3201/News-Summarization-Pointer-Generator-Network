The 29-year-old son of former sprinter Linford Christie has appeared in court charged with dealing crack cocaine and heroin with a street value of £1,410 from his council flat.

Liam Linford Oliver-Christie was arrested after police with sniffer dogs raided the ground-floor flat in London's West Kensington last year.

Oliver-Christie indicated a not guilty plea and will appear before a judge next month.

Hammersmith Magistrates' Court today heard Oliver-Christie's London council flat was raided on the afternoon of September 30 last year while he was not at home.

Police, who used a sniffer dog, said they found drugs inside the flat together with 'drugs paraphernalia' and an unspecified white powder on the living room table.

They left a note for Oliver-Christie, who later attended a police station voluntarily with his solicitor. 

He is charged with possessing 14.1 grams of 'crack' cocaine, a Class A drug, with intent to supply.

He is also charged with possessing 7.7 grams of Class A diamorphine (heroin) with intent to supply on the same day.

Oliver-Christie did not enter a plea and the case was sent to Isleworth Crown Court for a prelimiary hearing on February 3.

The 29-year-old's mother had a short relationship with Linford Christie, who won lifelong fame when he won gold for Britain in the 100-metre sprint at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain.

He also picked up gold medals in the World, European and Commonwealth championships, and his British 100-metre record of 9.87 seconds remains unbeaten after two decades.

However, after the relationship ended Oliver-Christie had little contact with his father growing up.

Oliver-Christie was bailed on the condition that he continues to live at his address.
