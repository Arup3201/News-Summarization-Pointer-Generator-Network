Gemma Swift was ridiculed for her teeth when she appeared on the Jeremy Kyle show, so much so that the shows producers paid £10,000 for her to have them fixed 

Jeremy Kyle filmed Gemma having her teeth done and she is said to be appearing in a new episode for a grand unveiling. 

However, there is one person who is not too happy about Gemma's transformation - her love rival, Leona Stoner. 

Leona appeared alongside Gemma on the episode in a segment entitled, 'Stop harassing me just because I'm sleeping with your ex.' 

Gemma, who was dating the 22-year-old's ex-boyfriend, accused Leona of harassment. She also accused her of faking her own baby's death.

Leona told the Mirror that she has since received threatening messages from Gemma which the paper pertain to have seen and she is incredibly angry that she be helped out by the show.

Gemma was teased on the internet for her large teeth with one user parodying the lyrics to 'All About That Bass' to make them about her

Other users also mocked Gemma for her large teeth, however, she has had the last laugh now that she has had all of her dental work done

Leona, who is also from Crawley but currently living in Hove, also told the Crawley News: 'It's a joke. She was sitting there laughing and saying [horrible things] on national TV and Jeremy Kyle didn't say anything to stop her.

'I would like to know why he treated me the way he did and why they have now paid thousands of pounds for her to get some new teeth.' 

A spokesperson for the show told the Mirror: 'Gemma's teeth provoked a strong reaction from viewers and on social media after appearing on the show in January. 

'The programme then arranged for her to have orthodontic work, the results of which will be shown in a future Jeremy Kyle Show.

'We take the welfare of our contributors on the show seriously and spoke to Leona after the show and before and after the broadcast and she did not raise any concerns.'
