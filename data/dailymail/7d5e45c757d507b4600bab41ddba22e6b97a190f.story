Three Russian families have been left devastated after an horrific snowmobile tragedy killed two men and four women in the Italian Dolomites.

In the days before the crash, the tourists were seen sipping Champagne and enjoying their ski-ing holiday.

The six died after a night joyride on unlit black ski-runs on Mount Cermis and  investigators suspect the accident was caused by excessive speed and carelessness.

The families were on holiday from Krasnodar in Russia

'It is clear that the fundamental cause is recklessness and imprudence,' said local fire chief Roberto Marchi.

One teenager lost his mother and 
sister in the tragedy while his father is in hospital with multiple 
injuries after the snowmobile towing a sled smashed through barriers, 
flew through the air shearing the tips off trees, and plunged 300ft down a ravine.

The crash involved two tourist 
families from Krasnodar in southern Russia, and a couple who lived and 
worked in Italy in the tourism industry.

Vyacheslav Yudin, 18, stayed at the 
hotel as his relatives went for dinner on the mountainside. They were 
killed as they returned down the mountain.

His mother Lyudmila, 48, a respected 
teacher, and daughter Yulia, 25, were killed in the horror and father 
Boris, 47, is seriously injured in hospital in Trento.

Vyacheslav was said to be 'devastated' at the deaths.

'I can't imagine how my brother Boris 
will cope with it, he adored his family,' said Mr Yudin's sister 
Svetlana yesterday (SAT). 'His wife and children were the main thing in 
his life.'

Aftermath: All but one of the people killed were tourists from the Russian city of Krasnodar

Tragedy: The snowmobile is understood to have plunged down a steep ski slope after slamming through the fence in the Italian Alps

Recovery: Italian investigators have said they suspect the snowmobile crash may have been caused by the use of 'excessive speed'

She said he had called from his hospital to ask his best friend to  break the shattering news to Russian relatives.

An ambulance was called to his shocked elderly parents Alexander and Natalia, both 75, said Russian reports.

Also killed were Irina Kravchenko, 45,
and her husband Vyacheslav Sleptsov, 52, along with their son Denis, 
16. They had travelled to the Dolomites with the Yudin family.

Both families are believed to be wealthy with smart homes and they took regular foreign holidays.

They come from Krasnodar, which is 
close to the Russian sea-and-ski resort of Sochi, which is due to host 
next year's WInter Olympics.

The sixth fatality was Rafilya 
Pshenichnaya, 52, who lived in Italy with Azat Yagafarov, 58. He is now 
in hospital with multiple injuries.  This Russian couple worked in the 
tourism industry in Italy.

Fatal crash: Two other people were seriously injured in the snowmobile crash, which left two men and four women dead

Accident: The crash occured on a ski slope on Mount Cermis, in northeastern Italy

Alpine rescue: One of the women killed in the snowmobile accident worked in Italy in the tourist industry

Inquiry: Investigators are also looking into the possibility of a mechanical malfunction

Yagafarov was driving  snowmobile when it crashed high on the 4,616 feet mountain, said Italian police.

Blood tests were being taken to establish if he had been drinking.  He faces probable prosecution over the horror.

'According to a preliminary report, 
the accident occurred due to exceeding the speed limit of the snowmobile
on a dangerous part of the mountain,' said Alexei Paramonov, the 
Russian consul-general in Milan.

The investigation will also check whether there was a technical fault.

In 1998, a U.S. Marine jet, flying low
on a training run from a nearby air base, accidentally sliced a ski 
gondola's cable on Mount Cermis, sending the cable car crashing to the 
ground and claiming 20 lives.

Darkness: The crash occurred on an unlit ski slope on Friday night, according to a report on Italian radio

Fatalities: The Russian tourists who died in the snowmobile accident have all been named

Sombre scene: The Russian Consul General in Milan has been in contact with investigators following the crash
