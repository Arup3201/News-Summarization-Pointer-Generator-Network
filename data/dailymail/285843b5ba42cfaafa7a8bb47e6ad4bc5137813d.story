Busted: Elizabeth Segundo McClain, 22, of Austin, was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after the incident on Monday

A Texas woman has brought a terrifying new meaning to the phrase 'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned' when she allegedly ran over his mother with her car following their break-up.

Elizabeth Segundo McClain, 22, of Austin, was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after the incident on Monday.

Ryan Boyd told cops that he had broken up with McClain in September after about three years together, and she had apparently not taken the separation well.

On Monday, Mr Boyd's mother Lori was waiting beside her son's car with a flat tire in front of her home when McClain drove up, according to the Austin-American Statesman.

The mother called the police but as Lori Boyd tried to tell the operator the license number of the vehicle, McClain allegedly put the car in reverse and slammed on the gas pedal, striking her.

McClain then drove forward and ran over the right side of her body, including her foot and arm.

Seconds after leaving his mother in the driveway, she texted Mr Boyd, saying: 'How's life LOL.'

He was not home at the time, and didn't know what the text was about until he heard from his mother's boyfriend, who said that she had been mother had been run over by McClain.

It was the latest in a string of 
trouble that Mr Boyd had been experiencing with his jilted girlfriend since their 
break-up.

McClain was also charged with stalking after cops said she called Mr Boyd 750 times in one day.

KXAN-TV reported that on November 11, McClain called Mr Boyd and threatened to drive her car into his living room, and implied that she was watching him.

He called the police, but McClain was not in the area.

Three days later, as Mr Boyd was driving, she texted him, asking: 'How's your car?'

He stopped to inspect the vehicle and found that someone had dumped sugar in his gas tank.

Mr Boyd said he would change his phone number, but she would somehow find out what he had changed it to and the texts would continue.

Lori Boyd was hospitalized with broken bones, including her right clavicle, wrist, ankle and ribs, and had the skin scraped off the right side of her body.

KXAN reported that a magistrate ordered McClain to wear an ankle monitoring bracelet and adhere to a 10pm curfew.

She must also stay at least 200 yards away from Mr Boyd at all times.
