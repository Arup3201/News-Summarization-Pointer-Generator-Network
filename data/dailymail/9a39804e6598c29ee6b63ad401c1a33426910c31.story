Accused: The alleged victims say Derick Crawford is not the man who attacked them

A man charged with brutally raping two British women in separate attacks on the island of Barbados is innocent - say the victims he is accused of assaulting.

Academic Rachel Turner, 30, and grandmother Diane Davies, 63, say police have ignored their insistence that accused Derick Crawford, 47, is not the man who attacked them in 2010, and claim officers were more concerned with protecting the tourism industry in Barbados than with finding the real culprit.

Both women have waived their automatic right to anonymity in order to make their objections public, over fears the same fate will befall other tourists visiting the island.

University researcher Dr Turner will be watching from the public gallery when local man Crawford appears at a preliminary hearing at a Barbados magistrates' court tomorrow.

Retired primary school teacher Mrs Davies is equally adamant Crawford is not responsible for her violent attack, and that her rapist is still at large.

The Bajan man's defence is being funded by former actress Hilary Heath, 66, who was herself raped on the island eight years ago.

Mrs Heath, who formally complained about the lacklustre police response to her case, had also taken the decision to waive her anonymity to claim authorities were doing nothing to warn women of the threat of sex attacks on the island, and were failing to properly investigate them when they did occur.

Dr Turner moved to Barbados to take up an environmental research post at the University of the West Indies two years ago. As she walked along a narrow path to the beach on a Saturday afternoon in October she was set upon by a man who dragged her into a deserted hotel building, raped her, and then fled.

Just two days later widow Mrs Davies, who was enjoying a holiday alone on the island, was dragged from the same beach path and raped in an identical attack. She was left with a broken collarbone and ribs.

But the victims cannot take any 
solace in the fact a man has been charged with the crime, because they 
are certain he is not the guilty party.

Neither Dr Turner nor Mrs Davies recognised Derick Crawford when they were shown his photograph by police.

'When I heard him speak I just knew 
then it definitely was not him. His face is all wrong and his voice is all wrong,' Dr Turner told The Independent.

Both women say Crawford is significantly older than their attacker, who they independently identified as being in his thirties.

'They have made no effort to find him. That is the crux of the matter,' Mrs Davies told the newspaper.

Savage: Diane Davies, seen left after being attacked on Barbados, and right at home on Anglesey, North Wales, is convinced Derick Crawford is not the man who dragged her into a deserted hotel and raped her

Mrs Heath, who is now an addiction 
counsellor, moved to the island 10 years ago to take up a post at Verdun
House, a charitable foundation working with drug addicts that are 
released from prison.

She was asleep at her home on the island in April 2004 when she was raped at knifepoint by a masked intruder in a savage attack.

Mrs
Heath said she had to beg for DNA swabs to be taken when she went to 
hospital after the attack, that officers failed to gather vital 
evidence, and that a senior police shouted and laughed at her during a 
meeting.

Her attacker,
Venslow Small, was eventually captured after leaving his phone at the 
scene of another crime. He went on to be convicted of raping Mrs Heath 
and 16 other women.

The 
former actress, who waived her anonymity after learning of Mrs Davies' 
horrific ordeal on the island, said: 'When I heard about Diane's case I 
thought "My God, they have done nothing".'

Mrs Heath also described the timing of Crawford's arrest shortly after she spoke to the press about her concerns regarding sex attacks on Barbados as a 'strange coincidence'.

The Barbados Police Complaints Authority has said Mrs Heath's case had been investigated and that a response would be send to her shortly.

Both Dr Turner and Mrs Davies have written to the Commissioner of Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions to complain about the handling of their cases.

Police Commissioner Darwin Dottin has confirmed that the two women had contacted authorities, but added that it was 'utterly wrong' to suggest that the country's reputation was given priority over the welfare of visitors.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
