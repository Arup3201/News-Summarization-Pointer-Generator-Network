The former school of England's superstar footballer Wayne Rooney has been threatened with closure.

The future of Our Lady and St Swithin's Catholic Primary School has been thrown into doubt as council bosses want to it demolished in a £3.5 million move to drive up standards.

Manchester United forward Rooney, 27, shone in the school's football team in the Liverpool suburb of Croxteth where he developed the skills that have made him a household name across the globe.

Judgement: The school is among the 20 per cent of schools in the country not judged as 'good' or 'outstanding' by Ofsted

The school, which also counts ex-Arsenal player Francis Jeffers as a former pupil, is within the 20 per cent of schools not classed as 'good' or 'outstanding' by education watchdog Ofsted.

A Liverpool City Council source has said it is believed moving it to a new site 'will help improve standards'.

But plans to relocate the school from its Parkstile Lane site, where it has been based since 1840, to the same site as Croxteth secondary St John Bosco college has sparked anger in former pupils and residents.

Janet Dale, 55, who has a grandchild at the school, said: 'I went to that school, my children went there and now my grandchild goes there.

'It has been there for decades and is part of the community.'

She said there were fears that the relocation was linked to plans to attract online retailer Amazon to Liverpool.

Beginnings: Rooney began to develop his footballing skills at the school, which would eventually see him become a global household name

The possible location of the warehouse on the Stonebridge Cross site, just half a mile from the primary school, has meant that a previous masterplan for Croxteth is being redrawn.

Previously, 500 new homes, a new home for St John Bosco college and a supermarket were planned, but the college is being rebuilt on its current site.

The council insisted the proposal to move Our Lady and St Swithin’s was not linked to the Amazon plans.

A spokesman said: 'There is a proposal to co-locate Our Lady and St Swithin’s with St John Bosco as part of our Secondary Schools Investment Plan.

'This is just a proposal at this stage and a consultation exercise is under way to get all views before a final decision is made by the Archdiocese.'

A spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese said: 'No decision has yet been made.'
