Hundreds of Air New Zealand passengers have been stranded in Hawaii after being caught up in two-day delays.

More than 220 holidaymakers have been forced to stay for longer on the stunning US island due to a fault on the carrier’s Boeing 767-300.

As well as having their trip extended, passengers have also been awarded £500 compensation for the delays.

Stranded: 227 holidaymakers have been stuck on Hawaii for two days due to a faulty plane

A faulty indication system prompted pilots to abort flight NZ09 at takeoff on Sunday. 

And a number of rescheduled departures have since been cancelled after Air NZ failed to repair the fault.

The airline has issued an ‘unreserved apology’ to the passengers and offered compensation.Passengers are set to spend a third night in hotels after being again sent away from the airport this afternoon.

General manager of customer experience, Carrie Hurihanganui, said: ‘Due to the lengthy nature of this disruption, the difficulty we've experienced in adequately communicating with customers and the fact we have repeatedly let them down, we have made the decision that in addition to our unreserved apology we will also be compensating each customer $1000 in either cash or Airpoints Dollars.

‘Due to an unfortunate combination of events this group of passengers has travelled to Honolulu Airport on three occasions expecting to fly, however, on each occasion the aircraft has been unable to depart because of a series of evolving engineering issues.

‘A part was required and we attempted to source a replacement within the US, however, despite assurances, the right part was not supplied. Fortunately, as a backup, we also loaded the part onto NZ10 from our Auckland Technical Operations base this morning and this will arrive in Honolulu this evening.’

The part will be fitted ‘as a priority’, and the flight, now operating as NZ6889, was scheduled to leave at 7.30am on Tuesday local time.

Mrs Hurihanganui added: ‘We are incredibly sorry to have let our customers down and will conduct a full review to see how we could have managed this disruption better.’

Around half of those affected by delays had been transferred to an Hawaiian Airlines flight to Auckland earlier in the afternoon, she said, more than an earlier reported 90 passengers.

They will arrive in Auckland tonight.
