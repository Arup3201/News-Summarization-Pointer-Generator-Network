The year was 2009 when a shy and dyslexic Australian 16-year-old defied the odds and set off on a solo unassisted world journey to sail the rough seas - a dream she'd had since the age of 12.

Five years later, Jessica Watson, now 21, still seems to be dreaming of her adventures instead of keeping her head in the books.

Ms Watson, who was named Young Australian of the Year in 2011, has been studying sociology at university and has documented the 'normal' school life she's having on social media.

Jessica Watson is now an average university student studying youth and social work after becoming one of the youngest people to sail around the world in 2009 when she was just 16

'Enjoying my first week studying on campus, pretty sure no one has recognised me #touchwood #normal,' she tweeted with a photo of her uni books.

Ms Watson also captioned a photo of her study notebooks with water in the background saying: 'Wishing I was sailing rather than studying today'.

The teen adventurer from the Gold Coast, Queensland, made headlines when she sailed the world's most challenging seaways for seven months in 2009, including Cape Horn and the Southern Ocean.

She sailed back in to Sydney Harbour in May 2010 just before her 17th birthday.

Her university degree seems rather incomparable after surviving storms, loneliness and several knockdowns in her Ella's Pink Lady yacht.

She also detailed in her blog that she had to conduct multiple repairs on her boat including the toilet, engine, battery monitor and mainsail.

Ms Watson, who was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia two years ago following her sailing feat, posted on her blog in 2012 that she was taking up a youth and social work course at university but it's believed she was studying online up until now.

'The big thing I took away from (the sailing) was that I love sailing and I love what I am doing now,' she wrote.

'But I also realised that I love working with schools and working with different organisations. That's why I am doing a university course with youth work/social work areas in mind.'

Ms Watson continued to add to her list of sailing accolades following the around the world trip when she joined a young crew of nine in the 2011 Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race. They were the youngest sailors to complete the blue water classic.

She was also the first female skipper to cross the line in the race that year, which earned her the annual Jane Tate Memorial Trophy.

The inspirational young Aussie has also taken up a role with the United Nations World Food Programme.

She will also be a consultant on the film True Spirit - based on her book - when production begins this year.
