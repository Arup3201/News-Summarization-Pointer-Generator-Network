Strolling with her new husband in the sunshine, Muslim convert Lauren Booth looks as happy as you’d expect any newlywed to be.

Her broad smile, however, betrays a controversy which has seen her branded a home-wrecker.

The 45-year-old, who is Cherie Blair’s half-sister, married Sohale Ahmed, 49, in a Muslim ceremony earlier this year.

He, though, is said to be still legally wed under British law to Faiza Ahmed, his wife of 16 years.

Mrs Ahmed has accused Miss Booth of stealing her husband after being invited into their home as a guest and dishonouring her new religion with brash, flirty behaviour.

Miss Booth and Mr Ahmed were seen stepping out together in Hampstead Garden Suburb, North London, where she lives in a £500,000 apartment with her two daughters.

Her body almost totally concealed, Miss Booth mixed traditional clothing with modern items, wearing a patterned dress and a grey cardigan over what appeared to be a long loose-fitting black abaya. She also wore a pink hijab head-covering.

In the shadows of his far taller new wife, Mr Ahmed wore a more conventional combination of jeans and jumper.

Mr Ahmed’s first wife is now looking after their three sons in Texas after she left the family home in Greater Manchester to stay with her brother.

The 37-year-old is separated from her husband, but says they have not divorced.

She said: ‘Lauren destroyed my home. You can’t just put  on a hijab and say you are a good Muslim woman – it’s about having boundaries with men, and love and respect for women.’

Lauren and her half-sister Cherie Blair, have had a difficult relationship at times after Lauren was so publicly critical of Tony Blair's decision to take the UK to war in Iraq when he was Prime Minister

Faiza Ahmed is still legally married to Sohale Ahmed under British law

Mrs Ahmed claims her husband married Miss Booth in a secret nikah, or religious ceremony, which she only found out about in February when her husband called her to ask for a divorce.

Islamic law states that Muslim men can marry four women. While a nikah is significant religiously, it is not recognised as legal marriage in Britain unless the couple have also registered at a UK Register Office. Miss Booth was formerly married to actor Craig Darby, with whom she had two daughters.

They divorced after he suffered brain injuries in a motorbike crash.

In October 2010, she announced she was converting to Islam, saying she was drawn to the religion because of ‘an appreciation of Muslim culture, in particular that of Muslim women’.

Mr Ahmed said he disputed the comments made by his first wife.
