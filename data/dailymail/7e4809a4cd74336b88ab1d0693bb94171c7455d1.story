Social network billionaire Sean Parker has announced that he is donating $24 million to an allergy research center at Stanford University after battling food allergies for much of his life.

The 35-year-old former Facebook president and Napster co-founder says his aim is to find a lasting cure for the medical condition.

Food sensitivities to nuts, shellfish, avocado and other foods have landed the tech whiz in hospital at least 14 times in the last six years, including once while attending the World Economic Forum in Davos.

He said the problem also meant he missed most of his final year in high school.

Now that Parker is the father of two small children, he says he's even more eager to find a solution. 

As yet, neither his two-year-old daughter or his two-week-old son have allergies but that could change over time.

'Now that I'm a father, I'm sympathetic to what my parents went through,' Parker said Wednesday. 

'It's terrifying for parents to see their child go through anaphylactic shock because of an allergic reaction.'

It's hoped the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy Research will open within the next two years at the Stanford University School of Medicine.

The complex will focus on understanding the dysfunctions of the immune system that result in allergic reactions.

It will also develop  treatments  through laboratory and data research, clinical trials and community outreach.

Dr. Kari Nadeau, an esteemed immunology researcher who focuses on allergies on children and adults, will lead the institute.

Nadeau has developed an allergy treatment that involves giving patients micro-doses of the allergen and increasing the amount ingested - over months or years - to build tolerance overtime.

'The goal is to be able to achieve desensitization in a couple of weeks,' Parker said.

He concluded: 'We have been applying Band-Aids for decades by using antihistamines to treat symptoms instead of going after the root cause of allergies.'
