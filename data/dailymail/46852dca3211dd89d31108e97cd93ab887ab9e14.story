Fashion retailer Urban Outfitters has been criticised by drugs campaigners for selling shot glasses made to look like prescription pill medication.

The chain is selling a number of products, including flasks and pint glasses, with decoration which are marked with an Rx to resemble drug labelling.

One flask is marked as 'Boozemin HydroAlki' while a shot glass says 'Prescription shot - take one by mouth until intoxicated. Quantity - as many as you can stomach'.

Critics say hip flasks like this one sold by Urban Outfitters are trivialising prescription drug abuse

An online petition has been launched by anti-drug group The Partnership at Drugfree.org which believes the products belittles the problem of teen abuse of prescription drugs.

The campaign has been supported by political leaders in the U.S. state of Kentucky where prescription painkiller abuse is rife.

Republican Hal Rogers, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, complained that the products trivialise the pain and suffering of people struggling with addiction.

'I fear the sale of these items could have the unfortunate consequence of leading more teens to seek out prescription meds, or even worse, an increase in prescription drug-related overdoses,' Rogers said in a letter to the company.

Political leaders have joined a campaign calling on Urban Outfitters to withdraw the products from their shelves

'I would encourage you to remove these items from the shelves immediately so as not to contribute to this epidemic.'

Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway is also supporting the cause.

'These products make light of an 
epidemic that kills more than 1,000 Kentuckians each year and is 
responsible for more deaths than heroin and cocaine combined,' said 
Conway, co-chairman of the Substance Abuse Committee of the National 
Association of Attorneys General.

'Combined with alcohol, the misuse and
abuse of prescription medications can be deadly, making the Urban 
Outfitter Rx pint and shot glasses and flasks even more disturbing.'

Conway said prescription drugs are
now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, and he 
said too many teens are experimenting with them, believing that they are 
safer than street drugs.

The Urban Outfitters' products, he
said, could reinforce that belief. 'This type of cavalier attitude puts
more teens at risk,' Conway said.

Urban Outfitters has not responded to the campaign or request for comment from the MailOnline at the time of publishing.
