'Suicide': Anna Oung, 29, was found in the trunk of her car and police believe she killed herself

A woman whose body was found in the trunk of her car by her husband killed herself after suffering from 'postpartum psychosis' three months since the birth of her first child, police believe.

The body of 29-year-old Anna Oung was found on Tuesday evening in her car parked in Irvine, California when her concerned husband tracked her mobile phone service using GPS.

'All the evidence investigators have discovered to date', including preliminary results from a coroner's medical examination, is 'consistent with the death being a suicide', Irvine police Lt. Julia Engen said.

Since the birth of the couple's first child three months ago, Oung had been diagnosed with postpartum psychosis and was receiving treatments, friends and family told police, the Orange County Register reported.

It is a rare mental illness that comes on quickly after the birth of a child, and includes symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, feeling irritated, hyperactivity and a decreased need for sleep, paranoia and changing mood swings.

The announcement comes despite the Orange County Coroner's Office not yet determining an official cause of death. A 'final ruling' on the cause will be made in the coming weeks, Engen said.

Oung's husband, who has not been named, had become concerned after his wife was several hours late returning home from work and called the Long Beach Police Department to report her missing.

Final resting place: The car was found parked near the University of California-Irvine, though the husband had no reason why it would be there

Home: Though the couple lives in this Los Angeles home, there is no clear reason why Oung would have been near the college campus

Postpartum Psychosis is the most most extreme postpartum mood disorder that has a quick onset quickly after a woman gives birth.

Symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, feeling irritated, hyperactivity and a decreased need for sleep, paranoia and changing mood swings.

Women are most at risk if they have a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, or if they have had a previous psychotic episode.

It is rare compared to the rates of 
postpartum depression or anxiety, occurring approximately one to two out 
of every 1,000 deliveries. It usually occurs within the first four weeks 
after giving birth and is more common in first-time mothers.

Postpartum psychosis has a five per cent suicide rate and a four per cent infanticide rate.

Five hours later, with the help of his cell phone company, he found her silver Honda sedan in a residential area near the campus of University of California-Irvine a few miles from where she works.

Her husband has no idea how or why it got there but it appeared to be unoccupied.

Because he did not have the keys to the car, he called police who then opened the trunk and found Ms Oung's dead body.

Very few specifics about the case have been released publicly.

Police have announced that there was visible bruising on Ms Oung's body, but they would not say how or what caused the injuries.

The 'unusual nature of the discovery' at first led police to term the incident 'suspicious', but authorities said foul play is no longer suspected.

'It's really sad... shocking,' one of Ms Oung's neighbors told local KTLA.

'He was always bike riding and just always with her.

'Every time she came, he was outside helping her park... They were always happy,' the neighbor said of the couple.
