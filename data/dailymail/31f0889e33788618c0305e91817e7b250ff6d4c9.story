An iconic mansion given to Idaho by the billionaire founder of the McDonald's french fry has been handed back to his heirs because it's too expensive to run, it was announced yesterday.

J.R. Simplot, whose company Simplot invented the frozen fry in 1953 and has been the primary supplier of the potato snack to McDonald's for more than 50 years, gifted the luxurious property overlooking his home city of Boise to the state in 2004.

The eccentric billionaire, who grew up in a log cabin and had just $80 when starting his company at age 14, decided he wanted his family home to belong to his beloved state and it should become the governor's house.

Thanks but no thanks: J.R. Simplot's mansion will be returned to his heirs by Idaho which was gifted the property in 2004

Mr Spud: J.R. Simplot built a multi-billion dollar fortune in agriculture and specifically providing McDonald's with potatoes for their fries

However, after nine years of being snubbed by governors not wanting to look too lordly by living in the home and a cost of $150,000 a year maintaining it - mostly watering its lush green lawns - city officials have decided it is more hassle than it's worth.

On Friday a meeting of the Idaho Governor's Housing Committee agreed to return the 7,379 square foot property, valued at $2million in 2004, to the billionaire Simplot heirs.

The agreement said though officials are 'very grateful' for the gift they believe it's 'in the best interest of the state and the Simplot family to return it.'

Simplot's heirs originally insisted Idaho keep the property but are now said to be more amenable to taking it back.

Flying the flag: Simplot's one stipulation in his multi-million dollar gift was that an American flag fly over the property at all times

J.R Simplot is a well-known figure in the town of Boise where he founded his small agricultural company in 1929 specializing in potatoes and onions.

His fortunes rocketed overnight when company scientist Ray Dunlap invented the frozen french frie and made the company millions - not least of all from its work for the fast food chain which it started supplying back in 1960.

Down-to-earth Simplot's favorite food was said to be McDonald's fries or hash browns made from his own produce and he often stopped in the chain to enjoy the snack despite his vast wealth. 

He donated millions to the town including the mansion at 4000 Simplot Lane which was home to the Simplot family before his death in 2008 at age 99. 

Uncertain future: It is unclear what will now happen to the Simplot mansion which will be returned to the family by the end of June

Open doors: The mansion was generously gifted to the state but they claim it is too expensive to maintain

Patriot: The proud entrepreneur from Idaho wanted to use his wealth to support the state by donating the house

As he donated it the agricultural baron known as Mr Spud, who by then had also set up Micron Technology making microchips, said: 'As governors go and come, they'll enjoy it, I hope. They won't have any trouble from
me, that's for sure.'

The house has it's own website and is described as the 'State of Idaho Executive Residence' or 'Idaho House' in short.

The website says: 'It serves as the center of the First Family's ceremonial, social and political activities.

'Because the house is also a significant landmark in the valley, ever attempt it made to share this beautiful home with Idaho's citizens while continuing to meet the building's primary function as home for the State's chief executive'.

No one home: Governors have snubbed the mansion choosing to remain in their own homes

Ironically it has never actually been home to a governor with officials snubbing it lest they be seen as snobbish.

Some residents oppose the state's decision to ditch the property which now faces an uncertain future.

Resident Michael Kostanecki told a public meeting in October: 'You can't have Idaho without that flag and without that hill. If we have any pride in the guy who really helped develop the state, we should keep it the way it is.'

The property, which comes with 37.479 acres, has the condition that a 30-by-50 American flag continually fly on a 130 foot flagpole above the house on the hilltop overlooking the town.

At a meeting in October it emerged much of the maintenance fee was being spent on keep the house's lush lawn watered.

$300,000 was also spent furnishing the mansion. 

It will be returned to the family by June 30 and be emptied over the next 30 days.

The state has said it may look at building a new Governor's house which is more manageable once the transfer is complete.

However, the cost of maintaining the mansion is so high, city officials have now opted to hand it back to his heirs

Some are angry at the decision and believe it is disrespectful to the french frie maker and local legend known as 'Mr Spud'
