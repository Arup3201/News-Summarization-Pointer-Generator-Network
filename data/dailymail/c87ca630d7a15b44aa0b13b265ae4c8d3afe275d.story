Holidaymakers and business travellers faced travel chaos after heavy rain caused a power cut at one of the country's busiest airports.

Frantic airport staff were forced to use flipboards as make-shift departure boards after the power went out at Gatwick's busy South Terminal, used by thousands of passengers every day.

Workers also had to use megaphones instead of tannoy announcements after the power to the terminal's check-in, baggage systems and parts of the 
departure lounge was cut off.

Early theories suggested that heavy rain could have caused a short circuit at the airport.

A
statement from Gatwick said: 'We are currently experiencing a 
power outage affecting some operational systems in the South Terminal.

'Unfortunately this is causing some delays for passengers and we apologise for any inconvenience this is causing.

'We are working to fix the problem and looking at what contingencies we can put in place in the meantime to minimise disruption.

'We
advise all passengers scheduled to fly out of the South Terminal today 
to check the status of the flight with their airline first and check the
flight information on our website.

'We are also advising passengers to expect some delays.'

One passenger, Lance Price, tweeted: 'Chaos at Gatwick. Water got into the electrics, power out and no flights going anywhere. Announcements via megaphone and a whiteboard!'

Another tweet, from a Sandy Holford, said: 'Complete bedlam at Gatwick, almost all systems down and those that are up show the wrong info.'

Other passengers took to Twitter to describe their various predicaments.

Ian Graham said: 'Just back from Croatia and stuck on plane due to flooding and power cut at Gatwick.'

Adrian Simpsonwrote: 'You can add rain to the list of things that @Gatwick-Airport can't handle. Stuck in plane with airport flooded and no power. Fun.'

Air passengers had already faced long 
delays and cancellations after most of the country was coated in a 
blanket of thick early-morning fog.

The
poor visibility led to disruption at Gatwick, as well as at Heathrow and London City airports, with British Airways among the many airlines affected.

The
weather was set to bring more woe over the course of the day, with 
heavy rain due to sweep across the country as autumn set in.

Heathrow said that BA had been forced to cancel seven flights at Heathrow because of the fog.

'There's
been fog this morning and there has been some disruption to flights at 
Heathrow, London City and Gatwick,' said a spokesman from the airline.

Passengers were being advised to check on their flight status at London City Airport with some journeys facing delays.

A London City spokesman said: 'Due to
low visibility this morning, flights to/from London City Airport are 
experiencing disruptions.

'Passengers are advised to contact their airlines for more information.'

Meanwhile, on the railways, a freight train derailment meant disruption to all routes running through Gloucester.

This was affecting passengers travelling with the Arriva Trains Wales, CrossCountry and First Great Western train companies.

And rail commuters were left facing disruptions for the remainder of the week, with engineers predicting that repairs to the line may not be completed until Sunday.

Walkers on Parliament Hill this 
morning were left shrouded in mist, while the iconic Tyne Bridge in 
Newcastle was also coated in the celebrated 'fog on the Tyne'.

The River Cam in the university city of 
Cambridge was shrouded with mist as rowers practised on the water,

Weather forecasters 
were predicting that this morning's fog would make way for a band of 
heavy rain and strong winds, set to sweep across the country from 
Cornwall and up in a north-easterly direction.

'We have got a front moving across the country today,' said a Met Office spokesman.

'It's moving from the south towards the north east.

'We have got a line of wet and 
windy weather moving across the country, it has been moving up through 
the South West this morning, there has been heavy rain, a lot of cloud 
and a bit of fog around.'

Despite the chilly start, experts at the Met Office were predicting warmer temperatures for later in the day.

However, while the south will become brighter and 
milder as the fog clears, the North was set to remain grey, cold and windy 
with some heavy rain showers.

An eerie start: Temperatures took a dip this morning with the foggy start, although Thursday is set to be warmer

'As the rain and fog clears, coming up behind it is a brighter forecast with warmer temperatures of around 16 to 18 degrees across the south of the country where it will be a bit warmer.

'Once it has moved through we will see some sun and windy showers across the south west and Wales, the front is moving quite slowly - it won't rush through as it moves across north Wales and the North East.

'Northern Scotland will stay fairly cold and cloudy and will get a little bit colder as the front moves across.'

Tomorrow (Thurs) northern areas are due to stay cloudy with outbreaks of rain and a chance of wintry showers 
in the Scottish mountains.

The rest of the country is set to see a mix of 
locally heavy showers and sunny spells, with temperatures slightly 
higher than average in some places with highs of 18C.

The mild weather will remain on Friday and into the weekend, with highs of 19C on Saturday.

Friday and Saturday are expected to be a mix of clear and bright spells and scattered showers.
