A video of a visually-impaired samosa street seller in India refusing a generous gift of money from a  stranger has gone viral.

Posted on YouTube by Indian actor Varun Pruthia whose 'Bringing Humanity Back' videos have made him an internet sensation, the clip shows him approaching a man sitting on the ground selling samosas.

Priced at just 10 rupees for two samosas, the man is left astonished when Delhi-based Mr Pruthia gives him 1000 rupees, saying: 'God sent this for you' before walking off without waiting for his change.

1000 rupees is around £10, and with more than 40% of Indians earning just 78 pence a day, a one thousand rupee note is the equivalent of two weeks' wages.

However, rather than accepting the money, the samosa seller chases after him and insists on giving him his money back.

'Sir, I don't need 1000 rupees,' he says, 'what I make with my efforts is enough for me.

'Give this to someone more needy than me,' insists the street seller to Mr Pruthia who smiles at him in astonishment.

After pausing a moment Mr Pruthia says: 'Ok, please hold this,' and hands the seller the samosas whilst he goes to get smaller currency. 'You're an inspiration,' he adds as he looks in his wallet.

Mr Pruthia gives the street vendor Rs100 and waits patiently as the man counts out his Rs90 in change. 

'A big salute to you sir for your honesty,' says the actor, still clearly in shock, '...never give up in life.'

Mr Pruthia then asks the man for a hug and as they embrace  the food seller says: 'I just want money for my efforts, here is your change.'

Both men smile at each other, salute and part ways.

The video then goes black and a message comes on the screen:

'There are people who have money, and people who are rich.

'He [the samosa seller] teaches us that money doesn't make you rich, attitude does.

'Share this if he makes you proud to be human.'

The street seller insists that he doesn't need the money and that it should be given to someone more in need

The video is just one of many similar clips online of Mr Pruthia carrying out acts of kindness on the streets of India to promote his #BringingHumanityBack campaign.

The actor, who for the last ten months has been posting kindness videos on his YouTube and Facebook pages, has become an inspiration for many across the globe, and has even started his own 'nomination' trend on social media.

Mr Pruthia is encouraging people to help 'hardworking, needy people with money in the next 48 hours.

'Record their reaction, upload the video on your Facebook profile and name it #BringBackHumanity and nominate three friends to complete the challenge in 72 hours.'
