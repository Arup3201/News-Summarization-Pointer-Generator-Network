Police have released a shocking video that captures the heart-stopping moment an Australian tourist  ploughed his speeding jet ski into that of 16-year-old Californian girl causing brain injuries that killed her.

In the cellphone footage the 20-year-old Tyler Dagley can be seen standing on his jet ski and not looking  in the direction he is traveling as he heads straight for Kristen Fonseca.

Prosecutors say he was looking instead at his girlfriend, Natasha Ryan, who shot the video during their vacation in Hawaii in August.

Dagley was released from prison this week after pleading  no contest to third degree negligent homicide was and ordered to serve of community service and pay Miss Fonseca's family $78,000.

Miss Ryan is said to have tried to delete
two videos of the accident and claimed not to have seen it but 
detectives recovered the footage as they scoured her cell phone and she has been charged with hindering prosecution.

Noticing the upcoming obstacle she 
can be heard screaming 'watch out!' as he nears the girl but he keeps 
going, oblivious, and the two collide in a horrific smash.

As 
he rammed the teen the collision caused her head to ricochet off the 
steering column of her jet ski, throwing her into the water.

Appearing in court on Thursday, Dagley said he was 'deeply sorry' as he pled no contest to third degree negligent homicide.

The footage was shot by Natasha Ryan, who later claimed not to have seen the crash, deleting two videos from her cell phone

'I am deeply sorry for what I have done,' he said.

'I never meant any harm and I pray every morning, noon and night for Kristen and her family.'

Dagley was given a deferred jail sentence and ordered to serve a day of community service each month. He must also pay $78,138.06 in restitution to Fonseca's family.

He left the courtroom with his parents, Alan and Ann, free to return to Australia, where he will have to set up probation arrangements in Australia.

If he stays out of trouble for a year his U.S. record will be wiped clear.

Ryan, 21, who is free on $500 bail, didn't attend her arraignment on Friday in Honolulu District Court.

Because she's charged with a misdemeanor, she was allowed to waive her appearance. Her defense attorney, Walter Rodby, asked for a two-month continuance to prepare a possible plea bargain.

She faces a maximum sentence of a year in jail and a $2,000 fine.

Rodby said Ryan wants to enter a plea by mail, Rodby but declined to say whether she's returned to Australia, where she works as a dental hygienist.

'She wants to resolve this as quickly as she can,' even though there's no extradition between Australia and the United States for misdemeanors, he said.

He said she acted out of fear. 'At the time the video was erased, Tyson was still in the hospital,' he said. 'His parents were on the way. I can tell you Natasha wasn't thinking straight.

'Natasha was here alone and I can tell you that she wasn't thinking 
straight, and she thought in some ways that [deleting the videos] would be a good thing to do 
for Tyson.'

Speaking ahead of Dagley's sentencing, Fonseca's step-father Mario 
Cantone said: 'We have a huge hole in our family, and all taken away 
from us in a split second by an individual who was negligent.

'Our family's life is turned 
upside-down. We are unable to function at home. We go to sleep crying, 
wake up crying,' said Mario Cantone, Fonseca's step-father.

Unhappy
that no felony charges were pressed against Dagley, the Fonseca family 
spoke of their grief and anger at their sudden loss.

'I
cry in the morning, I cry before I go to sleep, I cry randomly during 
the day looking for justice,' said Evangelina Fonseca, the 16-year-old's
mother.

'I mean I'm 
not trying to make this guy suffer, but I need for him to understand 
that there's a consequence to every decision we make.

'That's the kind of daughter my daughter was, a very forgiving child, and so I know that it's what she would want me to do.'

Reading a poem that her daughter 
composed when she was eight-years-old, Mrs. Fonseca's hands trembled as 
she read her dead daughter's words.

Kristen Fonseca's poem wonders out loud if she will ever have children and how she wants to be a doctor when she grows up.

Tyler
Dagley reportedly cried as he heard his victim's words and will be 
asked to pay $78,000 in restitution to the family for his actions.

Monique Sanchez, Kristen's sister told ABC News she witnessed the crash that killed her sister.

'He was just speeding really fast and then just came up and just slammed right into her,' said Sanchez.

The tragic teen's step-father Mario Cantone also spoke to ABC News of what he saw when the accident occurred.

'I then saw her head lunge forward, and hit the steering wheel. Kristen then fell forward, fell back and then fell into the water,' said Cantone.

'As far as I'm concerned that is not enough, that individual was operating the Jet Ski in a totally unsafe negligent manner,' her step-father, Mario Cantone, told Fox 40.

Evangelina Fonseca told the court of her daily grief since the death of her 16-year-old child

Dagley, who suffered spinal injuries and a concussion in the crash, said he deeply regretted the accident and prayed Kristen would be OK before hearing of her death.

'Ever since I was in the hospital I prayed everyday, just to the family, and prayed that everything was going to be okay with the girl,' Dagley, who has now been in custody a week, said in court.

Court documents say Dagley was heard at the scene saying, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't believe what I did. I'm so sorry.'

In a lawsuit filed on Monday in Honolulu's circuit court, the Fonseca family also names Aloha Jet Ski, the company that rented the watercrafts to the pair, as a defendant.

The suit claims employees did nothing to prevent Dagley from driving recklessly.

An employee who rented the jet ski to Fonseca's family and Dagley 'failed to give any instructions or warnings about driving at excessive speeds' before handing the man control, the papers state.

Kristen was due to begin a work placement as a nurse at Kaiser Permanente in Vacaville on Wednesday, said her step-father, who, along with the rest of her family has returned home.

'She was excited about that. She just hated to see people in pain or hurt,' he said.

Her classmates were struggling to come to terms with the loss of the bubbly teen.

'Just to know she’s not coming back, it’s still unreal for all of us,' Lyna Jackson, a friend of Kristen's, told Fox.

Another friend, Halie Cunningham, said: 'It's really hard to deal with right now but we'll get through it. We all came out here to support her and her family and her mom.'
