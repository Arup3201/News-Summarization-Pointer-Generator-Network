She has the face that launched a million nose jobs as Duchess of Cambridge fans rush to copy her perfect nose and lovely smile.

Now, a leading celebrity cosmetic doctor has launched a new treatment that claims to give fans of Duchess, her strong cheekbones, heavy brows and perfect skin too.

The Regal Rejuvenation, which starts at £650, includes diamond facial mapping and infusions of precious stone extract, as well as Botox and hyaluronic acid injections.

But even if they can afford it, Dr Neetu Nirdosh, the beauty guru behind the treatment, says not everyone will be allowed to have it.

'I turn people away all the time,' says the doctor who offers the treatment from her Wimpole Street clinic in London's West End.

'I try not to treat people under 20 and I won't do anything if people don't need it. It's my job to give advice and guide people to the right treatments.'

The Duchess of Cambridge inspired procedure begins with diamond facial mapping, which contours the face via the use of injections.

Next comes a facial using diamond, pearl
 and 24-carat gold extracts before the look is finished off with light 
filler to the cheeks and lips.

'Kate Middleton has one of the most 
beautiful faces in the world and it’s no surprise that we are seeing 
such a huge demand from women wanting to emulate her look,' adds Dr Nirdosh.

'The Regal Rejuvenation procedure enables me to re-contour the face to 
achieve an air brushed look without make up. 

'Each face is 
individually treated and adjusted to suit the client, while still 
achieving a natural looking finish.'

That, she explains, is particularly important. 'You'll still look like you after the treatment,' she adds. 'You can't go around saying I've got Kate's nose or Angelina's lips.

'Everyone has a right to be beautiful but you will still be you - just with plumper, fresher and almost flawless skin.'

Having great skin doesn't have to mean Botox and filler; instead, it's all about taking care of it and making the most of what you have.

You don't even have to splash out on expensive face creams. From water to sunglasses, some of the best skin saviours are cheap, cheerful and already in your home.

Dr Nirdosh explains how to get A-list skin without going under the knife.

GET SOME SLEEP

'You need at least seven or eight hours a night,' explains Dr Nirdosh. 'That gives skin time to repair itself and de-stress.'

DRINK MORE WATER

'It's been said many times before but you do need to drink as much water as possible,' says the doctor.

'It flushes out toxins and hydrates skin from within.'

EAT MORE ANTIOXIDANTS

'You can't just eat for your body, you have to eat for your skin as well,' reveals Dr Nirdosh. 'Try and avoid high GI carbs such as white bread or pasta because the sugars in it break down collagen.

'Also avoid fruit if you can, because it's full of fructose which attacks collagen. You can get the same vitamins from vegetables - if you want something sweet, try tomatoes.

TAKE PLENTY OF VITAMINS

'Your skin's needs change as you age, so start off with antioxidants and B-vitamins in your 20s and 30s before adding to collagen boosters in your 40s,' explains Dr Nirdosh.

'In your 50s, take more amino acids to help replace collagen as it breaks down.'

AVOID THE SUN AND EXTREME FILLERS

'Use an SPF and stay out of the sun to keep wrinkles in check,' adds Dr Nirdosh. 'Also stay away from things like permanent fillers.

'Your face changes all the time but permanent fillers and implants don't break down with time so that's going to end up looking really bizarre.'
