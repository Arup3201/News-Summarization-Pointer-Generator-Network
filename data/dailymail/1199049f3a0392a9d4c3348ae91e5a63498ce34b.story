With battery life still topping the list of most people’s smartphone wishlists, a London-based manufacturer has launched a handset with exactly this in mind.

Kazam’s latest flagship, the Tornado 552L, has an ‘extreme’ power save mode that can extend battery life for up to a staggering 33 hours.

When the battery reaches 10 per cent the power save mode kicks in and turns the whole screen black and white.

It also shuts down or manages certain services and apps to save as much energy as possible.

This 33-hour figure is the absolute maximum and only applies when the phone is on standby.

The total battery life on standby is almost two days or 45 hours approximately. 

Frame: Metal U-shaped skeleton measuring 5.5mm thick

Processor: 1.7Ghz octa-core processor

Screen: 5.2-inch capacitive touchscreen

Cameras: 13MP main camera and 8MP front camera with Magic Focus and LED flash

Battery: 45 hours on standby plus extreme power save mode

Software: Android 5.0 Lollipop

Extras: Kazam’s cracked screen replacement, Rescue package and three-year warranty as standard

Price: To be announced, but should be in the region of £290 (€400)

As with any battery life, the length of time will drop depending on how much it is being used.

These are bold claims, however, and MailOnline will be putting the phone and its battery life to the test later this month.

Other features on the flagship phone including a 5.2-inch touchscreen.

The Tornado 552L runs the latest Android software 5.0 Lollipop, without a skin, and has a 13MP rear-facing and 8MP front-facing camera.

It runs on a 1.7Ghz octa-core processor and is super slim at 5.5mm. It is part of the same Kazam range that includes the world’s thinnest handset, the Tornado 348 at 5.15mm.

And to make the phone stronger, Kazam told MailOnline the phone has a unique so-called ‘U-shaped’ skeleton, or frame, designed to withstand knocks and drops better than other models.

Elsewhere, the 552L comes with customisable gesture controls.

For example, drawing a C in front of the phone’s screen opens the camera while drawing an M plays music.

These are the stock gestures, but a range of shapes including V, W, S and Z as well as two-finger swipes up, down, left and right can be tailored to whatever function the user needs.

Plus all Kazam phones offer free cracked screen replacements for the first year, a Rescue service that gives users direct access to technical support and three-year warranties as standard.

The handset will be available across Europe but prices and availability haven’t been announced.

As a guide, the Tornado 348 starts at £249 (342 Euros) and the 552L is expected to be in the region of £290 (400 Euros).

The official price will be announced nearer the time of launch later this year.

‘MWC 2015 is a huge show for Kazam and the launch of the Tornado 552L shows our commitment to delivering a top of the range phone at an attractive price point,’ said Kazam boss Michael Coombes.

‘This phone combines distinctive, super slim design with super fast processing speeds, an incredible camera and all the unique Kazam service offerings including cracked screen replacement, Kazam Rescue and three-year warranty.’

At the event Kazam also unveiled a 4.5-inch Trooper 445L, three tablets running Windows 8.1 - called L10, L8 and L7 - and a feature phone called the Life C6.
