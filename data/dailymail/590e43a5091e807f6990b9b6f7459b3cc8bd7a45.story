Birmingham's discredited children’s services unit has been told to improve immediately – or face intervention within weeks by ministers.

Bosses were yesterday warned the Department for Education could step in before Christmas to strip the failing service of its responsibilities.

The threat follows the deaths of vulnerable youngsters Keanu Williams, two, and seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, which led to the city being branded a ‘national disgrace’ and one of the worst places to grow up in the Western world.

Head: Peter Hay, director of children's services at Birmingham City Council, said he would respect any decision that was made

The unit now faces being run by Whitehall
if an inspection this month by education watchdog Ofsted finds 
children’s services are failing for the fifth year running.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also warned that the department in England’s second city – where a third of children live in poverty – was in ‘the last chance saloon’.

Critics say the move may not make any difference. Following intervention in Doncaster in July following years of failure, the discredited council continues to play a key role.

KHYRA ISHAQ

Seven-year-old Khyra was starved to death by her mother and stepfather after social workers missed opportunities because they were said to be more interested in their careers.Khyra had been monitored and visited by at least nine social workers, education officers, teachers and police, but information was not acted upon and procedures were not followed.She died of an infection in May 2008 following a ‘chilling’ punishment regime at her home in Handsworth, Birmingham.Three social workers were disciplined after a report highlighted how some officials were more focused on ‘the rights of the adults’ and the ‘potential impact’ on their careers.KEANU WILLIAMS

The two-year-old had been seen by health workers at least 12 times with signs of abuse such as head injuries and cuts. But children’s services believed his mother Rebecca Shuttleworth when she said they were just bumps and bruises. In reality, Shuttleworth, 25, had beaten her son and his body was found in 2011 with 37 injuries including bite marks, a fractured skull and a tear in his stomach.A report last month revealed Shuttleworth, jailed in June, had been ‘surprised’ he wasn’t taken away from her at birth. It said ‘staff were distracted by his mother’s needs rather than the child’s’. At least three untrained workers – including a student on a work placement – were also put in charge of vital reviews.

The latest threat came after Education Secretary Michael Gove this week said he expected more failing authorities to be stripped of their control over children’s services.

Birmingham’s children’s services were recently criticised over missed opportunities to protect Keanu Williams before he was murdered by his mother Rebecca Shuttleworth in 2011.

In 2008, Khyra Ishaq starved to death at her home in Handsworth, Birmingham, after being withdrawn from school, with children’s care workers again criticised.

Ofsted has rated the department inadequate every year since 2009, and the DfE said yesterday another failure later this month would result in ‘further action’.

Peter Hay, director of children’s service at Birmingham since July this year, said he would respect whatever decision was taken, but said the priority must be to recruit more social workers.

Currently the department has a vacancy rate of a quarter among qualified staff and a third among supervisors, he said.

‘I’ve heard people thinking about jobs say that they’ve been told not to come to Birmingham because it’s a blot on their CV,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘I think that’s unacceptable.’

Mr Hay said the city council’s role would continue to be bringing in ‘the relationships and the money and the investment’ but admitted ‘it can’t do what it has always done’.

Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg said ministers would look closely at the next Ofsted report. ‘Clearly there have been some lamentable and indeed tragic failures,’ he told a local radio station.

‘And I think it would be a duty for any government that if that report doesn’t show that there have been significant improvements in the way in which the children’s services have been run – given that we have a moral duty to make sure that these terrible cases don’t re-occur – we would then need to step in one way or another.’

Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, branded the warning a ‘complete and utter political move’ by Coalition ministers and suggested the department be broken up and services managed at constituency level.

But Sue White, professor of social work at Birmingham University, said constant naming and shaming by Ofsted and ministers was only making the situation worse by deterring capable staff from working there.

‘In my view that process has made the patient sicker,’ she said. ‘The medicine is killing the patient.’

Last month Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw accused Birmingham of a ‘failure on a grand scale’, pointing out that infant mortality there is worse than in Cuba and on a par with Latvia.

In Doncaster, local authority services have been passed to a private firm until an independent trust is set up. But the council still retains key powers, including court orders to take children from their parents.
