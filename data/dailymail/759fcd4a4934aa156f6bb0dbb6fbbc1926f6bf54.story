A waitress turned ball-girl was left hiding her face in embarrassment after she mistakenly disrupted a televised baseball game - by fielding a live ball.

A video clip of Priscilla Daughtry picking up the ball and handing it to a young fan in the crowd at the game between Tampa Bay Rays and Philadelphia Phillies in Florida before realising her gaffe has since been viewed thousands of times on the internet.

And now customers at the original Hooters in Clearwater have begun to recognise the embarrassed waitress from the clip.

Embarrassed: Waitress Priscilla Daughtry was left red-faced when she interrupted a televised baseball game by fielding a live ball

Well fielded: Priscilla leaps from her pitch-side chair to stop a low struck ball which she doesn't realise is still in play

Video: Ooops! Hooters girl picks up live baseball

The footage shows Priscilla, dressed in trademark Hooters vest and tiny red shorts, leap from her seat to impressively stop a low struck ball with her glove.

Unwittingly, she picks the ball up and offers it to the crowd, much to the delight of one young fan who gleefully accepts.

It is only when another fan informs her that the ball was still in play when she stops it and several jeers erupt in the crowd, that she realises she has interrupted the game.

Red-faced Priscilla covers her face with her baseball glove and slinks back to her pitch-side chair.

She told Bright House Sports Network: 'As soon as I saw it coming to me I just got anxious and I scooped it right up and went over there to hand it to him (a young fan).

Boos: Priscilla is still unaware of her error despite several jeers from the Florida crowd

'Obviously, I didn’t know that it was a fair ball still in play until the fan in front of the little boy informed me.”

She added: 'I didn’t really know how to react, so, that’s why I covered my face.'

Miss Daughtry, who works at the original Hooters in Clearwater, said that customers at the restaurant are now identifying her as the girl from the clip.

But Priscilla is not the first Hooters waitress to make such a faux pas - according to the commentators this is the second incident of its kind this spring.

Even Rays manager Joe Madden complimented the waitress for her fielding skills.

Fortunately for Priscilla, her mistake didn't have too much bearing - the game was merely a practice match.
