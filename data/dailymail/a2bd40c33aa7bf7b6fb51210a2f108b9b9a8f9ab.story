A row over a seven-year-old's smart haircut has become so heated that his parents have threatened to remove him from school.

Regan Bradley, a pupil at St Brigid's RC Primary School in Manchester, upset the authorities by getting his hair styled with short sides and a combover - a style that wasn't uncommon in the much stricter schools of the 1950s.

He has been threatened with increasingly severe 'behaviour sanctions' if the style is not changed - even though the cut does not obviously breach any school rules.

'Not clear': Regan's parents, Peter and Kelly, say they do not understand why the cut is unacceptable

According to St Brigid's guidelines, tramlines, mohicans and gel are banned - along with anything deemed 'distracting'.

Julie Miles, the headteacher of St Brigid's, threatened to drag the Bradley family into a meeting with the chair of the school governors over the controversial cut.

But Regan's parents - beautician Kelly, 28, and father Peter- insist the style is 'just a normal haircut'.

Ms Bradley said: 'Mrs Miles is saying his hair doesn’t comply with policy. But I don’t understand why and we’re not cutting it.

'It’s becoming so bad I’m thinking of taking him out.'

Rules: St Brigid's RC Primary School in Manchester has regulations against many hair styles

Mr Bradley added: 'They are saying it needs to be the same length all over, but that’s a bowl cut and we’re not doing that.

'It is our decision how Regan has his hair, we are his parents, so it is unfair to keep picking on him.'

Mrs Miles said: 'Regan is a lovely little boy who is liked by all the staff and who always wants to do his best.

'Our uniform and appearance policy - which is linked to our behaviour policy - provides parents with clear guidelines on what is acceptable in terms of hair styles and what isn't.

'Rules are applied fairly and consistently throughout the school and are not bent for individual children.'
