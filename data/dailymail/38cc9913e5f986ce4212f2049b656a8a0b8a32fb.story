Arms aloft, Syrian fighters celebrate the moment the notorious black flag of Islamic State fanatics is torn down from above the beleagured city of Kobane.

The soldiers marked their victory by raising their own symbolic flags on a hill where the black banner of IS once flew, while triumphant fighters shot bullets into the sky and embraced each other on Kobane's war-ravaged streets.

The rebel fighters celebrated after placing two white flags of their Fajr al-Hurreya brigade (Dawn of Freedom) on top of a hill in Kobane. Other flags on the hill were from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), who helped defeat the militants.

Kurdish fighters are now rebuilding the town on the Syria-Turkey border after bravely expelling IS with the assistance of American-led Coalition forces.

The four-month battle culminating in the 'defeat' of the insurgents was a significant victory for both the Kurds and the Coalition forces who trained them. 

The children who fled the streets of the city to escape the threat of Islamic State terrorists are now returning home to find their homes in ruins.

Many of their homes, schools and hospitals  fell inside the battle zone and were subsequently destroyed in the months of fighting.

On Monday, a Kurdish militia group known as the People's Protection Units (YPG) said Kobane had been 'completely liberated' from Islamic State, who it refers to using the pejorative Arabic acronym 'Daesh'.

A statement on their website read: 'The defeat of Daesh in Kobani will be the beginning of the end for the group.' 

IS's failure to capture the town was a major blow for the extremists whose hopes of an easy victory was disrupted by Coalition air-strikes and a resilient Kurdish militia. 

Kurdish official Idriss Nassan said: 'Daesh gambled on Kobani and lost. Their defenses have collapsed and its fighters have fled.'

The few civilians who remained in the city while fighting continued joined in the celebrations with Kurdish fighters. Most of the original 60,000 residents had already escaped to Turkey and there is no telling when they can return to their homes. 

Meanwhile US officials have have not been able to confirm Kurdish fighters have fully gained control of Kobane, but they have no reason to disbelieve their claims.

The Kurds now control around 90 per cent of the town and particularly the central and southern areas, according to a senior US official.

The official admits there is still a considerable Islamic State presence in the outlying areas of Kobane, where they continue to battle pockets of Kurdish fighters.

Kurdish officials and activists have said it is entirely in Kurdish hands with only sporadic fighting on the outer edges in the east where the militants retained some control.

According to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the  (YPG) are searching houses in the eastern suburbs to dismantle and detonate bombs left behind.

Capturing Kobane would have given  IS militants control of the border-crossing with Turkey and allowed direct lines for their positions along the frontier.

In September, Islamic State fighters began invading around 300 Kurdish villages including Kobane which sent tens of thousands of residents fleeing into Turkey.

The town became a centre-piece for the international campaign against the militants which inspired US Secretary of State John Kerry to say it would be 'morally very difficult' not to help the town.

The American-led air assault began on September 21 and Kobane itself was the target of about half a dozen daily air-strikes on average. It is estimate that 80 per cent of all Coalition air-strikes focused in and round the town. 

By early January, over 1,000 Islamic State fighters had been killed and much of its heavy weaponry destroyed. The group continued to invest in resources by bringing in hundreds of reinforcements. 

Activists said these included many teenagers and even children which signalled a shortage in its forces.

Last month, Kurdish fighters in Iraq retook the strategic town of Sinjar which had been home to many of Iraq's minority Yazidis.
