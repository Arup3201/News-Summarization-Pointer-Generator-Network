In a land as riddled with fakes as China, it’s perhaps not surprising that a less-than-authentic Thor: The Dark World poster ended up in the foyer of a cinema there.

Rather than showing the film’s hero, played by Chris Hemsworth, wrapping his muscly arm around Jane (Natalie Portman), it features Thor embracing his evil brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston).

The poster, while not genuine, inadvertently gave Marvel’s publicity campaign a huge boost, as it went viral.

It was posted to Reddit and quickly amassed hundreds of comments from amused internet users.

Some approved of the effort that had gone into the image.

Friendofabook said: ‘It's interesting how the fan made poster looks better than the real one.’

Hellmark agreed, commenting: ‘Is it just me or the poster they used look more natural than the actual poster?’

In the sequel to 2011’s smash-hit, Thor battles to save Earth and the Nine Realms from a shadowy enemy called Malekith, ruler of the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim – and tries to get his intergalactic dating with Jane back on track.

But Malekith has a super-weapon called the aether that stands in the way.

Antony Hopkins, as Odin, describes it as ‘an ancient force of infinite destruction’ and Jane as something that can ‘tear apart the very fabric of reality’, so Thor certainly has his work cut out.
