Jailed: Nurse and mother-of-two Andrea Hughes, 47

A nurse was jailed today after being found guilty of crashing her caravan in a drunken stupor as she set off on a weekend camping holiday.

Mother-of-two Andrea Hughes, 47, had been drinking Bacardi before she crashed the caravan into the kerb outside a pub, ripping two wheels off the caravan.

She was still drinking rum when the mechanic she'd called arrived, and when police got there she 'basically fell out of the car', a Kia Sorento 4x4, and was unable to hold a conversation with them.

Hughes, who has been a nurse for 28 years and now faces losing her job over the incident, was today sentenced to 12 weeks in prison and banned from driving for three years after being found guilty of drink-driving.

The incident happened last October as Hughes towed the family caravan from her home in Macclesfield to a campsite in Astbury, near Congleton, Cheshire, for a weekend break with her boyfriend, mother and sister.

As she drove along Congleton Road her caravan hit the kerb, causing two wheels to be ripped off, at about 3.45pm, Macclesfield Crown Court heard at a trial earlier this month.

She called out a mechanic but when he arrived an hour later he realised she was drunk when he smelt alcohol on Hughes' breath and saw her holding a tumbler of spirits.

Kate Marchuk, prosecuting, said: 'The
mechanic saw her sitting in the passenger-side seat of her car with the
keys in the ignition but the engine was not running.

'She seemed not fully with it and 
when she spoke again, he smelt alcohol on her breath. He saw her 
struggling towards the caravan and coming out carrying a tumbler 
containing about two-and-a-half inches of clear liquid.

'He asked her to give him the glass. 
He smelt the liquid, realised that it was some sort of spirit. He threw 
it on the ground and called the police.'

Miss Marchuk said Hughes was 
struggling for balance when the police officer arrived. She was also 
said to be struggling to keep her eyes open or hold a conversation.

The prosecutor added: 'She nearly fell over, she had to hold on to the police officer for balance.'

PC Neil Jones told the court: 'She 
basically fell out of the car. She was unsteady on her feet and we had 
to hold her up to make sure she didn't fall over and hurt herself.'

The police officer had been so 
concerned about her condition he took her to accident and emergency at 
Macclesfield Hospital - but she was diagnosed as being drunk and was 
discharged when nothing else was found to be wrong with her.

An inital breath test showed Hughes to be just over the legal limit but tests taken at the police station two hours after the crash showed she had 146mg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath. The legal limit is 35mg.

At Macclesfield magistrates court Hughes denied drink-driving but was convicted after a trial.

She looked shocked today as she was sent to prison for 12 weeks.

She was also banned from driving for three years and now faces the loss of her job.

The court had heard how in an interview the day after the smash, Hughes said she had been travelling on holiday when her caravan wobbled and swerved, so she pulled into the next lay-by.

She said she couldn't remember the mechanic attending the scene.

Hughes told police she had had coffee and a biscuit at 10am before drinking two Bacardi and cokes at around 12 noon.Â  She said her high breath test must have been influenced by what she drank after she crashed outside the Chain and Gate pub in North Rode.

There was no alcohol in the caravan, although there was a bottle of rum found - which she said must have been from a previous trip.

During her trial on January 15, Hughes claimed that she had drunk most of a bottle of rum whilst she waited for the mechanic because she was devastated at damaging the caravan, which she said was her and her boyfriend's 'pride and joy.'

She said she had drowned her sorrows because she feared he would be angry since he was supposed to be driving to the campsite, but was late home from work.

She insisted she was under the limit when she was driving.

In mitigation, defence lawyer Hojol Uddin said his client, who had no previous convictions, faced losing her job and home, which she shares with her children, aged 21 and 16.

He added: 'It is a low level of seriousness - there was no accident, there seems to be some sort of collision but no evidence that a collision took place. There were no other vehicles involved in the incident or any pedestrians.

'Her children are reliant on their mother - it will impact her financially which could potentially see her losing her home.'

But Susan Armstrong, chairwoman of the bench, said: 'This was an extremely high reading.

'Your car was towing a caravan and was involved in an accident and an aggravating feature of this case was the time of day at which there was a high level of traffic about on the busy road.

'You decided intentionally to drink alcohol and drink it before you set off. There was a potential harm to other road users.'
