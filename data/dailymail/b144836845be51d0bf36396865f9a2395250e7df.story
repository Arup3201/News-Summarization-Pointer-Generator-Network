A community is in mourning and two young children left orphaned after a couple of high school sweethearts perished tragically in a car accident Saturday while trying to avoid an animal in the road.

Toree, 33, and Bret Chandler, 38, of Chester, Illinois had spent nearly all their lives together and were raising a 6-year-old son and an 8-month-old daughter.

The couple grew up on the same street, attended the same high school and had even both recently started working at the same prison.

'They were just a couple cemented, they were perfect,' Toree's mother Sheree Nortin told KFVS. 'And their children are wonderful. Great parents great friends. And we are blessed to have them.'

Authorities say Bret was driving their Jeep Wrangler in Perryville, Missouri when he swerved the over-corrected before smashing the car into a creek bed and flipping into some trees.

A family member said it is 'believed they swerved out of the way to avoid hitting an animal on the road.

They were pronounced dead at the scene. Both were wearing their seat belts.

Distraught family members set up a Go Fund Me donation page in the wake of the tragedy.

'Due to the unexpected and tragic timing of their loss, this account is being set up to help our family cover immediate needs and also set up a scholarship fund for their 8 month old daughter Fallon and their 6 year old son Damon,' writes Toree's brother Bryan.

The fundraiser had raised over $13,000 just a day after donations began, with a goal of $20,000.

The Chandlers had an 8-month-old daughter and a son, who is 6. THe family has set up a fund to help with expenses and to take care of the now parentless children
