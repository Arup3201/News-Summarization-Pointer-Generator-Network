'A full frontal assault on poor value for money': How Pensions Minister Steve Webb dubbed the move to cap charges at 0.75 per cent

Rip-off charges which can wipe out more than a third of the value of a worker’s pension pot will be banned next year.

Pensions Minister Steve Webb described the crackdown in which charges will be capped at 0.75 per cent as ‘a full frontal assault on poor value for money’.

Over the next ten years, workers who diligently save into a pension will be around £200million better off as a result of yesterday’s announcement.

This is because the money will go into their pension pots, rather than being siphoned off in high charges by well-paid fund managers.

Mr Webb said: ‘Pension savers have paid too much for too long. It is time to put the saver first. We are going to put charges in a vice, and we will tighten the pressure, year after year.’

His announcement is a major victory for the Daily Mail, which has long campaigned against sky-high fees and charges on investment funds and pensions.

Moneymail’s Fair Play on Charges campaign has been calling for lower annual fees on people’s life savings, highlighting how they could strip tens of thousands of pounds from even a modest retirement pot.

Moneymail editor James Coney said: ‘These types of charges are iniquitous because savers never realise the damage that’s being done to their nest egg.

‘This charge cap is a major step forward and now needs to be applied to older types of pension as well as new ones.’

Pension charges – an issue which few understand or can decipher on their annual pension statement – are levied each year as a percentage of the value of the pot during an employee’s working life.

Their impact can be devastating. Take the example of a £700,000 pension pot. If the annual charge is 1.5 per cent, it eats up £236,000 of the total value of the pension pot.

If the charge is 0.75 per cent – the level at which the cap will be introduced next April – charges wipe out only £132,300.

The 0.75 per cent cap will cover all pension schemes into which around 11million workers are being ‘automatically enrolled’ by their boss. Since October 2012, bosses must pay into pensions for their workers.

An independent review, due to report at the end of the year, is deciding whether a crackdown on older company pension schemes is also necessary. The cap does not apply to non-workplace private pensions.

Mr Webb told MPs the cap will be reviewed in three years’ time and might be ‘reduced further’. Consumer group Which? is calling for a cap of 0.5 per cent.

Other charges will also be banned over the next two years, such as imposing higher fees on workers’ pensions if they have left the firm.

The long-awaited crackdown is the latest move in an extraordinary nine days, which Mr Webb, a LibDem, described as ‘truly a pensions revolution’.

In last week’s Budget, Chancellor George Osborne scrapped the rule that forces workers to buy an annuity, an income for life, from an insurer when they retire. Instead, from next April, they can take the money out of their pension pots and be taxed on it.
