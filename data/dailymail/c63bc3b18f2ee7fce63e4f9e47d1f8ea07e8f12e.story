When Nigella Lawson had her belongings moved from the marital home she shared with multi-millionaire art collector Charles Saatchi into the London flat she's staying at following their very public altercation, she probably hadn't thought her Cannabis habit would be exposed.

Luckily, for the domestic goddess, it was a perfectly legal Cannabis energy drink (£4.99, firebox.com) and not the real deal.

The can was pictured wedged into the bottom of a Perspex box along with her other most essential belongings, such as a blender and cookery books.

Nigella Lawson would appear to be a fan of Cannabis energy drinks, the high-caffeine legal tipple, packed with taurine, hemp seed extract, B vitamins and sugar, which were pictured inside one of her removal boxes

The drink, branded with a marijuana leaf and billed as ‘Amsterdam's coolest energy drink', may be guilty of crass marketing, but its ingredients are innocent.

It contains hemp seed extract, caffeine, taurine (an amino acid which helps regulate the blood), B vitamins and a substantial 11 g of sugar, so it'll give you a sugar high but not a narcotic one.

The drug cannabis is also an extract from the hemp family, but is made from a different variety of plant.

Hemp has been used for years in products such as eco-clothing and natural carpeting.

But now the oil is the biggest buzzword, as the manufacturers' boast that it is a good source of protein and essential fatty acids has led to sales of the drink soaring.

It has been available in the UK only for 18 months, but a 50 per cent rise in sales is predicted this year.

The drinks were spotted inside boxes lifted into a removal van outside the London home Nigella Lawson shared with Charles Saatchi

Hemp's natural nuttiness also lends itself to tea. German eco-brand Hanf Natur is behind a range of smoky teas made from dried hemp.

One is mixed with raspberry leaves, rosehip and hibiscus to ‘soothe and calm your senses' (£4.35 from sativabags.com). And farmers in the Swiss Alps cultivate hemp to mix with green tea for an iced drink (£1.45, thehempshop.co.uk).

Need perking up? Try hemp coffee (£8.90, hempiness.co.uk).

While the marketing for Nigella's Cannabis can and other drinks may be tasteless, their contents are anything but.
