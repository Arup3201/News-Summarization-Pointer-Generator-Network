This is the bizzare moment a mystery man holding a squirrel photobombed a live news broadcast outside Westminster. 

The incident happened as ITV journalist Romilly Weeks reported from outside the Houses of Parliament in London during a lunchtime bulletin.

The man, wearing black trousers and a black overcoat, was seen walking behind the reporter holding the rodent by its tail while Ms Weeks was talking to camera.

Her ITV colleague, Jamie Roberton, tweeted: 'A man just walked past (Ms Weeks) with a dead squirrel live on ITV News.'
