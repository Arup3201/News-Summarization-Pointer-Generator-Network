A high school science teacher is facing multiple sex charges after being accused of fondling a student and sending another sexually explicit texts and photos.

Michelle Stabach Jensen was initially arrested on obscenity charges for sending the photos and texts to one of her students.

The 'sexual explicit' material was discovered after another teacher at J.L. Mann High School in Greenville County, South Carolina, overheard other students talking about the teacher.

Michelle Stabach Jensen, 40, faces up to 15 years in jail for 'sexual battery'

When police seized the 17-year-old boy's cell phone they found lewd text messages and photographs that were sexual in nature.

Jensen, 40, resigned immediately after she was confronted with the evidence by school chiefs a week ago.

She faced obscenity charges but within 24 hours police said she facing further more serious charges of sexual battery.

According to an arrest warrant a 17-year-old student said Jensen touched his genitals while she allowed him to fondler her breasts.

Jensen was charged with two counts each of unlawful dissemination of obscene materials to persons under 18 years of age, and delinquency of a minor. Both charges are felonies.

She also faces one count of sexual battery and could be jailed for up to 15 years if convicted of all charges.

Greenville County Schools spokesman Oby 
Lyles said J.L. Mann Principal Charles Mayfield was informed on Friday, 
November 9 of allegations of inappropriate texts to students after a 
teacher reported an alleged conversation overheard between students. 

'The administration immediately began its investigation and contacted the school’s Resource Office with the Greenville City Police,' Lyles said via email Thursday.

'The principal met with the teacher that day and she resigned while the investigation continued. The charges will be communicated to the State Department of Education, which determines revocation of teaching certificates.'

Jensen is being held at the Greenville County Detention Center on $13,000 bond.
