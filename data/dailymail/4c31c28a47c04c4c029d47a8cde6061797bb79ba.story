It would appear that not all students at the Parsons New School for Design were thrilled to hear that John Galliano would soon be teaching a master class there.

A Change.org petition, which has garnered over 250 signatures, asks that the New York design college refuse to accept the controversial designer, who has sparked outrage in the past for his anti-Semitic remarks.

The petition states: 'Hiring someone who has made such horrific comments shows that the school values Galliano over their entire Jewish student body.'

Taking a stand: Students at Parsons School of Design have launched a petition against the hiring of John Galliano (pictured) to teach a master class. The designer was arrested in 2011 for anti-Semitic remarks

The letter continues: 'It is disgraceful to hire someone who has made such inhumane comments.'

The 52-year-old British designer - who was fired in 2011 from his position as head of Christian Dior after being arrested in Paris for 'racist comments' - is set to take on a three-day design workshop at the famed school.

When it was announced on Sunday that he would be involved with the new course, called Show Me Emotion, The Daily News reported that students were, for the most part, thrilled.

But the growing number of signatures on the Change.org petition would seem to indicate otherwise.

One person wrote on the website: 'By letting him back into the broad public influence, it sends the wrong message that his anti-Semitic remarks can be swept under the rug.'

Keeping his head down: Mr Galliano, who was the head designer at Christian Dior for 15 years, has kept a low profile since his arrest, attending rehab for alcoholism and doing a temporary residency at Oscar de la Renta

Another stated: 'A teacher's ethics are 
inherent in what they teach, and I do not feel that Galliano is the kind
of person that should be teaching young minds.'

The master class will reportedly include
a three-day workshop and a final assessment carried out by Mr Galliano 
and Simon Collins, Dean of Parsons.

'It is disgraceful to hire someone who has made such inhumane comments'

A letter sent to students describing the new course makes reference to the designer's influence on the fashion industry.

It reads: 'The planned master class with John Galliano will be a dynamic and intimate opportunity for our students to learn from an immensely talented designer.'

The letter goes on to acknowledge the designer's sordid past. 'We believe that over the past two years Galliano has demonstrated a serious intent to make amends for his past actions,' it stated.

Questionable ethics: The petition makes reference to Mr Galliano's disrespect towards the entire Jewish student body at Parsons, located in New York's Greenwich Village

Mr Galliano was arrested in February 2011 after a video showed him uttering anti-Semitic remarks to group of people at a Paris cafe whom he assumed were Jewish.

'I love Hitler,' the designer slurs drunkenly in the clip. 'People like you would be dead. Your mothers, your forefathers, would all be f****** gassed,' he continued.

Since the scandal, Mr Galliano has attended rehab for alcoholism and carried out a temporary residency at Oscar de la Renta, where he received rave reviews for his contribution to the designer's fall 2013 show.
