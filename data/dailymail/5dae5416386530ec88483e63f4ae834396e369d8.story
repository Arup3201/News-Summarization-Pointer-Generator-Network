The giant panda cub born two weeks ago at Smithsonian's National zoo in Washington is a female, who was fathered by the zoo's own panda Tian Tian.

DNA samples were taken from the tiny cub, and her fraternal twin which was born dead, to determine the sex and paternity.

The panda's mother, Mei Xiang had been artifically inseminated with sperm from Tian Tian and a second panda, Gao Gao, from San Diego Zoo.

A den check on Thursday morning showed the mother and cub continue to be healthy, senior curator Brandie Smith said.

The cub is starting to develop dark markings in her fur, around the eyes, ears and back.

'It's got a fat little belly,. It's very active, very vocal,' Ms Smith said.

The ten-day mark is critical for the cub's survival. After that point, keepers start to gain more confidence about its health.

'We're finally starting to really celebrate,' she said.

Since the cub was born Mei Xiang has turned down all offers of food, and has been drinking only a little diluted apple juice, which is normal behavior for the species.

A 'panda cam' has been set up in her den so keepers - and the public - can watch the cub's progress.

China owns the pandas, an endangered species, at the Smithsonian's National Zoo. The cub is expected to stay with her mother for a little over two years until she is weaned, and will stay at the zoo for about four years.

Mei Xiang's only other surviving cub, a male named Tai Shan, was born in 2005 and was returned to China in 2010.

The
15-year-old gave birth to a cub last year after several years of failed
breeding, but the cub died after six days. Its lungs hadn't fully 
developed and likely weren't sending enough oxygen to its liver.

The stillborn cub born, a day after its healthy twin, had abnormalities and 'had never been alive,'Â  zoo spokesman Pamela Baker-Masson said in a statement.

'It lay motionless and made no sound. Throughout, staff could see it visually and hear the first cub squealing, and Mei never set it down.'

Zookeepers were able to remove the lifeless cub and saw that the cub suffered abnormalities.

The zoo began performing a necropsy on the stillborn cub which they hope will tell them why the cub stopped developing and died, she said.

When her cub was first born the protective mother only allowed zoo staff close enough to examine it two days later.

Ms Smith compared the 
planned examination to a race car pit stop, a fast and highly choreographed 
checkup before reuniting mother and cub.

The cub's first neonatal exam showed vets it was 'robust, fully formed, 
and is a bright, healthy shade of pink,' tweeted the zoo.

The zoo's account noted that it weighs 137g, which is 
about 4.8oz, and that its heart rate was steady.

Vets were able to hear 
breathing sounds from both lungs and its belly was full, indicating it is nursing.

'All signs are that we have a very healthy, active, vibrant 
cub,' the zoo's account tweeted.
