Payout: Foreign Secretary William Hague announced details of the compensation in the Commons

The UK government is to pay £14million in compensation to  elderly Kenyans tortured by British colonial forces, but Foreign Secretary William Hague today stopped short of issuing an apology.

With legal fees, the total bill for the brutal treatment of  thousands of prisoners tortured and raped under colonial rule will reach almost £20million.

Mr Hague told MPS the the British Government continued to
 deny liability for what happened during the uprising as he only conceded 'we understand the pain and grievance felt by those who were involved'.

Negotiations began after a London court ruled in October that three elderly Kenyans, who suffered castration, rape and beatings 
while in detention during a crackdown by British forces and their Kenyan
 allies in the 1950s, could sue Britain.

The torture took place during the 
so-called Kenyan 'Emergency' of 1952-60, when fighters from the Mau Mau 
movement attacked British targets, causing panic among white settlers 
and alarming the government in London.

In a Commons statement, Mr Hague He said the Government had reached a 
full and final settlement with the solicitors representing the 5,228 
claimants totalling £19.9 million.

The UK Government would also support 
the construction of a memorial in Kenya's capital Nairobi to the victims
 of torture and ill-treatment during the colonial era.

The Foreign 
Secretary said: 'We recognise that British personnel were called upon to
 serve in difficult and dangerous circumstances.

'Many members of the colonial service 
contributed to establishing the institutions that underpin Kenya today 
and we acknowledge their contribution.'

Mr Hague did not go as far as issuing an apology for the scandal, but told MPs: 'I would like to make clear 
now, and for the first time on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, that 
we understand the pain and grievance felt by those who were involved in 
events of the emergency in Kenya.

'The British Government recognises 
that Kenyans were subject to torture and other forms of ill-treatment at
 the hands of the colonial administration. The British Government 
sincerely regrets that these abuses took place and they marred Kenya's 
progress towards independence.

'Torture and ill-treatment are abhorrent violations of human dignity which we unreservedly condemn.'

The victims' lawyers said the Government has agreed damages for thousands mistreated in the Mau Mau rebellion from 1952-60.

It came after ministers’ dramatic confession last year that officials and Kenyan allies did commit atrocities.

'We have agreed on an out-of-court settlement,' Kenyan lawyer Paul Muite, an advisor to the Mau Mau veterans seeking compensation, said.

'(The negotiations) have included everybody with sufficient evidence of torture. And that number is about 5,200,' he said, declining to comment on the size of the payout.

This payments work out at about £2,600 - 
or 339,560 Kenyan shillings - per claimant in a country where average 
national income per capita is around 70,000 shillings.

The
 Mau Mau nationalist movement originated in the 1950s among the Kikuyu 
people of Kenya. Its loyalists advocated violent resistance to British 
domination of the country.

The Kenya Human Rights Commission has estimated 90,000 Kenyans were killed or maimed and 160,000 detained during the uprising.

London tried for three years to block the Mau Mau veterans' legal action in the courts, drawing condemnation from the elderly torture victims who accused Kenya's former colonial master of using legal technicalities to fight the case.

Caroline Elkins, a Harvard history professor who acted as an expert witness in the case launched in 2009, said the settlement would be the first of its kind for the former British Empire.

'(It) should be seen as a triumph,' Elkins said during a visit to Nairobi for the British announcement.

Elkins wrote the book 'Imperial Reckoning: The Untold Story of Britain's Gulag in Kenya' which served as the basis for the Mau Mau case.

Britain had first said that responsibility for events during the Mau Mau uprising passed to Kenya upon its independence in 1963, an argument which London courts rejected.

The government then said the claim was brought long after the legal time limit. But a judge in October's ruling said there was ample documentary evidence to make a fair trial possible.
