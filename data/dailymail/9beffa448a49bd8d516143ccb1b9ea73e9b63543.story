A pensioner who manufactured fake detectors which he claimed could locate ivory, bombs and even help find missing Madeleine McCann, has been jailed for three and a half years.

Samuel Tree, 68, had the devices made China before assembling them in his garden shed in Dunstable, Bedford, along with his wife, Joan, 62, who was given a suspended two year jail sentence.

The couple were the final pair to be found guilty in a fraud case stretching back to 1999 which is thought to have netted a gang of con artists up to £80million.

The crooks claimed the detectors could locate oil, drugs, and explosives up to three miles away, when in fact the devices were nothing more than empty plastic boxes filled with shredded paper.

Samuel Tree, 68, has been jailed for three and a half years after being found guilty of selling fake the fake detectors, which his wife Joan, 62 (right) was given a suspended two year sentence

The couple claimed the detector, known as Alpha 6, could help find bombs, drugs, ivory and even missing people such as Madeleine McCann, while in fact it was an empty box filled with shredded paper

The device came with a label attached to it listing the item it was supposed to look for, and the Trees claimed it used the body's static electricity to power an aerial which would point to the object.

Despite the 'Alice in Wonderland' science behind the device, known as Alpha 6, the Egyptian government placed an order worth £1million, while Thai officials paid £25,000 for a single unit.

The device even duped Giles Paxman, brother of journalist Jeremy Paxman, who championed it while he was the UK's ambassador to Mexico. 

Units of Alpha 6 were bought by Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan, China, and were also sold for use in the Green Zone in Iraq while British troops were serving there.

Passing sentence on the Trees at Kingston Crown Court, Judge Richard Marks QC said: ‘You decided to market this device along with the other defendants previously convicted.

‘Thereafter you commissioned the device’s production in China, where the cost of an individual piece was just over £5.

‘You had the device stamped "Made in Britain", which in my view is plainly dishonest.

‘The device underwent various name changes over the years, but for all practical purposes it was the same thing.

‘The modest production cost is a reflection of the fact that this device was effectively a black plastic box, one similar to what might look like a small radio. 

The 'sensor' had a label on the front listing the item it was supposed to detect, and the Trees claimed the body's static electricity powered an antenna which would point towards the object being looked for

Despite the 'Alice in Wonderland' science behind the device, the gang of crooks that the Trees were part of managed to sell them to governments in Saudi Arabia, Thailand, China, Egypt, India and Pakistan

At Kingston Crown Court, Judge Richard Marks gave Joan Trees a suspended sentence after hearing that she would not have been involved in the scam if it weren't for her husband, but will likely still lose her house

‘The way in which it worked was that a piece of card or paper would be attached to it, an image reflecting what it was proposed to be looking for.

‘The aerial would then point to the vicinity or direction of the person or object being searched for.

‘One only has to look at the bare facts to see this as a bizarre and fantastic proposition akin to something out of Alice in Wonderland.

‘This device was completely ineffectual. The basis on which it worked was a complete fantasy.

‘Even if you had not written line by line your own sales literature, the most customary glance at it would had put you on notice that all manner of scientific claims were mad.

‘That you decided not to sell the products in this country and not expose it to closer scrutiny, suggests a great deal about your motives.’ 

Fellow swindler Jim McCormick, 58, from Langport in Somerset was jailed for ten years last May after raking in £60million from the scam.

Gary Bolton, also 58, from Chatham, Kentwas given seven years last August after making £45million, while Anthony Williamson, 59, from Gosport, Hampshire, was also convicted last May.

Brendan Kelly QC, defending Samuel Tree, said: ’It is agreed that Mr Tree played a significant role in this offending, there can be no doubt argument about that.

While the Trees sold the detector under the moniker Alpha 6 (far right, top) it was also sold in variations called XK9, GT200 and The Mole (pictured), which were all effectively the same product

The Alpha 6 model, which was sold by the Trees, consisted of a plastic box with an aerial attached, which would be filled with shredded paper, and cost just £5.10 to manufacture

The couple bought the items, which were falsely stamped 'Made in Britain', from China before selling them on for up to £25,000 to foreign governments

‘Mr Tree is content for me to say on his behalf that the role played by Mrs Tree herself is substantially different to his.

‘I submit on his behalf that had it not been for him she would not have involved herself in this plot.’

Judge Marks added: ‘Financially this case will be disastrous for you because it will inevitably mean that you will lost all of your assets.’

The court heard that the Trees will likely lose their £180,000 house and £10,000 at a confiscation hearing set for 27 February 2015.

Joan Tree was also ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid community work.

Judge Marks QC concluded: ‘Joan Tree, you are in a significantly different situation to the one of your husband in my view.

‘It is undoubtedly the case that you played a significantly lesser role.

‘You were concerned with assisting your husband, not marketing or selling like him or in training.

‘You were, I am satisfied, acting under direction from your husband and would not have become involved in this situation had it not been for him.

‘I have given anxious consideration as to whether there is scope for suspending your sentence, and I have by the narrowest of margins decided that by this lesser role this is just possible.

‘You should consider yourself extremely fortunate as you have come as close to anyone to receiving a custodial sentence.’ 

The devices were even sold to Iraqi authorities while British troops were serving in the county

Detective constable Joanne Law, who led the investigation for the City of London Police, said: ‘Sam and Joan Tree were a couple driven by personal greed.

They manufactured useless detectors which they knew were being marketed around the world as being able to locate anything from hidden explosives to missing persons.

‘The devices cost the couple only a few quid to make but were being sold on by agents for prices ranging from several thousand to half a million pounds, despite the fact they were nothing more than plastic boxes with a handle and antennae.

‘The sentencing of the Trees is the concluding act in a highly complex investigation into a global criminal network, which over a ten-year period turned-over up to £80 million. 

'Thousands of false substance detectors were produced and sold putting both the users and the people they were bought to protect in grave danger.

‘The demise of these individuals sends a strong warning to anyone else who believes they can make criminal capital abroad while trading off the good name of British business.’
