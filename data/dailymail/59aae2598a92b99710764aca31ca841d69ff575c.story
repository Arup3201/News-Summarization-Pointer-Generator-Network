A mother of twins has told how shocked she was when her seven-year-old boys managed to rack up a $3,000 iTunes bill, despite doing it through a free iPad app.

Paula Marner from St John's, Canada, was on a trip to the UK and had left her sons Elias and Malachy at home with her iPad, so they could play Clash of Clans, an app she had downloaded for free.

According to CBC news, after just ten days, the boys inadvertently maxed out her credit card and amassed a whopping $3,000 in charges - simply by typing in her iTunes login password while playing the game.

Expensive: Paula Marner from St John's, Canada, gave her sons Elias and Malachy her iPad to play with while she was away. They inadvertently bought $3,000 worth of game features by making in-app purchases

Innocent mistake: The boys (pictured) thought they were doing nothing wrong, since their parents had simply told them never to download an app without permission

At first, Ms Marner assumed that the charges meant there had been 'fraudulent or criminal activity' on her card from the UK.

But in fact, it was her seven-year-olds playing the game - which is one of the highest grossing iPad apps of all time - while she was away.

The boys apparently typed in Ms Marner's iTunes password, and were then prompted to buy game features like tokens and gems which ranged in price from 99 cents to $99.

Beneath the purchase options in the app, a small banner reads: '(Costs real money)'.

'That kept coming up consistently and they kept tapping it, because it's just tap purchase, tap purchase, tap purchase,' said the angered mother.

She admits the it was her mistake for
giving her sons the Apple iTunes password, which they had to use each 
time they logged in to play the game.

Still, the boys thought they were 
doing nothing wrong, since their parents had simply told them never
to download an app without permission.

Backlash: Apple is giving Ms Marner a full refund for the purchases made, but some parents have decided to sue the company in a lawsuit that may cost up to $100million

According to CBC News, Apple is giving Ms Marner a full refund for the purchases made.

The mother's experience with an outrageous bill due to in-app purchasing is hardly unique.

In September, a six-year-old boy from
North Yorkshire, England, unwittingly charged £2,000 to his 
grandfather's credit card by buying features within an app called Tiny 
Monsters.

Like Clash of Clans, the game was free for the boy to download, but acquiring virtual food and coins within the app cost up to £70 each.

The family, who also received a refund from Apple, only discovered the costly bill when the boy's grandmother had her credit card declined at a grocery store.

Apple is also currently in the process of settling a lawsuit filed by five parents who claim to have had similar experiences with in-app purchases.

The lawsuit could apparently cost the company up to $100million.
