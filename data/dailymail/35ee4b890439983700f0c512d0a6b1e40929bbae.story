Councils across the UK have spent more than £7.2m on charging points for electric cars over the last three years but many are not being used.

One in six councils admitted to having at least one point which has not been used at all over the past year.

While less than a third of authorities have a charging point used on average more than once a week, more than half of which are used only by council vehicles.

Councils across the UK have spent more than £7.2m on charging points for electric cars in three years

BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours found that council spending amounts to £1,750 per electric car.

Answers to Freedom of Information requests from 91 per cent of councils in the UK revealed that 139 had spent £7.21m on charging points between them since April 2010.

Twenty-five of the councils (18 per cent) said they had at least one point not used at all between April 2012 and April 2013, while 41 (29 per cent) councils had a point used more than 52 times over the same 12 months.

Prof David Bailey, a transport expert at Coventry University Business School, told You and Yours: 'At the moment there are hardly any electric cars on the road.

'There are more charging points than there are electric cars.

'Much more effort needs to go into stimulating the demand side and educating people so that they know how to use these cars.'

Figures from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency show there are 4,100 electric cars in the UK.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers are clearly being fleeced to fund what is little more than an attempt by the councils involved to brandish their green credentials.

'When only around four thousand of the 34.6 million vehicles on the road are electric cars, this amounts to a very expensive vanity project.

'In any case, since the cars are only suited to travelling short distances, their owners should expect to charge them at home or at their workplace: it’s not fair for them to land already hard-pressed taxpayers with a whopping bill to subsidise their expensive choice of vehicle.'

In February the Government announced an extra £37 million to offset the cost of installing infrastructure for recharging electric vehicles, which will be made available to hospitals, local authorities and train operators to provide charging points.

But the Local Government Association said investment has to be made in charging points.

A spokesman said: 'You have to invest in the charging infrastructure before people start using it. 

'Electric cars are a huge future international market. One barrier to that market taking off is the limited range before a car needs recharging, so investment in charging points is a vital precondition to this low carbon, sustainable and potentially hugely profitable market of the future.'

'No one is pretending that everything can change overnight' Department for Transport spokesman

The Government and motoring groups also warned that the electric car revolution would take time.

A Department for Transport (DfT) spokesman said: 'No one is pretending that everything can change overnight.

'The Government is putting serious investment into the UK low emissions vehicles sector, including for electric cars.

'We are seeing encouraging growth in the number of people using electric cars - for example there were 966 claims for the plug-in car grant in April-June 2013, almost double the number seen in the same quarter of the previous year - but no one is pretending that everything can change overnight.

'That is why we are continuing to invest in the infrastructure that will support take up of this new technology across the country, including the charging points announcements we made yesterday.'

The spokesman continued: 'Our goal is to ensure that the automotive industry in the UK can build on its recent success with clear support for investment in research and development and continue to make a major contribution to tackling the challenges of 21st century motoring.'

Edmund King, president of AA, said he did not think the charging points were waste of time. 

He said: 'These things take time. At the moment, most people with electric cars charge them at home or at work. There is certainly a role for electric cars to play and I think their price will come down.

'We do need a mix of cars in the UK. Most two-car households could get by with an electric cart. We need to change attitudes.'
