Arsenal have opened talks with Anderlecht over exciting young striker David Henen.

The 18-year-old, who was on loan at Monaco last season, is tipped to make as big an impact as countryman Adnan Januzaj and has been tracked by Manchester United and City.

Rising star: David Henen is on the verge of signing for Everton from Anderlecht for £1.5million

Versatile: The 18-year-old Belgian is usually a striker but can also be used on either wing

The forward, who can play on either flank as well as up front, is extremely quick and has represented Belgium at youth levels, where his goalscoring record is impressive.

Arsenal are looking to pay around £1million and may loan him back to Anderlecht on completion of the deal.
