A Scandinavian men's underwear brand named Comfyballs simply will not fly in America, says the U.S. Patent and Trade Office.

The agency has denied the Norwegian company's application to register the trademark in the U.S., calling the name 'vulgar.'

The company was born in 2013 and quickly moved to the UK, New Zealand and Australia where it promises its underwear--designed with PackageFront technology--reduces heat while allowing for freer movement.

Vulgar? A Norwegian brand of men's underwear called Comfyballs was denied a U.S. trademark for its name when the U.S. patent office called it 'vulgar'

According to the agency's response to the application, the trademark could have gone through had it been slightly funnier.

'The mark does not create a double entendre or other idiomatic expression,' they wrote. 'When used in this way, the word, ‘balls’ has an offensive meaning.'

As the Telegraph notes, another trademark--this one from an American company--had previously been denied by the agency for a similar reason.

Undaunted: The company's founder says he'll petition for a review of the decision and cites other similar trademarks such as 'Nice Balls' and I Love My Balls' that have been allowed through the process

Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavor Schweddy Balls--so named after a well-known Saturday Night Live sketch--saw only a short-lived release in 2011 after the agency blocked a trademark for its name.

On the Comfyballs website, a typical pair of the garments costs 298.00 krone.

While the site does not appear to ship Comfyballs stateside just yet, that's around 40 U.S. dollars. 

The company's undaunted founder Anders Selvig has asked for a review of the patent office's decision and notes similar trademarks that have been allowed through the process.

'"Nice Balls" and "I love my balls" have recently both been approved by the USPTO,' he said. 'Luckily, Europeans have a softer view on what is deemed to be vulgar and the EU allowed Comfyballs to trademark without hassle earlier this year.' 

Should have been funnier: The USPTO said the trademark also 'does not create a double entendre or other idiomatic expression'

The  brand has spread to Australia, New Zealand and the UK but America isn't having it

The agency says the name refers solely to a man's testicles and 'does not create a double entendre' -- and is therefor vulgar

Ben & Jerry's Schweddy Balls brand ice cream was also blocked by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
