Craig Bellamy has returned to Cardiff City as an academy coach.

The Welshman, 35, has ambitions to manage and previously claimed he was offered the top job at Cardiff after Malky Mackay was sacked in 2013.

He left the club in the summer after their relegation to the Championship, but is now working with prospects between the ages of 12 and 18.

'Our Under 12s and Under 13s in particular enjoy working with Craig and he enjoys working with them,' said academy manager James McCarthy.

'Craig has come in over the last few weeks and helped out with teams from Under 12 to Under 18. The young players have so much respect for him.

'During his first week back at the club he ran a finishing session with our Under 12 and Under 13 strikers, including one-on-one situations.

'In the next match one youngster scored a hat-trick against Swansea City and two of the goals came from moves Craig had worked on with him. He has been exceptional.

'Craig is working with us because he wants to become a better coach. Working with our young players and planning sessions helps him with that. He cares about the game and this football club.'
