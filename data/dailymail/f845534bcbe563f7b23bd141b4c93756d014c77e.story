An American anchor who quit her job at state-funded Russia Today on air to protest President Vladimir Putin sending troops into the Ukraine has said she 'feels sick' that she worked at the station.

Liz Wahl, who works at RT's Washington, DC bureau, said in her live resignation that she could no longer work for a network that 'whitewashes the actions of Putin'.

She has now further explained her reasons for quitting the channel, saying it is 'not a sound news organization, not when your agenda is making America look bad.'

Connecticut-born Liz Wahl who sensationally quit her job at state-funded Russia Today on air earlier this month has spoken out for the first time about her bold decision and how the channel's coverage of events in Ukraine that was the final straw for her

Putin has justified the incursion into 
Crimea as a way of protecting ethnic-Russians in the region who he says 
are threatened by 'ultra-nationalistic forces' as the country undergoes 
revolution.

In her resignation, Wahl spoke about how personal the recent developments in the Ukraine are to her. Wahl's grandparents emigrated to the United States from Hungary during that country's revolution in 1956 because of the threat of Soviet forces.

'I'm proud to be an American and believe in disseminating the truth. And that is why after this news cast I'm resigning,' Wahl signed off.

In an interview with the Daily Beast, Wahl said the Kremlin's influence over RT was not overt but 'in order to succeed there you don't question'.

She said: 'In a way you kind of suppress any concerns that you have and play the game.'

Wahl goes on to say: 'It actually makes 
me feel sick that I worked there. It’s not a sound news organization, 
not when your agenda is making America look bad.'

Wahl has accused the state-funded Russia Today of deliberately smearing America in order to make the Kremlin - and Putin - look good

Second: Wahl's resignation happened after fellow American RT anchor Abby Martin spoke out on TV to say the incursion on Crimea was 'wrong'

Following Wahl's resignation, the network responded with a statement posted on their website.

'When
 a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her 
organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances 
with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a 
professional. But when someone makes a big public show of a personal 
decision, it is nothing more than a self-promotional stunt. We wish Liz 
the best of luck on her chosen path,' the statement read.

But Wahl isn't the first American to call out RT.

On Tuesday, anchor Abby Martin also spoke out against the Crimean incursion on the network.

'I
 can't say enough how strongly I am against any state intervention in a 
sovereign nation's affairs. What Russia did is wrong,' Martin said.

After
 that outburst, Martin's bosses told the National Journal that they 
would be sending her to Crimea 'to give her an opportunity to make up 
her own mind from the epicenter of the story'.

After the story was published, Martin responded on Twitter, saying she would not be going to the Crimea, despite RT's statement.

As of Wednesday, Martin is still employed at the network.
