A grieving father discovered that senior hospital staff dealing with the investigation into his baby's death exchanged 'deeply offensive' emails celebrating the end of his quest for justice.

James Titcombe wrote to tell staff at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust (UHMBT) that he was 'stepping back' from his personal investigations in the death of nine-day-old son Joshua in November 2008.

He found that Angela Peil, who worked in customer services at the trust, greeted the news by emailing Angela Oxley, head of midwifery, writing: 'Good news regarding James T'.

Mrs Oxley replied: 'Has JT moved to Thailand? What is the good news?'

Mr Titcombe, whose wife Hoa is from Vietnam, unearthed the emails as part of a Freedom of Information request.

He feels his case may have become confused with that of fellow grieving father, Carl Hendrickson, whose wife, Nittaya, and newborn son, Chester, died in the FGH maternity unit in 2008.

Mr Hendrickson, whose wife was from Thailand, is currently involved in legal action with UHMBT.

Mr Titcombe said: 'It hints at an underlying prejudice.'

UHMBT interim chairman, Sir David 
Henshaw, said: 'We expect all staff to act in a respectful, sensitive 
and professional manner at all times and any behaviour that does not 
meet these standards is completely unacceptable.

'On discovering this information last 
week, the trust launched an internal investigation into the matter and 
will report the outcomes directly to the Titcombe family.'

Joshua Titcombe bled to death after picking up an infection from his mother. His parents asked medics if their newborn son needed to be treated too after they discovered his mother's illness but were told it was unnecessary.

He was airlifted to two different hospitals over the course of the next nine days and died in Newcastle Freeman Hospital on November 5 2008.

Police launched an investigation into standards at the Furness General Hospital last September after the deaths of babies including Joshua.

The labour ward was threatened with closure by the Care Quality Commission unless it improved.

At his son's inquest, Mr Titcombe said that NHS staff had also informed them a paediatrician was 'too busy' to examine Joshua.

Joshua, who suffered a lung infection 
and bled to death, would have had a 80 per cent chance of survival if 
given antibiotics immediately after his birth, the inquest heard.

Coroner Ian Smith accused the midwives who cared for Joshua of a cover-up and collaborating over their failure to recognise a sign that the baby had an infection.

The inquest ruled that Joshua died of 'natural causes following a number of missed opportunities to identify he was ill and to provide him with appropriate treatment', but identified 10 failures by NHS staff leading up to it.

The coroner accused staff of a cover-up and collaborating to hide mistakes over his care.

Ian Smith said 'it was not beyond the balance of possibility' that the observation sheet, recording measurements such as his temperature, had been destroyed, 'and if that was done it can only have been done deliberately'. However, he conceded there was no proof this was the case.

This is not the first time hospital staff have been caught making inappropriate comments in correspondence regarding Joshua’s case.

Last year, it was revealed a midwife involved in an investigation into Joshua’s death sent her colleague a report intended for the Nursing and Midwifery Council - entitling her email 'NMC S**t'.

Mr Titcombe said the latest email exchange is 'deeply offensive and hurtful' but 'sadly typical' of the attitude towards his son’s death.

He said: 'To be honest it’s what I expected. It’s how it’s been all along.

'After Joshua died, I was fighting for answers and I was viewed as an issue - a problem they wanted to go away.'

Mr Titcombe has vowed to fight on.

He said: 'Going through this has been an absolute nightmare - and you’re torn between not wanting to give up on the truth and the impact it has on you.

'My family and I have no intention of moving to Thailand or Vietnam and we will continue to do everything possible to expose the full truth.

'We want to ensure that Barrow maintains a full, consultant-led maternity service that provides a safe level of care.

'We are calling for an independent inquiry to ensure the NHS as a whole learns from these events.'
