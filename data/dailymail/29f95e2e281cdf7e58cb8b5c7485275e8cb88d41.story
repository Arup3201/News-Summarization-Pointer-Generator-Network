An Ohio man who confessed in an online 
video to causing a fatal wrong-way crash after a night of heavy drinking today changed his plea to guilty.

Matthew Cordle, 22, pleaded guilty 
to aggravated vehicular homicide and operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol at a hearing in 
Franklin County Court.

He faces two to eight-and-a-half years in prison at sentencing,
which was set for October 10.

Cordle, who lives in Powell, a Columbus 
suburb, said little during Wednesday's hearing, simply replying, 'Yes, 
your honor', as the judge asked him a series of questions.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Hearing: Judge David W. Fais questions Matthew Cordle, not seen, about the night of the fatal accident when Vincent Canzani was killed in a DUI crash

Victim: Vincent Canzani was 61 at the time of 
his death (pictured recently at right) and previously served in the Navy
(seen in his uniform in an undated photo at left)

He wanted to plead guilty to make good 
on his pledge to accept responsibility for the crash, according to his 
lawyers. They did not ask for him to be released on bond before 
sentencing, and a judge revoked his bond.

In a three-and-a-half minute video posted two weeks 
ago, Cordle admitted he killed a man from another Columbus suburb and 
said he 'made a mistake' when he decided to drive that night.

'My name is Matthew Cordle, and on June 
22, 2013, I hit and killed Vincent Canzani,' he says somberly. 'This 
video will act as my confession.'

He had entered a preliminary plea of not
guilty last week in a procedural move, but the judge didn't allow 
Cordle to go ahead with it, saying his lawyers didn't follow court 
procedures for first appearances.

Franklin County Judge Julie Lynch also
alleged the attorneys balked at coming before her because she wouldn't 
promise a specific sentence, something they deny.

Lynch took Cordle's not guilty plea in a
brief hearing the next day and set a combined $255,000 bond. Cordle 
appeared Wednesday before veteran Franklin County Judge David Fais.

After last week's hearing, Canzani's 
daughter told a TV station the attention the case has gotten is forcing 
her to relive what happened.

Angela Canzani told WCMH-TV in Columbus 
that people seem to forget a person died.

Video confession: The 3.5 minute video starts out with his face blurred and voice altered as he explains how he was driving drunk when he killed someone

Moment of truth: Matthew Cordle identifies himself when the effects are taken away and says that he will plead guilty to any charges that he faces stemming from the June 22 accident

His pledge: Cordle, 22, said that he was fully aware of the legal implications of making the video

The video was filmed on September 3, and the 
version posted on YouTube has been viewed more than 2 million times.

It begins with Cordle's face blurred as he describes how he has 
struggled with depression and was simply trying to have a good time with
friends going 'from bar to bar' the night of the accident.

He then 
describes how he ended up driving into oncoming traffic on Interstate 
670. Cordle's face becomes clear as he reveals his name and confesses to
killing Canzani.

He ends the video by pleading with viewers not to drink and drive.

'I can't bring Mr. Canzani back, and I can't erase what I've
done, but you can still be saved. Your victims can still be saved,' Cordle
says.

Then a message appears on the darkened screen: 'Make the promise to never
drink and drive.'

The victim's daughter spoke out against Cordle, saying that the reason he made the confession publicly was so that he could try to get a lighter prison sentence.

Angela Canzani believes Matthew Cordle, who says he hit and killed Vincent Canzani, 61, on June 22 in, was ‘totally misleading’ with his confession because he was already suspected of the crime.

‘There was a traffic cam. There was a 
third car involved,’ Canzani told NBC News. ‘So people are kind of 
looking at this like he’s just coming out of nowhere…Like he’s some hero
or something.’

But on Friday, the
ex-wife of Mr Canzini told MailOnline she 'applauded' the decision of 
Cordle - who now faces criminal charges brought by the county prosecutor.

Cordle
says in the video he 'made a mistake' when he decided to drive his 
truck home after 'drinking heavily' and hit the other car, killing Mr 
Canzani, of suburban Columbus.

An obituary for Mr Canzani says that he served as a missile technician for a submarine from 1980 to 1986.

Since leaving the Navy, he flourished 
as 'a gifted photographer' and was survived by two daughters and three 
great grandchildren.

The video was released in conjunction with a not-for-profit start up called Because I Said I Would, which is focused around having individuals make commitments to themselves and their goals using index cards.

Its website says that it aims to become a 'a social movement dedicated to bettering humanity through the power of a promise'.

The organization was founded by Alex Sheen who was inspired by his father, who died of lung cancer last September. At his father's funeral, they handed out promise cards in tribute to how his father always kept his promises.

In a message that was posted on the group's website when the confession video was published, Mr Sheen says that Mr Cordle was the one to reach out to him via Facebook message about the hit-and-run.

'After getting to know Matt, I can say with confidence that he truly regrets his decision that night. He describes the guilt he has as “insurmountable,”' Mr Sheen wrote in the post.

'Against all legal advice, Matthew decided to make this video and release it prior to any charges being filed against him. His goal is to raise awareness about the terrible consequences that drunk driving can have on innocent people.'

Cordle's confession is not the only high-profile action the group has been involved with. 

After the three young women were 
discovered in Ariel Castro's Cleveland home, Mr Sheen was moved to 
launch a ten-day walking campaign across the state in their honor.

Movement: The group's founder, Alex Sheen (seen closest to the camera) was inspired to go on a 10-day state-wide walk to raise awareness for sexual abuse victims after DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight were found

Big finish: He ended the walk by being greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother at the site of the 'House of Horrors', which is just six miles away from where Sheen lives

He said that he lives six miles away from the now-razed 'House of Horrors' and was moved by the girls' perseverance.

He used the walk as a way to raise awareness about sexual assault, and at the end, he was greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother.

Mr Sheen gave her a number of t-shirts with the organization's name printed on them, and in return, she later sent him a picture of Gina wearing the shirt.
