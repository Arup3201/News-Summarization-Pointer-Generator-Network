A sinkhole between two houses in a sprawling Florida retirement community that was plugged over the weekend appears to be opening again.

Authorities said Wednesday that the hole has expanded from 25 feet wide and 50 feet deep to 60 feet wide and 70 feet deep. Safety crews are on scene.

Rich Corr lives next door to the house which had been at the center of the sinkhole drama. He told The Villages Daily Sun that he and his wife are packing their bags.

Hole in the ground: A sinkhole expanded Saturday, threatening to engulf two homes in the Villages, Florida. Pictured above over the weekend.

Over the weekend, repair crews filled 
the sinkhole after neighbors noticed it was growing and alerted 
authorities. At that time, a Tampa firm had been working on the sinkhole
 for about three weeks.

District Public Safety Battalion Chief Pete Carpenter said Saturday the sinkhole expanded under the foundations of both houses.

Luckily
 both homes are currently vacant. One of the owners is in Alabama while 
the other is a rental property and the tenants were scheduled to move 
out Saturday.

Firefighters
 were called to the home around 9am on Saturday and crews have since 
been working around the clock to stabilize the hole.

At one point on Saturday, five cement trucks lined the street to fill the hole with a sand and cement mixture and authorities at first seemed hopeful they would stop the hole from growing.

'The house isn't going to go anywhere, 
as long as the hole doesn't move much past where it is right now,' 
geologist Drew Glasbrenner told Fox 35.

'You can never know for sure but the repair should slow it down and eventually stop it from expanding,' he added.

Neighbors
 in the community gathered on the streets Saturday to watch as crews 
attempted to fill the hole and stop it from spreading into the street.

'I
 think it's terrible, I do. I think it's terrible. But this is The 
Villages and we take care of each other,' resident Linda Wiernasc told WKMG.
