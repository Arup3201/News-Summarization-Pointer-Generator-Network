A student recorded vice principal Joseph Defillipo having a discussion with one student and saying: 'I just don't like the black kids'

A school vice-principal has been suspended after making a racist remark which was caught on video.

Joseph Defillipo from Scandinavian Middle School in Fresno, California, was recorded by a student's cellphone, saying: 'I just don't like the black kids.'

Defillipo had been in the middle of a discussion with several students about who he didn't like at the school.

The 20-second clip cuts off after the teacher's racially-insensitive comment.  

The vice principal has taught in the district for 18 years and has been at the middle school since 2010. 

The video was posted to YouTube on Friday where it has been watched more than 4,000 times. 

It was brought to the school's attention by a parent of the student involved.  

Scandinavian Middle School refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online on Wednesday. 

Daily Mail Online was also waiting on a comment from the school district.  

In a statement to Daily Mail Online on Wednesday the school said Defillipo had been put on paid administrative leave while an third-party, external investigation took place. 

A school statement read: 'Fresno Unified takes great pride in providing a positive learning environment for all students and staff. The interaction between the Scandinavian student and our employee has been brought to our attention and we are conducting an investigation.

'Fresno Unified takes this matter very seriously and we will take any necessary actions pending the results. During our investigation, and as a matter of practice, the employee is on paid administrative leave.' 

Several parents whose children attend Scandinavian Middle School told The Fresno Bee that they want Defillipo fired.

A group of former students gathered outside the school premises on Tuesday to protest, chanting: 'I love black people' and 'black power'. 

Around 10 per cent of students at Scandinavian Middle School are black, The Fresno Bee reported. 

The vice principal earns around $87,000 a year, according to public records.

The YouTube video attracted a number of comments, both attacking and in defense of the senior teacher. 

One commenter, Kevin Hill, wrote: 'I'd withhold any judgment until the rest of the video comes out. First, he was talking to black mids [sic], most likely joking, inappropriate, yeah but not racist. Second, the way the video cuts immediately out indicates that there was more said which in context would've shown he was joking.'

Alyssa Hochstetler wrote: 'why would he say that? im so glad i left that school.'
