Lucy Richards was diagnosed with the rare womb disorder placenta previa while pregnant with her daughter Demi

A young mother was forced to have a hysterectomy at just 21 after suffering a rare womb disorder which caused severe bleeding during her pregnancy.

Doctors feared nine times that Lucy Richards would miscarry her baby, before her daughter was delivered safely via C-section.

She lost six pints of blood and drifted out of consciousness as her daughter Demi was born.

At 36 weeks pregnant, doctors diagnosed Miss Richards with the condition placenta previa.

This is where the placenta grows into the lower part of the womb, causing heavy bleeding. 

As doctors delivered her baby, the condition caused her womb to begin to disintegrate, leaving surgeons no option other than to perform a hysterectomy.

Without the drastic operation, the 21-year-old would not have survived to raise her daughter.  

She said: 'I had always dreamed of having a big family. I wanted four kids.

'Giving birth was traumatising and I lost my womb during labour.

'I can never have any more children, but one smile from my beautiful daughter is enough to make me realise that it was all worth it.'

Miss Richards, from Warrington, became pregnant when she was 19 years old.

She conceived despite using the contraceptive pill and the morning after pill. 

She said: 'At that time I had no plans to start a family. I knew I would have plenty of time to have babies, so I was in no rush to get pregnant.'

Miss Richards discovered she was pregnant only when she was rushed to hospital after she began bleeding uncontrollably at work.

Doctors told her she was five weeks pregnant and in the midst of suffering a miscarriage. 

She said: 'I was terrified. I'd been in a meeting and I suddenly started bleeding. I was completely shocked when they told me I was pregnant.'

Doctors were able to save her unborn child and bring the bleeding under control. 

But over the next 14 weeks the expectant mother suffered the early stages of a miscarriage another eight times.

Miss Richards said: 'I didn't know what was happening - but I was terrified I would lose my baby.

'I hadn't planned to have children for another ten years and now I was carrying a little life inside me. 

'As soon as I knew I was having a baby my mothering instinct kicked in and I was determined to fight for it.

'I couldn't even consider having an abortion, she'd been through so much - it was obvious she was desperate to live. It was awful, but eventually I was told the baby was safe and healthy.' 

The 21-year-old did not know she was pregnant and only discovered she was expecting after suffering heavy bleeding at work. Doctors told her she was five weeks pregnant and in the midst of a miscarriage. But they managed to bring the bleeding under control and saved her unborn child's life

At 36 weeks Miss Richards was diagnosed with placenta previa, which causes the placenta to grow in the lower part of the womb causing severe bleeding. As a result doctors said she would need a C-section to deliver her daughter. Miss Richards lost six litres of blood during delivery, forcing doctors to perform a hysterectomy

In April, when she was 36 weeks pregnant, Miss Richards was diagnosed with placenta previa.

The complication, which affects one in 250 labours, causes the placenta to grow into the lower part of an expectant mother's womb, causing vaginal bleeding. 

On April 22, Miss Richards went into labour three weeks early and was rushed into theatre for an urgent Caesarean section.

Placenta previa occurs when the baby's placenta partially or totally covers the opening of the mother's cervix.

The condition can cause severe bleeding before and during labour.

The placenta provides oxygen and nutrients to an unborn baby.

In most pregnancies, it attaches at the top or side of the uterus.

Where a woman is suffering placenta previa, it attaches to the lower area of the placenta.

Sufferers normally require a Caesarean section to safely deliver their baby.

The placenta grows wherever the embryo implants itself in the uterus.

Placenta previa is caused when the embryo implants in the lower part of the womb.

Women are at greater risk of the condition if they have had previous surgeries invloving the uterus, including a C-section or removal of uterine fibroids.

It is also more common in women who have had at least one child, the condition before, women carrying multiple pregnancies, those aged 35 or older, those who smoke and those who use cocaine.

She said: 'Doctors said if I gave birth naturally it would kill me and the baby so I had to have a Caesarean. 

'When my waters broke I was really scared. I went to hospital and doctors rushed me straight into surgery.'

After her daughter was born Miss Richard's slipped in and out of consciousness as she lost nearly six pints of blood.

When she regained consciousness doctors told her that they had attempted to remove her placenta but her womb had started to disintegrate, causing haemorrhaging.

Her placenta had fused itself to her cervix and hip and an emergency hysterectomy was required to save her life.

She said: 'The doctors and surgeons were rushing around me. One told me I would have to have to have my womb removed or I would die.'

After a night in intensive care Miss Richards finally held her daughter Demi Alice Richards.

She said: 'The day I gave birth was the worst day of my life - but the day I finally held my daughter was the best.

'I can hardly put into words what it felt like. She was so tiny and perfect.'

Now six months on, baby Demi said her first word last Thursday.

'Her first word was 'Mama' - it felt awesome to hear,' said Miss Richards.

'I'm lucky to have survived through labour, but the chance to have more children has been taken from me.

'I still have my ovaries so I will look to other options like surrogacy and womb transplants in the future.

'But right now I want to focus on raising the daughter I'm lucky to have.'
