Aspiring police officers have hit out at force chiefs for insisting they study for and pass a new £1,300 certificate before they can start the job.

Police hopefuls - who would previously have been trained on the job - now say they have been put off by new rules which mean they need to spend 300 hours studying before they can even start their official training.

The Certificate in Knowledge of Policing is already a requirement to join six police forces, including the Met, and other forces are considering introducing the new standard.

Barriers: Young people hoping to join the Metropolitan Police, like these new officers pictured at a 'passing out' parade, will need a £1,300 qualification

The College of Policing, which has developed the course, has said it will help make the police 'a true professional service' like medicine or the law.

Under the new system applicants will be sent out to study with external providers who charge between £600 and £1,300 for the course.

One 25-year-old prospective officer, who declined to be named, said there is 'no way' he could afford to splash out on a course which provides only 'basic training'.

The history graduate, who holds a Master's degree from Queen's University Belfast, has already racked up £20,000 of student debt and is not prepared to risk money training for a job he may never get.

He told careers site GraduateFog.co.uk: 'I couldn’t believe it when I saw I’d need a specific qualification – costing up to £1,300.

Diversity? Met Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe, pictured at a ceremony marking the recruitment of new officers, has said he wants to recruit a wider range of people into the force

'The course content seems to be little more than legal theory that I assumed would be considered part of basic training for successful candidates.

'Having had only temporary employment since graduating, I decided not to apply, for the simple reason that if I was rejected, it would be wasted money.

'I graduated with £20,000 of student loans and there is no way I can afford to gamble more money on a job I could be rejected for at any stage.

'I don’t feel it’s fair for the Met to ask for applicants to pay for their own training... they will certainly miss out on other young candidates like me who are worried about money.

'To lots of young people, the £1,300 price tag for the CKP is certainly enough to put us off from applying.'

The course - which will only enable applicants to apply for policing jobs - includes basic policing duties such as how not to misuse their powers, how to search buildings and people and how to conduct interviews.

Labour MP for Mitcham and Morden Siobhain McDonagh is campaigning against the fee.

She said: 'Why should our best, most talented youngsters have to fork out £1,000 for the privilege of joining the police?

And she has set up an e-petition against it.

She added: I'm asking you to sign a petition. Let's get the message through to David Cameron.'

The new requirement comes despite the insistence of Met Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe that the force should try to attract as wide a range of people as possible.

Last week he said he would support a new system in which the organisation would have to take on a new ethnic minority officer for every white officer they take on.

He hopes the change will leave the force 'looking and feeling' more like London - though the force has admitted that the new qualification has the 'potential for adverse impact on individuals from BME (black and minority ethnic) backgrounds.'

The Met Police has said it will 
introduce loans to cover course fees from May, but applicants will have to pass a means test and will only be available for those who already live
 in London.

Tanya de Grunwald, founder of GraduateFog.co.uk said: 'The Government and the Met should admit they have got this policy wrong - it is not fair or right to demand that young applicants stump up such a large amount of money on the off-chance they may be offered a job later.

'Even providing loans won't fix the problem - unsuccessful applicants would still be left out-of-pocket.'

A College of Policing spokesman said: 'The certificate is an excellent grounding in policing and the skills are transferable to other areas of the criminal justice system.

'There are a lot of changes happening in policing at the moment and as part of that, the job of the College of Policing is to professionalise the service. The police are moving in a direction of being a true professional service, similar to other professions such as medicine and law.

'There was nothing in place before the certificate, so now candidates have the chance to educate themselves on policing and take responsibility for their learning.’

A Met Police spokesman said: 'We support any initiative that's about raising standards and competence in policing, and the CKP has a role to play in that.

'Policing is no different from many other professions, in requiring those interested in a career to achieve a specific qualification before joining.'
