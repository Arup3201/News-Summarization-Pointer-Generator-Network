Despite being a  highly-tuned professional athlete, this Premier League footballer has revealed  that, much like the rest of us, even he fancies a kebab (or two!) from time to time.

Pre-season is in full swing and the new campaign kicks off in just over a week's time, but in terms of what he's eating, Cesc Fabregas still appears to be on holiday.

The Chelsea midfielder took to Instagram to post a picture of his double-kebab dinner, saying that: 'A bit of "shawarma" never killed anyone #lebanesefood.'

Let's hope that this particular dietary choice doesn't incur the wrath of new manager Jose Mourinho.

But it is more than likely that his boss will let him off, considering that Mourinho has appeared besotted so far with his £30million signing from Barcelona, indicating that he is the man to help bring success back to Stamford Bridge this season. 

Mourinho said: 'He can accelerate the intensity of the game or he can reduce it. He's very intelligent and he has goals. We are so happy and all the players have a fantastic feeling around him as they really feel that he sees football too fast, too fast.

'I always thought Cesc would be a Barcelona player because he is so good and being a Catalan and with the end of Xavi's career coming. When we heard the information he'd decided to come back to London we knew he was the one we wanted.

'His football brain is what we need in our team. I see him everywhere. His best quality is the speed of how he analyses the game and executes. It is difficult for him to lose the ball or make the wrong decision.'

And the Chelsea boss is particularly impressed with Fabregas’ versatility he brings to the squad.

'He can play as a No 10 and score or a No 8 and give most of his game to the team as we have [Nemanja] Matic as anchorman and [John Obi] Mikel. Then we have Oscar and Willian as No 10s. Cesc is both, he is the missing piece of our engine.'
