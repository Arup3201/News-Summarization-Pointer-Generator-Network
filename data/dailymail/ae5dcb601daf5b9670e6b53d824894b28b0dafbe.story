A bulldog puppy has been saved from nonstop agony by being taken for walkies underwater.

Ronnie was so crippled when he was handed over to vets that he was close to being put down, but has now been nursed back to health and can move around again.

The dog was rescued from an apparently abusive owner when he was four months old, and was completely unable to walk.

Unorthodox: Ronnie the bulldog is taken for a walk in a water tank to help his rehabilitation

The tendons in his front legs had not grown properly because of the terrible diet he was fed, and the American bulldog could only crawl around in constant pain.

Staff at Croeso Veterinary Hospital in Cardiff fell in love with the striking-looking puppy, and decided to rule out putting him down.

'He looked totally sad,' said vet Penny Francais. 'He would just look at us as if to say, "Help me."

'We thought he would never come back from this, but look at him now.'

Experts turned to unorthodox techniques to help Ronnie overcome his rare condition, which is called Carpal Flexural Limb Deformity.

Standing proud: The puppy is recovering from a devastating leg condition caused by a poor diet

Therapy: As well as the underwater treadmill, Ronnie practices dog yoga and undergoes acupuncture

He was fitted with splints which support his walking, and put on a rehabilitation programme including dog yoga which stretches out his tendons and strengthens his legs.

The dog is also given water therapy, which sees him put in a life jacket and placed on an underwater treadmill.

This allows him to take the weight off his legs and walk in greater freedom.

After his workout, Ronnie undergoes 20 minutes of acupuncture which is supposed to relax his muscles and stimulate the bloodflow.

Just three weeks after he began the intensive programme, the dog is already able to place his front feet normally.

Staff hope that in 18 months, once his bones have fully formed, he will no longer need the splints to walk.

Not only has Ronnie recovered his health, he has also found a new home after Croeso nurse Abigail John decided to adopt the puppy.

'We definitely made the right choice,' the 25-year-old said. 'We just want him to have a normal life. We want him to be comfortable and pain free.'
