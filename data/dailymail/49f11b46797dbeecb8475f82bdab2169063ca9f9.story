If you love being outdoors but don't find sitting in the wind, cold, wet or even extreme heat particularly comfortable, have we got an idea for you ....the Casa Bubble.

Put one of these beautiful works of architectural art in your garden and you can feel like you're outdoors all year long, without being bothered by any offensive weather.

Extreme glamping: The Casa Bubble on sandy shores

A room with a view: the inflatable bubble tent has great views

The Bubbles retail at £4,000- £9,300 (see full details at casabubble.com), with rental fees from £900 per night for the basic bubble, up to £2,000 for the 'grand lodge', plus shipping from France.

The dreamy tents were created by two French designers; architect Pierre-Stephane, who lives near Paris, and Frederic Richard, who divides his time between France and the US. The pair designed the houses to create, 'A maximum of pleasure, 
for a minimum of material and energy expenditure'.

Frameless and virtually roofless, the bubbles are inflated by a special turbine which keeps it in shape, renews the air and eliminates pollen, humidity and condensation.

The Casa Bubble comes in three different designs -- from fully transparent (above) to almost fully opaque

Inside, the air is fresh and filtered, there are no mosquitoes and, according to its architects, the acoustics are particularly soothing.

'The original idea comes form my childhood dream to sleep under the Milky Way,' designer Frederic tells MailOnline. 'So that's what Pierre and I decided to do -- but in a much more comfortable way! We wanted to create a cozy hotel bedroom with the starry sky as the ceiling.'

So what does it feel like to sleep in your very own bubble? 'Amazing is the word!' he says.

Being structureless, the bubble needs to 
be inflated permanently in order to support the dome.

The
 air being filtered, the atmosphere inside the dome is almost ten times cleaner than outside. No pollens, no allergens, no dust and no 
mosquitoes either.

There are three different types of bubble. The Cristal Bubble, which is fully transparent, the Bubble Room, which is half opaque and the Bubble Drop, almost fully opaque but with a circular clear window in the roof to allow a view of the sky and stars.

They're also produced in different materials, suitable for different geographic areas, weather and local temperatures.

'The standard bubbles are made of the highest grade of new PVC's. This for standard temperature from 3°C to 50°C,' says Frederic.

'For cold climates, we propose a new TPU (Thermo-Polyurethane) bubble, suitable for temperatures as low as -40°C.

'For very hot countries, we propose our fully opaque Bubble Drop in a material we call sunblock. This material reflects up to 95% of the sun intakes. It's perfect for hot area like deserts when the temperatures are high during the day and very cold at night!

So how long does it take to put up your personal bubble? 'It's easy!' promises Frederic. 'For one person, it will take 50 minutes.'

The Casa Bubbles, which sell to private clients as well as corporates, are environmentally friendly too. They are made of 100 per cent recyclable material and are ethically manufactured

When deflated and packed, a 13ft bubble in its bag will fit on your rear car seat and weighs only 50kg.

And how will they withstand rainy climates? 'I would say that the bubbles are water resistant than water proof,' says Frederic. 'In very bad conditions with prolonged heavy rain some drops may come in. Although we haven't had any complaints so far.'

'And in the heat we recommend finding a relatively shady area and propose using the Sunblock Bubble Drop version.'

Frederic adds, 'Being laid in your queen size bed, under the duvet like in your bedroom and watching the stars, the planes and the satellites crossing the sky is an incredible experience.

'When I stayed in one of these in a wood, so many animals come to see what was going on with this strange flying saucer -- deers, coyotes and raccoons.'

Living in a bubble has never sounded so appealing.
