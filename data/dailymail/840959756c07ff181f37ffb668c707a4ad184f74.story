A mother of one has spent nearly a year-and-a-half trekking thousands of miles across Britain to visit 223 pubs - all called the Red Lion.

But personal trainer Cathy Price, 53, from Preston in Lancashire, is only part way through her quest to visit all 724 Red Lion pubs in Britain - and she's already clocked up a staggering 7,000 miles.

Cathy began her adventure after she popped into the Red Lion pub in Hawkeshead in the Lake District to watch the Grand National on April 9, 2011.

Inside was a sign declaring 'the Red Lion' to be the most common pub name in Britain.

She says of the 15th-century coaching inn: 'It was a lovely little pub and having read the sign, I imagined hundreds of them dotted all over the country.

'I came up with this mad idea of visiting them and then I discovered an app called CaskFinder which I realised could easily help me track down scores of Red Lions.'

At every pub she visits, Cathy poses for a photograph and usually downs her favourite tipple - a half pint of ale.

She’s also collected a huge array of souvenirs from landlords including beer mats, glasses, pub t-shirts and menus. 

The length of her visits vary - from just half an hour in her lunch break to weeks away on trips dedicated to visiting as many Red Lions as possible.

If the pub has its own accommodation, Cathy tries to stay the night to get the 'complete experience'.

So far Cathy’s furthest trip has been from her home in Preston to the Red Lion at Penzance, Cornwall - a 750-mile round trip.

By the time Cathy finishes her pub pilgrimage, she will have visited hostelries as far apart as Aberdeen in the north to Cornwall in the south.

Good progress: The adventure began in April 2011

Cathy is visiting the pubs in no particular order.

'It has given me a great excuse to travel and has improved my geography no end.

'Because the name has a history going back centuries, they tend to be the older buildings in picturesque settings.

A helping hand: Cathy often travels with friends and family on her weekend trips

Cathy has a printed an official list detailing the address of every Red Lion in the UK, which she takes with her on her travels.

She uses a yellow highlighter to cross off the pubs as she visits them.

'But I have sadly found about 10 per cent of them closed when I get there because they have simply gone out of business.

On weekends Cathy will visit several Red Lions, and during the week she sometimes pops out for a swift half at lunch

Keeping trim: Thanks to her job as a personal trainer, Kathy doesn't need to worry about knocking back a few pints and the odd pub lunch

'I call these Dead Lions and cross them off on my list with a red highlighter.

'It’s a sad state of affairs but many pubs are struggling these days.

'Others have re-opened under a different name, such as the Red Lion in Southwark, London, which is now the Walrus.

The dead lions: Cathy sometimes arrives at pubs, only to find they closed long ago

'I try to check opening hours on the internet but if I get there and find the times have changed I have to go back.'

Cathy travels by train or car, sometimes with her daughter, and often with different friends and family members.

'At first, my friends and family thought I was crazy but they have been won over very quickly - now they enjoy travelling with me.

'A bit rough': Cathy will always stay for a photro, even if she doesn't want to linger

'We sometimes turn our visits into a holiday or day trip, stopping over for the night if they have nice accommodation.

'The amount of time we spend at each pub really varies.Some of them are really nice and offer a great lunch but others are a bit rough so we nip in and out.'

'I always have a drink and pose for a photograph to keep as a reminder of my visit.

Make yourself comfortable: On other occasions the committed pub-crawler will stay the night

'Some landlords give me a memento too, such as a beer mat, menu or t-shirt, which I keep in a special file at home.

Cathy varies her drinks, depending on whether she has to drive, but her job as a personal trainer means she doesn't have to worry about downing a few pints of ale.

'Thankfully, I can enjoy the drinks and lunch knowing my work keeps me active and will burn off the calories. I don’t have a beer belly.'

Historic: The popularity of the Red Lion name dates from 1603, when King James I ordered the red lion of the Scottish Royal Arms to be displayed on buildings

Cathy says the most quirky was in Dittisham, Devon, where the pub is also the village post office, souvenir shop, grocery store and bed and breakfast.

She has already visited a Red Lion in Dubai and New York and vows to continue her tour abroad once she has conquered the UK.

'There are also a lot of Red Lions around the world, nearly everywhere there is a large ex-pat community.

Flying the flag: Cathy wants to look further afield for Red Lion pubs in British expat communities

'I hope to visit all of them too.

'I must also book a flight out of Gatwick at some point because they have a Red Lion in their departure lounge.'

Paul Nunny, from Cask Marque, said: 'The British pub is so engrained in our psyche that some people are driven to do these brilliantly unique things.

The lion is very common in coats of 
arms, second only to the cross.

The red lion was a personal badge of John of 
Gaunt, founder of the House of Lancaster whose lands encompassed Cathy's
home town of Preston.

The most common origin is probably 
from the Royal Arms of Scotland. When the crowns of England and Scotland
were united with the accession of James I and VI in 1603, all public 
buildings were ordered to display the red lion as a badge of loyalty to 
the house of Stuart.

According to the British Beer and Pub Association, the eight most popular pub names in the UK are:

'I think what Cathy is doing is fantastic. I hope she achieves her goal of visiting every Red Lion in the world.'

According to the British Beer and Pub Association, the Red Lion is the most common pub name in the country, with a history dating back centuries.

The nearest pub to Downing Street is called the Red Lion and is a popular haunt for MPs.
