Newcastle United recorded a night to remember on Wednesday as Alan Pardew's side earned a place in the Capital One Cup quarter-finals after a 2-0 win against Manchester City.

Goals from Rolando Aarons and Moussa Sissoko ensured the win for the Magpies against a City side which started with Yaya Toure, David Silva and Edin Dzeko.

Here, Sportsmail's Craig Hope gives his verdict on how the players performed at the Etihad.

MANCHESTER CITY: (4-2-3-1)

Willy Caballero 5.5

Nutmegged for the opener and beaten quite easily for the second, did little to press claims for a run in the team.

Bacary Sagna 5.5

Done all ends up for Sissoko’s excellent second and did not get to grips with Aarons all night.

Martin Demichelis 5.5

Dithered when presented with one glorious first-half chance to level.

Eliaquim Mangala 5

Clumsy – he looks anything but a £30million Premier League centre back.

Aleksandar Kolarov 5.5

Struggled to contain Obertan at times and didn’t offer a great deal in attack. Should have been sent off for trip on Obertan in area.

Yaya Toure (centre) struggled to make an impact against a spirited Newcastle midfield

James Milner 6

A frustrating night, he tried his best to make things happen but it just didn’t come off.

Yaya Toure (off 59) 5.5

Just did not impact his superiority yet again, especially against young opponents.

Fernandinho 5

Was guilty of dawdling in possession at the cost of the opening goal.

Fernandinho was caught in possession in the early stages, leading to Newcastle's opener

David Silva was forced off with an injury just nine minutes into the first half

David Silva (off 9)

Injury woe and now a doubt for the derby.

Stevan Jovetic 5

Precious little impact in the final third.

Edin Dzeko 5.5

See Jovetic.

Edin Dzeko failed to make an impact as City struggled against Newcastle

Substitutes

Samir Nasri (on 9 & off 70) 5.5

Floated around the periphery of the game without making any difference.

Jesus Navas (on 59) 5.5

Like all of his team-mates, failed to make a telling impact.

Sergio Aguero (on 70) 6

Too late for him to save the day this time.

Sergio Aguero didn't have enough time to save City after coming on in the 70th minute

NEWCASTLE UNITED: (4-1-4-1)

Rob Elliot 6.5

Relatively untroubled but did what he had to with minimum fuss.

Daryl Janmaat (off 63) 7

Continues to look a class act – just why didn’t want of the bigger boys take a chance on him at £5m?

Fabricio Coloccini 7.5

Another assured performance from the skipper – he is the picture of cool and organised a young backline.

Fabricio Coloccini (left) looked assured at the back and stayed strong throughout

Paul Dummett 7

Switched to centre back from the left and did not look out of place.

Massadio Haidara 7

Offered as much in attack as he did in defence and might just have done enough to keep his place for Liverpool.

Ryan Taylor 8

What a reintroduction after 26 months out – first he crocks Silva and then sets up the opener. An admirable display. MOM.

Mehdi Abeid 7

Was strong in the tackle and crisp with his passing, a solid performance.

Jack Colback 6.5

Knitted play together in the middle of the park without being spectacular.

Gabriel Obertan 7

A willing runner, as ever, and caused problems for Kolarov down the right.

Adam Armstrong 6.5

It wasn’t the easiest of tasks as a lone frontman, but the teenager stuck to it and didn’t afford his minders a moment’s rest.

Rolando Aarons (off 46) 7.5

Terrorised City with his skill and pace and took his goal with the confidence of a seasoned striker, not an 18-year-old rookie.

Aaron terrorised City's defence and scored the opening goal before coming off at half-time

Substitutes

Sammy Ameobi (on 46) 6.5

Followed up his game-changing performance at Spurs with another tricky 45 minutes.

Moussa Sissoko (on 63) 7.5

Was brought on to help see home a 1-0 but made it safe with his quite brilliant second.

Emmanuele Riviere (on 63) 6

Took up the baton from Armstrong.
