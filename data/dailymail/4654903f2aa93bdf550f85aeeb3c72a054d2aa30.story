Though panning for gold might seem like an outdated activity better suited for the rough-and-tumble prospectors of the 19th century, that hasn’t stopped hundreds of people from sifting through gravel and silt, in hopes of striking gold.

But in Colorado, residents who have been prospecting through the state’s rivers and creeks for gold dust could be in for an unfavorable change.

Lawmakers are considering a ban on harvesting of the precious mineral.

Hard day's work: Hours of scooping and sifting often yiled no more than $20 worth of gold dust 

Gold panning has experienced a spike in popularity in part because of shows like ‘Gold Rush’ on the Discovery Channel, which depicts people finding fortune within river basins and streams.

Officials in Larimer County, Colorado, will vote on banning the retrieval of minerals from city land next month, though recreational prospectors said the motion is unnecessary.

‘There are other issues that the county commissioners, I feel, should be devoting their efforts to,’ Darrell Koleber told 9News.

He added that there is little to no gold left in the region. Despite the lack of the precious mineral, many recreational prospectors still sift through mud and sediment – not as a means to gain wealth, but as a pastime.

Chunk of change: Most of the gold prospectors find is barely enough for gas money

He added: ‘I think they’re sticking their nose (sic) in one of the few things we can go out and do and have fun and not spend a lot of money.’

Dan Rieves, the visitor services director for the Department of Natural Resources, told the Denver Post of his organization’s unease.

‘The concern is that we have a patchwork of properties that we manage on someone else’s behalf. The can of worms for us is the mineral rights,’ he told the paper.

The environmental factor, he said, was negligible.

If commissioners do sign off on the rule change, gold hunting in Larimer County would be banned on any land owned by the Department of Natural Resources.

Trend: In 2011, gold prices climbed from $1,388 per ounce to well over $1,700, leveling off by the end of the year at $1,500

Last year, gold prices climbed from $1,388 per ounce to well over $1,700, leveling off by the end of the year at $1,500.

Though the part-time prospectors in Larimer County rarely find even enough gold dust for gas money, many say it’s more the thrill of the chase.

Gold panners may find enough dust to make $20 in a day, after hours of scooping and sifting.

Gold fever: Gold was discovered in Colorado in 1858 outside of present-day Denver, sparking the Pike¿s Peak gold rush

Gold
was discovered in Colorado in 1858, outside of present-day Denver, 
sparking the Pike’s Peak gold rush, creating a fever pitch of excitement
as rumors of abundant wealth ran rampant.

John H. Gregory was the 
first to find large quantities of gold in May of 1859 near Clear Creek.

Back east, men heard stories of Gregory and were quick to respond to 
these reports.

Long after the minerals were gone, ambitious 
prospectors would head out into the rugged landscape to seek their 
fortunes, often selling all of their possessions in hope of finding 
ounces of the precious ore.

Some men kept journals of their plights,
detailing the busy schedule of mining combined with the bitter 
disappointment when little gold was found.
