The former financial officer for the small northern Illinois city of Dixon stole millions of dollars more than originally thought, federal prosecutors said Tuesday as they announced plans to try to seize her trucks, boats, horses and even unborn foals she owns.

A federal grand jury on Thursday returned an indictment charging Rita Crundwell with one count of wire fraud for allegedly siphoning more than $53million from the city of 16,000 since 1990 into a secret account she controlled.

Prosecutors originally alleged Crundwell, 58, had taken $30million.

Prosecutors contend she used the money
to pay for a lavish lifestyle as she worked as comptroller in Dixon, 
the boyhood home of the late President Ronald Reagan.

Prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit 
Thursday seeking 311 registered quarter horses and dozens of foals that 
are expected to be born this spring.

A news release announcing the suit 
said prosecutors plan to sell the horses and 'apply the proceeds toward 
restitution to the city of Dixon.'

Prosecutors said the horses are 
subject to forfeiture because Crundwell either bought or 'maintained 
them with criminal fraud proceeds.'

At the same time, the indictment seeks
criminal forfeiture of two residences, a horse farm in Dixon and a home
in Florida. It also seeks a $2.1million motorhome, more than a dozen 
trucks, trailers, motorized farm equipment, a pontoon boat, and cars, 
including a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette roadster.

The indictment also seeks the forfeiture of more than $224,000 in cash from two bank accounts.

Last month, FBI agents sought to remove the motor home a $146,787 2009 Kenworth T800 Tractor Truck, a $140,000 2009 Freightliner Truck and a $258,698 2009 Featherlite Horse Trailer.

The investigation also yielded evidence that Crundwell had paid off $2.5 million on her personal American Express card and spent $339,000 on jewellery alone reported the Chicago Tribune.

Despite being only entitled to four week of vacation annually, Crundwell took an additional 12 weeks in 2011.

So in October of last year while 
Crundwell was taking time off her $80,000 a year job, her stand-in 
noticed discrepancies on the city's bank statements.

These showed that in September of 
2011 three deposits totaling $785,000 had been made as well as 84 
cheques drawn to the tune of $360,493 and 40 cash withdrawls totalling 
$266,605.

Realising that this was irregular the 
employee alerted the town's mayor to the secret account that Crundwell 
had created to allegedly hide her fraud.

Federal prosecutors allege Crundwell 
created phony invoices that she characterized as being from the state of
Illinois. She then allegedly put that money from a city account into 
another account, which she repeatedly used for personal use.

According to the news release, she 
said she used the state's much-publicized dire financial straits to her 
advantage, telling city officials that the state was late in payments as
a way to conceal her transfers of funds and her spending.

If convicted, Crundwell faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.

The former comptroller will be arraigned May 7 in U.S. District Court in Rockford.

Crundwell's attorney was not in his 
office Tuesday and in a recorded message he said he would not be back in
the office until Wednesday. Crundwell could not be reached; the phone 
rang unanswered at a listing for her.
