A secret underground bunker built to protect essential services in the event of a nuclear war is to go under the hammer.

The bunker, which was constructed in Coswarth in Cornwall at the height of the Cold War, was built so experts at the then South West Water Authority would be able to maintain water and sewerage operations during a nuclear emergency.

The 3,000 square foot bunker, built in 1978 to house 16 people - seven in the operations room, six in the communications room and three in the control room, has a guide price of £50,000.

Discrete: The rooms themselves are all deep underground, with the only hint of life below the surface being a small brick entrance building

The bunker's features include several blast-proof doors, an air lock, a decontamination room, a dining room, a recreation room and two dormitories.

Brian Blake, South West Water's asset performance manager, worked for the Authority at the time and can recall visiting the bunker as it was being prepared for potential habitation.

'I remember that the Government said we had to provide an underground control centre in case of emergency which was bomb and nuclear proof,' he said.

'It wasn't fully kitted out as there was no furniture in there, but if something had happened you could have lived in there for weeks.'

Space: The 3,000 sq ft bunker, built in 1978 to house 16 people - seven in the operations room, six in the communications room and three in the control room, had a guide price of £50,000

The bunker and adjacent land eventually sold for £140,000, nearly three times the asking price

Chris Shapland, the Authority's property manager, added: 'We regularly auction redundant assets to reduce our costs and keep customers' bills as low as possible, but this is the first time we've offered a genuine piece of Cold War history.'

'Novelty sites with small areas of surplus land always attract strong interest as people are able to invest relatively modest sums for their 'little bit of England',' he added.

Mr Shapland said several of the Authority's former storage reservoirs and pumping stations have already been converted by their new owners into unusual homes.

Speaking of the new bunker's sale he added: 'It will be interesting to see what happens to the bunker - you never know who could end up using it.'

The bunker and some adjacent land will be sold at auction on March 25.
