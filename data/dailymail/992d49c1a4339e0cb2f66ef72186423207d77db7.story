The husband of brain-dead woman whose right-to-die battle in Florida sparked national outrage has slammed then-Governor Jeb Bush as 'vindictive', 'untrustworthy' and 'a coward'

Theresa Marie 'Terri' Schiavo lived in a vegetative state from 1990 to 2005 following a cardiac arrest as doctors kept her alive with feeding tubes.

Throughout the 15-year battle, her husband Michael Schiavo said, Jeb Bush fought with the courts to prevent her euthanasia.

'Untrustworthy': Michael Schiavo (left) has not forgiven Jeb Bush (right) for trying to stop his brain-dead wife Terri Schiavo from being given the right to die

Battle: Theresa Marie 'Terri' Schiavo lived in a vegetative state from 1990 to 2005 following a cardiac arrest as doctors kept her alive with feeding tubes

'It was a living hell and I blame him,' he told Politico. 

'I wouldn't trust him in any type of political office.'

Insisting that the 'thinking part' of his wife's brain no longer functioned, Michael Schiavo - and numerous physicians - called on the state, and the federal government, to let her die.

However, her Catholic parents, and their privately hired physicians, disputed the diagnoses and adamantly opposed euthanasia.

In April 2001, a court ordered for the tube to be removed - but it was inserted days later following an appeal. 

In February 2005, a Pinellas County judge ordered for the tube to be removed - prompting President George W Bush to sign legislation designed to prevent the order.

However, the court upheld its ruling. On March 18 the tube was finally removed. On March 31, 2005, Terri Schiavo died.

It has since emerged that Jeb Bush, then governor of Florida, wrote to prosecutor Bernie McCabe following Schiavo's death, to say: 'I urge you to take a fresh look at this case without any preconceptions as to the outcome.'

He called on McCabe to check how long it took Michael Schiavo to call 911 after his wife's initial fall. 

However, McCabe found no evidence of criminality. 

Ten years later, as Jeb Bush reveals plans to potentially succeed his father and brother in the Oval Office, Schiavo is livid.

He lambasts the younger Bush for siding with his wife's parents, pushing executive power to its limits, and never getting in touch following the debaucle.

He told Politico: 'I've had politicians come to my home and apologize to me for what they did to me... But I never heard from Jeb.' 

He says he relishes the prospect of meeting Bush if he decides to attempt a rapprochement during his 2016 campaign.

'Bring it on,' Schiavo said. 'Come visit me. I'm asking you. Almost 10 years later and I still haven't heard from you.

'Was he afraid to meet with me? To see me? Why? That's what burns me. You got so much to say—but where are you? You lost against this little ordinary man from Philadelphia. You lost. And then to continue on? Unspeakable.

'Why? Give me an answer. Why? Why? What was Terri Schiavo to you? Why? Tell me why. Why do you think you had the right to be involved? Why would you put me and my family through hell? And what did you gain from that? And after you lost, why did you pursue it? What did you gain from that? 

'He made life, for a lot of people—the nursing home people, the local police, lawyers—he made everybody miserable.' 

'It was appalling,' Jon Eisenberg, one of Michael Schiavo's attorneys and the author of The Right vs The Right To Die, told Politico.

'And I think it's important for people to understand what Jeb Bush is willing to do. It's important for people to know who Jeb Bush is, and the Terri Schiavo case tells us a great deal about who Jeb Bush is.'
