She was clearly a fan of silk undergarments, although with a 52-inch waist and a 66-inch bust to accommodate, expensive they certainly were.

Now a pair of Queen Victoria's silk bloomers are to go under the hammer - and are expected to fetch as much as £2,000 ($3,200).

Also set to be sold off is a silk chemise that was worn by the royal during the final years of her life and which is said to be in 'exquisite condition'.

For sale: Queen Victoria's 52 inch waist silk bloomers will go under the hammer on Sunday

Popular: Queen Victoria was one of Britain's longest-reigning monarchs and ruled from 1837 until 1901

The garments, which are equivalent to a modern size 26, were given to a member of royal staff following Queen Victoria's death and have been passed down through generations of the same family.

Due to go under the hammer on the 12th October at the Westernhanger auction house in Kent, auctioneers say that the items are some of the most unusual ever to pass through its doors.

'This is definitely one of the strangest items I have ever had the opportunity to sell in my 40-odd years in the business,' said auctioneer Michael Hogben. 'This really is a once in a blue moon sale'.

Intimate though the latest sale is, this is not the first time Queen Victoria's personal belongings have gone under the hammer.

In 2011, another pair of royal bloomers - this time dating from the 1860s and boasting a much smaller 35-inch waist - were auctioned off, fetching £9,375 for the anonymous seller.

Like the current set, the knee-length knickers were made from fine silk and bore a VR [Victoria Regina] monogram on one leg.

Other items of royal memorabilia to go under the hammer in recent years include a piece of her wedding cake and an unused pair of her black silk stockings. 

Queen Victoria ruled Britain and its Empire from the 20th June 1837 until her death on the 22nd January 1901 and is one of the longest reigning monarchs in British history.

Also for sale: The knickers - and a silk chemise with a 66 inch bust - are monogrammed with VR

Pretty: The bloomers, which are expected to fetch up to £2,000, also boast delicate lace detailing

Along with the Queen and the rest of the British royal family, Queen Victoria's descendants include the royal families of Belgium, Norway, Spain and Sweden, as well as the world's only other reigning queen, Queen Margrethe of Denmark.

Famously private, Victoria fell into a prolonged period of grief following her husband Prince Albert's death and was rarely seen in public after his demise.

Despite her reluctance to engage with her subjects, under Victoria's reign, the UK went from strength-to-strength, becoming one of the world's most powerful countries and ruler of the biggest empire ever to exist.
