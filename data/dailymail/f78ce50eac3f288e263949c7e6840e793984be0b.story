The family of a war veteran who died in action is outraged after photographs of him were used on a fake Facebook account and dating site profile.

Army Staff Sergeant Matthew Pucino, 34, of Massachusetts, died in 2009 while on combat patrol in Afghanistan while on his third tour of duty.

The Pucino family were alerted to the imposter when someone using Matthew Pucino's likeness and name tried to befriend an acquaintance on Facebook, claiming to live across the country in Dallas.

The family is still struggling to cope with their loss and the use of Matthew Pucino's identity left them disturbed and furious.

'I was about coming out of my skin. I don't even know how to describe it, I mean the anger it was hard to sleep that night I was so furious that someone would disrespect his name and pose as Matthew, he's a fallen hero," Pucino's sister Lisa Haglof told Fox News.

The imposter also used Pucino's pictures, taken from a memorial Facebook page set up in his honor, on an online dating site.

The family contacted Facebook 
Wednesday to remove the page, but the site informed them that it had to 
follow a 'process' before it could be taken down.

Hagelof told the Cape Cod Times that she's angry with Facebook's reaction

'They have measures. They have the ability to figure this out quickly,' she said of Facebook. 'They should show respect for him.

The page appears to have been removed sometime Thursday morning.

It's unclear what the imposters stand to gain from using the fake profiles, but Hagelof-Pucino is concerned that other deceased veterans' photographs may also have been used for fake profiles.

Pucino was a Green Beret who died when enemy forces attacked his unit with an improvised explosive.

A U.S. Post Office in Sagamore Beach and a Cape Cod bridge have been named in his honor.
