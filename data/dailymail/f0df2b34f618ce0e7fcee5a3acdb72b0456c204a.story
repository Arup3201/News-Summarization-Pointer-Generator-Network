Florida authorities say a twin-engine propeller plane crashed in a rural part of Miami-Dade County shortly after takeoff on Wednesday, killing all four people aboard.

Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen identified the plane as a Beechcraft 1900 that had been headed to Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands.

She said the plane was attempting to return to Miami Executive Airport when it crashed about 2:45 p.m after reporting engine trouble.

Trip: An FAA spokeswoman has identified the plane as a Beechcraft 1900 that had been headed to Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands

Return: FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said the plane was attempting to return to Miami Executive Airport when it crashed about 2:45 p.m.

All four people on board the aircraft died in the crash, said Miami-Dade Fire Rescue spokesman Lt. Arnold Piedrahita.

He said the pilot reported engine problems after takeoff, then clipped a power line before the plane hit the ground and burst into flames.

No buildings on the ground were damaged in an area dominated by farmland, although one large structure was not far away.

'We have found no signs of survivors,' Piedrahita said. 'We know the plane experienced some form of engine trouble.'

Piedrahita told WSVN 'Thankfully he was able to touch down in an area where there wasn't more people on the ground, in an open field. Unfortunately, the passengers weren't able to survive this.' 

The identities of the people killed were not immediately released.

However, family friend Adriana Chirinos told Local 10 that Venezuelan Raul Chirivella piloted the plane, and that the other men included Roberto Cavaniel, Juan Carlos Betancourt, and a fourth man.

'He's a really good guy,' Chirinos told the television station. 'We have known him more than 30 years.'

Witness Hector Garcia told WSVN 'I was heading south on Krome Avenue, and I saw the plane getting pretty, pretty close to the ground.

'The pilot looked like he was trying to save the plane, to smooth out the landing, but when it crossed Krome Avenue heading west, the tail, once it caught ground, it just slammed the front end of the plane, and it instantly caught fire.'

Another witness, Angelica Rivera, told the television station 'For a second I thought it was coming down to land but then I knew that the [Miami Executive Airport] was kind of a distance from it, so that's when we all started to notice that it was just coming downwards like faster in a plummet than it should have been.'

Bergen said the plane is not registered in the U.S.

She said the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the cause of the crash.
