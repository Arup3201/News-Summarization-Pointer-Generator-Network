Brazil star Neymar clearly isn't superstitious when it comes to his hair.

After scoring twice in victory to open the World Cup, Neymar showed up with a new style at the squad's training session Sunday. So did left back Dani Alves, his Barcelona teammate.

Neymar's head was shaved on the sides, with the front dyed blond. Alves' shorter cut had a silver tinge to it.

Neymar has been known to constantly change his hairstyle during tournaments. Alves also shows up with different haircuts from time to time. 

Their new look is similar to the makeover Romania's players had during France 98 when they all dyed their hair blond.

Brazil will play its second World Cup match against Mexico on Tuesday in the northeastern city of Fortaleza.
