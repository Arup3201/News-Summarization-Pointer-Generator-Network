Accused: Ian Walters has been charged with the murder of his wife Tracy after a car crash on the M1

A former church treasurer has been 
charged with murdering his horse rider wife by swerving off a motorway 
and smashing their car into a tree.

Tracy Maria Walters, 48, died in hospital two days after the collision on the M1 near Markfield, Leicester.

Her
 husband, Ian John Walters, 50, was behind the wheel of the black 
Mitsubishi L200 Animal when they careered off the south carriageway into
 a tree on March 21.

Mr Walters was also flown to Coventry's University Hospital with serious injuries but survived.

Today
 police confirmed Walters, a former Parochial Church Council treasurer 
at Christ Church in Swindon, Wiltshire, has this week been charged with 
Mrs Walters' murder.

A 
spokesman for Leicester Police said he appeared at Leicester Crown Court
 on Monday and was remanded in custody to appear again on June 23.

Mrs
 Walters, from Swindon, was a keen endurance horse rider - an equestrian
 sport in which participants take part in competitive long distance 
races.

Following her death, a
 tribute was posted on the Endurance GB (EGB) website - the national 
body for endurance riding in England and Wales.

The tribute, which was released after Mrs Walters’ funeral in Swindon on May 30, read: 'Tracy was well known in the group and very good at supporting new members as well as producing the group newsletter. She will be sadly missed by us all.

'After the service the family released helium filled balloons shaped as horses - it was very moving as five horses disappeared into the sky up towards the Ridgeway where Tracy loved to ride.

'There was also a beautiful floral tribute in the shape of an Appalosa horse - many of you will know that Tracy had a beautiful three-year-old old Appalosa, Missy, who she was hoping to start this year.

'Tracy’s family have requested that donations in memory of Tracy could be made to Fairfield Farm College which is an Independent Specialist College for students with learning disabilities. Horse Studies is one of their curriculum areas.

'When Tracy’s horse Tristan retired from competitive rides Tracy kindly loaned him to the college. Tristan was used to teach horse care and riding and also went to local shows with students.'

Karen Collier, EGB chairwoman, added: 'Such terribly sad news. Tracy has been such a supporter of EGB, both as a rider and as a technical steward.

'Tracy had ambitions to further her competitive career with us and how sad it is that these dreams were not to be realised.

'Her contributions to EGB have been much valued. Our thoughts must go to her husband and sons at this most difficult of times.'

A family notice posted ahead of Mrs Walters’ funeral described her as a 'loving wife, mother and grandmother.'
