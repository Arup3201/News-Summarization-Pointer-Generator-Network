A takeaway owner has been fined £7,500 after he served up a chicken kebab special with a three-inch drill bit on top. 

Nehmatullah Jamalzadah was ordered to pay after a customer bit into the metal after he ordered the takeaway from Pizza Top/Top Kebab in Hornchurch in Essex.

The customer alerted environmental health who searched the takeaway and found electrical equipment, screwdrivers, decorating materials and other kit had not been cleared away following repair work, strewn across the restaurant.

Screws and other drill bits were found in a drawer near to clean containers used for food orders, Romford Magistrates' Court heard.  

Jamalzadah, of Hornchurch, was fined £6,000 and told to pay £1,556 costs for breaking section 14 of the food safety act 1990 - selling food not of the nature, substance or quality demanded.

He was also told to pay a £120 victim surcharge and £50 compensation to the customer by Romford magistrates.

The customer had made the order through the Just Eat website, which linked him to the Pizza Top/Top Kebab website.

Coun Osman Dervish, Havering Council's cabinet member for regulatory services, said after the case: 'While on this occasion the customer did not come to any harm, this is a very serious breach of the law, which we will not tolerate.

'We take food safety seriously and will take action when necessary.

'The owner of this takeaway had a responsibility to keep customers safe while the building work was carried out and this was clearly ignored.'
