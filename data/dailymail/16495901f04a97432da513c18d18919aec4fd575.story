Google is paying a record $22.5million fine to settle allegations that it broke a privacy promise by secretly tracking millions of Web surfers who use Apple's Safari browser.

The penalty announced Thursday by the Federal Trade Commission is the largest fine imposed against a company for violating a previous agreement with the agency.

In spite of their hefty payout, Google isn't admitting any wrongdoing in the latest settlement.

Shady dealings: The fine comes as the FTC argues Google used it's cookie software to track user's information without their knowledge

They claim that the fine does not directly pertain to Google's data collection, but for misrepresenting what was happening.

Last October, Google had signed a 20-year agreement that, among other things, included a company pledge not to mislead consumers about its privacy practices.

The FTC opened its investigation into the Safari activities six months ago after a researcher at Stanford University revealed that Google had overridden Safari safeguards that are supposed to prevent outside parties from monitoring Web surfing activity without a user's permission.

The tracking occurs through snippets of computer coding, known as cookies, that help Internet services and advertisers target marketing pitches based on an analysis of the interests implied by a person's Web surfing activity.

Paying up: Google CEO Larry Page and his fellow officials deny any wrongdoing in the case but are paying the fine because they misrepresented previous findings

Google immediately withdrew its intrusive technology from Safari after the manipulation was reported.

But the circumvention of Apple's built-in settings appeared to contradict a statement in Google's online help center assuring Safari users that they didn't need to do anything more to ensure their online activities wouldn't be logged by Google.

The apparent contradiction between Google's words and actions became the focal point of the FTC investigation.

Google's fine surpasses a nearly $19million penalty that the FTC slapped on a telemarketer accused of duping people into believing they were donating to charities.

Google's stock price increased 60 cents to $642.83 in midday trading Thursday, after the FTC announcement.
