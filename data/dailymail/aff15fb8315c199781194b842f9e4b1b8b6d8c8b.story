Cycling-mad Imran Mughal arrived home to rapturous applause after spending 15 months pedalling 25,000 miles around the world when he was made redundant.

The former NHS worker has revealed his album of fascinating photographs from his trip which took  him to 33 countries in four continents in just over a year.

After surviving a terrifying ordeal at gunpoint in Bosnia, deadly spiders in the Australian outback, 53-degree heat in the Oman desert and cycling through monsoons in Indonesia, Imran is now glad to be back with his family.

The 35-year-old, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: 'I can't believe what I have seen and done. I have lived a lifetime in 15 months.

'I think I am the first English Pakistani man to do something like this. In my community it is a huge positive thing.

'I am really proud of myself for doing this, I can't believe I have lived out a dream. And the most amazing thing I will take away from this is that the world is generally good and to be in an unfortunate situation is a rare thing.'

Imran, 35, left his hometown, Harehills, in May last year and visited 33 countries including China

'On my journey around the world I experienced the most overwhelming hospitality, love and support.

'I've been asked if I was ever scared while I was on my own in remote places but it's much scarier on a night out in Leeds.

'When you are in such wonderful places, with stars overhead in the middle of nowhere with only the sounds of nature enveloping you, it is wonderful, so serene. It is blissful.'

Imran first started cycling at 18 years old when he bought a second-hand bike that he used as his mode of transport.

He said: 'It wasn't until the bike was nicked three months later that I realised how much I loved cycling and how much I missed it. Five days later I had got myself a better bike and I was off.'

Imran decided to take on the challenge after being made redundant from his NHS job, using his redundancy money to fund his trip and has raise thousands of pounds for the charity, Charity: Water.

He arrived back in Leeds from his once-in-a-lifetime trip on August 2 and was welcomed home by 70 friends and family, who lined the street and applauded as he cycled down Banstead Terrace to his front door.

Far flung: Imran, pictured in Thailand, now home, plans to continue fundraising by writing a book about his trip

Imran now plans to continue fundraising by writing a book about his trip and hopes to visit schools to speak about his experiences, inspire others and promote cycling and healthy living.

He is also hoping to get more Asian children  involved in the sport. He told how on sporting events he was almost always the only Asian involved. 

Although the real message, he said, is: 'You can do anything you put your mind to, whatever your challenge, wherever you come from.'

Imran set off from London on May 4, 2013. He cycled an average of 100 miles each day, with his longest distance being 157 miles in one day.

Adventurous: His travels by bicylce took Imran as far as Indonesia

He travelled from London to France, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Dubai, Oman, India, China, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Canada, Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium and back to England.

He said: 'I didn't cycle through Pakistan because my mum made me promise that I didn't go there.

'Going to Pakistan is okay but it is the bordering countries that are pretty lawless.

'I did look into it but I considered that it wasn't worth risking my life for, or breaking a mother's promise.

'In the end it worked out for the best because it meant instead the route took me through Dubai, where I lived with workers and saw behind the glitz and glamour, and Oman, where I travelled in 53 degree heat but managed to fill up with icy cold water every 40-or-so miles whenever I came across a mosque - these were fantastic places to travel through.'

Viva la France: Imran's 15-month adventure took him across Europe

The most terrifying moment was when he was in Bosnia and was looking for somewhere to set up camp. He found an old derelict house and started to unpack when a man arrived with a gun to shoo him off.

He ended up outside the house on his knees with his hands behind his head and a gun to his head.

When the man realised he was harmless he let him go, but not before Imran said his prayers thinking he was going to die.

In Iran he was robbed of $900 when two men pulled up in a car pretending to be cops and searched his bags.

He said: 'But the upshot was that the robbery meant I ended up staying in a village I wasn't originally going to stay in and ended up seeing such hospitality I couldn't believe it.

'My faith in humanity was destroyed and restored all in one day.'

He said of his trip: "It was the most amazing time of my life, but all good things must come to an end.

'Now the wheels have stopped rolling I can really focus on the fundraising side of it and look forward to my future knowing anything is possible.'
