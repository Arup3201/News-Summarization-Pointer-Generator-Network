A 50 per cent rebate is available for family day care providers who look after children in the childcare worker's home

Families may be allowed access to a government rebate to employ qualified childcare workers in their home, amid Family Day Care Australia's push to boost parental choice in a submission to the Productivity Commission.

A 50 per cent rebate is available for family day care providers who look after children in the childcare worker's home, but the same worker employed in the family home is considered a 'nanny' and therefore not eligible.

Now Prime Minister Tony Abbott is reportedly considering extending that rebate to qualified carers in the family home to increase choice for parents and raise workforce participation. 

This would allow parents in the workforce to void the hassle of drop off and pick up and keeping children from being disrupted.  

'We are absolutely committed to getting productivity and participation up,' Mr Abbott told the Sunday Telegraph.

'Better childcare, along with better paid parental leave, is a part of that.'

Prime Minister Abbott said the decision will see a boost to Gross Domestic Product with an increase of female participation in the workforce.

The Productivity Commission is assessing the options for child care in Australia, with an interim report recommending the rebate be extended to nannies.

Mr Abbott says the option will  considered in the lead up to the 2015 budget.
