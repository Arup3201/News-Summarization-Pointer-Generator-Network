Former NFL star Larry Johnson has been arrested by police after allegedly attacking a man with a broken bottle at a hotel nightclub in the early hours of the morning. 

The 34-year-old, once one of the league's highest paid players, is accused of assaulting Drew Johnson after he took drinks from his table at the luxury Delano Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida.

He reportedly punched the 29-year-old in the face, before breaking a bottle on the table and 'swinging it toward him', leaving him bleeding from his neck and arms.

He then punched the victim 'a few more times' as he lay on the ground, it is alleged. Security guards eventually separated the men and Miami Beach Fire Rescue were called to the scene.

The victim, a promoter who frequents the club in South Beach, was taken to a nearby hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, according to a police report obtained by TMZ.

Johnson, a former running back, was charged with aggravated battery following the alleged attack at around 3am. He was booked at 7.33am and is being held on $7,500 bail.

Miami-Dade County jail records did not list an attorney for him, NBC Miami reported.

Johnson played in the NFL from 2003 to 2011 after starring at Penn State. His best years were with the Kansas City Chiefs, when he rushed for more than 1,700 yards in both 2005 and 2006.

He ended his career with the Miami Dolphins, for whom he played just one game, and also played for the Washington Redskins and Cincinnati Bengals.

It is not the first time the former player has had a run-in with the law.

In 2012, Johnson was arrested at a Las Vegas resort after an ex-girlfriend told police he choked her into unconsciousness and left her in her underwear in a hotel hallway. 

Success: Johnson played in the NFL from 2003 to 2011 after starring at Penn State. His best years were with the Kansas City Chiefs (pictured; Johnson is no 27), when he rushed for over 1,700 yards in  2005 and 2006

He was later sentenced to one year's probation, a $345 fine and 48 hours of community service after pleading no contest to misdemeanor domestic violence battery and assault.

A felony charge was dropped as part of the plea deal, it was reported at the time. 

In 2008, Johnson was accused of spitting and threatening to kill a woman in a Kansas City nightclub.
