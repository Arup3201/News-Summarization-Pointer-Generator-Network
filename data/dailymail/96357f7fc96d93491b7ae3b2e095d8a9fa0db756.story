A one-legged Romanian millionaire who set a world record for marrying and divorcing the same woman six times is now single again.

Silviu Prigoana, 50, has a tumultuous relationship with Adriana Bahmuteanu, 39, and she has now left him for a seventh time.

But he does not appear to be too upset by the most recent split from the mother of his children and boasted on Monday:  'When it comes to sex, the woman who could refuse me has not yet been born.

'However, women always find reasons to neglect me, but that wasn't the case with Adriana.

'If she wants, she can leave, she can do whatever she wants.

'She called me a filthy b******, but she came back so many times I figure I can't be that much of a filthy b******. I won't kick her out of the house, but if she wants to leave, what can I do?'

The former politician, who lost his leg to childhood polio, said his wife used to receive 'royal treatment' when at his side.

He said he gave her gifts worth tens of thousands of euros.

'I don't know why she was unhappy. I got her over 50 purses and none cost less than 1,000 euros (£800),' he said.

'I got her 7,000 euro (£5,600) watches, even some 15,000 euro (£12,000) ones. I do not know where they are, they're not in my house.

'Many women would have loved to be in Adriana's spot', he said.

Mr Prigoana is a Romanian businessman who owns Rosal Group, a waste collection company.

He is also the founder of several TV stations, one of which only broadcasts gypsy music videos (Taraf TV, like a gypsy MTV) and is worth 30 million EUR, according to Forbes Romania.

In 2010, he attempted to pass a bill that was supposed to force so-called gypsy witches to pay tax for their services of predicting the future for people - it did not pass.
