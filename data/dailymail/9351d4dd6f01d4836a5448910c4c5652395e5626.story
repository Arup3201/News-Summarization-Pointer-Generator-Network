A controversial mosque planned for the Gold Coast has been rejected due to a fiery backlash from the city's residents.

Police and extra security were posted outside the city's council chambers on Wednesday as councillors deliberated on a motion to reject the Islamic mosque - which had been the subject of a social media hate campaign directed at councillor Chris Robbins.

After a morning of high-drama outside the chambers, the council voted to reject the Currumbin-based hall of worship  10 votes to five.

The plans for the 4768 square metre site triggered several protests from residents with some waving anti-Islamic signs throughout the approvals process.

A week earlier the plan triggered a hate-filled Facebook page directed at councillor Chris Robbins, which she alleged was riddled with death and rape threats levelled against her.

Prior to Tuesday's decision the council received a record 3867 submissions and eight petitions containing 5511 signatures against the proposal.

Ms Robbins claimed she was subjected to 'horrific vilification' on Facebook when damming comments were posted about her in relation to the mosque, which she voted against on Wednesday. 

The councillor had an image of her pictured on the anti-Islamic page which she requested Facebook take down.

Ms Robbins said the page was defamatory and called for all comments directed toward her to also be removed.

'Horrific vilification, threatening all kinds of nastiness directed at me because I'd basically gone to the meeting and said council's got an application for a mosque and we will be assessing it as we're obliged to by law,' she said.

'That essentially peeved some people who wanted me to stand up and say that at the end of the day this wouldn't happen.' 

She said the lack of accountability for the Facebook page's authors is despicable and highlights how easily people can target victims through social media with little fear of consequences. 

Ms Robbins led the calls against the mosque on Tuesday saying the council had let down the community by not fully assessing the impact it would have on them.

About 30 opponents cheered and booed from the public gallery with about 10 officers on standby in case violence erupted. 

Councillors from both sides of the debate expressed concern that the decision to refuse the application would result in a court appeal which could be costly for ratepayers.
