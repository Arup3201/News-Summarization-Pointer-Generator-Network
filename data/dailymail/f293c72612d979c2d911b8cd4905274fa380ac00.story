QPR defender Rio Ferdinand took the opportunity to mimic the pose Bayern Munich duo Dante and Jerome struck in their team photo during his side's one on Wednesday.

The 35-year-old has already declared he is fit and raring to go for this season as he looks to help keep Harry Redknapp's men in the Premier League.

And the former Manchester United defender appeared to want to show evidence of that during the photo shoot, showing off his physique at the club's Harlington training base, as he pulled his shirt back in an attempt to look buff for the cameras.

Despite falling to consecutive 4-0 away league defeats the mood around the QPR camp doesn't seem to have been affected, with plenty of banter on show throughout.

Chilean duo Mauricio Isla and Eduardo Vargas are used to the hot continental weather and clearly found it a bit too chilly at Harlington on Wednesday as they pulled they arms out of their sleeves.

Out-of-favour midfielder Shaun Wright-Phillips also looked in bouyant mood while Glenn Hoddle and Joey Barton were seeing joking around.
