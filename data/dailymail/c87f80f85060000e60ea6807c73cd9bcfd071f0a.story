A cup of coffee is the perfect pick-me-up for many people around the world.

But it’s not just human beings that require a caffeine fix anymore.

Apparently our canine friends are also partial to the odd skinny latte from time-to-time.

Or at least one dog named Apollo, whose hilarious reaction was filmed by his owners in Saint Catharines, Canada.

Filmed in the lounge, German Shepherd is initially featured counting sheep while enjoying a lazy Saturday morning on the sofa.

Appearing to address the camera, its owner is only able to utter the word ‘coffee’ before the dog’s ears stand on end and its head turns towards her attentively.

Listening as the woman continues to speak, the dog seems to wait for her to finish her sentence.

But as she uses the word coffee again, it springs from its seat and makes its way around the table and towards her.

Whining in excitement, the animated dog begins pacing in anticipation while its fellow pets in the house look on bemusedly.

Explaining the dog’s behaviour, the owners told Newsflare that the German Shepherd, which is now three-years-old, has visited Tim Hortons coffee shop with them every Saturday since it was a year old.

She explained: ‘So every Saturday morning since he was a year old we have gone to Tim Hortons for our morning coffee, he has always come for the ride! If we don't go to Tim Hortons within the first hour or two upon waking up, he starts to wine and nudge us.

'This morn we were up an hour and I then started to video him before I said the words.. We can't say coffee in our house!'
