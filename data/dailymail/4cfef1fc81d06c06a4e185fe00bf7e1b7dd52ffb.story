The completed stone tomb of Richard III is to go on public display after being lowered into position overnight - 530 years after his death in battle.

A special service marking the end of the king's journey from his forgotten grave under a council car park to a place of honour in Leicester Cathedral is being held today.

The 2.3-ton tombstone, with its Christian cross carved on the top, was lifted carefully into place overnight, sealing the king beneath.

The setting of the great slab of Yorkshire Swaledale stone marks the end of a week in which the king was reinterred in a ceremony that included a poetry reading by actor Benedict Cumberbatch.

The Queen called yesterday's service a moment of 'great national significance'.

Organisers aimed to rebury the king with the 'dignity and honour' he was denied in death, after his original burial in a hastily-dug grave in the old Greyfriars church following his death at Bosworth field.

The cathedral said it was expecting 'a considerable number of visitors from all over the world' to come and see the king's completed memorial.

Today's 'service or reveal' will include interpretative dance charting the rediscovery of Richard's grave, the science behind identifying his remains and his reburial.

A banner with the king's coat of arms, provided by the Richard III Society, will also be hung over the tomb in the ambulatory during the service.

Liz Hudson, the cathedral's communications director, said: 'King Richard III's tomb is now a permanent feature in Leicester Cathedral.

Archaeologists discovered the king under a council car park not far from the cathedral in August 2012

'However, there are still a considerable number of visitors from all over the world in Leicester who we expect will want to take a last opportunity to see it before returning home.

'We anticipate a great deal of interest and suggest that people who live locally may find it easier to plan a visit to see the tomb at a slightly later date.'

Last Sunday, more than 35,000 lined the streets for a procession of the king's coffin from the University of Leicester, whose archaeologists discovered his grave, to Bosworth and finally on to Leicester.

Throughout the week, thousands waited in line for hours to see Richard's coffin as it lay in repose in the cathedral, before yesterday's reinterment presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.

Actor Benedict Cumberbatch, Downton Abbey creator and writer Julian Fellowes and historical novelist Philippa Gregory attended the service, alongside the Countess of Wessex and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.

Archaeologists discovered the king under a council car park not far from the cathedral in August 2012, after a campaign to find him led by Philippa Langley.

An extensive series of scientific tests established that the skeleton, found in a grave too short for his body, was that of the last Yorkist king.

His final rest was delayed by months after distant relatives brought an unsuccessful legal challenge through the courts, arguing he should be reburied in York.
