He's had more hair styles than Imelda Marcos has shoes.

And the men of Britain, it seems, have loved them all.

Football star David Beckham has the hairstyle that most men are dying to emulate, a new study has revealed.

David Beckham has the hairstyle that most British men want - one in ten to be precise

As many as one in ten men attempt 
to keep up with the former England captain's crop, whether it's shaved, pony-tailed, plaited, corn-rowed or mo-hawked.

The father-of-four, 37, beat Take That frontman Gary Barlow - who came second - and Twilight star Robert Pattinson - who nabbed third place - to the top spot of a survey carried out by hair brand Fudge.

The study also revealed that cycling Olympic champion Bradley 
Wiggins has inspired men to grow sideburns with 3.6 per cent of the 
population copying the Sports Personality of the Year.

Heartthrob Harry Styles missed out on a 
place in the top five. The One Direction star finished sixth with only 
2.5 per cent of the vote compared with Beckham's 10 per cent, Barlow's eight per cent and Pattinson's four per cent.

While scissor happy Becks has come up top he's still very much unlike the usual British man, who will only change his hairstyle 'four times in his lifetime'

The results also revealed that - unlike Beckham - the average British man will only change his hairstyle four times in his lifetime.

Regionally, while only half of men admit they check their hair in a mirror during a night out, Essex men are the most likely to examine their locks every single time they pass a mirror.

More than a third of men from Newcastle, Sheffield and Manchester visit salons at least once a month - while only one in ten Bristol and Brighton-based chaps go for even a monthly trim.

The average British male spends 24 minutes perfecting their hair before a big night out, with Glaswegians topping the list at half an hour.

David Beckham....................................................................................11%

Gary Barlow............................................................................................8%

Robert Pattinson................................................................................4.1%

Bradley Wiggins...................................................................................3.6%

Brad Pitt................................................................................................3%

Harry Styles.........................................................................................2.5%

Will.i.am..............................................................................................2.2%

Snoop Dogg.......................................................................................1.75%

Bradley Cooper.................................................................................1.25%

Russell Brand.......................................................................................1.2%

Many men are happy to get guidance from their partners as one in ten admitted their other half picked their current hairstyle.

And a quarter of of the 2,000 males questioned revealed they secretly use their partner's hair styling products.

More than one in three Essex men check it every time they see a mirror

British men are curious about creating new styles as 10 per cent admitted to using their partner's hair dryer or straighteners to perfect their look.

Half of British men revealed that having good hair makes them feel more confident, while a further third said it makes them feel more attractive.

The biggest ageing concern for men is going bald, as one third are worried about losing their hair, rather than getting a beer belly and getting wrinkles.

John Vial, Creative Director for Fudge, said: 'From Kevin Keegan's perm to George Best's sideburns, footballers have always been powerful when it comes to influencing the hair styles of the nation's men.

'It's no surprise that David Beckham is the modern man's hairstyle icon, his versatile styles are ultimately achievable by the man on the street.

'I'm not surprised that Bradley's mod cut has out-styled the likes of Harry Styles and Brad Pitt.

'The man of the moment's influence on the hair of the nation confirms that when a sportsman endorses something, it automatically makes it more masculine and ultimately, desirable.'
