Detectives investigating the murder of a university graduate 17 years ago have arrested a man.

Melanie Hall was 25 when she disappeared in 1996 following a reported row with her boyfriend.

It was not until 2009 that her remains were found, in a bin-liner tied with blue rope at the side of a motorway.

Victim: A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of Melanie Hall, pictured, who vanished in 1996. He was later released on police bail

The suspect is 44 and from Bath, where
Miss Hall was last seen alive. He was arrested at his home last Tuesday
on suspicion of murder, questioned for two days and released on police 
bail.

Detectives also searched a house believed to be a former home of the man in the Twerton area of Bath.

The latest arrest is the fourth suspect to be questioned about Miss Hall’s murder since her remains were found.

Her father Steve, who lives near Bradford-upon-Avon, Wiltshire, yesterday described the development as ‘progress’.

He
said: ‘We are hopeful that progress is being made. It is a long and 
painful process 17 years down the line.

'This would appear to be 
connected to the appeal we made at the beginning of October, which is 
great. We are keeping our minds open on these things.

Appeal: Melanie's parents Steve and Pat Hall appear at a press conference in Bath four years ago after her remains were found by the M5

‘The
police are keeping us informed and we are hopeful. It is not the first 
time someone has been arrested in connection with her death but we are 
remaining positive.’

Miss 
Hall, who worked in a hospital, was last seen in June 1996 after 
apparently arguing with her doctor boyfriend in a nightclub. Despite a 
huge police operation, no trace of her was found.

In
2009, a workman found parts of her skeleton hidden in plastic bags as 
he cleared undergrowth just a few yards off the northbound slip road at 
junction 14 of the M5 near Thornbury, Gloucestershire.

It was nearly 30 miles from where the psychology graduate was last seen, sitting on a stool in a Cadillac’s nightclub.

A
total of five bin-liners contained or covered her remains, including 
arm and leg bones and her pelvis and skull.

Other parts of her skeleton 
were found partially buried nearby.

Tragic: The remains of university graduate Miss Hall were discovered dumped alongside the M5 motorway near Bristol in 2009

In
2009, a man was arrested after confessing to her murder, but later 
released following psychiatric tests.

Two men aged 38 and 39 were 
arrested on suspicion of her murder, but released in 2010.

The
latest arrest follows a breakthrough last month  when a distinctive 
white Volkswagen Golf GTi Cabriolet was recovered by police for forensic
tests.

The white, A-registration, soft-topped vehicle is known to have 
been driven in the Bath area in 1996 when Melanie was murdered.

The
Golf, which is almost 30 years old, was tracked down in 
Gloucestershire, although its current owner has no link to the 
investigation.

Officers made a second breakthrough relating to the origin of the blue rope used to bind Melanie’s body.

Although mass-produced and commonly used, police confirm they have ‘a credible account’ of where it came from.

Speaking
at the time, Detective Superintendent Mike Courtiour said: ‘This new 
information encourages me that we may be very close to catching the 
killer or killers of Melanie.

‘This has been a difficult case and it has never been closed.’

He
added: ‘Over the past four years we have received information, 
intelligence and names that we have taken seriously, researched and 
thoroughly investigated.

‘We have recently received information concerning the origin of the blue rope that was used to tie up Melanie’s body.

‘It is significant information and we are actively working on that line of inquiry.

‘We
are working with forensic scientists in relation to the rope and the 
circumstances of where that particular length of rope came from.

‘Also, we have recently found and recovered a car that may be relevant to events in 1996 when Melanie disappeared.

‘This is currently being examined by forensic scientists.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
