A former wrestling coach accused of molesting young boys in a YouTube video was hunted down and arrested by authorities in Mexico, police said Wednesday night.

Police arrested Herbert Ortiz, 29, of California, after a month-long search that was initiated by a YouTube video that a teenage boy posted online in which he accused Ortiz of molesting him.

The teen posted the video as a cautionary note to other kids and parents who might know Ortiz, a former assistant wrestling coach at Rosemead High School in California.

The Los Angeles Sheriff's department was alerted to the video by a woman from the community whose son had been coached by Ortiz.

She stumbled on the video and recognized the former coach's name, then asked her 14-year-old son whether he had ever been abused by Ortiz. Her son's answer was yes.

Authorities removed the video from YouTube as they began an investigation into the claims. Their investigation turned up more allegations of sexual abuse dating back to 2002.

At the time of their investigation, Ortiz was working as a coach at the Bad News Panthers Children's Wrestling Club in Rosemead, California. He was suspended from his job when Rosemead City officials learned of the allegations, even though he denied the claims.

Then Ortiz disappeared, and detectives determined that he was trying to elude authorities.

But he turned up one month later in Mexico after he visited the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara to get a travel visa for Guatemala, according to authorities.

Ortiz was turned over to detectives on Tuesday at Los Angeles International Airport. He was being held on $215,000 bail.
