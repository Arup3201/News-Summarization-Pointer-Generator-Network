Gordon Ramsay says he looks ‘like a piece of asparagus’ after losing more than two stone on a strict year-long diet and gruelling exercise regime.

The TV chef has cut out the fatty foods he once tucked into on his shows in favour of vegan shakes, almond milk and plates of vegetables.

From a starting weight of 16st 2lb, Ramsay – who is 6ft 2in – has dropped to a chiselled 14st with a face and figure that are almost unrecognisable to how he looked before deciding to get in shape for a triathlon.

Ramsay, 46, allows himself only one cup of coffee every two days – and the milk he takes with it is the only dairy product he uses.

He eats oatmeal or muesli in the mornings and favours protein-rich dishes such as poached fish and chicken.

The Hell’s Kitchen star has also been working out three to four days a week under separate coaches in the UK and Los Angeles.

His regime includes 70-mile cycle rides and 25-mile runs, and he has been getting up daily at 4.30am for two-hour swims while shooting his new series in LA.

Ramsay says he will not let his weight drop below 13st 8lb because he is already a 'piece of asparagus'

But he insists he will not let his weight go lower than 13st 8lb, telling November’s Triathlete magazine: ‘I look like a bloody piece of asparagus.’

Ramsay launched his health kick a year ago to prepare for the world’s toughest triathlon in Kona, Hawaii, and tried to keep his training secret by racing under an assumed name.

He finished the triathlon, which involved a 2.4-mile ocean swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a marathon, which is 26.2 miles long, in 14 hours, four minutes and 48 seconds a week ago.
