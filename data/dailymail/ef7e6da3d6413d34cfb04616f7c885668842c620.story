It's incredible what can be done with makeup.

As this artist reveals, it can not only transform your look from day to night, but from reality to dark fantasy.

Joyce Spakman, from Hilversum, Holland, has taken these incredible photographs which showcase her amazing makeovers - depicting versions of characters such as Pennywise the clown and Alice In Wonderland.

Joyce works for hours creating the look, which she captures in high-quality images

The 23-year-old, who has been practising make-up artistry for nine years, since she was 14, spends hours on the makeovers, capturing the results in high-quality images. 

'I began experimenting with make-up, starting with small paints on my arms and of course doodling on my arms at school, probably something everybody did,' she writes on boredpanda.com. 

'When I was 16, I decided to go to the all round make-up artist school in Amsterdam (ROC allround grimeur). 

'Had the best time of my life there! Through the education I also gained a passion for styling. 

'Now I make headdresses, no-sew clothing, photography backgrounds, etc I put a lot of time in my artworks and when I'm honest, it gives me a lot of stress.

'Normally, themed photoshoots have their hairstylists, photographers, make-up artists, etc, but I do everything by myself and without any professional photography equipment.  

'At the end of the day, when I have the final result, it always gives me an extremely satisfying feeling that I did everything on my own.'

On her Instagram Joyce says she loves to experiment with makeup.

'It can't be too extreme for me. I like the odd.'
