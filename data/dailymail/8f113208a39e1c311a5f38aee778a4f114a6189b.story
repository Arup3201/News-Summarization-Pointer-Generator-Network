Jailed: Neal Ray Schmidt thought he was meeting two 14-year-old girls for sex

A former senior member of the Ku Klux Klan has been jailed for attempting to arrange a sexual encounter with two undercover police officers who he believed were underage girls.

Neal Ray Schmidt, a former grand dragon of the Missouri chapter of the Klan, first met the police officers in an online chat room.

The 59-year-old believed he was talking to two 14-year-old girls who claimed they were friends and lived near each other in McDonough, Georgia.

Following a few general exchanges the former delivery man began to steer the conversation towards sex.

According to the Examiner.com, Patrick Crosby, the U.S. Attorney’s spokesman, said: 'Over the ensuing months, in an effort to groom the girls for an eventual sexual encounter, Schmidt sent sexually explicit videos of himself, as well as images and videos of child pornography.'

In June last year Schmidt made arrangements to meet the girls for sex at a McDonough motel.

However he was arrested by police officers in the car park carrying guns, sex toys and Klan paraphernalia. He later pleaded guilty in court for seeking to have sex with two 14-year-old girls.

On Thursday a judge in Atlanta sentenced Schmidt, from St.Louis, to 20 years in prison. After serving his sentence he will have to register as a sex offender.

U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said: 'This case starkly illustrates how the Internet can expose our children not only to the predator down the street, but also to the would-be molester who lives hundreds of miles away.'

Prosecutors also revealed that since his arrest in this case Schmidt has been charged with molesting his granddaughter in Missouri and with arranging to have sex with an underage girl in Florida.
