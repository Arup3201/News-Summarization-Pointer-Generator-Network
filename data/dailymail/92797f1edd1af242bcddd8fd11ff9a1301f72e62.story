Germany launched its first ever aerial blitz on Britain exactly 100 years ago tonight when two Zeppelins were sent on a bombing mission which killed four.

On the nights of January 19 and 20, 1915, two of the airships were heading for Humberside but were blown further down the east coast by strong gusts.

Heralding a new era of warfare, their first two targets - King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth, in Norfolk - were chosen purely by the direction of the wind.

The Germans launched their first ever blitz on Britain exactly 100 years ago as Zeppelins attacked the east coast

The two Zeppelins were aiming to bomb industrial targets in Humberside but ended up being blown down towards Norfolk, where they attacked King's Lynn (pictured) and Great Yarmouth

Devastation: Four were killed in the bombings which also caused damage in surrounding villages

The bombing raid killed four, injured 16 and caused more than £7,000 worth of damage to the towns and surrounding villages.

Military historian Steve Smith said it marked a change in the face of conflict, with the Zeppelin air raids going on to claim 435 British lives in the First World War

The bombings served as a forewarning of what was to come during the Blitz in the Second World War, he said.

Speaking of the attacks a century ago, Mr Smith said: 'Both pilots found themselves completely lost.

'The first realised he was over Norfolk and used landmarks such as Happisburgh lighthouse to skilfully navigate his way down the coast to Great Yarmouth, which was a valid strategic target.

'His first bomb fell in a field but a further 10 hit targets in the town.

'The other still thought he was over the Humber and dropped bombs on pretty much random targets like the towns of Sheringham and Hunstanton along the north Norfolk coast.

'It was only by chance that he happened upon King's Lynn where he claimed two lives and caused a significant amount of damage.

'He then tried to navigate back over land and ended up above Norwich but fortunately by that point, he had run out of bombs.' 

The Kaiser had banned the bombing of London because of the potential of harming the Royal family, to whom he was related, but sanctioned attacks on industrial targets.

There had been previous attempts at raids on the UK using rickety biplanes, Mr Smith added, but these were largely unsuccessful.

The bombing raid killed four, injured 16 and caused more than £7,000 worth of damage to the towns and surrounding villages

As the attacks became more frequent, Britain's defences improved with many Zeppelins shot down, such as this one near London in 1916

One such attack resulted in a bomb landing in the sea off the Kent coast and another blew a gardener, who amazingly survived, out of a tree in Dover while was removing Christmas decorations.

Previous successful raids on Belgium and Paris meant the British Government knew what was coming.

Mr Smith added: 'In many ways the early Zeppelin raids did us a favour.

'We improved black-out procedures and held back planes from the Western Front to defend our own shores.

'Many of the techniques used to defend us during the First World War were later imitated during the Blitz.' 

A parliamentary inquiry was held into the UK's defences and led to the creation of the nation's first fighter direction system - which proved vital in the Battle of Britain.

By the end of the war, an estimated £1.4million worth of damage was caused to the UK - but it was nowhere near the widespread impact the Germans had hoped for. 

'People were obviously wary but it didn't cause widespread panic,' Mr Smith said.

'It served more as a warning which galvanised the British public to be vigilant.'

In another twist of fate the last raid of the war also happened off Norfolk when Peter Strasser, chief commander of the Germany Imperial Navy Zeppelins, and his crew were shot down on August 5 1918 during a night raid.
