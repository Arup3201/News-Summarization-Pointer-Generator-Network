A British diver has set a new world record for the longest warm water scuba dive by spending more than two days underwater.

Sean McGahern, 38, managed to eat, drink and sleep during his 49 hours and 56 minutes at the bottom of the Mediterranean in Malta.

He remained submerged despite enduring strong winds, currents, surge and one metre waves to complete his impressive feat.

Sean, originally from Brighton, East Sussex, kept himself busy by cleaning up the debris that had accumulated on the bottom of the seabed at St George's Bay.

He spent hours removing rubble including bottles and deck chairs, which were brought up to the surface by the dive team from World Record Diving Malta team and the St. John's Rescue Corp, who assisted him in his record breaking attempt.

His fiancee and fellow diver Mikaela Papagiorcopulo kept him company and offered kisses of encouragement to help him complete his dive.

Exhausted from a long day's diving, Sean, who has over 2,000 dives under his belt, got some much needed rest on a make-shift sun lounger chained down on the sea bed.

He joked and smiled as he emerged from the waters exhausted but ecstatic at his feat and spent the day celebrating.Â

Sean managed to beat the previous record set by Will Goodman in 2010 which stood at 48 hours, 8 minutes and seven seconds by over an hour.

The dive was completed in aid of charity Inspire, who provide therapy, education and leisure services to people with disabilities in Malta and Gozo.

Impressively, Sean also holds the longest open water saltwater scuba dive in cold water, which stands at 12 hours, 34 minutes. He has held that record since March 2012.

His latest dive was more successful than an attempt to break his own saltwater record back in March. Sean was taken to hospital after just a couple of hours underwater when he went into hypothermic shock after his suit started letting in water.
