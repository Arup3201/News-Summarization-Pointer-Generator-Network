Anthony Hamilton is the man his son Lewis could not live with, but is now discovering he is someone he cannot live without.

During what was the most extraordinary young career motor racing has ever known, Hamilton Snr was the other, no-less important half of the partnership.

It was Anthony who provided the bristling competitiveness that railed against any notion that he and his precocious elder son were second to anyone.

Family business: Lewis and Anthony Hamilton thrived in the early years at McLaren, winning a world championship in their second season in Formula One

Pushy for his family, his mind always alert to the next opportunity, an advocate of the highest standards, nobody, including McLaren with all their money that nurtured Lewis’s talent, did more to shape the man who is currently fighting for his second Formula One World Championship title.

When Lewis strayed, as he was wont to do, Anthony brought him in line. A trifling but revealing incident: I remember when Lewis was in a bad mood after a grand prix in Germany and wanted to avoid his media commitments. Anthony joined him in the Mercedes that Lewis wanted to act as his get-away car. A few minutes later Lewis got out and returned to the McLaren motorhome. Anthony said to me: ‘I have told him to go back in there and do his job.’

Who is offering the same instruction since Lewis dismissed his father four years ago? Not Mercedes, who treat him with kid gloves.

Were Anthony still Lewis’s manager, would he have allowed him to take a dog into the paddock?Would he have allowed him to fly so many tiring long-haul journeys to and from America?

Would he have indulged Lewis’s distracting associations with rappers and the wider celebrity whirl?

No, no, no.

In the shade: Anthony Hamilton was fiercely protective of his eldest son, as several anecdotes reveal

It is not sustainable to suggest – as Mercedes’s yes-men do – that his lifestyle has no impact on his performance. He is operating in a sport that separates the best from the next best by the smallest of margins. It is unimaginable that Lewis, had he developed his talent as he ought, would be sitting second in the table to Nico Rosberg, a decent driver indeed but one who holds the upper hand only by dint of dedicating himself wholly to the task at hand.

Nor is this season a one-off. Lewis was out-scored by Jenson Button in their three years together at McLaren. That is a remarkable statistic when one remembers the extent of the young Lewis’s talent and success.

The best book written among the flurry of biographies that accompanied Lewis’s early transcendent arrival in Formula One is Mark Hughes’ Lewis Hamilton: The Full Story. It alone saw the full significance of Anthony in the rise of Lewis.

I repeat here a telling vignette from the Hamiltons appearance on Blue Peter in 1997. Lewis had uncharacteristically finished fifth in a kart race. Anthony asks him: ‘What’s it doing? Is it gripping up?’ Lewis, lost in thought, shakes his head occasionally and they walk back to the paddock in silence.‘I’m unable to do absolutely anything,’ says Anthony, ‘because you’re not telling me what’s happening.’ They walk on again, silent once more.

The camera cuts, as Hughes recalls, and returns to Lewis some time later. ‘My dad’s pretty hard on me,’ he says. ‘And when it’s not going to plan he’s even harder. But we’re a team and we work together.’

Lewis then thinks again and adds: ‘If my dad gave me advice about the track I wouldn’t take it because he doesn’t know what it’s like out there. I didn’t really give dad much advice (about the karting problem) but I’ve told him now and I think he’d going to try the old settings.’ Lewis won the next race by miles.

Their closeness and their friction produced results. Nothing can replicate that bond.

Staring into space: Hamilton trails Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg by 29 points

I 
understand that Lewis wants to be his own man and escape his father’s 
control. That is natural, and it may help him in the long term.

But
 if I were Lewis Hamilton and I was really more serious about winning 
the world title than anything else, I would ditch Simon Fuller’s 
management, swallow my pride and ask Anthony to come back as my manager,
 travelling companion, conscience and truest supporter.

Lewis may well win this year’s championship but even to think that he might not, tells you how much Anthony is missed.
