Jamie Carragher says Liverpool must forget about Luis Suarez and get their new strikers firing instead.

The Reds have got off to a poor start to campaign without the Uruguayan following his summer switch to Barcelona, while they have also missed the injured Daniel Sturridge.

Suarez smashed 31 goals in all competitions for Liverpool last season as their title bid fell just short.

New arrival Mario Balotelli is yet to find the net in the Premier League for his new club

However, Brendan Rodgers' side are already 12 points off the pace, with summer signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert yet to find the net in the Premier League.

'It's a massive problem,' Carragher told Monday Night Football.

'People need to stop talking about Suarez, move on and look at what you've got.

'Brendan Rodgers came out and said they are not a one man team, but week by week they are showing Liverpool were at times a one man team. The stats are damning.'

Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini have failed to fire for Liverpool so far this season

The Reds slumped to defeat at Newcastle on Saturday - their fourth league loss in the opening 10 games.

Liverpool have already leaked 13 goals, and Carragher reckons individual blunders are costing them.

He added: 'If you have defenders making mistakes, how do you rectify it? Are defenders more interested being on the front foot?'

Jamie Carragher says Liverpool must do better at both ends of the pitch following a poor start
