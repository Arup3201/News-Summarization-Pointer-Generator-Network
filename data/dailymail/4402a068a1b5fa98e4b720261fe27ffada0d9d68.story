A heavy sleeper in a Phoenix hotel room was inches away from not waking up at all.

The man heard loud noises at around 2 am on Friday morning but was 'disoriented and thought the people above were doing something dumb' so went back to sleep.

It was only in the morning that he discovered his room at the Hilton Phoenix was riddled with bullet holes and he had been lucky to survive.

The slumberer, known only as Reddit user 'walterwhitmanwhite', then posted several photos to the site entitled: 'I nearly got shot last night and I didn't even know it.'

A man slept through several gunshots that peppered his hotel room, dismissing the disruption as noisy neighbors

The Redditor known only as walterwhitmanwhite found this bullet by the side of his bed when he woke up in the morning

The incident happened at the Hilton Suites in Phoenix, but man doesn't want the hotel getting any 'bad publicity'

Walterwhitmanwhite explained the incredible episode on Reddit: 'This is in an all-suite corporate hotel in a business plaza with 24hr security and cameras.'

'All the bullets must have passed within a couple of feet of me. One might even have hit the side of the bed. The cop found the bullet in the photo next to the bed.'

The man claims he did hear some disruption: 'I heard it and woke up in a panic. But at 2am in a strange place you are disoriented and I could only vaguely guess that something loud had happened in the room above.

'After all how many people would immediately guess that someone had fired shots through their hotel room? So I just went to the bathroom and went back to sleep.'

Several bullets ricocheted round the man's hotel room, but he dismissed it as noisy neighbors

One bullet ended up perilously close to his bed

The man explained: 'Two of the bullets ricocheted off the ceiling and embedded themselves in the internal wall and doorframe that you see'

The Redditor had a lucky escape as the bullets bounced around his room: 'Two of the bullets ricocheted off the ceiling and embedded themselves in the internal wall and doorframe that you see.

'The third "tumbled" (so the cop said -- I don't know anything about guns) and landed on the other side of the bed next to the window. That was the one he found.'

Sergeant Tommy Thompson of the Phoenix Police Department emailed TheBlaze and confirmed that someone did fire 'several shots' through the 
west windows of the Hilton Phoenix Suites at around 2:30 a.m. Friday 
morning.

'No one was injured and it is unknown who or why the shots were
fired. We don’t know what type of gun was used either,' Thompson admitted.

The officer explained to TheBlaze that he didn’t expect to have any further details in the near future. When the website asked if there was any evidence to suggest 
involvement of Mexican drug cartels, which are active in Phoenix, Thompson replied 'absolutely not.'

The man only noticed something was odd when he saw damage to the hotel room in the morning

In the morning the man said: 'I took my time getting ready this morning. The hotel offered me another room but why bother? The shooter isn't coming back'

On Reddit, Walterwhitmanwhite was relaxed about the incident, claiming: 'I took my time getting ready this morning. The hotel offered me another room but why bother? The shooter isn't coming back. Nobody knows who did it or why but the cop's guess was it was a random drive-by as part of a gang initiation.'

When other Redditors tried to persuade to him to demand compensation from Hilton, the man claimed he didn't 'want to give the hotel bad publicity. It wasn't their fault.'

Walterwhitmanwhite took a fair view: 'Part of me wants free stuff cos, you 
know, FREE STUFF! But the hotel was not negligent. It's not like the 
gunman was inside the hotel property or anything, and they responded 
appropriately.'

'They offered me enough loyalty points to cover the night's stay. I guess that is fair.'

Later he added: 'Happy to tell you I got the full 
breakfast buffet with smoked salmon and everything! But that was in my 
room rate anyway so it wasn't a bonus for nearly getting shot.'

The man had a very lucky escape
