The skinny: New York City's narrowest house, which is 9.5 feet wide and 30 feet deep, has found a buyer

It may only be 8ft 4 inches wide, but one of New York's thinnest houses has sold for $3.25million dollars.

While the three story town house may not seem value for money with a measly 990 square foot of space in all.

But this home has a history.

The property, on Bedford Street in Greenwich Village, is where playwright and poet Edna St Vincent Millay wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning Ballad Of The Harp-Weaver in the early 1920s.

Since Ms Millay vacated the property, a host of other celebrities have lived at the property including actors John Barrymore and Cary Grant.

Other well-known former residents of the house, which has become something of an attraction on the tourist trail, include children's writer Ann McGovern and anthropologist Margaret Meade.

The house even inspired Ms McGovern, who lived there for seven years, to write Mr Skinner's Skinny House, a children's book about a man who struggles to find someone to live with him in the city's thinnest house.

She said on her website: 'Once I saw a man who was standing in front of the house with arms outstretched.

‘"Hey," he said. "I’m as big as a house," and he was.'

Despite its tiny size, the house boasts three bedrooms, two baths, four wood burning fireplaces and a secret garden.

A narrow spiral staircase runs through the house.

It was originally built by its neighbor around 1850, simply to fill in a carriage entrance way that led to the stables behind the property.

Since then, it has served as a shoemaker's shop and a candy factory, before being transformed for residential use.

The now-legendary skinny house, which is a regular attraction on New York walking tours, came close to demolition in 1950, before a lawyer stepped in to save it and its neighbors from being razed.

Home sweet home: The kitchen, which has modern appliances and marble tabletops, looks out onto the large, narrow back garden which is 42 feet long and nearly ten feet wide

Notable residents: The three-story townhouse is legendary for its size and its famous past inhabitants, which include actors Cary Grant and John Barrymore, poet Edna St Vincent Millay and anthropologist Margaret Mead

Greenery: A private balcony in the master bathroom look onto the back garden, which dates back to 1850

It was sold for $2.175million in 2010 before being put on the market for nearly double - $4.3million - after a renovation in 2011.

The asking price was cut to $3.495 last year.

A description of house on the Town Real Estate website, where the house was listed, says: 'The Millay House exemplifies the artistic heritage and cultural fabric of this fabled neighborhood.

'The residence has just been meticulously renovated with beautiful modern finishes, yet retains its original character and pedigree.'

It continues: 'Whether cozying up by the fireplace or enjoying the garden as a summer respite, this is truly a house for all seasons.'

Design: Photos of the one-of-a-kind home, which is a regular attraction on many New York walking tours, show its sleek interiors, with exposed beams and large French windows
