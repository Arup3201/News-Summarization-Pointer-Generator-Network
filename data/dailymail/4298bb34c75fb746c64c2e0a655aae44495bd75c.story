Kate McCann told a court today that her young son asked her about allegations by a former Portuguese police chief that she killed her daughter Madeleine.

Mrs McCann was delivering a personal statement at Lisbon's Palace of Justice in the libel case brought by her and husband Gerry against Goncalo Amaral, a former police chief.

He made the claims in a book about their role in the disappearance of their daughter from the family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve in 2007.

More pain: Kate and Gerry McCann arrive in Lisbon, Portugal, to give statements to the libel trial of former detective Goncalo Amaral whose book suggested they hid their daughter's body after she died in an accident

She told the court her son Sean heard about Amaral's allegations on the radio while travelling on the school bus.

'Sean asked me in October, "Mr Amaral said you killed Madeleine". I just said that he said a lot of silly things,' she said.

Sean and his twin sister Amelie were aged two when Madeleine, who was nearly four, went missing.

The
 McCanns arrived back in Portugal this morning for the latest hearing in
 their ongoing libel trial against a former police chief.

The
 couple hoped they would be able to deliver personal statements to the 
trial after they were thwarted last month when the case was adjourned.

Mr
 and Mrs McCann previously criticised Amaral for what they claimed was a
 'blatant and cynical' attempt to hold up the trial after he removed 
powers from his lawyer on the morning they were due to make statements 
about the effect allegations in his book had had on them.

The couple had travelled to Lisbon on 
what was due to be the last day of the long-running trial over Mr 
Amaral's book The Truth Of The Lie, but the case was adjourned in the 
wake of the former detective's application.

After
 that earlier hearing they spoke of their anger, accusing him of trying 
to wear them down and delaying justice for their missing daughter.

Madeleine
 disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the 
Algarve on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with
 friends.

The McCanns are suing for libel over 
claims made in Mr Amaral's 2008 book, including suggestions that they 
hid Madeleine's body after she died in an accident and faked an 
abduction.

They say the allegations damaged the hunt for their daughter and exacerbated their anguish.

If
 successful, the family stand to gain around Â£1million in damages. A 
judgment is not expected in the trial until later this year.

The couple's latest visit to Portugal 
comes after Scotland Yard detectives last week returned to the country 
to help interview suspects in the case.

Officers
 from the force's Operation Grange joined their Portuguese counterparts 
in Faro last week as they interviewed people of interest in relation to 
Madeleine's disappearance in 2007.

The
 suspects were believed to include three workers from the Ocean Club in 
Praia da Luz who have been linked to a string of burglaries in the area 
before Madeleine's disappearance.

The
 return of British detectives came after they joined their Portuguese 
counterparts last month in searches of three areas of land near to where
 Madeleine went missing.

After
 the searches, police said it was the 'first phase of this major 
investigation which has been agreed with the Portuguese' but that there 
was 'still a substantial amount of work yet to be completed in the 
coming weeks and months'.

Mr and Mrs McCann previously said that
 the fact police found no evidence relating to their missing daughter 
had reinforced their belief that she could still be alive.
