More than half of the witnesses to a brawl outside a nightclub that has been closed down following the fight had criminal records.

Essence club in Kingston-upon-Thames, south west London, was forced to close on Monday after a licensing committee meeting said it attracted 'the lowest of the low'.

The 11-hour hearing also heard how, when a 30-man brawl took place outside the club in December, over a hundred witnesses to the crime had previous convictions - including murder and sexual assault.

The council ordered the club to be shut down immediately - but its owner has 21 days to appeal.

The fight broke out last year after two groups of party-goers left the venue.

During the fight, which was caught on camera by a doorman, some revellers picked up scaffolding poles before using them as weapons.

Two men were left with serious head wounds and were in need of hospital treatment.

When police rounded up club-goers as witnesses, they found of the 210 they spoke to ‘more than half had criminal convictions.’

The hearing was also told it ‘attracts the lowest of the low’.

The witnesses' convictions included manslaughter, attempted murder, possession of firearms and ammunition, sexual assault, robbery, burglary, drug dealing, and assault on police.

The owner of the club, Franco Lumba, was represented at the meeting by Michael Bromley-Martin QC, who told the hearing the music was to blame for ‘attracting persons involved in gang affiliations’.

He said the club could be turned round and that the situation could be fixed if the licence was not revoked, local media reported today.

Councillor Stephen Brister, who chaired the meeting of the licensing sub-committee, told Mr Lumba: 'As the licence holder you are responsible for achieving the licensing objectives.'

Chief Inspector Gary Taylor of Kingston police said of the brawl in December: 'It’s the biggest act of civil disobedience I’ve ever seen in Kingston.

Speaking after the licence was revoked, he said: 'We only take premises to expedited review in extreme circumstances. The right decision was reached.”

Kingston police borough commander Glenn Tunstall said 'I am pleased that Kingston’s licensing sub committee recognised the gravity of the disorder that my officers faced at Essence nightclub on the night in question.

'The situation faced by my officers on the early hours of Saturday morning was totally unacceptable and both the residents of Kingston and those who visit our night-time economy have a right to expect better.'

According to the club’s website it is Kingston’s 'most exclusive venue...which has single-handedly transformed the nightlife in the town'.

It states that tables can be booked providing you guarantee to spend £350 or more.

A 75cl bottle of Dom Perignon cost £200, a magnum of Grey Goose vodka cost £265 and a 70cl bottle of Jack Daniels would set you back £120.
