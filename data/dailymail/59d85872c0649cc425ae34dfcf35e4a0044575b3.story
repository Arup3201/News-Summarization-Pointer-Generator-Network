Laurence Fishburne is a multimillionaire actor with roles on hit shows on both ABC and NBC and a part in the upcoming 'Superman v. Batman: Dawn of Justice.' 

His 80-year-old mother, meanwhile, is broke and facing eviction - and her successful son refuses to call her, she told the New York Post. 

'He's gone Hollywood.  For 20 years, I funded my son’s career. He promised me he would take care of me. ... To this day, I have not got a Christmas present or a "Thank you, Mama" present. He hasn’t given me a penny,' Hattie Crawford Fishburne told the newspaper.

Laurence Fishburne's mother Hattie, pictured with her son on the red carpet in 1999, says she is facing eviction and hasn't heard from her son in over a year

She says she's living on $3,000 a month from social security and her pension from years of teaching in public schools in Brooklyn and Los Angeles. 

Mrs Fisburne says she's struggling to pay her medical expenses from her arthritis, underactive thyroid, high cholesterol and injuries she sustained in a massive car crash. 

Montana Fishburne's father reportedly stopped speaking with her she made two porn videos

She's now so far behind on the $1,500-a-month rent on her Los Angeles apartment that she's be evicted on Tuesday, she told the Post. 

Despite her attempts to reach her son Laurence, she hasn't spoken to him in more than a year, she says. 

A call to Fishburne's publicist by Daily Mail Online was not immediately returned.

Fishburne, who played the iconic character of Morpheus on the 'Matrix' trilogy, is worth an estimated $20million and earns $175,000 per episode of the NBC show 'Hannibal,' according to CelebrityNetWorth.com. 

In addition to 'Hannibal,' the 53-year-old actor also stars in and produces ABC's 'Black-ish' and is reprising his role of Daily Planet editor Perry White in the new 'Superman v. Batman' role. 

In 1994, Mrs Fishburne went to the press with reports she was being evicted from her home in Brooklyn, where she had raised her son as a single mother.

Laurence was a child star, appearing on state at age 10 and in soap operas by 12. At age 14, he lied his way into a role in 'Apocalypse Now' by claiming he was 18. 

The father-of-three has had other estrangements from his family, according to the Post. His daughter Montana says he stopped speaking to her when it emerged she was appearing in porn videos. She was last reported to be working as a stripper in Texas.
