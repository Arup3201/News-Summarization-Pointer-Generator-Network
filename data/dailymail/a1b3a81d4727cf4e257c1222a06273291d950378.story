This is the moment a man attacked a police officer with a shovel at the start of a tussle which ended with him being shot dead.

James Barker, 42, was caught by the officer's body camera swinging the implement at him from a porch in Salt Lake City, Utah, just one street away from Barker's home.

The footage shows the officer - who has not been named - sprawling onto the floor before further blows rain down from above.

Lashing out: James Barker, 42, was filmed swinging his snow shovel at a police officer in Salt Lake City, Utah, at the beginning of a fight which would end with him being shot dead

Threats: Barker had brandished the shovel after a confrontation over what he said was his snow removal business. He shouted at the officer, was pushed, then hit him with the shovel, fracturing several bones

In the ensuing fight, the policeman drew his pistol and shot Barker dead. A witness to the confrontation on Thursday afternoon said he was hit three times in the stomach.

The camera did not capture the shooting as it was damaged during the shovel attack and stopped filming.

It followed a heated argument between the officer and Barker, who got angry when the officer confronted him with reports he was acting suspiciously.

Barker said he was trying to drum up customers for his snow-clearing business, and got angry when the officer kept questioning him and asked for his name.

He eventually shouted at the officer that he was just 'trying to do my business'. The camera seems to show the officer push Barker away after he shouts and points - at which point he threatens him with the shovel then swings it. 

Anger: In the conversation, during which Barker refused to give his name, he shouted at the officer that he was only doing 'my business'

Aggressive: He pointed at the officer and told him to get back in his car and drive away

The footage shows the officer get out of his patrol car and approach the man, who claimed to be offering to clear snow from houses in a suburb of the city - despite there being little snow on the ground.

The officer said: ''I've had a couple of people call about you saying we don't have any snow to be removed - I wonder what you're doing in the area... I've had neighbors call saying they saw you looking in cars yesterday.'

Barker claimed to have a business license but wouldn't give details, or tell the officer his name when asked. He later said he was looking for business ahead of time for when it snowed again.

When questioned and asked again for his name - then threatened with arrest - he shouted repeatedly: 'I'm doing my business', then said 'I'm trying to make a living.'

The police officer radios for backup, and tells Barker to calm down. When he doesn't, the officer pushes him back, and Barker retaliates.

Push: The officer was filmed pushing Barker back - at which point he retaliates with the shovel, knocking the officer over

Witness Richard Grow said saw the two men fighting on the ground, before the officer shot Barker three times in the stomach.

He told Fox13: 'One guy flies off the porch, somebody else flies off the porch and lands on him

'I’m thinking this must be two roommates who came out of the house and are going to settle on the lawn. But then next thing I saw, he pulled out a gun and shot him.'

A statement from Salt Lake City police said: 'A resident called police about a suspicious man asking people in the area if he could shovel the snow off their walks for money.

'An officer responded and made contact with him. Soon after the man attacked the officer, hitting him several times with the shovel. The officer drew his handgun and shot the man, killing him.

'The deceased is James Barker, 42, a Salt Lake City resident. The officer was transported to the hospital and found to have multiple fractures. He was treated and released.'

Last footage: The camera, pointing up in this frame, showed more blows from the shovel before it was damaged and stopped filming. Barker was shot seconds later

Barker's court records show he was arrested and booked into jail for disturbing the peace and failing to give police his identity, KSL.com reported, but no major or violent crimes.

The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated by Salt Lake City police and the DA's office.

Protesters rallied in Salt Lake City Saturday afternoon to denounce the shooting, which the characterized as unnecessary.

The Utah Against Police Brutality activist group said: 'We believe that if the police take a life, they should not investigate themselves... The shooting of James Barker is yet another case which should be handled by an impartial third-party with no departmental affiliations.'

However, a spokesman for the Utah Fraternal Order of Police said the video demonstrates a clear example of an officer doing his job.

The spokesman said: 'Officers have a job to do, and frankly the amount of victim-blaming on the officer is ridiculous and doesn't leave much air in the room for a rational discussion. That officer did nothing to provoke such an aggravated assault.'
