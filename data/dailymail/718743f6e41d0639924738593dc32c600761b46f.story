A judge will wait until jury selection begins to determine whether to move the first-degree murder trial of a man accused of killing a teenager during an argument over loud music.

Michael Dunn's attorneys on Thursday asked the court to move the case out of Jacksonville, Florida over concerns that intense local media coverage would make it impossible to find a fair jury.

Circuit Court Judge Russell Healey said he will rule on any move after jury selection begins. It is scheduled for September 22.

The 47-year-old Dunn was convicted of three counts of attempted second-degree murder and firing into an occupied vehicle.

He faces a minimum 60-year prison sentence, but the jury deadlocked on the first-degree murder charge for killing 17-year-old Jordan Davis.

Jurors deadlocked in February on the first-degree murder charge against Michael Dunn, 47, in the shooting of the teenager outside a Jacksonville convenience store in November 2012.

Jordan Davis was shot dead in 2012 at a convenience store in Jacksonville, Florida 

Dunn showed no emotion as the verdicts were read earlier this year. Davis' parents each left the courtroom in tears. 

Ronald Davis also appeared at court on Thursday morning in Jacksonville for Dunn's hearing.

During the trial, prosecutor Erin Wolfson told jurors that Dunn's 'blood started to boil' because of the vehicle-rattling 'thug music' coming from the SUV.

Dunn claimed the music, which he described as 'rap c**p', was so loud it hurt his ears and caused his car to vibrate.

Dunn claimed he acted in self-defense, testifying he thought he saw a firearm pointed at him from the SUV as Davis yelled insults at him and the argument escalated. No weapon was found in the SUV.

Dunn told jurors he feared for his life, perceiving 'this was a clear and present danger.' Dunn, who has a concealed weapons permit, fired 10 shots, hitting the vehicle nine times.

Prosecutors contended that Dunn opened fire because he felt disrespected by Davis.

Dunn escalated the confrontation and fired in premeditated fashion because a teenager had disrespected him, the prosecutor said. 

She said: 'This defendant was disrespected by a 17-year-old teenager, and he lost it. He wasn't happy with Jordan Davis' attitude. What was his response? ''You're not going to talk to me like that.'"

'He took these actions because it was premeditated. It was not self-defense.'

However, Dunn's attorney argued that his client used legitimate self-defense after Davis let forth with an expletive-laced threat and rebuffed the prosecution's claim that Dunn was 'a madman with a gun'.

The teen made his friend turn the hip hop music back up after they initially turned it down at Dunn's request. Dunn was parked in the spot next to the SUV outside the convenience store.

That defendant didn't shoot into a carful of kids to save his life. He shot into it to save his pride,' Assistant State Attorney John Guy told the jury earlier in the week.

'Jordan Davis didn't have a weapon, he had a big mouth.'

The trial was the latest Florida case to raise questions about self-defense and race, coming six months after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, about 125 miles south of Jacksonville.

The Dunn trial was prosecuted by the same State Attorney's Office that handled the Zimmerman case.
