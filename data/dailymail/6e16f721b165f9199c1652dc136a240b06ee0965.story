A Baltimore man dubbed the 'Dine and Dasher' who fakes seizures to avoid paying his bill has finally been arrested after another spree of runaway meals.

But restaurant owners and cops fear Andrew Palmer, 46, will soon be back on the run to short-change more Baltimore eateries.

The Baltimore Sun reports that Palmer was arrested on Monday after he refused to pay a $50 bill at Viccino Jay's Italian Gourmet on Charles Street, Baltimore.

Andrew Palmer, 46, is the Baltimore man dubbed the "Dine and Dasher" by police. He has become notorious for racking up food and drink tabs at area restaurants, then faking seizures to get out of paying the bill

On Saturday night, Palmer faked a seizure at barbecue restaurant Oliver Speck's in the city's Harbor East section when he was presented with a bill for $90 tab.

'The paramedics showed up and said, "Looks like our guy's back,"' Oliver Speck's chef Jesse Sandlin told The Sun. 'He would not wake up, and they were like, "Come on Andy, stop faking."'

Palmer, who is listed as homeless, has been arrested on more than 90 occasions and found guilty of petty theft at least eight times in the past year, The Sun reported.

The problem facing prosecutors is that theft under $100 comes with such a comparatively small penalty that there is no effective deterrent for someone willing to run the risk of getting caught.

The Admiral's Cup restaurant, seen here in an image from Google Street View, was targeted by Palmer. Police say the scammer had three Stoli Oranges here then went into the back of the Fells Point restaurant where he appeared to have a seizure

Palmer's crime spree reads like a Zagat's review of Baltimore's best restaurants. In December, police say Palmer had the $24.99 shrimp platter and four alcoholic drinks at the Inner Harbor's Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory.

In January, Palmer ate at Sullivan's Steakhouse, and ordered the chicken piccata with a lobster add-on, a 22-ounce ribeye steak, four Blue Moon beers, three Bacardis and coffee.

He faked a seizure to avoid the $160 check and was arrested.

Palmer was arrested early on Monday after restaurant owners said he refused to pay a $50 bill at Viccino Jay's Italian Gourmet on Charles Street, in Baltimore, pictured here. The notorious Baltimore dine-and-dasher has more than 90 arrests on his record

A police statement read: 'Palmer's seizure occurred when he was confronted about his unpaid bill as he exited the restaurant. [Palmer is] well known to local restaurants and members of the Baltimore Police Department.'

Palmer was sentenced to one year in jail for that incident but was released in July. He celebrated his early release by drinking at the Union Brewing Company where he had three Blue Moon drafts, an espresso martini, and two more beers plus three Stoli Oranges at the Admiral's Cup.

He then faked a seizure in an attempt to avoid a $72 check.

'If this guy came up and mugged me on the street and took $90 from me, he would've gotten arrested,' Jesse Sandlin, chef at Oliver Speck's, said.
