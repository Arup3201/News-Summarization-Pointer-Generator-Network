At a fleeting glance, these pictures look like a windsurfer impressively speeding across choppy waters.

But on closer inspection this isn't your standard windsurfer - he's skating across sheets of thick ice.

Hungarian Zsombor Berecz clearly isn't one to be deterred by sub-zero temperatures from showing off his impressive surfing skills.

Dardevil: Hungarian Olympic sailor Zsombor Berecz takes to the ice on Lake Balaton, Keszthely, to show off his ice windsurfing skills

Athlete: Zsombor is slightly more accustomed to the water than the ice - he competed in the men's laser class sailing at last summer's London Olympics and the 2008 games in Beijing

Perfect conditions: Hungarians can only skate on the lake for one week of the year when the ice is thick enough and the snow is not too deep

He took to the ice on Lake Balaton, Keszthely, Hungary, to take part in the extreme sport and reach frightening speeds of almost 40mph.

Dardevil Zsombor is slightly more accustomed to the water than the ice - he competed in the men's laser class sailing at last summer's London Olympics and the 2008 games in Beijing.

But he manages to make the ice surfing look easy in these stunning images.

The shots were captured by fellow Hungarian Gabor Turcsi, 30, who says he likes to keep a minimalist style when snapping extreme sports.

He said: 'I look for simple compositions. Every pixel has to count, to leave its mark and emotion.

'In sports photography I look for action, strength and a challenge. I like to seize the moment in the heart of the battle.

Stunning: Ice at the vast frozen lake is between 15 and 20 cm thick when ice surfers take to it each year

Balance: Surfers keep their balance by using smaller boards than when windsurfing and attaching ice skating-type blades to the bottom of the board

Dangerous: Zsombor Berecz dangles perilously close to the ice as he reaches speeds of almost 40mph on the lake

'Then I concentrate on the faces, muscles and on the details that give the idea of the effort and strain being exerted.

'A picture is worth something when it can give you an emotion every time you look at it.'

The sport, invented by frustrated Canadian windsurfers during a particularly harsh winter, is something of a hybrid of wind surfing, ice yachting and snow boarding.

Riders can reach staggering speeds of 70mph and - like windsurfing - there are no brakes.

The Hungarian ice speed record is a slightly slower 55mph.

Some ice windsurfers even claim to have hit 90mph on a particularly windy day.

A smaller board is used than regular windsurfing and riders balance and glide by attaching ice-skate type blades to the bottom.

Hungarians
can only windsurf on the lake for one week each year when the ice, at 
15-20cm deep, is thick enough and the snow is not too deep.

Extreme sport: Ice windsurfing, or snowfering, was invented by frustrated windsurfers in Canada when they were experiencing a particularly harsh winter

Fast: The Hungarian ice surfing speed record stands at 55mph, but some surfers in other countries say they have hit at least 90mph
