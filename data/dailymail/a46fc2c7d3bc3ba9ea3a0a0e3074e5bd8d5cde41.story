A vigilante border patrol group has sworn that it will continue guarding the U.S.-Mexico border despite the death of its neo-Nazi leader in a horrific murder-suicide.

Friends of Jason Todd 'JT' Ready vowed Friday that U.S. Border Guard's armed patrols will continue, but monitoring groups doubted the operations could be sustained.

Authorities say the 39-year-old Ready shot and killed his girlfriend and three others, including a toddler, before killing himself in a Phoenix suburb on Wednesday in a murder-suicide which stemmed from domestic violence.

It has now emerged that he was being investigated by the FBI over terrorism claims and allegations he had stolen weapons from the military.

Victims: Amber Mederos with her daughter Lilly, two, were shot and killed as was Ready's girlfriend Lisa Mederos, 47, who had been living with him at the time; Ready then turned the gun on himself

The Arizona Republic reported on its 
website Saturday that the FBI was already conducting a domestic 
terrorism investigation into Ready's activities prior to the shootings.

James Turgal, special agent in charge
of the FBI's Phoenix office, told the paper that the FBI's 
investigation dated to when Ready was a member of the neo-Nazi National 
Socialist Movement and continued into his participation with the border 
group.

He stressed that it had nothing to do with this week's shootings.

However, the FBI probe into Ready's activities as head of the Border Guard could cast doubt on the remaining members' vows to continue his legacy.

An affidavit accused him of possessing weapons which were 'most likely stolen from the military as they are illegal to possess and not available to the civilian market'.

Coupled with the labelling of the Border Guard as a 'hate group' by anti-racism bodies, the revelations could make it increasingly difficult for the border vigilantes to continue their patrols without attracting the attention of authorities

But Sean Rose, a 35-year-old Tucson man 
who said Ready was like a brother to him, said he would quit his job to 
keep the group going.

'He did a lot for this country as far
as protecting the border, something the government doesn't do,' Rose 
said. 'I think it's good to have civilians stopping the drug market.'

Groups that monitor the activities of
organizations like the U.S. Border Guard expressed doubts that it will 
be able to maintain its operations. Without Ready's leadership, they 
say, the Border Guard will likely disappear.

'The U.S. Border Guard is probably 
finished,' said Mark Potok of the anti-hate group, the Southern Poverty 
Law Center. 'It really did revolve around JT Ready.'

An SPLC recent report said that 
'nativist extremist' groups like Ready's decreased by almost half in 
2011 to 184 groups, down from a high of 319 such groups in 2010.

The Minuteman Project and other 
similar groups have been plagued by infighting and financial 
difficulties, largely splintering or disintegrating altogether.

The movement's decline comes as states
like Arizona passed harsh immigration laws that included provisions 
allowing local police to question a person's immigration status while 
enforcing other laws, Potok said.

Those laws created an impression 
among some civilian border militia members that state governments were 
doing more about illegal immigration, and that they no longer had to, he
said.

Jennifer Allen, interim director the 
Arizona chapter of the immigrant advocacy group, the Southern Border 
Communities Coalition, said that organizations like Ready's thrive on a 
charismatic leader, and tend to implode once that leader is gone.

'What brings hate groups together is 
anger and fear. So it makes sense that they would start to direct that 
toward one another,' she said. 'They also attract a lot of people that 
want to be mega personalities.

'And it ends up being their own worst enemy — fighting over the limelight,' she said.

The SPLC also cites the case of 
Shawna Forde, a former member of the Minuteman Civil Defence Corps. She 
was convicted in a May 2009 home invasion that left a 9-year-old girl 
and her father dead.

Prosecutors said the invasion was an attempt to steal drug money to fund her group's border operations.

Forde was expelled from the Minuteman
group in 2007 amid allegations of lying and pretending to be a senior 
leader. At the time of the killings, she was the head of her own group 
called the Minutemen American Defence.

The SPLC's report said the killings cast a pall over the entire civilian border militia movement.

But Ready began patrolling the desert
with his group after the killings, dressing up in head-to-toe 
camouflage gear, helmets and boots, and carrying high-powered guns as 
they traveled out into the desert to look for illegal immigrants or 
smugglers.

'After we pay 
our last respects and get our ducks back in a row, I'm pretty sure 
business will continue. I don't think JT would have wanted us to stop.'

Rose said that he never joined the 
group on patrols, but that he and Ready would go out with a handful of 
others about a dozen times a year on similar outings.

Rose and other friends of Ready's 
said they are reluctant to believe that he killed four people and 
himself, and say they feel drug cartels are more likely to blame even 
though police have discounted that possibility.

Police say all the evidence points to a domestic-violence situation.

Those killed in the rampage in 
Gilbert on Wednesday were Ready's girlfriend, her daughter; her 
16-month-old granddaughter; and her daughter's boyfriend.

Harry Hughes, another close friend of
Ready's and a regional director with the Detroit-based National 
Socialist Movement, said he plans to continue his own one-to-two man 
desert patrols.

Members of the National Socialist 
Movement promote white separatism, dress like Nazis and display 
swastikas. They believe only non-Jewish, white heterosexuals should be 
citizens and that anyone who isn't white should leave 'peacefully or by 
force.'

Ready was a former member of the group who said he quit to focus on his desert patrols.

'Just because Mr Ready is no longer 
with us doesn't mean we're going to stop,' Hughes said. 'After we pay 
our last respects and get our ducks back in a row, I'm pretty sure 
business will continue.'

He added, 'I don't think JT would have wanted us to stop.'
