Kieran Gibbs believes that Arsenal's 2-0 victory at Manchester City will have helped to silence some of their critics.

A Santi Cazorla penalty and a header from Giroud stunned the champions and gave Gibbs reasons to be cheerful about the rest of the season. 

Writing in his Sportlobster blog, the defender said: 'I think the win on Sunday has proved a lot of people wrong and we also proved to ourselves that we can have a big say in the Premier League this season.

'It was a clinical game from us and it's the kind of result you get when everyone on the pitch is in sync.'

In recent years, Arsenal have had a poor record against other top-four sides, with Sunday's result their first league win over City since 2012.

And Gibbs believes the win can serve as a catalyst.

'It was a long time coming,' he said. 'We needed a result like that against a top-four team away from home, not only to give the team a boost but also to prove to ourselves we can get results at places like the Etihad.' 

Arsenal are fifth in the Premier League table with 39 points, just one behind Manchester United.
