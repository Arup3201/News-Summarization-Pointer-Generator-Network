Confirmed: Leonid Rozhetskin disappeared five years ago amid fears he was the target of a contract killing from Moscow. A body found in a Latvian wood has been confirmed to be his

Latvian police say they have confirmed the death of a Russian-born British media magnate who disappeared five years ago amid fears he was the target of a contract killing from Moscow.

A corpse found in remote woodland last year has been identified as Leonid Rozhetskin, a jet-setting filmmaker and co-founder of the free London business newspaper City AM.

The flamboyant lawyer and tycoon, the 41-year-old U.S. citizen, disappeared from his villa at the trendy Baltic resort of Jurmala, in March 2008.

At the time he was engulfed in a complex and bitter business dispute with a figure seen as close to President Vladimir Putin.

While murder was immediately suspected after blood was found at his £2million beach-side home, there were rumours supported by Latvia's ex-police chief that Rozhetskin's death had been faked.

It was rumoured he was smuggled abroad and given a new identity possibly by the FBI under a U.S. witness protection programme, in exchange for his knowledge of the business dealings of the Russian political elite.

Several Moscow associates also refused to believe he was dead, and there was a report of an alleged sighting last year in Thailand.

Latvian law enforcement sources confirmed on Saturday that DNA tests on the decomposed remains of a body found in woodland in Tukums Region 15 months ago match with a Rozhetskin relative.

A credit card belonging to Rozhetskin was found on the corpse.

'The DNA profile of the remains was compared with the one of his family members, and they matched,' reported state news agency LETA citing police sources.

The announcement may not quell claims in Russia that he is still alive, though the Latvians are now launching a full-scale murder hunt.

It was unclear why it had taken so long to complete the DNA test, but in the past year Latvian sources expressed frustration with the U.S. authorities over the slow pace of obtaining a sample from Rozhetskin's mother, Elvira, 73, a U.S. resident.

When her son went missing, she immediately claimed he had been murdered because he was committed to exposing corruption in Mr Putin's government. She said at the time: 'My son isn't missing. My son is dead.'

In contrast, the former head of the Latvian police Juris Reksna said: 'I think Rozhetskin is alive.'

He claimed: 'There are too many facts and questions here which don't add up, far too many.'

Shortly before his disappearance, Rozhetskin moved his partner Natalya Belova, a glamorous blonde former model 17 years his junior, and their son Max, then aged three, into a high security £3 million apartment in Central London. 

He had stopped visiting Moscow, where he had been an avid partygoer, telling friends he now feared for his life. He surrounded himself with bodyguards, and made London his home.

While several men were arrested in the aftermath of his disappearance, including a butler with suspected links to the Russian secret services, they were freed 'long ago', said criminal police chief Janis Lazdins.

Latvian police have examined a number of theories over the Rozhetskin's fate, including murder, kidnapping or a faked disappearance, and are known to have visited Moscow  during the probe, but sources say they have failed to make a major breakthrough.

Rozhetskin was thought to have angered Leonid Reiman, a friend of Putin's and Russia's former telecommunications minister

Rozhetskin  was thought to have angered Leonid Reiman, a friend of Putin's and at the time Russia's powerful telecommunications minister, during a £130million deal involving a mobile phone company in which Reiman was alleged to have had financial interests.

Reiman has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

Rozhetskin - who liked to dine at the Wolseley in Piccadilly and at the fashionable Japanese restaurant Nobu - vanished early on 16 March 2008.

The tycoon, who was secretly gay, had spent the previous evening at his villa in the company of two young men.

They left him at 2.30am, taking a taxi 25 miles to XXL nightclub in Riga. His red Porsche Cayenne, left his villa at 7.30am on 16 March, and was later found abandoned in woods, the rear seats smeared in blood.

FBI agents from the US embassy in Riga were reported to be on the scene soon afterwards assisting Latvian police.

Taxi drivers in Jurmala claimed that on the night of his 'death' Rozhetskin had been whisked by car across the border with Lithuania.

Deepening the mystery, his £9million plane left Latvia soon after his disappearance and in the following days flew on an unexplained odyssey that took in Vienna, Geneva, Norway, Newfoundland and Luton.

At the time of his death, he was known to have possessed at least one illegally-obtained EU passport in another name. The passport had been bought on the black market.

His wife left London in the wake of Rozhetskin's disappearance, initially for the U.S. She was reported to be be too scared with talk.

Since then she has returned to Moscow and is in a new relationship.
