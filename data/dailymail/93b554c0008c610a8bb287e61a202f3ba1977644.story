Chelsea’s title clash at Liverpool could be moved as Jose Mourinho at last finds help at hand from the Premier League fixture planners.

Mourinho has spent much of the year grumbling that the domestic programme handicaps English teams in European competition, while leagues in other countries move games on request to offer clubs more recovery time ahead of Champions League dates.

‘Maybe it does not matter what English clubs do in Europe,’ fumed the Chelsea manager last month.

Good news: The Premier League revealed that they will move one of Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho's fixtures

Pure joy: Mourinho (second right) celebrates with his Chelsea players after they beat PSG on Tuesday

Matchwinner: Demba Ba (centre) scored the decisive goal to send Chelsea through to the semi-finals

The Premier League insist they must be
 fair to all 20 clubs and not help only those involved in Europe but 
they have confirmed Chelsea will not be asked to play on a Sunday before
 a Champions League semi-final game on a Tuesday.

As
 it stands, Mourinho’s team are scheduled to play on a Sunday before 
both legs of the semi-final. They face Sunderland at home on April 20 
and Liverpool away on April 27.

One of the European ties will be on a Tuesday and the other will be on a Wednesday, with the order to be determined on Friday.

Rearranged: Chelsea's game against either Liverpool (left) or Sunderland (right) will be moved

Depending
 on the draw, the Premier League will move either Chelsea’s game against
 Sunderland at Stamford Bridge or the trip to Anfield forward to 
Saturday.

Mourinho will 
learn today the outcome of his improper conduct charge for going on to 
the pitch in the defeat by Aston Villa last month.

Mourinho
 denied the charge and attended a personal hearing yesterday just hours 
after sprinting down the touchline at Stamford Bridge to pass on 
tactical messages to his players after Demba Ba’s goal against Paris 
Saint-Germain.

UEFA will 
await reports from the referee and match delegate before deciding 
whether to take any action against the Chelsea manager but the episode 
at Villa Park has done nothing to curtail his mobility.

Mourinho
 was charged by the FA because he twice stepped on to the pitch after 
Ramires had been sent off in stoppage time. He was sent to the stands by
 referee Chris Foy.

Eden 
Hazard will miss Chelsea’s game at Swansea on Sunday and faces a race to
 be fit for the Champions League semi-final dates after a scan yesterday
 confirmed he has a slight calf strain.

Unfair advantage: Mourinho publicly bemoaned that Galatasaray had longer to prepare for their last-16 clash
