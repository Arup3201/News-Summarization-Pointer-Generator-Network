Phillip Schofield and his employer ITV today agreed to pay Lord McAlpine £125,000 in damages after the television presenter showed a list of alleged paedophiles to David Cameron which contained his name.

Tory peer Lord McAlpine was subjected to lurid online claims falsely linking him to sexual abuse at a north Wales care home which Schofield attempted to bring to the Prime Minister's attention live on This Morning earlier this month.

However, he inadvertently allowed the list of names to be seen by viewers, prompting the latest settlement by Lord McAlpine's legal team who have already taken £185,000 from the BBC over the now infamous Newsnight broadcast which began the witch hunt against him.

McAlpine's lawyer Andrew Reid said the incident has 'embarrassed the Prime Minister and destroyed the reputation of my client'.

In a statement, ITV said today: 'ITV and Phillip Schofield have now reached agreement with Lord McAlpine to settle his libel claim, made in relation to the This Morning programme broadcast on 8 November 2012.

'ITV and Phillip Schofield apologise unreservedly to Lord McAlpine, have agreed the terms of a statement to be made in open court, and have agreed to pay him damages of £125,000 and his legal costs.'

ITV is the second name in a long list of organisations and individuals pursued by Lord McAlpine for wrongly linking him to a paedophile ring.

Action is being considered against a 'very long list' of Twitter users who wrongly named the former Tory politician, thought to include comedian Alan Davies and the Commons Speaker's wife Sally Bercow.

And it emerged yesterday that police are starting a 'scoping process' to look into whether any criminal offence has been committed.

Lord McAlpine has asked those who linked him to child abuse allegations to apologise formally and pay a 'sensible and modest amount', which he plans to donate to BBC Children in Need.

Lord McAlpine was mistakenly implicated by Newsnight's November 2 broadcast in a paedophile ring that targeted children at the care home in Wrexham.

The peer said the damage of the Newsnight report 'can't be repaired' and he now has to live with the legacy of suspicion.

After the broadcast, Newsnight carried a full, on-air apology for the broadcast a week later.An official report by the BBC's Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie into the botched investigation concluded that Newsnight staff had failed to complete 'basic journalistic checks'.

Mr MacQuarrie also found there was confusion about who had responsibility for 'final editorial sign-off', adding that the programme's editorial management structure had been 'seriously weakened' as a result of the editor having to step aside over the Jimmy Savile scandal, and the departure of the deputy editor.

Disciplinary action is being pursued over the incident.

Lord McAlpine has said the BBC could have saved 'a lot of agonising and money' by simply calling him before the programme went out.

His solicitor Andrew Reid told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'We reached a settlement with ITV of £125,000 damages - not an insubstantial amount. My client is pleased with that amount of money.

'It is a pragmatic settlement. I think we accepted the legal argument that the Newsnight programme had effectively set the pot boiling at that point and the Schofield stunt added fuel to the fire that was already there, and we had to take that into account. It was listening to sensible legal argument.'

Mr Reid said he did not know what Lord McAlpine intended to do with the ITV money. The peer has said that he will donate money he receives from people who defamed him on Twitter and other online social media to Children in Need.

The solicitor said he had already been contacted by a number of people who mentioned Lord McAlpine's name on Twitter in the wake of the Newsnight programme - including Sally Bercow, the wife of the Speaker of the House of Commons - and urged others to come forward.

And he revealed that he has spoken to Scotland Yard about the possibility of a police investigation into people who 'maliciously' retweeted the peer's name.
