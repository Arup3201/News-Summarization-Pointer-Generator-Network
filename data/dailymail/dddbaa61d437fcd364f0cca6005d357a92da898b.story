Manchester United’s £16million signing of Marcos Rojo came amid pressure from outside influences for Sporting Lisbon to sell, according to their president Bruno de Carvalho.

Due to third-party ownership laws in the United Kingdom, United had to also buy out Doyen Sports’ stake in the Argentina international defender when they agreed a fee with Sporting.

The 24-year-old eventually made his United debut last month but De Carvalho insists Sporting never wanted Rojo to leave and that the move was instigated by Doyen.

Sporting chairman Bruno de Carvalho says he did not want the Argentine to leave the club

‘We did not want Rojo to leave. He was an important player for us,’ he told the BBC World Football Show.

‘The pressure was so big, they [the third-party owners] started to speak to the clubs and come here to the meetings.

‘The directors thought they were people from the clubs because they were speaking in English although they were Portuguese. They believed it was a person from a club but it was a person from the funds.'

De Carvalho insists that Sporting were under pressure from third-party owners to sell Rojo

Third-party ownership is banned in the UK and last week FIFA agreed to a worldwide ban, though it could take up to four years for that to fully come in to effect.

A KPMG report last year revealed around a quarter of players in the Portuguese top flight had third-party owners.
