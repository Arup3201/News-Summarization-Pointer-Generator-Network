Fall from grace: Derek Smith has been forced to resign from West midlands Police after claiming expenses for a hotel stay with a female colleague

A married police finance chief has quit  his £121,000-a-year job over an expenses claim for an unauthorised hotel stay with a blonde female colleague.

Derek Smith, who advised the Government on charging for police services, faced an investigation into the £200 bill.

But the West Midlands Police civilian director of finance and resources resigned before the inquiry – conducted by another force – was completed.

Mr Smith was also a member of the Association of Chief Police Officers and helped lead West Midlands Police’s £750 million cost-cutting drive, involving hundreds of job losses.

An internal investigation into alleged misconduct by the woman, a civilian police worker who is understood to be married, has also been launched. She is not expected to lose her job.

It is not the first time Mr Smith has been at the centre of controversy. In June last year it was reported that a £40,000 BMW 5 Series car – normally used by undercover officers – was stolen from outside his home, raising questions about why desk-based staff had access to emergency vehicles.

It was kitted out with sirens, police radio and special covert blue lights and was said to be for ‘personal use’. It was unclear how long Mr Smith had been using the car.

He spent 20 years with the West Midlands force and had a range of responsibilities, including managing the human resources department, the police estate – its stations and patrol bases – and its fleet of vehicles.

In his senior management role, which included attending conferences, Mr Smith was authorised to charge legitimate expenses – including hotel stays.

But his fall from grace began after he booked into a Manchester hotel, where he was joined by a female colleague, and charged the stay to the force. The stay was not linked to any police-related event.

The £200 claim is understood to include the accommodation bill, drinks, food and travel expenses.

A West Midlands Police spokesman said its professional standards unit was ‘made aware of an allegation of misconduct against two members of police staff’ in November last year.

He added: ‘The allegation concerns the use of police funds in connection with expenses, travel and accommodation. West Midlands Police expects every employee to act with integrity and honesty.

‘In line with our values, any allegation of misconduct or inappropriate behaviour will be investigated by our Professional Standards Department.

‘One individual has left the force. The second individual concerned  continues to be investigated under  the police staff disciplinary arrangements.’

The spokesman defended the decision to accept Mr Smith’s resignation rather than pursuing costly misconduct proceedings.

‘Regardless of the outcome of  the investigation, it was felt by  the individual concerned, the force and the Police Authority that  this person’s position would be  untenable,’ he said.

Mr Smith had offered to pay  back the money ‘and this will be accepted’.

It is understood there is no suggestion of financial impropriety involving the woman and the allegations are  not serious enough to risk her losing her job.

Mr Smith could not be reached for comment last night.

When contacted by The Mail on  Sunday, his female colleague said: ‘I’m sorry, I can’t comment on that.’
