Amid a slow-growth recession rebound and mounting unemployment concerns, President Obama and his family are tightening their belts, just like the rest of America. With their usual $21 million vacation home on Martha's VIneyard unavailable for the first family's August 10-18 holiday, they have rented a nearby $7.6 million palace instead.

And a nearby hotel, with rooms ranging in price from $225 to $345 per night, has rented more than 75 rooms for Secret Service agents, Transportation Security Agency officers and members of the presidential entourage.

The hotel rooms alone will cost between $135,000 and $207,000. It's unknown how much the home rental for the president's family and their closest friends will set the Obamas back. The WHite House has said in the past that the president and Mrs. Obama pay for their own food and lodging during vacations, as has been the practice in previous administrations.

Sundberg Kennedy Ly-Au Young Architects built the home in 2006. First class all the way, but it's a step down from the $21 million home the Obama's are accustomed to renting for their New England vacations

The most expensive published rental rates on the island run between $30,000 and $35,000 per week. A property expert in the town of Vineyard Haven told MailOnline that the Obamas' chosen property, owned by financier David Schulte, would 'likely run in the $40,000 to $60,000 range for the eight-day stay.'

'I wish I had the commission on that,' said the rental agent, who asked not to be identified.

The $21 million home the Obamas rented for their 2011 vacation on Martha's Vineyard cost an estimated $50,000 per week.

Their personal costs, though, will pale in comparison to the taxpayers' portion of the expenses. Secret Service protection, location pre-screening, White House staff pay, operation of Air Force One, the hotel accommodations for government employees and many other budget items will likely top $2 million.

Sunscreen? Check. Beach umbrella? Check. Entourage and Secret Service protection? If this 2009 trip to 'The Vineyard' is any indication, the trip will cost $2 million or more

The home 'sits on nine and a half acres' and includes 'a low group of buildings connected by porches, terraces, and patios,' according to the architects

If past vacations are any guide, those expenditures will also include Coast Guard ships off the Massachusetts coast, a motorcade of more than 20 cars, specialized 'war wagon' SUVs flown on military aircraft for the Obamas' use, 

Air Force One alone costs the government $180,000 per hour to operate and staff. The Obamas are only required to reimburse the Treasury for the cost of a comparable commercial fare. News organizations follow the same guidelines when sending reporters on the specially outfitted aircraft.

In a 2011 interview with US News & World Report, former White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry defended the costs related to a massive presidential vacation delegation.

'Remember [President] Clinton's trip to Martha's Vineyard in August 1998 when we ended up trying to decapitate bin Laden with a cruise missile strike?' McCurry recalled. 'That's why the "entourage" has to accommodate all aspects of the presidency, even on vacation. You never know what might happen. August always produces the unexpected.'

White House Dossier, written by former White House correspondent Keith Koffler, estimated in January that the Obamas' vacations in Hawaii since 2009 have cost a collective $20 million.

The Vineyard Times, a newspaper on Martha's Vineyard, first reported on July 17 that the Obamas had settled on Schulte's property for their holiday.

Sundberg Kennedy Ly-Au Architects, which designed the home in 2006, writes that it 'sits on nine and a half acres' and includes 'a low group of buildings connected by porches, terraces, and patios.'

'The choice of materials reflect both a modern sensibility and the architectural traditions of the Northeast in general and the island in particular, with gray-toned wood shingles, metal, stone, and concrete in evidence.

'A huge glacial erratic, or boulder dropped by an ancient retreating glacier, was left in place,' the architects write, 'and now rests near the front entrance—a marker to guide visitors into the welcoming compound and further ground the home in its natural surroundings.'
