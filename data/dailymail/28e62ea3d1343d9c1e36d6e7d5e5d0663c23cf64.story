A bottle shop employee in Burswood, Auckland was attacked by four men after he tried to stop one of them stealing three six packs of Coronas on Saturday

One man started punching the employee in the stomach and head before another man joined in

When he tries to walk out of the front door with them, a lone employee tries to check his ID, at which point the men start attacking him.

One man punches him in the stomach and head before another man joins in and starts kicking and punching him.

The fight progresses to the back wall of the store where the men kick him repeatedly in the chest and face.

At one point the employee is hit so hard over the head with a bottle of spirits that it smashes.

In the video, one man is seen grabbing bottles of liquor and running out of the store smiling while his friends stay to continue their horrific attack.

Police said the employee was concussed during the attack and was hospitalised overnight

The other men then grab more bottles of liquor and six packs of beer before running out of the store.

Counties Manukau Police spokeswoman Katherine Manaton said the employee was concussed during the attack and was hospitalised overnight.

He has spent the past four days recovering with his family.

'He's bruised and battered but fine,' Ms Manaton told Daily Mail Australia.

She added that police were confident they would identify the attackers due to the clarity of the footage, which was sent to the New Zealand Herald.
