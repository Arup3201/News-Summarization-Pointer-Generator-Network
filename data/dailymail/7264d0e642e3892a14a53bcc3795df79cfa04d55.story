It is a joyride gone wrong, with a somewhat old-fashioned twist.

Four Amish teens have been arrested and charged with illegal possession of alcohol after one of their buggies collided with a police car.

The police were responding to a report of teens holding an underage drinking party in their buggies while parked on deserted country roads.

As a patrol car arrived on the scene, one of the Amish buggies changed lanes and collided with the police vehicle.

Rural: The town of Sherman is near the Pennsylvania border

The Chautauqua County Sheriff's Office said the crash occurred around 7:15 Sunday in the rural town of Sherman, near the Pennsylvania border in New York's southwest corner.

As a patrol car arrived at Clymer Hill Road, the Post-Journal reported that one of the Amish buggies suddenly changed lanes, colliding with the police vehicle.

The impact caused the buggy to flip onto its side, causing minor injuries to Marvin Byler, 19, one of the people riding in it.

He was arrested, along with Marty Troyer, 20, Marianne Troyer, 18, and Leroy Troyer, 20.

Marianne was also riding in the buggy that flipped, but was unhurt, Newscore reported.

Leroy was driving a second wagon and stopped it after the accident.Police say several other buggies fled the scene.

According to Buffalo News, Marty was also charged with unlawfully dealing with a child, as he appeared to be the host of the rural get-together.

Police said they recovered several containers of alcohol from the two carriages.

Driving a buggy has proved perilous for many Amish whether or not alcohol has played a factor, as they face off against large SUVs, trucks, and inattentive drivers.

Last July, an Amish teen in Wango, New York led police on a slow-speed chase when they spotted him driving with an open beer container.

In 2009, a man was arrested in Paradise, Pennsylvania, for getting behind the reins after a few too many.

He was found slumped over and asleep in his buggy with a blood-alcohol level of .18 per cent.
