A U.S. Air Force veteran
has been charged with attempting to travel to Syria to join ISIS after watching their online propaganda videos, the Department of Justice announced today.

Tairod Nathan
Webster Pugh, 47, was indicted by a grand jury in Brooklyn on Monday for allegedly attempting to provide material support to the group and attempting to obstruct justice.

Pugh is an American citizen who previously served as an avionics instrument system specialist in the Air Force. His most recent address according to property records was in Bridgeton, New Jersey. 

Authorities say he tried to join ISIS earlier this year, weeks after being fired from his job as an airplane mechanic in Kuwait.

On January 10, he allegedly flew from Egypt to Turkey with the intention of crossing the Syrian border to 'fight violent jihad' with ISIS - but Turkish authorities denied him entry and sent him on a flight back to Egypt.

Once there, he was found to be carrying suspicious items, including a cell phone photograph of a machine gun  and multiple electronic items, and was deported to the U.S. in January 15.

FBI agents allegedly found he had been using his laptop to watch ISIS propaganda videos online and to search for such phrases including 'borders controlled by Islamic state'.

They also found a chart on the computer showing crossing points between Turkey and Syria indicating areas on the Syrian side of the border controlled by ISIS.

There were also online searches for 'Flames of War', a 55-minute propaganda video, and other footage, including one of ISIS members executing prisoners.

Agents also searched two backpacks he used overseas and found they contained compasses, a solar-powered flashlight, a solar-powered power source, a fatigue jacket and camping clothes.

Pugh, who told authorities he has a wife in Egypt, was arrested in Asbury Park, New Jersey on January 16 and has been in custody since. The case has been sealed during that time.

Pugh is set to be arraigned before a federal judge tomorrow morning in the Eastern
District of New York, where his attorney said he plans to plead not guilty, CNN reported.

If convicted of the charges, he faces a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison. 

Pugh served in the Air Force between 1986 to 1990 and, while there, received training in the installation and maintenance of aircraft engine, navigation, and weapons systems.

When he left, he worked for a number of companies in the U.S. and Middle East as an avionics specialist and airplane mechanic. He had been living the Middle East for at least 18 months.

His LinkedIn profile shows he last worked as a maintenance manager for the U.S. carrier Gryphon Airlines. 

Outrage: U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, pictured in January, said Pugh 'turned his back on his country'

A Facebook page that appears to belong to him contains multiple anti-Israel photos, calling it 'terrorist country', and anti-Semitic images. In August 2014, he also shared quotes from famous Al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki on the page.

His social networking pages also suggests he has two children with a former partner and he was pictured visiting them last year. Still, he wrote on the page that he never wanted to return to the U.S.

'Born and raised in the United States, Pugh allegedly turned his back on his country and attempted to travel to Syria in order to join a terrorist organization,' U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement.

'We will continue to vigorously prosecute extremists, whether based here or abroad, to stop them before they are able to threaten the United States and its allies.' 

Assistant Director in Charge Diego G. Rodriguez of the FBI's New York Field Office added: 'U.S. citizens who offer support to terrorist organizations pose a grave threat to our national security and will face serious consequences for their actions.'
