A mother who made the heartbreaking decision to have her daughter’s legs amputated has spoken of her joy that she is now dancing, running and even cycling on her own.

Born without tibia bones in her lower leg, Evie Taylor would have faced severe difficulties walking.

But after her mother allowed doctors to amputate her daughter's legs when she was a year old, with prosthetics, Evie can now move around like any other child.

Evie Taylor was born missing her tibia bones in her lower leg. Her mother was forced to make the agonising decision to have her daughter's lower limbs totally amputated in order for her to walk easily in the future

Evie was born with Werner Mesomelic Dysplasia, a condition that meant her tibia bones - the second largest bone in the leg - did not form. Doctors warned that she may not be able to walk properly without surgery

Evie has now learnt to dance, run, cycle and even bounce on a trampoline, without any help.

Ms Taylor, from Dudley, West Midlands, said: ‘It’s incredible to see how far Evie has come.

‘Signing the form that gave the surgeons permission to amputate was one of the hardest decisions I ever made - but I now know it was the right thing.

‘To see Evie running around and playing with her older sister, Freya, is just amazing.’

Evie was born with Werner Mesomelic Dysplasia, a condition that meant her tibia bones - the second largest bone in the leg - did not form.

Doctors warned that as the she grew, Evie
 would have severe difficulties with walking and mobility, leaving Ms 
Taylor with two options.

‘I
 had spoken to doctors abroad who said it would be possible to use 
Evie’s toes to try and grow new tibia bones, and we could also try leg 
lengthening procedures,' Ms Taylor said.

‘This method was going to be a very long and painful process - and may not actually work.

‘The other option was to amputate, and ultimately, I felt this option was the only one I could choose.’

After talking to charities such as Steps, Ms Taylor came to conclusion that if Evie did not have an operation or an amputation, she would never be able to walk.

Evie 
underwent surgery in November 2011, when she was one. Ms Taylor said: 
‘The time leading up to the surgery was very difficult.

‘You are asked to sign a form to confirm that you want them to do the operation, and it was horrible.

‘Evie was so little, just a baby, it was hard to think about what she was going to be put through.

‘I
 wondered if she would hate me one day for doing this to her, but I just
 had to remember that it was going to change her life for the better.

‘When she came round from the operation, I was so relieved she was okay - it was odd to see her without her legs.

‘But when they took the casts off I was pleased, the stitching was tidy and it looked very neat. I was actually really pleased.’

Within a week, Evie began to walk on her new stumps.

‘Obviously I’d been concerned with how she would adapt, but she was amazing,’ Ms Taylor said.

‘She’s
 a feisty little thing and I think she shocked everyone with her 
progress. She wasn’t fazed by any of it; she just got on with it.’

Evie was fitted with prosthetic limbs the following February and grasped using them straight away.

Evie has also now learnt to dance, run, cycle 
and even play on a bouncy castle (left), without any help. Her bike 
(right) was specially built for her after a fundraising campaign, 
because she could not use a traditional bike

‘Now that Evie is growing up, she knows that she’s different to other people, but she takes it in her stride,’ Ms Taylor said.

‘Sometimes she will ask me if she can grow some legs and toes, but I explain to her gently that it’s not possible.

‘She goes dancing, swimming, she jumps on the trampoline in our garden and she runs around with her big sister.

‘She was walking unaided by the time she was two, she’s very determined.’

Thanks to the support from her local community, Evie now even has a specially made bike that she can cycle around on.

Ms Taylor explained: ‘Evie and Freya were playing in the garden and Freya was on a bike

‘I
 put Evie on hers and she couldn’t use it as her prosthetics don’t allow
 her legs to bend. It was really sad to watch her as she so desperately 
wanted to be able to use it.

‘So I started fundraising for a specially adapted bike that you pedal with your hands.

‘When we finally got it she was so excited, and now she even uses it to cycle to school.’

‘I’m just so proud of her, she’s gone through so much, and there’s no stopping her.’
