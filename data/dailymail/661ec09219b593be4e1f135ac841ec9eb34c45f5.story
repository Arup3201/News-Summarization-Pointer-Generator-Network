Former Rolling Stone Bill Wyman and Sir Michael Parkinson were among a host of stars who turned out to say goodbye to film director Michael Winner today.

Winner, who made more than 30 films 
including the blockbuster Death Wish series, died at home in Kensington,
London, on Monday following a lengthy battle with liver disease.

His funeral was conducted by Rabbi Geoffrey Shisler at Willesden Jewish Cemetery, North London, before a reception at Winner's Kensington home.

Sir David Frost and Sir Michael Parkinson, pictured right with his wife Mary, were among the mourners at the funeral of Michael Winner at Willesden Cemetery in North London on Wednesday

A range of famous faces who knew Winner from his 50 years in the film business joined widow Geraldine at the 'moving' service.

Among the mourners were Sir David Frost, photographer Terry O'Neill, lyricist Don Black, singer Chris Rea, Henry Wyndham, chairman of Sotheby's, and Winner's long-term assistant Dinah May.

A statement issued by his office said: 'If Michael had been alive to film it, he would have said, "Perfect, darling, perfect".

'A cold wind whipped a flurry of snowflakes across the cemetery - a film directors’ dream.'

Winner’s personal assistant, Natalie Wright, said: 'It was the most moving occasion. I’ve worked for Michael for the last five years and he would have loved the send-off.'

Ms Wright added that there were plans for a public memorial service later in the year.

Winner worked with some of the biggest stars in Hollywood, including Marlon Brando, Robert Mitchum and Faye Dunaway, during his film making career.

He later reinvented himself as a restaurant critic, writing about food in his typically flamboyant style in his Winner’s Dinners column for the Sunday Times.

Winner, whose appearance in adverts for motor insurance coined the catchphrase 'Calm down, dear, it’s a commercial', also founded and funded the Police Memorial Trust following the murder of WPc Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London in 1984.

More than 50 officers have been honoured by the trust at sites across the country.

His initiative led to a National Police Memorial being erected in the Mall in central London.

Winner, pictured filming on the set of Scorpio in 1972, made more than 30 movies during his career

In later life, Winner's ad-libbed remark 'Calm down dear, it's a commercial' became the catchphrase for the Esure motor insurance adverts
