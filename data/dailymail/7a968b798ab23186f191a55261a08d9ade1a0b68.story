In a vast warehouse on the banks of the River Clyde, the Commonwealth Games hosted its most high profile event yet — the unveiling of Usain Bolt, the superstar billed as the saviour of the Games amid a slew of high profile drop-outs.

The fastest man in the world will not compete until Friday evening and even then, only in the heats of the 4x100 metres relay, but his presence alone is a boost for the Games.

In the absence of Mo Farah, who withdrew on Thursday — too late for his face to be removed from the promotional material which adorns Glasgow — Bolt is by far the biggest draw, arguably the only athlete here who  transcends the sport.

His opening address at the dimly lit Loch Lomond press conference room was as  enthusiastically attended as some of the  sessions of sport here. Bolt said all the right things, starting with confirmation he would run after weeks of doubt that he would be in shape after suffering a foot injury.

Incredulous: Bolt did not like it when a reporter questioned whether he would really run in Glasgow

‘I have done a lot of training over this past month,’ he said, ‘I have been really pushing myself and I am in pretty good shape, but I am not yet in running shape, hence why I am  running the heats, just to get a few runs in.’

The athletics programme, which gets under way On Sunday, needs the star quality he brings.

Bolt made his entrance with Clyde, the Games mascot, and high-fived several  local schoolchildren. Someone tried to present him with a kilt — ‘red is not my colour,’ —  then some haggis and there were several requests for ‘selfies’. And that’s just from reporters.

The only occasion Bolt looked troubled in this session was when asked his opinion on the Gaza conflict. He hadn’t had a chance to  ‘follow it up,’ he said, slightly flustered.

Bolt, who has eight world titles and six Olympic gold medals, has never competed in a Commonwealth Games and will miss the  individual sprints again.

But he denied it had lost its lustre as an event with the absence of Farah, suffering from an unspecified illness, and other big stars.

‘I don’t think anybody pulled out on purpose,’ he said. ‘It’s about injuries. It happens in the Olympics and World Championships, things just go wrong at the last moment. It’s just one of those things. There are lot more athletes here and I am sure it’ll be a good Games. I am looking forward to watching to see what the level is.’

Bolt and Farah share a major sponsor with the Glasgow 2014 organisers, and there have been suggestions he was under pressure to compete for commercial reasons.

‘I never try to say it’s pressure,’ he said, ‘I told my coach I wanted to come and he said "right we will make a decision, it depends on how the season is going", and I got injured and at the end we said we couldn’t make it for the trials but let’s make it for the 4x100m.’

Bolt moved into the athletes’ village yesterday evening and said he would spend most of his time in his room to avoid requests for photographs and autographs from other  competitors. He will hope to have more  luck with his housemates than Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford, who compared his accommodation to a noisy student flat.

‘It’s like a halls of residence,’ said Rutherford. ‘But when you are in professional sport you hope that people respect the fact that you are not about to go out on the lash all day.

‘I was actually awake when the noisy b******s started this morning but I have heard it is a couple of coaches, my investigations haven’t quite gone as far as getting names but things are going to get sorted out.’

The first track and field medals will be won on Sunday evening in the men’s and women’s marathon and the men’s 5,000m. England’s Adam Gemili will run in the 100m heats and has set his sights both on winning a medal and posting his first sub-10sec time.

‘I feel I have been fit enough to do it for a while, weather-permitting, and it would be awesome to do it in front of a British crowd,’ said Gemili. ‘That would be unbelievable.’ He wished Bolt and his compatriot Yohan Blake, the second fastest man in the world, were competing in the 100m, even though it gives him more chance of a podium finish.

‘If you want to challenge yourself, why not challenge yourself against the quickest man in the world,’ added Gemili.

‘It is lucky I got to race him in Moscow (at the World Championships) and it is always  a shame when he is not at his full fitness to race here.’
