Conrad De Souza has been ordered to pay back £270,000 of the money he earned while pretending to be a qualified doctor for Lewisham 
Primary Care Trust (PCT) between 2001 and 2010.

He was jailed for 27 months in October last year. De Souza, 54, of Whitmore Road, in Beckenham, received more than £329,000 from the NHS in fraudulently obtained earnings, Croydon Crown Court heard on December 5.

At the PCT, he was employed in highly-paid strategic roles for which it was essential to have a degree and clinical specialisms — however, he had neither.

NHS Protect anti-fraud specialist David Horsley said: 'As a result of his deception, Mr De Souza has not only served a substantial prison sentence for his crimes but has also been ordered to pay £270,000.

'The confiscation order of £270,000 should serve as a warning to anyone tempted to defraud the NHS that, wherever appropriate, NHS Protect will not only seek criminal, civil and disciplinary sanctions but will press for the recovery of any lost NHS funds.'

De Souza's deception was discovered when he was caught faking a DNA sample to avoid maintenance costs for a child he had with a one-time lover.

He pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation at Croydon Crown Court.

At the trial, prosecutor Robert O’Sullivan said De Souza had lied about having three years’ experience at a busy practice in Beckenham.

The court heard his CV 'could be 
described as a work of fiction' and that he had used details of another 
doctor with a similar name to get the jobs.

The
Tanzanian-born British citizen had enrolled at the University of London
medical school in 1980 but never graduated. Sangita Modgil, mitigating,
said De Souza had come from a successful family and could not cope with
having failed university.

She said describing himself as a doctor was something of huge importance to his self-esteem.

At the time a spokesman from NHS Lewisham said De Souza had never treated patients, examined them or prescribed medication to them while in his roles as clinical advisor at NHS Lewisham and as assistant clinical director for the South East London Cardiac and Stroke Network.

Judge Simon Pratt described his behaviour as 'brazen' and said he had been 'deeply dishonest and wilfully manipulative.'

He said: 'You were an articulate, driven and deeply dishonest man without any apparent conscience about what you were doing.'

In a separate case heard at Bromley Magistrates’ Court, De Souza had pleaded guilty to a charge of fraud by false representation after falsifying a DNA sample.

He was asked to supply the sample after medical researcher Silke Luetzelschwab became pregnant following an affair.

De Souza refused to acknowledge fathering the child and Miss Luetzelschwab was forced to contact the Child Support Agency.

The court heard he supplied the DNA of a close male relative, most likely his father’s.

De Souza was later proved to be the father of Miss Luetzelschwab’s daughter, who was born in December 2009, after which the investigation began. It was also revealed that he was in fact married.

Speaking after sentencing, Stuart Richards, the principle legal enforcement manager for the Child Support Agency in the south east, said De Souza had been 'living a lie'.

He said: 'This was perhaps the most sophisticated attempt to cheat a mother and child out of financial support that the CSA has ever seen.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
