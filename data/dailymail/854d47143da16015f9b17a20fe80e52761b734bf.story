A driver pulled over when he saw title of Adele's song 'Fire' flash up on his dashboard and panicked 

A worried driver pulled onto the hard shoulder of a motorway after seeing the word 'fire' flash up on a dashboard display - only to discover it was the title of the song playing on his car stereo.

The mix-up, caused by the title of the hit song by Adele, is one of number of incidents highlighted in a safety campaign to stop people needlessly causing a hazard on Britain's roads.

The Highways Agency, which is in charge of the UK's motorways, has revealed some of the most bizarre excuses for pulling over in a bid to remind people that it is illegal to stop on the hard shoulder unless in an emergency.

On one occasion, traffic officers found two cars on the hard shoulder, with one driver halfway through his vehicle to the other.

On another occasion, a couple were asked if they had broken down but replied that they were taking pictures of their newborn grandchild in their open-top sports car because it was 'a lovely day'.

Other instances have included:

:: A motorist who parked up and fell asleep on the M6.

:: A group of motorcyclists who parked on the hard shoulder on the M1 to review their route and have a drink.

:: A mobile phone user who stopped at regular intervals to carry out signal tests on the hard shoulder.

The agency said that between July and September 2013, a total of 2,062 drivers broke the law by stopping on the hard shoulder when there was no emergency..

It is also illegal to drive under a red X sign which is displayed when the lane ahead is closed.

Highways Agency national enforcement co-ordinator Jamie Hassall said: 'Every day, millions of people use our motorways.

'Most of them use the hard shoulder correctly and don't ignore red Xs, but we are appealing to the few who put themselves, other road users and those working on motorways at risk.

'Where the hard shoulder is used as an additional traffic lane at peak times, you can only drive on it if there is a speed limit over it. When a red X is displayed over any lane, it's simple - don't drive on it.'
