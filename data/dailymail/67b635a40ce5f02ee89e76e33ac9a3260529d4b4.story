Two teenage boys were charged last night with the rape of a 12-year-old girl, Scotland Yard said.

The 17-year-olds, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were due to appear at Thames Magistrates' Court in Bow, east London, today.

The girl was targeted by three young men who had started talking to her.

They are said to have taken her to a garage area in Hibbert Road, Walthamstow, east London, at around 12.15am on Saturday.

She was allegedly pinned down and raped by two of them, before calling a friend who came to help.

Detective Inspector Simon Ellershaw described the incident as a 'very nasty attack'.

He said: 'This was a very nasty attack on a vulnerable girl just 12 years old by a group of older males who engaged her in conversation before leading her to a secluded area.

First court appearance: One of the teenagers was remanded in custody while the other was released on bail at Thames Magistrates' Court (pictured) yesterday

'She was pinned down and two of the males then brutally raped her.'

The two suspects were arrested yesterday.
