For one night only: Esther Rantzen is bringing That's Life! back to TV screens as she launches her helpline for older people

The show announced the creation of Esther Rantzen’s Childline three decades ago.

And now the presenter is bringing That’s Life! back to TV screens for one night only  – as she launches her helpline for older people.

Miss Rantzen will appear on tonight’s edition of BBC’s The One Show, teaming up with hosts Matt Baker and Alex Jones to front an updated version of the long-running magazine programme.

That’s Life! ran on BBC One for more than 20 years and was famous for campaigning on serious issues, as well as running light-hearted sections featuring funny poems, performing pets and strangely shaped vegetables.

Miss Rantzen is using tonight’s show to launch her latest charity – the Silver Line helpline for older people – 27 years after she launched the children’s service Childline on That’s Life!

The dedicated phone number, which allows children to speak to trained advisors for free and in confidence, received thousands of calls in its first year and continued to expand until it became part of the NSPCC in 2006.

Several former That’s Life! presenters will be in the audience tonight including Howard Leader and Bill Buckley.

The Silver Line was created by Miss Rantzen with the aim of linking lonely older people to services in their area.

It will provide a ‘befriending service’ and will also help those who may be suffering from abuse or neglect.

Kate Jopling, director for the Campaign to End Loneliness, said: ‘Loneliness is a shockingly common problem, but admitting we are lonely can be incredibly hard to do because of the stigma that surrounds it.

‘When people find the courage to ask for
help, it is vital that someone is there to listen – which is why a 
24-hour phone line, where people are always on hand to take your call, 
is such an important addition to the safety net available to older 
people.’

She added: ‘We hope that Esther Rantzen’s new project the Silver Line will provide a really prominent new gateway to this support.’ 

David McCullough, chief executive of the Royal Voluntary Service, which is supporting the campaign, said: ‘It is essential that older people have easy access to information and services that can help improve their lives – whether that is a simple measure like having a “befriender” come and visit every week or help facing larger issues such as moving into a care home or losing a partner.’

He added: ‘Older people who call the Silver Line will be put in touch with vital local services, such as those provided by the Royal Voluntary Service which provide companionship and support, helping older people to live life rather than simply exist.’

Miss Rantzen wrote in 2011 about the loneliness she suffered after the death of her husband. 

Last year she revealed in the Mail that she would be setting up the Silver Line to help other people experiencing the same problem.

‘Loneliness particularly strikes older people who are used to having a purpose in life, to being needed,’ she said.

‘Gradually, the community they used to belong to has shrunk away to nothing… After a busy family life, and perhaps an active career, being alone has come as a painful shock.’

She added: ‘So, I hope and believe that the Silver Line could become a lifeline to all those older people who have contributed so much throughout their lives but now feel so isolated and alone.’

The Silver Line phone number is 0800 4 70 80 90.
