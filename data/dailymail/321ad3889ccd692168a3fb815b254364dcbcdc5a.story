When Mary Geiss called last orders at Ye Olde Tea Shoppe, she had one fairly pressing problem - what to do with all ye olde teapots.

Because as well as the ones she actually used to make tea, Mrs Geiss had also collected a few extras, just for decoration purposes.

About 1,000 extras in fact - in every conceivable shape and size.

During her 14 years in business in Midhurst, West Sussex, she amassed teapots in all shapes and sizes which jockeyed for position on shelves and mantel pieces.

Now she is hoping that someone will take on the collection rather than having to box them up and put them in storage.

'When my partner Clive and I moved here there was one white papier mache teapot on display in the window and it looked awful,' she said.

'I tried putting plants there but that didn't look right either, so I started collecting teapots from charity shops and car boot sales and anywhere else I saw them. I have got teapots like ducks, fish, chickens, cats, mice, pigs and a horse.

'None of them are particularly valuable - although there is an original 17th century Chinese one which is worth about £200. I do have some favourites - like a leopard print one and a fishing basket one and one that looks like the Orient Express train.

I never used them to serve tea, they were just ornaments.'

Mrs Geiss is moving out of the old fashioned shop, which has a 16th century wall painting, because she says trade has been hit by a combination of factors including the recession, competition from trendy new coffee shops and the fact that the Highways Agency has taken Midhurst off the map by failing to signpost it from the main A3 road from London.

for every interest or taste

'When we first came here there were five or six coaches and all their passengers every week and even some through the winter when shopping tours stopped here. Now we are lucky if we get one a week.

'There used to be just four shops like ours in the town but now there are lots more and it is inevitable we can't all survive.

'We kept thinking business would pick up but it reached the stage where we just couldn't carry on. We worked out we had to make £450 a day to break even and at times we have been down to the £200 to £300s.'
