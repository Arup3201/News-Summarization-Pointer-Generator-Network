In the social media war-of-words between Anthony Weiner and Andrew Cuomo, the governor was the clear victor.

Disgraced former congressman Weiner put his foot in his mouth - again - on Friday, with a tweet that poked fun at Cuomo's dramatic decision last month to close the New York subways to prepare for one of the worst blizzards in the city's history - which never transpired.

'Sunday’s gonna be cold. Governor Cuomo will soon be closing the subway,' Weiner posted.

However Cuomo's staffers were quick to fire back, with spokesman Rich Azzopardi replying: 'Yes, it is going to be cold. A good reason to keep your pants on.'

Ouch: Gov. Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi was quick to respond with this zinger

Weiner, a New York Democrat, was caught engaging in sexual dalliances with young women who were not his wife on two separate occasions.

However he refused to let the online burn slide.

According to The New York Post, he wrote back using a referencing the corruption case against State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who is accused of amassing millions of dollars in bribes.

'I have to be careful ­responding. I don’t want to be accused of witness tampering,' Weiner replied.

Weiner resigned from his congressional seat in 2011 after a conservative news organization revealed that he had sent an explicit picture to a 21-year-old college student over his Twitter account.

The married Congressman initially denied sending the lewd photo and suggested that he was the victim of a hack.

But after the news organization, led by late conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart, accused Weiner of sending a second photo of himself to another woman, Weiner confessed to carrying on with half a dozen women online over a three-year period both before and after his marriage to Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton.

Less than two years after exiting Congress, Weiner attempted reenter politics by running for New York mayor.

Early on in the Democratic primary the former congressman appeared to be on the verge of a political comeback. 

Three months later he found himself at the center of new sexting allegations, however. 

This time he was accused of having an secret relationship with a 22-year-woman named Sydney Leathers.

Weiner acknowledged that he conversed with Leathers under the screen name Carols Danger from late 2012 right up to the time he announced his mayoral bid and to having sexual relationships online with up to 10 women but refused to drop out of the race. 

He quickly dropped to the back of the race, receiving just 4.5 percent of the vote when all was said and done.
