British judo fighter Karina Bryant earned Team GB's 19th medal of London 2012 this afternoon after winning bronze in the women's 78kg contest.

Bryant, 33, saw off the challenge of Ukranian Iryna Kindzerska to secure third place, earning Great Britain their seventh bronze in another successful day for the home nation.

The medal is a personal triumph for Britain's most successful judo fighter Bryant, who had resorted to asking strangers for cash earlier this year, amid fears a lack of it will derail her Olympic dream.

Despite being a four-time European champion, the Olympic medal is Bryant's first podium appearance at the Games, having reached the round of 16 in 2000 and 2008 and the quarter-finals in 2004.

She won her hard-earned bronze medal less than a day after Gemma Gibbons' emotional silver medal judo performance yesterday.

Bryant's bronze came after she secured third place at the European Championships in Russia back in April.

Her chances of a medal looked slim early on in the contest against Ukranian Kindzerska, as she went behind to a waza-ari in the first minute of the contest.

But Bryant showed fighting character to level the fight with a waza-ari of her own, before winning the contest minutes later in front of fervent home support at the ExCel Arena.

Bryant revealed in May she had launched an appeal to strangers for cash so she could afford a small car to get her to training.

The Aldershot judo star said she needed Â£5,000 for a 'modest runaround' to get her from her Aldershot home to her training base in Camberley, 10 miles away.

She said earlier this year: 'I had so many problems with my car. At one point I was having to crawl through the boot to get in.

'I need something I can rely on to get me through the next few months and the Games because it is stressful worrying about whether I can get to places.'
