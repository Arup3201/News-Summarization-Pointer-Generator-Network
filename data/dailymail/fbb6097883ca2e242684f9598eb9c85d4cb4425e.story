Most people would probably pay money to keep a pair of old shoes that at one point may have been covered in flu germs as far from them as possible.

But if the shoes once belonged to Michael Jordan - and were worn during one of his more legendary games - people are willing to cough up quite a bit of cash to get their hands on a piece of sports history.

So is the caseÂ  with the shoes Jordan wore during his famous 'Flu Game,' which sold at auction Thursday morning for a record-shattering $104,765.

Tough: Despite feeling ill, Jordan scored 38 points in the Bulls' Game 5 victory over the Utah Jazz

The pricey kicks were worn by Jordan during Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals when the Chicago Bulls took on the Utah Jazz.

Despite displaying flu-like symptoms before, throughout and after the game, number 23 scored 38 points in the game. The media later dubbed Jordan's performance as the 'Flu Game.'

The shoes were later secured by the Jazz's longtime ball-boy Preston Truman, ESPN.com reports, after Truman and Jordan developed a relationship that began when Truman brought Jordan his traditional pre-game applesauce during the 1996-97 season.

Truman brought the shoes to auction, where an unknown collector made the record-setting purchase.

The previous record auction price for a pair of shoes happened last month, when a collector paid $31,070 for another pair of Jordan's shoes. That pair was worn during his rookie season with the Bulls.

Before the 'Flue Game,' Truman brought Jordan his traditional applesauce. When the game was over, and Jordan's performance had helped give the Bulls a 3-2 lead over the Jazz, Jordan gave Truman the shoes.

In addition to the shoes, Truman got a photo of Jordan signing the shoes for him the night of the game, which helped authenticate the shoes as actually being the ones that Jordan wore.

'I think my photo that Jordan's bodyguard took with me standing there 
drove up the price because buyers didn't have to worry if they were 
real,' Truman told ESPN.com.

Bidding for the shoes started at $5,000 last month. It took only 15 bids to get the price over the $100,000 mark.

The identity of the winning bidder currently is unknown.
