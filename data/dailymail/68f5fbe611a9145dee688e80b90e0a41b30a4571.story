Suspicious: Mantas Leonavicius's death in Stanley Street in North Shields is being treated as a murder

Mr Leonavicius is fairly well known in the local area, and is thought to have visited local off licences and pizza take away shops regularly.

Residents told police he would often sit on the steps of his Stanley Street flat in a combat-style jacket.

Northumbria Police are appealing for anyone who saw Mr Leonavicius, who had a 'distinctive ginger goatee style beard', between Wednesday and Friday to come forward.

North Tyneside Chief Superintendent Steve Neill said: "Enquiries into Mr Leonavicius' murder are ongoing and the three people arrested remain in police custody.

'Mr Leonavicius was fairly well known in the area - he had a distinctive ginger goatee style beard - and a number of people we have spoken to have mentioned that they regularly used to see him sat on the steps outside his flat.

'We really need to hear from anyone who has seen him between Wednesday and Friday to ring us on 101 and pass this information on - no matter how insignificant they might think it is, it could still help us with our enquiries.'

Detectives arrested a fourth man tonight in connection with the murder.The 21-year-old is currently in custody, Northumbria Police said.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
