Michelle Obama showed off her 
enviably toned thighs as she powered past the President in tiny purple 
cycling shorts on the first family's bike ride on Martha's Vineyard 
today.

Wearing a fashionable printed T-shirt
 and Converse trainers, the First Lady showed that she still has style, 
even when on vacation.

But her husband looked goofy and 
tired as he lagged behind wearing a baggy black polo shirt, and perhaps 
more surprisingly jeans.

Ahead of the pack: First Lady Michelle Obama was wearing a tight pair of purple cycling shorts

Ready for action: Mrs Obama looked more prepared for the ride than her tired looking husband

In the Massachussetts sunshine, the Commander-in-Chief looked uncomfortable in the heavy denim trousers.

Mr Obama had rolled up the bottom of 
the jeans, in perhaps an attempt to avoid them getting stuck in the 
bicycle chain, or maybe because he was feeling the heat.

The President seemed to have his clothing hoping for a more lesiurely paced cycle than his wife.

The ride came as Mr Obama's approval rating reached a record low of minus 26.

The poll for Tuesday showed that 19 per cent of the nation's voters strongly approve of his performance, compared to 45 per cent who strongly disapprove.

This previous low was minus 24, which was reached yesterday and also in September 2010.

Super-fit Mrs Obama revealed her smooth thighs on the ride this morning, showing the results of her gruelling exercise regime.

She wore a white T-shirt with a print of a trompe l'oeil necklace.

Mr Obama ignored a reporter's shouted
 question on the whereabouts of Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi as he 
cycled through Manuel F Correllus State Forest.

Aides said Mr Obama got national security and economic briefings before 
setting out under bright, sunny skies to hit the bike trail for a quick 
spin.

Safety first: Mr Obama was wearing a cycle helmet, unlike on his vacation two years ago

Vacation: First Lady Michelle Obama and her daughter Sasha ride bikes during their family vacation to Martha's Vineyard

Cycle: Barack Obama rides alongside his daughter Malia during their family vacation

Vacation: The President wore a black polo shirt and matching black helmet

The President arrived last Thursday for a 10-day break from Washington 
that has been interrupted by developments in Libya. He is scheduled to 
return to the White House on Saturday.

The 5,100-acre forest has become a 
favourite for the first family who also went cycling there during their 
previous two summers on the island off the Massachusetts coast.

The President, who was wearing a 
cycle helmet, appeared to have learnt his lesson from his bike ride 
there two years ago when he sparked complaints from bike-safety 
advocates after he was photographed without a helmet.
