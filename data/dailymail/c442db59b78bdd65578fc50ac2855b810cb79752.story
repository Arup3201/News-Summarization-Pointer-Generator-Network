Daniel Boulud, one of New York’s most celebrated Michelin-starred chefs has been coming up short when it comes to paying his servers their appropriate wages and tips.

A multimillion-dollar class action lawsuit accuses the celebrity chef of pocketing the gratuities from private events held at his restaurants, and forcing servers to perform non-tipped work on the side.

The extra work sees them paid at the same low rate as if they were waiting tables and includes menial tasks such as cleaning bathrooms, taking out the garbage and vacuuming floors.

Usually, a worker performing such tasks would be paid at a higher rate of $8-an-hour (the minimum wage), but they instead receive only $5 an hour for tipped work.

Sneaky chef: Chef Daniel Boulud has an international food empire that includes more than a dozen restaurants and nearly as many cookbooks, yet a lawsuit alleges he has found ways to pay servers less than they are entitled

Mr. Boulud’s troubles highlight a pervasive problem in the restaurant industry.

While high-end restaurants  are dependent on immigrant labor, and many of those workers have advanced, most find themselves cornered in lower-paying jobs.

The plaintiffs are servers, Edison Lopez, Carlos Cruz Cacildo and Justin Wands. The trio are confident that their lawsuit will stand.

'Daniel is one of the best restaurants, not only in New York or the US, but in the world,' the servers’ attorney Brian Schaffer told the New York Post.

Sous chef! Daniel Boulud faces a multimillion-dollar lawsuit that claims he stiffed his servers on wages and tips

'Workers deserve to be treated fairly,' he said, and estimated the pool of plaintiffs could eventually reach 500.

The servers are seeking unspecified damages for tips and wages going back to 2008.

During that time, the French chef has earned heaps of accolades, including coveted Michelin stars, yet none of the glory is passed down to those who work to keep the restuarant running on a daily basis.

Meanwhile, customers pay up to $220 for a prix-fixe tasting menu at a number of Mr Boulud's restaurants.

Some servers have already spoken out about the unfair payments.

Graciela Roman worked as a busser at Bar Boulud and Boulud Sud between 2007 and 2012.

She says she spent much of her shift doing 'side work' such as sweeping and taking out garbage.

However while she was doing that, she 'was wrongfully paid the lower, tipped-credit minimum wage rate, rather than the non-tipped minimum wage.'

Eponymous: Daniel, his flagship New York City namesake, was awarded three Michelin stars in the 2010 Michelin, the book's highest rating. In January of 2013, Daniel NYC was inducted into Culinary Hall of Fame

Ms.Roman also claims she was 'required to engage in a tip distribution scheme' and that she was not compensated for overtime work.

Although the federal Fair Labor Standards Act does allow employers to pay their workers a lower minimum wage if those employees receive tips, the law requires that the employee’s wages and tips combined must equal at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour

If the employee does not receive enough tips to reach the standard minimum wage, the employer is required to provide the employee with sufficient wages to make up the rest.

According to the lawsuit, 'The Boulud restaurants have a corporate policy or practice of minimizing labor costs by unlawfully taking a tip credit against the minimum wage rate'.

It is an unfortunate fact that, in efforts to cut costs by businesses, employees are often the ones who suffer the consequences.

On the line: The servers are seeking unspecified damages for tips and wages going back to 2008

There are laws in place, though, to prevent employers from taking advantage of their employees.

The wage and hour class action lawsuit was filed against the chef in 2012.

In 2013 Boulud tried to end the proceedings by denying Roman’s allegations but the judge denied Boulud’s request saying that the case was too fact-intensive and could not be rushed.

Earlier this year, Boulud chose to settle the lawsuit (which is separate, yet similar in nature).

The chef continues to insist that he has done nothing wrong and that no laws were broken in any of his restaurants.

The settlement covers about ninety employees who worked as servers in several of Boulud’s restaurants in New York and were paid the lower minimum wage of employees who allegedly should be receiving tips.

Boulud, one of the world's most 
respected chefs, has written numerous cookbooks and presides over a 
fleet of restaurants stretching from New York and Miami to London and 
Asia.

His New York City restaurant Daniel, now 20 years old, holds a coveted three Michelin stars.
