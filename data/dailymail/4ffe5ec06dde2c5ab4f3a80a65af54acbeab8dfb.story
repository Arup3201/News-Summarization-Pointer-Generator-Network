For some, the idea of cutting Britain's ties with Europe is a way of returning the country to a simpler and more independent time.

However, according new research, the British relationship with Europe dates back far further than was previously thought.

Scientists have discovered that stone-age hunter gatherers in England were trading with continental wheat farmers 8,000 years ago - long before agriculture came to Britain.

Researchers from the University of Warwick were able to isolate DNA from sediment core samples taken by divers from the sea floor below the cliffs on the north coast of the Isle of Wight, as shown in the picture above

They have found DNA for einkorn wheat buried within coastal sediments around the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England.

A study of ancient human bones has revealed how Early Europeans had difficulties digesting milk around 5,000 years after the introduction of farming.

It took at least that long for their genes to evolve until they were no longer intolerant to lactose, the natural sugar in mammalian milk, scientists suggests.

Researchers looked at ancient DNA extracted from 13 individuals buried at archaeological sites in the Great Hungarian Plain - a region known to have been at the crossroads of cultural change in European prehistory.

The scientists also found changes in prehistoric technology, such as the adoption of farming, were linked with a significant influx of new people.

For instance, in the Neolithic or New Stone Age, ancient central Europeans had an appearance closer to Sardinians.

In the Iron Age, there is another shift, with people coming into Central Europe from the East, such as the Caucasus or Asia.

Researchers claim that tolerance to lactose only appeared in the Bronze Age, around 4,000 years after these people began dairying.

Before then, most humans were lactose intolerant, and only later evolved the ability to break down this sugar in animal milk.

However agriculture is not known to haarrived in Britain until around 6,000 years ago and scientists have found no evidence of wheat cultivation or pollen in the sediments.

Instead they believe local hunter-gatherers bought the wheat by trading with European farmers from as far away as the south of France or the Balkans.

This means that even 8,000 years ago there must have been trade routes winding their way across the European continent to Britain across an ancient land bridge.

The scientists say that the discovery shows that Britain was no-where near as isolated or insular as had been originally thought.

They say the findings may also force a complete rethink about how agriculture first arrived in Britain.

Dr Robin Allaby, a plant geneticist at the University of Warwick who led the research, said: 'Eight thousand years ago the people of mainland Britain were leading a hunter-gatherer existence, whilst at the same time in southern Europeans farming was gradually spreading across Europe.

'Common throughout Neolithic Southern Europe, einkorn is not found elsewhere in Britain until 2,000 years after the samples found at Bouldnor Cliff.

'For the einkorn to have reached this site there needs to have been contact between Mesolithic Britons and Neolithic farmers far across Europe.

'The land bridges provide a plausible facilitation of this contact.

'As such, far from being insular, Mesolithic Britain was culturally and possibly physically connected to Europe.'

The researchers suggest the wheat was brought to Britain by neolithic traders from southern Europe

Einkorn wheat, like that pictured above, is thought to be one of the first plants to have been domesticated

The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal Science, used new DNA extraction and analysis techniques to extract DNA from underwater sediments.

They obtained sediment cores from Bouldnor Cliff on the north coast of the Isle of Wight, an area that had once been dry land before the end of the last ice age.

Using the ancient sedimentary DNA, or sedaDNA, the scientists were able to reconstruct a picture of the plants and animals left behind there by the mesolithic people who inhabited the area.

Among the native plants they found DNA sequences that matched those of near eastern strains of wheat.

Professor Vince Gaffney, chair of landscape archaeology at the University of Bradford who was also involved in the study, said: 'We don't think it was grown here. We think it was traded across Europe.

'What that tells us is that these societies weren't isolated and they weren't simple.

The scientists developed a new technique to extract DNA preserved in underwater sediments like above

'Wheat, of course, is a signature for farming but this is 2,000 years before the onset of framing in Britain, and at this time the nearest farmers were either in the south of France or possibly as far away as the Balkans, thousands of miles across continental Europe.

'This tells us rather than the traditional model of farming arriving with colonists or some sort of invasion, the ideas and concepts of farming must have arrived several thousand years earlier.'

Dr Greger Larson, a palaeogeneticist at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, said the technology used to extract DNA in the study could revolutionise our understanding of history.

He said: 'The ability to sequence DNA no longer associated with the macroscopic remains from which it originated presents a range of possibilities that begins with a refinement of accepted chronologies.

'The unexpectedly early appearance of wheat in Britain should force a rethinking of both the strength of the relationships between early farmers and hunter-gatherers, and the origins of settled agricultural communities in Europe.'
