Wounded: Lisa Simmons was shot in the legs last year by her boyfriend during a camping trip

A woman who almost died after her boyfriend mistook her for a hog on a camping trip and shot her has revealed that the couple are closer than ever.

Lisa Simmons, 51, was looking for sour oranges in the woods in Flagler County, Florida in April last year as her boyfriend sought out hogs when she was knocked to the ground in pain.

Simmons, who has worked as a nurse for heart doctors for 18 years, looked down to see she had been shot through the thighs and was quickly losing blood.

'I don't want to die out here in these woods,' she thought, she told the Tampa Bay Times.

She
called out for her boyfriend, Steve Egan, and used his belt to make a 
tourniquet as they called 911 from their cell phone.

Egan frantically apologized and
told her how much he loved her as they waited.

With
their cell battery low, it took nearly an hour for the helicopter to 
find them, and by that point, Simmons had lost a great deal of blood.

She
was rushed to Dayton Beach Hospital, where doctors operated on her 
throughout the night. She nearly died twice and needed 14 pints of 
blood, the Times reported.

When she awoke, she was missing
four inches of her thigh bone and doctors initially said they were 
worried they might have to amputate, but she pulled through.

While the couple realized the severity 
of the situation, many others at the time did not, including comedian 
Jay Leno and DJ Bubba the Lovesponge, who poked fun at Simmons for being mistaken for a hog following
the shooting.

But
despite these jibes and her life-changing injuries - Simmons can no 
longer stand long enough for a nursing shift and is training as a 
nursing teacher - she said she does not blame her boyfriend of nine 
years.

'I don't think you can go through 
something like this and not get closer, if you really love somebody,' 
Simmons told the Times. 'We don't have any issues between us.'

Recovery: She underwent all-night surgery at hospital, pictured, but is now able to walk again

Simmons, who has moved from using a scooter to a cane to walking alone, remains upbeat.

'At least I'm still alive,' she said. 'I still have both legs and I've got a really good story to tell her some day.'

Her boyfriend was unable to move on so easily and whenever he saw his girlfriend limp, the guilt would flood back. He eventually sought counseling for post-traumatic stress.
