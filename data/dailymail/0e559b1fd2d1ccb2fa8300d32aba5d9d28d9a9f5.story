Jean-Marc Ayrault has backed plans for a Roma gypsy camp in one of Paris's most exclusive neighbourhoods saying there is no reason it wouldn't work

The prime minister of France has infuriated cabinet colleagues by backing plans to set up a Roma gypsy camp in one of the most affluent districts of Paris.

Jean-Marc Ayrault, one of the most traditional Socialists in his government, said he could see no reason why the plan for the 16th arrondissement should not be a success.

‘Why not?’ he said, when told about the project put forward by elected officials from the Leftish Front.

It would see thousands of mainly Romanian gypsies setting up their caravans and huts around a chic area renowned for its upmarket shops and restaurants.

This is despite efforts by successive French governments to smash the camps to pieces and to deport the gypsies who live in them.

Such issues will be of particular interest to Britain, which is preparing to welcome thousands of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants next year when EU labour laws revised.

Last month Mr Ayrault’s colleague Manuel Valls, the Interior Minister, said it was ‘an illusion to think that we can solve the Roma problem through integration.’

Mr Valls wants to do everything possible to keep the Roma out of France, as he associates them with crime and public health problems.

His views were supported by a BVA poll
 which revealed that 77 per cent of French people agreed that Roma were 
inherently ‘different’.

But
 the more liberal Mr Ayrault said the gypsies could be integrated into 
French life, adding: ‘Solutions can be found, as long as the people in 
question respect the Republic’s laws.’

The Roma have long been victimised across Europe for their associations with poverty and crime

This is  the town of Yambol, a fomer attempt to integrate the Roma in Bulgaria that ended up by being demolished by the gypsies it once sheltered

The 16th arrondissement is the Paris equivalent of Hampstead in London – full of extremely rich residents and expensive properties.

Ian Brossat, of the Leftist Front, said: ‘Ten thousand of the seventeen thousand Roma immigrants who live in France live in Paris in conditions of extreme poverty.’

Many are in shanty towns on the edge of the capital, from where they take public transport into the city to beg and steal.

The news will alarm some in the UK who fear an influx of the travellers after boarder controls with Romania are relaxed next year

In France the irony has long been acknowledged that wealthy liberals want to integrate foreigners, but not near their own homes

Mr Brossat said putting them in the large, prosperous 16th would make them feel more integrated, especially as there was plenty of space for a new camp.

Claude Goasguen, the conservative mayor of the 16th arrondissement, said the proposed plan was an ‘outlandish’ one, and should be opposed at all costs.

Many have pointed to the hypocrisy of rich Paris liberals who call for more efforts to be made integrating immigrants, while refusing to have them anywhere near their own homes.
