A Florida congressional hopeful has revealed howÂ fatally striking a pedestrian with his car when he was 16 'still weighs heavy on my heart'.

David Jolly, a Republican battling to represent Florida's 13th Congressional District, questioned why stories about the 1989 crash had resurfaced so shortly ahead of the March 11 election.

He was found not to be at fault for the death of 30-year-old Blair Ropes, who was struck on June 9, 1989 as he walked along the side of a busy road in Tampa after his motorcycle broke down.

'It was a human tragedy that occurred when I was a young man,' Jolly, 41, told WTSP when they first asked him about the accident.

Speaking out: David Jolly, who is in a race for a special election in Florida, fatally hit a 30-year-old man with his car in 1989, but was not deemed to be at fault. He has said it took him a long time to find peace

'It took several years for me to get 
to a place of peace, but not something anybody would ever get over. I'll be honest, for several years it challenged my faith. I questioned how such things could happen, but tragedy occurs.'

In a statement, he added: 'This was a tragic accident where a 
man lost his life and a family lost a loved one. It continues to weigh heavy on my heart after 25 
years and we owe the family our deepest sympathies every day.'

WTSP-TV in St Petersburg first reported about the crash on Monday and an anonymous note was sent to the Tampa Bay Times about the 25-year-old incident.

'The facts of this accident have been public record for years,' Jolly added. 'It is disrespectful and hurtful to the surviving family that someone would now dig this tragedy up to use for political gain.

'Out of respect for the family and friends who lost a loved one, I will have no further comment.'

A 16-year-old Jolly was driving his father's car from a Tampa mall to Dade City, where he lived, with a female passenger at 9.30pm on the night of the crash.

Scene: The crash occurred on what is now Bruce B Downs Boulevard in Tampa. A man was walking along the road after his motorcycle broke down when Jolly, who was heading home from the mall, hit him

At the same time, Blair Ropes and his girlfriend Sandra Vendl were returning from the mall but Ropes' motorcycle broken down and the pair started to walk for assistance.

Ropes, who was wearing black and walking with the flow of the traffic, was struck by Jolly's right front bumper. The troopers' report noted that there was no sidewalk along the road.

Ropes was thrown 147 feet and was pronounced dead on the scene.

The report said that Jolly did not 
stop and instead drove to a nearby convenience store to call emergency 
workers. He then returned to the scene and told troopers he had not seen Ropes.

Vendl told troopers at the 
time that she was not hurt, but several weeks later she said she had been struck 
and had an injured elbow.

Troopers wrote in their report that Ropes was at fault in the crash because he was not facing oncoming traffic as he walked, a violation of Florida law. Jolly did not face any charges.

Jolly is in a tight race with Democrat Alex Sink to replace the late Republican
 Bill Young in the 13th Congressional District. The special election has spurred a multimillion-dollar ad war.

At work: Jolly, who is pictured with supporters last November, slammed the person who brought the crash to the attention of the media, saying it would just cause the victim's family more hurt

Battle: He is fighting Democrat Alex Sink, pictured Tuesday, for the seat in the special election on March 11

Republicans have attacked Sink over Obama's health care law, while Democrats have linked 
Jolly to the GOP's far-right. Jolly believes the resurfacing of his crash story is yet another tactic.

He added to WTSP: 'I
 don't know who has pushed this story, but I believe it to be a 
heartless individual who has clearly never lost anyone close to them or 
experienced such a tragedy.'

Deails also surfaced this week that Jolly took a homestead credit in the same year at his Florida condo and a home in Washington, D.C.

Jolly campaign spokeswoman Sarah Bascom said that when Jolly bought his D.C. home in 2007, paperwork was mistakenly filed for a homestead exemption, but Jolly quickly fixed it.

He returned a $264 tax credit and had the homestead credit removed, she said.

Jolly has no children and is currently going through a divorce after being married for 15 years.
