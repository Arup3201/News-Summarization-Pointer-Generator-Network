The Spring Freeze once again tightened its grip yesterday when snow started to fall across London and parts of the South East.

A flurry of sleet and snow fell on the capital at lunchtime yesterday, although forecasters said it was due to be nothing more than a 'light dusting'.

Temperatures are expected to remain low until next week, when a low-pressure system from the Atlantic could bring some 'slightly less-cold air'.

But despite the freezing temperatures and flurries of snowfall, forecasters said next week would usher in comparatively balmy conditions of 13C.

John Lee, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said Saturday will generally 
feel less cold as the winds become lighter, although there could be 
wintry showers in the North.

A slight change however could be just around the corner next week.

Mr Lee said: 'There's a lot of 
uncertainty with times at the moment, but there seems to be a low 
pressure system from the Atlantic which is going to try and feed in some
 slightly less-cold air to the UK.

'Along
 with that it's going to bring some rain - we don't know exactly where 
but it looks like much of the UK will see some rain going into Monday.'

Forecasts have also suggested things could return to more like what would be expected in April by the end of next week.

Mr
 Lee said: 'Looking five or six days ahead from now, towards the end of 
next week, temperatures could be returning towards average, but nothing 
particularly warm.'

A spring flower show held for 138 years had to be cancelled in Kent yesterday as snow fell across the county.

Brenchley and Matfield Horticultural 
Society announced the continuous freezing weather had resulted in no 
entries in the tulips and camellias categories.

And other spring flowers such as daffodils were in very short supply.

Society spokesman Colin Brown said for this reason the show, due to be held last Saturday, was axed.

He said: 'The weather has got the better of us. It has been so cold that so many flower classes will have nothing in them such as the tulips, camellias and spring flowers.

'Nothing has come into flower yet as well as very few daffodils.

'I often enter the majority of the 40 or so flower classes but this year I would be hard pressed to enter six classes and it seems most of our members are having the same problem.'

Meanwhile, wintry showers and sub-zero temperatures affected most parts of Kent.

Major roads such as the M20 and M2 were hit by the snow which settled in some places.

But this did not stop some motorists ignoring the need for safe driving.

Kent Police's traffic unit tweeted 
how officers had reported a motorist being stopped on the M20 for 
speeding at 95mph in the snow.

Yesterday saw contrasts across the British Isles, with the warmest temperatures at Helen's Bay in Northern Ireland where it was 10C, and 8C on the Isle of Skye.

But it was 0C in Wych Cross, Sussex, and Kenley, Surrey.

Last April the northern half of the UK saw up to 25cm of snow.

The snowiest April on record was in 1981 when between 50cm and 60cm fell across the Forest of Dean and Gloucestershire.

More than 5,000 Britons could have died last month because of the freezing weather, it was feared today.

New figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that, in the first three weeks of last month, 4,206 more deaths than usual were recorded.

A further 1,000 extra deaths are expected to have been recorded for the final week of the month - lifting the March total to 5,000 more than normal.

It is believed that the freezing temperatures and snow could be partly to blame for these extra deaths - which were mainly among older people. A rise in flu cases could also be partly responsible.

The overall death toll in the first three weeks of March was 33,500, compared with a previous average of 29,294 for the past five years.

A Department of Health spokeswoman said the full details about cold weather deaths would not be made available by the Government until October - giving statisticians time to make a detailed study.

She said : 'We are concerned to see an increase in deaths, but these figures are provisional and should be treated with caution.'

She added that an extra £330million had been made available this winter for the NHS and social care.

The greatest rise in deaths came during the third week of March when the death toll was 1,600 higher than normal at 11,075.

Shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne said: 'When winter weather bites, we have all got a responsibility to look in on older neighbours and relatives.

'Older people need to keep warm but soaring gas and electricity prices are making this harder than it should be.'

Mr Gwynne said that social services were struggling after more than £1.3billion was cut from town hall budgets for care of the elderly.

He said: 'Families are being left without adequate support for their loved ones. Ministers need to make sure that older people are getting the care they need.'
