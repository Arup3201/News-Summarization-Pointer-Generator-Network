A New York investment banker has been charged with 'physical and psychological abuse' that includes bizarre sex acts against his French ex-wife. 

Miryam Allam, 31, claims she was subject to years of violence, including being forced into sex against her will and being burnt by a cigar.

Ms Allam is seeking unspecified damages from her high-rolling ex-husband, who she claims called her a 'bitch' and 'ejaculated on her face' when she refused to call him the 'most powerful man in the world'.

'Husband from hell', financier Jason Myers, 44, is accused of assault, battery, false imprisonment and causing emotional distress.

The French native also claims Meyers, who called himself 'Prince Charming', tried to get her kicked out of the country.

Once, after she was slapped in the face and had her hair pulled in public, Meyers admitted to Ms Allam 'that seeing her upset turned him on', reports the New York Daily News.

The couple is believed to have met in 
Geneva in 2007, when Ms Allam was working as an assistant at Meyers' 
private equity firm Aspatuck Holdings, which is based in Manhattan.

Allegations: Ms Allam claims five months after they began dating, Meyers slapped her after she complained they didn't spend enough time together

Meyers - who already had an ex-wife, Natasha Meyers, a divorce lawyer - wooed Ms Allam with lavish holidays and romantic dinners, reports the New York Daily News.

But the fairytale relationship soon came to an end.

Five months after they began dating, Meyers slapped Ms Allam after she complained they didn't spend enough time together, she claims. 

She alleges what then emerged was a pattern of abuse: physical and emotional violence followed by repeated apologies and gifts.

Ms Allam says she was given a daily allowance of $10 to $20 by Meyers, who is the CEO of the Aspatuck Holdings and TriMedia Entertainment Group.

She claims she was also prevented 
from speaking to her family and friends and was beaten and called a 
'prostitute' for wearing make-up he didn't like.

Once
 she found a photograph of Meyers and his first wife who 'was wearing a 
very short black leather dress and holding a whip, and Jason had a mask 
with metal chains around his body', according to the report.

Ms Allam says she was attacked after confronting Meyers with the image, who then 'slapped her and ordered her never to touch it again'.

When Ms Allam fell pregnant in June 2009, she did not leave her then boyfriend despite her reports of his increasingly disturbed behaviour. 

The couple married in a ceremony at New York's City Hall on October 2, after he proposed at the Boathouse in Central Park.

Ms Allam stated that she stayed with Meyers because she thought he would see the error of his ways.

'I trusted him and I loved him and I kept thinking things would change,' she said.

But just two weeks after the wedding, Meyers was arrested for cutting Ms Allam's face with glass at his house in Huntington, Long Island. 

Ms Allam says that when she once asked her then husband why he treated her badly, his response was as cruel as the violence he dealt out.

'Don't act like a dog if you don't want to be treated like a dog', she claims he said.

Meyers' attorney, Steven Altman, told the jury at the trial that Ms Allam 'frequently was drunk, out with other men and flaunting it in [Meyers'] face'. 

The couple divorced on October 18 2009, fifteen days after they wed.
