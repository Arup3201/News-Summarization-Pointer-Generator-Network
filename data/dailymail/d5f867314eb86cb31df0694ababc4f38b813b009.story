David 'Bumble' Lloyd offers his observations from the ICC Cricket World Cup. This time the former England batsman talks free trams, Steve Smith's strange dinner date and England's expectations.

CO-HOSTS WITH THE MOST 

I’ve been here a long time already working on the Big Bash and the Tri-series and I can tell you that Australia are an awesome side. 

I’ve been camped up in the fantastic city of Melbourne for the past two weeks where one of the attractions is that the trams are free (in the city centre) - which I’m sure will appeal to Nasser Hussain...

Australia, here celebrating a wicket in their final warm-up against UAE, look to be an awesome side

Melbourne's trams are free of charge in the city centre, a cost Bumble says appeals to Nasser Hussain

SMITHY IS BATTY 

Bumped into Steve Smith - who led Australia so well during Michael Clarke’s absence in their recent Test series against India - in a restaurant with his partner and would you believe he had his bat with him? 

He almost left it behind! I nearly took it but eventually called out to his young lady: ‘He’s left his bat!’ 

Aussies seem to take their bats everywhere.

Run machine Steve Smith has such a close connection to his bat that he takes it out for dinner

COME ON ENGLAND! 

What about England? 

They’re not favourites but they are working their nuts off and reaching the semi-final would be a good effort. 

In their last game, against Pakistan, they hit only 250. Must do better. But all I can say is: ‘Come on England! And Scotland and Ireland, too.’
