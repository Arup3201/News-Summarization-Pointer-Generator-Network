Pippa Middleton- or more accurately her pert derriere- burst into the media spotlight when she was Maid of Honour to her big sister on her wedding day in 2011.

Since then there has been much talked of the 31-year-old's toned physique.

Known to be a keen sports woman, Pippa recently revealed a set of exercises she swears by to maintain her enviable figure and almost spherical bottom, but much to the relief of those hoping to achieve her body, the party planner admits she is less than strict with her diet.

In fact, the Duchess of Cambridge's sister confesses in  her first Mind & Body column for Waitrose Weekend, to indulging in foods that most trying to watch their figure would run a mile from.

Chocolate, crisps  and wine regularly pass her lips, and Pippa claims the real 'secret' to her body is moderation, portion control and regular exercise. 

'I grew up with the belief that good health is about moderation in all things, so I'll be celebrating healthy living through exercise, and a little of the naughty stuff sprinkled in - I'm talking chocolate, crisps and occasional glass of wine,' Pippa states in the magazine.

And despite the rumours that she joined her sister in a strict no-carb diet in the run up to the Royal Wedding, Pippa insists she has never gone on a fad diet.  

Known to be a keen sportswomen, Pippa recently, much to the relief of those hoping to achieve her body, admits she is less than strict with her diet, indulging in chocolate, crisps and wine 

'I've never done Dukan, attempted Atkins of exercised religiously seven days a week but I do believe in making healthy choices - keeping refined carbs such as white bread and pasta to a minimum, and sticking to sensible portion sizes.'

Instead of restrictive diets she uses exercise to hone her body, sharing  the simple 30-minute total body workout that helps her achieve her toned behind. 

She swears by four key exercises - ladders, plié squats, wall pushes and the 'classic plank' - that are 'quick and great for toning all over'.

Each exercise takes around two minutes to perform, and she recommends a 30 second break between the moves with a two minute rest at the end of each circuit. 

Pippa says she tries to exercise at least three, and ideally five, times a week and claims it helps her sleep, digestion, mood and energy.

And this is only the first of many insights we will be getting into the health and diet of Pippa- and potentially all the Middleton clan

She has now been given a monthly column in Waitrose Weekend Magazine in which to share her diet and exercise tips.

She already writes for the supermarket’s food publication Waitrose Kitchen and now plans to share her ‘personal philosophy of healthy eating and exercise’.
