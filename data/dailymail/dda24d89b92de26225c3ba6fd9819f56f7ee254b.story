Lawyers have uncovered new evidence they say proves an innocent man has spent ten years in prison for the murder of a student.

They claim CCTV footage obtained from close to the murder scene in Bournemouth ‘decimates’ the testimony of the main prosecution witness.

Other evidence obtained by Omar Benguit’s defence team suggests the culprit may be Danilo Restivo, known as the hair fetishist killer.

After three trials, Benguit, 39, was jailed for life in 2005 for the murder of Jong-Ok Shin, 26, known as Oki.

The main prosecution witness, a 
heroin user and prostitute, had said Benguit and two men flagged down 
her car on the night of the murder on July 12, 2002.

She says she drove Benguit close to the spot where Oki was killed and he later returned covered in blood.

But Benguit’s defence team checked 
footage from a CCTV camera trained on the road close to the murder scene
that the witness insisted she drove along.

They examined 20 minutes either side of the time of the attack and say they found no trace of the car on the film.

The Mail on Sunday can also reveal 
that lawyers have obtained a pathologist’s report that demonstrates that
Oki’s wounds are consistent with the knife found on Restivo, 39, when 
he was arrested in 2004.

Doubts over the safety of the 
Benguit’s conviction have long existed and the Criminal Cases Review 
Commission is now investigating whether Restivo killed Oki.

Concerns about Benguit’s conviction 
intensified after Restivo – who lived close to Oki – was jailed for life
in June last year for the murder in 2002 of seamstress Heather Barnett,
48, in Bournemouth. 

Dorset Police last night declined to comment on the new CCTV evidence.

Des Jensen, who is part of Benguit's legal team, said: 'We are confident it will be sent to the Court of Appeal.'

Benguit's sister Amy Benguit said:
'Everything is in the CCRC's hands and we have got to be patient 
because they have got to carry out their own investigation.

'Omar is feeling very positive. He 
will never ever say he did something if he didn't. He said he would 
rather come out in a coffin than admit to something he didn't do.

'I know he will be handed leave to 
appeal. A lot of mistakes were made along the way. I don't really want 
to blame anyone - all we want is justice for Omar and Oki.'

Barry Loveday, a reader of criminal justice studies at Portsmouth University, has spent months investigating Miss Shin's murder.

He said: 'There are similarities in 
Oki Shin's killing and Danilo Restivo's modus operandi, like the use of a
very long bladed knife.

'The likelihood of two killers 
wandering around with similar knives three streets apart in Charminster 
at about the same time is very, very small.

'The likelihood of two murders by two individuals three streets and four months apart is frankly unbelievable.

'One must conclude that one can probably link up the murder of Oki Shin to Danilo Restivo as well.'

Restivo arrived in Britain in 
March 2002 and was placed under intense surveillance since he became a 
suspect in Miss Barnett's murder soon after her death.

When previously asked whether 
Restivo was responsible for any other killings, Detective Superintendent
Stuart Cooper said: 'As far as we're aware there are no other victims -
we're not actively looking for or concerned about anyone else.

'Restivo arrived in Britain in March 
2002, Heather was killed in November and we've been watching him 
carefully since then - it's a relatively short window of time.

'I don't think you can ever be totally
sure but without any credible evidence to say there are further 
suspicions it's difficult to say.'

Asked whether Dorset police would 
be re-opening the Oki Shin murder, a spokesman said: 'Omar Benguit was 
convicted of Oki Shin's murder. He lodged and appeal and that was 
dismissed.

'We understand that following an application on behalf of Mr Benguit to the CCRC a review is being conducted.'
