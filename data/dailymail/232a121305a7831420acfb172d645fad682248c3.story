A leader of the Pakistani Taliban has been killed by a US drone strike, security officials said today.

Wali-ur-Rehman, deputy commander of the Tehreek-e-Taliban was one of seven people killed in the attack in the North Waziristan region on Wednesday.

Wali-ur-Rehman was poised to take over the leadership of the Pakistani Taliban, which is a separate entity and ally to the Taliban in Afghanistan, and his death is a major blow in the fight against the militants in the area.

The drone attack is the first since the country’s general election on May 11 where the U.S.’s use of the unmanned aircrafts was one of the most debated issues.

One Pakistani security official said the death of the senior Taliban was a ‘huge blow to militants and a win in the fight against insurgents’.

The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have launched devastating attacks against the Pakistani military and civilians in the Pashtun areas along the Afghan border.

Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan spokesman Ihsanullah Ihsan said the group did not have ‘confirmed reports’ that Wali-ur-Rehman had been killed and declined to comment any further.

Drone casualties are difficult to verify as Taliban fighters also often seal off the sites of drone strikes immediately so the victims cannot be identified.

‘That the Taliban are remaining silent and neither denying or confirming the news is itself peculiar,’ said Saleem Safi, a Pakistani expert on the Taliban. ‘But if this news is true, then the Pakistan army has the U.S. to thank.’

The security officials and Pashtun tribesmen in the northwestern region said the drone fired two missiles that struck a mud-built house at Chashma village, two miles east of Miranshah, the region's administrative town.

They said seven people were killed and four wounded.

‘Tribesmen started rescue work an hour
after the attack and recovered seven bodies,’ said resident Bashir 
Dawar. ‘The bodies were badly damaged and beyond recognition.’

The
Pakistan government had yet to confirm Wali-ur-Rehman's death and its 
foreign ministry denounced drones following the Wednesday attack.

Hot debate: The US military's use of drones in Pakistan has been widely criticized as the strikes have many civilian victims

‘The government has consistently maintained that the drone strikes are counter-productive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives, have human rights and humanitarian implications and violate the principles of national sovereignty, territorial integrity and international law.’

U.S. President Barack Obama recently indicated he was scaling back the drone strike programme, winning cautious approval from Pakistan, a key ally in the U.S. fight on militancy.

North Waziristan is on the Afghan border and has long been a stronghold of militants including Afghan Taliban and their Al-Qaeda and TTP allies.

Prime Minister-elect Nawaz Sharif said this month that drone strikes were a ‘challenge’ to Pakistan's sovereignty.

‘We will sit with our American friends and talk to them about this issue,’ he said.
