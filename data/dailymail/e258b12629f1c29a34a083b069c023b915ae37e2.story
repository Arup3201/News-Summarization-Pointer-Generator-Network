Critical: The blade was plunged into the left temple of Eder Loor, who was responding to an emergency call

An NYPD police officer stabbed in the head has been described as the ‘luckiest unlucky man ever' by surgeons after miraculously surviving the brutal attack.

Officer Eder Loor, 28, was saved by a team of doctors who worked quickly and carefully to fix the wounds obtained in an altercation with a bipolar arrestee.

Describing how the flick-knife blade 
entered the skull, Dr Joshya Bederson said: ‘It was a millimeter from 
everything; it was ridiculous.

'You don’t want to overemphasize, but he 
was at death’s door. He was minutes away from crashing.'

Terrence Hale, 26, plunged the three-and-a-half inch blade deep into the left temple of Eder Loor, who was responding to an emergency call placed by the man’s mother

A bewildered officer Loor, 28, pulled knife, which had enter just above his eye, out of his head, apparently unaware he had been critically injured.

He was taken to Mount Sinai Medical 
Center ‘at death’s door’, but heroic surgeons acted quickly to stabilize him.

'It couldn't have been closer,' Dr Bederson said.

Man and wife: The first thing Officer Loor supposedly said to his partner was 'where is my wife?'

The married father-of-one, whose wife is expecting a their son, is now said to be conscious and talking.

Dr Bederson - who had been jogging in Central Park when he got the 
emergency call and ran straight to the hospital - told a news 
conference: ‘He is probably the luckiest unlucky man you could ever 
have.’

Medics had to remove a bone flap seven inches wide to relive pressure from the internal bleeding.

It is not yet fully known what damage may 
have been done to Officer Loor's brain following the confrontation with 
Hale in East Harlem on Tuesday.

The blade passed half an inch below an area of the brain that controls motor functions.

It was another half-inch entering a collection of nerves which control vision, according to Dr. Bederson.

Too close for comfort: Doctors said that Officer Loor was 'minutes' away from death

But it is understood the nerves that 
give sensation to the face were cut during the attack and a major artery
was damages, he added.

Officer Loor’s wife, Dina Loor, who 
sat beside the doctor during the press conference, said her husband's 
first words to her from his hospital bed were: ‘Babe, I’m fine. It just 
hurts,’ The New York Times reported.

More details are emerging about the 
incident Officer Loor and his partner Luckson Merisme were attending 
before the savage attack.

They were responding to a call to Franklin Plaza Apartments, a housing complex at 1945 Third Avenue, near 107th Street.

The suspect's mother Vearry Hale, 51,
had told police that her son, who has a history of mental illness, was 
acting irrationally and was emotionally disturbed.

She said he suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and had stopped taking his medications, according to police.

The violence broke out when Loor told the suspect he would have to be taken to hospital as his mother had asked.

'They approached him and told him that they would take him to a hospital,' Mayor Bloomberg said, according to the New York Post. 'He then produced a knife and attacked Officer Loor.'

The officer, who is married with a four-year-old daughter and is expecting a son, is said to be conscious and talking hours after the horrific incident.

He came out of surgery at Mt. Sinai Hospital at around 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday.

‘Today is another reminder that in a split second, a police officer’s life can be placed in great jeopardy,’ Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told CBS New York.

Hale was later charged with attempted aggravated murder, assault and criminal possession of a weapon, police said.

He had previously been arrested in 2002 for robbery and in 2006 for assault, according to police.

Hale’s mother has accused the police of mishandling the situation and said she was planning on contacting a lawyer.

‘They did not get backup, and they did not do their job right. My son was not feeling well; he was sick and said he wanted to go to the hospital,’ she told The Times.
