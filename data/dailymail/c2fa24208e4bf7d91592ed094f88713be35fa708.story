Remi Garde has emerged as a surprise leading candidate to become Brighton’s next manager.

Brighton, who lost in the play-offs to Derby, have begun the process of interviewing candidates and held a number of meetings.

Chris Hughton, who is anxious to get back straight into work after being sacked by Norwich, is high on their list, as is former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood, who has been long been the favourite with bookmakers. Former Celtic manager Neil Lennon is a candidate too.

French fancy: Remi Garde is being considered by Brighton after three years in charge of Lyon

But Garde is also being given serious consideration by Brighton’s ambitious owners, as they look to find a suitable replacement for Oscar Garcia, who offered his resignation after the defeat to Derby earlier this month.

The 48-year-old Frenchman ended a three-year spell in charge of Lyon at the end of last season, having lost the Europa League quarter-finals to Juventus and the French Cup final against Paris St Germain.

Garde cited 'personal reasons' and a desire to take a break from football but Brighton will sound him out to see if he wants the challenge of leading Brighton into the Barclays Premier League.

First time for everything: Phil Neville (C) could almost make his first move into management with the Seagulls

The Frenchman is best remembered in Britain for his spell playing for Arsenal in the late 1990s, where he won the title and FA Cup.

Brighton, who could have as many as seven men on their shortlist, are also keen on Phil Neville, whose future at Manchester United is uncertain as Louis van Gaal prepares to put his own stamp on the coaching staff at Old Trafford.

Neville was interviewed 12 months ago by Brighton before they appointed Garcia.

Lennon resigned his post as Celtic manager earlier this month.
