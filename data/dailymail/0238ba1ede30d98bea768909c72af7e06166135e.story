NFL player DeAngelo Williams has generously given up his business class seat to a Marine on his flight - but some fans have suggested he might have been duped.

The Carolina Panthers running back shared an image of his Delta plane ticket alongside a photo of the unsuspecting military man in uniform on his Twitter and Facebook pages on Monday morning.

'I always give up my seat to military if my seat is better!' Williams wrote. 'I truly appreciate our troops.'

He explained that the unidentified man was not aware of his act of generosity.

Kind gesture: NFL player DeAngelo Williams shared an image of his business class plane ticket and a photo of a man dressed in a military uniform on Monday, explaining he was giving up his seat to him

'He doesnâ€™t know it yet but he will be sitting in this seat when he boards the plane I always give up my 1st class seat! #isalutethetroops,' he wrote.

After he shared the images, fans applauded him for the move - but some others questioned whether the benefactor was indeed a Marine.

They suggested that he was a fake because he was wearing his hat inside and his badges were displayed incorrectly on his jacket.

'Unfortunately this guy is disrespecting the Marine Corps uniform,' one Facebook user, Eric Knight, wrote. 'NO Marine leaves a cover on indoors, and there shouldn't be a shooting badge worn with medals, and certainly not on the right breast pocket.'

Doubts: Some of Williams' Facebook fans said that the man in the photograph did not look like a Marine

Another user, Justin Amos, added: 'I'm gonna be honest here. He 
looks like a "faker".

'I'm a Marine and he is wearing his cover indoors. 
NO MARINE WEARS THEIR COVER INDOORS. Something is fishy DeAngelo 
Williams, don't give up your seat to him!'

But while some fans attacked the man in uniform, others said that Williams' kind act should not be overlooked.

'Even if he isn't really a marine, why focus on the negative?' Nicole Marie asked.

'DeAngelo did a really respectable thing by giving him his seat. It shows his character, and it's not his fault if this guy wasn't legitimately a marine.'

Patriot: Williams, pictured in photos on Instagram, said he always gave up seats to members of the military

Star: Williams, who plays for the Carolina Panthers, said he was happy with his decision to give up the seat

Williams, who also came under fire for posting about his act of kindness rather than just staying quiet about it, insisted on his page that he was happy with his choice.

'I always do that and for those of you that are saying I shouldn't have posted keep calm and enjoy my page and happy 4th of July (it's called being patriotic for life),' Williams wrote.

His gesture came just weeks after actress Amy Adams, whose father was in the military, traded her first class seat on an early-morning flight from Detroit to Los Angeles with a soldier.

The American Hustle star said the generous move was something she had always wanted to do, so she quietly arranged the swap on the Delta airlines flight with a flight attendant.

'I didn't do it for attention for myself,' the 39-year-old told Inside Edition after landing in LA. 'I did it for attention for the troops.'
