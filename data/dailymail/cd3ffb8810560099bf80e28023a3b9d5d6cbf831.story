Actor Ralf Little has been criticised after accusing Clarke Carlisle of not telling the full story

Actor Ralf Little has accused his former friend, Clarke Carlisle of not telling the 'full story' in his interview about the depression that led to his suicide attempt last year.

The Royle Family star said Carlisle was going to 'get away with it again' in reference to his interview about a battle with depression that caused him to step in front of a lorry days before Christmas.

Little tweeted a picture of the article, commenting: 'Oh dear. Looks like Clarke Carlisle's going to get away with it - AGAIN. #Teflon #nonstick.' 

His comment was met with a barrage of criticism from Twitter users, who accused him of being 'crass' and 'insensitive'.

The actor wrote: 'Seems people want context about previous tweet. So let me say, I know the full story and it's not what's portrayed in the media. That's all.'

Little and Carlisle had become friends in the early 2000s, but are thought to have fallen out when the footballer took the actor's bank card to fill Little's car with petrol. 

Instead, according to Carlisle's autobiography, he used the card to fund a drinking spree.

Little did not refer to the incident, thought to have taken place in 2003, but admitted on Twitter that he should not have used such a forum to make the comment.

Instead he wrote at length on the TwitLonger site to explain his view.

The actor explained that he and Carlisle 'have history', and that while he wishes Carlisle a strong recovery he does not feel sad for him any more.

However, he added he felt 'sad, and maybe a little angry' for Carlisle's wife Gemma, the footballer's children, and the lorry driver .

He added that the former footballer had been in touch with him to offer 'a retrospective apology over things that went on a long time ago', but said he had been 'drained' of sympathy for him.

Little wrote: 'There comes a point where it's just frustrating to witness someone constantly hammering the pattern of destruction for those around - and I was once one of those around - only to see the destructive force make a moving and sincere apology ... then do it again.'

He added: 'Though, as a final thought, I would say again, I’m a fool for forgetting that Twitter is not, and never will be, the place for a comment like that. It’s too reductive and simplistic, and yes, without context, I can see it would seem insensitive and crass. Not my intention.' 

Carlisle later responded to the actor's tweets using his wife Gemma’s account.

He wrote: 'Hi Ralf, it’s Clarke here. I have seen you once in 10 years, and that was to apologise for my repulsive behaviour as a young man.

'I know you have you're right to your opinion, but I've got to say, I sincerely hope that you're not the same person you were 10 years ago, as I very much am not. I hope you are well, happy and enjoying your excellent career. I pray depression never bites x'

In his autobiography, You Don't Know Me, But...: A Footballer's Life, Carlisle wrote about his friendship with Little.

He explained in his book that he had befriended Little and his two housemates  - a radio producer and band manager - after realising that he needed to make friends outside of football in order to keep his heavy drinking a secret from his team-mates.

Describing Little as a 'very self-assured guy', Carlisle wrote that for his new friend 'everything had an element of competition, whether it was drinking, dancing, women, Pro-Evolution Soccer, income, level of fame, everything.'

The actor had posted a series of Tweets including one which read 'Oh dear. Looks like Clarke Carlisle's going to get away with it - AGAIN'

He added: 'This triggered two things within me. Firstly, I wanted to be liked by all of these guys. This meant that I would say yes to everything. If there was a party I was there, a drink to be had I was there, an event to be seen at I was there. I wanted to be a part of the group. Secondly, I wanted to win. This may sound pathetic, but it is where I was at. I wanted to be cooler, I wanted to party harder, I wanted to be richer (or look richer if I wasn't), I wanted to impress him and everyone around us.'

Carlisle also said Little was 'desperate to be a footballer and genuinely believed he was good enough,' which had in turn spurred him on to live the actor's lifestyle and be a professional footballer.

Speaking of the bank card incident he wrote: 'It was so bad in my drinking days that at one point Ralf lent me his bank card to get some petrol for his car, but I took it to go on a bender for a couple of days, helping myself to cash out of his personal account.

In his autobiography Carlisle had written that Little, pictured at a Soccer Six event, was 'desperate to be a footballer and believed he was good enough'

'I still cringe to this day when I think back to some of those times when I was at my most desperate.

'It is part of my recovery programme to try to make amends to all those who you have wronged on your journey.

'I have repeatedly repented to all of my housemates, some of whom accepted it and some of whom didn't. I'm fine about that - just because I apologise doesn't make everything better. I had to face the consequences of my actions, which in this case meant I lost several friendships that I will never get back.'

Carlisle was left critically injured when he was struck by a lorry near his home on the morning of December 22 on the A64, near York.

He had to be airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary, with North Yorkshire Police confirming that an investigation was under way after a collision that ‘involved a male pedestrian and a lorry’.

Speaking to the The Sun newspaper he said he had thrown himself in front of the lorry in an attempt to take his own life, adding that his life had spiralled out of control after being told by ITV he was losing his £100,000-a-year Champions League pundit role.

He says he went straight to a casino and blew in one night what money he and his wife had before, only hours later on December 20, being charged with drink-driving.

Carlisle, who is also a former chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association, was due to appear at Highbury Magistrates' Court, in north London, last month to face the drink-driving charge but the hearing was adjourned until March.

‘I had to die,’ he said. ‘This wasn’t escaping or running away. This was the perfect answer. It made everyone happy and it ticked every box.’

He said he had sat in the police cell and concluded that he could not let his children ‘have a criminal father’. He said he walked out of the police station having decided he ‘had to die’.

Carlisle says he then vanished for 40 hours, sleeping rough while planning his suicide. Having found a spot on the A64, he then stepped over a barrier and jumped towards an oncoming lorry ‘like a shoulder charge’.

Carlisle said he had wanted to emulate Little's lifestyle. The actor is pictured with Steve Coogan and Johnny Vegas at a film premiere in 2002 - around the time he was friendly with Carlisle

‘I opened my eyes and I could see my hands in front of me and there’s blood dripping down them. I thought, “You’re kidding me”.’

At hospital it was discovered he had suffered only cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and a shattered left knee.

He said he had ‘overwhelming feelings of shame, guilt and embarrassment’

On Christmas Day, Carlisle was admitted to a psychiatric unit in Harrogate and placed on suicide watch. 

He is now having counselling, with The Sun claiming the police are taking no further action over the A64 crash.
