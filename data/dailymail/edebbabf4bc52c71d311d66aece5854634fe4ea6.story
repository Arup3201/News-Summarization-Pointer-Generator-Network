By the time people wake up tomorrow morning it will be clear whether Scotland is to become an independent country or remain in the United Kingdom.

Scotland’s chief counting officer Mary Pitcaithly is pencilled in to announce the historic result at 7am from the Royal Highland Centre in Ingliston outside Edinburgh.

Hints of what the outcome is likely to be will drip in through the night as Scotland’s towns and cities release their results.

But tonight it emerged that thick fog in the Western Isles could disrupt the count in the  referendum.

Western Isles Council is working with the pilot of a chartered plane which is waiting in Oban to fly to Benbecula to take ballot boxes from the southern half of the Western Isles.

Discussions are ongoing over when to make a final decision to abort the flight and call-in a fishing boat to transport the ballot boxes by sea.

However, the contingency plan to get a shellfish boat to carry the ballot boxes may also be hindered if the sea route is also affected by the heavy mist. 

Despite that, the first results will be announced at 2am with the key areas of Inverclyde and North Lanarkshire ones to watch.

Both are fertile ground for the ‘Yes’ campaign and Alex Salmond will be desperate for a strong show of support for independence.

The two central belt local authorities are relatively poor with few voters born outside Scotland.

A strong ‘Yes’ showing in Inverclyde and North Lanarkshire will give an early sign that Scotland’s future in the Union really is hanging by a thread.

Working class Scots – and in particular, middle aged men in deprived towns – have moved strongly into Mr Salmond’s ‘Yes’ camp.

But if the No campaign manages a good turnout, Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling will be able to breathe a sigh of relief that the result is shifting their way.

The next counts to watch for are Dumfries and Galloway, and Falkirk – which are both being called at 3am.

Dumfries and Galloway is a rare Tory strong hold in Scotland which is heavily unionist.

The ‘No’ campaign needs a strong showing on a good turnout to keep any momentum it may have gained earlier in the night.

But if the nationalists manage a good showing in this ‘No’ heartland it will point to problems for the Union.

Falkirk is the next big hope for the Yes campaign, with Mr Salmond needing a strong showing here before Scotland’s big cities take their turn to announce.

The Union flag, held aloft over Edinburgh last night, may fly in Scotland for the last time if the 'Yes' campaign mobilises its working class supporters today

Glasgow and Edinburgh are both scheduled to declare at 5am – and with 860,000 voters between them account for one in five Scots.

Both cities are expected to reject independence – but stronger than expected support for independence could tip the referendum to Mr Salmond.

In recent polls the ‘No’ campaign had a 12 per cent lead in Glasgow. If this ends up being right, the Yes campaign will have needed to build up a big lead beforehand – or hope for a miracle afterwards.
