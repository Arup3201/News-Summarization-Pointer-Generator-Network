He is the inspiration for Hollywood film The Horse Whisperer and has been a trusted adviser to the Queen on her horses and corgis  for a quarter of a century.

Now Monty Roberts is using his gift to help British soldiers returning from the front line to tackle their post-traumatic shock disorder.

Monty has already pioneered his unconventional treatment with US troops at his Californian ranch.

And at his first UK ‘clinic’ last week for 30 veterans at Tedworth House, the Wiltshire base of charity Help For Heroes, Monty shared his system of ‘Join-Up’ – communication with a horse through movement.

‘This is a silent language,’ he explained to his audience

‘You can use this to build trust and to grow stronger. It’s phenomenal what these horses can teach you.’

Then it was the former soldiers’ turn to try moving a horse around the pen just by eye contact and clicks of the tongue.

After that they had to persuade the horse to come to them and encourage it to follow them round the ring, which all of them did successfully – to their evident delight.

Former paratrooper James Tattingham’s PTSD dates back to Afghanistan, when many of his friends were killed or injured.

James, 27, said: ‘I had a lot of nightmares. I kept a knife in my wardrobe and I would be on watch at the window at night. I had a really bad temper too.’

Andy Askew, 31, left the Army Air Corps last month and suffers ¿an exhausting emotional rollercoaster¿ of flashbacks to Afghanistan

After his session with a horse called Badger, he was impressed, saying it was in marked contrast to psychiatric help he had received.

‘The psychiatrist patronised me,’ he said, ‘but I felt really great doing this. I felt happy and I’m proud of myself. Monty and his team didn’t treat us like we were different – it was like they understood.’

Another to try the treatment was Andy Askew, 31, who left the Army Air Corps last month and suffers ‘an exhausting emotional rollercoaster’ of flashbacks to Afghanistan.

After working with a horse called George, the former sergeant was in tears.

‘I was really emotional,’ he said.

By royal appointment: Monty Robert, the horse whisperer, with the Queen at Windsor in 1989

‘It’s the most profound thing I have done. I’ve tried a lot of things to help with my PTSD, but that was a real surprise.

‘I loved the fact it was not just a connection with another living thing, but the fact it was complete silence.

‘I felt peaceful. And I haven’t felt peaceful for a long time.’

Monty Roberts could hardly have supporters in higher places. He told The Mail on Sunday that he discussed his initiative to help traumatised troops with the Queen just last week, and that he would love to have her grandsons, Princes William and Harry, as ambassadors.

Former movie stuntman Monty first became an adviser to the Queen in 1989 after she heard about his ability to tame wild horses.

He travels regularly to Britain to help train not only her horses but also the royal corgis and Prince Philip’s ponies.

‘I would love her grandsons to get involved,’ he said.

‘They are military through and through. I keep telling Her Majesty there is something very important here. She believes me about horses.

‘On the other hand she says, “The boys have their own lives and I can’t get them to answer the phone!” ’
