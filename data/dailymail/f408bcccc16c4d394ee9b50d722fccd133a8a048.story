Once seen widely as a currency attracting criminals, its reputation is now soaring - not to mention its price.

But users have reported several alarming recent thefts of Bitcoin, the digital currency taking the world by storm.

Invented in 2009, the global currency's anonymity and lack of control from any government makes it ideal for digital entrepreneurs, but also a prime target for hackers.

Vulnerable: Real-world bitcoins pictured in April. Hackers have attacked sites hosting the digital currency

In the most recent attack hackers stole 1,295 bitcoins worth more than $1 million from one of the world's biggest sites, the Coindesk news site reported.

The criminals attacked the servers of the Denmark-based Bitcoin Internet Payment System (BIPS), wiping its data.

They weakened the site by launching a catastrophic denial of service attack - where a server is bombarded with data until it collapses - before stealing the virtual currency.

Chief executive Kris Henriksen said the attackers may have been from Russia and neighbouring countries, Coindesk reported.

He wrote on the Bitcoin Forum: 'Please be advised that attacks are not isolated to us and if you are storing larger amounts of coins with any third party you may want to find alternative storage solutions as soon as possible.'

Security breach: Kris Henriksen, chief executive of the Danish Bitcoin Internet Payment System, said his site suffered a catastrophic hacking attack. He added: 'Several consumer wallets have been compromised'

A statement on the firm's website said: 'BIPS has been a target of a coordinated attack and subsequent security breached. Several consumer wallets have been compromised and BIPS will be contacting the affected users.

'As a consequence BIPS will temporarily close down the wallet initiative to focus on real-time merchant processing business which does not include storing of Bitcoins.

Suddenly the world is fascinated with Bitcoin - which has soared in value since the start of November.

It is currently worth about $1,100 per coin and yesterday one coin was worth more than an ounce of gold for the first time, it's claimed.

And it is hitting 'real life', with a cash machine in Vancouver, Canada, and a sushi restaurant in San Francisco dispensing and accepting the currency.

The virtual money - whose value is determined by no government, instead by a peer-to-peer network of mainly anonymous users - was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.

But that is not his real name - he, too, was anonymous.

The inventor released the coding for his currency in open-source form, and users can now create their own bitcoins.

It happens through a process called mining, which forces computers to solve algorithms so complex that the amount of power they take up limits how much currency can flood the market.

Its value works just like any undefinable commodity, with the same potential pitfalls.

In one of the most famous price bubbles, tulips took on enormous value in 17th Century Amsterdam with lovers of the flowers remortgaging their houses - before the price suddenly collapsed.

'BIPS will consider to reintroduce the wallet initiative with a re-architected security model.'

Angry users of the currency took to forums to protest at the loss of their money, including an anonymous user who lost 90 bitcoins (about $100,000).

The user said people who were affected should file a class-action lawsuit.

He admitted Bitcoin was the 'wild west' of currency but said: 'I think it's reasonable, fair, and legal for the affected individuals to get together and try to negotiate as a group for some kind of compensation.'

Meanwhile Czech website bitcash.cz had its entire balance stolen - which last month was estimated at about $100,000.

A statement on the firm's website said: 'On November 11, in the evening, there was a security breach on our server.

'The unknown attacker managed to convert the entire... balances in users' wallets.'

It also comes after Australian site TradeFortress claimed $1.3 million of Bitcoin were stolen three weeks ago - just as the currency's value began soaring.

Several sites which have fallen victim to the hackers, including TradeFortress, have been forced to deny accusations of an 'inside job'.

Such was the case with the Polish website Bidextreme, which put a long statement on its website last week.

It said: 'It is understood that in this situation you expect a detailed explanation, but we cannot make public information such as what data has been lost, what has been recovered, at what stage the proceedings [are] because it will harm the investigation.

'Your speculation, allusions and often accusations directly, not having the slightest basis in reality and posted on the forum are very hurtful, bring chaos and anxiety, as well as damage [our] image.'

We understand your bitterness, but 
please refrain from drawing conclusions and issuing extrajudicial [action] until 
the end of proceedings.'

Global: Nara Sushi, a restaurant in San Francisco, has begun accepting Bitcoin despite the controversy

Meanwhile in a separate issue, an entrepreneur who makes physical bitcoins - Mike Caldwell, from Salt Lake City, Utah - suspended all new orders on Thursday over unspecified 'regulatory issues'.

A statement on his blog said: 'For the time being, I have suspended accepting new orders, pending resolution of some concerns I have as to regulatory issues.

'I am anticipating a possibility of having to prequalify buyers, and am holding off taking orders until I know for sure.'
