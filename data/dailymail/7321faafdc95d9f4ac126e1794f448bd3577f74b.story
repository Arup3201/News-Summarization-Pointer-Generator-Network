Boris Johnson has admitted paying tradesmen in cash, after a government minister said it was 'morally wrong' to do so

David Gauke claimed that making small cash payments to cleaners and tradesmen was as bad as tax avoidance, which ministers have already called ‘morally repugnant’.

The Exchequer Secretary spoke out as he gave a speech outlining plans to name and shame those who engage in aggressive tax avoidance schemes to avoid paying their fair share.

Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, has admitted paying cash-in-hand after Tory Minister David Gauke, right, claimed such behaviour was 'morally wrong'

But asked today if he had ever paid in cash to keep costs down, London Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'I've certainly paid a lot of cash in hand.'

Under new rules, celebrities and millionaires who use tax avoidance schemes will see their details passed to HM Revenue and Customs.

But Mr Gauke raised eyebrows by suggesting that pensioners and families who pay cash to a cleaner, plumber or gardener are just as bad.

He said: ‘Getting a discount with your plumber by paying cash in hand is something that is a big cost to the Revenue and means others must pay more in tax.’

Asked explicitly if he disapproves of the practice, he said: ‘Yes, I think it’s morally wrong.’

He added: ‘It is illegal for the plumber but it is pretty implicit in these circumstances that there is a reason why there is a discount for cash. That is a large part of the hidden economy.’

The Treasury calculates that the tax gap in Britain - the difference between what is owed and what is collected - is about £35 billion each year.

Tax avoidance accounts for around £5 billion of the missing cash.

A European Union study earlier this 
year estimated the size of the black economy at £160 billion a year, 
more than 10 per cent of the entire economy and larger than the size of 
the deficit.

David Gauke has branded those who avoid tax as ‘morally’ questionable – but he is open to charges of hypocrisy.

In
 2006/7, Mr Gauke used his parliamentary expenses to ensure that 
taxpayers bore the cost of his stamp duty payments when he moved house.

He
 claimed £10,248.32 in ‘mortgaged payments’ on his second home that 
year. That broke down as ‘Inland Revenue Stamp Duty’ of £8,550.

The rest was accumulated solicitors’ fees, land registry and property searches.

He was later cleared of any wrongdoing and has not had to pay any of the money back.

HMRC have 
launched a series of tax campaigns over the past year, raising more than
 £500m, by persuading people from different sectors of business to 
encourage them to come forward and pay any tax they may not have 
declared.

These campaigns have included ones focusing on plumbers and electricians.

A
 campaign on trades more generally, including home repair, maintenance 
and improvement, will follow at the end of this year or early next year.

There
 is no law against paying someone in cash or asking to be paid in cash 
but traders can use cash payments to avoid declaring all their income or
 by dodging VAT.

But Treasury officials say customers should be ‘good citizens’ by not accepting cash work without a receipt.

Labour MP John Mann, a member of the 
Treasury Select Committee accused the Treasury of operating ‘double 
standards’ by threatening ordinary people who pay for jobs in cash while
 failing to get to grips with widespread corporate tax avoidance.

‘Everyone should be paying their fair share in taxes but this could end up being ridiculous.

‘It
 would be ridiculous if a pensioner paying a fiver cash in hand to 
someone to prune their roses was put through the tax system.

‘At
 the same time there are huge numbers of rich people and major companies
 who are not paying anything like the tax they should be doing. It’s 
double standards.’

Mr Gauke published a consultation 
document yesterday spelling out ways to crack down on cowboy accountants
 who run rogue tax avoidance schemes.

In future, they will have to give up their client lists and will remain liable even if they close the schemes or move companies.

The
 announcement came after comedian Jimmy Carr admitted to making a 
“terrible error of judgment” when it emerged he used a complex scheme to
 reduce his tax bill.

The K2 tax-avoidance scheme Carr is said to have used enables members to pay income tax rates as low as 1 per cent.

Mr
 Gauke said: ‘These schemes damage our ability to fund public services 
and provide support to those who need it. They undermine the actions of 
the vast majority of taxpayers, who pay more in tax as a consequence of 
others enjoying a free ride.

Union leaders said the Government would be better off closing the loopholes used by avoidance schemes.

Brendan
 Barber, TUC general secretary, said: ‘Successive governments have run 
shy of reforms to ensure the very wealthiest pay their fair share of 
tax.

‘But with countries around the world 
under pressure to reduce deficits, fair tax is an economic necessity.’ 
The TaxPayers’ Alliance said ministers needed to concentrate on 
reforming the complex tax system.

Matthew Sinclair, director of the TPA,
 said: ‘The Government is right to act to ensure that everyone pays 
their fair share of tax, but new powers to uncover specific abuses are a
 poor substitute for serious reform of the tax system so that there are 
fewer loopholes.

‘Ministers 
need to be more realistic about HMRC’s ability to clamp down when its 
resources are so stretched simply administering our hideously 
complicated taxes, let alone chasing those finding creative and legally 
dubious ways around them.

‘With a better tax system, HMRC staff can focus their attention on tackling those who are abusing the system. Proper reforms can ensure that everyone pays no more, and no less, than their fair share.’
