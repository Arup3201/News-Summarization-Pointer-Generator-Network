For many women, a gay best friend is the ultimate accessory and now scientists have revealed the reason most females crave one.

According to the research women want the friendship of a gay man because they offer them honest relationship advice, which they trust more than advice from straight friends because it's seen as unbiased counsel.

According to a new study published in the Evolutionary Psychology journal girls can rely on gay men because they have no sexual interest in them, while their straight female friends can't be trusted as they are viewed as competition.

Eric Russell, lead author of the study, from the University of Texas at Austin, said: 'Friendships between straight women and gay men are free of hidden mating agendas.

'They may be able to develop a deeper level of honesty because their relationship isn't complicated by sexual attraction or mating competition.'

Students at Texas Christian University were asked to look at a identical Facebook profile to judge how much they would trust the person's dating advice if they were at a party.

The profile was the same for each participant except the gender and sexual orientation were changed for different participants.

The study found that straight women deemed the advice of gay men to be more trustworthy than the same counsel offered by straight men and women.

Equally, gay men trusted the advice of straight women above gay men and women.

Mr Russell said: 'Women may have conflicts of interests with other women and straight men.

'Other women are potential competitors, and straight men may discourage relationships with other men and steer women toward themselves.

'Gay men, however, don't have these conflicts with straight women, so they may be uniquely positioned to provide mating-relevant advice and support that is not tainted with ulterior motives from sexual rivalry or sexual attraction.'

Famous female celebrities who have close friendship with gay men include Victoria Beckham, Katie Price, Sienna Miller and Kate Moss.
