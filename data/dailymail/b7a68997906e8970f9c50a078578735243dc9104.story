One in 10 Ukip supporters say they will not switch their vote at the election in order to keep Ed Miliband out

Just one in 10 Ukip supporters would consider switching their vote to keep Ed Miliband out of Downing Street, a major new poll revealed yesterday.

The study by the former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft found that most supporters of the anti-EU party do not believe to David Cameron's warning that they risk wrecking hopes of an EU referendum by aiding a Labour victory.

The finding is a major blow to the Tories who fear a strong showing for Ukip in next year's General Election could cost them dozens of seats.

The Tories 'Vote Ukip, get Labour' - or 'Vote Farage, get Miliband' slogan is expected to play a key role in the party's strategy next year.

But the new study of 2,300 Ukip supporters found that that just over half (51 per cent) disagreed with the statement 'a vote for Ukip makes the prospect of Ed Miliband becoming Prime Minister more likely'.

Almost a quarter (23 per cent) agreed they might inadvertently help Labour into power but said they did not care.

Just 10 per cent said they would consider changing their vote to keep Mr Miliband out.

The figure was slightly higher among voters who had defected from the Tories in the first place, with 14 per cent saying they would consider switching back next year.

Lord Ashcroft said the results showed that the Tory message needs 'spelling out' to voters who may spend little time thinking about the intricacies of the British electoral system.

He said the Tories needed to learn the lessons of the last election when they faced a similar challenge in trying to persuade voters that a vote for the Liberal Democrats was likely to result in a hung Parliament.

He said: 'Again, it seemed so obvious as hardly to need stating that the more Tories there were in the House of Commons, the greater the chance of a new administration.

'But this message was harder to get across than you might think.'

Lord Ashcroft insisted that the poll findings were not a disaster for the Conservatives, adding: 'If one in seven Tory-Ukip defectors might be persuaded to reconsider on the spot by this argument, that is not a failure.

'With marginal voters in marginal seats, the margins matter.'

The news will be a boost to Ukip leader Nigel Farage (left) and troubling to David Cameron (right) as the mantra 'Vote Ukip, get Labour' is expected to be part of Tory election campaigning next year

But the findings are likely to dismay Tory strategists who fear they will be wiped out in a string of marginal seats unless they succeed in winning back a much higher proportion of voters who have defected to Ukip.

Tory High Command believes that Mr Miliband's recent decision to all-but rule out an In/Out referendum on Europe has strengthened their anti-Ukip message by making it clear that only the Conservatives will deliver a referendum.

But the new poll underlines the scale of the challenge facing the Conservatives.

The new study also looked at wider public attitudes to Europe, based on a poll of more than 20,000 people.

It found that Britain was split down the middle on the Europe question, with 41 per cent wanting to stay in and 41 per cent wanting to leave.

Almost one-fifth of voters (19 per cent) were classified as having a 'committed hostility' to Europe. This group of mainly older, white voters saw immigration as the most important issue facing Britain, ranking it even higher than the economy.

A larger group (27 per cent) were classified as discontented sceptics'. Almost 90 per cent said they believed the costs of EU membership outweigh the benefits.

A further quarter (26 per cent) were classed as 'relaxed status quo'. They tended to be younger voters with higher qualifications.

Their main concerns focused on jobs and the economy, with Europe the least important issue in their lives.

Another 12 per cent were classed as 'global progressives'. They were more likely to work in the public sector and twice as likely to vote Labour.

They valued the freedom to travel and trade. Almost a third said they saw no real drawbacks to EU membership.

A further 15 per cent were classified as 'disengaged'. This group comprised mainly young, working class women.

More than 80 per cent do not have a clear view on the costs and benefits of EU membership.
