The family of the eight-year-old boy killed in the Boston marathon bombings has revealed the heartbreaking moment their daughter awoke two weeks after the attack and learned her brother had died.

Seven-year-old Jane Richard lost her leg in the April 15 blast, while her mother Denise, 42, suffered head injuries, her father Bill, 42, was hit by shrapnel and her brother Martin lost his life.

Only her oldest brother, 12-year-old Henry, escaped without injury.

In a statement released on Thursday, the family revealed Jane awoke two weeks after the attack 'with difficult questions that
 needed to be answered'.

'There are not words to describe how hard 
sharing this heartbreaking news was on all of us,' it read.

Amid the tragedy, the family is celebrating the progress of little Jane, who has now undergone her eleventh surgery to close the wound on her left leg and to eventually prepare it for a prosthesis.

She has battled infections in hospital and faces more surgeries after losing her leg below the knee.

'While she has more trips to the O.R. 
ahead of her, last night's operation marked an important milestone,' the statement read. 'If things go well, Jane could be ready to transition to the rehabilitation stage of her recovery in the next few weeks.'

Bill is recovering from his shrapnel wound and is hopeful that he will regain hearing he lost from the blast, while Denise is recovering from her surgeries, but is still missing sight in one eye.

Henry has returned to school, 'which gives him a needed sense of routine and normalcy', the statement, which was uploaded to the family's website, said.

The Richards also took the time to thank members of the public and authorities for their help throughout 'our very darkest hour'.

'We want to thank the people who quickly got to Jane and addressed her injury in the street because they saved her life,' it read. 'We also salute those who stood guard over Martin’s body so he was not alone. Those officers will never know how comforting that was in our very darkest hour.'

Jane Richard is believed to have been standing on the marathon fence next to the big brother she idolized when the first of two bombs detonated near to the finish line.

them.

Bill and Jane's eldest brother Henry, 12, managed to escape from the bomb attack uninjured.

It isn't clear whether any of the women 
in the photograph is the children's mother, school librarian Denise, 43,
 who sustained head injuries and had to undergo brain surgery following 
the attack.

Jane is an enthusiastic Irish dancer having attended classes at the Clifden Academy of Irish Dance in Milton since the age of three, local reports noted.

Neighbors said Jane looked up to her older brother and they both attended the Neighborhood House Charter School in Dorchester, where their mother served as the school librarian.

Tracey Monroe, a bystander who came to Jane's aid in the moments after the blast, told WCVB.com: 'I saw her laying in the street. I held her head in my hands and I tried to rub her and comfort her. I asked what her name was and she said Jane.

'She was just a baby and so badly injured and scared. But she was so incredibly brave. I saw him [Martin] and at that point I knew he was gone. I'll never forget them - that little girl, she was so brave.'

The bombs, described by experts as makeshift anti-personnel devices, were made from pressure cookers packed with shrapnel and ball bearings to cause the maximum injuries to bystanders.

Police believe they were planted by brothers Dzhokhar, 19, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26. After their images were released by the FBI, Tamerlan was killed in an ensuing gunfight with police.

His younger brother was found hiding in a boat outside a home hours later and was treated in hospital for an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the neck. He remains in federal prison in Massachusetts and is charged with using a weapon of mass destruction.
