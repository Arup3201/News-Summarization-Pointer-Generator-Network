The spurned ex of a 31-year-old woman picked her up at the airport and fatally shot her several times on the drive home, police said.

Jamie Kimble was picked up from the Tampa International Airport last Sunday by on-again, off-again boyfriend Luis Roberson Rodriguez, 39, but the two soon began arguing.

Witnesses watched in horror as she jumped out of the car and he fired several bullets into her. She had apparently been visiting a new boyfriend in London.

Violent end: Police are treating the investigation as a murder-suicide

Police told the Tampa Bay Times that Ms Kimble was flying back from London, where she was visiting a new boyfriend.

Rodriguez met her at the airport and gave her a ride.

But around 7:38pm Sunday night, witnesses said they saw him punching her repeatedly.

They told authorities that Ms Kimble leapt out of the car around Cypress Street and Westshore Boulevard to try and escape him.

Officials said that the suspect then pulled out a handgun, first firing a shot into the air, and then shooting several at Ms Kimble.

After he shot her, police said the Orlando resident made a U-turn and shot himself twice in the head.Â 

Ms Kimble died at the scene, and Rodriguez died in hospital.

Neither families of the suspect or victim responded to request for comment.

Police are continuing their investigation.
