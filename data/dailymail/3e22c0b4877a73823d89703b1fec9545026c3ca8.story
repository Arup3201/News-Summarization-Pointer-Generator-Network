Forget the swans, this year babies are a-swimming.

Infants just a few months old have been photographed diving underwater in their Christmas outfits. With no armbands in sight, they grin for the camera and swim unaided towards their festive toys.

The adorable pictures have been produced for the holiday season by a swimming school for infants.

While some of the children seem far too young to be diving, their instructors say it is good for babies to swim from birth so they are not scared of the water.

Among the gorgeous models is Olivia Parry, who is seen at just a few months old in her red and white outfit and Santa hat, which is touching the water’s surface.

Her big beautiful eyes gazing at the camera, she is perfectly calm gliding under water.

Osian Kerton, meanwhile, makes a plunge in his green elf costume, with a red and green ‘Santa’s little helper’ hat and Alex and William Steward and their friend Beau West beam as the three kings in their gold crowns.

Siblings Erin and Oakley Nicholson also posed in their Christmas hats, with Erin sticking her tongue out for the camera, clearly delighted to be in the pool.

Alisha and Sophia Sunthareswaran laughed as they posed with a doll as Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus.

Barney Burns, however, looked slightly alarmed in his bright red reindeer antlers and Alice Knight appeared to need a bit more encouragement, diving towards her snowman teddy.

The photographs were produced by Water Babies, a British baby and toddler swim school, which teaches more than 41,000 babies a week learn to swim at franchises across the UK and Ireland.

The shoot was overseen by specially trained ‘dipographers’, who are experts in watching and interpreting babies’ body language and expressions to make sure they are completely happy in the water.

Water Babies encourages parents to take their children swimming from birth – because, they say, it is good for bonding, teaches babies not to be frightened of water and is great exercise.

Babies instinctively hold their breath when submerged and can move freely in water supporting their weight. But they do not have the strength to swim to the surface.

Since Water Babies started in 2002, its research has found that babies who participate show improved patterns of eating and sleeping.

The instructors also claim swimming promotes bonding between babies and their parents.

Co-founder Paul Thompson said: ‘Swimming with your baby is an unforgettable experience for both parent and child, allowing you some special one on one time to focus on each other.

‘Studies have shown that participating babies have improved sleeping and eating patterns, thanks to the hidden physical workout received during the gentle class.’

The company, which has teamed up with Manchester University to examine the effects of baby swimming classes on children, parents and the family unit, said their students have saved their own lives because of their lessons.

In the lessons, the infants learn how to kick to the surface, swim to and hold on to the nearest solid object and, where possible, how to climb out of water.

At least ten of the children, they claim, have used their skills to get out of life-threatening difficulty. Five of them were just two at the time.

Water Babies’s research also shows 75 per cent of parents do not know that drowning is the third highest cause of accidental death of children in the UK – and the average child at the moment only learns to swim when they are four years old.

The instructors said most children panic when they find themselves suddenly in water, caused by the shock of not being familiar with swimming.

‘In most cases, it’s the shock of sudden submersion that causes children to panic. We passionately believe that by introducing babies to water as early as possible, they’ll be less likely to experience fear if they do fall in,’ Mr Thompson added.

Water Babies’s youngest student to enrol is Phoenix Charles Elwell, who was just one day old when he was first taken swimming by his parents.

The newborn was taken swimming by his father Simon, 30, in the hydrotherapy pool at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon.

Mr Elwell, a Water Babies instructor who is married to Rebecca, 33, and also has a two year old daughter Alyana, said of his baby son: ‘He absolutely loved his time in the pool. I think he would quite happily have gone to sleep in the water when we finished. It was quite special for me too.’
