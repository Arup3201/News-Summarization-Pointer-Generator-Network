Jailed: Middle class robber Diallo Allen who burgled a house just three days after being spared jail for carrying out three muggings has now been sent to prison

A middle class robber who burgled a house just three days after being spared jail for carrying out three muggings has now been sent to prison.

Diallo Allen was allowed to walk free by Judge Lesley Newton despite carrying out three muggings after she heard he turned to crime when his family fell on hard times.

The judge instead gave Allen a 15 month sentence suspended for two years.

But just three days later he smashed his way into a house in Chorlton, Manchester.

Police found traces of 18-year-old Allen's blood at the scene.  Today, his suspended sentence was revoked at Manchester Crown Court.

Allen, from Chorlton, was sentenced to a further two months in a young offenders institute - meaning he will now be locked up for 17 months.

Diallo had previously appeared in court on January 23, where he was sentenced for stealing an iPhone, Blackberry and bag worth £800 from three teenagers in Chorlton.

At that hearing, Judge Newton was told he had fallen with a bad crowd when financial difficulties meant his family had to move to the Nell Lane estate, 1.5 miles away, and took pity on him.

At his original hearing the court was told how Allen's mother, Deanne Blake, was a social worker who worked for Manchester council for 18 years before launching her own private consultancy.

His dad Garfield Allen, who is separated from Ms Blake, was a respected theatre director at the Green Room in Manchester before he was made redundant due to funding cuts in the arts.

Det Con Rob Southern said: 'When he was sentenced for the robberies, much was made in the media about his change in personal circumstances.

'It was argued that the offending coincided with him moving to the Nell Lane estate area but that argument is insulting to the residents there.

'Allen and Allen alone took the decision to rob three people and after being given a second chance took a decision to break into a house just a couple of days later.'

After the case was reported, 
19-year-old Manchester United reserves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone revealed
one of the victims was his girlfriend Byrony Turner - describing the 
sentence as 'a joke'.

Johnstone tweeted: ‘What a joke!! The 
guy who mugged my gf while I was in China on tour let off. That bag and 
purse was expensive!’

From the old: Allen used to live with his parents on the upmarket Stratton Road in Chorlton, Greater Manchester, which has an average price of £210,000, before the recession forced them out

To the new: Financial difficulties meant Allen's family had to move 1.5 miles away to Ploughbank Drive on the Nell Lane estate, which has an average house price of £100,000

Miss Turner also took to the social 
networking site, saying: ‘Ridiculous excuse in my eyes after what he put
me through. These people need to be off the streets.’

Local councillor Norman Lewis condemned the judge’s decision to spare Allen jail, saying that he should have been made to take responsibility for his criminal actions.

‘People’s homes are their own Shangri-Las and it’s unacceptable to come home to find that somebody has been through their property,’ he said.

‘The judge needs to reflect on her decision to suspend the sentence.’

Days after, Allen went through a property looking for things to steal but found nothing to take, Manchester Magistrates’ Court (left) heard

Before the change in their fortunes 
Allen had enjoyed an ‘affluent, middle-class lifestyle’ living on a road
where the average house price is around £200,000.

But in 2010, he was forced to move to the Nell Lane estate, where the average house costs around £100,000.

Sentencing him for the mugging, Judge 
Newton said: ‘If I send you to prison I fear your life will spiral 
downwards – I have persuaded myself it’s not appropriate to send you to 
prison.’
