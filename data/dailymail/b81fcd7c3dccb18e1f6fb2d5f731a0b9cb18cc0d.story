Three Aston Villa football players have been fined and disciplined after mobile phone footage emerged of them involved in a nightclub brawl – just days before their team’s most important game of the season.

The Premier League club, which is struggling to avoid relegation, took action against Chris Herd, 23, James Collins, 28, and Fabian Delph, 22, following the incident outside Birmingham city centre’s Gatecrasher club at 2.45am on Tuesday.

Video footage shows a tattooed Herd kicking the club’s glass doors in a confrontation with staff.

Collins and Delph can also be seen launching a tirade of expletives during the melee.

Another man is filmed holding the three footballers back near the end of the 52-second clip.

All
three members of the first team have issued statements apologising for 
their behaviour and police have confirmed they are not investigating the
incident which happened only five days before the clash with Tottenham.

The club have fined them with the proceeds going to charity.

The trouble flared only hours after Villa’s player of the year awards, held at Villa Park’s Holte Suite on Monday.

It is understood none of the players had been drinking alcohol during the ceremony.

An
Aston Villa statement said: ‘The Club dealt with this matter internally
on Tuesday and the players in question have been disciplined, with the 
fines being split between two charities the club are promoting at the 
game against Spurs on Sunday - Cure Leukaemia and Anthony Nolan.

‘Our
players attended the club’s end-of-season dinner on Monday night and 
training on Tuesday was limited to players who did not start in 
Saturday’s Premier League game against West Bromwich Albion and those 
not carrying injuries.

‘As a club, players, management and fans are completely focused on Sunday’s game against Spurs at Villa Park.’

Wales international James Colins said: ‘I’m sorry for what has happened and I take responsibility for my actions.

‘It
does not show me in a very good light and does not put the club in a 
very good light. I know I should not have been out in a club with my 
wife after the end-of-season dinner at that time in the morning and I 
was wrong to be in that position.

‘It was a misunderstanding and was resolved quickly but I understand how it looks and I apologise for that.

‘As a senior, experienced player, I understand I am in a position of responsibility.

‘I
let myself get into a position in which I didn’t act responsibly and I 
apologise for this. It was Monday night, it was early in the week, six 
days before we next play and I didn’t have training the next day.

‘But
I know I’ve let myself down, I’ve let the club down, I’ve let the 
manager down and most of all I’ve let down the fans of Aston Villa who 
have been great to me.

‘We 
have a very important game of football on Sunday at Villa Park against 
Tottenham and I’m looking forward to giving my full commitment, as 
always, and securing three points.’

Chris
Herd said: I would like to apologise for what happened on Monday night 
and I apologise for being out at that time. My actions on the night were
out of character.

Even if I
felt at the time that the prior situation inside the nightclub had not 
been dealt with properly, it was no one's intention to be involved in 
any trouble. In fact, we were accompanied by our girlfriends and wives.

But
I should not have acted in the manner in which I did. I’ll do 
everything I can to make it up to the club and the fans, as they have 
both been fantastic since I’ve joined the team. My immediate aim is to 
help the team to finish the season strongly and to secure our position 
in the Premier League.

Former
England Under-21 international Fabian Delph said: ‘I’m sorry for being 
out on Monday night, the early hours of Tuesday morning and I apologise 
to the club, the fans, the chairman, the manager and my colleagues.

‘I am injured, I won’t be fit again until pre-season and I probably thought that going out would not carry any consequences.

‘I was sober, I was in control of my actions and I did try to calm down the situation.

‘I didn’t hit out or strike anyone but I should not have been there and I was wrong to be in this position.’
