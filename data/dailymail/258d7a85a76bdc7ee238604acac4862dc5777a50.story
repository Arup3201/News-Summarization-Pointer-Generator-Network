These close up shots of a pair of nesting barn owls happily posing together on a wooden fence-post were captured by a quick-witted wildlife photographer.

Robert Fuller, 42, started feeding the  birds, who are typically shy animals, after they nested near his home in the Yorkshire Wolds and gradually crew more accustomed to his lens.

He set up a GoPro camera in front of the post and was able to lure them up-close with food - snapping the love birds in action as the male barn owl showed off his impressive wings.

The images were captured by wildlife photographer Robert Fuller, who noticed them nesting near his home

After a dismal breeding season for barn owls last year, when Mr Fuller spotted the birds nesting near his home in Thixendale, North Yorkshire, he left out a meal of mice and chicks every evening.

Once they grew used to his presence they would follow him down the valley to the wooden post - and the male would even land on his head a few times. 

Mr Fuller, who had to get a special licence to take the photos, believes the trust they developed allowed him to stay close and capture these images.

He also recorded footage of the pair using the powerful action camera, which was less than two feet from the feeding post.

He said: 'Last year was the worst barn owl breeding year on record in the whole of England. So at the end of the breeding season I set about feeding a particular pair near me.

'I started off feeding them mice then chicks every night and they eventually became so accustomed to me that they would follow me down the valley when they saw me coming.

'Barn owls are naturally quite wary of people so it surprised me but they became quite used to me, especially the male.

The male owl, pictured tucking into one of Mr Fuller's meals, even landed on his head as they made their way to the area to have their picture taken in the Yorkshire valleys

Barn owls had a dismal breeding season last year and Mr Fuller wanted to do what he could to help them out

'I watched them over a period of months and gradually knew what they would do and how I could best capture them in action but it does look as if they are posing for the pictures.'

His efforts not only reaped the rewards for his photography, the feeding also helped ensure the birds were well enough to have two broods, eight chicks in total, that all fledged and left the nest.

And now the chicks have started coming back to the feeding post too.
