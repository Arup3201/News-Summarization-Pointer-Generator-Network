A cruel religious sect kept 27 children locked away in dark and unheated underground cells - some for a decade.

The youngsters, aged from one to 17, have never seen daylight and have now been rescued from their living hell in Russia.

They were kept in an eight-level warren of cramped rooms underneath a three-storey house, without ventilation or electricity in a suburb of the city of Kazan, in the eastern region of Tartarstan.

Child cruelty: Children aged between one and 17 were found in the bunker - some of whom have never seen sunlight

The children’s parents have been 
charged with child abuse and the elderly leader of the Muslim sect, 
83-year-old Faizrakhman Satarov, faces charges of negligence. 

Members of the sect call themselves 'muammin' after the Arabic term that means 'believers'.

Self-declared prophet Satarov, a 
former top imam in a neighbouring province, had declared the derelict 
house an independent Islamic state.

He ordered 70 followers to live in
the underground cells and only a few sect members were allowed to leave
the premises to work as traders at a local market.

The children are now in hospital and will go on to be placed temporarily in an orphanage.

Tatarstan police have said that 
the house will be demolished - but Satarov’s deputy Gumer Ganiyev 
declared on local television that it would be destroyed ‘over our dead 
bodies’. None of those charged have been arrested.

'They will come with bulldozers and guns, but they can demolish this house over our dead bodies!' he said.

Satarov has followers in several other cities in largely-Muslim Tatarstan and other Volga River provinces.

He has said that he founded the 
sect after falling out with other clerics and authorities in the 
Communist era, when the KGB sent him to Muslim nations to spread stories
about religious freedom in the officially atheist Soviet Union.

Government-approved Orthodox Christian, Muslim and Jewish clerics routinely travelled abroad on Soviet publicity trips.

Angry: Members of the sect shout at media assembled by the bunker

'That’s how I became Satan’s 
servant, a traitor,' he was quoted as saying. “When I understood that, I
repented and started preaching.'

Muslim leaders in Tatarstan said Satarov’s views were contrary to their own.

Kazan-based theologian Rais 
Suleimanov said: 'The teachings of Satarov, who declared himself a 
prophet, have been rejected by traditional Muslims.'

He added that the sect, which had stopped accepting new members, were 'only dangerous to themselves and their children'.

The underground cells were 
discovered by police on Friday as part of an ongoing investigation into 
the killing of a local Muslim leader who had been critical of radical 
Islamist groups.

Building site: Boxes and crates are stacked up around the entrance of the bunker

Kazan: The city, with a population of 1.5million, has been shocked by claims that a sect has been keeping children underground for up to ten years

Religious harmony: The Kul Sharif Mosque in Kazan, left, and a catholic 
church nearby is an example of how Muslims and Christians co-exist in 
the city
