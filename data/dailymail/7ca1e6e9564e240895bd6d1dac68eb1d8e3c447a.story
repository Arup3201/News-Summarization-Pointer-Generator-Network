Rail passengers on Britain’s busiest commuter routes have delivered a damning verdict on their late, overcrowded and expensive services.

Fewer than a third (30per cent) of travellers with the Southeastern train company considered the price of their ticket was good or satisfactory, according to a major survey by rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus.

And passengers on Southeastern’s Kent to London Metro services, the value-for-money figure was just 29per cent - the lowest of any route in the survey of 27,000 passengers.

Overall nearly half, 45per cent, of Southeastern's passengers considered their ticket either poor or unsatisfactory in terms of value - the highest dissatisfaction level among the UK train companies

Overall nearly half (45per cent) of Southeastern’s passengers considered their ticket either poor or unsatisfactory in terms of value - the highest dissatisfaction level among the UK train companies.

By contrast customers on the Yorkshire-to-London train company Grand Central rated their ticket the best value, with nearly eight out of ten (78per cent) judging it satisfactory or good and only 11per cent rating it poor or unsatisfactory.

Other low marks for the value for money of tickets were scored by Abellio Greater Anglia where just over a third (35per cent) reckoned their ticket offered good or satisfactory value, followed by South West Trains (37per cent good or satisfactory) , First Capital Connect (38per cent) and Southern (39per cent).

Across all train companies, the national figure for those reckoning their ticket offered good or satisfactory value for money was still under half (45per cent) -  a slight improvement on the 42% figure from a similar survey this time last year.

Passenger Focus said the rise was likely to be a reflection on the Government’s decision to cap annual season ticket rises at the level of inflation.

The Office of Rail Regulation said the results showed ‘inconsistent levels of service across the country’ with passengers enduring too great a variance in performance.

Southeastern had the lowest overall satisfaction level in the latest survey - at 72per cent - with First Hull Trains having the highest figure at  96per cent.

By individual route, the lowest customer satisfaction figure of 69per cent was for Southeastern’s mainline services. First Capital Connect’s Thameslink Loop services only scored 70per cent.

For overcrowding, fewer than six out of ten (56per cent) of Southeastern’s passengers gave a rating of satisfied or good for sufficient room to sit or stand. This was the lowest figure overall and compared dismally with highest-rated Grand Central at 93per cent.

Overall passenger satisfaction was 82per cent - the same as a year ago - and figures for satisfaction and punctuality also remained steady at 77per cent

Overall passenger satisfaction level in the latest survey was 82per cent - the same as a year ago.

Satisfaction with punctuality and reliability also remained similar to 2013 at 77per cent.

Southeastern said the survey had taken place at a time when its services were hit by bad weather.

The company’s managing director Charles Horton said: ‘We’re not surprised that our customers have responded to the survey in this way as we too were frustrated by the problems that hampered services over the winter.’

But Passenger Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: ‘Getting trains on time is the key factor underpinning passenger satisfaction while how delays are dealt with is the key factor behind scores for passengers’ dissatisfaction.

‘Better communications during weather-related disruptions may have ensured passengers’ satisfaction in dealing with delays has held up with some train companies.’

East Coast, which has been run in the public sector since 2009 but is to be sold back to  a private operator in November, had an overall customer satisfaction level of 91per cent - one of the best nationally.

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: 'This is another vote of confidence in our only public-run rail franchise. Passengers have voted it the best service, just a year after the Office of Rail Regulation confirmed it was also the best value for taxpayers.’

Michael Roberts, director general of industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said: ‘Passengers are at the heart of what we do and the rail industry knows it must keep on getting better, driving up the quality of services to respond to customers’ needs.'

Office of Rail Regulation chairman Anna Walker said: 'This survey is an excellent barometer of what matters to those at the heart of the railways - its passengers.'

She added: ‘The results reinforce our decision to bring in tough new performance targets for the railways to reduce the disparity in punctuality between different routes and train services.’

Southeastern is run by Govia which is majority-owned by the Go-Ahead transport company.

Last month the Government announced that a Govia Thameslink joint venture had won the battle to run a new mega-franchise - the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern (TSGN) franchise - which will operate for seven years from this September.

Rail Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘While satisfaction remains high, passengers are demanding more trains, better connections and better customer service.

‘Over the next five years, we are spending more than £38 billion to maintain and improve the railways to meet these challenges, but train operators need to recognise that, while they have done good things, they need to do more.’
