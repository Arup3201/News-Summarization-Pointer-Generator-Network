Ban? Supplies of orange juice could be in danger as the EU is considering a ban on South African citrus imports, it has been suggested today

The price of orange juice on  Britain’s breakfast tables could rise next summer if the EU goes ahead with a ban on South African citrus imports.

The move follows the interception of 35 citrus shipments this year from the chief summer supplier to Europe that were contaminated with fungal black spot disease.

With growers in southern Europe fearing it could take hold in their citrus groves, the European  Commission is drawing up plans for a ban that could be adopted by the end of November.

EU trade chief Karel De Gucht told
South African officials during a visit to Johannesburg this week that 
the contaminated shipments were 'serious and problematic' and that a 
response was needed.

South Africa exports about 600,000 tons of citrus fruit – mainly oranges, lemons, limes and tangerines – to the EU each year and the industry is worth 1 billion euros.

It is the main source of orange juice drunk in Britain, Germany and France during the summer months.

For now the planned citrus ban would be largely symbolic, as it would apply only to this year’s South African harvest, which ended in October, meaning EU imports have already stopped.

But the EU's food safety watchdog is 
currently analysing the situation and if studies show the disease has a 
risk of taking hold in Europe's estimated 500,000 hectares of citrus 
groves, the ban could be extended.

While harmless to humans, citrus black spot causes unsightly lesions on the fruit and leaves of affected plants, reducing both harvest quality and quantity.

There is no known cure, but  fungicides can be used to control the spread of the disease.

It is found in many citrus growing regions in the southern hemisphere, but has never established itself in Europe.

The dispute comes at as the EU seeks South Africa's support to unlock stalled trade deals with sub-Saharan Africa.

During
negotiations in South Africa this week, EU officials offered to improve
the terms of a bilateral free-trade deal dating from 1999 by granting 
South African sugar farmers duty-free access to Europe for the first 
time.

Citrus black
spot causes unsightly lesions on the fruit and the leaves of affected 
plants and therefore reduces both harvest quality and quantity.

There is no known cure, but fungicides can be used to control the spread of the disease.

It
is found in many citrus growing regions in the southern hemisphere as 
well as China and the United States, but has never established itself in
Europe.

Since 2011, the number of citrus shipments from South Africa found to contain black spot has averaged about 35 each year.

Following
calls by citrus growers in top EU producer Spain to take a tougher 
stance on the issue, the Commission said it would be forced take action 
if more than 5 contaminated shipments were intercepted from the country 
this year.

In its draft 
opinion published in July, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 
said the chance of citrus black spot taking in hold in Europe was 'moderately likely'.

However, it it added there was a high level of uncertainty due to a lack of knowledge over how the disease would respond to the EU climate.

The
EFSA is due to finalise its assessment by the end of the year.

EU farm union Copa-Cogeca said if the 
planned ban was confirmed it would be a step in the right direction. It 
also urged the Commission to impose restrictions on next year's South 
African citrus harvest.

'What we need is measures for 2014 
before imports start again in March,' Copa-Cogeca Secretary General 
Pekka Pesonen said in a statement.

The
head of the South African Citrus Growers' Association, Justin Chadwick,
said any type of ban by the EU would be 'most unfortunate'.

'Global experts have confirmed that citrus black spot is not a risk (to Europe), so a ban would seem unnecessary,' he said.

Since 2011, the number of citrus shipments from South Africa found to contain black spot has averaged about 35 each year.

Following calls by citrus growers in top EU producer Spain to take a tougher stance on the issue, the Commission said it would be forced take action if more than 5 contaminated shipments were intercepted from the country this year.

In its draft opinion published in July, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said the chance of citrus black spot taking in hold in Europe was 'moderately likely'.

However, it it added there was a high level of uncertainty due to a lack of knowledge over how the disease would respond to the EU climate.

The EFSA is due to finalise its assessment by the end of the year, and its findings will largely determine what further moves, if any, the Commission will take to restrict South African imports.

But a group of citrus black spot experts from countries affected by the disease said it had identified 'factual errors and omissions' in EFSA's draft assessment, and that there was no recorded case of the disease ever having spread via fruit exports.
