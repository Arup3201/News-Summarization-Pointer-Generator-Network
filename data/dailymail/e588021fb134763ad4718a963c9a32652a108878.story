Six years ago Dave Tomkins found himself watching a situation we all dread, as his beloved grandpa who could no longer live alone, moved into a retirement home.

While helping to pack up his home, he uncovered a box full of extraordinary photos his grandfather Stephen Clarke had taken throughout his life.  

Dave, who is originally from Sydney, took the images to show his grandfather, but sadly he could not remember much about them or where they were taken. What made the discovery more interesting was that his grandfather had never mentioned his passion for photography, or many of his trips abroad.

'I was hoping to make him a book or something. Something to give him more to talk about, more to think about in that home other than catheter bags and test results. It worked for a while but he never really believed that the photos were that good. He thought I was just being nice.'

From that moment Dave's project began; he knew he had to show his beloved grandpa how good the photos were, and help him remember the stories behind them.  Eager to find out more about the photos and make his grandpa believe in his talent, he decided to reach out to the world for help.

The 34-year-old art director, who has worked at Mother advertising agency in New York, used his creative side to put together a website.  While he could recognise some of the locations instantly, including his Grandpa's stunning shot of the New York skyline, a few of the photos were harder to place.

He called on the public to help him narrow down and locate the whereabouts of the images, and his idea proved to be an overwhelming success. Thousands of people flocked to help him discover where the photos were taken, helping Dave piece his grandfather's history together.

With the help of hundreds of responses on the website, he was able to track down most of the photos locations. The striking photos were taken in Barcelona, Venice, Lisbon, Australia and all over Switzerland.

Taken in the San Paulo area, Venice, Italy - the Ristorante Pilsen is now a Hard Rock Cafe

New York's JFK Airport. The Eero Saarinen building. 'Taken from a pedestrian walkway. Many people on Grandpa's Photos helped find this one,' Dave said

Dave is not too sure where this photo was taken but the best guess on grandpasphotos.com is Piazza Cisterna in San Gimignano, Italy. He's hoping to find this one on his trip

Not long after Dave moved to New York after that to chase 'the big job' as an Art Director in Advertising.

'I had been talking about Grandpa's photos for way too long and one of the agencies I worked at even put them into an exhibition. I was able to go home and tell Grandpa he was in an 'Exhibition in New York City'. (That's a really big deal in Australia).

'That blew his mind. Everyone within a 5 mile radius (his scooter range) of the nursing home knew all about it. It was working, he wasn't talking about urinary tract infections and how bleak the home was.'

He says some of his favourite photos include one of his grandmother relaxing on the beach in Australia, and another where his grandfather is head of the table enjoying a meal with family.

'Most of the family ones are great to me as I get to see family in scenarios I've never seen them in. Happy smiling shots of youth, bright colours and always happy times. Not one single hospital bed, waiting room or nursing home'

Also the one where my Dad is in the photos it's pretty obvious he was around at the Family in-laws for dinner. They got divorced when I was 2 so these are weird and funny and my Dad looks hilarious.'

'This was taken in Zurich, Switzerland. Probably taken out of a cab driving over a short bridge called the Landesmuseum. The bridge in the photo is called 'Bahnhofbr¸cke'- I had no idea where this was until putting up the site,' Dave said

'Not sure where this was taken. Seems to be that Grandpa travelled down overland from Interlaken to northern Italy. It has been suggested that this is possibly The Piemont not far from the alps,' Dave says

Catch of the day: Dave thinks this photograph was probably taken on a fishing trip that his Grandfather was on more than likely off the coast of Brisbane in Australia

Sadly his Grandfather has since passed away, but Dave is determined to keep his memory alive through celebrating his photos.

He explains that the striking photographs are not only a way to keep Stephen' memory alive, but also an insight into parts of his life he never knew.

The art director who has been living in New York for the last four years, recently decided to pack up his bags and head home to Australia wanting to be closer to family.

However he thought of a much more interesting and scenic route home. Instead of paying an extravagant airfare to fly straight to Australia, the creative thinker decided to get a much more reasonably priced flight to Stockholm.

After Stockholm Dave is headed to Dublin to see family and not one to miss out on an opportunity, he is going to visit all of the places where his beloved grandfather took his photos.

'I think the next generation will have a different experience because we take photos of everything. Most people in 20 years will be able to see what their parents ate on any given Tuesday, in-between lunch and dinner.'

'I'm not sure how it will be. But it's great to think that photos I take on this trip will be around for my future kids to see and especially for my Mum, Grandpa's Daughter now.'

'The aim is to get as many people as possible to appreciate Grandpa's Photos even if he isn't here anymore. Somehow it almost feels like he is alive for a tiny bit longer. I know that sounds weird but talking about him so much and looking at his photos is somehow like having him around. Maybe just not forgetting him I guess.'

'This is my Grandma, June Clarke on the beach. Probably in Brisbane, Australia. I can't work out what she's reading. Such a great shot, typical of Australian life in Summer,' Dave says

Dave is not 100 per cent sure where this was taken but he guesses it is in Switzerland and it has been suggested on the website that it is somewhere along the Axenstrasse - a river in Switzerland

Numerous people from thee website are quite certain this was taken in an alley way in Florence, Italy
