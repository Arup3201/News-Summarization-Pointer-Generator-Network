Five people are dead and several others injured after a gunman went berserk at a wood processing plant in Switzerland today.

The gunman committed suicide at the scene, confirmed police, as helicopters were scrambled to evacuate the wounded.

The shooting came just days after the Kronospan company said production had been reduced due to a massive timber shortage.

It was not immediately clear if the shooter was faced with the sack due to the downturn at the firm in Menzau, near Lucerne.

Police said the gunman opened fire in 
the company canteen. It is believed around 450 people work there.

'There are dead and there are wounded,' said Urs 
Wigger, the police spokesman for the local canton.

Three helicopters were brought in to 
ferry four seriously wounded survivors to two local hospitals after 
gunfire began at shortly after 9am.

First reports said that a total of seven people in all were injured.

'People were lining up for their breakfast when all hell broke loose,' one man told a local radio station.

Another told a local newspaper: 'My son told me the guy just came in and opened fire and people fell like skittles.'

The canteen was visited later in the morning by the local council leader Adrain Duss who said: 'I am shocked and stunned.

'This is an incomprehensible act. How anyone could do it is beyond reason.'

It was not immediately clear what sort of weapon the gunman used.

The shooting came barely two months 
after a drug addict armed with three guns rampaged through a sleepy 
Swiss village on January 3, shooting dead three women and injuring 
several more people.

He was finally stopped in a shootout 
with police, wounded and raced to hospital. He is now awaiting trial on 
murder charges. Police say he had been drinking heavily in the village 
of Daillon, near the border with Italy and France, before embarking on 
his rampage.

Both shootings come amid a fierce debate in Switzerland about the easy access that citizens have to guns.

Men are allowed to keep their 
military weapons at home when not serving in the army and the law 
alliows for any citizen over 18 to easily obtain a weapon - whether a 
reservist or not.

Some two million weapons are in 
private hands in Switzerland while the authorities estimate there are 
some 240,000 unregistered firearms.
