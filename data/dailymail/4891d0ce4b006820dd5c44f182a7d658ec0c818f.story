Hundreds of pregnant women may have had healthy babies aborted after scanning blunders at a top hospital.

An investigation found that medics had been using a flawed procedure for scanning women who were at risk of losing their babies.

It is feared that many will have been wrongly told they had miscarried and given drugs to terminate the pregnancy.

Near miss: Emily Wheatley, 31, was wrongly told by staff that her daughter Ella, now eight monhts old, right, had died when she was nine weeks pregnant.

The ‘fundamental error’ in procedure goes back to 2006.

Midwives
investigating miscarriages are recommended to use an internal 
transvaginal scan which is more accurate than the external Doppler 
ultrasound procedure.

The 
scandal came to light after Emily Wheatley, 31, was told she had 
miscarried at nine weeks following investigations at the University 
Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

But
when she attended a different hospital for treatment with drugs to 
remove the foetus in July 2012, staff carried out a further scan which 
revealed a baby’s heartbeat. Miss Wheatley went on to give birth to a 
healthy baby but was ‘traumatised’ by the events.

Fears: In Ms Wheatley's case the error was spotted, and she gave birth to a healthy baby. But an investigation has raised fears that other women may not have been so lucky

Emily Wheatley yesterday spoke of her despair after being told by a midwife she could not detect a  heartbeat during her first scan.

Another midwife repeated the procedure at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff, but concluded she had suffered a silent miscarriage.

It was only when she went to Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny that another scan revealed she was still pregnant. Miss Wheatley, of Monmouth,  who is now mother to healthy eight-month-old  Ella was left ‘traumatised’.

She said: ‘When I saw the baby clearly on the screen, I couldn’t really believe that the University Hospital of Wales had got it wrong. I feel angry at the decision to not follow a simple process which could have prevented this misdiagnosis.’

Miss Wheatley, who suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome, added: ‘It’s just unbelievable that there are potentially other women out there who have been diagnosed with having a silent miscarriage. And they potentially have got rid of healthy babies –  that frightens me.

‘Maybe hundreds of babies have been lost because of their decision.’

The
investigation found UHW staff were ‘systematically failing’ to perform 
the correct scans on women with suspected early pregnancy loss.

A
damning report from Peter Tyndall, the Public Services Ombudsman for 
Wales, says well-established clinical guidance was ignored for seven  
years. The findings will be ‘extremely disturbing’ for women who have 
had terminations in that time, he said.

A
spokesman for the Royal College of Gynaecologists,  who issued the 
guidelines, yesterday said  almost every unit in England was signed up  
and adhering to the recommended procedure.

Mr
Tyndall has asked the Welsh Government to check that all health boards 
are now complying with the guidance.

A helpline received 28 calls 
yesterday, of which eight women were ‘immediately reassured’.

Failings
were discovered after  a complaint by Miss Wheatley’s mother about her 
daughter’s treatment.

'Systematic failing': Staff at the hospital had been using out-of-date guidelines for pregnancy scans, which led to false diagnoses

The report found that UHW did not tell staff to 
carry out the internal scans. Instead they relied on Doppler scans that 
in Miss Wheatley’s case could have been ‘potentially dangerous’.

Even
when the guidance was re-worded in 2011 to emphasise the need for TV 
scans in early miscarriage, the UHW policy went unchanged.

Mr Tyndall 
criticised the Cardiff and Vale Health Board for not updating its 
guidelines and told them to pay Miss Wheatley £1,500 in compensation.

Mr
Tyndall said: ‘Were it not for the fortunate circumstance of [Miss 
Wheatley] seeking  her post-miscarriage care at  an alternative 
hospital, it seems likely that these failings would have resulted in the
medical termination of a healthy, viable pregnancy.’

RCOG spokesman 
Siobhan Quenby said: ‘This is a  really big issue because we have to be 
100 per cent certain that a miscarriage has taken place – 97 per cent is
no good for the 3 per cent of women for whom the wrong diagnosis would 
be a disaster.’

Cardiff and Vale Health Board said it made an ‘unreserved apology’ to Miss Wheatley.
