The owner of a bridal shop linked to Ebola nurse Amber Vinson announced this week that the store was closing because it lost significant business and has been stigmatized.

Miss Vinson, a nurse at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, was diagnosed with Ebola days after visiting Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio in October. 

The store temporarily closed and cleaned before reopening in November but business has failed to bounce back.

Anna Younker, who owns Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio, announced this week that she would be closing her doors after the business never recovered following a visit from Ebola patient Amber Vinson last year

Owner Anna Younker, who has been in business for 30 years, said her shop has become known as the 'Ebola store'. 

She told the Akron Beacon Journal that the temporary closure and canceled orders cost the store at least $100,000.  The loss wasn't covered by her insurance because the plan excludes viral illnesses.

Ms Younker told NewsNet5 that Miss Vinson, who was visiting her hometown for a few days to plan for her wedding, should have been more careful. 

'I wish that now she knew better not to travel. The impact its had on me is huge,' the store owner said. 'Never in a million years did I expect something like this to cause our business to have to close.'

Shop assistant Kayla Litz, who is about to lose her job, had a particularly worrying time during the Ebola scare because she is pregnant 

Ms Younker said she was particularly offended when Miss Vinson, 29, asked  for a $480 refund on her bridesmaid dresses.

Miss Vinson, who has since recovered from Ebola, asked that the shop refund her bridesmaids the $479.89 they paid for their dresses, via her attorney. 

Ms Younker said the refund request feel like 'a slap in the face'.

On Wednesday, the store owner posted a message to customers on Facebook, announcing that her business would be closing down.

'Despite our best efforts, we simply have been unable to recover,' she wrote. 'The decision for me to close was not easy for me. 

'Over the years I have met and worked with the most amazing brides, mothers of brides, bridesmaids, prom girls and many other wonderful people.

'I want to thank all our customers, the people in our community and the well wishers from afar for being so supportive. Your kind words and loyalty have been great comfort. 

'I also want to thank my amazing staff for all of their hard work and dedication to our customers and our business. I appreciate your understanding and support.'

One of the four staff members losing their jobs, Kayla Litz, told NewsNet5 that the Ebola scare had been particularly worrying for her because she was in her first trimester of pregnancy at the time. 

Ms Litz came through the quarantine period of 21 days Ebola-free along with the other employees of the store. 

The store will take orders until the end of January and then sell dresses at discounts and liquidate all assets.
