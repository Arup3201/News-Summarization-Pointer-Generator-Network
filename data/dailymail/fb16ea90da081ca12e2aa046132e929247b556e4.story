Deaths on Britain’s roads rose last year for the first time in nearly a decade, official figures reveal.

There were a total of 1,901 reported 
deaths on Britain's roads last year - a three per cent increase on 2011,
equating to 51 extra lost lives.

Of most concern were rises in pedestrian deaths and in serious injuries to cyclists.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening blamed last year’s bad weather, while opposition politicians pointed to cuts to road safety budgets.

Motoring groups said the figures should be ‘a wake-up call’ for the Government. The RAC Foundation also pointed to increasing use by drivers and pedestrians of distracting iPods and smartphones.

Deaths and serious injuries reached 25,023 – up 2 per cent on 2010 and the first rise since 1994.

Pedestrian deaths increased by 12 per cent, to 453 fatalities – with by far the biggest increase among children and pensioners.

Serious injuries among cyclists were up 16 per cent to 3,085, and have risen by more than a quarter in just two years, the Department for Transport figures showed.

The biggest rise was among adult cyclists, with 2,287 cases – up 21 per cent. However the number of cycling deaths dropped by four per cent to 107. Driver and car passenger deaths also rose – up 6 per cent to 883 deaths.

The Department for Transport statistical bulletin said: ‘Adverse weather (heavy snowfalls) experienced in the first and last quarters of 2010 but not in 2011 are likely to be a factor in the increase in serious road casualties and fatalities recorded in 2011.’

Transport Secretary Justine Greening told the House of Commons: ‘We had some exceptional weather in that period and that was one of the reasons why there was such a change.’

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said Britain’s roads are still among the safest in the world but was ‘disappointed’ at the figures, adding: ’Any road death or injury is a tragedy and I will continue to take urgent action to crack down on the most dangerous drivers while improving the training to make our roads safer for everyone.’

Labour’s shadow transport minister Jim Fitzpatrick believed a decision by the previous Conservative Transport Secretary Philip Hammond to scrap casualty reduction targets was to blame for the rising death toll.

He said: ‘Since the election the Government has axed road safety grants, removed all funding for speed cameras, approved a trial of longer HGVs and is considering a blanket increase in the motorway speed limit.’

Robert Gifford, executive director of the Parliamentary Advisory Committee for Transport Safety (PACTS) said pedestrian and cyclist casualty figures were particularly worrying, pointing to the rise of the ‘born again cyclist’.

He said: ‘These are extremely disappointing results after two years of substantial falls in deaths and injuries.

Weather: Transport Secretary Justine Greening cited the harsh winter as a factor

They are a demonstration of the concern that all of us have expressed about the lack of leadership, priority and resources given to road safety by the current Government.

‘For deaths to begin to rise at a time of recession should be a matter of concern to ministers who should see these figures as a wake-up call.’

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said the figures were ‘sobering’ and questioned whether the use by pedestrians and drivers of distracting iPhones, iPods and smart phones to text and surf the internet was to blame.

Professor Glaister said: ‘It is notable that car drivers and passengers make up less than half of those killed, with pedestrians in particular also paying a heavy price in terms of lives lost.

‘We need to know why this is. Is it due to more and more people being distracted by using mobile phones and listening to music?’

AA head of road safety Andrew Howard said: ‘It may well be that the weather in 2010 did make that year’s figures look good. But we also have to suspect that the price of fuel throughout 2011 is all that has prevented road casualties for 2011 being much, much higher than in 2010.’

He said ministers ‘must not allow complacency to set in’ adding: ‘The rise in pedestrian deaths and cycle casualties continues to be a major cause for concern’.
