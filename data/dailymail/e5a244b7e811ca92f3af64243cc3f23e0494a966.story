Workers have begun a last-ditch attempt to save a notorious 10,000-year-old route on top of one of the country's highest summits.

Striding Edge is a dangerous knife-edged path on Helvellyn, in the Lake District, but years of erosion along the route is damaging wildlife.

Now more than 100 tonnes of stone are being shipped to the path, via helicopter, to try to restore its surface.

In the Lake District, walkers were treated to a dramatic sight as a helicopter, pictured, was drafted in to save an eroding mountain ridge. Striding Edge, on the approach to Helvellyn is a challenging ridge, know as an arete, created by two glaciers

A total of 136 helicopter trips and three months of intense work will attempt to hide the easier paths created by the hundreds-of-thousands of climbers that visit each year.

Richard Fox is the Ranger for Fix The Fells, the team carrying out the work, and is adamant work needs to be done as soon as possible.

It is one of England's few mountanious regions - all land in England above 3,000ft (910 metres) lies in the Lake District National Park.

The highest peak is Scafell Pike at 3,209ft (978 metres) - the tallest mountain in England.

It belongs to a rock group called Borrowdale Volcanic Series, which is resistant to weathering and dates back 500 million years.

Many features in the Lake District are the result of glaciation, which ended 15,000 years ago.

The large 'U-shaped' valleys were formed by retreating glaciers.

He said: 'People have created new paths when trying to avoid the original route along Striding Edge and this has caused erosion.

'The soil is being washed into [the lake] Red Tarn, and changing the acidic levels in the water.

'Species of Arctic fish there need the right conditions to lay their eggs.

'It isn't just about the wildlife though. We are trying to make the route look natural again.

'It is a sensitive sight and people will think it should be left alone. But we are doing this to conserve the landscape.

'We are successful if you can't tell we have been there when our work is finished.'

There can be up to 2,000 climbers on the route at any one time, and it is only in the last 30 to 40 years that the eroded land has become a problem.

Tanya Oliver, program manager for Fix the Fells, led by the National Trust, added: 'The rocks are being delivered so people don't see other paths that have emerged, and don't use them again.

'We will be putting information boards highlighting the dangers on Striding Edge for climbers unfamiliar of the challenge.'

The route is popular with walkers taking on the 3,100ft (950 metres) summit of Helvellyn, but over the years erosion has caused problems. National Trust Rangers and a helicopter, pictured, were drafted in to transport 135 bags of stone, weighing 188 stone (750kg) each up to the mountain ridge to disguise the easier routes

The scenery of the Lake District was created largely by glacial movements of the last ice age between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago and the volcanic eruptions that preceded it. The stones (pictured) should help to preserve the area from further erosion

Striding Edge (pictured) is part of the Helvellyn mountain in the English Lake District. The mountain is 3,117 feet (950 metres) above sea level and is the third highest peak in England. Striding Edge is a popular scrambling route that stretches for over a mile (1.6 kilometres) to the Helvellyn summit plateau
