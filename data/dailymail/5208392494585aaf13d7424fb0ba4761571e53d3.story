A new six-runway hub airport to the east of London could be built within seven years at a cost of £47.3billion.

However, the ambitious plans would require the closure of Heathrow airport, which employs 76,000 people.

The proposed new airport would sit on a purpose-built island off the Isle of Sheppey in Kent in the Thames Estuary, some 50 miles east of central London, and would be known as London Britannia Airport.

The British government and business 
groups want to expand flights to fast-growing economies to ensure the UK
can tap into billions of pounds of trade opportunities. With Heathrow, 
London's biggest airport, operating at 99 per cent capacity, more 
runways are needed.

However, the island airport has been criticised by environmental groups, who say the estuary is not just 'dead space waiting for development'.

The proposal was released by Thames Estuary Research and Development (Testrad), a consortium formed by London Mayor Boris Johnson to address the capital's air capacity crunch.

The plan, to be launched on Monday at the House of Lords, comes two years after architect Norman Foster unveiled proposals for a four-runway hub in the Thames Estuary, backed by Johnson and dubbed 'Boris Island'.

The estuary airport is a passion project for Mr Johnson, who has blasted plans for a third - or even fourth - runway at Heathrow.

He said any expansion will 'consign millions of Londoners to unacceptable levels of noise pollution', while a three-runway airport would be 'obsolete' as soon as it was built.

Testrad said the new hub would have six runways and could be built within seven years without having to demolish houses or industrial infrastructure. It will also create 200,000 jobs.

'This project avoids flying over densely
populated areas of London and the south east, removing completely the 
noise contours and impact which have bedevilled millions of people 
throughout and around London over the past 40 years,' a Testrad 
spokeswoman said.

Testrad has proposed the Heathrow site is 'recycled' into a new borough for London, creating housing and business opportunities.

It added: 'Under wartime legislation in 1944, the village of Heathrow and valuable farmland was requisitioned for a new military airfield.

'Relocation and recycling the tightly constrained Heathrow airport site as a city extension for London, will allow a transformation of acres of runway concrete into a real piece of city, with the return of bio-diversity, in gardens, lakes and a landscape park system full of trees, birds and other wildlife.'

The Conservatives
last year set up the UK Airports Commission, chaired by Howard Davies, 
to look into airport capacity in southern England. It is due to publish a
list of potential schemes by the end of this year with the final report
due after the 2015 general election.

Earlier this year bosses at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports urged the government to let them build additional runways to solve the capacity shortage, plans vigorously opposed by Johnson.

He previously proposed a new four-runway hub should be built either east of central London on the Isle of Grain or further out in the Thames Estuary on an artificial island.

In July Mr Johnson, said: 'This is further welcome argument in favour of the feasibility of having a new hub airport in the Thames estuary.

The scheme has attracted condemnation from a number of environmental groups, notably Friends Of The Earth, WWF and Greenpeace UK.

The Royal Society For The Protection Of Birds (RSPB) has also dismissed the campaign and says the consortium has failed to address the 'considerable' environmental issues.

It said much of the estuary has international environmental protection and added that hundreds of thousands of birds use the estuary as a major migratory route, posing a considerable threat to planes from bird strike.

Chris Corrigan, the RSPB’s Director for South East England said: 'Boris continues to pursue this pipe dream, but no amount of wishful thinking on his behalf changes the fact that the Thames Estuary is not dead space waiting for development.

'It is home to an immense number of birds and other wildlife. You can not recreate the estuary nor move the native or migratory wildlife that relies on it for food and shelter.

'I'm sure the Mayor doesn't want to go down in history as the man who decimated not just birds in the Thames, but global species too, while putting air passengers lives at risk due to bird strike.

'With so many options available for a multi-runway hub airport in a new location, it would be folly for the Airports Commission to give countenance to the prospect of expanding Heathrow, the most noise-polluting airport in Europe.'

But Heathrow vehemently opposes the plans. In June Colin Matthews, CEO of Heathrow, said: 'Britain already has one of the world’s most successful international hub airports in Heathrow.

'Expanding Heathrow will put Britain ahead in the global race, connecting UK business to growth more quickly and at less cost to the taxpayer than any other option for new capacity.

'Heathrow is better located for passengers, business and jobs. Why build from scratch at a new hub when we can build on the strength that already exists around Heathrow today?'
