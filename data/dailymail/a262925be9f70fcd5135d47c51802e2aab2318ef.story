A remarkable video has emerged showing a marine who has just been shot in the neck managing to run to a rescue helicopter.

The incredible footage was captured by a tiny camera strapped on to the body of one of his comrades.

The U.S serviceman was patrolling muddy terrain in Afghanistan when the bullet struck him.

Scroll down to watch video

Bravery: The marine lies on the ground, his face contorted with agony, after being shot in the neck

In the short clip he falls to the ground and lays on his back in a ditch.

He can be seen clutching his right shoulder in pain with the mud behind turning a dark shade of red as blood trickles out of his wound.

When a fellow marine comes to his rescue, he struggles to remove his body armour so grabs a knife and cuts through the straps.

Agony: A red stain of blood, left,  can be seen seeping through his combat reliefs on his shoulder immediately after he is shot. He then falls to the ground in a ditch as another soldier applies pressure to the wound

Medical treatment: A medic approaches the stricken marine from behind as he lays on the ground and rips open surgical gauze as another soldier applies pressure to the wound

A medic then approaches the stricken marine from behind as he lays on the ground and rips open a pack of surgical gauze as another soldier applies pressure to the wound to stem the blood flow.

He then kneels down in the muddy water and cuts off the rest of the wounded soldier's combat fatigues.

By this point the marine's helmet and googles have been removed and his face contorts in agony as he is helped. 

Determined: The marine, left, runs to the safety of the awaiting helicopter

Safety: After getting on the aircraft, the person who has the camera on their head, gives him a thumbs up and the helicopter can be seen flying away

The bandage is wrapped around his shoulder and he is sat up by the medic, although he is starting to look visibly paler due to the blood loss.

But amazingly he is then shown running across the ground to an awaiting helicopter, with a small dog bounding ahead.

After getting on the aircraft, the person who has the camera on their head, gives him a thumbs-up and the helicopter can be seen flying away.

The marine has not been identified, but it was reported that he made a full recovery.

Lucky escape: The helicopter flies off with the marine safely aboard
