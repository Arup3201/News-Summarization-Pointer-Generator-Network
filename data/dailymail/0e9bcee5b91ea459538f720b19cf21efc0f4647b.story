Confession: The note that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev wrote explains the motives behind the bombings and says that he doesn't mourn his brother because he is a martyr

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev thought he was dying when he was hiding out in a boat following the Boston Marathon bombings and chose to write a note confessing his connection to the blasts and explaining why he and his brother made the two pressure cooker bombs.

The 19-year-old found a pen in the boat but no paper so it was revealed today that he wrote his message on an interior wall of the boat that he used as shelter in Watertown.

His message was clear: 'F*** America'.

In other portions of his message, ABC News reports that he wrote 'Praise Allah' and mentioned 'infidels' across the interior walls of the boat that are now riddled with bullets.

Law enforcement sources told CBS that Dzhokhar wrote that he 'does not mourn' the death of his older brother Tamerlan because he is a martyr living in 'paradise' and that he expected to join him there soon.

The note is a critical piece of evidence for police as it reiterates what Dzhokhar said to them  in the hospital after his arrest.

Aside from simply confirming his other statements, it could serve as back up for the eventual legal case against him because the reported confession to police came before Dzhokhar was read his Miranda rights informing him of his right to remain silent.

After they were read, he reportedly stopped talking to police, but now the note will serve as a handwritten confession.

Caught: Dzhokhar wrote the note on the interior wall of the boat where he hid out following the city-wide manhunt

Damage: Because police shot the boat when they were trying to catch the 19-year-old, the note was riddled with bullet holes since he wrote it on an interior wall and not a piece of paper

He wrote that the bombings were retribution for the various American crimes against Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Administrators at the Boston Marathon are looking to the future, saying that any runners who were unable to complete the race this year because of the bombings have been invited to race in next year's competition free of charge.

'Boston spectators are known for their impassioned support and unbridled enthusiasm, and they will give these returning athletes some of the loudest cheers at next year's race,' the group's executive director Tom Grilk said.

The symbolic move will be a costly one for the organization, as there were 5,633 runners who are eligible and will not have to submit the $110 entry fee. 

If every one of the invited runners come back next year, it will cost $619,630 for the marathon organizers.

He equated the three people who were killed in the marathon bombings and the more than 250 others who were injured to 'collateral damage' like the thousands of innocent Muslim victims of American wars across the globe.

'When you attack one Muslim, you attack all Muslims,' he reportedly wrote.

CBS reporter John Miller pointed out that the note is just the latest piece of evidence that police are using in developing their theory that the Chechen brothers worked alone and were self-radicalized rather than being the ‘soldiers’ for a larger group.

Investigators are still working to determine who else- if anyone- knew about the attack before it happened.

While the note is undoubtedly a boost
 for the state's case against the 19-year-old suspect, who is now being 
held in the medical center of an area prison, it is hardly cut and dry.

Because
 police fired hundreds of bullets at the boat during their attempt to 
capture Dzhokhar, the note is riddled with bullet holes.

He has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction and the note will certainly be used in the case against him.

Collateral damage: In his note, Dzhokhar said that the victims of the April 15 bombing were like the innocent Muslims who had been killed in American wars abroad
