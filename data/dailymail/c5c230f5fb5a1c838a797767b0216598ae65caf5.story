An artist from Seattle has created a form of street art that is guaranteed to brighten up your rainy day.

Rainworks, the brainchild of Peregrine Church, is a form of water-activated art that only becomes visible when it is raining.

Its inventor came up with the concept when he discovered superhydrophobic coating – a nanoscopic surface layer that repels water.

He claims that he was intrigued by the numerous viral videos that featured the miracle substance and believed he could create interesting patterns with light and dark contrasts on pavements.

Travelling around the streets of his native Seattle, Peregrine sprays through stencils to create motivational messages – that are initially invisible – on the ground.

Demonstrating his work in the video, the artist throws a bucket of water onto a piece of inconspicuous pavement and from nowhere a hopscotch appears on the floor.

Discussing his work, he says: ‘I make things that make the world a more interesting place like a Rainwork.’

Featured on his computer, Peregrine designs a number of feel-good stencils to be used on the street.

He notes that Seattle is a place synonymous with rainfall and that his artwork is therefore ideal for the seaport city.

Later in the video he discusses his numerous murals and where they can be found in and around Seattle and as far as Olympia.

 He says: ‘The very first one I did said ‘stay dry out there’ and had a bunch of raindrops falling. It was on a bus stop. 

'And now there are about 25 to 30 Rainworks out there.’

The video concludes with the artist positively noting: ‘It’s going to rain no matter what, so why not do something cool with it?’

Peregrine uploads examples of his work to his website and the original video can be viewed here.
