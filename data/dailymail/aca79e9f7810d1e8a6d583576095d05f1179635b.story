With an increasing number of families and unaccompanied children pouring across the border, it has become one of America's most pressing issues. 

Now, a survey has revealed the town which plays host to the most immigrants in every U.S. state. 

The research, based on figures from the Census Bureau, shows that a staggering 74 per cent of the locals in Sweetwater, Florida, were born in another country.

Meanwhile, more than 67 per cent of the residents in Langley Park, Maryland,  66.9 per cent in Palisades Park, New Jersey and 62.6 per cent in Toughkenamon, Pennsylvania, are immigrants. 

In New York, a fewer 47.1 per cent of locals in Spring Valley are foreign-born - the highest number in the state.

But at the other end of the spectrum, only 4.7 per cent of people in Bigfork, Montana, are immigrants.

The research, carried out by Business Insider, looked at towns, cities and villages with at least 1,000-strong populations using estimates from the 2008-2012 American Community Survey.

Unsurprisingly, Latin America was found to be the most common birthplace among immigrants.

It comes just days after it emerged that President Barack Obama is on pace  to deport the fewest number of immigrants since at least 2007.

According to an analysis of Homeland Security Department figures by The Associated Press, the federal agency responsible for deportations sent home 258,608 immigrants between the start of the budget year last October and July 28 this summer.

During the same period a year earlier, it removed 320,167 people — meaning this year saw a decrease in deportations by nearly 20 percent.

The figures, contained in weekly internal reports marked 'Official Use Only,' reflect the marked decline in deportations, while Mr Obama has delayed announcing what changes he will make to U.S. immigration policies through executive action.

The President said he would act before the end of the summer, but White House officials said last weekend that he would postpone his decision until after November's elections.

The announcement came much to the chagrin of Latino leaders; many of whom believe Mr Obama's deported too many immigrants

Since taking office, Mr Obama's administration has removed more than 2.1 million immigrants from the country.
