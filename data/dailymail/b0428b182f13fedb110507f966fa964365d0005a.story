In 2017, a rare planetary alignment will see Mars and Earth orbit as close as they possibly can to each other and a billionaire plans to take advantage of this by launching a manned mission to the red planet.

New York engineer Dennis Tito wants to launch a shuttle, manned by two astronauts, on an 800 million-mile journey to Martian space that could launch as early as Christmas Day 2017.

The shuttle will then spend a total of 16 months travelling to within 100 miles of Mars before being flung back to Earth.

New York billionaire Dennis Tito wants to launch a shuttle, with two astronauts on board, on an 800-mile journey to Mars by 5 January 2018. The shuttle will then spend a total of 16 months travelling to within 100 miles of Mars before being flung back to Earth

The orbits of Earth and Mars mean the 
planets approach each other every 26 months.

In late 2017, a rare planetary alignment will see Mars and Earth orbit as close as they possibly can to each other.

This rare alignment happens only twice every 15 years.

When the planets are as close as they 
can be, the amount of time the astronauts will need to spend in space as
 well as the amount of fuel needed, is at its lowest.

This means the chances of the mission being successful and the shuttle arriving back safely is increased.

If 73-year-old Tito doesn’t launch the shuttle in 2018 he’ll have to wait until 2031 to try again.

This rare alignment happens only twice every 15 years and if 73-year-old Tito doesn’t launch the shuttle between December 25th 2017 and January 5th 2018, he will need to wait until 2031 to try again.

When the planets are this close, the amount of time the astronauts will need to spend in space as well as the amount of fuel needed, is at its lowest.

This means the chances of the mission being successful and the shuttle arriving back safely is increased.

The planets are set to align again in 2021, although won’t be as close to one another as they will be in 2018.

If Tito was to try again then, the journey would take 80 days longer and require the shuttle to fly closer to the sun, adding radiation risks.

Nasa has previously said that the optimum time to launch a Mars mission would a ‘few months’ before Earth and Mars are closest together, a time astronomers call opposition. 

Tito announced his plans, dubbed Inspiration Mars, during a hearing at the House of Representatives subcommittee on space on Wednesday.

He said: ‘It would be a voyage of around 800 million miles around the sun in 501 days.

The orbits of Earth and Mars mean the planets approach each other every 26 months. In late 2017, a rare planetary alignment will see the planets orbit as close as they possibly can to each other. At this distance the amount of time the shuttle will need to spend in space as well as the amount of fuel needed, is at its lowest

‘No longer is a Mars flyby mission just one more theoretical idea. It can be done. Not in a matter of decades, but in a few years.’

The shuttle will be manned by one male and one female astronaut, both from America, although the names of the candidates have not been announced.

Tito’s mission will be financed from private donations, as well as support from government sources, and he is working with Nasa’s Ames Research Center and Applied Defense Solutions, among others.

Tito is an engineer who was born in 
Queens, New York City in 1940.

In 1962 he graduated with a degree in 
Astronautics and Aeronautics from New York University.

Two years 
later he gained a Masters in Engineering Science from Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute.

Tito made his money through an investment 
management company he set up during the 1970s called Wilshire Associates.

The companies assets are said to be worth around $71 billion.

In
 2001, Tito spent nearly eight days in orbit as a crew member on board 
the Russian spacecraft ISS EP-1 as it visited the International Space 
Station.  He is also a former scientist from the Nasa Jet Propulsion Lab.

In response to the Tito’s plans, Nasa spokesman David Weaver said:  ‘Inspiration Mars’s proposed schedule is a significant challenge due to life support systems, space radiation response, habitats and the human psychology of being in a small spacecraft for over 500 days.

‘The agency is willing to share technical and programmatic expertise with Inspiration Mars but is unable to commit to sharing expenses with them. However, we remain open to further collaboration as their proposal and plans for a later mission develop.’

The mission will take place when Mars and Earth become aligned in 2018

This is when the planets are the closest they can possibly get to each other
