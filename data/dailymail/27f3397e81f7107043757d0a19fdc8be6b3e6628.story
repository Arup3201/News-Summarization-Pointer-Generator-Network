Could this be the worst corner routine ever devised by a professional football team? FK Pribram, who play in the top tier of Czech football, tried something a little different in their 1-1 draw with Teplice at the weekend.

Lining up for a corner, five of their outfield players congregated on the edge of the opposition box, before spinning around in a circle - one way, then the other - as they waited for the corner to come in.

As the Teplice players watched on in awe, Pribram struck. Suddenly, they turned and sprinted into the box in tandem, ready to attack the incoming corner.

WATCH: Take a look at the corner routine in question 

The players (right) stood in a circle and spun around manically before the corner came in

After a short while, the Pribram players tried to catch the opposition off-guard with a sprint into the box

Unfortunately, the ball was too deep and a player was left to chase it towards the corner flag

Unfortunately, after all their effort, the ball in was overhit and one Pribram player was left sprinting towards the corner flag to retrieve in.

He didn't get there, and the move was over. Back to the training ground, eh lads.

Pribram sit 12th after their first 14 games this season, but face a stern test this weekend when they host Sparta Prague.
