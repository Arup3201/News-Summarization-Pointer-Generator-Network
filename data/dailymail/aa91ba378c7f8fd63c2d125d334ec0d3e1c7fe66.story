Michael Graydon, 29, had been missing for two weeks before his body was found in  Monaco today

A British boxing promoter has been found dead in Monaco after going missing two weeks ago.

Michael Graydon, 29, from Stockwood, Bristol, became separated from a friend outside the Rascasse nightclub on February 21, and was last seen on CCTV at about 1.30am. 

The father-of-one was in the principality  to watch a boxing match featuring Bristol fighter and friend, Lee Haskins.

But he never made it to the event and missed his flight home, prompting a major police search around harbours and marinas nearby.

The body was found today 'behind a little church' in the Sainte Devote area of Monaco, close to where he was last seen, a Monaco government spokeswoman confirmed.

Genevieve Berti, deputy director of the Monaco Media Bureau, said: 'We can confirm on the death of a British national - Michael Graydon, who had previously been reported missing, in Monaco.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'

Ms Berti added that footage showed Mr Graydon climbing over the wall of a property and said it is believed that he then fell.

She added that the body was unrecognisable due to be in an advanced state of decomposition, but tattoos on the arms were 'really comparable' to the ones described by his family.

He was also carrying his driving licence, which confirmed the name of Michael Graydon.

Ms Berti said the death is not being treated as suspicious, adding that no one else can be seen in the CCTV images. 

Following his disappearance a 12-strong group of close family and friends travelled to central Monaco to hand out leaflets and meet police and legal officials.

He became separated from a friend outside the Rascasse night club and was last seen on CCTV at 1.36am

The former boxer missed the match he was due to watch and flight home, prompting a huge police search

Stacey Marie Jones, a close friend, described Mr Graydon as 'the kind of man who would do anything for anybody'.

Speaking before today's discovery, she said: 'He is such a family man and such a mother's boy that we knew that when he had not been in contact with his mother that something was wrong.

'We are not leaving Monaco and we are not going to stop until we have answers and until he is back home with us - whether that be in body or in spirit.

'He has a two-year-old son, Reuben, who will need answers. We do not believe that anyone can go missing in Monaco and no-one would know what happened to him.' 

Well-wishers raised £15,000 since Tuesday to help fund the search and hire lawyers in Monaco, while members of the public held a march in Bristol to support his family and friends. 

A message posted on a social media page, set up to help find Mr Graydon, said today: 'From the family and friends of Michael, thank you for the support and messages over the last weeks. It meant so much.' 

After his disappearance a group of 12 family and friends flew to Monaco to start searching for him themselves

They set up a social media page and gave out flyers in a bid to find Mr Graydon - described as a family man
