Backing return: Lynne Truss has called for the return of 1960s and 70s panel show Many a Slip as a gentle daily reminder of language laws

It entertained her as a teenager and taught her much of what she knows about grammar today.

And now Lynne Truss has called for the return of 1960s and 70s panel show Many a Slip as a gentle daily reminder of language laws.

Yesterday Miss Truss, 59, who is best known for her book Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation, said she thinks the programme was axed because pointing out mistakes have become associated with ‘mean-spiritedness, snobbishness and judgmentalism’.

It means errors such as a misplaced apostrophe or forgotten comma – which can change the meaning of a sentence altogether – are allowed to go unmentioned. And as a result poor grammar has crept into acceptable use.

Raising the call for the return of Ian Messiter’s Many a Slip, which ended its run in 1979, Miss Truss said: ‘I find it slightly odd that the excellent Just a Minute (similarly devised by Ian Messiter) has survived right through to the present day, while Many a Slip last appeared on the airwaves the year that Margaret Thatcher was elected prime minister, Sid Vicious died, and President Carter was attacked by a killer rabbit. I wonder why it died?

‘What has happened since 1979, I suspect, is that the spotting of mistakes has become entirely associated with mean-spiritedness, snobbishness and judgmentalism. 

But if you listen to Many a Slip, you will find that the spotting of mistakes can be, on the contrary, funny and interesting, and surprisingly easy to join in with.

‘Besides, no one can argue that the world is now such an easy-going, forgiving sort of place, where no errors are ever drawn attention to. It’s quite the opposite, with social media permanently poised to jump on (and punish) the slightest slip-up of behaviour, or judgment, from celebrities.’

She added: ‘I really think they should bring it back. It could be wildly popular. But who’d chair it? Who would dare?’

Many a Slip, which aired for 14 years, was a game show that revolved around spotting errors in passages of text.

They could be contradictions, errors of fact or grammar or repetition. And it involved light teasing between the two teams which both entertained and educated listeners.

Reminiscing about the programme Miss Truss said: ‘This was such a gentle game. Since the mistakes were all intentional, no one was made to look stupid. The listeners were not only entertained but gently educated. As a teenaged listener, I was in awe at the cleverness of such regular contestants as Isobel Barnett and David Nixon.

‘They could hear a sentence such as, “He was mortally wounded so badly that he died” and buzz in with the objection, “Tautology!” I mention this because although spotting tautology isn’t the most important of all life skills, I do owe my own awareness of tautology’s existence entirely to Many a Slip.’

Miss Truss’ other books about punctuation include The Girl’s Like Spaghetti: Why, You Can’t Manage Without Apostrophes! And Twenty-Odd Ducks: Why, Every Punctuation Mark Counts!,

Writing in the Radio Times, she said: ‘The world is full of people who love to spot a mistake. Not only do they love to spot them, they enjoy pointing them out as well. I can say this with such confidence because ever since I wrote my book on grammar, I receive sightings of mistakes virtually every day, some of which are (unintentionally) rather brilliant. 

'Outside a card shop, for example, it might say: “Spoil your loved one’s Valentine’s Day 14 February” – when the actual intention was to write: “Spoil your loved ones! Valentine’s Day, 14 February.” 

'Similarly, there is (according to legend, anyway) a sign inside the door to a block of flats somewhere that says: “Residents refuse to go in the bins”. But who can blame those residents for refusing to go in the bins? If you lived there, I absolutely guarantee you would refuse to go in the bins as well.’

On Saturday Miss Truss will introduce her favourite programmes from the Radio 4 archive – including Many a Slip – in a three-hour Radio 4 Extra broadcast called Lynne Truss: Pick of the Archive.
