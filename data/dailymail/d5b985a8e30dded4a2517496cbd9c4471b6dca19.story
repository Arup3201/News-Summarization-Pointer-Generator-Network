A dating expert set out to find out exactly what attracts men to women on Tinder, and ended up proving men can be as superficial as feared when it comes to choosing matches.

Hayley Quinn set up two contrasting profiles, using doctored images of herself and a 'dumbed down'  bio on one on to find out whether men preferred the real her - or a more superficial 'sexy' version of herself.

The London-based dating pro tested the relationship between the type of attention women get on Tinder in relation to the type of profile they created. 

Hayley created two contrasting profiles on the dating app; one for 'real' Hayley (left) and one for her sexed up alter ego 'Sonia' (right) 

The 27-year-old created two accounts - with the first for 'normal Hayley' describing herself as a yoga and hiking geek, who loves peanut butter and runs her own business.

The first account also used photographs that showed Hayley on holiday abroad or in everyday situations, such as after a workout at the gym.

The profile for fictitious 'Sonia' was then given the 'ultimate Tinder selfie makeover' with false eyelashes, hair extensions and ample cleavage on show, as well as enhancing the photos with various filters.

And the much more simplistic bio simply read: 'Love life. Love my friends. Xoxo'.

Hayley documented her experiment in an 11 minute video titled 'What girls do guys like on Tinder?'

But other than the choice of photos and descriptions - the profiles were set up in exactly the same way and the same amount of time was spent swiping 'yes' to potential love matches.

Perhaps unsurprisingly she had  most success as 'Sonia' - the profile which used her heavily altered images.

The first profile for Hayley received 195 matches while Sonia who received 324 matches.

But while the 'sexier' profile got the most male attention - Hayley found that men were more genuinely interested in her and interacted more with the profile that listed her interests and hobbies.

Hayley, who has helped more than 100,000 men find love, said: 'I decided to do the video because we live in a world that is lived out online.

'I was concerned that people were buying into a fake 'perfect' version of reality: rather than focusing on the real life changes that could find them a better partner.

'I was pleasantly surprised though that although the fake 'sexy' profile did better, there seemed to be more sincere interest in 'real' Hayley.

'The message seemed to be whatever you put out there will come right back to you.'
