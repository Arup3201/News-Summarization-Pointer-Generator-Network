If the pressure is getting to England as the countdown to their World Cup opener against Italy reaches boiling point, they certainly weren't letting it show.

Daniel Sturridge posted a group shot of Roy Hodgson's men on the team bus in Manaus before Saturday night's showdown as the squad travelled to a local shopping centre.

However many players soon left after being mobbed as fans attempted to get autographs and take snaps of the players.

Liverpool striker Sturridge also mocked Luke Shaw for his 'sweet boy pose' at the front of the coach snap, posting a message with the picture: 'Now we're cooking!! #squad #worldcup 2104 #team #england shoutout to Luke Shaw for the sweet boy pose. I see you baby lol.'

Meanwhile, Steven Gerrard posted a photograph on his Instagram account from the 'Manaus jungle' overlooking the Arena da Amazonia.

And judging by the caption accompanying the picture, the 34-year-old is itching to kickstart England's bid to lift the Jules Rimet trophy for a second time as he wrote: 'A view of the stadium through the jungle. The wait is almost over.'

The footballing showpiece in Brazil will be the third World Cup for the midfielder with the quarter-finals the furthest Gerrard has reached with his country back in 2006.

The Three Lions midfielder is expected to start for Roy Hodgson's side against the experienced Azzurri in a midfield match-up against Italy duo Andrea Pirlo and Daniele de Rossi.

After their opening match against the four-time tournament winners, England will face Uruguay on June 19 in Sao Paulo before taking on Costa Rica on June 24 in Belo Horizonte.
