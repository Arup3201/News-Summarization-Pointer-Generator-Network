Alert: Gregory Lewis fled his $1,000 bail in September and is suspected of at least six more violent sexual assaults across the country since

The nationwide manhunt for a child rape suspect has come to a dramatic end after he was arrested in Upstate New York Tuesday night after crashing his Jeep into the Hudson River following a police chase.  

Gregory Lewis, 26, spent more than a month on the run after cutting off his GPS minoring bracelet in Massachusetts and fleeing across the country.

Now, police reveal, he vowed to murder the 13-year-old girl who first accused him of sexually assaulting her. 

Lewis was arrested Tuesday night in Fort Edward, New York, after crashing his Jeep into the Hudson River during a brief chase. 

Police say he kidnapped, raped and robbed at least six women in North Carolina, Colorado, and Oregon during his crime spree that began on September 15. 

However, at the time of his arrest, he was 165 miles from Southbridge, Massachusetts, the hometown where his alleged teenage victim lives. 

Police said on Wednesday that during his crime spree, he told people he encountered that he planned to kill the 13-year-old victim.  

Lewis arrested after a New York State Police trooper spotted his blue Jeep with no license plates about 9.30pm outside Fort Edward. 

He fled, then crashed it into the Hudson River. 

'He actually drove to the end of a dead-end street and didn’t realize it was a dead end and drove down an embankment and into the water,' Fort Edward Police Chief Justin Durway told WBZ-AM. 

As he fled his sinking car on foot. When a witness came over to help him, Lewis threatened the man with a gun.

After a 20-minute search, a police dog found Lewis. Immediately after seeing police, he dropped his gun and raised his hands.

'Don't you know who I am?' to bragged to cops. 

Officers recovered the pistol, which he had stolen from his step-father during a violent robbery in Massachusetts.

Lewis is now being held in the Washington County jail, awaiting extradition to Massachusetts.

The crime spree began on September 15 when he cut off his court-ordered GPS ankle bracelet while free on bail in Southbridge, Massachusetts. He was awaiting trail on charges that he groomed then raped a 13-year-old girl.

The monitoring device was found in the girl's front yard.  

A nationwide alert had been sent to all law enforcement authorities to apprehend Lewis who is accused of luring multiple escorts to seedy motel rooms and beating and raping them.

'The victims have been handcuffed, threatened with a gun, robbed, and sexually assaulted,' says a report issued to all state police in an update.

Lewis was driving a blue 2004 Jeep Gran Cherokee that he stole from his stepfather on September 25 after returning home for an evening and beating and handcuffing him. He left home armed with cash, a 9mm handgun and more than 200 rounds of ammunition.

Lewis was first arrested on August 5 and charged with raping the 13-year-old girl.

He was released on $1,000 bail, a decision which left many dumbfounded.

'Certainly this gentleman should have never been released on bail,' said Southbridge Town Councilor Clemence to the Boston Herald.

'I hope that the judicial system will fix some of those mistakes because it’s wreaked havoc across the country.'

The circumstances that allowed a suspected child rapist to flee on an alleged cross country raping spree began when Judge Michael Allard-Madaus set bail for Lewis at only $1,000 - but on the condition he wore a GPS ankle bracelet and stay away from anyone under 16.

Police dog Nass, a black Labrador, tracked down Lewis and allowed officers to catch up with him and apprehend him

While out on bail on September 15, he drove to the girl's house, in breach of his bail, removed his GPS tag and left it on her lawn and vanished.

One week later, on September 23, ABC affiliate WSOC in Charlotte has reported that Lewis attacked a 29-year-old woman at a motel on Yorkmont Road.

The woman who didn't want to use her name said Lewis told her she he lived in Charlotte.

'I met him on Plenty of Fish, a dating website,' the woman told WSOC by phone.

It was just after arriving at the motel that Lewis began to attack the woman.

'He put me in a choke hold and put handcuffs on me with my hands behind my back and said I'm not going to hurt you I just want your money,' she said. to WSOC.

The woman managed to engineer her escape after telling Lewis that most of her money was in her car.

Police put out detailed identifying information in an attempt to find him, including a tattoo of a demonic female figure on his right upper arm and a tattoo of a hand holding a knife with a broken handcuff on his chest.

When they reached the parking lot, she fled.

Police have released several surveillance photos of Lewis from recent days, but have admitted he may have shaved his facial hair.

Two days after the North Carolina assault was when Lewis returned home to rob his stepfather.

He then traveled in his Jeep Cherokee to Denver in early October and is suspected of committing robberies and rapes there.

He then moved onto Portland, Oregon on or around October 13 and then moved onto Boise, Idaho and then in turn to Salt Lake City, Utah.

He is then thought to have made his way back through Denver and was last spotted in Columbus, Ohio over the weekend.

'We have reason to believe that Lewis is heading east again. We know that he was in the Columbus, Ohio, area Sunday evening and we know he was further west prior to that,' said state police spokesman David Procopio to the Boston Herald.
