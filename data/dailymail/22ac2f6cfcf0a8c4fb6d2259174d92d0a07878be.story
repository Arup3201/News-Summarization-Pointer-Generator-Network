Ronny Deila watched Celtic crash out of the Champions League in dismal fashion on Wednesday night – then vowed to build a completely new team.

The Norwegian suffered humiliation in his first major European test after Legia Warsaw followed their 4-1 first leg mauling with a 2-0 win in Edinburgh.

The final 6-1 aggregate defeat equalled the margin of the club’s previous worst loss to Juventus two years ago.

One for the fans: Legia supporters go wild following Zyro's opening goal at Murrayfield

Deila admitted his team are not good enough but must now negotiate a do or die Europa League play-off in a fortnight to salvage any hope of European football this season.

Speaking after supporters vented their anger in the direction of club directors at Murrayfield, Deila appealed for time and support to rebuild his squad saying: 'I will need to built up a new team.

'That’s two years in the Champions League for Celtic - but this year we’re not good enough. Not by far.

'That’s our goals as a club and we have to do everything we can to make it a different situation next year when we try and qualify for the Champions League.'

Chasing a miracle after a thumping defeat in Warsaw, the game was up for the Scottish champions after the opening goal from Michal Zyro after 35 minutes. A second for Michal Kucharczyk after an hour prompted anger from some Celtic fans in a 30,000 crowd.

'Today we lost to a better team,' added Deila. 'We have to say that over two matches, Legia were better than us.

'I think the players were fighting all they could but we didn’t have the quality to break them down.

'The second goal was poor defending also so we have a lot to work on.

'But also I have to accept that it is our level right now and we have to work from here. I have a big job to do to improve us as a team.

'We can still win the league and get into the Europa League as well this season which would be a very good achievement.

'Then I hope we can stand here next year and talk about happier things than this.'

Celtic’s board of directors face a furious inquest into their failure to spend substantial sums on new players, with free transfer keeper Craig Gordon and loan signing Jo Inge Berget the only new arrivals of the summer.

Goalkeeper Fraser Forster is likely to be the latest departure after handing his jersey to a supporter after Wednesday night’s game.

Southampton are now set to submit a fresh £7million bid for the England World Cup star after Celtic lost £15m in Champions League revenues last night.

'I came here to do a job and work with the club,' added Deila.

'I have only been here for six weeks but right now it’s not good enough. That’s what I can see.

'We need to make the squad better by getting new players, which we are working on.

'But also we need to get more from the players here – and there are a lot of skills and a lot of quality.'

Asked if Forster has played his final game, Deila was non committal.

'I don’t think so, we will see.

'But things have happened so quickly this last month you never know what’s happening.

'If that is happening we have to deal with that and that’s a position where we have good cover and opportunities.'
