A 29-year-old woman in Flagstaff, Arizona, has been reported missing after saying she was going for a walk but never returned.

Authorities are looking for the missing person, Amanda ‘Nykki’ Nicole Covey, who left Hidden Hollow Trailer Park on Sunday at around 3pm.

She has black, ‘mohawk-style’ hair that is shaved on the sides but typically wears a red wig.
