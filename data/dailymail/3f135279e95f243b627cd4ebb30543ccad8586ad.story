A Spanish butcher who cut up his own brother and stored the parts in his fridge-freezer next to his food has been caught after he turned himself in to the police.

Aurele Almanza, 48, claims to have killed his brother Osmas, 52, in self-defence, before slicing the body into pieces, neatly packing them away in freezer bags to escape arrest.

Mr Almanza's crime went undetected for a whole year before he confessed to local police on the Balearic Island of Mallorca.

When police visited Mr Almanza's house in the island's capital of Palma de Mallorca, they found the body expertly chopped up and the parts stored in a chest freezer.

The secodn gruesome discovery came when they opened his kitchen fridge-freezer, finding that he had stored his brother's head and other parts below shelves filled with fresh food.

Mr Almanza claims he murdered his brother after Osmas had tried to attack him with a hammer during a fight,

Almanza said he had offered his brother a place to stay when he fell on hard times, but that they had frequently argued, escalating into a physical attack ending in Osmas's death.

He claims that he only killed his brother in self defence upon the hammer attack, and then had sliced up the body when he realised what he had done.

He reportedly told police he had been haunted by the thought that his brother's body was packed away in the freezer.

Finally, after keeping his brother's head in his kitchen fridge for more than a year, he claims is 'became too much' forcing him to hand himself in.
