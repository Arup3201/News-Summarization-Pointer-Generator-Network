Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to cut the current £26,000 welfare cap to £23,000 within days of the Tories winning the general election

Tens of thousands of families where no one works will have their benefits slashed, David Cameron is to pledge today.

The current £26,000 cap would be cut to £23,000 within days of the Tories winning the general election, the Prime Minister will say.

As the campaign enters its final 100 days with two polls showing his party has moved into a narrow lead, Mr Cameron is also promising tax relief for the middle classes.

He is determined to ensure welfare is no longer a 'lifestyle choice', while rewarding those who are in work. He will pledge that the Conservatives would reduce the limit on handouts to jobless families within a week of being re-elected.

Housing benefit would be removed from jobless 18 to 21-year-olds, meaning they will have to live with their parents like millions of youngsters starting out in a job. 

The new cuts would squeeze the incomes of 100,000 jobless households and raise money to be ploughed into apprenticeships for three million school leavers. 

The Coalition has already introduced a welfare cap of £26,000 per household in what polls suggest is one of its most popular policies. However, further welfare cuts have been hampered by Liberal Democrat opposition.

Reducing the cap to £23,000 – equivalent to a pre-tax salary of around £29,300 – would hit an additional 70,000 workless households and save taxpayers an extra £135million per year, while the housing benefit squeeze on younger jobseekers would apply to 30,000 claimants and save a further £120million.

Only claimants of Disability Living Allowance would be exempt from the new cap.

In a swipe at Labour and the Liberal Democrats, Mr Cameron yesterday attacked the 'lie' that Britain would be better off paying more tax to continue funding higher benefits.

He said there was an 'economic, moral and practical' case for lower taxes, insisting British people 'deserve a reward' following years of austerity.

David Cameron today signalled that he will protect benefits for Britain's wealthiest pensioners.

The Prime Minister insisted there were not big savings to be made from cutting winter fuel payments, TV licences and bus passes for the well-off.

It raises the prospect of the Tories being the only major party going into the election vowing to preserve the payments for all over-65s, while cutting welfare for people of working age. 

Mr Cameron told BBC Radio4's Today programme: 'I've always said that there aren't huge savings to be made from axing these benefits and I think pensioners welcome the clarity that there has been. 

'I don't think it would be fair to ask pensioners to make the biggest adjustment. 

'Because when you are a pensioner it's more difficult to adjust your circumstances.

'I think that was the right commitment to make because dignity and security in old age should be part of the promise we make to people in our country.'

He admitted that too many people have been sucked into the 40p income tax band, including teachers and police officers. The Tories are pledging to increase the threshold for the 40p rate to £50,000 by 2020.

Mr Cameron said today: 'Conservatives believe we should be giving people the chance of a better future – while encouraging people on benefits back into work.

'For years we had a welfare system that kept people subsidised in poverty and forgot about them. Hard-working taxpayers were left to pick up the tab – and often they had lower incomes than those they supported on welfare. This is about ending that injustice.

'We are saying loud and clear that welfare is a safety net for those in hard times, not a lifestyle choice.

'We want to put people's hard-earned taxes into lifting people up, not holding them down – and that's what these three million apprenticeships will do. This is about being ambitious for Britain. We can give many more young people the chance to get on.

'We can help more people into work and out of poverty. We can secure a better future for everyone in Britain – but only if we stick to our long-term plan.'

Ministers say the £26,000 benefit cap has already helped encourage more than 12,000 households into work.

In total, 51,200 households have had their benefits capped since April 2013.

Two polls last night showed the Conservatives ahead of Labour for the first time since September 2011. ComRes put the Tories on 31 per cent (up two points since last month) Labour on 30 (-2), Ukip 17 (+1), Lib Dems 8 (-4) and the Greens 7 (+2).

A Survation poll for the Daily Mirror put the Tories on 31 and Labour 30. Ukip were third on 23 – far higher than in most recent surveys. Lord Ashcroft's weekly poll put the two main parties neck and neck on 32 with Ukip on 15, the Greens 9 and the Lib Dems 7.

Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'Labour supports a cap on benefits. We will ask an independent commission to look at whether the cap should be lower in some areas.

'But David Cameron can't hide from the fact that his government has spent GBP25 billion more than planned on welfare because of his failure to tackle the low pay that leaves millions dependent on benefits to make ends meet.

'And nobody will believe promises on apprenticeships from a government that had seen the number of apprenticeships for young people fall.'

Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: 'Let's be absolutely clear - the benefit cap is at least nine times more likely to affect children than adults, and the majority of adults it hits are lone parents, many of whom have children so young even the Government recognises they should not be required to work. 

'Britain is facing a looming child poverty crisis; lowering the benefit cap would bring it several steps closer. It would pile on the misery for working and non-working families already struggling to pay for absolute basics.

'Surely it would also fail the Prime Minister's own family test. Rather than taking away money from the poorest, politicians of all parties need to tackle the root causes of higher social security spending, which include soaring childcare and housing costs and low pay.'
