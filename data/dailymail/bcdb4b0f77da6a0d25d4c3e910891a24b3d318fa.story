Few are the men who don't enjoy watching the football but Lee Doran's passion for the beautiful game goes far beyond the norm.

Standing by her man: Amanda Hardman says her boyfriend has a sweet and caring side

A scion of The Chosen Few, Rochdale AFC's hardcore group of hooligan fans, the 37-year-old was recently banned from every football ground in the UK for four years after getting into a fight during a match in February and has been told he cannot travel to Rio for the World Cup.

'At the end of the the day, it's not 
really about fighting,' explains his other half, Amanda Hardman, 43. 'Its all about going out, having some banter and 
doing a bit of shouting and bawling.'

So what is sharing your life with a man so proud of his penchant for football violence he's happy to appear on a documentary named Football Hooligan And Proud really like?

Amanda, who says she hates football because it's 'boring' is surprisingly sanguine. 'I'm really not bothered [about Doran's activities] - it's just shouting and 
roaring,' she reveals.

'I don't find it intimidating,' she continues. 'I think you get more trouble down at the pub 
than you do on match day.

'There's never been a scrap - it's not 
like he comes home with black eyes or something. Even if they did try to
 do something, the police will split them up.

'They used to go on the 
rampage, looting, throwing chairs and stuff, but you can't do that now -
 there's police everywhere.'Â 

That, however, doesn't mean Doran himself isn't a fan of fisticuffs. 'At the age of 13, I started to want to fight,' he says.

Superfan: Lee is a member of The Chosen Few - Rochdale AFC's hardcore hooligan gangs

'I love fear. That's just me. I'm after, like, danger. Football violence is a feeling on its own.'

Despite his tough words, Amanda says the Lee Doran she knows is someone quite different - and who often brings her flowers and makes romantic gestures.

'He's got a nice side, he's caring,' she reveals, before adding: 'He's got a big gob though. He has a huge trap on him!'

Nevertheless, she says there are some downsides to living with an extreme football fan. 'It's chaos [on match day] - the house is full of Rochdale and City fans,' explains Amanda, who also has a football mad 21-year-old son.

'Football talk is all you hear all day and night in my house,' she complains. 'I end up having to go out!'

Worse, with the World Cup upon us, Amanda is having to contend with a solid month of football, football and more football.

'No, I'm not,' she says when asked if she's looking forward to kick off in Rio. 'I'll leave and go to my sister's!'

Not so scary: According to Ms Hardman, people get into more trouble down at their local pub

She would, however, be happy for Doran to put up a few England flags if he wants to. 'He can if he wants,' she says. 'He put up a big Rochdale flag for the documentary.'

Despite the impending football fest in Rio, the Channel 5 documentary, Football Hooligan and Proud, is what is really causing her a few sleepless nights.

'I am a bit worried about how they will portray him in the documentary,' she confesses.

What if he comes across as a thug? 'He is a thug,' she ripostes, adding: 'But it's not just him - there's thousands of them.'

And she isn't wrong. Doran is behind a 50,000 strong Facebook group where hooligans - would-be and current - can go to exchange gossip and organise meetings.

'They just all go on the site for the banter and talk a load of crap,' says Amanda. 'I don't go on it - it's boring.'

While she might find it boring, she says football hooligans certainly aren't as black as they're painted by the media and the authorities.

'They're just a bunch of lads going to the football who go and have a row with opposing fans. If that's the case, then everyone's a hooligan.

'If they do something down the pub, they just get sent home to sober up but if they do something in the stadium, they get arrested.

'Really, if they [Doran and his friends] are hooligans, then everyone's a hooligan.'

That doesn't mean she has any sympathy for Doran and his four year ban, however.

'If he's going to the match and they're going to cause bother, then he knows what's going to happen to him,' she raps. 'It's his own fault!'
