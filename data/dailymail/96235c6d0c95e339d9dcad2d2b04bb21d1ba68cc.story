A young amputee who was forced by a lifelong condition to have both her legs removed has become a model. 

Lizzy Holmes, 24, who was born with 'club foot' - meaning both her feet were back to front - has suffered a lifetime of chronic pain and endured 36 operations, the first when she was just 10 weeks old. 

Her first leg was amputated below the knee the day after her wedding to soldier Lewis Georgeson, 21. Now her other leg has been amputated - but that hasn't stopped her launching a modelling career.

A newlywed, who was forced to have both her legs amputated after being blighted with chronic illness since she was born with both feet back to front, has become a model

She said: 'I feel amazing, relieved and free. I have wanted to remove them for a long time as I know life will be much easier for me with prosthetic legs.'

Lizzy, from Oakwood, Leeds, was born with the condition, which has meant a lot of pain and operations, and regular morphine doses just to manage the pain. 

'I may never be completely pain-free, as the way I've walked has affected my spine, but I already feel much better,' she said. 

'While I am fit and young I can adapt to my new life. I don't let my disability stop me from doing anything. I love to swim and I am looking forward to hopefully raising some money myself so I can buy some special wet legs to swim properly.' 

The 24-year-old, who has undergone 36 operations, the first of which when she was just 10 weeks old, has defied the odds and signed her first modelling contract

Speaking about her condition, Lizzy said: 'From birth I was put into splints to manipulate the feet into a more normal position and at 10 week old I endured my first surgery in which they snipped my achilles tendon as it was very tight'

Speaking about the operation, Lizzy said: 'I feel amazing, relieved and free. I have wanted to remove them for a long time as I know life will be much easier for me with prosthetic legs'

Lizzy has now signed with a modelling agency and is their only double amputee model. She was signed up on the strength of just one picture.

She already has a photo-shoot booked. 'I can't wait to do some modelling, it will be brilliant,' she said. 'I am not embarrassed about my legs.'

She has had 'great' support from family and friends, including husband Lewis who is 'luckily strong enough to carry me when I need it'.

Lizzy added: 'At times in my life the pain had gotten to the point were I wanted to chop my own legs off and in the end I had to see a psychologist to try and change the thought process. From the age of seven I knew as soon as I could I would have my legs amputated'

Lizzy's condition is called congenital bilateral talipes equinovaurus, more commonly known as 'club feet', and she's had over twenty operations as a result

Lizzy trained as a nurse for two years but had to quit due to the heavy lifting required for some parts of the work. As well as her modelling, she is now studying with the Open University to become a primary school teacher.

Her sister Amy said her sibling's modelling bid was 'amazing'. 'I've seen my sister suffer with 23 years of pain and she has had more than 30 operations,' she said.

'Since having her second leg removed, she has gone from strength to strength.' For her amputation procedures, Lizzy was treated in Sheffield by orthopaedic surgeon Mr Michael Dennison, who she said 'has been brilliant'.

Lizzy's condition is called congenital bilateral talipes equinovaurus, more commonly known as 'club feet'. 

She will be given two sets of prosthetic legs by the NHS, one for everyday use, plus a pair of blades for running or sports. She is also planning to raise money for special prosthetic leg covers, which are not available on the NHS.
