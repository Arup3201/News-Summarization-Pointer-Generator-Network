Chances are good there’s poop in your pool.

A study from the Centers for Disease Control was recently released and shows that over half of public pools are swimming with fecal matter.

After testing 161 public pools in the Atlanta, Georgia area in the summer of 2012, the study found that 58 percent contained genetic material from the Escherichia coli.

Murky issue: The CDC says over 50 percent of public pools are likely contaminated with fecal matter

It’s a bacteria most people know as E. coli. And what does E. coli mean?

You guessed it! It means poo.

The study, undertaken by the CDC’s Healthy Swimming Program, indicated that ‘Escherichia coli, a fecal indicator, was detected in 93 (58 percent) samples; detection signifies that swimmers introduced fecal material into pool water.’

You read right. Not only is your pool just a giant toilet, but it’s all your fault and you might not even know you’re doing it.

The CDC wrote that ‘formed fecal incidents,’ as it calls them, aren’t the problem. Instead, the e. coli is introduced from the nether regions of swimmers who neglect to shower before taking a dip.

‘The average person has about .14 grams of feces on their rear end,’ Michele Hlavsa, who led the study, told NBC. ‘If that rinses off into the water, the amount from one person might not be that much. But as more and more swimmers introduce it that much, it does become an issue.’

Hlavsa all that introduced material can really pile up.

‘Let’s imagine 1,000 kids go to a water park. They have as much as 10 grams of feces on their rear ends,’ she said.  ‘We are now talking about 10,000 grams or 10 kg. That translates to 24 pounds of poop in the water.’

And though all public pools must 
maintain specified levels of disinfectants in order to stem illnesses 
caused by such contamination, Hlavsa said it may not always be enough.

‘Chlorine and other disinfectants don’t kill germs instantly,’ said Hlavsa said, adding that proper hygiene is the only to prevent the fecal contamination of pools.

Hlavsa says between 20 and 80 outbreaks of disease caused by swimming pools are reported each year.

In addition to the ‘fecal indicator’ bacteria, many of the pools in the study also tested positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosabacteria, a bacteria capable of giving swimmers rashes and ear infections.

The study said it was unclear if the Pseudomonas aeruginosabacteria came from people or if it was introduced to the pools from the surrounding environment. It was found in 59 percent of the tested pools.

Hlavsa doesn’t want to dissuade anyone from swimming. She calls it an excellent form of exercise. One she even says she’ll be doing as soon as the weather permits in Atlanta.

Nonetheless, she took a hard line on the issue.

‘It is time to stop treating the swimming pool as a toilet,’ Hlavsa said. ‘Nowhere else except for the pool is it acceptable to poop in public or pee in public. In other places if we did this in public, we’d be arrested.’
