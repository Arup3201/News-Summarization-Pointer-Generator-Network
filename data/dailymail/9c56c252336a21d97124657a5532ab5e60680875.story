Gunmen stormed celebrity hot spot BOA restaurant in West Hollywood and made off with up to $8,000 in cash, reports claim.

Two attackers allegedly walked through the back entrance unobstructed at the end of service at 2am on Friday.

The eatery is famed for its nightly list of A-list diners, who flock for a low key night out.

According to TMZ, the thieves accosted the general managers as they sorted the night's accounts.

A spokesman for LAPD said the department is as yet unaware of the incident.  

BOA Steakhouse opened its West Hollywood branch in 2009, prompting an almost instant influx of celebrity diners.

Diners glam up for an evening at BOA, which serves a lunch menu, a dinner party, and a gluten-free menu. 

Dishes include goats cheese baklava drizzled in honey, tuna tartare, and surf n' turf.

Champagne flows.

Last night, diners included Nicki Minaj, Jamie Foxx, and Floyd Mayweather. Earlier, Kanye West dropped by for lunch.
