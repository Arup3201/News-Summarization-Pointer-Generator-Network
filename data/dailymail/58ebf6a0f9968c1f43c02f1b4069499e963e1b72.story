Roy Hodgson refers to the void between England’s 2-1 defeat against Uruguay on June 19 and Thursday's squad announcement as ‘post-World Cup depression’.

The rest of the country, those poor souls who watched as England were knocked out before 12 teams had even played their second group game, were diagnosed at the same time.

Thursday was billed as ‘The Rooney Press Conference’ at which the head coach explained why the Manchester United striker has succeeded Steven Gerrard as captain.

Good for Wayne Rooney, who has never made any secret of his desire to lead from the front, but there are more pressing matters to address.

First things first. Hodgson declared: ‘Don’t try to make me out to be some complete fool who, after getting knocked out in the first round of the World Cup, says we are as good as the team who won it.’

If only he had been this spiky when the writing was on the wall at the World Cup after Mario Balotelli’s 50th-minute header sealed a 2-1 victory for Italy in Manaus.

Hodgson must raise his game. He claims to have an identity in mind, a plan to play just like Germany — or better — as he starts out on the lengthy qualification campaign towards Euro 2016.

He has reconstructed the squad, rightly bringing in Calum Chambers after the defender’s outstanding start to his career with Arsenal.

‘I spoke to Arsene Wenger to ask him if it was too early and he said “no, take him”,’ said Hodgson.

Danny Rose, Jack Colback and Fabian Delph are the other newbies in the group ahead of next Wednesday’s friendly with Norway at Wembley and the Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland on September 8.

‘Germany have very good players and they started with these young players,’ said Hodgson. ‘Bastian Schweinsteiger at 18 wasn’t the player he is today and Philipp Lahm wasn’t. If we work hard and develop our players there is nothing to stop us producing these type of players and playing the same sort of football.’

So, now that Germany are champions of the world, we are going to play like them. It was inevitable, but we had to hear it from Hodgson to be certain. When England lost 1-0 to Germany in their own back yard last November, Toni Kroos had no fewer than 125 touches of the ball in midfield. Over to you, Colback.

With Euro 2016 qualifiers against Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, San Marino and Lithuania over the next 18 months, Hodgson has time to convince a sceptical audience.

‘The qualifying group looks relatively easy so we can only hope that the chance to play in those qualifiers, plus getting games in club football, will in two years make them better players,’ said Hodgson. ‘I am not blaming any of the clubs for sometimes not using these players. The 19 or 20-year-old with great potential is having to fight competition from a 27-year-old Brazilian or Argentinian international with 75 caps. That’s the situation.

‘They may even develop some leadership qualities. You don’t develop them without playing.

‘If working with a younger team with potential costs us leaders, I can’t wave the magic wand and bring back a leader in defence, with one or two in midfield and up front.

‘I believe in the squad and I think they are going to be good enough. In 2016 we will see a good England team and I am entitled to believe that.’

Let’s hold Hodgson to this because no-one can sit through another lame England performance at a major tournament.

He retains the full support of the FA and maintains that he never came close to resigning after England finished bottom of Group D at the World Cup with a single point. He said: ‘When you have the backing of your employers and you have a contract and you have the backing of the people you are working with I don’t see any reason not to carry on.’

To Hodgson’s credit, he takes full responsibility for the failings of the national team in Brazil. ‘I accept all of those things,’ he added. Next week, in front of around 50,000 England fans, Hodgson must lift the mood of the nation with a bracing performance against Norway.

‘I can’t expect people to shrug it off, but I’m hoping it won’t be too evident that the apathy exists,’ he added. ‘I am hoping the public gets behind the team because the team needs them. ‘We have to get on the field, put this shirt on and play well. I want them to think “this team is worth following”.’

As Hodgson knows, it has been a long time since anybody has been able to say that.
