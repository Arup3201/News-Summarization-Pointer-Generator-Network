Career saved: Brett Winstanley won the British Open Clay Pigeon Shooting Championship earlier this year after laser eye surgery

When Brett Winstanley won the British Open Clay Pigeon Shooting Championship earlier this year, it marked an extraordinary comeback.

Although the marksman was only 24 when he clinched the title, he hadn’t competed for six years because his deteriorating eyesight had forced him to give up the sport.

 But following successful laser surgery, Brett is now back in the game and even hoping to compete in the 2016 Olympics in Rio.

He suffered from short-sightedness, which occurs when the eyes keep growing and become too long from front to back. 

This means that light doesn’t reach the light-sensitive tissue (retina) at the back of the eye but focuses too early, so distant objects become blurred.

‘When you are shooting, good hand-to-eye co-ordination is essential,’ explains Brett. ‘And you need excellent sight.

‘My father used to shoot and I would watch him. When I was six, he let me have a go. I swiftly overtook him, and by the age of nine I was shooting competitively.’

His early success was quite extraordinary. Aged 12, he was in the England team and also won his first sub-junior world championship in Miami.

But the following year, Brett’s vision in his right eye started to deteriorate. ‘It wasn’t catastrophic, but I had to retrain for six months. I had previously shot left-handed, and I changed hands.’

However, by the time he reached 16, his eyesight was even worse. 

He went to an optician and was given glasses to wear – but he hated using them for shooting. ‘I found that I got glare from the targets, and I couldn’t wear safety glasses over the top,’ Brett says. 

‘I struggled enough with glasses to know that I couldn’t deal with contact lenses. What had been effortless became extremely difficult and stopped being fun. I later decided that shooting wasn’t for me and turned my attention to car racing instead.’

His parents were understandably disappointed, and a year ago Brett’s father suggested he have laser eye surgery to rectify the short-sightedness.

Brett was wary about the reported risks – indeed last week Spice Girl Mel B revealed she is going blind in her left eye following a procedure 15 years ago, and is now planning to have a cornea transplant to correct her vision.

But Bruce Allan, a consultant surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says better techniques and technology means laser surgery is much safer than it was 20 years ago.

‘I have many more contact lens wearers turning up in my clinic with serious eye infections than I do laser patients,’ he says.

 ‘Surgery is very safe as along as you have it carried out in the right place with an experienced surgeon.’ 

In March, Brett met ophthalmic surgeon Faqir Qazi at the Optical Express Treatment Centre in Manchester, who explained what would happen with a procedure known as LASIK – Laser-Assisted-In-Situ-Keratomileusis eye surgery. This uses two computer-guided lasers.

Brett describes the procedure as no worse than having a tooth extracted. ‘During the second part all I could see was the orange light of the laser and I could hear a sort of popping sound. It was so straightforward.’

After his successful comeback Brett was given a new gun by his sponsors – gun makers Caesar Guerini – and now has his sights set firmly on Rio. ‘I’m really going for gold. I don’t aim for anything less when I’m shooting,’ he says.

iDesign iLASIK treatment is from £1,895 per eye, opticalexpress.co.uk
