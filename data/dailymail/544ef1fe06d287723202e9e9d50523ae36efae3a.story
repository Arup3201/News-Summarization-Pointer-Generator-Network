House Speaker John Boehner on Thursday starkly warned President Barack Obama that if he meddles in the immigration system and issues an executive order granting millions of illegals amnesty, he'll sorely regret it.

'When you play with matches, you take the risk of burning yourself,' Boehner said today at a Washington, D.C. press conference. 'And he's going to burn himself if he continues to go down this path.'

The GOP leader was responding to Obama's commitment on Wednesday 'to take whatever lawful actions' he can to make changes to the deportation process - with or without the permission of Congress - before the end of the year.

No more Mr. Nice Guy: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio told reporters today during a Capitol Hill  press conference that Obama would live to regret acting alone on immigration reform

'I've consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill,' Obama said during a press conference on Wednesday. 'I think it's fair to say that I've shown a lot of patience and tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible and will keep doing so.'

But in the absence of congressional action, Obama again promised to make his own reforms. The president has not said what moves he's considering, but White House officials have indicated that anywhere between one and 11 million illegal immigrants could be allowed to stay in the U.S. as a direct result. 

Challenging Boehner, Obama said on Wednesday, 'You send me a bill that I can sign and those executive actions go away. 

'What we can't do is just keep on waiting,' he argued. 'There's a cost for waiting.'

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is slated to become Majority Leader of the Senate in January, said Wednesday that Obama was taking the wrong approach to altering the nation's broken immigration system.

'I think the president choosing to do a lot of things unilaterally on immigration would be a big mistake,' McConnell told reporters during a press conference out of Kentucky, where he had just been reelected to his Senate seat the night before.

'It's an issue that most of my members want to address legislatively and it's like waving a red flag in front of a bull to say, "If you guys don't do what I want, I'm going to do it on my own."

'I hope he won't do that because I do think it poisons the well for the opportunity to address a very important domestic issue,' McConnell said.

Boehner reiterated McConnell's observation on Thursday, saying if Obama acts on his own will to 'poison the well' for broader reforms to the immigration process 'and there will be no chance for immigration reform moving in this Congress. 

'The American people made it clear Election Day, they want to get things done, and they don't want the president acting on a unilateral basis,' Boehner said. 

The House Speaker, who has long said he's in favor of reforming the immigration system in a step-by-step fashion rather than the president's preferred comprehensive method, said he was doing his best to come up with a package that all parties involved could agree to. 

'I could regale you with all of my challenges of trying to get members on both sides of the aisle to deal with this. They were numerous. But hope springs eternal,' he said.

Not bluffing: President Barack Obama recommitted on Wednesday to saving millions of illegal immigrants from deportation by issuing an executive order giving them work permits

The Republican legislator signaled on Thursday that the post-election Kumbaya between the White House and Republicans, at least as far as he is concerned, is already over, just two days after the midterm election that gave his party a historic number of seats in Congress.

'My job is not to get along with the president, just to get along with him, although we actually have a nice relationship,' Boehner told reproters today. 'My job is to listen to my members and listen to the American people and make their priorities our priorities.'

At today's presser and in an op-ed with McConnell that appeared in today's Wall Street Journal Boehner made it clear that chief among his concerns is getting rid of the health care reform law.

'The American people have made it clear they are not for ObamaCare,' Boehner said today. 'Ask all those Democrats who lost their elections Tuesday. A lot of them voted for ObamaCare.'

Realistically, Republicans have no shot in Hades of getting the president to sign off on a repeal of Obamacare. However, Boehner waved off the critical point as irrelevant today.

'Just because we might not be able to get everything we want doesn't mean we shouldn't try to get what we can,' Boehner contended.

'There are bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate to take some of these issues out of ObamaCare. We need to put them on the president's desk and let him choose,' the Ohio representative said. 

As Boehner was pledging on Capitol Hill to stand his ground on Obamacare and other issues key to the GOP's agenda, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was assuring reporters at his daily briefing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue that the president is dedicated to finding 'common ground' with Republicans in Congress.

The president looks forward to meeting with Boehner and other congressional leaders for lunch tomorrow at the White House, Earnest said, suggesting that a new era of bipartisanship could be on the way in Washington.

Boehner seemed suspicious on Thursday at his own briefing, across town, that the Democratic president actually intends to compromise with Republicans.

'Finding common ground is going to be hard work, but it will be even harder if the president isn’t willing to work with us,' Boehner said.
