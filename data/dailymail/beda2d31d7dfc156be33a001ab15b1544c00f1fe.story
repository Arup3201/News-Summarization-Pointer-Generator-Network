When the world was first introduced to Wonky the puppy earlier this month, she cut a pitiful figure.

The little Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross was given the unusual name because of 
severe problems with her malformed front legs, which failed to develop after she was 
separated from her mother.

But now, after intense physiotherapy, the 12-week-old has quickly made a fantastic recovery.

Where once she walked awkwardly on bent joints, she can now bound along normally, her tail wagging as she goes.

WONKY TWO WEEKS AGO...

Wonky, disabled by malformed joints, was found dumped on a street in Leeds earlier this month

... AND AS SHE IS NOW

Since being treated with physio, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross has made remarkable progress at the Dogs Trust

Staff at the trust have also given the 12-week-old a new name - Juliette

And staff at the Dogs Trust in Leeds, where she is being treated, have also given her a new name - Juliette.

John Wannop, a vet at the centre, told how the puppy was taken there on February 9 with contracted flexor tendons on the back of her front legs - leading to a condition known as 'knuckling'.

Knuckling of the carpal joints is caused by contraction of the tendons which prevents the wrist joint 
from extending fully - and meant her front feet bended inwards because her 
tendons were too short.

He said that without treatment, it would have been impossible for Juliette to straighten her legs.

She was found wandering the streets as a stray and was brought to the Dogs Trust by a member of the public.

Because of her unorthodox looks, there had been concern she would struggle to find a new home.

In fact, 600 people have so far applied to give Juliette a home, and staff are still sifting through applications.

Amanda Sands, manager at the trust, said: 'She's had a very tough start in life. She was taken from 
her mother too early and was then having to fend for herself on the 
streets at just nine weeks old.

'She isn't a traditionally pretty pooch but she's a lovely girl with a great character.

With further physiotherapy, Mr Wannop said the prognosis for Juliette is good

Because of her unorthodox looks, staff were concerned she would struggle to find a new home - but 600 people have applied to look after her. Above, Juliette finds her feet during her rehabilitation

'We
really hope people can see beyond appearances and someone can give her 
the fresh start she deserves - a new home where she'll be loved and 
cared for.'

With further physiotherapy, the prognosis for Juliette is good.

And since the trust wants her kept under review, it would prefer her to be rehoused in Leeds.

'It's such a sad case because this was completely preventable if only she'd had the right love and care,' Ms Sands said.

'She had not had the right supplements to enable her to grow properly and so her front legs were too weak.

'We
don't know everything about her background but we think that she was 
removed from her mother too early and was then abandoned. She had not 
had the right nutrition and a poor diet meant her front legs were underdeveloped.'

She added: 'Physiotherapy will really help to strengthen her muscles. We have
to stretch her legs into a straight position 30 times twice a day.

'It's such a sad case because this was completely preventable if only she'd had the right love and care,' said Amanda Sands, manager at the trust

'She will need regular trips to the specialist vet to keep a track of her progress.

'With
the right treatment, she will hopefully be able to live a normal life 
and do all the things a puppy should be able to enjoy.

Staff are looking for owners 
who can continue her physiotherapy - with costs supplemented by Dogs 
Trust.

It is the UK's largest dog welfare charity and cares for more than 16,000 stray and abandoned dogs each year through its network of 18
Rehoming Centres across the UK and one in Dublin.

Amanda Francis
spokesman for the charity said: 'Usually, physical deformity is the 
result of unscrupulous breeders or they haven't been properly looked 
after and most of the time it's something that is completely 
preventable.'
