The half-brother of a leading Tory MP was arrested yesterday by detectives investigating historic allegations of child abuse.

Charles Napier, 65, was held when officers swooped at his mother’s home in Sherborne, Dorset.

His half-brother, John Whittingdale MP, is chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee.

Napier was questioned as part of Operation Fairbank, a Scotland Yard inquiry into claims that a VIP paedophile ring operated in London more than three decades ago with links to Peter Righton, a notorious paedophile who is now dead.

Former ministers, MPs,  senior police officers and men with links to the royal household are alleged to have indecently assaulted boys in care homes.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
