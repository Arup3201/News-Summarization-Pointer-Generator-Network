The media were banned from entering the FIFA ExCo hotel in Marrakech after the BBC started filming in the lobby, but the German TV station which did gain access later may be a lot more troublesome.

It was German station ARD — who have just revealed a serial doping culture in Russian athletics that has caused tremors within track and field’s ruling body, the IAAF — and they had two of their top officials operating inside La Mamounia hotel.

ARD, who have the International Olympic Comittee, the World Anti-Doping Agency and the IAAF all mounting probes into the drugs allegations, are planning a documentary about FIFA and the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.

The central figure within the ARD probe is expected to be German legend Franz Beckenbauer, the former FIFA ExCo member who remains under investigation by FIFA for alleged breaches of ethics codes in the bidding process.

Beckenbauer initially refused to speak to the Garcia investigation before changing his mind.

He has had close links with the Russian bid team since the campaign in 2010 when Sports Agenda first mooted he would become an ambassador of Russian energy giants Gazprom. They have since become major sponsors in football.

The biggest surprise in Michael Garcia’s resignation statement was his astonishing claim that the FIFA ExCo had reported him to the disciplinary committee for supposedly breaking ethics codes by speaking out that his report should be made public.

Clare Balding’s weekly chat show on BT Sport, which attracts paltry viewing figures despite huge promotion, could be sold to BBC. 

Talks are understood to be at an advanced stage for a 30-minute version of the programme featuring Balding to be aired on BBC2 on Friday evenings.

FIFA’s Club World Cup fails to register in the UK even when Real Madrid — with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale part of a full strength side — are playing in today’s final. 

However, FIFA’s individual Ballon d’Or is regarded by the world’s best players as definitely worth winning.

Gill needs training up

The FIFA circus in Marrakech this week has seen British vice-president Jim Boyce inundated with media requests which the affable Northern Ireland football administrator always does his best to accommodate — even waiting for 40 minutes while Channel 4 tried to sort out an interview link from London yesterday.

Certainly, England’s David Gill, almost sure to replace Boyce after the UEFA Congress election in March, will have to change his typical anti-Press attitude and needs media training to prepare him for the role.

Rio Ferdinand’s ever-increasing media profile has been enough to persuade Robbie Savage to join him in the management stable of Jamie Moralee, the former Watford player still unkindly described by fan groups as the club’s worst-ever signing.

The FA board were remarkably sanguine at their meeting this week about the commercial department’s abject failure to find a sponsor for the FA Cup by the third round.

Sympathy of the sort shown by the FA directors about the difficult market conditions certainly would not have been seen at Daniel Levy–run White Hart Lane, where heads tend to roll in the Tottenham Hotspur commercial department for failure to achieve targets.

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is known to be rather more cut-throat than the Football Association seem to be

It is expected that the upcoming Premier League TV rights bonanza, that could reap an astonishing near £5billion from the domestic market with a £10million-a-game valuation, will galvanise campaigning about lowering the price of match tickets. 

The Premier League, despite all the billions coming into the coffers from television contracts, still need full stadiums to sell the product. 

There can be no reason whatsoever after the jackpot rights deals are announced in February for ticket prices at all Premier Leage clubs not to come down.
