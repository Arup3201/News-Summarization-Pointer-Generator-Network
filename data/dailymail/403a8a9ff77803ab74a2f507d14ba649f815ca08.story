Jonjo Shelvey made a young boy' dreams come true, by putting up the seven-year-old and his family in a Swansea hotel before inviting the child to be a mascott at Swansea.

Londoner Harry Jacobs suffers from Alopecia totalis, the same condition that the Swansea midfielder has, causing both to lose their hair from a young age.

And, when Harry wrote to the 22-year-old midfielder, Shelvey immediately wanted to help.

'I know what it was like for me growing up as a boy with Alopecia,' he explained. 'It was quite tough for me with people calling me names and things.'

The boy from Muswell Hill had written to Shelvey inviting him to his school in north London and asking the Premier League star what he thought of the condition.

'You are amazing and scored a goal from 47 yards into the top corner,' wrote Harry. 'So, so, so good.

'I know you play for Swansea. My name is Harry and I have Alopecia like you. Do you like it? I think it is medium because I can't get nits and don't have to go to the hairdressers – which is good. I don't really like it though.

Shelvey said he felt for Harry having grown up with the same hair-loss condition as a child

'Can you come to my school please, but first to my house. I can take you to school then to meet my friends.'

The former Liverpool player said he was only too glad to help, providing a hotel for Harry and his family as well as executive tickets and the chance to be an official Swansea mascott. 

'I felt for Harry when I got the letter,' he said. 'It was nice for me to share some of my experiences with him and to try and guide him along the right lines.

'The best bit though was seeing the look on his face walking out with the team. He said he had a great time – and that's so special.' 

'He said he had a great time – and that's so special,' said former Liverpool midfielder Shelvey
