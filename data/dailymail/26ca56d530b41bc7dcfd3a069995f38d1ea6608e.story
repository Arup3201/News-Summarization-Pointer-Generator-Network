Watching television for more than two hours a day increases the risk of raised blood pressure in children, warns a study.

Those aged two to ten were 30 per cent more likely to have high blood pressure than youngsters who spent less time in front of a TV or computer screen.

Lack of physical activity increased the risk even more – by 50 per cent – scientists found in the project covering 5,221 children in eight European countries.

Lead researcher Dr Augusto Cesar de Moraes, from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, said: 'The study shows the number of new high blood pressure cases and the connection between physical activity and different sedentary behaviours with the risk of high blood pressure.'

He warned that the condition can cause cardiovascular problems later in life. 'For example, it increases the risk of ischemic heart disease,' he said.

Over two years, a high incidence of elevated blood pressure was seen in the children – 110 cases per 1,000.

In the International Journal of Cardiology, researchers concluded: 'The figures are worrying, given that sedentary behaviours are common in infancy and subsequently, later in life.'

A child's blood pressure is not a specific measurement but is seen as high if it is above that of 95 per cent of those of the same age, height and gender.
