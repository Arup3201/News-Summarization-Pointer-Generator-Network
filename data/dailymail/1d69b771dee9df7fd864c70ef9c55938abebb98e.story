Detectives have arrested a 39-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a man fell more than 80ft to his death from a block of flats last night.

A man in his early 30s died in the early hours of this morning after falling from the eighth floor of the Paradise House tower block in the Foleshill area of Coventry.

He had been found lying injured by a passer by at around 11.20pm.

Although he was taken to hospital, he died shortly after midnight.

A man was arrested on suspicion of murder after handing himself into police this morning.

The area around the flats remained cordoned off today while detectives carried out a forensics search and made door to door enquiries.

West Midlands Police Superintendent Nick Walton said: 'We're still in the very early stages of this investigation and our enquiries to understand exactly what happened are ongoing.

'I want to reassure people that this is being treated as an isolated incident and we now have a named suspect in custody.

'But we are still keen to hear from any witnesses or anyone who may be able to help us piece together the events of yesterday evening.

'We are treating this death as suspicious and are actively following up several lines of enquiry today.

'Perhaps you saw the man drop from the flat or heard a disturbance in the moments before or after he fell - please speak to officers at the scene or give us a call.'

Anyone with information should contact West Midlands Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
