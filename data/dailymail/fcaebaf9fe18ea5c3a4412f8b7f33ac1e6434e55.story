This is the jaw-dropping moment a group of daredevils walk the tight roped hundreds of metres above the ground between colossal cliffs.

On March 6, local and international members of the highlining community ascended Mount Victoria in the Blue Mountains, 80 km west of Sydney, for a weekend of death-defying walks at heights between 60 to 100 metres in the air.

The past time involves fixing a one-inch thick rope between two mountains and walking in between them, sometimes with no safety equipment whatsoever.

While most people are confident walking on a rope low to the ground, the mental hurdle of doing so from a heart-stopping height coupled with the environmental variables such as sudden gusts of wind makes it vastly more challenging.

Sydney-based electrician Luke Sarantos (pictured) said highlining was the opposite of thrill-seeking: ‘It’s actually very peaceful and soothing when you feel the wind on your face and feel yourself in free space'

But Sydney based electrician Luke Sarantos, who took part in the event, told Daily Mail Australia highlining is the opposite of thrill-seeking.

‘It’s actually very peaceful and soothing when you feel the wind on your face and feel yourself in free space. In a way it’s like the opposite of thrillseeking.’

Sarantos said the gathering, which was organised on social media, drew in over 70 experienced and novice highliners from across Australia and the world.

‘It went off without a hitch. There were guys from all across Australia, and even some from France and Canada. You can tell the community is gaining traction,’ he said.

The meet-up saw seven highlines used ranging from 8 metres 95 metres in length, anchored at heights ranging from 60 metres to 100 metres in the air.

But despite walking above what most would see as horrifying heights, Sarantos said it is an 'extremely safe sport.'

‘I won’t get on a skateboard or even play football because I find those are too dangerous. Every safety mechanism in highlining has a backup and you can’t physically fall on to anything off the line.’

Highlining is an extreme form of slackroping which sees participants walk between two anchor points set up with enormous elevation from the ground or water, sometimes with no safety equipment whatsoever

He claims he has never witnessed a significant injury and there have never any deaths in the sport.

Sarantos said he has been highlining for about four years, and while it’s easy to pick the sport up, it becomes increasingly difficult once you progress beyond a novice level.

‘Once you reach ropes 60 metres in length or more, it gets incredibly difficult,’ he said. 

Safety is paramount with numerous safety harnesses and procedures used to maintain a well measured and safe environment

The crowd of 70 that gathered for the event shared a similar passion for adventure and the outdoors
