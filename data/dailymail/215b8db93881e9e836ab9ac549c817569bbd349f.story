Luis Suarez has turned up at Liverpool's training ground on transfer deadline day... but the £75million Barcelona star is only there to clear out his locker.

The 27-year-old striker arrived with a cheeky gift for Steven Gerrard - a Barca shirt with his name and number on it - and the Liverpool skipper put the picture on his Instagram account.

It was accompanied by the message: 'He is back bearing gifts emotional saying goodbye to the main man this morning best wishes to a phenomenal player.'

Gerrard presumably was able to hide the disappointment he feels at Suarez's departure.

In an interview with Sky Sports over the weekend he said: 'I thought he was going to stay, I thought we'd have got another year out of him.

'I was actually already on the floor when I saw the bite because we knew we were going out. It was a double blow, knowing you're going out of the World Cup and knowing you're going to lose your best player.

'I knew there was no way back for him then and I knew he was going to engineer a way out.' 

Suarez later tweeted himself, posting: 'Today I could say goodbye to some friends, it was exciting to remember the good moments that we lived together.' 

He also posted a picture of himself with Gerrard, Glen Johnson and Jon Flanagan.

Suarez has not yet played for Barcelona because of his four-month ban for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.
