An Orthodox rabbi was shot dead as he walked to a Miami temple, in what his daughter is calling a hate crime.

Police and Jewish community leaders believe the incident, which left 60-year-old Joseph Raksin dead, was part of a botched robbery, and had no religious incentive.

But Mr Raksin's daughter, Shully Lepokovski, told WSVN.com: 'I believe it was a hate crime, simply because he was a Jew.'

According to the Miami Herald, on July 28, police reported that swastikas were spray-painted on the front pillars of a Northeast Miami-Dade synagogue, amid the ongoing conflict over Gaza, leading to concerns the shooting may be linked.

Brian Siegal, director of the American Jewish Committee's Miami and Broward Regional Office, told the Herald: 'Our deepest condolences to the [Raksin] family for this tragic loss. We are confident the police will take the matter seriously and will give them time to investigate.

'Coming so soon and so close to the synagogue that was vandalized last week with swastikas and pro-Hamas graffiti, obviously we're suspicious that it's linked, but that remains to be seen.'

Fellow rabbis turned out to mourn Mr Raksin, who his daughter believes was the victim of hate crime

The Brooklyn, New York rabbi, who is a father-of-six and was in Florida visiting his two daughters and grandchildren, was walking along Northeast 175th Street and Eighth Court around 9am on Saturday, when two men approached him.

Police said there was an altercation before Mr Raksin was shot, but Yona Lunger, a Jewish community activist, said he spoke to a witness who told him he was shot immediately by one of the men. He was airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where he later died.

Police said Mr Raksin was heading to Bais Menachem Chabad, a synagogue just a few blocks away, as it was the Sabbath, an important day of religious observance for Orthodox Jews.

The Anti-Defamation League says it has been in close contact with lead investigators and the crime appears to be a robbery gone badly

Miami-Dade police spokeswoman Elena Hernandez says there is no indication that the shooting was a hate crime.

Authorities have not released a motive, but the Anti-Defamation League says it has been in close contact with lead investigators and the crime appears to be a robbery gone badly.

Orthodox Jews do not carry and money or possessions with them on the Sabbath, as it is their holy day. 

The incident has left the neighbourhood and Miami's Jewish community shaken. Joseph Waks, a friend of Mr Raksin and his family, told WSVN.com: 'This has a big effect in the community. A rabbi [shot] walking to temple. I've got two beautiful children. I walk to temple with them every Sabbath in Miami Beach. It's devastating.'

Police are searching for two young suspects. One was apparently on a bicycle and the other on foot. It it believed they fired just one shot before fleeing the scene.

A witness described one of the men to be wearing a yellow shirt, and the other an orange shirt. The community is offering a $50,000 reward for information that helps lead to an arrest. 

The funeral was today at 10am today at Shomrei Haddas on 13 Ave. in Borough Park, with the procession passing Chabad headquarters on 770 Eastern Parkway at around 10.45am.
