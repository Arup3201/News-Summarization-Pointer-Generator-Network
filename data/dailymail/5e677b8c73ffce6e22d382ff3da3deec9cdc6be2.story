Suzanne MacCrimmon has earned the title of Incredible Shrinking Bridesmaid after her embarrassment at her appearance in several friends' wedding photos saw her lose seven stone (98lbs).  

When Suzanne  saw herself in her first bridesmaid's dress, she was horrified at how overweight she looked in the size 24 dress, weighing more than 19 stone (266 pounds).

The photos inspired her to lose two stone in time for her next bridesmaid role.  

When Suzanne MacCrimmon from Alloa in saw herself in her first bridesmaid's dress, she was horrified at how overweight she looked in the size 24 dress. She has since dropped six dress sizes over three years and three more weddings 

By the time she was a bridesmaid at a third wedding in September 2011, she had slimmed down to a size 18. 

When Suzanne was asked to be a bridesmaid for a fourth time at her best friend’s wedding, she had successfully slimmed down to a size 14.

The 34-year-old from Alloa in the Central Lowlands of Scotland has now lost more than seven stone, going from 19st 4lbs (270lbs)  to 12st 3lbs (171lbs), and has gone down six dress sizes. 

Thanks to her weight loss she has won a slimming award - and was even accompanied to the awards ceremony by the four brides who were so instrumental in her weight loss.

Suzanne said: ‘The worst moment was when I went shopping for that first bridesmaid's dress.

‘It was for my brother’s wedding in 2009 and I’d ordered a dress in a small size as I’d convinced myself that I was going to lose weight in time. But when the dress arrived I couldn’t get into it.

‘Thankfully my sister in law was fabulous about it and we found another dress that was ideal. But when I saw myself in the photos I could see how large I looked and I knew that I had to do something about my weight.’

After wedding number two, Suzanne decided to join her local Scottish Slimmers group and changed her eating habits to try and increase her weight loss 

Suzanne, who then weighed 19st 4lbs (270lbs) and was a size 24, joined a gym and managed to lose two stone before one of her friends asked her to be a bridesmaid again.

She said: ‘The bridal shops didn’t have any sample dresses in my size so I went along with the strapless style that the other bridesmaids had chosen.

‘I didn’t feel comfortable in the dress but I just got on with it.’

After wedding number two, Suzanne decided to join her local Scottish Slimmers group and changed her eating habits to try and increase her weight loss. 

She had a good reason to join as she had just been asked to be bridesmaid number three at another friend’s wedding in September 2011.

Suzanne was asked to be bridesmaid number three at another friend’s wedding in September 2011 and wore a size 18 dress 

She said: ‘This time I was determined to lose more weight before I fitted into my third bridesmaid’s dress. I had lost two stone for the second wedding, and I wanted to lose even more for wedding number three.

‘I decided to order a dress in a smaller size. I know it had proven to be a fiasco at my brother’s wedding but this time I was in a slimming club and knew that I had the support to lose the weight I needed to.

Suzanne ditched her bad eating habits and instead ate healthily and managed to lose more weight.

She said: ‘This time I bought a size 18 dress managed to lose another three stone (42lbs) before the wedding. 

'The dress was absolutely beautiful and I felt much better about what I looked like .’

Suzanne has now lost a total of seven stone (98lbs) 

She had only just packed away the third bridesmaid’s dress when she was asked to a bridesmaid again, this time at her best friend Sarah’s wedding.

Suzanne managed to lose even more weight by the time she slipped into her yellow bridesmaid dress for the wedding in April 2012 , weighing a much slimmer 13st (182lbs).

She said: ‘It was a beautiful yellow dress. I’d ordered it in a size 16, and it was actually too big for me on the day.

‘I do feel as though I’ve had a massive achievement. 

'When I look back at the bridesmaid dresses I’ve worn and how I’ve got smaller at each wedding, it feels amazing.’

She has since lost more weight and has now lost a total of seven stone (98lbs).

Suzanne's weight loss has been recognised by an award from Scottish Slimmers and her four brides accompanied her to the awards ceremony, which took place in October 

She added: ‘Not only do my clothes feel so much better but I feel so much healthier now too. 

'I managed to climb Ben Nevis in a pair of size 12 trousers that I had borrowed from a friend, and that was a great feeling.

‘I’ve got so much more energy and I’ve also done a sky dive too - something that I would have never done before.’

And her weight loss has also been recognised by an award from Scottish Slimmers. And her four brides accompanied her to the awards ceremony, which took place in October.

She said: ‘It was great to have them all with me - they played such a part in my weight loss.’
