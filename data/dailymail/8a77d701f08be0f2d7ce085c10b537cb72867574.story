President Obama’s is on something of a congressional charm offensive as he took part in a bipartisan game of golf on Monday afternoon.

Obama, an avid golfer with a respectable 17 handicap, rarely takes politics to the greens.

Senators Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) and Mark Udall (D-Colo.) joined Obama, who usually plays golf with aides or friends from Chicago.

On the green: President Barack Obama with Senator Mark Udall, D-Colo. on the golf course at Andrews Air Force Base

Obama, who has the highest handicap in the group, teamed up with Udall, who has the lowest.

The president, in a white baseball cap, navy blue zip up jacket and dark khakis, chipped his first shot past the hole. He later missed a putt.

They were beaten by Corker and Chambliss, aided by the Georgia senator’s hole in one on the 11th hole on the golf course at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.

Putting away: US President Barack Obama rarely takes politics onto the greens but The White House say he is determined to do 'whatever it takes' to get his second term agenda through

Chambliss hit a five iron 156 yards for a surprise hole in one on the 11th hole. The feat was the talk of Washington, but the Georgia Republican was modest about the shot.

'It was pretty special. The ball 
actually flew the route I wanted it to go,' Chambliss told reporters 
back at the Senate, after the game was cut short after 15 holes due to a
vote.

'I'm the luckiest guy in the 
world to have a hole in one. Anyone who says having a hole-in-one is 
skill, they're living in another world,' he said.

'The
president got it out of the hole and handed it to me, and then they 
brought the flag out later. He signed the flag, and everybody signed the
flag, and it was pretty neat,' said Chambliss, who has golfed for 40 
years, and has a 7.4 handicap.

'We
had a delightful day of golf with folks who enjoy playing the game. We 
talked some business, but it was mainly a day for everyone to get away 
from the office for a little while,' he added.

Both Republicans have both expressed some willingness to compromise with Democrats on a deal.

Obama
has waged bitter fights with Congress over how best to tame the deficit
and on proposed new gun control laws after December's school shooting 
in Newtown, Connecticut.

All smiles: President Barack Obama teams up with a group of bipartisan senators on the first hole of the golf course at Andrews Air Force Base. If only it was as easy in congress...

But the president has also been criticized for failing to work more closely with the Senate and House of Representatives.

He has responded in recent months by hosting dinners and lunches with 
small groups of lawmakers from both parties to try to find common ground
on issues.

Chambliss said 
the foursome did not discuss immigration reform, a top priority for 
Obama, which begins to wind its way through Congress this week.

Chambliss said the foursome talked 'a little bit' about the crisis in Syria, cybersecurity and fiscal issues.

Lucky guy: Senator Saxby Chambliss smiles as he talks to reporters about making a hole-in-one during a golf outing earlier in the day with President Barack Obama

Obama has golf diplomacy before and in 2011 he played with House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).

Obama
almost never golfs with members of Congress. Democrats have publicly 
and privately criticized the president for not forming better 
relationships with lawmakers.

'He’s willing to try anything,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters at the daily press briefing.

All
three of the senators who golfed Monday with Obama were ranked among 
the top 40 on Golf Digest's 2011 list of "Washington's Top 150 Golfers.
