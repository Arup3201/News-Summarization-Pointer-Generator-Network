A lucky driver has cheated death after a gas leak was sparked underneath his car which was hit by lightning, sparking a wild blaze.

The car was completely destroyed and residents in 10 homes surrounding Dryandra Street and Wattle Street in O'Connor North Canberra were evacuated on Wednesday morning.

Dramatic images captured by a local resident show the car completely engulfed in flames as firefighters battle to put them out, reports ABC.

Firefighter Danny Brighenti said it was unclear whether the car was parked or moving when the lightening struck.

'On arrival the person had got out of the vehicle, but the car was heavily involved in fire with the surrounding trees and bushes. They're not injured ... but the car is totally destroyed.'

The car burst into flames at about 7.50am during a brief thunderstorm. Firefighters were reportedly baffled by the blaze, which continued to reignite for about two hours.

'They believed there was a ruptured fuel tank which was causing the car to reignite,' Mr Brighenti said.

Firefighters eventually moved the car away when they realised a gas main had been ruptured, at which point they set up an exclusion zone.

Several trees were set ablaze as the fire continued to reignite.

The the leak was isolated at about 11:20am, when fire crews could leave the scene.  

According to emergency services the gas leak was approximately 70 centimetres underground.
