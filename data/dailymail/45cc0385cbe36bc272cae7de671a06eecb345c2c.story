Two people have been shot dead and three others injured after a gunman opened fire when a fight broke out at a restaurant on New Year's Eve.

Shots were fired on Monday evening at the Sports Corner Cafe in the Old Sacramento area of California but it was not clear whether the shooting took place in or outside of the restaurant, police said.

No details of the shooter have been released but Mayor Kevin Johnson tweeted today that there was 'no indication of any outstanding suspects'.

Celebration cut short: Police gather outside the Sports Corner Cafe in Sacramento, California after two people were shot dead and five wounded

Crowds who had gathered to enjoy New Year's Eve celebrations scattered as the shots rang out.

After the shooting, police took precautions by cancelling a fireworks show scheduled nearby for midnight.

An earlier fireworks show, attended by hundreds of families, had just ended around 9pm when the shooting took place, adding to the confusion.

The city's visitors bureau had expected as many as 40,000 people would attend the New Year's Eve celebration.

One witness told CBS: 'They had one person in an ambulance and one person in a cop car. I saw the gun in the hand. He was just screaming and shooting.'

Another bystander said that the weapon made a 'pop' noise and sounded like a Glock gun.
