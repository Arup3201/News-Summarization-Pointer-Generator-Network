The couple killed in a hit and run outside a branch of Asda were the parents of 15 children including The Voice finalist Mike Ward.  

Paula Jolly, 37, and 45-year-old Michael Ward - who had 15 children before them - died after they were struck by a car while crossing the road outside the supermarket in Hulme, Manchester.

Ms Jolly, a mother of five, was pronounced dead at the scene while Mr Ward died on Christmas Eve morning after being rushed to hospital in a critical condition. 

Mr Ward, from Broughton, Salford, leaves behind ten children, including his 24-year-old son Mike, who was a finalist on last year's series of BBC 1's The Voice.

Mobein Ali, 20, has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving and will appear at Manchester Magistrates Court today.

Collision: The scene of the fatal car crash near an Asda superstore in Hulme, Manchester, on Tuesday night

Two people dead: Paula Jolly, 37, and Michael Ward, 45, were crossing Princess Road at the junction of Greenheys Lane

Two women aged 19 and 47 and a 59-year-old man, who were also arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving have now been released on police bail. 

Mike Ward took part in the second series of the BBC talent search, singing as part of Tom Jones's team. Despite pairing up with his mentor Jones to sing Green Green Grass of Home, Mike was named as runner-up to winner Andrea Begley.

During his time on the show, Mike was known for singing country and western music, and was credited by the mentors for his efforts in getting the genre noticed in the UK.

The singer took to Twitter to express his shock at his father's death, posting a photograph of the pair together and writing: 'Can't believe I lost you today dad .. & you actually had hair .. Gonna miss you R.I.P.'

Ms Jolly, from Dudley, had been reunited with her family five months ago and was planning to spend Christmas with her loved ones for the first time in years. 

Ms Jolly's devastated mother Sylvia Duddle, 61, told the M.E.N: 'We were in contact again, it was like a fresh start. 

'She was supposed to be coming to one of my other daughter’s houses today and stay for Christmas. I’m absolutely devastated. I feel broken - like my heart has been ripped out.'

Ms Jolly also leaves behind five sisters, four brothers and a step-brother. 

Mr Ward's bereft sister Theresa McCoy said she was at her brother's side when he died.

Flashing lights: The two people were hit by a blue Vauxhall Corsa at about 10.15pm on Tuesday

The 47-year-old said: 'It doesn't feel real, we don't know what to think yet. He would have been in here having a Christmas drink with us. I can't believe he's gone.' 

The incident took place as the couple were crossing Princess Road at the junction of Greenheys Lane outside an Asda superstore at about 10.15pm yesterday. Both were hit by a blue Vauxhall Corsa. 

Mr Ward died at 10.45am today while being treated at Manchester Royal Infirmary. 

Paramedics had been unable to save Ms Jolly - and a witness described on social media how this was despite their best efforts.

Gemma Partington said: ‘Saw the paramedics working so hard to save the lady's life last night at the side of the road. Very sad to hear she didn't make it. RIP. Wishing the man a full recovery.’

Pc Paul Joynson, from Greater Manchester Police’s serious collision investigation unit, said: ‘Our thoughts and sympathies are with the families of the man and woman at this tragic time and we have specially-trained officers supporting them.

‘We are keen to speak to anyone who saw the blue Vauxhall Corsa in the area shortly before the collision, and I would urge you to speak to police if you have any piece of information, no matter how small. 

Police investigation: Two men aged 20 and 59 and two women aged 19 and 47 were later arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and remain in police custody for questioning

On the scene: Police said they are 'fully investigating the circumstances leading up to this collision'

‘We are fully investigating the circumstances leading up to this collision and are appealing for anyone with any information to call us.’

Princess Road was closed for about eight hours on Tuesday night near the accident scene as detectives investigated - and reopened at 6.20am today.

Tributes were posted on Twitter yesterday to the unnamed woman who died.

Manchester-based youth worker Kemoy Walker said: 'Life is precious, life is short, appreciate every second - RIP to the lady who was killed in an hit and run outside Asda Hulme last night.'

Student Emma Milton said she was 'so, so, so, sad' after driving past the scene last night, while Neeka Loren posted yesterday: 'Thoughts go out to the families of those who were injured and killed in the accident on Princess Road.'

Hulme is a former industrial suburb to the south of Manchester city centre, with a population of about 15,000. Notable former residents include singer Morrissey and footballer Albert Scanlon.

A spokesman for Asda told MailOnline that the crash happened on the main road near its store - but not directly outside, adding: ‘Our store remained open and was trading as normal.'
