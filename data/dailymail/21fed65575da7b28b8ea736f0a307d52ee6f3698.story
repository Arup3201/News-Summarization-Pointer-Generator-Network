A borders row erupted last night after a Latvian killer was named the prime suspect over missing Alice Gross.

Arnis Zalkalns, 41, was jailed in 1998 for battering his wife to death in his homeland.

But after just seven years inside he was free to move here without immigration officials or police knowing of his murderous past.

And he is now at the centre of an international manhunt in the case of 14-year-old Alice who vanished three weeks ago in west London.

MPs said the case made a mockery of Britain’s borders with the European Union. 

‘It’s completely unacceptable for a convicted murderer from another country to ever be allowed to stay in this country,’ said Tory backbencher Philip Davies.

‘I have no confidence in our border controls as far as I can see – they must be the laughing stock of the world now.

‘Police are never going to be able to keep tabs on the criminal records of people with European passports – they have got no chance. 

'We need to get control of our borders. If we have open borders then by definition we are going to be dealing with all sorts of murderers, rapists, drug dealers and other serious criminals walking in.’

Alice’s family are said to be deeply upset by the developments.

Zalkalns was convicted of murder after luring his wife to a forest outside the Latvian capital Riga where he beat her over the head with a scaffold pole and stabbed her in the chest.

He was jailed for 12 years for the March 1997 murder but was released early in 2005. He fled to Britain in 2007 after his second wife and daughter from his first marriage, now 19, found out about his past. Immigration officials, who had no idea of his record, let him in.

Two years later he was arrested in Ealing, west London, over an alleged indecent assault on a 14-year-old girl, but was never prosecuted because the victim was unable to substantiate her account.

Alice vanished while walking on the Grand Union Canal towpath in Hanwell, west London. Zalkalns was captured on CCTV cycling along the same path just 15 minutes after the schoolgirl walked past the camera at 3.45pm on August 28. She was last seen at 4.26pm.

Teams of police divers and sniffer dogs have spent more than a week scouring a mile of the murky canal but have found no sign of the teenager.

Detective Superintendent Carl Mehta, who is overseeing the inquiry, said: ‘They were both going in the same direction so it is clear he would have passed her.

‘The focus of this investigation is now what happened when this took place.’

But Scotland Yard is facing questions about why it has taken so long to reveal that their prime suspect is a convicted killer suspected of sexual assault.

Zalkalns disappeared on the night of September 3 from the Ealing home he shares with his girlfriend Katerina Laiblova and their one-year-old daughter. 

Yesterday police were seen digging up the garden of his flat and removing potential evidence.

The Home Office operates a computer system called the ‘Warnings Index’ which contains information shared by foreign countries, including European Union states, on terrorists and criminals. Anyone on the database who attempts to enter the UK is supposed to be flagged by the system, allowing immigration officers the opportunity to interview them and potentially refuse entry.

However Latvian authorities insist they were under no obligation to forewarn their British colleagues about Zalkalns’ conviction because he was not wanted for any offence. Latvian police informed Scotland Yard about his record a few days ago when it was requested through Interpol.

But amid farcical scenes, detectives were still awaiting details of the case yesterday, even though it took the Mail less than an hour to uncover his past.

Last September a report by the National Audit Office said the index was ‘unstable and at risk of collapsing’ and that it ‘contained a great deal of out-of-date information’.

Last night it was unclear whether even Zalkalns’ girlfriend was aware of his past. Miss Laiblova, a 39-year-old waitress from Prague, has described him as a loving family man who dotes on their daughter Linda.

Police have issued an all ports and airports alert for the Latvian and urged people not to approach him. They also announced a reward of up to £20,000 for information.

Last night a Metropolitan Police spokesman said they would not comment further on the 1998 conviction: ‘As with all live investigations there is information that the police have that they cannot and should not make public. To obtain the full file in relation to the conviction of Arnis Zalkalns we now need to obtain an international letter of request.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We have detailed arrangements in place to identify people of concern entering the UK.

‘All passengers are checked against police, security and immigration watch lists and where we are aware of individuals who pose a risk, Border Force officers can – and do – refuse them entry.’
