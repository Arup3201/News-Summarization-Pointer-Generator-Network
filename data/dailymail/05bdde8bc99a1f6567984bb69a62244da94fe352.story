A Southern California man standing trial for a grisly revenge massacre on the family of his ex-girlfriend said he was 'high on drugs' when he made threats against them and 'didn't want to kill them'.

Iftekhar Murtaza, 29, is accused of stabbing and beating his ex-girlfriend's father and sister to death, slashing her mother's throat and burning down the family's Orange County home in May 2007.

Murtaza said he had been 'upset' after being dumped by his girlfriend, then-18-year-old Shayona Dhanak, in March of 2007 because her parents had threatened to stop paying her college tuition if she continued seeing him.

Delusional: Prosecutors said Murtaza was hoping that after the attack, his ex-girlfriend would see him as a 'white knight' and come back to him. She allegedly broke up with him because she was Hindu and he Muslim

Dhanak's parents were practicing Hindus and told her Murtaza and his Muslim family came from a line of 'beggars and servants'.

He
is alleged to have started planning a murder plot, which involved 
paying a friend $30,000 to assist him in killing Dhanak's parents, so he
could be with her.

Murtaza 
said he went home after the break-up, took ecstasy and starting chatting
with a friend online about how he wished Dhanak's parents were dead.

'I didn't want to kill them,' he told the court, according to Fox News. 'It was just a figure of speech.

'I was frustrated, I was upset. I just wished they would accept me.

'It's almost like I am not human to them, based on the family that I was born into.'

Murtaza said he repeated his wish that the Dhanaks would die or disappear to dozens of friends out of his sense of frustration and despair and that his relationship would be fine if not for them.

However the prosecution said that, in reality, Dhanak wanted to end the relationship with Murtaza because he had become controlling and violent.

Inferno: This is all that was left of the Dhanka family's mansion in Anaheim Hills, California, which was burned down after becoming the scene of a double homicide

Alleged killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter

Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight

Murtaza's testimony came following 
weeks of testimony by witnesses for the prosecution, including Shayona 
Dhanak and her mother Leela, who survived the attack.

Leela Dhanak broke down on the stand as she talked about still hearing her spouse’s screams of terror in her sleep years later.

Mrs Dhanak told the Orange County courtroom that she was attacked when she came home in May 2007 and fell unconscious, according to the Orange Country Register.

She was found on the front lawn of a neighbors property by police, who had responded to a fire at Mrs Dhanak's home.

The woman woke up from a coma three weeks later to discover the family’s Anaheim Hills mansion had been burned, and her husband, 56-year-old Jaypraykash Dhanak, and elder daughter, Karishma Dhanak, 20, killed.

Last month, a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak was alive when her throat was slit and her body was doused with gasoline and set on fire.

Autopsy results showed Jayprakash Dhanak suffered 29 stab wounds to his body.

He also had his skull fractured, resulting in a fatal brain injury.

Their bodies had been found in a park in Irvine about two miles from the University of California dorn where Shayona Danak lived.

Several days after the killings, Murtaza was interviewed by police.

The next day, prosecutors say he was arrested at the airport in Phoenix with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash.

Ball and chain: In 2011, Murtaza (left) tied the knot with fellow suspected murderer Marissa Star Bilotti (right), 20, in a jailhouse ceremony where the newlyweds were separated by a chain-link fence

He was expected to return to the witness stand Wednesday.

Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted of the killings and one of them has been sentenced to life in prison.

During her testimony, Mrs Dhanak admitted she didn't particularly like Murtaza, but had her daughter truly loved him, she would have supported the young couple.

‘She was too young to fall in love with any guys,’ she told the court.

In June 2011, Murtaza married 20-year-old suspected murderer Marissa Star Bilotti in a jailhouse ceremony after exchanging letters for five months.

Bilotti is charged with first-degree murder, burglary, and robbery. 

She faces 32 years to life in prison for helping a friend, Derek Christopher Adams, murder a man in 2010.
