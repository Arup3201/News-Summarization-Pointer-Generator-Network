British backpacker Hannah Witheridge was attacked by three men before she was brutally beaten to death, police have revealed.

General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang said officers have uncovered an important piece of evidence which makes them even more determined to catch those responsible.

Thai police have been heavily criticised over the investigation into the deaths of Miss Witheridge and David Miller on Koh Tao's Sairee Beach, as the line of inquiry has changed several times.

Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of 23-year-old from Great Yarmouth in the early hours of September 15.

A condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman's DNA on its outer skin. 

Police have already said that DNA recovered from her body has shown that two men took advantage of her on the morning of her death. 

'The discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence,' said provincial police commander General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang.

'Solving this crime is going to come down to DNA matches and we are working hard on this.'

Her recently-met friend David Miller, 24, from Jersey died when he was attacked after - it is believed - he went to her aid when he found her in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach.

DNA found on a cigarette matches a sample taken from Miss Witheridge and police say they are hoping that matching it with a suspect would 'open the door' to finding who else was involved.

'There is no doubt the murder of Miss Witheridge was sexually motivated because none of her belongings or those of the English man were missing,' said General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang.

'Yes, the motivation for the attack is rape.'

He said the attackers might have been smoking when they saw Miss Witheridge walking back to her guest house alone along the beach.

Police have taken more than 200 DNA samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from Burma.

But there have been no matches so far with the victims.

Miss Witheridge's family said they are  'broken' by her death and revealed several days ago that they have returned to the UK with her body.

In a statement, they said: 'As a family we feel enormous relief to have Hannah back at home where she belongs.

'We continue to work closely with officers to assist in the investigation and bring those responsible to justice.

'Our family is broken and require time to grieve in private - as do Hannah's many friends.'
