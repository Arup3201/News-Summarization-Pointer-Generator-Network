A satirical take on immigration involving birds on a wire by renowned artist Banksy has flown over the heads of council officials who labelled it 'offensive' and scrubbed it out.  

Locals at the seaside town of Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, were abuzz when the graffiti appeared on Tendring District Council's boathouse at West Beach this week. 

It showed five grey pigeons holding up signs including one stating 'Go Back to Africa', seemingly aimed at a more colourful bird.

One of the pigeons' signs said 'Migrants Not Welcome' whilst another was holding a placard with the words 'Keep Off Our Worms'.

A satirical take on immigration involving birds on a wire by renowned artist Banksy in Clacton-on-Sea has flown over the heads of council officials who labelled it 'offensive' and scrubbed it out

The mural appeared on a Tendring District Council boathouse at West Beach and was scrubbed out today

The council scrubbed the mural - potentially worth thousands of pounds - off the wall today after receiving a complaint on Tuesday from a member of the public saying 'offensive and racist remarks' had been painted on the wall. 

One of Banky's graffiti pieces, recently cut off brickwork in east London sold for £500,000, and in 2008, at artwork of his sold for over £1 million in New York.

Clacton-on-Sea locals were disappointed with the decision, which came just hours after Banksy posted a picture of his latest work on his website banksy.co.uk.

Rebecca Bennett, 18, said she went down to the boathouse today after hearing about the famous new addition and couldn't 'believe it's gone already'.

She said: 'I am gutted. Seems a bit of an own-goal by the council as it would have been a massive tourist attraction.

'Even controversial artwork should be for people to debate - not be wiped from history.

The council removed the Banksy artwork after receiving a complaint that it was 'racist and offensive'

'I bet that's the last time we'll get a Banksy here in Clacton'.

Nigel Brown, Tendring District Council's communications manager, said staff had inspected the site after receiving a complaint and 'agreed that it could be seen as offensive'.

He said it was removed 'in line with our policy to remove this type of material within 48 hours'.

Mr Brown added: 'We would obviously welcome an appropriate Banksy original on any of our seafronts and would be delighted if he returned in the future.'

The scrubbed out Banksy was the second to appear this week, after one showing an elderly woman with headphones staring at an empty plinth was done in Folkestone, Kent

 A spokesman for Banksy said he would not comment on the council's actions

Clacton-on-Sea has been in the headlines recently after its Tory MP, Douglas Carswell, defected to UKIP. A by-election for the seat is due to take place next week.

The scrapped Banksy work is the second to appear this week. One showing an elderly woman with headphones staring at an empty plinth was done in Folkestone, Kent.
