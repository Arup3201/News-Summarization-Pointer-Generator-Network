Lindsay Lohan's mother has claimed she was raped by her husband Michael Lohan on Valentine's Day 1990 while he was high on cocaine.

The former dancer and singer, who has alleged she suffered a catalogue of domestic abuse at the hands of the partner, say the incident happened during a period of estrangement - and as her young children Lindsay and Michael Jr slept nearby.

Michael, 52, has vehemently denied the claims - saying the sexual encounter in question was consensual.

The bombshell news comes as Dina, 50, 
lifted the lid on her tumultuous 22-year union with the stockbroker, in 
interviews with the New York Daily News and Entertainment Tonight.

'Michael was addicted to cocaine, like
 most stockbrokers back then. He had a lot of bad stuff going on,' Dina 
told the New York Daily News.

She detailed how the incident took 
place at her parents' home saying they were estranged at the time with 
Michael allegedly partying with models every night.

Michael, recently released from a 
90-day stint in jail for  a securities fraud charge at the time, arrived in a 
limousine and apparently begged Dina to take him back, she claims.

'He was out of jail and on another 
coke-fuelled night. He said, "I love you and I want to be with you," but
 then it went dark. It went dark really quick.'

It was then, she claimed, Michael raped her as her two children Lindsay and Michael Jr were sleeping.

Years after the incident the couple 
went on to have two more children together, Ali and Cody, before their 
divorce was finalised in 2007.

'[They] were sleeping, and I just knew I had to stay quiet — I don’t want to wake them,' she recalled.

The New York Daily News claims to have
 seen medical records that show Dina went to hospital and reported a 
rape. She was examined by doctors but never pressed charges.

In response to the claims, Michael admitted they did have sex that night - but said it was consensual.

He claimed Dina invited him to her parents' house and instigated the sexual encounter in a first-floor bedroom.

Michael said Dina only alleged rape after calling him later that night and realising he was with another woman.

Denial: Michael has denied the allegations, saying he swung out at Dina in a reflex reaction after she hit him with an ice tray. He has also vehemently denied the rape allegations

'I went over to her parents’ house and 
made love to her,' he told the publication.

'When I left and she called me, she 
found out I was with (the girlfriend) and called police. Then she called
 me the next day, crying. I said, "Let’s work this out". And I got back 
with Dina. There were no charges.'

Dina has also released photographs to prove she experienced domestic violence.

She
 shared two old pictures, of her looking younger with a black eye and 
holding Lindsay as a baby, in a desperate bid to back up her claims that
 she suffered years of physical abuse at the hands of Michael in the 
early years of their marriage.

According to Entertainment Tonight the
 socialite released the shocking images to back up her recent 
allegations that her 26-year-old daughter is 'so screwed up' because of 
her tumultuous relationship with her father and the hard partying 
actress regularly witnessed violent domestic abuse as a child.

Dina told the New York Daily News: 'Lindsay saw her dad abuse me - that's why she's so screwed up. She saw a lot of crazy stuff.

'Michael beat the hell out of me,' Dina said describing the alleged 1986 incident, which came four years before the alleged rape.

'I want the world to know the root of 
her problems. Lindsay saw all the beatings and all the abuse. She said, 
"Stay, mommy, don't leave".'

The
 Liz & Dick actress' mother said she decided to share her story 
after she came across one of the photos of her with a black eye.

In another snap Dina is seen holding Lindsay as baby, while still sporting the black eye.

'When Lindsay saw the photo, she was furious,' said Dina. 'She said, "Tell the world! Talk about it!"'

But Michael insists that he never deliberately hurt Dina.

He told the New York Daily News in 
response to the images of Dina sporting a black eye: 'Dina hit me with an ice tray, and I turned
 around and swung...I didn't punch her.

'I didn't do anything deliberately to attack her. I swung out of reflex...she's twisting everything.'
