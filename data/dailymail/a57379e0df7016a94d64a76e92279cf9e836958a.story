The net has barely stopped bustling after Brazil were written in the record books for all the wrong reasons, and it has only gotten worse as the media turn on their so-called World Cup heroes.

Some newspapers say they 'learned what real shame is', others tell manager Luiz Felipe Scolari to 'go to hell', and another tells their readers to write their own front page.

And their damning analyses of Brazil's performance are reaching the people, too, after every copy of every newspaper sold out at Belo Horizonte airport.

Here, Sportsmail dissects how Brazil's media have reacted to the 7-1 humiliation on Tuesday.

O Globo

O Globo felt Brazil played so bad that they rated each player zero out of 10. Their one-word analysis of Fred? 'Tragic.' Oscar? 'Weak.' Ramires? 'Irrelevant.'

And they aren't holding back on their front page, either. They opt for a picture of Brazil captain David 
Luiz, looking devastated. 'Shame. Grievance. Humiliation,' reads the 
dominating headline.

Correio Braziliense

'Embarrassment for eternity,' according to Correio Brazilense,
 who go on to give a large explanation of the downfall. The text is 
surrounded by glum photos of Luiz, Scolari and devastated supporters.

No score: O Globo rated each Brazilian player zero out of 10 and gave the Germans glowing reviews

INFORMACAO EXTRA

Informacao Extra stretch as far back as 64 years ago, when hosts Brazil lost the World Cup to Uruguay. They write: 'Congratulations! To the runners-up of 1950, who had always been accused of heaping the biggest shame on Brazilian football. Yesterday, we learned what real shame is.'

O DIA

The appropriately-named O Dia go in hard on Brazil manager Scolari, saying: 'Go to hell, Felipe!' Scolari won the 2002 World Cup with Brazil, but 12 years on, that's not enough to save the 65-year-old from scrutiny. The boss reminds the readers how many Germany scored, too.

Meia Hora

A black and white Meia Hora refuse to design their cover, saying 'THERE IS NO FRONT PAGE' in block capitals.

It continues: 'Today there won't be any fun, the people feel ashamed. Tomorrow, we'll go back to normal.' The newspaper also compliments Germany's attack and ridicules Brazil's defence, adding: 'While you're reading this, Germany have scored another goal.'

Lance!

A blank canvas, Lance allows its readers to design their own front page. 'Indignation, revolt, pain, frustration, irritation, shame, pity, disillusion,' it reads. 'Say what you're feeling and write it on this front page of Lance!' For some fans, there wouldn't be enough space.

No cover: Meia Hora and Lance thought no pictures could do justice to the loss and chose radical fronts

Agora

Brazil must feel they've been let off easy by Agora, who opt for a picture showing Germany celebrating as Julio Cesar collects the ball from the back of the net. They say their dream turned into a nightmare.

Folha de Sao Paulo

Folha de Sao Paulo say Brazil suffered the 'worst defeat in history' on Tuesday, and go dark as the nation mourn after their World Cup dream was left in pieces.

Jornal de Noticias

Brazil are let off a little lightly here, as Jornal de Noticias blame 'The German Complex'. Germany, undoubtedly, were as impressive as Brazil were poor in the World Cup quarter-final clash.
