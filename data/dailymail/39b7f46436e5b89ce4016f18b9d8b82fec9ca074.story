Gaudy palaces suspected of being built by Romany criminal masterminds on the back of criminal gang activities in the UK and other European countries are facing demolition.

Authorities in Hunedoara, a city in central-western Romania, are threatening to tear down the so-called 'gypsy palaces' which have appeared across the region because all were built illegally, and many of them are safety hazards.

Police believe most were constructed on the back of illicit criminal enterprises abroad.

Many of the sports cars parked outside the homes have a UK number plate.

Checks carried out this month by employees of Hunedoara City Hall revealed that more than 50 buildings in and around the city did not receive planning permission.

The investigation also revealed that some of those who had the houses built around Chizid and Hadat were not even the rightful owners of the land on which they stand.

'The Court of Auditors recommended us to find a solution so that the owners of these properties comply to the law and pay taxes for them,' said the mayor of Hunedoara, Viorel Arion. 

The cars all have UK number plates which suggest the owners have links to the UK

But he warned that the legal process of demolition could take a while.

The
 palatial neighbourhood of Hunedoara's gypsy palaces began to expand a 
decade ago and now includes a few dozen villas on both sides of the road
 on the way to the village of Calan.

'Drivers
 stop their cars next to the palaces and are always surprised by the 
fancy ideas that the owners dreamed up,' said a man named Vasile, a 
neighbour of the Roma families.

A senior Romanian police officer working in Bucharest told the Mail Online: 'It is an open secret that many of these properties were financed by crime, but as it was not crime in Romania there is little that can or is done about it, our resources are concentrated on tackling crime here.

'We have had some raids on the gypsy clans engaging in child trafficking and prostitution as these are after all Romanian citizens that were often the victims, but the begging gangs, the pickpockets and the scrap metal thieves that are all operating abroad, its hard to tackle these groups as at the end of the day cross border crime is very problematic to take action over.

'If anything, the  palaces should come under scrutiny from the Romanian taxman which does periodically stages raids, these properties are after all conspicuous proof of possible undeclared income.

'And they are also often built with very little regard to either planning permission or indeed the basic building safety requirements, which is the responsibility of the local councils.

'Both these bodies can and do take action, although so far it seems with little impact, given the way the properties are multiplying and spreading.'

Across Romania after the borders were opened, the gypsies who faced prejudice and abuse back home left to go abroad and not all were looking to earn money honestly.

Across Romania after the borders were opened, the gypsies who faced prejudice and abuse back home left to go abroad and not all were looking to earn money honestly.

When some of them made vast amounts 
earned from everything from begging and pickpocketing, child trafficking
 and prostitution through to scrap metal theft, the slums were 
dismantled to make way for yet more palatial homes.

With
 the lifting of restrictions to working in the UK, more of these 
criminal gangs could be set to make their way to England under the 
pretence of 'looking for work'.

The
 garish looking palatial type homes exude wealth via the 
brightly-coloured buildings with flamboyant decor, top of the range cars
 often with UK number plates parked outside and gaudy statues filling 
the gardens.

Here there are no signs of the economic crisis which it is all too plain to see in many towns throughout the UK.

Looking
 around many of the streets are empty, there are not many people around,
 despite there being thousands registered as living in the area, not to 
mention the thousands more known to be living unregistered in the 
community - as is normal in Romania's Roma communities.

People
 are reluctant to talk. The Roma community like to keep their business, 
and particularly their money making activities, a closely guarded 
secret.

One of the few that 
spoke out told MailOnline: 'Many of the people who live here are away on business. 
The men are often away for months on end. They go abroad in search of 
work I was told. I don't know exactly what they do. We are not told 
much.

'I know they work in England, Germany and France. For months they are gone and they send money back to their families here in the village. As you can see, a lot of money, that is what keeps the wealth growing here.

'The village used to be small, when my family moved here, it used to be just scattered with caravans and not a lot else, but over the last decade the area has become more wealthy and huge houses have been built one after the other.

'People are very proud of their houses, everyone wants their house to look bigger and better than their neighbours.

'Pride is a very important thing in the community. Of course they are worthless, no Romanian would live in them, they are always built to look good, but the quality is rumoured to be bad.'

A local gypsy, whose house is made of dried mud bricks on the outskirts of town, said. 'There are honest people here, if you want to know who they are, look at the houses.'
