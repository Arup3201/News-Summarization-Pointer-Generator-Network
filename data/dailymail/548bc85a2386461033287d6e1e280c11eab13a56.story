A cheeky student president is being investigated after footage emerged of him unclipping a girl's bra at an alcohol-fuelled university party.

Nick Swain, 22, was filmed sneaking up on the blonde student from behind while being egged on by friends before grabbing her red underwear and unhooking it one-handed.

The Warwick University student, who is standing for re-election as president this week, then cheers as the shocked girl desperately tries to cover herself up.

Swain lunged at the student during the filming of a promotional video for the university's skiing and snowboarding society in December 2011.

He and friends had gone abroad for the ski trip, believed to be in Austria, where they shot the footage.

But a disgusted student uploaded the clip to YouTube this week - which has been viewed 5,000 times - branding him 'vile' and demanding an apology.

The 90-second clip also shows half-naked students pulling their trousers down, appearing to wear Hitler moustaches while shouting 'get your t*ts out'.

The video opens with a shot of Swain - 
studying for an MA in Creative and Media Enterprises at the Coventry seat of learning - sitting at a 
table laden with empty bottles.

The camera then pans around the room showing male students downing drinks before Swain is seen creeping up behind a group of girls who are wearing just their underwear.

A friend of the victim tries to stop him but he forces her away before carefully unhooking the bra.

He then triumphantly turns around to face the camera holding his fist in the air.

The video repeats the motion several times before a sign appears on screen stating: 'Warwick SU (Students' Union). We demand an apology from Nick Swain for his foul, sexist behaviour.

The video of Swain lunging at the female student was taken in December 2011. But a disgusted student uploaded the clip to YouTube this week, branding him 'vile' and demanding an apology

'We will not tolerate misogyny from our elected representatives.

'Societies and their exec committees must respect all students. That includes women.'

The Students' Union has now launched an investigation into Swain who was elected last year by a record number of votes.

In a statement issued by Swain - who has said he worked for NatWest and Goldman Sachs - he said: 'I unreservedly apologise for my actions and for any offence that this video has caused.

'This event took place in December 2011, many months before I was elected as president of Warwick Students' Union, on a holiday amongst friends.

'However, this fact in no way justifies my behaviour as portrayed in the video.

'The woman involved is a good friend of mine and has reassured me that I caused her no harm or offence as a result, but I nevertheless offer my apologies.

'I feel that this video is not a reflection of my fundamental values and certainly does not represent the way I conduct myself as president of Warwick Students' Union.

'I reiterate my sincerest apologies.'

The apology has not satisfied student union bosses who announced they had launched an investigation.

A spokesperson said: 'Warwick Students' 
Union is currently investigating complaints that allege that a 
sabbatical officer has engaged in behaviour that may violate the union's
code of conduct and equal opportunities policy.

'Warwick Students' Union continuously strives to support and promote its code of conduct and equal opportunities policy, and we take any alleged breaches of the policy extremely seriously.

'The union is now actively investigating these complaints.'

There has been a mixed response to the video on YouTube, with one user writing: 'As a result of this video, I will be voting Nick Swain for president next year.'

But another student added: 'The behaviour of pretty much everyone a the party looked abhorrent.

'Aside from the absolutely shocking assault of Nick Swain on an innocent woman, other students were wearing Hitler moustaches while screaming football chants.

'As university students they should have fun, of course, but be above such animalistic behaviour.'

The university yesterday said it was a 'matter for the Students' Union'.
