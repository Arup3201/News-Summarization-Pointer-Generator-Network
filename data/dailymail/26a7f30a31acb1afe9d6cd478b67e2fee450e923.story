A man who works for a mining company in Perth by day has captured a series of spectacular photographs, shot during an intense lightning storm near his home.

Photographer Oliver Kay was woken by thunder at 3.30 in the morning last week, with his first instinct to grab his camera and capture the storm that was unfolding above him in Hillarys Marina, on the west coast of Australia.

'The sound was almost deafening and took your breath away,' Oliver said.

Oliver Kay captured these spectacular lightning shots during an intense storm above his house in Perth last week

He moved to Western Australia from Britain a decade ago, and spends every spare moment he gets capture Mother Nature's beauty

These lightning shots were taken over his home in Hillarys Marina, at 3.30 in the morning

'It was probably the closest call I've had with lightning. I've been caught up in lighthouses and blown by the wind and rain but generally take safety first when dealing with the weather.' 

Originally from Britain, Oliver left his IT job a decade ago and moved to Western Australia to start a new life with his wife Helen.

Although his day job includes working at one of Australia's biggest mining companies in Perth, he spends his weekends focusing on his real passion, photography. 

'It was probably the closest call I've had with lightning' Oliver said of his encounter with the storm

Oliver likes to take on landscape photographs from a fresh approach, like with this sunset over Perth Harbour

By day he works for one of the city's biggest mining companies, but his real passion lies in photography

The storm images, which show bright bolts of lighting splitting the sky in half were shot on a Canon 5d mkIII DSLR with a Canon 24-105 f/4 lens.  

'Everybody has a camera these days especially smart phone cameras so people are getting less and less impressed with landscape photos,' Oliver said.

'But the ones where Mother Nature puts on a show like she did that morning has earned me nothing but wonderful feedback.'

Oliver ditched the UK after 31 years for a rather large sea change and to escape the working grind, but it is the stormy weather that is giving him the best opportunities to practice his calling.

'I've always had a passion for landscape photography and spend most of the weekends trying to capture the stunning Australian scenery,' he revealed.

'The only problem with great scenery is that there are thousands of people getting the same shots over and over again of the same locations - with storms there is never two photos the same.

'Lightning never will create the same patterns from one bolt to the next and clouds are always different in shape, size and colour which adds so much drama to any landscape,' Oliver added.

Living near the harbour in Perth gives him the unique opportunity to capture stunning shots over the water
