As early as late 600s Japan there have been 'female entertainers' hosting gatherings, pouring sake and offering company to men.

Known as 'saburuko' - translated as 'serving girls' - some of these women sold sexual services, while others simply hosted high-class occasions. And around 794 the culture of the geisha began to emerge: women who men would visit for romantic and sexual pleasure.

Traditional geisha - heavily made-up, immaculately dressed and coquettish entertainers - emerged in 18th century Japan, and these women did not officially sell sex - that being the preserve of a different group of female entertainers known as Oiran.

But this stunning collection of photographs of geisha during the second half of the 20th century shows how the ancient Japanese art found its place in a more modern world full of businessmen, beer and steam baths.

The black and white photographs show young geisha wearing kimonos with their dark hair neatly tied up in tight wide buns practicing their trade in the geisha house under the instruction of a more senior woman.

Others show geisha giggling coquettishly while hosting businessmen over sushi suppers, giggling and pouring sake. In a third photo a geisha is seen walking home in her platform flip-flops at the end of her shift, glancing back at the camera past a row of umbrellas being dried out in an alleyway.

The female entertainers are also pictured learning to play the samisen, a traditional Japanese stringed instrument, pouring beer into the mouths of 1950s businessmen while they relax in steam baths, giving men massages by trampling all over their bodies, and getting ready for work in beautiful patterned kimonos and high flip-flops.

Enclosed pleasure quarters known as 
yūkaku were built in the 16th century in Japan, outside of which prostitution was
 be illegal, and within which yūjo (play women) would be classified and 
licensed.

The highest yūjo class was the geisha's predecessor, called oiran, a combination of actress and 
prostitute, who performed erotic dances as part of a new art known as kabuku.

The talented courtesans entertained clients by dancing, singing, and playing 
music, while some specialised as poets or calligraphers.

Near the turn of the eighteenth century those who specialised in 'entertaining' emerged as geisha, and many of these were men.

The first woman known to have 
called herself geisha was a Fukagawa prostitute, a skilled singer and shamisen-player named Kikuya, in about 1750.

Geisha who worked within the pleasure quarters were forbidden to sell sex as it was the preserve of the oiran - though prostitution was legal up until the 
1900s, so it was practiced in many quarters throughout Japan.

By
 1800, being a geisha was considered a female occupation - though a 
handful of male geisha still working today - and by the 1830s women 
throughout society copied the geisha look.

World War II brought down the geisha population when many women had to go and work in factories across Japan.

Simultaneously, the 
name 'geisha' lost status prostitutes 
began referring to themselves as 'geisha girls' to attract American military 
men.

After Japan lost the 
war geisha dispersed and the profession began to crumble, but the art flourished once more in the 1960s.
