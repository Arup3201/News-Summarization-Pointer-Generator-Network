President Obama is poised to launch new airstrikes against ISIS in Syria as part of an effort to  'degrade' the militant group terrorizing the Middle East.

Obama is expected announce plans this evening to go on the offense against ISIS by expanding airstrikes to include targets beyond those necessary to protect Americans and support Iraqi forces.

The broader air strike campaign will ramp up gradually, CBS News reports, and will focus on helping Iraqis retake their country from the violent extremist group.

The news organization said the president also plans to deploy more troops to Iraq. It was not immediately clear how many more forces Obama would send in and what role they would play.

Obama is preparing for a prime-time televised speech in which he will spell out a long-awaited strategy to confront ISIS, a brutal terror network that has captured huge swathes of Iraq and Syria and published depraved videos showing its fighters beheading American journalists.

The United States military has already launched targeted strikes against the group's positions in Iraq, but has yet to strike at their strongholds in Syria, where the extremists are also fighting soldiers from the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.

Obama told congressional leaders on Tuesday that he has the authority he needs to broaden his military campaign into Syria, striking ISIS in its stronghold despite objections from Assad.

A source familiar with the president's plans told CBS News on Wednesday that Obama would 'eventually' strike Syria, but analysts have not finished identifying targets there.

Among the announcements Obama will make Wednesday is the authorization of new counterterrorism efforts. 

He also plans to pledge American troops to training and equipping moderate elements of the Assad's Islamist opposition.` 

Hours before Obama met with senior Capitol Hill leaders, former Vice President Dick Cheney told House GOP stalwarts in the National Republican Congressional Committee that they need to stand strong in the age of ISIS against the Obama administration's efforts to pare back military spending.

Cheney reportedly blamed Obama's isolationist tendencies forcefully for the rise of Middle Eastern Islamist extremism, particularly ISIS's rush to fill a power vacuum left when Obama pulled U.S. troops out of Iraq.

The Washington Examiner reported that a meeting attendee said Cheney warned 'how unprepared the U.S. military is for any kind of medium- or large-scale engagement against ISIS because the administration is cutting the military so much.' 

As the pendulum swings back toward more military action in Iraq, a senior administration official confirmed to The New York Times.that fresh airstrikes will be a prominent feature of Obama's nascent strategy.

The package could also include a $500 million fund to arm Syrian rebels groups in their fight against ISIS, which was suggested earlier this year but has yet to be approved.

The impending new plans come as John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, arrives in Baghdad to meet with the new Iraqi prime minister.

Kerry will urge newly-installed Haider al-Abadi to unite the rival factions in his country - as well as offering U.S. help to tackle ISIS.

In his 9:00 p.m. address, Obama will challenge Congress to quickly give him authority to arm moderate Syrian opposition forces fighting Assad.

But administration officials said he will press forward with other elements of his plan without formal authorization from lawmakers.

Those include increased support for Iraqi security forces, as well as military and diplomatic commitments from partners in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere.

Obama sent a memorandum to Kerry on Wednesday afternoon directing him to set aside $25 million for 'immediate military assistance' for the Iraqi government and Kurdish forces.

After an hour of discussion with congressional leaders yesterday, Obama told lawmakers that he 'has the authority he needs to take action' against ISIS.

The White House added that the president still would welcome action from Congress that would 'aid the overall effort and demonstrate to the world that the United States is united in defeating the threat.' 

Among the president's most urgent priorities will be seeking authorization from Congress to arm more moderate elements of the Syrian opposition fighting Assad. The president asked lawmakers earlier this year for a $500 million train-and-equip program, but the plan stalled on Capitol Hill.

Nearly five in 10 Americans believe that the country is less safe now than it was before 9/11, a new poll shows.

Americans who are worried about security threats far outnumber those who think that the United States is more safe than it was after the nation attacked by Al Qaeda or just as safe.

The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 47 percent of Americans said they felt less safe than before compared to the 26 percent who said they felt more safe. Another 26 percent reported no change in the perception of their safety.

A majority, 61 percent, also expressed support for military action against Islamic extremists in Iraq and Syria who some lawmakers believe may be targeting the U.S. for an attack.

Obama and Biden spent Wednesday afternoon calling lawmakers to make a last-minute plea for them to add the measure to a continuing resolution to keep the government open that they intend to debate on Thursday.

House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, who was one of the members on the receiving end of a call from the president, said he wasn't in favor of introducing a new element into the government funding debate so late in the process.

'They've known about this problem for over a year,' Rogers told The Hill. 'It's a complicated, big-time change in policy... Let us go ahead with a CR to keep the government going.' 

Still, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday that the legislative body would postpone a vote on the resolution until next week. 

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi argued that authorization for the military effort should be 'on whatever engine is leaving the station, and that's one that is leaving the station.'

That's for sure a must-pass bill in a [short window] of time, and I would hope that it would be on there,' she said on Wednesday.

The U.S. is already running a small-scaled CIA scheme to train rebels, but Obama is hoping for approval for a more overt military effort that could involve staging training locations in countries near Syria.

With Obama ruling out sending U.S. ground troops into combat in Iraq or Syria, bolstering the capacity of the Iraqi security forces and Syrian opposition will be crucial to efforts to root out the Islamic State militant group.

Administration officials said Obama also sees a congressional approval for a the training scheme as a way to send a strong signal to allies considering similar efforts.

Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to the Middle East on Wednesday for discussions in Saudi Arabia and Jordan.

On Capitol Hill, there was little consensus on the scope of Obama's authority to broaden the campaign against the Islamic State extremists. While some lawmakers said the president has the power he needs under the Constitution, others were seeking a more central congressional role in the effort.

'I think it is to his advantage and the country's advantage to have Congress buy into that,' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said before joining other Republican and Democratic leaders in the Oval Office on Tuesday for a meeting with Obama.

None of the leaders spoke to reporters as they left the White House.

However, an aide to House Speaker John Boehner said the Ohio Republican expressed support for efforts to increase the effectiveness of the Iraqi security forces and for equipping the Syrian opposition.

Boehner also said he would support the deployment of U.S. military personnel to Iraq in a training and advisory role and to 'assist with lethal targeting' of ISIS, according to the aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the private meeting by name.

The U.S. is already launching airstrikes against Islamic State targets inside Iraq, a mission undertaken at the invitation of the Iraqi government and without formal authorization from Congress. 

But the scope of the mission has been limited to strikes that help protect American interests in the region and prevent humanitarian crises.

U.S. officials said Obama was expected to loosen those limitations and open a broader counterterrorism campaign against the militants in Iraq.

Following the Islamic State group's shocking beheading of two American journalists in Syria, Obama began more seriously considering extending strikes into that country.

People who have spoken with Obama in recent days said it appeared likely he would take that step. 

At a private dinner Monday with foreign policy experts, Obama emphasized the importance of viewing the Islamic State as one organisation, not two groups separated by a border.

Obama's spokesman has said the president is willing 'to go wherever is necessary to strike those who are threatening Americans.' However, Obama has continued to rule out sending U.S. troops into ground combat operations in the Middle East. 

Unlike in Iraq, Obama would not be acting at the invitation of a host government. However, some international law experts say airstrikes could be justified as a matter of self-defense if Obama argues the Islamic State group poses a threat to the U.S. and its allies from inside Syria, whose government is unwilling or unable to stop it.
