George Groves is likening himself to a naughty boy in the back seat of a car annoying to distraction the driver, who in this metaphorical case is Carl Froch.

This is a cute analogy for their roles in the build up to the slugfest to be played out at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night to the guttural sound-track of an expectant 80,000, the largest boxing crowd in post-war Britain.

It is also another amusing sample of the witty, intelligent mind games which Groves has been bringing to the ring’s biggest Battles of Britain since Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank went at it in the early Nineties.

Froch, however, would argue that it is not as relevant as for their contentious first fight in November.

‘George irritated me then,’ says the world super-middleweight champion. ’I’m cool now.’

And the consensus is that a less emotional, more relaxed Froch has won the latest verbal punch-up with Groves, that eyeball to eyeball confrontation in a television studio which should help raise the pay-per-view TV sales as Sky high as the live gate.

Five months ago it was the other way around as Groves got under the skin of the world super-middleweight champion.

That time the Cobra rose from the canvas to win with a stoppage rendered controversial by the haste with which referee Howard Foster intervened.

Will it be a complete reversal of fortunes this time? Lose the slanging match, win the fight?

Saint George says so, predicting a third round KO. Froch insists that the Londoner who is nearly 10 years his junior missed his chance the first time.

Curiously, Groves was left dumb-struck in front of the Sky cameras when asked for examples to substantiate his allegation that Froch has lied about their rivalry.

Now he has found his voice again, to poke fun at Froch’s hiring of a sports shrink.

The 26-year-old Groves is back to his more familiar, articulate self when he says: ‘Carl has spent a lot time coaching himself not to lose his rag. That’s taxing. He’s like a father with a petulant kid in the back seat of the car.

‘That’s me. He has to keep turning round to tell me to behave myself. That’s wearing for him. I’m still getting on his nerves.

‘He’s getting help trying to control himself but it’s not a psychologist he needs. It’s a psychiatrist.’

Froch has turned to Manchester United’s mind coach Chris Marshall to help him concentrate on fighting, not feuding. He says: ‘I was guilty of letting George’s nonsense get to me first time out.

‘I just wanted to flatten him. I needed to remind myself that it’s called boxing, not street-fighting. If an expert can be of assistance with that, why not?

‘All the top sportsmen in the world use sports science now.’

Froch staged a Bank Holiday Monday work-out in front of his home-town faithful in a Nottingham shopping centre. He appeared as calm as during the televised exchanges with Groves, when he told his challenger: ‘I will be astonished if I don’t knock you out on Saturday.’

Groves, who is predicting a third-round stoppage of his own, is using the title of that programme - Behind the Ropes – to argue his case.

He says: ‘Carl feels like he’s cracked it but rope is the right word for all this. Give Carl enough and he’ll hang himself.’

To which Froch responds: ‘I hope he really does come out rushing to beat me inside three rounds. That will help me stop him sooner rather than later.’

The animosity between the pair is rooted in Froch’s perception that Groves does not show sufficient respect to a six-year champion going into his 12th straight world title fight against the best super-middleweights on the planet.

Groves says: ‘I respect what he’s achieved in his career but that doesn’t stop me believing I’m better than him now.’

Their TV debate ended with a handshake-cum-shoving match.

Best of enemies: There is a mutual dislike between Froch (left) and Groves but they don't 'hate' each other

It is a rich part of boxing culture that even the fiercest of opponents embrace each other once the fight has been won and lost.

Evander Holyfield, for example, has forgiven Mike Tyson for infamously biting off a chunk of his ear and they get on well now.

Can Froch and Groves ever be friends, no matter what happens on Saturday night?

First time round: Froch beat Groves after a stoppage in the ninth but it was one hell of a fight

Froch: ‘I don’t hate anyone. Not George or anyone else. But I don’t have to like him.’

Groves: ‘I’ve never had a lasting problem with anyone I’ve fought. We don’t have to end up friends but I wouldn’t want to go through life feuding with anybody.’

Perhaps they will just have to settle for becoming the best of enemies.

Froch-Groves II will be televised live on Sky Sports Box Office on Saturday night, at £16.95.

The IBF have approved Paul Butler’s fight with Stuart Hall on Saturday week as an official challenge for their world bantamweight title.

Thus Newcastle will play host to a duel between one of the hottest young prospects on the boxing scene and a man with one of the most intriguing back stories in the ring.

Butler, of Ellesmere Port, is the unbeaten super-flyweight champion of Britain and the Commonwealth and so sure of his exciting ability that he is not only moving up a division but happy to take on Darlington’s Hall in his native North East.

Hall has found redemption in boxing from a booze and drug-fuelled life in the bars of Ibiza.

He reached out heroically for unexpected world championship fame when promoter Dennis Hobson bank-rolled his successful battle with Vusi Malinga for the vacant IBF title.

Hall kept the title in his first defence, which ended in a technical draw when another British rival Martin Ward sustained an eye-cut.

As a 34-year-old late-comer to prominence, Hall’s determination to stay in the limelight has been fanned by the precocious 25-year-old Butler’s predictions of victory.

Hall says: ‘I can’t wait to shut him up.’

Hall-Butler will be televised live on BoxNation on Saturday, July 7.

Ricky Hatton’s autobiography, already a best seller in hard-back, comes out in paper-back next week.
