It is the heartwarming moment rescuers spot a pair of eyes looking back at them from the bushes alongside a busy LA freeway.

Rescuers were delighted when they found Iris the homeless dog who had been reported by a concerned member of the public and were even more surprised when they realised the injured pooch was guarding three young pups. 

Non-profit organisation Hope For Paws had to work hard to gain the trust of the terrified dog in order to try and coax her out of hiding for treatment alongside her puppies. 

Rescuers Eldad Hagar and Lisa Chiarelli had received a call received a call about Iris informing them that Iris was hiding in a den and rarely came out of hiding except to look for food late at night.

After 10 minutes of searching in bushes Mr Hagar and Ms Chiarelli finally located the anxious dog and her puppies.

Although the dog could easily have escaped she chose to stay with her puppies. 

Ms Chiarelli approaches Iris with some food and a flash-lamp and says, 'I want  you to smell this, look good girl,' and she she then puts a collar around her neck.

Light: Mr Hagar and Ms Chiarelli shine the light on Iris as they locate her after 10 months of searching

Food: Ms Chiarelli gives Iris some food as she attempts to make the anxious dog more comfortable

The Hope For Paws employee then says, 'We're here to help.'

One of Iris' eyes are badly damaged which Hope For Paws says was likely to have occurred from prior blunt force trauma.

Mr Hagar and Ms Chiarelli then take the puppies out of the bushes and  they say, 'Here see we got your babies.'

They name the puppies Seth, Nathaniel and Meg and a message then appears on the screen which says, 'Please share and help Iris, Seth, Nathaniel and Meg find their loving homes together.'

One month later Iris and her puppies are seen playing on a rug and looking very happy and comfortable.

Mr Hagar says many times when Hope For Paws  go to the rescue location it may seem like they find the dog, but this is not always the case. 

He says, 'The search for the dogs is a challenging part of it because they usually hide. Finding Iris was difficult, but it could have been dangerous... we didn't know how she would react when we entered her den, and there is always a risk when going to these rough neighbourhoods in the middle of the night.'
