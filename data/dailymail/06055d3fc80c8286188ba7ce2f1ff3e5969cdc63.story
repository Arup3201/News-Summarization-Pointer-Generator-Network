This is the adorable moment a baby panda cuddled up to its mother after going on an inquisitive prowl around its enclosure.

The baby bear is seen clambering to the top of a nearby tree in search of mischief, while perfecting its climbing skills.

The giant panda is then seen kicking back with some tasty bamboo before the six-month-old bear scampers back to its mother in search of a comfy snuggle.

The images were captured by Austrian wildlife photographer Josef Gelernter at Vienna Zoo

The cute pictures were taken at Vienna Zoo by Austrian wildlife photographer Josef Gelernter.

When the 33-year-old saw the young cub exploring his enclosure, he knew he had to capture the moment on his camera.

Mr Gelernter said: '"The cub was very active in exploring his enclosure, but always kept an eye on his mummy.

Mr Gelernter says the young panda is a huge draw at the zoo, with crowds turning up to see the baby panda

Before cuddling up to his mother, the baby panda tried out his climbing skills and clambered to the top of his tree trunk

While at the top of the tree, the six-month old giant panda decided to snack on some bamboo

The young cub has been described as 'very active' but always keeps an eye on where his mother is

'It appeared to have very close relationship to its mother, but at the same time it was very curious to check out its environment and climb around.

'You cannot imagine how many spectators the cub brought, it was actually quite funny.

'When the mother was visible there were only a few people watching but as soon as the cub appears, it gets very crowded within minutes.'

Mr Gelernter added that he thinks it's the panda's human like behaviour that makes these pictures so fascinating.

He explained: 'Cubs are wonderful to photograph as their eyes are bigger in relation to their body than the adults, which allows you capture their expressions.

'They are also very unique in their behavioural tendencies and at times can seem very human, I think that is why people find them so fascinating to watch.

'To me giant pandas are simply irresistible.'
