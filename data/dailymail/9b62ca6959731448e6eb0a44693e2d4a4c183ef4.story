Eight months after she was found under a pile of clothes and books in a locked car, investigators have almost no clues about the death of Temple University pre-med student Nadia Malik.

The 22-year-old mother of two was found in February after a citywide search by family and police, but an autopsy completed last month was inconclusive, reports the Philadelphia Daily News. 

The family wants to know how she ended up dead in a locked car to which her boyfriend allegedly had the only key.

Tragic: Nadia Malik, 22, was attending Temple University as a pre-med student and had two daughters, ages 1 and 4, when she disappeared and turned up dead in a locked car registered to her boyfriend's parents

Her body was found at the end of February, lying on the passenger's seat inside a locked Nissan Altima registered in the name of her boyfriend, Bhupinder Singh, 25.

On the day she disappeared and the day following, Malik had texted and called her brother Fuad Malik and a friend.

Documents filed in her disappearance say that Malik told them she was with Singh and that she was being 'held against her will' and was 'trying to get away.'

Police tracked her phone to the home of Singh's parents, and found Singh attempting to flee through the back door on their arrival. 

On Singh, they found Malik's driver's license and cellphone, which Singh admitted he had used to send texts to members of the family, telling them they wouldn't see Malik again.

The Delco Times reported that Singh was arrested in Ohio on a probation violation related to a DUI conviction  and questioned by authorities.

Parents: In addition to their two daughters, Malik and Bhupinder Singh, 25, had an infant that died in 2012 under 'suspicious circumstances'

Get away: Malik called her brother and a friend, telling them she was being 'held against her will' by Singh, though police have no evidence to link Singh and have not arrested anyone in connection with her death

Singh told them that he had fought with Malik before leaving with his parents' Nissan and boarding a bus to Ohio. 

The two were the parents of two young daughters, a one-year-old who lives with Singh's parents and a four-year-old living with Malik's.

The couple also had another infant that died in 2012 under 'suspect circumstances' that the police were also investigating. 

All this still doesn't explain how Malik's body was found with no signs of injury on February 20 in a car near Philadelphia's rail terminal.

Police released a photo of the black 2007 Nissan being driven by Malik through an intersection between noon and 1 p.m.  

The next time it was seen, the car was covered in snow and had been ticketed at least eight times. 

The car had been towed to 30th Street Station as part of a snow removal plan, but the operators had not seen the body due to heavy snow covering the windows, officers said.

Police say the investigation is continuing.
