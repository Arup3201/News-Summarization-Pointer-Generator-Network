A BBC Panorama journalist sparked a 'farcical' £14,000 terror alert at the broadcaster's Salford headquarters after sending a package that was mistaken for a bomb.

Specialist bomb squad officers were called and hospitals put on standby after what was thought to be a suspicious package arrived at MediaCity earlier this week.

Explosives experts were about to carry out a controlled explosion on the parcel when it was revealed it was actually a home-made spy camera.

Terror alert: Specialist bomb squad officers were called and hospitals placed on alert after a package sent to the BBC's Salford headquarters was mistaken for a bomb

The package was sent by a Belfast-based journalist, who works for the BBC's flagship current affairs show, Panorama, to a colleague at Salford Quays.

It comprised a tiny recording device inside a plastic bottle of drink, which looked exactly like a bomb when X-rayed.

However, shortly before bomb squad officers were due to carry out a controlled explosion, Greater Manchester Police said a senior employee phoned them and claimed it was part of a 'security test' being carried out by Panorama journalists.

But in a later call, the employee claimed the package was a 'bug' that should have been sent in the BBC's internal post.

A BBC spokesman denied the package was sent as a 'security test' and said:'The package
contained filming equipment and had been sent from BBC Northern Ireland
by Royal Mail because it was needed in Salford the following day.

'This was categorically not part of an investigation testing security procedures.

'There
was a stamp on the outside of the package that showed it had been sent 
by BBC Northern Ireland and it was addressed to a producer at BBC 
Salford.

'The package was referred to the police, as it was believed it looked suspicious. 

'Everyone acted in good faith and we discussed what happened in detail with the police yesterday.'

The incident has infuriated police commissioner Tony Lloyd, who has now vowed to send the force’s £5,000 policing bill to the BBC Director General, Tony Hall.

He also labelled the blunder an ‘irresponsible’ diversion of resources.

Bomb detectives were called to Swiss Post on Broadway, near the BBC studios, shortly after 9am on Wednesday after security staff raised the alarm.

They were joined by five specialist hazard response teams from the North West Ambulance Service - trained to deal with major incidents - at a further cost of between £3,000 to £4,000.

In addition, fire crews, including three pumps, two station managers and a specialist support unit were also put on standby, costing about £5,300.

Initially, explosives experts concluded the package was either an ‘elaborate hoax’ or a real bomb - until the BBC revealed it was actually a home-made ‘bug’.

A police source said: 'The package was 
sent from Belfast and when it was put through the X-ray at the sorting 
office, it immediately aroused suspicion, because there was a device in a 
plastic bottle which had had all hallmarks of an IED (Improvised Explosive 
Device).

'It was initially treated as a serious threat or a hoax, so all the usual protocols were followed.

'Shortly
after the alarm was raised, a senior BBC employee rang to say to it was a
security test being carried out by Panorama journalists.

'But then 
the employee claimed it was all a terrible misunderstanding and the 
package should have been sent in the BBC's internal post.'

Mr Lloyd has now called for a full internal inquiry.

It is understood police interviewed several BBC employees after the incident, and concluded no criminal activity had taken place.

Call for inquiry: James Harding, the BBC's director of news, will be asked to investigate Panorama's involvement in the blunder

Mr Lloyd said: 'Whatever has happened here, whether a deliberate hoax or a stupid mistake, it caused severe disruption to the emergency services and the local community in Salford.

'The cost of this operation to the police alone is likely to be around about £5,000 and I will be sending the bill to the BBC’s Director General.

'It’s not right that the people of Greater Manchester should have to pick up the tab for Panorama’s stupidity.

'I will also be writing to James Harding, the new Director of News at the corporation, as I expect him to carry out a full review of the circumstances.

'The BBC owes it to the people of Greater Manchester to explain how Panorama caused this farce to happen, and what they will do to avoid a repeat of it.'
