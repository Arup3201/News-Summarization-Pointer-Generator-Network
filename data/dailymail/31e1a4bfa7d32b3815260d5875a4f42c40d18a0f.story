For years, Margaret Keane was kept behind locked doors - painting the pictures of the wide-eyed waifs that made her husband Walter Keane an art sensation.

Feted by celebrities during the 1950s and 60s, Walter, ever a showman, took credit for his wife's work until Margaret found the courage to come forward and tell the truth.

Her story is told in new movie Big Eyes, which premieres tonight in New York. Amy Adams plays Margaret, while Christoph Waltz is the controlling, egomaniac Walter. Both actors have won Golden Globe nominations for their work.

In a softly spoken voice, Margaret, now 87, tells MailOnline: 'I think Walter would have enjoyed every minute of it - all he cared about was being a celebrity, and of course,' she muses: 'he would have just claimed he was an artist until the very end, he would have loved the attention.'

She adds: 'Christoph did a wonderful job, I think he's portrayed Walter exactly as he was, but I think Walter was maybe a little crazier! 

'He doesn't go over the top enough to show how nutty my husband was - but he had to make it believable.'

With a soft chuckle, Margaret says: 'I think Christoph thinks HE did the paintings now!' 

After viewing the movie, directed by Tim Burton and produced by The Weinstein Corporation, Margaret admits: 'It was a very emotional experience, it was very traumatic to see it.

'To see it so big and intensified, it was quite an experience. I cried and I laughed and then I cried again, I really was in shock for about two days afterwards.

'My daughter had the same reaction, she was in shock too - it made it all come back alive to us. It was really emotionally overwhelming.'

But, she says: 'It really is wonderful to have the whole truth come out and it's very satisfying to have it really portrayed like it really happened.'

Egotistical: Margaret Keane was awarded $4 million in court in 1986 - but has never seen a penny

Margaret met Walter in 1955 when he charmed her at an outdoor art exhibition in San Francisco.

Divorced, with a daughter, they soon married - and soon Walter was passing off Margaret's paintings of the sad children as his own, along with the story that they were based on youngsters he had seen in postwar Berlin in 1946. 

One night, Margaret accompanied her husband to San Francisco beatnik cub, The Hungry i, where Walter sold the paintings as comics such as Bill Cosby and Lenny Bruce performed on stage. 

When a customer asked her 'Do you paint too?' she realized Walter was taking the credit for her work. 

Staying with Walter for the sake of her daughter - while the paintings were printed on to postcards and posters sold in millions across America - Margaret was kept a virtual prisoner in her own home while her husband frolicked in the pool outside - and brought other women into their bed.

Banned from having her own friends, she told The Guardian: 'The door was always locked, the curtains closed...when he wasn’t home he’d usually call every hour to make sure I hadn’t gone out. I was in jail.

'He was always  pressuring me to do more. 'Do one with a clown costume'.’ Or: ‘Do two children on a rocking horse.'

Behind the smiles: Walter Keane could not paint - but took credit for his wife Margaret's portrayals of wide-eyed children that became beloved by celebrities. The couple are pictured in 1963

Walter, it must be said, could not paint, a fact Margaret would seize upon, when finally in a court case in a 1986 - 21 years after they divorced - she was declared to be the true creator of the paintings.

The verdict came only after a judge asked both Margaret and Walter to paint in court. Walter claimed he had a sore shoulder and could not pick up a brush. 

Margaret was awarded $4 million, but she never saw a penny of it as Walter, an alcoholic, had drunk his fortune away. A court psychologist diagnosed him with a rare mental condition called delusional disorder.

Walter died in 2000 and making the decision to turn her life story and what was once so painful into a movie, was not an easy decision, Margaret says.

'It was difficult. I turned down four or five other offers and then the writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski came to me and I trusted them to do it the way I wanted it done, and we started talking and I liked what they did.

Now a committed Jehovah's Witness, Margaret - who has a cameo as a little old lady sitting on a park bench in Big Eyes - says: 'I would like to think all our gifts and talents and abilities come from God.

'When I was married to Walter, I did rely on my faith, at that time I hadn't yet become a Jehovah's witness, so I didn't know HIS name, but I knew there was a God.' 

Margaret still paints every day 'when I can' at her home in Napa, Northern California.

Asked about Amy Adams' portrayal of her, Margaret tells how the pair bonded before filming and said that Amy looks just like her in the movie, 'only prettier', adding: 'I knew she'd do a good job, but I had no idea it would be so fantastic.' 

The movie has already been screened at Art Basel in Miami, while art royalty including Diana Picasso and  Eileen Guggenheim attended a screening hosted by mega-art dealer Larry Gagosian with the film's Oscar-winning star Christoph Waltz at Manhattan's Crosby St. Hotel.

Introducing the film, actor Chrisoph said: 'The art is kitsch, but the Keanes' story certainly isn't.'
