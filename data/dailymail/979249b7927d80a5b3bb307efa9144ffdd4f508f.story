The withered corpse of an elephant cow lies next to the decomposing carcass of her calf in this horrifying image of what could be the worst massacre of wildlife in almost a quarter of a century.

Illegal hunters have killed more than 300 elephants, and numerous other safari animals, in Zimbabwe's largest national park by poisoning waterholes with cyanide.

The result of the indiscriminate killing has wiped out wildlife in great swathes of the once untouched wilderness of Hwange reserve which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists each year.

Conservationists have been particularly concerned by the ruthless use of cyanide by poachers to kill they prey.

The animals were struck down when 
‘salt licks’ next to pools where they drink and bathe were contaminated 
with the deadly chemical.

One hunter told The Telegraph: 'We
couldn't believe our eyes. We thought at first that they must have been
shot. There were too many to have died of thirst or hunger. We found that elephants we saw from the air were not shot, but the tusks were gone.'

After the elephants died, often 
collapsing just a few yards from the source, lions, hyenas and vultures 
which fed on their carcasses were also struck down, as were other 
animals such as kudu and buffalo that shared the same waterholes.

Elephants
need salt to survive and the hunters cynically knew they would be drawn
to the poison. Dozens of elephants were found in Zimbabwe’s Hwange 
National Park with bloody gaps where their tusks had been ripped out.

Zimbabwe
is home to some of Africa’s largest elephant herds, with half of its 
estimated 80,000 population thought to be in Hwange.

The
sprawling 5,657-square mile park is one of the few places in Africa to 
have escaped the rapid decline in the continent’s elephant population.

Demand for elephants' tusks, which 
sell for around £300 each to cross-border traders, is thought to be 
encouraging destitute villages to take the drastic action.

They
can be resold in South Africa for up to £10,000 a pair, according to 
court papers relating one recent incident, sometimes re-emerging as 
carved artefacts such as bangles in Cape Town's craft markets.

The
poisoning was first uncovered by a European hunter and his Zimbabwean 
guides who spotted a dead cow and her calf as they flew over the park in
a helicopter.

So far, 14 people have been arrested since the first poisoning was discovered.

When police arrived at the sites they found the mutilated bodies of elephants strewn around.

The
poisonings occurred in July when the national park’s security forces, 
which protect herds from the ever-present threat from ivory poachers, 
were switched to covering the Zimbabwe general election and its 
aftermath.

Since discovering
the carcasses, police and rangers have searched villages close to the 
park and recovered 19 tusks, cyanide and wire snares.

Nine alleged poachers were arrested. A South African businessman has also been accused of being behind the poisonings.

Police claim that he used a Zimbabwean farmer and an ivory buyer to distribute cyanide to villagers.

Saviour
Kasukuwere, Zimbabwe’s environment minister, said the country was 
clamping down on ivory poachers as it tries to revive its tourism 
industry which has suffered years of decline.

‘We are declaring war on the poachers,’ he said.

‘We are responding with all our might 
because our wildlife, including the elephants they are killing, are part
of the natural resources and wealth that we want to benefit the people 
of Zimbabwe.’

Mr Kasukuwere 
said he would push for stiff penalties for convicted poachers, who 
routinely get less than the nine-year jail term imposed for cattle 
rustling.

A wide range of 
other animal carcasses were also found near the contaminated watering 
holes, including buffalo, lions, vultures, antelopes and jackals.

And last night there were fears that more animals could die in coming weeks as anything that feasted on the elephants’ toxic carcasses could have also become poisoned.

A spokesman for the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force said: ‘When other animals and birds feed on the rotting elephant carcasses, they will also die from the poison. Hundreds of animals are now at risk.’

China, which accounts for 40 per cent of the world’s trade in elephant tusks, is said to be one of the main markets for the Zimbabwean ivory, where it has been regarded as a symbol of wealth and status for thousands of years.
