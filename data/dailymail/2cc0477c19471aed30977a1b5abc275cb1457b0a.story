At least nine people are dead and others injured today after an Indonesian air force plane slammed into a housing complex.

The turboprop plane erupted into a fireball after crashing into eight houses at the complex in eastern Jakarta, killing at least three people on the ground, military spokesman Rear Admiral Iskandar Sitompul said.

Raging orange flames were seen jumping several feet into the air as a huge column of black smoke billowed.

Hendra, a resident in the air force housing complex, said he ran out of his house after hearing several loud explosions and saw flames engulfing neighbours' homes.

'I could hardly believe my eyes ... there was a military plane that crashed and hit the houses!' he said.

'At once, the situation turned into chaos. All the residents fled in panic. Women and children were screaming hysterically.'

He said he helped at least five injured people, mostly with burns, to a nearby Air Force hospital. He added that he saw at least three more critically injured children brought into the hospital.

Sitompul said the Fokker F-27 was on a routine training flight when it crashed. The aircraft was declared airworthy before the training and had been skies clear, he added.

Air Force spokesman Rear Admiral Azman Yunus said there were seven people aboard the plane including the pilot, co-pilot, instructor and trainees.

All seven were rushed to the Air Force hospital, Yunus said. Later, he told Detik.com news portal that six of them were killed while one was still being treated at the hospital.

He said the Fokker F-27 had been trying to land at Jakarta's Halim airport, which serves
mainly as an air force base, after the 90-minute flight.

Private El Shinta radio reported rescuers were still searching for more possible victims among the rubble of the burning houses. A number of ambulances were parked inside the Air Force's Rawajali Complex.

The plane was built in 1958 and has been used by Indonesia's Air Force for the past 20 years.

Air accidents are common across the sprawling Indonesian 
archipelago. In May, a Russian passenger jet carrying 45 people crashed 
into the side of a volcano after taking off from the same airport. No 
survivors were found.
