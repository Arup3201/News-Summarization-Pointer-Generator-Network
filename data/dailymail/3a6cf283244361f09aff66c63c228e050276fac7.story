More than 4,000 lives a year are lost as a result of poor care in hospitals at weekends, NHS officials have warned.

A review of Britain’s emergency and urgent healthcare system today reveals that it is unsustainable, unaffordable and soaking up more than half of the Health Service budget.

Health officials are to launch plans which will attempt to tackle the deepening crisis in accident & emergency units, hospital wards and out-of-hours GP services.

Care crisis: At least 4,400 lives a year are lost in England because hospital death rates are worse at weekends, largely as a result of a shortage of senior doctors

They have collected evidence of a health system buckling under the strain and placing patients at increased risk – particularly when they need care at weekends.

The damning official report says at least 4,400 lives a year are lost in England because hospital death rates are worse at weekends, largely as a result of a shortage of senior doctors.

It warns that spiralling numbers of patients are readmitted to hospital because they were discharged too quickly, due to cuts to bed numbers.

There is also evidence of a 30 per cent rise in death rates when casualty units are crowded; widespread shortages of A&E doctors, with half of training posts unfilled for the past two years; confusion among the public about how to access urgent care; a lack of confidence in GP care.

Made our bed: The damning figures in the report were released as a review of ¿urgent and emergency care¿ in England begins

The dossier is published as NHS England begins a public consultation on a review of ‘urgent and emergency care’, which could lead to a major restructuring of the NHS.

This could see more specialist services concentrated in larger units and changes to ensure hospitals perform better at weekends, with more consultants and diagnostic tests available.

Despite widespread concerns about the failings of the non-emergency 111 telephone line, which was introduced in most parts of England this year, the official leading the review told the Daily Telegraph that the future model of emergency care will rely heavily on phone-led services.

Professor Keith Willett, the director of NHS England in charge of urgent and emergency care, said: ‘We need to redesign the system because it is not sustainable as it is.’
