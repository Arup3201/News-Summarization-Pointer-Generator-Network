Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, arrived in Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport for a charitable visit with the Djokovic Foundation at 3am last night.

She opened a refurbished primary school in Kadina Luka, near Ljiga, with tennis champ Novak Djokovic himself at 7am this morning, after he met her in Belgrade.

The school near the small town in the centre of the country is the first to have been 
renovated by the charity as part of its project Skolica Zivota (Little School Of Life).

Children's education is a cause close to the Duchess's heart.

She
 is an ambassador of the foundation and believes this 'means more than 
just going to glittery parties' and so wanted to see their work first 
hand.

Prince Andrew's former wife opened the school with Djokovic and is currently on her way back to London.

While engaging in charitable work, she also enjoys a career as a writer and television personality.

Novak Djokovic beat Milos Raonic in 
straight sets yesterday, lifting Serbia to a 2-2 tie with Canada in the 
Davis Cup semi-finals.

The Novak Djokovic Humanitarian Foundation was founded in 2007 by the tennis champ.

Its
 goal is to create a lasting change in the lives of children in need in 
Serbia, and its work takes them to the most socially underprivileged 
communities in the country.

The Duchess put her best foot forward in a pair of snazzy slipper shoes from Pretty Ballerinas yesterday.

The black slip-ons feature a bright red heart detail and are made of leather and suede.

At Â£150, they may have the royal seal of approval but they don't come cheap.

But their low heels make them a comfortable choice for travelling in.
