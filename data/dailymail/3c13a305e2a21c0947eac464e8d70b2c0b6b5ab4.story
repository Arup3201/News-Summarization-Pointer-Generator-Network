Dale Bolinger, 57, is accused of buying an axe before travelling to meet with a girl, 14, who he planned to have sex with, kill and eat

A nurse told a 14-year-old girl he planned to kill and eat her as he groomed her for sex online, a court heard.

Dale Bolinger, 57, even went to a local DIY shop and bought an axe the day before he was due to meet his victim.

But she did not turn up and he was arrested after his sick boasts were discovered by investigators on a sinister internet chat room.

Yesterday Bolinger – who had the username ‘meatmarketman’ next to a profile picture of model Naomi Campbell – went on trial accused of grooming the girl for sex.

The NHS hospital nurse was a regular user of the Dark Fetish  Network where he chatted about rape, murder and cannibalism, a crown court heard,

He claimed to have already eaten a 39-year-old black woman and a five year-old child, saying the meat of children is much more ‘tender’.

In September 2012, he exchanged messages with a girl called ‘Eva Gonza’, whose true identity has never been discovered.

The pair agreed to meet at  Ashford International rail station, Kent, but the teenager did not appear, the court was told.

Five months later, FBI agents alerted British police after discovering the internet exchanges.Bolinger, a nurse since 1979, was arrested at the Kent hospital where he worked and police found photographs of him posing with the axe on his computer.

Prosecutor Martin Yale said: ‘Dark Fetish Network is a website for those who fantasize about various things, including cannibalism.

‘It is the Crown’s case that one of the users that Bolinger befriended on it was someone he believed to be a 14-year-old girl.

‘And having discussed with her his fantasies, made arrangements to meet her with the intention of committing a sexual offence.’

‘Eva’ claimed to be a Mexican  living 
in Germany, the court heard, as Bolinger told her of perverted sexual 
acts he would perform before murdering her.

Mr
 Yale read excerpts of their internet chats in which he made ‘graphic 
references’ to sexual abuse, murder and cannibalism of women and 
children, including a baby’.

Bolinger
 said he was willing to kill his victim with the method of her choice 
and she ‘responded that she would like this to happen’.

The nurse's plan was uncovered by the FBI - who found him posting about murder, rape and cannibalism on a site called Dark Fetish Network. The organisation then alerted British police who arrested the man last year

He said: ‘I’ve got the cleaver and the experience. Really want to do it? I would want to have your body afterwards for food...’

The ‘girl’ is said to have replied: ‘I don’t know why I want this but since I was 12 I need it.’

When she said she did not believe Bolinger would go through with it, he said: ‘Meet me at Ashford train station and I WILL complete on the deal. I’ve twice eaten girls.’

Adding ‘girl back on the menu’, he said: ‘I don’t like waste and I’ll eat everything from your feet to your face.

Roasts, sausages even your offal. I’ve a great recipe for Haggis and Black (blood) pudding. You’ll be completely consumed.’

Bolinger swapped messages with other users, including one known as Hannah Hotwife, whom he sent pictures of himself with an axe.

After
 his arrest, police discovered he had bought an axe from Homebase in 
Broadstairs, Kent, before telling Eva: ‘Got the axe, you ready to get 
that train?’

Bolinger was planning to meet with Eva - who he met online - at Ashford International Station (pictured), but she failed to show up. He denies arranging to meet an underage girl and grooming

Phone records showed he went to the Ashford area on the date they agreed but later remonstrated with her when she did not show up.

The jury was told Bolinger was arrested after a probe by the FBI in New York into depraved web chat rooms.

They found an email link to his home in Kent and alerted local police. Bolinger told officers he would have called police and social services if the girl had turned up.

Mr Yale added: ‘He said people gave false information and he took everything “with a pinch of salt”.’

Bolinger, formerly of Canterbury, Kent, had ‘taken his fantasies beyond the chat room’ before, it was alleged.

In February, the court heard, he admitted putting a cloth soaked in dry cleaning fluid over the mouth of a woman friend and later boasted about this online.

He denies sexually grooming a child.

The trial continues at  Canterbury Crown Court.
