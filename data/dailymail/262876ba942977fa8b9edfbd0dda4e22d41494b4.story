A college basketball star has been suspended from his team after being arrested twice in one day for allegedly assaulting his roommate.

Zach Price, 20, who plays as a forward for Missouri University, has been banned from the court after the arrests, both over altercations involving his 23-year-old roommate and a 23-year-old woman.

Price was charged with third-degree assault and third-degree domestic assault following his first arrest by Columbia Police at 2.31am yesterday morning.

The
 victims claim that Price was following their car in his own and blocked
 the road to prevent them from leaving the area. The 6' 10" athlete is 
then alleged to have punched his roommate in the face and pushed the 
woman to the ground when she tried to intervene.

Later in the day, at 3.05pm, he was arrested again, this time on charges of second-degree assault and second-degree domestic assault, relating to an incident on Wednesday afternoon, where he is alleged to have twice rammed his car into a vehicle holding the same two people.

Missouri University's basketball coach, Frank Haith, told the Kansas City Star after the first arrest: 'We’re very disappointed in his actions. We’re still gathering information — been up all night and we’re still working toward finding out what all went on. I can tell that you we’re not real happy and we will discipline accordingly.'

The university later confirmed in a statement: 'We are aware of the situation involving Zach Price and per department policy, he is suspended immediately.'

After his first arrest, Price posted a $1,500 bond to be released from Boone City Jail. Then, after the second arrest, he had to post another $9,000 bond.

Each third degree charge carries with it a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $1,000 fine, while each second-degree offence is punishable by five years in prison and a fine of $5,000.

This means that, if found guilty of all charges, Price could face 16 years behind bars and a $12,000 fine.

Price transferred to Missouri from the championship winning Louisville team last season. As per transfer guidelines, he sat out last year but, the year before that, he started seven games for Louisville and averaged 1.4 points and 1.2 rebounds per game.
