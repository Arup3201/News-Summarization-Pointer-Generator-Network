Greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2013 driven by a surge in the level of carbon dioxide, a study claims.

Experts say carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations grew at the fastest rate since reliable global records began and have called for international action to combat climate change.

The rise in CO2 levels is outpacing fossil fuel use, suggesting that the planet's natural ability to soak up emissions of the gas may be slowing down.

‘We know without any doubt that our climate is changing and our weather is becoming more extreme due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels,’ said Michel Jarraud, the Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in Geneva, Switzerland.

‘It may be due to the reduced uptake of CO2 by the biosphere,' Mr Jarraud told a news conference, but said more research is needed. ‘If that is confirmed, it is of significant concern.’

The biosphere - which includes plants and soil - and the oceans, each absorb around a quarter of man-made CO2 emissions.

If that ratio falls, more of the planet-warming gas will remain in the atmosphere, where it can stay for hundreds of years.

The IPCC said it expects 'multiple stresses and systemic failures due to climate change' in the Mediterranean. This will increase energy costs and damage tourism from 2050.

North America: Flooding will be a major threat in this area with rain and storms moving north of New York. Southern areas are expected to experience a shortage of water.

Asia: The majority of the people directly affected by sea level rise will be in southern and eastern Asia. However, water is also expected to affect most of Asia.

Australasia: There remains uncertainty about impact in Australasia, but extreme weather is predicted. The Great Barrier Reef will continue to degrade, with warmer water bleaching more coral.

Africa: Food security will be a major issue for Africa. Crops and livestock will be affected by both flooding and drought. There will also be more soil erosion from storms.

Central and South America: Scientists expect Northern Brazil may lose 22 per cent of its annual rainfall by 2100, while the area around Chile could get a 25 per cent increase.

The WMO said that the ocean is getting rapidly more acidic, impairing its ability to absorb carbon dioxide and  the rate of ocean acidification is unprecedented at least over the past 300 million years.

WMO scientific officer Oksana Tarasova, said: ‘The total change of ocean acidity since pre-industrial (times)... is 25 percent, and six percent was done within the last 10 years.’

Even if human-made carbon emissions fall by 80 per cent by 2050, the total warming effect of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will have barely receded by 2100.

The longer fossil fuel use grows, the harder it will be to reverse the warming effect, the WMO said.

Mr Jarraud explained: ‘Past, present and future CO2 emissions will have a cumulative impact on both global warming and ocean acidification. The laws of physics are non-negotiable. We are running out of time.’

The volume of carbon dioxide - the main greenhouse gas emitted by human activities - was 396 parts per million (ppm) in 2013 - 2.9 ppm higher than in 2012.

This was the largest year-to-year increase since 1984, when reliable global records began.

Methane, the second most important greenhouse gas, reached a global average of 1824 parts per billion (ppb), increasing at a similar rate as the last five years.

The other main contributor, nitrous oxide, reached 325.9 ppb, growing at a rate comparable to the average over the past decade.

Greenhouse gas emissions are rising mainly due to industrial growth in China, India and other emerging economy nations, according to the WMO.

Almost 200 governments have agreed to work out a deal to limit global warming at a summit in Paris next year.

Experts aim to keep global warming within 2°C (3.6°F) above pre-industrial times – goals that were set by the UN in 2010.

Mr Jarraud said that if this was achieved, it would ‘give our planet a chance and ... our children and grandchildren a future’.

An IPCC report that was leaked last month, said that Global warming is impacting 'all continents and across the oceans'. This map details some of the predicted affects of climate change in different continents

Global warming is already here, man-made and dangerous, according to an IPCC report that was leaked last month.

The report, which is the most severe warning issued yet, also claims it is increasingly likely that the heating trend could be irreversible.

Global warming, it says, is impacting 'all continents and across the oceans' and further pollution from heat-trapping gases will raise the likelihood of severe impacts for mankind.

The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last month sent governments a final draft of its synthesis report, which combined three earlier, gigantic documents by group.

There is little in the report that wasn't in the other more-detailed versions, but the language is more stark and the report attempts to connect the different scientific disciplines studying problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas.

It says: 'Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.'

Depending on circumstances and values, 'currently observed impacts might already be considered dangerous.'

The report mentions extreme weather and rising sea levels, such as heat waves, flooding and droughts and raises the idea that climate change will worsen violent conflicts and refugee problems and could hinder efforts to grow more food.

It claims that ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life.

Without changes in greenhouse gas emissions, 'climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century,' according to the IPCC.
