Sam Burgess remains on course for his first experience of national service in rugby union at the end of this month, despite being ruled out of Bath’s encounter with Toulouse on Sunday. 

The West Country club’s 25-year-old cross-code recruit from South Sydney Rabbitohs was absent from the line-up announced on Friday for the Champions Cup Pool 4 crunch at Stade Ernest Wallon. His place at No 12 has been taken by England centre Kyle Eastmond, who resumes his alliance with Jonathan Joseph.

There was no official explanation, but Sportsmail understands that Burgess suffered a minor leg injury in the final minutes of the victory over Wasps a week ago.

He was named man of the match following his try-scoring contribution in that fixture, so demotion seems unlikely. Instead, it is thought that he has been rested by head coach Mike Ford, in order to be fit for the home clash with Glasgow next weekend.

Both player and club are optimistic that this will be a one-week absence, and that will be welcome news for Stuart Lancaster. The England head coach had long since decided that Burgess will start at inside centre for the Saxons against Ireland Wolfhounds in Cork on January 30.

Lancaster has acclaimed the newcomer for his ‘terrific’ impact since switching from league and is understood to be determined to bring him into the national set-up at the earliest opportunity.

Stuart Lancaster was hoping to draft Burgess into the England squad for the November internationals until the rugby league convert 's severe facial injuries suffered in the NRL Grand Final delayed his start in union 

The England management had hoped to invite Burgess into camp during the autumn campaign until his facial injuries in the NRL Grand Final delayed his start in union.

Now, with the Saxons appearance as the next stage of his rapid transition, the Yorkshireman is likely to be involved in Test training before the end of the Six Nations. A place in the expanded pre-World Cup training squad is inevitable, if he stays in one piece.

While Lancaster will be relieved that Burgess is not out for long, he will have growing concerns about Courtney Lawes. The Northampton lock hasn’t played since the East Midlands derby against Leicester on December 20 and is not in the side to face the Ospreys on Sunday.

Courtney Lawes is still suffering with an ankle problem and will not feature against the Ospreys on Sunday 

Saints have recalled captain Dylan Hartley after his latest ban but Lawes rolled his ankle in that showdown with the Tigers. His extended spell of inactivity is far from ideal for England, especially with Joe Launchbury already ruled out of the Six Nations.

Harlequins and Wasps engage in an all-English duel at The Stoop this evening, with Pool Two coming down to a three-way tussle for qualification also involving Leinster, who visit the Ricoh Arena next weekend.

Dai Young is encouraged that his Wasps team still have their destiny in their own hands.

The director of rugby said: ‘You don’t need to be a mathematician to work out that if we win both, we’re through. But it’s not easy.’
