The omens are not good for England as they prepare to take on Uruguay in their pivotal World Cup game on Thursday.

Win and qualification is in their hands. Lose and, chances are, they'll be on the plane home.

One slightly unexpected major hurdle for the Three Lions, though, could be the curse of ITV.

Harrowing: Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney will be hoping to beat the curse of ITV on Thursday night

Cursors: Luis Suarez and Edison Cavani will be hoping to bring pain to the Three Lions

And, for once, it has nothing to do with Adrian Chiles.

The record shows that, when England have played at the World Cup on the commercial broadcaster, their record is significantly worse than it is when they are televised on the BBC.

Since the 1982 World Cup, ITV have shown 10 World Cup first round group stage games, of which England have failed to win seven (six draws, one defeat).

Switching channels to BBC, however, and England fare far better with a record of eight wins out of 12 - although one of their two defeats was the 2-1 loss at the hands of Italy last Saturday.

Rarity: Peter Crouch scored against Trinidad & Tobago the last time England won on ITV in the first round

Pain: What happened the only time ITV have exclusively screened an England World Cup knockout...

Perhaps most disturbingly, though, ITV have shown just one England first round group stage win in the last 32 years, and that was the 2-0 victory over minnows Trinidad & Tobago in 2006.

England didn't play a knockout game in 1982, due to the thankfully defunct second group stage (BBC and ITV both screened a 0-0 draw apiece), but since Mexico '86 ITV have shown just one knockout tie exclusively - which ended in heartache after losing on penalties to Argentina in 1998.

It's a harrowing record to say the least, and it's a curse that will hopefully be broken against Uruguay on Thursday night.
