Ignored:  Peter Tizzard, 73, says his calls for assistance went unanswered at Dorset County Hospital

An elderly cancer patient claims he was forced to call 999 from his hospital bed after staff ignored his calls for help.

Peter Tizzard, 73, was in the care of Dorset County Hospital when he suddenly experienced severe pain, and pressed his bedside call button and shouted out for assistance.

Mr Tizzard, who suffers from prostate cancer, claims he saw no other way to get help, and used his mobile phone to make an emergency 999 call.

The emergency operator called Mr Tizzard's ward at the Dorset County Hospital, and they sent a doctor to see him.

Mr Tizzard says he does not blame the staff for not coming to his aid quickly enough, saying the ward was understaffed and the doctors and nurses ‘run ragged’.

Mr Tizzard, from Weymouth, Dorset, said: ‘I kept shouting but no one came to see me. I don't know how long I was shouting for.

‘I thought, “what am I going to do?” Calling 999 was the only way someone was coming to help me.

‘I told the operator that I didn't want an ambulance - I just wanted to be wheeled down to A and E so I could be seen to.

‘All the nursing staff, the doctors, were wonderful - they just don't have enough staff. They're run ragged.

‘There were four nursing staff looking after between 28 and 34 people. How can you expect them to be able to do that?’

Dorset County Hospital denied that there were problems with staffing at the hospital on the night of the 29th March, and says that Mr Tizzard chose to dial 999 instead of using the call bell system.

A spokeswoman said: ‘Lulworth Ward was 
fully staffed that night and there were no problems with call bells 
being answered in a timely way.

‘We understand that Mr Tizzard felt the ward was very busy and believed it would help staff if he dialled 999 and alerted emergency services rather than using the call bell system.

Disagreement:  Dorset County Hospital says said the 999 operator called the Mr Tizzard's ward directly and they sent a doctor to see him, as there was no problem with staffing on the night in question

‘We appreciate Mr Tizzard was trying to be helpful but this course of action was not necessary.

‘The ambulance service contacted the ward and the situation was explained. No ambulance was dispatched.

‘The matron and ward sister met with Mr Tizzard daily during his stay and ensured he was able to contact them directly if he felt he was not being attended to promptly enough.

‘We are really disappointed that Mr Tizzard felt it was necessary to take the action he did given the effort the ward staff and matron had taken to ensure he received good care.’

Last month, Dorset County hospitals were accused of wasting taxpayers’ money on 'non-jobs', after it emerged they employed a part-time ‘arts in hospital co-ordinator’ on a £30,000 salary.

The investigation revealed that the NHS is spending £46million a year on non-jobs such as ‘play and communication workers’, ‘carbon managers’ and ‘car park environmental officers’.
