Pledge: Criminal justice major Tyler Lawrence, 19, lost a testicle following a fraternity initiation ritual in which he was struck in his privates

A 19-year-old Ohio college student pledging to a fraternity has lost a testicle during an alleged hazing ritual.

The incident took place on the night of October 30 inside the Gamma Phi Gamma house, dubbed 'Gobbler House,' located off the Wilmington College campus.

Tyler Lawrence, 19, was pledging to the Greek organization along with two other young men.

According to a police affidavit, about 20 Gamma Phi Gamma members either actively participated in the ritual or watched from the sidelines.

Documents cited by The Smoking Gun stated that Lawrence and the other two pledges were blindfolded and led down into the basement of 'Gobbler House,' which had been filled with about 3 inches of water.

The trio of pledges were then ordered to lie down on the wet floor and pretend like they were swimming.

Afterwards, the men were instructed to remove all of their clothes except for the blindfold.

As the students stood naked in the basement, one of the fraternity members allegedly rubbed a substance similar to the muscle balm Icy Hot on their nipples, backs, buttocks and scrotums.

As part of the initiation, the pledges had limburger cheese stuffed into their mouths and were ordered to simulate a sexual act with a 'ball of stuffing.’

Things took a dangerous turn when, according to the police affidavit, the fraternity members took towels and shirts that had their ends tied in knots and began hitting the pledges.

Lawrence was struck in the testicles and crumpled to the ground, clutching his injured groin in pain, the affidavit stated.

The 19-year-old criminal justice major was then helped to his feet, and the rite continued with the brothers stuffing bananas soaked in vinegar into the mouths of the three pledges, who were told that they were eating excrement.

Following the 'Gobbler House' initiation, Lawrence complained of severe pain in his groin and was rushed to Clinton Memorial Hospital, where doctors had to cut off a testicle that was damaged in the alleged hazing.

The police affidavit also noted that the teenager suffered bruising and contusions to much of his upper body.

The following day, police officers arrived at the off-campus frat house armed with a search warrant and seized towels with balled ends, icy-hot balm and other items allegedly used in the initiation.

Officials at the Quaker-affiliated liberal arts college have suspended the Gamma Phi Gamma fraternity, which has been active on campus for a century. It is nicknamed ‘Gobbler House’ because its mascot is a turkey.

Students who may have participated in the suspected hazing incident could face suspension or expulsion from Wilmington College if convicted of criminal offenses.

Lawrence, however, has come to the fraternity's defense, denying allegations of hazing and calling what happened a 'freak accident.'

‘Everything is being hyped up,’ he told the station WKRC.

Lawrence said he has been accepted into the fraternity after completing the rite of passage, and his parents supported his decision to stay in Gamma Phi Gamma.  

‘We're all just sticking together as brothers do,’ he said. ‘I love every one of those guys in there [and] they all love me.’
