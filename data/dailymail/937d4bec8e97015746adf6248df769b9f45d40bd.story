Mario Balotelli’s future at Liverpool was shrouded in mystery on Wednesday night after the frontman posted a cryptic message on social media. 

The Reds attacker was an unused substitute during Liverpool's 2-0 win against Burnley and has struggled for form at Anfield since arriving in the summer.

The Italy international has managed just one Premier League goal since his £16million switch from AC Milan and has come in for criticism throughout his spell on Merseyside.

Shortly after the win against the Clarets, Balotelli took to Instagram and claimed 'Someone doesn't like me' but failed to specify before commenting on how proud he was of the Liverpool team.

Posting an image of his team-mates celebrating on Wednesday night, Balotelli said: 'Someone doesn't like me but differently of what they say about me I'm a team player and I'm so proud of my team, of this win and of these fans! Let's keep going. Bravi Ragazzi!!! YNWA !!!'  

Liverpool's win - courtesy of goals from Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge - saw them keep the pressure on rivals Arsenal and Manchester United as the trio battle for a place in the top four.
