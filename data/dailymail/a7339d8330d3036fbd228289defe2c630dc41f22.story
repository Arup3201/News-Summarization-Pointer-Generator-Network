This is the moment an 80-year-old grandmother was nearly killed when a shop sign fell 8ft, knocking her unconscious as she strolled down a busy high street.

The four-stone (25kg) sign broke free from the fascia of a Mountain Warehouse store in Falmouth, Cornwall, and landed on Patricia Tutton - who suffered a fractured cheekbone and spinal damage.

Three years on the company that fitted the heavy sign - New Life Signs Installations, of Swindon, Wiltshire - has only been given a police caution for its sloppy work that led to Mrs Tutton’s injuries.

She said her wounds wrecked her quality of life, leaving her unable to drive and barely able to dress herself. She added that doctors told her if the sign had fallen on a child it would have killed them.

Mrs Tutton said: ‘I can only remember walking down Market Street and the next thing I knew I was in hospital. I don’t remember anything else.

‘My face was black and blue, I had four fractures around my right eye, a cut on my eye and my head and quite a dent on my head. My spine has got a kink in it.’

Cornwall Council found that New Life Signs Installations had not fulfilled its basic duty of care to the public, with investigators discovering that the sign had been poorly fitted.

They also found the fixings used to attach it to the store’s flimsy MDF (medium-density fibreboard) frontage were inadequate.

The firm was due to be prosecuted last 
week at Bodmin Magistrates’ Court but bosses agreed to accept a caution 
under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.

Outdoor clothing chain Mountain Warehouse was not implicated in the accident on November 29, 2011, which saw the sign fall on her head. It left Mrs Tutton unable to do her activities such as bowls, gardening and ballroom dancing.

She said: ‘I was very fit and active. I used to be a busy and active person, which has changed dramatically. I feel like a different woman.

‘My life has come to a complete 
standstill. I feel lucky to be alive. I’ve still got my family around 
and I can still see my grandchildren.’

Lee McDowell, senior environmental health
 officer at Cornwall Council, said: ‘I was shocked at how poorly the 
sign was fitted, and it was only luck that prevented it from killing 
someone.

‘You didn’t need to be an experienced 
sign fitter to realise screwing a heavy sign to a thin fascia board made
 up of predominantly MDF was not going to stay in place for long and 
would present a danger to passers-by.’

Mrs
 Tutton lives in a £280,000 detached house with her partner Eddy Tatton 
in the village of Mabe Burnthouse, four miles west of Falmouth.

The
 mother of three, a former domestic supervisor at a hospital, said of 
the sign-making firm escaping with just a caution: ‘I don't think a 
caution is enough. I'm surprised they got away with that.

‘We could have been dealing with a death had a child been walking along the pavement. That sign was solid wood. The ambulance man said I was lucky to be alive.’

Mrs Tutton is awaiting the outcome of a claim for compensation. Cornwall Council said that New Life Signs Installations was ordered to pay its legal costs as well as accepting a caution.

New Life Signs Installations is a business run from a £170,000 semi-detached bungalow in Swindon. It has one director listed in records - Albertus Viljoen, a 37-year-old man originally from South Africa.

A spokesman for the company declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline today.
