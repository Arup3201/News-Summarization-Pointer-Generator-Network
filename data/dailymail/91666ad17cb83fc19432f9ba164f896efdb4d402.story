The three prime suspects in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann had worked at the resort where she vanished, it was claimed yesterday.

Details of the men’s alleged links to the Ocean Club resort in the Algarve were revealed in Portuguese newspapers with close contacts with local police.

They emerged two days after Portuguese police had a high-level meeting with a visiting Scotland Yard delegation. The revelations come amid growing optimism at New Scotland Yard that detectives are on the brink of a major breakthrough in the case.

Investigation: British police officers arrive in downtown Faro, Portugal, carrying documents believed to be related to three men who may be connected with the disappearance of toddler Madeline McCann in 2007

Abducted: Madeleine McCann was three when she vanished from her parents' apartment in Praia da Luz

Breakthrough: British officers met for three hours with Portuguese counterparts about new leads

Investigation: The officers met police in the city of Faro, whose jurisdiction includes the town of Praia de Luz

Wearing sunglasses and carrying suitcases full of documents, the officers arrived in Portugal on Monday

At the meeting, Met detectives 
reportedly requested bank details of the men, who are thought to have 
carried out a series of break-ins at the resort in the run-up to 
Maddie’s disappearance.

They are also said to have asked local officers to quiz the unnamed trio and search their homes.

Although
 local media reported the men had been employed at the Ocean Club 
complex in Praia da Luz, it was not clear whether they were working 
there at the time Maddie  went missing in May 2007.

Nor was it clear whether they were directly employed by the company Mark Warner, which runs the resort, or through a contractor.

The
 latest twist in the investigation came weeks after the Mail exclusively
 revealed Scotland Yard had identified three burglars as prime suspects.

One theory is that the burglars raided the McCanns’ flat and were panicked into snatching the youngster when she woke up.

Detectives: The officers had a morning meeting in Portugal before heading for lunch

Time for new leads: Analysis of mobile phone data suggests three burglars were 'very close' to the holiday flat when the three-year-old girl vanished. Pictured: The Scotland Yard detectives

Foreign trip: The investigators were seen in a crowded street in the city of Faro, where they met local police

Probe: The men walked into a building in the city centre after they were spotted in a crowded street

Analysis
 of mobile phone data suggests the men were close to the scene of her 
abduction, at the time she went missing, and were in close contact in 
the hours that followed.

Portuguese
 police chiefs confirmed a three-hour meeting between the Policia 
Judiciaria, which is investigating the case, and a Met team led by 
Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood had taken place on Tuesday – but 
refused to say what had been discussed.

Local
 newspaper Correio da Manha reported: ‘The British want Portuguese 
authorities to interrogate and search the homes of three former Ocean 
Club employees. They also requested access to the bank accounts of the 
three suspects to see if there were any large deposits made after the 
child disappeared.’

The 
Ocean Club had about 130 Portuguese employees and 30 British when 
Madeleine vanished. All the Britons are thought to have left.

Mystery: It is almost seven years since Madeleine McCann vanished in the holiday resort of Praia da Luz

The
 McCanns’ lawyer in Portugal, Rogerio Alves, said he was aware Scotland 
Yard wanted to question three suspects but described reports that 
arrests were imminent as ‘improbable’.

Progress
 in the probe has been thwarted by the Portuguese authorities’ 
reluctance to agree to a formal joint investigation. And, as none of the
 burglars is British, the Met does not have jurisdiction to arrest them 
in Portugal.

Behind the scenes, diplomatic discussions have taken place to resolve the issue so UK detectives can be based in Portugal.

Maddie’s
 parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, of Rothley, Leicestershire,   declined 
to comment on the latest developments yesterday, as did a spokesman for 
Mark Warner.
