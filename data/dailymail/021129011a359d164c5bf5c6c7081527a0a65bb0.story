A 41-mile stretch of highway under construction in Texas could be the first U.S. road to have an 85 mile per hour speed limit, according to the Texas Department of Transportation.

Texas State Highway 130 will run between between Austin and Seguin, a town just east of San Antonio, with the aim of taking traffic loads off of Interstate 35.

The major north-south highway was named the fourth most congested road in the state by the Texas Department of Transportation last year.

Most of Highway 130 is built - and speed
limits are posted at 80 mph - with the remaining section set to open 
before the end of this year.

'We'll definitely take a look at that stretch, and we will conduct speed studies to see what that speed limit will be,' Darren McDaniel, the Texas Department of Transportation's speed management director, said at a conference this week.

The agency is looking at the toll road's topography, checking what speed most drivers are traveling on existing parts of the highway and ensuring the access points and cross-sections would still be safe with an 85 mph speed limit, spokesman Mark Cross added.

The Texas Legislature passed a law last year that allowed speed limits of up to 85 mph on newly constructed highways that were determined to be safe enough to allow such speeds.

Texas and Utah are currently the only states with speed limits of 80 mph.

The 85 mph speed limit would be the 
fastest posted maximum in the Western Hemisphere and the second fastest 
in the world, according to Rhino Car Hire, a European car rental 
company. It said a speed of 140 kilometers per hour, or about 86 mph, is
posted on some roads in Poland.

Should the US raise highway speed limits to 85 mph?

Before the federally mandated 55 mph speed limit was approved in 1974, several Western states had high speed limits, and Montana and Nevada had some roads with no posted speed limits at all. Germany's Autobahn system has no posted speed limits for passenger cars, but speed is restricted for other types of vehicles.

Critics say higher speed limits will lead to more fatal accidents, but McDaniel said the safest roads are ones where all motorists are traveling the same speed.

Studies of drivers on that stretch of highway now show most are traveling about 85 mph, he said.

'The more people we can get to travel a uniform speed, the safer are the conditions that will exist,' McDaniel said on Wednesday at the annual Texas Transportation Institute road safety conference in San Antonio.

Officials first proposed the 85 mph speed limit on a now cancelled toll road project, in hopes that it would convince more motorists to choose toll roads, and lessen congestion on free stretches of highway.
