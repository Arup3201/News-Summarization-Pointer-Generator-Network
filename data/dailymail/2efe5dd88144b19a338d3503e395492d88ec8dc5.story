'It stinks': Sally Bercow is accused of exploiting her husband's position in accepting the 'dream job' offer in Barbados

She’s posed naked except for a bedsheet, with the Houses of Parliament as her backdrop. She’s taken part in Celebrity Big Brother, and made a tabloid TV show about her friendship with My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star Paddy Doherty. She’s even admitted to being a former binge-drinker who had a string of one-night stands.

You could be forgiven for thinking that Sally Bercow has already caused her husband, Commons Speaker John Bercow, enough embarrassment.

But now she has given him a fresh headache after accepting a celebrity public speaking engagement, which she said came with a fee of ‘about £2,000’ and a trip to the West Indies.

The Institute of Travel and Tourism offered her the ‘dream job’ just weeks after her husband allowed the organisation to host a Christmas cocktail party in his official Commons apartment. One Tory MP said the arrangement ‘stunk’ – and accused 42-year-old Mrs Bercow of profiting from her position.

Last night, the attention-loving Mrs Bercow claimed her £2,000 fee for the hour-long talk was ‘not a fortune’ – but admitted she leapt at the chance to address delegates at the five-star Barbados Hilton.

She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘They said, “Will you come and speak in Barbados? We will pay for your flights and accommodation.”

‘I thought about it for five seconds and said, “Yes, please, I’ll bite your arm off.” I’m not crazy.’

She added that she was unaware whether the flights would be business class, saying: ‘No idea. It doesn’t matter to me. I am quite happy to go economy.

‘I’ll take what I’m given.’

The offer to Mrs Bercow came after the trade body was permitted to hold two Christmas parties at Mr Bercow’s grace-and-favour Westminster home, one in 2010 and another last year. At the 2010 event, Mr Bercow himself reportedly put in an ‘unexpected’ appearance and showed guests the apartment’s ceremonial four-poster bed. Mrs Bercow has previously spoken of how ‘sexy’ the flat feels.

Last night, Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘It is good that the Speaker uses his position to encourage the British tourist industry, but he and his wife need to be very careful not to put themselves in a position where the appearance is given that they are getting an advantage for helping this organisation.’

One Tory MP privately accused Labour-supporting Mrs Bercow of profiting from her privileged position, saying: ‘I’m afraid this looks as though she’s getting work on the back of events being held at her husband’s official residence. It stinks.’

Mrs Bercow hit back, saying there was ‘nothing dodgy’ about the offer of what she admits is a dream job.

She said she had never attended an ITT event, and the offer came on the back of her Channel 5 documentary with Mr Doherty, an Irish traveller. She added that it was ‘nonsense’ to bar her from getting work from organisations that have held events in the apartment where she lives with the Speaker and their three children.

She said: ‘To say I can’t make a living or earn any income from completely independent approaches from organisations that happen to have been into Parliament is ridiculous.’

Mrs Bercow said the engagement in Barbados would be her debut on the lucrative international speaking circuit. In taking it, she is following in the footsteps of Tony Blair’s wife Cherie, who addressed the conference three years ago.

Advance publicity for the £485-a-head event in June says: ‘Sally will give her take on being an independent woman balancing a career with family life whilst living in the goldfish bowl of Westminster.’

By coincidence, Mrs Blair’s book about life in No 10 was called The Goldfish Bowl. The ITT blurb describes Mrs Bercow as an ‘outspoken member of the Labour party’ and adds: ‘Her experiences, media controversies and thoughts on Parliament, politics and politicians making the news will be well worth a listen!’ Mrs Bercow was unclear what she was supposed to talk about, but asked if it would involve any tourism expertise, she said: ‘Oh god, no.’

Last night, ITT chairman Steven Freudmann insisted there was no connection between the events held at Speaker’s House, which were charity fundraisers, and hiring Mrs Bercow.

A spokesman for Mr Bercow said he had ‘no involvement with his wife’s professional diary’, adding: ‘Around 100 events are allowed in Speaker’s House each year for educational, charitable or Parliamentary purposes. The event in December 2011 was held to promote the Just A Drop charity. Neither Mr Speaker nor Mrs Bercow attended.

‘There is absolutely no connection between the event and the separate speaking invitation.’
