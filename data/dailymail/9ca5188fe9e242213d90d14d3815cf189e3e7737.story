David Cameron faced a new Tory revolt last night after a second Conservative MP admitted he has secretly asked for a vote aimed at sacking him as leader.

Anti-gay marriage MP Andrew Bridgen confirmed to The Mail on Sunday that he has written to party chiefs calling for a vote of 'no confidence' in Mr Cameron.

It is believed that as many as 25 of the 46 Tory MPs needed to trigger a vote on the Prime Minister's future have now sent letters to senior backbencher Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory 1922 Committee.

Revolt: Andrew Bridgen has launched a bid to oust Prime Minister David Cameron

Businessman Mr Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, said the Tories could lose the next Election unless Mr Cameron was replaced.

'There is a credibility problem with the current leader,' he said. 'It's like being in an aeroplane. The pilot doesn't know how to land it. We can either do something about it . . . or sit back, watch the in-flight movies and wait for the inevitable.'

Mr Bridgen, 48, refused to say who he believed should replace Mr Cameron. But he is known to be close to Windsor Tory MP Adam Afriyie, who, as The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this year, has been linked to a Conservative leadership plot.

Ambitious Mr Afriyie denies he is trying to bring down Mr Cameron, but is seen by some Conservatives as a potential future leader. Mr Bridgen enraged Downing Street last week after he wrote a letter signed by 80 Tory MPs challenging Mr Cameron's policy on the civil war in Syria.

Amid reports that the Prime Minister is about to supply arms to Syrian rebels, Mr Bridgen and his supporters delivered a letter to No 10 demanding the right for MPs to have the final say on the issue, not Mr Cameron.

In trouble? David Cameron could be set to face a 'vote of no confidence' in his leadership from party members

No 10 saw it as an attack on Mr Cameron.

'Bridgen has shown little interest in foreign affairs before. This was a feeble excuse to have a go at the PM,' said a Cameron supporter.

The letter was sent to No 10 last week by Mr Bridgen and co-author, fellow Right-wing Eurosceptic MP John Baron, who led the Queen's Speech revolt against the Coalition over a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU.

Mr Bridgen's stand against Mr Cameron emerged as a poll commissioned by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft showed that, for the first time, Mr Cameron's ratings are lagging behind those of his party.

Mr Bridgen has voiced doubts about Mr Cameron privately for some time, but the gay marriage issue was the last straw. He wrote to Mr Brady calling for a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron as the legislation was being debated in the Commons last month.

Mr Cameron's allies last night dismissed Mr Bridgen's demand for a 'no confidence' vote as 'irrelevant'. One said: 'The vast majority of Conservative MPs are solidly behind the PM. There are always one or two mavericks who are out to cause trouble.

The only other MP to write such a letter didn't fare too well.' This comment was a sarcastic reference to Patrick Mercer who, as revealed by this newspaper in 2011, was the first Tory MP to be identified as having called for a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron.

He was forced to resign the Tory whip a week ago after the BBC claimed he had broken the rules on lobbying by MPs. It means his 'no confidence' letter is invalid.

Nevertheless, Mr Bridgen's protest letter demanding a vote on Syria produced almost immediate success, with Ministers promising there would be a vote by MPs.

Vocal: Tory Adam Afriyie has already called on the party to prepare to oust Cameron

I did not seek to make my name public, but since I have been asked to confirm that I have called for a no confidence vote in the Prime Minister, I think it is wrong to deny it.

I informed the Tory whips office in advance that I was putting in my letter of no confidence. It is with regret that I have called for such a vote.

I have come to the view that although many of our policies are right, whether on welfare reform or reducing the deficit, there is a credibility problem with the current leader. The voters think we have many of the right messages â€“ they just don't believe the messenger.

In some cases, the messages are wrong
 or badly handled. By pressing ahead with gay marriage and delaying a 
promise on an EU referendum until he was forced to do so, Mr Cameron has
 fuelled the rise of UKIP. We have created our own nemesis.

I
 believe the Prime Minister has blundered by forcing through the gay 
marriage vote. This was something we did not have to do. The PM marched 
us on to the guns over this and it has cost us a lot of support.

I
 know No 10 denied that anyone close to the Prime Minister regarded 
ordinary party members as 'swivel-eyed loons', but I am afraid that some
 people at the top of the party do perceive Tory grassroots activists in
 this way.

There are 
questions over the style of leadership we have had in the past few 
years. In my view, loyalty has to run in both directions â€“ from the 
bottom to the top and the top to the bottom. People will ask whether now
 is the wrong time to consider a change of leader.

But I think the situation is this: it's like being in an aeroplane.

The
 pilot doesn't know how to land it. We can either do something about it 
before the crash, or sit back, watch the in-flight movies and wait for 
the inevitable.
