Clarke Carlisle has admitted he threw himself in front of a lorry in an attempt to take his own life in December.

Speaking for the first time since the incident that left him in hospital for six weeks, the 35-year-old former Premier League footballer and chairman of the PFA said he had been battling serious depression for 18 months.

Sportsmail revealed that Carlisle had been critically injured when he was struck by a lorry near his home on the morning of December 22 on the A64, near York. The married father of two had to be airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary, with North Yorkshire Police confirming that an investigation was under way after a collision that ‘involved a male pedestrian and a lorry’.

Carlisle finally returned home from hospital last Friday and, speaking to The Sun newspaper, said his life spiralled out of control after being told by ITV he was losing his £100,000-a-year Champions League pundit role. He says he went straight to a casino and blew in one night what money he and his wife had before, only hours later on December 20, being charged with drink-driving.

‘I had to die,’ he said. ‘This wasn’t escaping or running away. This was the perfect answer. It made everyone happy and it ticked every box.’

He said he had sat in the police cell and concluded that he could not let his children ‘have a criminal father’. He said he walked out of the police station having decided he ‘had to die’.

Carlisle says he then vanished for 40 hours, sleeping rough while planning his suicide. Having found a spot on the A64, he then stepped over a barrier and jumped towards an oncoming lorry ‘like a shoulder charge’.

He claims to have also contemplated drowning, falling under a bus, diving under a train; even hanging himself at York City, where he had once played. ‘Nothing could be left to chance,’ he said.

At one stage he found himself standing on railway tracks staring at an oncoming train. ‘I thought, “That’s not going quick enough — you’re not going to die this way and it has to be definitive”. At the last second I threw myself out of the way.’

Only after that did he walk to the A64. ‘Throwing yourself in front of a truck is a very difficult thing to do,’ he said. ‘I saw the big truck. There was no rush. I walked up to the barrier, stepped over it casually. The lorry was about 20 yards away.

‘I thought “You’re the one”. I took two steps into the road and then jumped into the truck, like a full shoulder charge. I can remember that impact. Bang. Then lights out. I don’t know how long had passed. It must have been a few minutes. 

Carlisle was recently released from hospital six weeks after he was injured in a collision with a lorry

‘I opened my eyes and I could see my hands in front of me and there’s blood dripping down them. I thought, “You’re kidding me”.’

At hospital it was discovered he had suffered only cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and a shattered left knee.

He said he had ‘overwhelming feelings of shame, guilt and embarrassment’

On Christmas Day, Carlisle was admitted to a psychiatric unit in Harrogate and placed on suicide watch. He is now having counselling, with The Sun claiming the police are taking no further action over the A64 crash.

On Wednesday night, Carlisle’s wife, Gemma, said on Twitter: ‘We send our love and thoughts to the lorry driver & family. It could have been anyone and Clarke is desperately sorry that it was him. Suicide & depression is not selfish. It’s a serious illness where your world & reality are warped.’
