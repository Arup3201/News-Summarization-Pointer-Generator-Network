West Brom have completed a double swoop for Australian defender Jason Davidson and Costa Rica international Cristian Gamboa as they continue their busy summer of dealings.

Davidson joins from Dutch side Heracles on a two-year deal while Gamboa arrives from Rosenborg on a three-year deal, becoming the seventh and eighth signings for West Brom during this window.  

On the Davidson signing, head coach Alan Irvine told the club's official website: 'I'm delighted we've been able to complete a deal for Jason. He had a fantastic World Cup when he performed very well against three top teams.

'Jason is a good defender who has lots of energy, gets forward well and will give us competition for places at left-back with Sebastien Pocognoli.

'Due to contractual issues with his former club, there's been a delay in Jason coming. This means he hasn't trained properly since the World Cup so he's going to need a little bit of time to catch up before we can expect him to perform at the levels he's capable of.

'I spoke to Tim Cahill about Jason and he recommended him very, very highly both as a player and character. Tim sees him as a young player who will do extremely well in England and develop even further.'

Davidson, who played in Australia's three World Cup group matches, believed he had finished his contract with Heracles and had become a free agent.

Heracles, however, informed Davidson they had triggered a one-year option on that deal and he remained their player.

To get the deal over the line, Albion have paid an undisclosed fee for the 23-year-old left-back, who has signed a two-year contract, with an option in the club's favour for a further season.

After signing Gamboa, who was granted a work permit to complete his move, Irvine added: 'As I commented the other day, it would have been amazing if Cristian had not been granted a work permit and we’re obviously satisfied with today’s outcome.

'Cristian is a player I was extremely impressed by during the World Cup.

'We faced stiff competition from other Premier League clubs for his services but we've managed to convince Cristian that West Bromwich Albion is the best club for him to join.

'Cristian is a quick, aggressive defender with good energy levels. He gets up and down the pitch really well and we believe he will continue to improve.'
