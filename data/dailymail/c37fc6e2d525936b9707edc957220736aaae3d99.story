There’s nothing like grabbing an ice-cream or lolly on a hot day.

And now scientists have worked out the exact temperature it needs to be before holidaymakers fancy a frozen treat.

As soon as the thermostat hits 18C, sales of lollies, choc ices and cornets increase, according to a study.

Time for an ice cream! Ice lolly sales soar as soon as the temperature hits 18C, according to research

Jon Goldstone, vice-president of brand building in the UK and Ireland for Unilever, whose scientists carried out the research, said when summer days hit even higher temperatures than that demand soars.

He said: ‘Eighteen degrees Celsius is the magic number - when the thermometer hits 18, this is when we start to see a spike in consumer demand.

‘After prolonged periods of 18-plus temperatures, we usually see a ten-fold increase in sales in the out-of-home market.

‘Ice cream is the most seasonal food for summer, and when the sun comes out it's not surprising that we see a direct correlation between the temperature and the number of ice creams eaten.’

The company, which owns a host of favourites including Wall's, Magnum, Solero, Twister and Viennetta, set out to discover the exact temperature the weather had to reach before sun-worshippers sought out an ice cream treat.

Chilling out: More than 3,200 tonnes of ice cream were made every week throughout July

Thanks to the hot summer, sales have soared and the UK's biggest ice cream factory, in Gloucestershire, had to increase shifts on most of its production lines.

It was churning out 3,243 tonnes of ice cream every week at the rate of 0.45 tonnes per minute.

One of the brands made there, Magnum, is currently being produced at the rate of 1,125 per minute.

For years Britons lagged behind their European counterparts in ice cream consumption, Unilever said, but sales are up 1.5 per cent since June last year.

However, frozen yoghurt is rapidly out-pacing ice cream in terms of growth, with the total UK category now worth £13.2m, up 33.9 per cent in the last year, latest figures show.

The figures were revealed as weather experts said the warm weather is on its way back - with forecasters predicting a scorching start to September.

The cold, wet conditions of the last few weeks are to give way to a settled spell bringing back memories of the above-average temperatures of June and July.

That was replaced by cooler weather this month - but it is all set to change again next week.
