A woman who suffered a stroke at the age of just 29 has battled back to full health in just 13 months - to become a new wife, a new mother and head of her own business.

Jenny Hollowood-Smith, 29, fell ill at home just a week after a traumatic labour with son Corey.

During the attack she temporarily lost the vision in her right eye and doctors feared she might be severely disabled or die.

Powerful woman: Jenny Hollowood-Smith suffered a small stroke after giving birth to her son Corey but now thinks it was the best thing that has happened to her and has since set up her own bridal shop

But after her stroke Jenny who worked as a manager for BAE systems in Preston, Lancs used the attack to re-evaluate her life.

Soon afterwards in a quirk of fate she was offered voluntary redundancy from the military defence company and she grabbed the money to help set up herself as a wedding planner.

She then married Corey’s father Graham, 29, a sales manager, in a fairytale wedding to cap her 'crazy year'.

Jenny, from Leyland, Lancs whose bridal boutique shop is called Personal Touch Bridal said: 'I just realised how short life is and how you just have to make the most out of every single day.

'It’s been like a whirlwind since it happened and getting married was just the perfect way to put my wedding planning skills to the test before opening my own shop.

Family life: After giving birth to her son Corey she went on to leave her job with BAE Systems and follow her dreams of opening her bridal boutique

Achieved it all: Jenny not only gave birth, she also married Graham Smith and opened her own business venture

'The day was just everything I had ever dreamed of.

'At the time of the stroke it was terrifying as I lost vision in my right eye and had a tingling feeling down my arms and legs and I may have been left severely disabled or even worse not be around to see my son grow up.

'I was taken to hospital and then I went for an MRI scan which all came back positive and there were no signs of lasting damage.

'After this scare I took the approach that I needed to concentrate on making the most of things in life and have no regrets.

'So when BAE Systems offered voluntary redundancy I believed this was my opportunity to break out and do something I would love.

Her own: Personal Touch Bridal Boutique is Jenny's pride and joy

Her dream: Jenny says helping women plan their weddings is fantastic

'The redundancy money alone would not support my venture so I pulled together a business plan and went to the bank for support.

'Having been told that banks were not lending I decided to still go ahead and try to obtain funding and amazingly they said yes.

'I’d already helped to plan my brother’s before and then I got the perfect chance to really let loose on my own.

“I literally did everything, making my own favours and planning everything down to the last detail, I just loved it.

'It’s such a wonderful job to be able to help someone plan their special day or help them find the perfect dress, it’s a magical time and to be a part of that is incredible.'

Turning point: Jenny saw her stroke as the turning point in her life and within two months of making her own big day a success Jenny had secured her bank loan

Jenny had a traumatic labour, in August last year, where she suffered an infection after doctors failed to spot half of her water’s hadn’t broken.

But after being back at home for just a week Jenny decided she needed to get out of the house and was busy getting ready to go to a neighbours for dinner when she realised she couldn’t see half of her face in the mirror and had tingling sensations in her arms and legs.

Panicked Jenny was rushed to the hospital by husband Graham where after hours and numerous tests Jenny was devastated to be told she had suffered a mini-stroke, which could have easily killed her or left her severely disabled.

But Jenny saw her stroke as the turning point in her life and within two months of making her own big day a success Jenny had secured her bank loan, found the perfect location for a shop, spoken to up and coming wedding dress designers and launched her store.

Fantastic: Her pregnancy was fantastic with just a few days morning sickness

Jenny said: 'I was in a high pressured job, when I found out I was pregnant and I just thought what was I going to do. My pregnancy was fantastic, I had a couple of bad days where I was sick but it was fine.

'It’s every woman’s nightmare when something starts to go wrong during labour and it was just horrific. I thought I’d got through it all by the time I was back at home and then the stroke struck.

'At first I thought it was the light playing tricks on my eyes in the mirror but then I picked something up to read and half of it wasn’t there.

The girl with it all: Jenny has achieved all of her dreams since her mini stroke

'I knew something was wrong then and we rushed to the hospital, where they said they thought it was a mini-stroke. I was so scared I was sobbing my heart out and my mum was like you’ll be okay and Graham was petrified.

'The tests came back fine, there was no trace of anything my heart was fine, my brain was fine. It was really daunting getting my own shop but it was the best thing I ever did.

'To help brides with their big day is just unbelievable - it’s lovely to have a little part of that.'
