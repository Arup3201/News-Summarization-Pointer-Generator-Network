Eljero Elia joined Southampton on loan a few weeks ago looking for redemption and revival. So far all he has found is glory, scoring both his side’s goals here to help them move back to the giddy heights of third place — just a week after his debut ended with a first Saints win at Old Trafford for 27 years.

This victory was Southampton’s third away from home in a week, following that success at United then a midweek FA Cup win at Ipswich, as they continue to defy expectations.

It also meant a fourth straight match from four without a win in the temporary reign of Newcastle’s caretaker manager John Carver.

Home fans were dismayed not just by the result but that a late shout for a penalty was denied by referee Robert Madley after a shot from Emmanuel Riviere was stopped by Jose’s Fonte hand.

‘When you arms are by your side, maybe it’s not a penalty,’ said Carver. ‘When your arm is L-shaped and it hits your hand, it’s a penalty. They [Southampton] got the breaks at the right time.’

Elia is a 27-year-old Dutch winger who played, aged 23, for the Netherlands in the 2010 World Cup final but who did not continue to blossom. He is now on loan from Werder Bremen and looking to make a fresh start after periods of fitful form and off-field controversy.

A speeding offence in 2013 in Germany was the most serious of his ‘bad boy’ transgressions but he was also criticised for inflammatory tweets last year when he posted ‘ready for war’ in the build-up to a Werder versus Hamburg match.

He evidently feels a huge debt of gratitude to Southampton manager Ronald Koeman — to whom he dashed after scoring his first goal, tightly hugging his new boss before giving him an energetic thump on the arm.

Koeman said: ‘He needs to know his coach has confidence in him. And he needs to play in his best position like today. He was fast, strong, sharp.’

Asked if he could ‘tame’ Elia and help him finally flourish, Koeman said: ‘Yes, I hope. If he keeps his concentration on football. He’s doing well, he’s showing a lot of discipline.’

Koeman said he was especially pleased with today’s win given three away games in a row — and key absentees. ‘It was a long, difficult week,’ he said. ‘Three games away but if you win you gain confidence, spirit.

‘It was great to beat United but, as a manager, the win today is better because it’s the third [away] game and we were without key players.’

Koeman was forced into three changes from the starters who began at United having lost an influential trio to injury in Morgan Schneiderlin (abductor), Victor Wanyama and Toby Alderweireld (both hamstring).

They were respectively replaced by home-grown midfielder Harrison Reed, 19, midfielder Dusan Tadic returning to the starting line-up and summer signing Florin Gardos of Romania.

While the deputies ultimately helped to land another fine result, this was a fourth match in charge without a win for Carver, a Newcastle-born lifelong fan of the club, who turned 50 on Friday amid continuing uncertainly about who will be permanent manager. Maybe him. Maybe not.

He believes the club needs an end to the uncertainty around the post. ‘Absolutely,’ he said. ‘I hope it ends in the next two weeks.’ 

Newcastle soon brought themselves level on 29 minutes through Yoan Gouffran (far right)

Southampton have progressed from uncertainty over whether a transformed post-summer team would be competitive this season to the only question being how long they can sustain a remarkable run in the top four. Central to that is whether or not they have the strength in depth to keep it going. Certainly this result was a positive sign.

Newcastle had most of the possession and three chances inside the first 12 minutes. But Southampton took the lead when a long ball was cushioned down on the chest of Graziano Pelle to James Ward-Prowse, who played in Elia and he finished low across Tim Krul. The Newcastle goalkeeper could have done better but it was a quick fluid move and the hosts were caught off guard.

Newcastle were back level just before the half hour via a fluke. Gardos ran in to make a clearance from a through ball, when Forster might have taken it, but succeeded only in smacking the ball into the oncoming Gouffran, off whom it rebounded into the Saints net. It was Gouffran’s first goal since December 2013.

Newcastle were in the ascendancy in the second half until Koeman made a double substitution on the hour, taking off Ward-Prowse and Tadic and replacing them with Jack Cork and Shane Long.

Two minutes after that, Southampton were back in front. Long headed a ball from midfield which Elia chased down, before running between Fabricio Coloccini and Daryl Janmaat — who then unwittingly deflected in Elia’s shot.
