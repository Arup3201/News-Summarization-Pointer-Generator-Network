Princess Beatrice is set to follow in sister Eugenie's footsteps and has temporarily relocated to the US, the Duchess of York has revealed.

The 26-year-old princess, who is thought to have already arrived in the US, will study for a qualification in finance during her stay.

In a statement, a spokesman for the Duchess said: 'Princess Beatrice started a finance course in the US this week' but refused to confirm which institution the royal is studying at.

Following in her sister's footsteps: Princess Beatrice has relocated to the US to study finance

The news, which was first reported in Hello! magazine, means both of Prince Andrew's daughters are now living in the US, even if, for at least one of them, it isn't permanent.

Princess Eugenie has been based in New York since 2013 after taking a job with online auction house, Paddle8.

Beatrice, meanwhile, has remained in London since leaving university and has had a succession of jobs since, most notably an internship at Sony Pictures.

That, however, resulted in embarrassment for the princess after she was drawn into the Sony hacking scandal and had details of her salary splashed across the internet.

Other roles taken up since leaving university include a job at Cabot Square Capital, a company headquartered close to London's Marble Arch, and a series of patronages.

Although Beatrice receives no money from the Civil List and is entirely funded by herself and her parents, she has also undertaken engagements on behalf of the Queen.

Like Eugenie, she is also a regular sight at the big set-piece royal engagements, among them Trooping the Colour and Royal Ascot. 

The princess won't, however, be forced to rely only on her sister during her stay in the US. Although boyfriend Dave Clark is based in London, her mother is already in the US where she is visiting Eugenie.

A further chance to catch up with family arrives next month, when Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall arrive in the country for a four-day state visit. 

Staying behind: Dave Clark, who works in astronaut relations for Virgin Galactic, will remain behind

Visit: The Duchess of York, seen here at a charity fashion show last week, is currently visiting Eugenie

Family: Beatrice will have the opportunity to see her uncle Prince Charles when he visits the US next month
