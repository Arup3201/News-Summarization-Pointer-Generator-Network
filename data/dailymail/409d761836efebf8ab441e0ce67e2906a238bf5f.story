New cure: A probiotic drink derived from a Japanese pickle could help prevent flu, a study suggests

A probiotic drink made from a traditional Japanese pickle could help prevent flu, scientists have discovered.

New research has suggested that the immune-boosting powers of Lactobacillus bugs found in Japanese pickled turnip, or Suguki, could help fight the virus.

It is thought that the bacteria might even prevent more virulent strains of flu such as H1N1 and thedeadly H7N9 avian flu which recently emerged in China.

A probiotic drink which contains the KB290 strain of the bug is now being tested on humans having tested it on mice.

Fans of the vegetable have long claimed it has superfood properties but only now are scientists testing the pickle in the lab.

Naoko Waki, from the Japanese food company Kagome, which carried out a study into the bacteria, said: 'Our results show that when a particular 
strain of Lactobacillus brevis is eaten by mice, it has protective 
effects against influenza virus infection.'

The findings of the study have been published in the journal Letters in Applied Microbiology.

A protective layer of sugars called 
exopolysaccharides that protects the bacteria against acid stomach 
juices could lie behind its powers, the Japanese researchers believe.

Ms Waki said: 'We know that exopolysaccharides have 
immune boosting effects in other similar bacteria, so we wonder if the 
exopolysaccharides of KB290 are responsible for the effects we see.'

In the mouse study, the bacteria led the rodents' immune systems to create more flu-fighting antibodies.

Scientists hope that the research may 
lead to a new range of flu-fighting foods containing the bacteria to 
become available on the market.

Last month scientists predicted that a
 new 'Holy Grail' flu vaccine which gives lifelong protection against 
all strains of the virus could be available within five years.

Scientists
 from Britain and Europe were said to be getting ready to start large 
scale trials of a universal vaccine after early successful tests on 
humans.

The trial programme received a multi-million pound EU grant to fund research.

Strong stuff: The bacteria could even prove effective in combating more virulent strains of flu such as bird flu or swine flu
