Floyd Mayweather decided to dress up for Halloween in a far less conventional outfit as the undefeated boxer decided to wear a Run DMC costume.

While most celebrities were getting into the Halloween festive spirit by wearing scary masks and costumes, Mayweather decided to be different by mimicking the traditional outfits worn by members of the American hip hop group.

Mayweather attended what was described as the 'biggest Halloween party of the year' with two members of his management team.

The 37-year-old, who defeated Marcos Maidana at the MGM in September, was pictured watching Rick Ross perform at the Halloween party held in Las Vegas.

Meanwhile, Mayweather's long-term rival Manny Pacquiao has revealed he hopes to finally go toe-to-toe with the American boxer after years of speculation regarding a possible super fight.

The Filipino told AFP: 'Hopefully that fight [with Mayweather] will happen by next year.

'I'm crossing my fingers that that fight will happen but right now my mind is already set to focus on my next fight but Algieri. I think the time to talk about that issue is after the fight.'
