Cindy Crawford embodies the word supermodel - the mere mention of her name conjures up glossy catwalk images of the heyday of modelling in the late eighties and early nineties. 

But the 48-year-old claims that those golden years are over and says models can no longer become superstars because big brands and magazines are only interested in celebrities.

In a new interview with ES magazine, out tomorrow, Cindy discusses the death of the supermodel and places the blame at the door of reality stars, pop singers and Hollywood actresses, who regularly snap up the front covers of publications.

Cindy Crawford, 49,  was one of the first ever supermodels. But she has claimed in a new interview with ES magazine that they are now extinct because magazines and advertisers now prefer reality stars, pop singers and actresses

Cindy said: 'Models are not really getting covers now, and they're not getting the big cosmetics contracts and that's where the money is - it's actresses and singers and reality TV people.'

Cindy was one of the original supers, alongside women including Christy Turlington, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer, Helena Christensen and Linda Evangelista.

The women dominated fashion in the 80s and early 90s and were feted by design houses like Versace, Gucci and Chanel as well the glossy magazines like Vogue, Tatler and Elle. 

They were also giants in the advertising world, snapping up contracts with global brands like Revlon, Levi's and L'Oreal.

But since the late nineties, these domains have increasingly been taken over by celebrities from the world of acting, music and most recently, reality television. 

Cindy claims that appearing on magazine covers and in advertising campaigns was of little interest to actresses back in the day because they wanted to seen as serious artists. 

She said: 'The reason supermodels could come into being was because Hollywood actresses wanted to be taken seriously - they didn't want the red carpet to be a catwalk, which it has now become.'

She continued: 'And the models were like, "We'll do that!" And all of a sudden fashion wasn't just about Vogue and couture, there was an explosion of coverage and we were the rock stars of that.' 

Since those early days, the fashion world has managed to produce a couple of supermodels in the forms of Gisele Bundchen and Kate Moss. 

And more recently, Cara Delevingne has emerged head and shoulders above the rest of the new breed of models, bagging contracts with everyone from Topshop to Burberry.

But Cindy has claimed that they were simply one-offs and that there is unlikely to be a similar phenomenon to the early nineties modelling career again. 

Nowadays, take a quick glance at the magazine section in any newsagent and you will find scores of singers and reality stars  staring back at you.
