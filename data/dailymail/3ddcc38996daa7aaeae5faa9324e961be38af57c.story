Radio DJ Paul Gambaccini has claimed BBC bosses discriminated against him because he is gay.

The veteran broadcaster said his personnel file at the corporation was marked with a drawing of a Christmas tree to indicate he was ‘as camp as Christmas’.

He said managers feared he would be a ‘security risk’ because of his sexuality.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, the 64-year-old - who was a Radio 1 presenter for 13 years and now hosts Radio 4 music quiz Counterpoint - described himself as ‘one of the last of the Christmas trees’.

He said: ‘I am of the generation whose BBC personnel files had Christmas trees on them.

It meant you were ‘as camp as Christmas’ and thus a potential security risk.

‘The country was still obsessed with the Cambridge spies.

To some people, a gay man was a potential security threat and might betray his country to the Soviet Union. Utter balderdash!’

Mr Gambaccini, who co-wrote the musical The Ultimate Man, about a comic book superhero which was produced at the Bridewell Theatre in London in 2000, has been at the BBC for nearly 40 years.

Openly gay, he entered into a civil partnership with his boyfriend Christopher Sherwood last year.

Explaining he has never denied his sexuality, he said: ‘I was never in’.

Born in New York, Mr Gambaccini became a British citizen in 2005.

He began his career at the BBC in 1973 as a reporter on the Radio 1 John Peel show Rockspeak.

Last year, the DJ was criticised when he
revealed he knew about sexual abuse by former BBC DJ Jimmy Savile but 
failed to report him.

At
the time, he defended himself, saying: ‘So what, I a junior DJ am 
supposed to get up there and say my senior is a perv? They are going to 
laugh at me. It never occurred to me.’

He added: ‘Jimmy Savile had an imperial personality in showbusiness.

You just didn’t mess with Jim — you let him have his turf.’
