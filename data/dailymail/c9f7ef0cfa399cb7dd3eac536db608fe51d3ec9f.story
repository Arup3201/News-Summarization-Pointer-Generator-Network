David Cameron will plead with Iran for help in smashing Islamic State today as he prepares to order air strikes on the terror group.

In a major diplomatic gamble, the Prime Minister will hold talks with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani in New York to discuss co-operation over the escalating crisis in neighbouring Iraq.

The talks, due to take place at the United Nations today, are the first of their kind since anti-Western Islamic fundamentalists seized power in Tehran in the 1979 revolution.

The terror group has murdered three Western hostages in recent weeks and threatened to kill British taxi driver Alan Henning, who is currently being held.

MPs could be recalled to Parliament for an emergency session at the end of this week to approve RAF bombing raids.

Iran is a close ally of the Shia-led government in neighbouring Iraq and is already involved in fighting IS extremists on the ground in the north of the country. But Tehran’s support for other terror groups, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, has made it an international pariah

Until now, it has been excluded from diplomatic efforts to build an international alliance against IS.

British sources last night acknowledged that dealing with Iran will be fraught with difficulty, not least because of its support for Syrian tyrant Bashar al-Assad and its efforts to build a nuclear bomb.

But Britain views Mr Rouhani as a relative moderate and officials believe it will be worth the risk of trying to co-operate to defeat IS. 

Mr Rouhani’s election last year has led to a slight thawing in relations between London and Tehran, which have been frosty for the past 35 years.

Iran is seen as a key player in shoring up the new government in Baghdad, which is struggling to deal with the onslaught from the terror group. 

A senior Downing Street source last night said Mr Cameron would tell Mr Rouhani to drop his support for Assad, and warn him that developing nuclear weapons remains unacceptable. 

‘We are under no illusion about the dangers of Iran’s nuclear programme and our approach on that is not changing,’ the source said.

‘However, if Iran is willing to join the international community to defeat IS, then we will work with them on that.

‘But we will be clear that you cannot take one approach in Baghdad and another Damascus. You need a political solution in both if you are serious about defeating IS.’

Britain and Iran have had a fractious relationship since the overthrow in 1979 of the Shah by Islamic radicals led by Ayatollah Khomeini.

Britain suspended diplomatic relations after militants stormed the US embassy. The Iranians branded the US ‘The Great Satan’ and the UK ‘the Little Satan’. Ties were only resumed in 1988.

Further trouble was caused by Tehran declaring a fatwa against Salman Rushdie and then by suspicions that it was trying to build nuclear weapons. 

In one of the most humiliating episodes in the Royal Navy’s recent history 15 British sailors and Marines were seized in 2007 in another confrontation.

In 2011 Britain imposed sanctions to try to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions – a decision that led to the expulsion of the British ambassador and the storming of his embassy.

 However, relations have improved following the election of a moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, in 2013 and an agreement on how to deal with Iran’s nuclear ambitions. 

In June the embassy reopened.

Mr Cameron is expected to hold separate talks with a string of world leaders over the next 36 hours in New York, as part of the drive to build a global alliance to destroy the terror group.

These will include discussions with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi today on tackling the Islamist threat in his country.

In a keynote speech to the UN General Assembly tomorrow night, Mr Cameron will call on the world to unite to tackle the rise of Islamic extremism.

He is also expected to indicate that Britain is ready to join the US and France in carrying out air strikes against IS forces in Iraq, at the request of the government in Baghdad. But Number 10 is still weighing up the political, military and legal risks of extending any bombing campaign to attack IS bases in neighbouring Syria without the support of Assad.

Downing Street has all but ruled out deploying regular British combat troops to take on IS.

But Tony Blair yesterday warned that ground troops may be needed. In a 6,500-word essay setting out the case for war, the former prime minister called for a ‘willingness to take casualties’ and warned: ‘Airpower alone will not suffice.’
