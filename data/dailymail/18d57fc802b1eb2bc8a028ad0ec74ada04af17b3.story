Screaming children were among 31 people who had to be rescued yesterday when an amphibious tourist bus sank within minutes of entering a dock.

The terrified passengers were plunged into the water in Liverpool’s Albert Dock after the Yellow Duckmarine’s ‘splash down’ landing went wrong.

Coastguards arrived to rescue passengers from the freezing cold water just before 4pm as locals tried to help on nearby barges.

Shock: The Yellow Duckmarine boat sinking in Albert Dock with 31 people on board, as locals on barges tried to haul them out

Sinking fast: An eyewitness said the former World War Two landing vehicle took only four minutes to disappear beneath the water

Emergency services: Police and ambulances rushed to help with the rescue operation led by the fire service

Rescue mission: A Royal Navy air sea rescue helicopter attended the scene to look out for stranded passengers

Liverpool attraction: Questions over the future of the whole Duckmarine tour were raised after today's incident

The Royal Liverpool Hospital treated 
17 people following the incident - the youngest was just two-years-old 
and the eldest was in their sixties.

This
is the second time this year that the Yellow Duckmarine amphibious bus 
has sunk while driving from the dockside into the water.

Kayak instructor Liam Langley, 18, was teaching a group of teenagers when he was alerted to reports of distress on his radio.

He said: 'Our group paddled over to help but were told emergency services were on theway.

'The Duckmarine looked top heavy when it went in the water, like its buoyancy had gone and it just went down like a lead balloon.'

Another eyewitness Tim Olsen said: 'It only 
took about four minutes to go down. The police, ambulance and air 
ambulance services arrived on the scene quickly'.

Into the depths: Recovery trucks used specialist lifting gear to remove the sunken yellow boat

Back safe: The boat was salvaged this evening

Large crowds gathered around the scene in front of Salthouse Dock, a busy shopping area, as 19 ambulances and a Royal Navy air rescue helicopter arrived. 

A spokeswoman for the North West 
Ambulance Service said: 'Police are continuing to search the water just 
to see if there is anybody else affected and we are on stand-by.

Some of the passengers were treated for shock but no other major injuries have been reported.

Salvage crews have now managed to retrieve the vessel out of the water.

The future of the boats has been brought into question as another Yellow Duckmarine tour boat sank in March this year.

The climax of the tour is intended to be the moment when the boat moves from land to water but the company's permission to 
take the boats into the river was suspended while a safety 
investigation was carried out.

Successful operation: Everyone aboard was safely rescued but police are continuing to check the water as a precaution

Evacuation: Rescuers pulled people to safety after the 'splashdown' ending of the tour went wrong

Freezing cold water: 17 patients were treated at the Royal Liverpool Hospital after they were hauled out of the waters of the River Mersey

Investigation: Another Duckmarine boat sinking in March this year, which caused a temporary suspension for the 'splashdown' climax of the tour

Submerged: When the first boat sank but it raised safety questions for the tours

The Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson 
tweeted this afternoon: 'I will not make any official comment on future 
of these ducks until we know people are all ok.'

One angry Twitter user from Liverpool wrote: 'questions for regulators after 2nd sinking today e.g why probe into 1st sinking not revealed before tours restarted?'

Another wrote: 'Can't see Liverpool Duck tours surviving after another vehicle sank today, Obviously no longer safe.'

High-profile passengers: The Queen and Prince Philip took a ride on the Yellow Duckmarine tour for her Diamond Jubilee celebrations

Their four boats are adapted from World War Two landing vehicles. Between 700 and 1,000 are currently thought to still exist.

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have previously been passengers on the Yellow Duckmarine, when they toured Merseyside as part of the Diamond Jubilee tour last year.

Other high-profile passengers include Richard Branson and Sir Paul McCartney.

A spokesman for Yellow Duckmarine said: 'We are working closely with our regulatory body, The Maritime & Coastguard Agency and Merseyside Police.

'The craft involved in the incident holds a valid passenger carrying certificate.

'The craft has now been recovered and following consultation with MCA it has been taken to a place of safe and secure storage in order that a full investigation can take place. That will continue tomorrow morning.

'Our team followed their emergency response procedure, ensuring the safe disembarkation of passengers on board.

'We were aided in this regard by a number of canal boat owners berthed in Salthouse Dock to whom we would like to express our thanks.'
