Sportsmail tennis correspondent Mike Dickson believes that the blustery conditions at the Australian Open this week could favour Andy Murray in his semi-final match with Tomas Berdych.

The British No 1 eased past local favourite Nick Kyrgios to set up an encounter with the in-form No 7 seed who is yet to lose a set at the tournament.

The pair have met before in a grand slam semi-final with Murray defeating the Czech at the 2012 US Open - in extreme gale conditions - before going on to win the tournament.

Dickson believes that Murray's ability to adapt to challenging conditions will stand him in good stead, although he would not be surprised if the match went the distance in five sets.

A sub -plot to the encounter is that Murray will come up against his long time friend Dani Vallverdu who now coaches Berdych.
