BBC news chief James Harding hit back at critics who suggested the Corporation was to blame for a decline in local newspaper sales

The BBC’s news chief has denied claims the corporation is destroying local newspapers with its  publicly funded free websites.

In his first public speech since being put in charge of the BBC’s 5,000 journalists, James Harding hit back at critics such as Home Secretary Theresa May, saying they were ‘mistaken’.

In November, Tory MPs accused the BBC of undermining local democracy by competing with print titles and called for it to close some of its news websites.

But Mr Harding – who is the former editor of The Times – said online rivals such as Google and Facebook, rather than the BBC, were to blame for declining local newspaper sales.

Despite promising to ‘do anything to help’ struggling competitors, he insisted the BBC would not ‘rein in its local news coverage’.

Giving the WT Stead lecture at the British Library on Monday he said: ‘There is what I consider to be a mistaken view that the BBC should rein in its local news coverage for fear of aggravating the economic woes facing local newspapers.

'We have a direct interest in the health of local newspapers and regional newsrooms.

'We thrive thanks to vibrant public debate and courtesy of the stories and ideas unearthed by our colleagues in rival news organisations.

'But, let me be clear, the problems facing the local newspaper industry are not the BBC’s fault.’

In the past year, the BBC’s news output has been attacked by a series of senior politicians for biased reporting.

Conservative chairman Grant Shapps warned that the licence fee could be cut if the corporation’s output is not made more impartial.

In November, Mrs May said the BBC’s local websites were ‘dangerous for local politics’, adding: ‘It’s destroying local newspapers and could eventually happen to national newspapers as well…the BBC has to think carefully about its presence locally and the impact it has on local democracy.’

Home Secretary Theresa May said the BBC's local websites were 'dangerous for local politics' while Conservative chairman Grant Shapps warned the licence fee could be cut if the Corporation's output is not made more impartial

But Mr Harding hit back, saying: ‘I worry when politicians and judges weigh in, either frequently or eagerly, on the behaviour of journalists and news organisations.

‘At a time when our society needs curious, inquisitive journalism more than ever, I think we need to be extremely vigilant against encroachment on press freedom and freedom of expression.’

He added: ‘The local newspaper industry’s problems lie with the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Gumtree, Ebay and a long, long tail of others.

'I am acutely concerned by the pressures facing the local newspaper industry and we at the BBC will do anything to help.

‘But the BBC’s primary responsibility must be to serve licence fee payers – and they want and are entitled to the best possible local news services we can deliver.’
