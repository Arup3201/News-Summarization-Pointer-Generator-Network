As her father languishes in the water, this bewildered little cygnet knows only that she should not leave his side.

So she paddles determinedly in his wake as he drifts in the canal, a broken shadow of the majestic creature he once was.

Then as he curls up in some rushes, slipping in and out of consciousness, the cygnet snuggles on his back, seeking some comfort in the smooth white feathers.

The baby swan trails its father, who had to be put down after it is thought it was poisoned with contaminated bread

Elsewhere on the canal, her mother was already close to death, victim of a poisoner thought to have fed both swans contaminated bread. By the time rescuers found the pair it was too late to save them and both had to be put down. Last night their orphaned cygnet was being cared for at a wildlife rescue centre. The RSPCA is investigating the deaths.

The drama unfolded in the early evening on Sunday when passers-by noticed the distressed swans on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Church, Lancashire. The birds seemed to be semi-conscious, swooning and drooping in the water.

A dog walker alerted the RSPCA and officers arrived at the canal bank. The birds, which have royal protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, were rescued but it was too late to save them. It is feared that they had been fed poisoned food, with reports that contaminated bread was found nearby.

The deaths have been branded as ‘despicable’ and ‘beyond belief’ by community leaders.

It is feared that food they had been given may have been poisioned, with reports that contaminated bread was found nearby.

A spokeswoman for the RSPCA said: 'A concerned dog walker called to report two adult swans that looked very lethargic near a canal at Peel Bank, Church.

'With the help of the member of the public, the swans, along with their cygnet, were collected by an RSPCA Animal Welfare Officer and taken to a local vet.

‘Sadly the vet decided the two adult swans had no chance of survival. They were put to sleep, and their cygnet has been transferred to an RSPCA wildlife centre. Neither swan appeared to have any physical injury and one route the RSPCA is investigating is that the swans have been poisoned.

'We are extremely grateful to the walker who flagged this up to us.'

A dog walker said he came across the swans at around 5pm on Sunday.

He said: 'I was walking my dog and there was a group of people, and I wondered what they were up to.

'I saw one girl cuddling a swan on the bank, and the other swan was in the water with its young one.'

The man called the charity initially believing the birds had been physically attacked.

After taking his dog home, he returned with his camera and took pictures of the swans, which he posted on the internet asking for help to find the culprits.

He wrote: 'They were still just about living. Kids are looking after the swans the best they can for now.

'Sorry if this is a bit panicky but it’s a crying shame and darn right sick - whoever’s done it. I’m going back there now.'

Local councillor Peter Britcliffe, said: 'You really do wonder what sort of despicable person would do this to animals.

'It’s beyond belief and incredible that somebody could get up to something like this. I’m sure everybody will be stunned by this.'
