Those intent on forcing Arsene Wenger out of Arsenal will have to put their protests on ice.

His tenure has come under intense scrutiny from disgruntled fans over the past few days; the defeat at Stoke on Saturday raising major question marks.

Once more, though, he found answers - his side emphatically disposing of a poor Galatasaray side.

The match will forever be remembered for Aaron Ramsey's wonder goal.

Wenger may remember it for different reasons, however. When the chips were down, his players weren't.

In reality, there was very little at stake for Wenger's side, with their passage into the knockout stages already guaranteed.

Nevertheless, the manager will be glowing inside about how his side came through for him in Istanbul.

They had two ultra slim hopes of finishing above Borussia Dortmund at the top of Group D going into the encounter.

The first was beating Galatasaray and Anderlecht recording a shock win over Jurgen Klopp's men.

The other seemed beyond the realms of possibility; Arsenal winning 6-0 and then a draw in Germany would have been suffice.

Arsene Wenger played the percentages, leaving 12 first-teamers at home, though most other were injured, so not to risk any further problems going in to the busy festive period.

There were rare starts for Lukas Podolski and Joel Campbell, while Mathieu Debuchy made his first appearance in three months since recovering from an ankle injury.

The Frenchman's team selection raised a few eyebrows, though. Despite their minimal chances of finishing, another defeat would only serve to fuel the growing feeling amongst some fans that the manager must leave.

Any early apprehension faded inside three minutes, though, when Podolski smashed them into an early lead.

Ramsey, after an early season blip, is starting to reach last season's heady heights; and he provided further evidence of that as he strode through midfield before playing in Podolski down the left.

The German still had plenty to do, but the sheer ferocity in his left-foot effort saw the ball speed past home goalkeeper Sinan Bolat at his near post.

Podolski wheeled away like it was nothing. The quality of the finish begged a question, though. 

With that in the locker why is the World Cup-winner so far down Wenger's forward pecking order?

It's a question Podolski, who has openly admitted he could quit Arsenal in search of regular football, wants answering next month.

And Podolski once again stated his case for regular first-team football in the 11th minute as he played a key role in Arsenal's second.

Under pressure from the Germany international, Tarik Camdal lost possession in midfield; Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain picked up the pieces before sliding a ball through to Ramsey who calmly rolled the ball past Bolati.

It was the kind of unerring finish that became Ramsey's trademark last season. We've not seen so much of it this term, perhaps a key reason behind Arsenal's troubles.

The criticism levelled at the Wales midfielder is that he's been trying too hard to replicate the goalscoring exploits of last season; something that has been noted by Wenger.

It seems, however, Ramsey is finally finding his touch; what was to happen later was testament to that.

Podolski was in no mood to share the limelight, though, as he set about making a statement to his manager.

From a similar position to where he open the scoring, Podolski hit the crossbar in the 20th minute, before hitting the side from an identical location a few minutes later.

But Podolski could only applaud what happened next though as Ramsey had the home supporters clapping in admiration with a truly breathtaking strike. 

There seemed no danger when Joel Campbell's corner was half-cleared to Ramsey 35 yards out.

However, after a quick touch to control, he unleashed an unstoppable half-volley that flew past Bolat and into the top right-hand corner.

But for a small section of a few hundred travelling fans, the Turk Telecom Arena fell silent as they tried to comprehend exactly what had just happened.

And, finally, as the realisation dawned on them an echo of applause rippled around the stadium.

Suddenly the 6-0 scenario that had been dismissed before kick-off didn't seem so far fetched.

With their side unable to qualify for the knockout stages, the Turk Telekom Arena was largely empty  

Had Campbell and Calum Chambers converted excellent chances before the break then it would certainly have been on the agenda.

But Arsenal's momentum slowed when Wenger brought off Ramsey - due to a hamstring issue - and Mathieu Flamini in place of two youngsters: Gedion Zelalem and Ainsley Maitland-Niles at half-time.

Even that decision looked the right one as news of Borussia Dortmund taking the lead against Anderlecht filtered through.

The second half, compared to the first was a none event; Wesley Sneijder scoring a brilliant 88th minute consolation free-kick before Podolski added Arsenal's fourth with the final kick of the game.

By that time, though, Arsenal's minds were already on Monday's draw.
