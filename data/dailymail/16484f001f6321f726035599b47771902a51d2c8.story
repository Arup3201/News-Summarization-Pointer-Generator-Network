A Canadian woman who suffered a brain hemorrhage just after Christmas is being kept on life support until her baby boy is big enough to be born.

Robyn Benson, of Victoria, was 22 weeks pregnant when she collapsed at home after complaining of a piercing headache.

There was nothing doctors could do to save her, but they are trying to keep her body alive for seven more weeks in the hope that the baby she was carrying will survive.

In love: Dylan and Robyn Benson at their wedding last July. The couple had been high school sweethearts

For her husband, Dylan, the day the couple's longed-for baby boy is born will be filled with mixed emotions.

'On one hand, I can’t wait to meet my son and try, and give him the best life possible and try my hardest to be a great dad for him. On the other hand, I know that the day or the day after he is born will be the day that I have to say goodbye to Robyn,' Mr Benson told CBC.

Although Mrs Benson has been declared brain dead, doctors are trying to keep her body alive for another seven weeks, so the baby can be safely delivered by cesarean section.

'Pretty much her body is doing everything but her brain isn't there anymore,' he said, adding that he recently felt the baby kicking for the first time.

The couple, who had been high school sweethearts, married in July and were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of their first child.

When the baby is born, Mr Benson plans to call him Iver - a name the couple had chosen before Mrs Benson's sudden illness.

On the morning that she suffered the brain hemorrhage, Mrs Benson had woken with a piercing headache and asked her husband to go out and buy painkillers.

When he returned, Mrs Benson was slumped unconscious in the bathroom.

She was rushed to hospital but the following day, on December 29, she was declared brain dead.

Mr Benson, who works for an IT company, has had to take time off work to keep a vigil at his wife's bedside.

A You Caring fundraising site has been set up to help Mr Benson, who will be welcoming a baby into the world at the same time as burying his wife.

Initially, the family hoped to raise $36,000 - enough to cover Mrs Benson's annual salary - but in an outpouring of support for Mr Benson and baby Iver, more than C$115,000 ($103,000) has been raised.

In an update on Iver's progress, Mr Benson posted a message on the site saying how touched he was by the support.

He added: 'We had another ultrasound today and things are still looking good for Iver, and Robyn is still holding on strong.'

Money raised through the fund will be used to pay for baby supplies, daycare, housing and an education fund for Iver.

'It is very difficult to know that our son will grow up never meeting his wonderful mother, and that we will have to say our goodbyes to Robyn within hours of seeing Iver for the first time,' Mr Benson said.
