John Prescott has admitted the Iraq war may have been illegal and warned that Tony Blair’s call for regime change in Iran and Syria is ‘absolutely bloody crazy’.

As a series of Al Qaeda-linked car bombs and suicide blasts in Baghdad marked the tenth anniversary of the US-led invasion, the Labour peer, who served as deputy prime minister at the time of the war, said he now fears the invasion was legally wrong.

He told CNN International’s Amanpour programme that while ‘shock and awe may have got rid of Saddam ... it certainly never brought peace’.

Former Deputy Prime Minister John, now Lord, Prescott has raised questions about the legality of the Iraq War in an interview tonight

Lord Prescott said: ‘You have to ask yourself, ten years on, was it justified and was it really about regime change? And if it was about regime change, I’m afraid that doesn’t make it legal.’

His criticism is significant as he was one of Mr Blair’s most loyal Cabinet ministers. He said Mr Blair’s strategy for Iraq in 2003 had been shaped by his successful interventions in Sierra Leone and Kosovo.

But Lord Prescott said he was now alarmed at Mr Blair’s calls for regime change in Syria, and Iran, as it is taking steps to acquire nuclear weapons. ‘He wants to do it now in Iran, possibly, and Syria. Absolutely bloody crazy.’

Lord Prescott's comments came as former Prime Minister Tony Blair defended the decision to invade on March 19, 2003, with the U.S. by saying Iraq would have suffered a bloody revolution anyway.

During the invasion and its aftermath, 
179 British service men and women were killed. Estimates of the number 
of Iraqis to have died range from 110,000 to 600,000.

The decision was made following legal advice by former Attorney General Lord Goldsmith gave Tony Blair the 'green light' for war just days after visiting Washington.

Three days after this advice was given to the Cabinet - and 
without any debate on it by ministers, British and U.S. troops moved in.

It led to Britain's biggest ever political protest as more than one million protesters took to the streets of London to try to stop British participation in the war.

Asked whether he regretted the invasion, Lord Prescott told CNN's Amanpour programme: 'I think you have to start from the beginning to the end. It's 10 years - time to look at those decisions.

'Right at the beginning we were hoping to get the United Nations resolution.

'There were other matters we agreed to, not least of all the road map with Bush and the Israel-Palestine, all those things were not achieved and we can see now that in the shock and awe, we may have got rid of Saddam, but it certainly never brought peace.

'And you have to ask yourself 10 years 
on was it justified and was it really about regime change? And if it was
about regime change, I'm afraid that didn't make it legal.'

Asked if he had doubt in his mind at the
time that the invasion was about weapons of mass destruction, Lord 
Prescott said: 'I think the weapons of mass destruction, Tony certainly 
believed that.

'He [Saddam Hussain] had used gas 
against people. So this was a terrible man. But at the end of the day, 
you have to ask yourself was it legitimate to go in?'

Asked if he feels responsible, Lord 
Prescott told CNN: 'Of course I've got a share in the responsibility. It
was quite clear from the discussions that Tony and Bush were having 
that he was quite prepared to go into Iraq without the support if 
necessary.'

Today Tony Blair, the Prime Minister at the time, spoke out to justify his decision to invade by saying Saddam Hussain would have been overthrown anyway, and it would have been a 'lot worse than Syria'.

Mr
Blair told the BBC: 'I certainly think that if Saddam had still been in
power, its true there would have been, probably, an uprising among his 
people.

'But I think it would have been a lot more like Syria and probably a lot worse than Syria.'

Lord Prescott's comments go further than the previous doubts he has expressed over the Iraq War.

In 2009 he admitted in the New 
Statesman magazine that he wondered how he had agreed to go along with 
Britain's participation in the war.

A year later he gave evidence to the 
Chilcot Inquiry, when he revealed he had doubts about the intelligence 
on Saddam Hussein's weapons programmes before the invasion.

Earlier this week, Lord Prescott told the Sunday Mirror why he supported the war a decade ago.

He said: 'My support for action in Iraq was justified by certain conditions, as Tony agreed. The first was that any agreement to go to war had to be backed by UN resolutions.

'Secondly,
I wanted to make sure that it was not about regime change. Saddam 
needed to observe the previous 17 UN resolutions on his development of 
WMD.

'Thirdly, Bush had to give an agreement to implement a road map for a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinian ­territories. And finally, our own Parliament had to back military action.'

Lord Prescott admitted that when his government only achieved approval Mr Blair continued because he believed the war was 'justifiable'.

In the U.S., former Vice President Dick Cheney says he
has no regrets about the War in Iraq and would do it again 'in a 
minute' in a new documentary which airs tonight.

In the film entitled The World 
According to Dick Cheney, Cheney says he 'feels good about' the U.S. led
action which has cost the lives of  4,488  U.S. armed service members and 134,000 Iraqi civilians.

He
also defends the use of torture in the wake of 9/11 including the 
controversial technique of simulated drowning or water-boarding in the Showtime film.
