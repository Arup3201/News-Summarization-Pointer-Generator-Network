Spain's Rafael Cabrera-Bello managed something even Rory McIlroy was unable to do as he surged into contention for the season-ending DP World Tour Championship on Friday.

McIlroy birdied four of the first five holes on the Earth Course at Jumeirah Golf Estates on his way to an opening 66 which gave him a share of the lead with Shane Lowry on six under par.

The world No 1's only aberration in that brilliant return to action after a six-week lay-off was missing from six feet for birdie on the third, but Cabrera-Bello showed him how it was done on Friday.

The 30-year-old had managed just two birdies in his opening 73 to lie seven shots off the pace, but picked up shots at each of the first five holes of his second round to improve to four under par.

That took him to within two of the lead and into a share of fifth place, with McIlroy and Lowry still more than two hours away from beginning their rounds.

Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell was also moving in the right direction in ideal conditions, the Ryder Cup star collecting birdies at the first and second to move to two under.
