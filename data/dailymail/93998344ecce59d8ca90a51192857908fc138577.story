A toddler has defied the odds by recovering from an incredibly rare condition that left her body covered in bruises.

Hannah Hutchinson was just four weeks old when she was diagnosed with a rare condition that affects just one in 100,000 children.

She has Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, which leaves her suffering from tumours that dramatically deplete her blood platelet levels.

It means her blood cannot clot so a simple cut or bruise could be life-threatening.

The 19-month-old has to go to hospital every day and takes as many as ten different medications to control her condition.

But specialists from Alder Hey Hospital, in Liverpool, believe they may have successfully treated the condition, and hope she can make a full recovery.

Her mother, Vicki Hutchinson, first suspected something was wrong when Hannah was just one month old and she developed severe bruising on her stomach.

She was rushed to A&E where doctors carried out a blood test and found that Hannah’s platelet count had dropped to a dangerously low level.

Mother-of-four Mrs Hutchinson, 35, from Liverpool, said: ‘Hannah was born healthy and had a normal delivery - but when she was four weeks old I spotted a huge bruise on her belly while I was changing her nappy.

Hannah had a tumour which depleted her platelet levels meaning her blood couldn't clot and she was at risk of a life-threatening bleed. She was diagnosed after developing a bruise on her stomach at one month old

Hannah (pictured in hospital) had to have surgery to remove the tumour but after the operation she started to bleed uncontrollably and ended up fighting for her life

‘When you see something like that on your baby you think either someone has hurt her or that it is meningitis - so we rushed her straight to hospital.

‘The doctor’s thought that we had hurt Hannah at first, they didn’t know what was wrong with her. It wasn’t until they did a blood test that they noticed her platelets were very low.

Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is a rare benign tumour of the blood vessels.

It is not cancerous and does not spread around the body.

It is often accompanied by a potentially serious condition called Kasabach-Merritt syndrome.

This occurs when the tumour traps and destroys platelets in the child's body.

This means the child's platelet levels are depleted so their blood cannot clot properly.

As a result, they are at risk of dangerous bleeding.

‘If I hadn’t got her straight to hospital, or had ignored the bruising, she could have died that day.’

Hannah had an operation to remove a large tumour from her torso when she was four months old, but had to be rushed into hospital again after the wound began to bleed uncontrollably.

Her parents, Vicki and her husband James, spent their first wedding anniversary at their daughter’s bedside as she fought for her life in hospital.

Mrs Hutchinson said: ‘She was bleeding really heavily from the wound so we rushed her straight to hospital.

‘They gave her a blood transfusion and pumped platelets into her before she was hurried into the operating theatre.

‘We really thought we were going to lose her that day, but she has really been a little fighter.’

The condition, which only affects children, means that Hannah’s platelet levels drop from a normal level of between 150 to 400 to as low as 12.

The toddler has already undergone countless operations and spent a lot of time in hospital, and is still required to visit the hospital for monitoring.

Hannah (pictured with her parents, Vicki and James, and her siblings Bethany, Sian and Andrew) is now starting to recover and her doctors hope she will grow out of the condition as she gets older

Hannah has to take up to ten medicines a day (pictured) as well as going to hospital for regular check ups

But her parents are hopeful that she will continue to show signs of recovery, and eventually recover fully from the condition.

Alder Hey Hospital’s consultant paediatric oncologist Professor Barry Pizer said: ‘It is a very rare condition that I believe affects only one in 100,000 people.

‘Sufferers get these vast vascular anomalies that affect their platelets in blood vessels and can lead to bleeding disorders, which are often life-threatening.

Hannah's mother, Vicki, said: 'When Hannah was first diagnosed we felt so alone. All we wanted was to find another mum or dad to speak to, someone who understood how we felt'

‘We currently do not know what causes the bleeding, but it can be fatal. We have tried a number of treatments with Hannah and we believe her last - a neurotherapy known as sirolimus - has been successful and she will begin to develop at a normal rate for a child her age.

‘The syndrome can cause severe problems for people depending where it is located in the body - in this case it is in Hannah’s chest and abdominal area. We hope the condition will burn itself out and will provide support to prevent the condition deteriorating.

‘I know the impact has been huge on Hannah’s family, but we are working to help her make a full recovery.’

Mr and Mrs Hutchinson are currently raising money for cancer charity CLIC Sargent and want to raise awareness of the rare condition to help other families in a similar position.

They said: ‘When Hannah was first diagnosed we felt so alone. All we wanted was to find another mum or dad to speak to, someone who understood how we felt.

‘The only people we had to speak to were doctors and nurses and we went through a really lonely time.

‘We had a lot of support from our friends and family - but CLIC Sargent were brilliant and really helped us through a tough time.

‘That’s why we think it is so important to raise money for them and to raise awareness of the condition.’
