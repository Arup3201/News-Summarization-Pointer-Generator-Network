Elizabeth Rose, 25, who has lost an appeal to have her eggs frozen despite facing chemotherapy treatment

An artist suffering from Crohn’s disease has lost an appeal to have her eggs frozen on the NHS before she undergoes ­chemotherapy treatment.

Elizabeth Rose, 25, fears that an ­‘imminent’ bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy to treat a severe form of the disease will cause early menopause and render her infertile.

Clinicians at King’s College Hospital, in south east London, applied on her behalf for funding so her eggs could be frozen.

But when Thanet Clinical Commissioning Group refused to pay for the £4,000 treatment, Miss Rose took it to the High Court, claiming that its ­decision was ‘unlawful’.

Miss Rose, of Margate, Kent, said she was a victim of a ‘postcode lottery’ because the treatment is available to other single women elsewhere in the UK.

She accused Thanet CCG of breaking the law by not implementing NICE guidelines, introduced early last year, that egg freezing should be funded on the NHS where medical treatment could affect fertility.

Mr Justice Jay dismissed her appeal, claiming Miss Rose ‘has failed to demonstrate any public law unlawfulness’.

He said that NICE could not demand ‘an immediate change of policy’ when it brought in new clinical guidelines.

However, he said Thanet CCG’s new policy, introduced this month, was in breach of the guidelines because it continued to refuse funding for freezing eggs.

Miss Rose’s lawyer Merry Varney said an 
urgent application would be made to Thanet CCG to reconsider her case 
‘within a matter of days’.

Miss Rose holds a degree in fine art from London’s Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. Since 2012, she has been too ill to work and receives disability ­allowance.

She said she cannot afford to fund the egg freezing herself.

Thanet CCG said it would consider the full written judgement carefully, working closely with NHS England. ‘If necessary we will review our policy on the freezing of eggs,’ said a spokesman.
