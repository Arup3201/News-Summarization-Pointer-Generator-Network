Council leader John Burden is among the delegation going on a publicly-funded 'fact-finding' mission to US theme parks

A council has been slammed over plans to send nine of its bosses on a £15,500 'fact-finding' trip to a string of Florida theme parks - at taxpayers’ expense.

The team from Gravesham District Council in Kent will visit Disney World, Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure in Orlando over four days at Easter.

The trip is being organised by 
developers London Resort Company Holdings (LRCH) as the council prepares
 for the arrival of the £2billion Paramount theme park in Swanscombe, Kent in 2018.

The officials going on the trip 
include council leader John Burden, planning boss Cllr Jane Cribbon and 
communities boss Cllr Andrea Webb.

Tory
 opposition Cllr John Cubitt and shadow planning boss Cllr Robin 
Theobald are also packing their bags, along with four senior council 
officers.

Organisers
 said the delegation will benefit from seeing similar-scaled projects 
and hearing about the development and running of a 'global attraction'.

But
 critics question why the group cannot get the same benefits from 
visiting a theme park closer to hand - such as Disneyland Paris.

Cllr
 Jeremy Kite, leader of neighbouring Dartford District Council, said: 'I
 must say, I think it’s an unusual thing for them to be doing. I can’t 
see the benefit with it at this time.

'I haven’t been invited and I wouldn’t go if we had been. If you’re going to do this sort of research, I think there’s places closer to home.

'You’ve got Euro Disney across the Channel and other places in Europe which are easier to get to. It seems like an interesting use of taxpayers’ money and not one I’m going to follow.'

But Cllr Burden, who is going on the trip, said: 'The programme for this visit is extremely busy being packed with serious business discussions which should provide invaluable insights into the issues surrounding the development of a truly global attraction on our doorstep.

The visit comes ahead of the planned £2billion Paramount theme park on the Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent

Critics say the council could have saved the taxpayer thousands by visiting Disneyland Paris

'It is entirely right the council examines all these issues fully and we are grateful to LRCH for facilitating these meetings with key people and communities which have had direct experience of facing and overcoming those challenges.

'This is the biggest development project in Europe and has global significance. The impact it will have is life-changing for everyone in the area and possibly far beyond.

'We have to get this right and prepare to be in a position to inform the discussions yet to come.'

It is hoped LRCH will reimburse the authority the cost of the trip during the planning process.

A council spokeswoman said: 'The council expects the cost of the visit (£15,441 approximately) will be met from the costs to process the planning application with this trip enabling the team to focus on the project specific questions that will need to be resolved by the applicant in due course for a scheme that is outside the normal planning parameters for any council.'

The new £2billion Paramount theme park is being planned as a rival to Disneyland Paris.

It will create up to 27,000 jobs and transform an 872-acre brownfield site in the Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent.

Developers plan to build a huge £2billion Hollywood-inspired resort in Kent.

Film giant Paramount Pictures has given permission for its name to be used for the proposed development on the Swanscombe Peninsula.

Developers hope the project – which would be built on the site of a former cement works near Dartford - will open in 2018.

It would be located near Ebbsfleet International station, which is on the Eurostar route between London and Paris.

The 872-acre site - nearly twice the size of the Olympic Park in Stratford - will feature Europe’s largest indoor water park, rollercoasters, cinemas, theatres, hotels and live music venues.

The site's developer, London Resort Company Holdings, estimates that the project would create up to 27,000 jobs in the area.

Announcing the plans in 2012, project leader Tony Sefton said: ‘Our vision is to create a world class entertainment destination, the first of its kind in the UK.'

Paramount Pictures films include the Madagascar franchise (pictured). A similar entertainment resort is due to open Spain in 2012, which will feature a Titanic Experience and rides based on Mission Impossible, Star Trek and War of the Worlds.
