Gough Whitlam once famously said of John Faulkner that he was 'the best Prime Minister Australia never had' but after 25 years serving Labor in the Upper House the senator will officially retire next month.

He has also made clear his intention to never reveal, in a conversation or a book, the intimate details of his meetings with Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd during the 2010 leadership battle that ultimately crippled the Labor government.

'It's true that I joined them then and I spoke to them both individually and of course when we met together one of the things that occurred is I gave a commitment to them I would not breach the confidence of that meeting,' Senator Faulkner said.

Senator John Faulkner has announced his intention to leave politics next month after 25 years in the Upper House

The Senator said his discussions with Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd during their bitter 2010 leadership battle will remain secret

Senator Faulkner said he will remain loyal to both Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard insisting 'I gave a commitment to them I would not breach the confidence of that meeting'

Former Labor PM, the late Gough Whitlam, once famously told ALP colleagues that Senator John Faulkner was 'the best Prime Minister Australia never had'

'I hope over my very long parliamentary career that I at least have the reputation of not breaching confidences and I don't intend to start now when announcing my retirement, I gave my word and intend to keep it.'

With this decision goes the last minister to have served in the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. Senator Faulkner, a former Defence Minister, will bow out after Australia Day.

'I have been extremely lucky to have such a long and fulfilling career in parliament. It's over and it's time to go,' he stated.

'I owe the Labor Party everything but it's a good time for the Labor Party for a new generation to step up.'

The outgoing Senator insisted he will remain an active member at branch meetings and supporting candidates in 'local, state and federal elections'.

His position is expected to be filled by Jenny McAllister, who was pre-selected in July to run in his place on the NSW Labor Senate ticket for the 2016 election.

Senator Faulkner vowed not to write an autobiography in his retirement as 'there are enough of those sort of books out there'.

'I remain an absolute Labor loyalist.

'I don't have any plans at the moment, I don't have any job offers, I won't be a lobbyist, I won't be a consultant, I won't be a regular media commentator.'

The outgoing Senator recalled how he first began working as a fully fledged Labor official in 1980 and was first elected for New South Wales in 1989. He was a minister in three Labor governments and Senate opposition leader for eight years.

Senator Faulkner vowed not to write an autobiography in his retirement as 'there are enough of those sort of books out there'.

The 60-year-old started out as a teacher and party official before entering politics.

His likely replacement, Ms McAllister, has been ALP national president since 2011.

She has worked for infrastructure advisory firm AECOM and has previously worked as a public servant and adviser to Labor politicians.

And for a politician who won respect from both sides, he remained loyal to the end insisting that he would not reveal the details of the discussions he had during the bitter leadership battles, which beset the Labor Party when it was last in government. 

However, Senator Faulkner said the ALP should be confident of its chances going forward. 'It has effectively rebuilt its fortune since the last election, it's working hard'.

He recalled with fondness his involvement in major national issues including Mabo, Telstra's privatisation, the GST and public service reform.

'Public service may be a favourite whipping boy for some, but in my experience, the men and women of the public service, from top to bottom are committed to the public and the national interest in everything they do,' he added.
