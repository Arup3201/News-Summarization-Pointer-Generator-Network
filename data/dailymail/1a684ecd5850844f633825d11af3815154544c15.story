If the Advertising Standards Bureau's list of most complained about ads in 2014 is anything to go by, it appears the Australian public are not fans of adultery, toilet humour or blasphemy.

A record number of ads were complained about in 2014, with the 'ick-factor' causing 5600 viewers to protest against their least favourite ad, the most amount of complaints since the ASB was established in 1998.

The most complained about ad of the year by far was the brainchild of online dating site Ashley Madison, which features married men singing 'I'm looking for someone other than my wife'.

The ad features a parody of the 1976 song 'Couldn't Get it Right' by the Climax Blues Band and is aimed at married people looking to have an affair.

481 people lodged complaints with the Bureau, although it was found that the ad didn't breach any codes of misconduct. 

My PlatesTV has three ads in the top ten, all of which features nose-picking and farting. In total the advertiser received 636 complaints about all three ads, but again the complaints were dismissed.

'While people may not wish to see 'ick-factor' images of nose-picking or farting on TV, or about dating sites for married people, the content of these advertisements do not breach the Codes, ASB, Chief Executive Officer, Ms Fiona Jolly said.

'When the Board considers an advertisement, they can only consider the content of the advertisement, not the product being advertised, and can only consider the specific sections of the Code of Ethics,'

TV viewers were not impressed with Menulog's depiction of Jesus and his disciples trying to decide whether to have Indian or pizza for dinner.

The ad received 228 complaints from people who thought it was blasphemous to make a mockery of such a significant event in history. 

Johnson and Johnson appear twice on the must-talked about list, for their detailed portrayals of embarrassing menstrual  experiences. 

The ads focus on women stuck in mortifying situations during their period and viewers found the scenes demeaning and degrading to women. 

My PlatesTV has three ads in the top ten, all of which features nose-picking and farting. In total the advertiser received 636 complaints about all three ads, but again the complaints were dismissed

Between both ads, they racked up and impressive 331 complaints from the public. The complaints were again dismissed and the ad was free to appear on air.

Ultra Tune were also criticised for portraying women in a negative light and objectifying them.

In the ad, two women dressed in leather and carrying whips appear in the mechanics office.

The slogan 'The word is out, we're into rubber' appears across the screen as the two women stroke rubber wheels.

The ad received 181 complaints from the Australian public, disgusted at the auto centres effort.

A billboard, commissioned by HorseRacingKills.com, showing a dead horse lying on it's side came in at eighth place on the list with 152 complaints.

The disturbing image came out just hours after Melbourne Cup favourite Admire Rakti died after finishing last in the race. 

The billboard read: 'Is the party really worth it? HorseRacingKills.com.' 

Complainers took issue with how graphic the image was and how insensitive it was in the wake of the horsing tragedy.

Sam Kekovich came under fire for his collaboration with Meat and Livestock Australia, encouraging Australians to eat lamb on Australia Day. 

The ad which received 80 complaints, was accused of being homophobic after it showed a lesbian dressed like a man and unethical by handing a lamb chop to a little boy wearing a 'vegan and proud' singlet.

'We received complaints about 552 ads in 2014, an increase from last year but still less than the 595 ads in 2009,' Ms Jolly said.
