Some friendships are just a bit more special than others. There is no doubt that the love between the late Sheila Marsh and her 25-year-old mare Bronwen was tender, warm and utterly reciprocated.

They had been inseparable for a quarter of a century.

Sheila, 77, had raised Bronwen from a foal to adulthood. She had schooled her, groomed her, fed her, taught her to jump and petted, cuddled, nuzzled and mothered her.

Final Goodbye: Sheila Marsh was reunited with her beloved horse, Bronwen, in the car park of Wigan Royal Infirmary hours before she lost her fight against cancer

Bronwen, in turn, was loving, kind, trustworthy and loyal.

Which is why, when Sheila lay in hospital last week, beaten by cancer, she had three dying wishes.

‘She wanted to see her favourite horse Bronwen one last time,’ says her daughter Tina, 33.

‘She loved that horse with everything she had. Her other wishes were to see her dog Poddy, whom she had owned for 13 years.

‘And to see me and my father speaking again, because we hadn’t spoken for years.’

And so, as revealed in Saturday’s Daily Mail, the brilliant staff at Wigan Infirmary welcomed Poddy on to the foot of Sheila’s bed and set up a poignant equine farewell – arranging for Bronwen to be transported from Sheila’s farm in Bickershaw, Greater Manchester, and then wheeling her bed out into the crisp November air for a last goodbye. No one who witnessed the moment remained dry-eyed. Sheila, who could barely speak, whispered Bronwen’s name and asked for a kiss.

Bronwen gently nuzzled her mistress on the cheek with a soft velvety nose.

Sheila died hours later, early on Tuesday morning. Although terribly sad, it was also a wonderfully uplifting moment in a world often hobbled by ridiculous health and safety regulations and endless bureaucratic nonsenses.

The photograph of their final moments was circulated on Twitter and Facebook and immediately went viral. Today, with Tina’s blessing, we bring you another picture of Sheila and Bronwen in happier times taking part in a show-jumping competition, and Tina and the glossy brown mare, pictured at the weekend, grieving but happy that Sheila is at peace.

Sheila had always been an animal lover and owned six horses, three dogs and three cats at her death.

‘We always had animals around the house growing up. Mum loved animals and she even had her own riding school until she got married,’ says Tina.

‘She was so animal orientated, she loved them all, but horses were her pride and joy.’

The 77-year-old's dying wish was to see her horse of 25-years one final time before she lost her cancer battle

Tina Marsh, 33, said that taking Bronwen to see her mother was very important and it was a 'beautiful moment'

Horses were Sheila’s life. She worked at Haydock Park Racecourse from the age of 21, first as race starter, then programme seller and later cleaning the parade ring. She had an exceptional eye for a champion, although she never gambled. According to all who knew her, she was kind, loving, hard-working, honest and caring. And terribly grateful to the staff of Wigan Infirmary.

‘Seeing Bronwen and Poddy was very important for my mum,’ says Tina.

But even better, her third wish – that Tina and her father, Sheila’s ex-husband, would finally bury the hatchet – came true, too. On Monday, the day before mum passed away, we put our differences aside and spoke for the first time in years.

‘So all her dying wishes were granted,’ says Tina.

‘I was there when she died and I know she died happy.’

And what of beautiful, gentle Bronwen? ‘She will stay with me now,’ says Tina.

‘Bronwen’s still part of our family and having her will be like having a connection to mum.’
