Manny Pacquiao made his feelings clear what his New Year's wish was on the eve of 2015, as he again called out rival Floyd Mayweather.

The 36-year-old PacMan has made no secret of his desire to fight fellow welterweight champion Mayweather, with the bout now looking increasingly likely to happen.

As 2014 came to a close on Wednesday Pacquiao tweeted: 'The ball will drop at midnight to usher in 2015. @floydmayweather let's not drop the ball on fighting each other next year!' #LetsMakeFistory

Pacquiao has previously tweeted to Mayweather that fans have waited long enough for a fight between them

Just a fortnight before that he had tweeted at Mayweather: 'Don't be a boxing humbug. Let's give the fans the fight they want. They have waited long enough.'

The fight between the pair was first discussed in 2009 but ultimately failed to materialise.

However, Pacquiao has now made it perfectly clear he wants a bout with Mayweather, with both in the twilight of their careers.

The target date for the bout is May, and if the Filipino was to win a potential first fight, there could be appetite for a re-match in September.

Pacquiao was superb in his last fight in November comfortably beating American Chris Algieri in Macau, while Mayweather saw off Marcos Maidan by an unanimous decision in Las Vegas in September.
