An alleged shark that appeared in a Manhattan Beach, California, wave on Friday as two children played in the water nearby was a dolphin, according to experts.

A
 local mother was taking a picture of 
her 12-year-old son and a friend just as they were about to catch a wave
 when the sea creature appeared in the break.

The ‘photobomb’ story went viral on Sunday and Monday, as people argued over whether it was a shark or a dolphin.

NOT a shark: A Manhattan Beach mother captured this image of what was initially thought to be a shark in the break of a wave next to her son and a friend in the water at Manhattan Beach, California

The verdict has now been delivered with an overwhelming majority of scientists concluding that the sighting was in fact of a bottlenose dolphin.

Experts say the tail fin is horizontal, like that of a dolphin and there is no sign of a second dorsal fin, which sharks have and dolphins do not.

Bottlenose dolphins are also frequently seen surfing in the faces of waves, while sharks are not, according to Grind TV.

Kera Mathes, a naturalist with the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, posted on her Facebook page that the sea creature was definitely a dolphin.

Big difference: Sharks have a second dorsal fin, seen here in this image, which dolphins do not

‘I hate that the poor sharks are getting a bad, scary rep for this when it’s a coastal bottlenose dolphin,’ she wrote.

Diane
 Alps of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Cetacean Society said 
in another Facebook comment: ‘Sure looks to be a bottlenose dolphin! 
Single falcate dorsal fin, horizontal flukes. General body shape looks 
dolphin-esque too.’

Florida-based shark connoisseur, David Shiffman, says the creature is obviously a dolphin, based on its flat tail fin.

‘I asked about a dozen shark scientists and a handful of dolphin scientists [sic] to confirm my suspicion that it was a dolphin, and 100 per cent of them identified it as a dolphin.

'It doesn’t have a second dorsal fin and the tail is flat. Dolphin.’

Rant: David Shiffman, a shark enthusiast, took to Facebook to deliver his thoughts on the issue of the 'shark' photo-bomb

It is not the first time a dolphin has been mistaken for a shark.

Professional
 surfer, Kolohe Andino, was photographed riding a wave which contained a
 creature that at first was thought to be a shark at the Hurley Pro surf
 contest at Lower Trestles near San Clemente, California, in September 
2012.

It was later identified as a bottlenose dolphin based on the shape of its dolphin-like fluke.

And
 in 2011 in north San Diego County, surfers were sure that a large 
critter photographed in a wave was a large great white shark.

But that, too, was most likely a dolphin turned sideways as it swam through the wave.

Jaws? Surfers have often been photographed riding waves containing what looks to be a shark

However, there are still some who 
believe it is a shark, such as Eric Martin, co-director of the 
Roundhouse Marine Studies Marine Lab and Aquarium.

And Salvador Jorgensen, a great white shark expert from Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station, told Grind TV that the tail in the picture from the recent shark scare ‘doesn’t really look like a shark tail more than, say, a dolphin sideways in the wave’.

But he added that it was ‘impossible to say for sure from the picture alone’.

Christopher Lowe, a white shark expert who runs the Shark Lab at Cal State Long Beach, said the tail looked more like that of a dolphin.
