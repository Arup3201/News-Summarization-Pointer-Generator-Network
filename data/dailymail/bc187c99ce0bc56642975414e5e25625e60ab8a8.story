It is a tourist explosion of a different kind. Scotland has taken more than half the places in a top travel guide's list of nine must-see extinct volcanoes in the UK.

Wanderlust said that although the country does not have any active volcanoes, the landscapes they have sculpted are 'a sight to behold.'

Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh and Ardnamurchan on the west coast were placed second and third, respectively, behind the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, which claimed top spot.

Arthur's Seat is a long extinct volcano thought to have first erupted 350 million years ago and is the highest point in Edinburgh

The north-western corner of Ardnamurchan contains an underground volcanic complex that is 55 million years old

Castle Rock in Edinburgh is around 340 million years old, providing the land with a natural defence

Most walkers take the Devil's Staircase across the hill to Kinlochleven when exploring Glen Coe in Scotland

9. Cuillin, Isle of Skye 

Of Arthur's Seat, Wanderlust said: 'A long extinct volcano thought to have first erupted 350 million years ago, it offers the best panoramic view over the city.'

The north-western corner of Ardnamurchan, meanwhile, contains an underground volcanic complex that is 55 million years old. One of its only access points is a single track road - perfect for cyclists and walkers seeking some solace, according to the travel guide.

'There are hundreds of local, historical and guided walks around the region. The geo-trail along the peninsula is the best, where you can see the rocky cliffs formed by the area's first volcanic eruption. 

'Mingary Castle sits atop two sheets of cooled, harden molten rock, while the abandoned village of Glendrian is situated within the volcanic amphitheatre, or 'ring-dykes'. The coast is also a home to many rare species such as wildcats, pine martens and golden and white-tailed eagles.'

Castle Rock, Edinburgh, placed fifth.

The guide said: 'Unlike the other volcanoes on this list, Castle Rock just happens to have a castle built on top of it (hence the name). The rock is around 340 million years old, providing the land with a natural defence and the castle itself defended by cliffs up to 80m high. 

'The rock and its castle are another great attraction for a visit to Edinburgh. The castle is situated in the old town section of the city, surrounded by well-preserved Reformation-era architecture,' said Wanderlust.

The beautiful and yet challenging Black Cuillin on the Isles of Skye will test even the experienced of climbers

Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland topped the list of nine volcanoes to see in the UK

Snowdonia predictably made the list, claiming fourth spot

Glen Coe made it in seventh place.

'What remains of this ancient super-volcano can be experienced by skiing, climbing, snowboarding, sledging, hiking and mountain biking, depending on the time of year you choose to visit. It's a landscape sculpted by volcanic eruption and glaciation,' said the guide.

'Most walkers take the Devil's Staircase across the hill to Kinlochleven, while the best routes for hillwalkers can be found in the mountain range of the Bidean nam Bian. Buachaille Etive Beag and Buachaille Etive Mor are also good sites, the latter of which is one of the areas' best spots for climbing. 

The Cheviot Hills in Northumberland were formed by volcanic lava flows, smoothed over by ice sheets moving across the region

The Borrowdale Volcanic Group in the Lake District secured sixth spot in the top nine volcanoes in the UK

The Aonach Eagach scramble also features two of Scotland's trickiest Munro hills: Sgorr nam Fiannaidh and Meall Dearg.'

Making the list in ninth were the Cuillins on the Isle of Skye.

'The Black Cuillin, formed from volcanic rock, are individually great for scramblers, climbers and mountaineers. They are beautiful, but they are challenging. A full traverse of the ridge, despite only being seven miles long, is likely to take you 15-20 hours. It's not for the inexperienced, as the routes are very long and often very exposed. Hire a guide,' said Wanderlust.
