Managers Bob Peeters and Uwe Rosler were involved in a bust-up following the final whistle of Charlton's 2-1 Sky Bet Championship victory over Wigan Athletic at the Valley.

Franck Moussa's 93rd minute deflected winner sparked an ugly row on the touchline after Peeters celebrated wildly in front of Latics counterpart Rosler.

Peeters apologised to his players for his part in the celebration, but the Belgian insisted he would not say sorry to Rosler, who had launched a tirade of abuse in his direction.

Both men were separated by their respective backroom staff and the unsavoury incident proved the main talking point in the post-match press conference.

Peeters said: 'We scored the second goal and I started running and celebrating. I didn't know where to go.

'He said, 'Don't come and celebrate in my corner', but I'm not going to mention the other words he said to me.

'I need to keep my composure and go away because I know it is emotional in a game where you score in the 94th minute with a deflected shot.

'In that moment, I need to be smarter and just step away. I lost my composure a bit.

'I apologise before my players that I lost my composure. I need to be strong in every moment, but I'm not going to apologise to him because he said things to me. Never ever.'

Rosler gave his version of events and said: 'My colleague was running 25-30 metres to celebrate right in front of our bench and I told him what I thought about this.'

Asked if he was friends with Peeters now, Rosler replied, 'We are colleagues, put it that way.'

It took a little of the gloss off a fine victory for Charlton against one of the Championship favourites.

Peeters' side went ahead after eight minutes when Jordan Cousins produced a superb strike into the top corner beyond Scott Carson.

Callum McManaman levelled for Wigan in the 22nd minute - the Lancashire's club first ever goal at the Valley - before Moussa struck via a deflection off Robert Kiernan to hand a delighted Peeters his first league win in charge.

Peeters added: 'I'm very happy to get the three points because when you see the chances we created especially in the last 20 minutes then we needed to score earlier.

'If you can win the game then the 94th minute with a deflected shot makes you very happy because we put a lot of effort into this game.

'I'm very happy for Franck Moussa because he came on and gave us the goal and the three points.'

Wigan are still searching for their first win in the league this season and Rosler said: 'Last week we won a point, this time we lost one. It's not only the timing of the goal. it's a deflected goal.

'I felt for the first 30 minutes we were in complete control and passed the ball well. We could have created one or two bigger chances.

'Their goal came against the run of play, but we responded well through Callum. In the second half there was nothing between the two sides and the goal was cruel.'
