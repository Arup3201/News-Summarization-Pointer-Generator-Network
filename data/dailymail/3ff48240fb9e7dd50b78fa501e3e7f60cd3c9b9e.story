This is the hilarious moment a man experienced the full force of a slingshot ride.  

The unnamed man retches seven times during the one-minute ride in a Malaysian theme park.

As the woman next to him dissolves into laughter he begins to scream and even waggles his tongue around. 

A hilarious video shows the moment an unnamed man retches seven times during a one-minute ride in a Malaysian theme park

The whole astounding episode is captured by the ride's camera.

At the start of the clip the couple are seen being strapped into their seats and look decidedly nervous. 

At first it is the unnamed woman who is scared and she laughs as she tells the man she does not want to look.

But as the attendant completes a five-second countdown the man loses his smile - and his dignity.

As the woman laughs the man can be seen clutching his head. At one point he even starts  screaming: 'I regret this'

As the pair are catapulted around 150 metres in the air he begins to clutch at the seat's metal bars and squeezes his eyes closed.

He then wildly looks around before retching and waving his arms about.

At one point he even starts hitting his head and screaming: 'I regret this.'

His companion does her best to distract him and shouts: 'It's already going down. Relax.' 

When this does not work she tells him to close his eyes - before dissolving into laughter.

The clip ends with the woman cackling as the man sits hunched in his seat.  

It is thought that slingshot rides can travel at speeds of 100 miles per hour.
