Carry On film legend Leslie Phillips is in hospital after he had a stroke during a shopping trip to London's Oxford Street.

The 90-year-old actor was taken ill on Saturday and is now in a 'stable' condition at a top London clinic, where he is expected to spend at least a month.

His wife Zara said his millions of fans would want to support  the film legend, who featured in more than 150 movies including the Carry On series where he was famous for lecherous catchphrases such as 'ding dong' and 'hellooo!'.

Much-loved: Carry On film legend Leslie Phillips (left in the 1970s) is in hospital after he had a stroke during a shopping trip to London's Oxford Street. His wife Zara (with him right) said he was in a stable condition

Respected: The actor continued working recently and voiced the Sorting Hat of the Harry Potter films

His wife, who is in her mid-50s and married the star nine months ago, was with him when he was taken ill on a bus as it reached their home in Maida Vale, west London.

'Leslie suddenly started leaning on me and was unable to put a ticket in his coat pocket,' she said.

'He had terrible pains in his left arm so I stopped the bus and called an ambulance which took him to University College Hospital in Euston.

'He kept saying to me "don’t cause a fuss", but I knew he was unwell and needed urgent medical help.

'From there, he was then transferred to a top neurosurgery hospital in the capital.'

The father-of-four is undergoing medical tests and his wife said she hoped he would soon return home.  

'Leslie is very strong and I’m sure he will pull through,' she added.

'I love him to bits and I know his millions of fans will want to wish him well for the future.'

The veteran star embarked on his third marriage in December last year, telling reporters with a roguish smile: 'I thought I’d better get on with my life and marry Zara'.

His Turkish-born wife had been a constant companion since the 2011 suicide of the actor's  second wife, the former Bond girl Angela Scoular. 

The Tottenham-born film legend was still working before the stroke, voicing the Sorting Hat of the Harry Potter films and acting in several British TV dramas including the Ruth Rendell Mysteries, Revolver and Agatha Christie's Marple.

He was born on April 20, 1924, into a working class family and made his first film appearances as a child in the 1930s.

Screen legend: Phillips was made a CBE by the Queen in 2008 for services to drama and is now 90 years old

Honours: The actor was born in Tottenham and received the Freedom of the City of London in 2010

He is believed to be the only actor still alive who performed at Pinewood Studios in its first week after opening in 1936.

During the Second World War, he was commissioned in 1943 as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, and transferred to the Durham Light Infantry in 1944.

But he later left after being declared unfit for service with a neurological condition that caused partial paralysis.

Phillips returned to the stage and screen and became a household name as a star in the Carry On films and the Doctor comedy series in the 1960s onwards.

He was a  friend of the late Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees and the late actor Peter O'Toole, and recently helped fund the memorial to the Bomber Command in Green Park.

His trademark rounded vowels came after his mother sent him to stage school to lose his Cockney accent - but he has never lost sight of his roots and has often been paraded around White Hart Lane as a celebrity football fan.

He was made an OBE in  1998 and a CBE in 2008 for services to drama.
