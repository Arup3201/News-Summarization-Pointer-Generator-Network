Fresh evidence has emerged that Rebekah Brooks has not fully cut ties with News International, after it was alleged that she will be hanging on to her chauffeur-driven car, paid for by the company.

It adds weight to claims that Mrs Brooks is being lined up for a senior role in Rupert Murdoch's empire once the phone-hacking scandal has died down.

The former News International chief executive, who was also News of the World editor, resigned on July 15 following claims that journalists at the Sunday tabloid hacked into murdered teenager Milly Dowler's voicemail while she was in charge.

Rebekah Brooks has allegedly been told by Rupert Murdoch to travel until the scandal quietens down and then he will find her another role

A former colleague told the Daily Telegraph: 'Brooks has been allowed to keep her chauffeur-driven car for two years.'

A News International spokesman was unable to comment on the allegations today.

Representatives for 43-year-old Mrs Brooks added: 'We are unable to comment on the contractual arrangements for the conclusion of Rebekah’s employment at News International.'

It comes as News International faced fresh accusations yesterday that  phone-hacking was ‘widely discussed’ at the News Of The World and was condoned by former editor Andy Coulson.

A letter, penned by disgraced royal correspondent Clive Goodman, said hacking was carried out by other members of staff and ‘with the full knowledge and support’ of the paper’s senior managers.

It was written by Goodman to parent company News 
International’s head of human resources four years ago, but its 
existence was made public only yesterday by a 
committee of MPs.

Questions: Former editors of News Of the World Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks. Further allegations of phone hacking have emerged at the now-defunct tabloid

It marks a dramatic escalation of the scandal which has already led to the closure of the paper.

After repeated calls for her resignation, Mrs Brooks finally handed in her notice last month.

Mrs Brooks has firmly denied any knowledge and branded the actions of the journalists, who allegedly hacked into thousands of people's phones, as 'unthinkable'.

In an internal email to staff telling them that she was standing down, she wrote: 'I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt.

'I now need to concentrate on correcting the distortions and rebutting the allegations about my record as a journalist.'

Rumours have also appeared on the internet suggesting the media tycoon has advised Mrs Brooks to 'travel the world' until the hacking and bribery scandal quietens down and then he'll find her another role.

The Daily Telegraph had earlier reported a 
source claimed: 'My understanding is that Rupert has 
told her to travel the world on him for a year and then he will find a 
job for her when the scandal has died down.'

The comments will stoke the fury of 
the public, hacking victims and MPs who have been outraged at the litany
of allegations that have surfaced about News International.
