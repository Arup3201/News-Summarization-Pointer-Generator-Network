A couple of retired doctors have spent the past three years on a quest to taste the best burgers the U.S. has to offer.

Joe and Doris Lindner were visiting their daughter in Denver, Colorado in October 2010 when they read a USA Today article listing the nation’s ‘51 Great Burger Joints.’

Noting that the Colorado recommendation, Park Burger, was nearby the couple decided to check it out. 

Joe and Doris Lindner have eaten burgers in all 50 states over the past three years and ended their journey in Hawaii in April

Impressed with what they tasted, the couple then decided to also try the recommendations for the states they traveled through on their way home to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.

By the time they got home, the couple had also tried the recommended burgers in Kansas, Missouri and Tennessee.

‘When we got home and realized we’d already done four, we said “why not?’” Doris Linder told Hawaii247, explaining how the hunt for a local burger recommendation had quickly turned into a cross-country challenge.

Over the next three years the couple made it their mission to travel the length and breadth of the nation tasting great burgers from the list. 

Where it all began: The Linders started their burger odyssey at Park Burger in Denver back in Oct 2010

The list included one joint for each state, plus the District of Columbia, each recommended by a local foodie.

Due to the bad economy two places on the list closed before the Linders got to try their burgers, but even in those instances the couple still visited the joints and had their photos taken outside.

By July 2012, the couple had ticked off all but one of the 51 joints listed in the original article.

Then finally in April the Linders paid a visit to Hawaii to complete their burger odyssey with a trip to Village Burger Kamuela in Waimea.

Symbolically the couple enjoyed their final burger from the list with the same members of their family that they had started the journey back in Denver in October 2010.

In between they've tried all kinds of burger, some more exotic than others, including a kangaroo burger.

When quizzed about which was the best burger, Joe Linder gave that precious accolade to the Village Burger slider, also the last burger on the list.

‘I’ve always said the best burger is the last one I ate. But I’ll be absolutely honest with you, that WAS the best one ever,’ said Joe.

According to Joe the whole journey was about more than just trying out a lot of different types of burgers.

‘It’s really the people along the way that made it so much fun and a few who weren’t that charming,’ Joe Linder told Hawaii247.

‘But our country is so wonderful, whether it’s North Dakota or downtown Los Angeles, they all have their own flavor. It’s been a great time.’
