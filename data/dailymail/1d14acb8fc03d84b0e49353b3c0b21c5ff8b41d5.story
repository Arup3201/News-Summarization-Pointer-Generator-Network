John Garner was discovered last week off the coast of St Vincent floating in the water wearing a life jacket, around 200 feet away from his yacht

A British sailor found seriously injured close to his burning yacht in the Caribbean died from injuries consistent with an explosion, police have said.

Officers on the island of St Vincent had launched a murder investigation following the death of John Garner, 53, and described his girlfriend as a 'person of interest'.

However, following the results of the post-mortem they said they no longer wanted to question her, the Associated Press has reported.

Mr Garner was discovered last week off the coast of St Vincent floating in the water wearing a life jacket, around 200 feet away from his yacht. He was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.

Police said he was alone on board the boat during the apparent explosion and that his Norwegian girlfriend had left the island a couple of days earlier.

Sailing experts have said it is not uncommon for people to die from propane stove explosions.

Diving instructor Kay Wilson who discovered Mr Garner, said there was so much black smoke that by the time she reached the stricken boat it had already been engulfed by flames.

She said: 'It was almost razed to the water line, and the heat and the smoke which were coming were just incredible.'

The vessel was 'almost underwater' and it looked like Mr Garner had tried to deploy his life raft but it did not deploy properly, she said.

Ms Wilson added: 'Behind the boat there was debris in every direction and the wind was carrying the debris from the boat.

'I think it was an indication there had been an explosion on board because there was so much stuff in the water - garbage from the galley and small pieces of debris.

'We found him (Mr Garner) very close relatively to his yacht, probably about 150-200 feet downwind, floating in the water.

A local TV station posted this picture believed to be of the yacht on fire off the coast of St Vincent

'He was wearing a lifejacket that inflates when you hit the water. It had inflated and was holding him up.'

Mr Garner is believed to have been spending time on the Grenadines island of Bequia with another family member and planned to make his way to Antigua.

The yacht is reportedly named Asante and registered in Gibraltar.

A 
sailing friend in Norway, where Mr Garner has lived for many years, said
 the grandfather was ultra-fit and previously worked as a 
physical trainer for British special forces.

The
 friend said on Thursday: ‘It is very shocking news. He was a very nice 
man. He loved his yacht, Asante, and he was meticulous about the way he 
kept it. He had a military attitude towards things and was a strict 
sailing instructor.

Diving instructor Kay Wilson (pictured here on Skype) has said she believes Mr Garner's death was an accident

‘He 
is what you would call an English gentleman. He trained the special 
forces in Britain, the SAS I believe, although he was a civilian and did
 not have a rank.'

The friend said they had previously spoken about the dangers of travelling to St Vincent.

Mr Garner's yacht, Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off the coast of St. Vincent

‘Me
 and John spoke about St Vincent many times. In the yachting society, St
 Vincent is somewhere you sailed straight past and did not stop at.

‘It was not a safe place, it was a place to avoid. People were worried about thefts and robberies and rapes.

‘Boat
 boys would try to help you to anchor, when you did not need help, and 
then charge you money. You paid them because you feared they would come 
back at night time.

‘I told John this but he would say that it was okay and that he did not have a problem with them.'

On Wednesday, pictures emerged of the burning boat, with plumes of black smoke billowing out.

The
 yacht, called Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off 
the beautiful coastal resort of Buccament, south-west of the island, 
which boasts several five-star hotels.

Mr Garner had previously advertised sailing trips around the British Virgin Islands for between £5,500 and £9,000.

The
 online advertisement offers a journey around a ‘beautiful area’ and 
lessons in navigation, boat handling and overboard practice, among other
skills.

It states: ‘The instructor of Asante, John Edward Garner is Norwegian / English and he is also the owner of the boat.

The Asante was described as 'a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty' with four sleeping cabin

‘Skipper
 and instructor John at Asante is a graduate of the English Yachtmaster 
system and Yachtmaster Ocean from England, and has sailed far.’

The boat is described as ‘a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty’ with four sleeping cabins.

The course was described as suitable for beginners and adheres to ‘British Royal Yachting Association’s rules’.
