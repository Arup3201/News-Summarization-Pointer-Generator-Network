India's rape crisis grew yet deeper today when it emerged a schoolgirl died two weeks after a boy who tried to rape her set her on fire - with the help of his parents.

The 15-year-old, from Jigna village in northeast India, was rushed to hospital after the January 6 attack with horrific burns to 80 per cent of her body.

Despite doctors battling for two weeks to keep her alive, she died of her injuries on Sunday.

Police have charged Gyan Singh and his parents with murder following her death and say all three face the death penalty if found guilty.

Protest: There has been a groundswell of protest in India since a student was gang raped on a bus and left to die, with mass demonstrations for women's rights, tougher rape laws and calls for sex attackers to be hanged

It is claimed the three doused her in petrol and lit a match because they were afraid she  might lodge a complaint against Singh who had tried to sexually assault her the previous day.

'With the girl's death we have enough evidence to press for death penalty for Singh and his parents who had been arrested immediately after she was admitted to hospital,' Senior Superintendent of Police of Allahabad Mohit Agrawl said.

It is the latest in a chain of high-profile rapes in recent months that have shaken India to its core, triggering nationwide self-reflection and soul searching.

The first, on December 16 last year, saw a 23-year-old medical student gang raped on a private bus by five men in New Delhi before she was thrown, fatally injured and unclothed, into the road and left to die.

Thirteen days later she died in hospital. The men alleged to have attacked her are awaiting trial for her rape and murder.

There has been a groundswell protest in India ever since, with mass demonstrations for women's rights, tougher rape laws and calls for sex attackers to be hanged.

Meanwhile last week, a fast-track court set up exclusively
 to deal with cases of crime against women has imposed the death penalty
 on a 56-year-old man for raping and murdering a minor.

The act was termed 'heinous' and included in the category of rarest of the rare.

complex, awarded capital punishment to Bharat Singh, a guard at a

Rape is the one of the most common crimes against Indian women.

So common, in fact, that there is a euphemism coined for the public sexual molestation of women.

In reference to the biblical 'Eve', 'Eve teasing' implies that women are responsible for the behaviour of their attackers.

Rape victims rarely press charges because of social stigma and fear they will be accused of inviting the attack.

Many women say they structure their lives around protecting themselves and their daughters from attack.

New Delhi is the rape capital of India with a rape reported on average every 18 hours.

Government data show the number of reported rape cases in the country rose by nearly 17 percent between 2007 and 2011.

As
 well as the death sentence, the court imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on 
Singh under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

On January 15, hundreds of people surrounded a school in  the city of Vasco da Gama in Goa to protest after a seven-year-old girl was allegedly raped in the toilets next door to the headmistress's office.

A day earlier, six men were arrested after another alleged gang rape of a woman on a bus in New Delhi.

The victim had been travelling to her in-laws house in Punjab on Friday when she was allegedly snatched and to a district bordering Amritsar, the Sikh holy city.

Five men joined the driver and conductor, who had taken her by motorbike to an unknown address, and took turns to rape the 29-year-old.

But these are just a handful of cases that have reached public attention in recent months.

In 'rape capital' New Delhi, police data revealed as many as 706 cases of rape - almost two per day - were registered in 2012, which is around 24 per cent more than the 572 cases reported in 2011.

Even worse, the city witnessed 45 rapes (three in a day) and 75 cases of molestation (five in a day on an average) in 15 days after the December 16 gang rape of the 23-year-old paramedic in a moving bus in South Delhi.
