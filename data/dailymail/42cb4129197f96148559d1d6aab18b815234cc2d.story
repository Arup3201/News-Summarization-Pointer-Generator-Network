University footballers have been banned from wearing their kit - after getting it sponsored by the world's third-biggest porn site.

The players in Canterbury, Kent, had joked online about Pornhub sponsoring Rutherford Raiders, a team named after the father of nuclear physics Ernest Rutherford which plays twice a week.

To their surprise the site got in touch to volunteer its cash - and kitted them out with branded orange and black shirts along with much-needed shorts and socks.

But the move did not stand up to scrutiny by academic chiefs, who had a stern word with the students days later and banned them from wearing their new kit. 

One team member told student news website The Tab: 'We are struggling to see why they are having a problem. The university cricket team are sponsored by Kingfisher which is also a age restricted product.

'The university rugby team once had training shirts with ‘80 minutes, 15 positions, no protection, wanna ruck?

'In my opinion the decision is made by people that are out of touch with what’s socially acceptable.

'It’s hard for football teams to find a sponsor. I personally haven’t come across anyone yet that has found it anything other than funny.'

Not impressed: A spokesman for the university (pictured) said the shirts will not be allowed to be worn

University spokesman Martin Herrema, however, said: 'The University of Kent sports department would never sanction sponsorship of this type - it is totally inappropriate.

'The team has been spoken with and will not be allowed to wear the shirts in question at any time.

'We take this issue very seriously and inter-college sports teams, which are the responsibility of Kent Sport, must present any potential sponsorship and/or logos for approval.'

Kent's student union and feminist society did not immediately return requests for comment.

Pornhub is the world's 77th-most visited website and third most popular porn website, according to traffic ranking site Alexa.

It claimed to have 14.7billion visitors last year - 1.68million per hour - and 63.2billion video views.

The row comes weeks after the men's rugby club at London School of Economics - one of the world's top universities - was banned from playing for a year after handing out a sexist leaflet to first-year students.

Scattered throughout the printed leaflets were demeaning references to 'Poly' students, from supposedly inferior former Polytechnics which have since become other universities.

They also described women as 'tasty', 'beast-like' and 'mingers', suggesting they only wanted to play sport so they could go drinking with men.

Initiations, the booklets suggested, would not tolerate 'Poly activities that involve faeces, genitalia, and outright homosexual debauchery'. 

Another section suggested a committee member embodied everything the club holds dear - 'debauchery, hedonism and misogyny'. 

Members of the club were encouraged to bring two bottles of wine each to a Friday night social, or three if they are 'Russian'. 

Furore: The incident comes weeks after LSE men's rugby club was banned for giving this leaflet to freshers

Last month a survey claimed a third of women have been victims of university 'lad culture'.

The study was commissioned by the National Union of Students, which accused university authorities of not doing enough to stop young women suffering inappropriate behaviour.

The move prompted amused reactions when it emerged online.

Canterbury resident Tom Hendry, 42, said: 'If they could score on the pitch as often as they score on Pornhub, they’d be challenging for the Premiership.' 

The ban has left the Raiders sponsorless just a year after they won the University of Kent's intercollege league.

But as one online commenter observed: 'I imagine they will come first this year too.'
