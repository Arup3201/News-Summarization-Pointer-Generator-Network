Amid the 4,000 graves of his fallen comrades, D-Day veteran Ken Scott struggles from his wheelchair to his feet.

Supported on either side, his tears fall as the Last Post rings out across Bayeux Cemetery.

Wearing his original forage cap and a replica Second World War uniform adorned with medals, the 98-year-old former platoon sergeant with the Durham Light Infantry manages to raise his shaking hand to salute the Queen and those who gave their lives for freedom.

Farewell: Ken Scott, paying what he says is his final visit to his fallen friends, is lifted to his feet for the Last Post

Yesterday, on the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, he spoke for the first time of the unimaginable horror and bloodshed that greeted his landing craft on Gold Beach.

‘I always said I’d take it to my grave but people should know,’ he said. ‘I’m coming near to the end of my life now and people should know history and what it was like.’

One of the oldest D-Day veterans, Mr Scott, from Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, had a distinguished campaign as a Desert Rat in North Africa from 1940-1943, including fighting at the battle of El Alamein. Then came the D-Day landings.

He was 28 when he boarded a train in Cambridge before being transferred to a landing craft at  Plymouth.

‘It was the dead of night and we had no idea we were going to France,’ he added. ‘We smoked ourselves to death as we were so frightened.’ 

Poignant: Mr Scott and the graves of the comrades he lost 70 years ago

He then recalled the horrifying moments as his landing craft reached the target beach. ‘When the ramp came down we were scared stiff,’ he said. ‘There were bodies floating in the water, some were injured.

‘They had met the machine guns and you couldn’t help them. They were crying out “give us a hand buddy”. Some of them were calling for their mothers.

‘We just had to keep going – we pushed them to one side, we just couldn’t help them.’

Wiping away tears and with his voice trembling, he continued: ‘It’s been with me ever since. I don’t tell many people but it does upset me.

‘Bodies were just lying there, they were just floating and the water was red. You were looking after yourself, you were so frightened.

‘I remember the smell of the cordite and the noise from the navy shelling – we were trying to defend ourselves. I will never forget that.’

Helping hand: Mr Scott speaks with a helper during the memorial service held at the cemetery

Mr Scott, who has a son John, says this will be his last pilgrimage to Normandy.

He said he was determined to stand up during the last post, adding: ‘I wouldn’t have missed that for the world. This is the end.

‘I can go home and just relax –  this is all finished now. I won’t come here again. I can put it all [the war] behind me.’

After the war, Mr Scott ran a dry cleaning shop with his wife Barbara, who died in 2007.

He was also instrumental in helping to start the repatriation parades through his hometown of Royal Wootton Bassett.

He said: ‘I saw a coffin draped in a Union Jack one day – and thought it was one of us old boys. When I found out it was a soldier from Afghanistan, I thought his repatriation should be marked.

‘So I phoned the MoD and told them to let me know when our boys were brought back – and that’s how it started.’

Respect: Mr Scott, right, was one of hundred of veterans at the emotional Bayeux service
