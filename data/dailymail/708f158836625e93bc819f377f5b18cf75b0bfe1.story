Two reckless teenagers have been pictured dicing with death as they tried their hand at the dangerous urban sport of free-running over.

A friend videoed the pair's stunt as they dashed across the arches of the Foryd Bridge in Rhyl, in Wales, 30ft above a fast flowing, frigid River Clwyd.

Cars thundered beneath the two teens as stunned passers-by watched on in horror.

Reckless: A friend videos the two teens are they dare each other to run over the top of the Foryd Bridge in Rhyl

A single slip or a gust of wind would have sent them hurtling towards the busy carriageway 30ft beneath or 50ft into the water.

They were spotted at about 3.15pm on Sunday making three passes over the arches.

Photographer Geoff Abbott, who spotted the youths, told the Daily Post newspaper:
'If they had fallen, it would have been over for them. If they’d landed
on the road, they would have been killed. It’s totally irresponsible.

'The younger of the two was a very young lad and, as a parent, I was very worried about him in particular.

Danger: One of the youngsters, wearing only trainers and jogging bottoms, led his friend down the slippery arch towards a set of steel railings meant to keep them off

Security issue: The dangerous stunt has led to calls to tighten security around the bridge which has a set of spiked railings at the foot of each arch to prevent people climbing them

Mr
Abbott then watched as they group checked the mobile phone footage of 
the stunt, then decided to run across the 20meter arch for a third 
time.

The incident has provoked calls to tighten security on the steel crossing which is known locally as the blue bridge.

The
area’s councillor has called for security features at the bridge to be 
examined in light of the incident, which she described as 'frightening'.

Inches from disaster: A sudden gust of wind or a slip could have sent the youngsters tumbling into the river below

Police have seen the photographs, but decided not to investigate.

Inspector Jason Devonport said: 'We won't be investigating this matter but we will be putting out safety advice.'

Joan
Butterfield, county councillor for Rhyl West, said called for safety at the bridge to be 
examined.

She said any slip from the duo could have caused a serious accident. She added that she would be contacting police to discuss measures needed to prevent a repeat of this dangerous incident.

Looks wide enough to be a footpath to me.  Just no hand rails which is what has Health and Safety all in knots about I bet.

The police should investigate.  Even if those two aren't bothered about their own safety, they put the passing motorists in danger.

It doesn't matter - they look old enough to take responsibility for what they're doing.

Oooh teenagers doing the same stunts that countless previous generations of teens have got up to. You simply can't wrap them up in cotton wool! Taking risks is what lads that are growing up do, always have done, and always will.
