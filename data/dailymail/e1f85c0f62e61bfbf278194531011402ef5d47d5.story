A conman who duped investors into buying at least $380,000 worth of yogurt-based anti-aging cream has been sentenced to a decade in prison.

Joseph Fox Batista, 59, managed to convince buyers that his bogus cream could combat aging and promote hair regrowth.

A  jury last week convicted the self-described microbiologist from South Beach, Florida, of second-degree grand theft, the Miami Herald reported.

He was  sentenced to 10 years in prison plus five years of probation and ordered to pay $40,000 to six investors.

His yogurt cream claimed to regrow hair on balding men, get rid of grey hair and generally reverse the whole aging process. 

His pitch was based around an enzyme known as telomerase, which was discovered in the early 1980s and is thought to slow the decline of the body's cells.

But scientists say research is still basic and has not shown that successfully introducing the enzyme into the body can reverse aging.

In a 2011 interview with the Miami Herald, Fox -who claimed he was the nephew of former Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista - insisted he never stole money.

He claimed that shadowy forces, including the hair-transplant industry, were conspiring to hold back his company, Telogenesis Inc.

'Obviously, I have to be paid. I'm the CEO of a corporation. The CEO gets at least $100,000 a year,' Fox told the paper. 'I'm actually paying myself very little — at times, nothing. I have running costs. I have to pay my rent. I have to feed myself. I'm doing the work of 1,000 people.'

Fox was known on the streets of South Beach for his bowl haircut and fondness for white Panama hats, guayabera shirts and sparkly dress shoes.

He claimed that the money from investors was used for lab testing, clinical trials, production and marketing. 

But after combing through bank records and interviewing victims, it was found that most of the cash invested from July 2007 to November 2009 went toward Fox's daily living expenses, including alcohol, drugs and lavish meals for friends.

In 2002, Fox was convicted in California of ripping off investors after promising a machine that claimed to weigh the amount of gold in any object.

'He had so much faith in himself. I don't even think he knows he's crazy,' a former roommate told the Herald in 2011. 'He truly thinks he's the smartest person in the world.'
