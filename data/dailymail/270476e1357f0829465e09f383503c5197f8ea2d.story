Making history: Five-month-old Evie-Mae was christened in the Edwardian gown last weekend in Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire

Giggling Evie-Mae Lowe is only five months old, but already she has made history.

The baby girl, from Church, Lancashire, has become the fifth generation of the same family to be christened in an Edwardian gown, hand-stitched more than 100 years ago.

The unique garment has been passed around an estimated 17 members of her extended family in that time.

The 103-year-old dress is made of fine cotton with a pink tuck top and a white tier 
skirt embroidered with cotton lace.

And last weekend it was Evie-Mae's turn to wear it during a service at St Mary's RC Church in Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire.

She follows in the footsteps of her father Ryan, grandfather Graham, great-grandmother Margaret and great-great-grandmother Madge to be christened in the gown over the past century.

Her grandmother Gillian Lowe, 49, said the family wants to keep the tradition going as long as possible.

She said: 'It’s kept safe by Evie’s 
great-grandma Margaret who washes it in a special liquid and keeps it 
safe in a special box. There are no stains or holes. It has kept.

'Evie-Mae is the fifth generation in her family line to wear it but there have been 17 in total if you take into account other cousins and great-uncles and people like that down the years who have worn it.

'It’s a very nice, unique and a special thing to have in our family. I would like my other son to use it when he has a child one day.'

Victorian and Edwardian christening gowns are seeing a resurgence in popularity in recent years following the success of period drama TV shows such as Downton Abbey and The Paradise.

Linda Patrick, owner of bespoke christening wear business Little Doves, said recently she has seen an upsurge in the number of enquiries about authentic gowns.

Christening gown gained popularity during the Victorian era when families were often large and it was useful to pass them down from one sibling to the next.

The Church insisted that babies were christened in white as a symbol of purity and innocence of a child.

The Royal family used the same christening gown, first commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1841, for 167 years.

Thought to have been made from the same Spitalfields silk as the Queen's wedding dress, it was kept in an air tight container and washed in sanitised water to try and preserve it for future generations.

In 2008, it was finally retired and the Queen commissioned a replica gown to be made for James, Viscount Severn, the infant son of the Duke and Duchess of Wessex.

It is expected to be used by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for the christening of their first child, due in a month's time.
