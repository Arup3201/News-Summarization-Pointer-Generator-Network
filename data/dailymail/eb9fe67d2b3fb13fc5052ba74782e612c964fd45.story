A woman has been caught trying to smuggle $45,000 worth of cocaine into New York in the handles of her luggage, federal authorities claim. 

Chevelle Rusheen Nesbeth hid 2.5 pounds of the drug in the metal poles of multiple suitcases before flying from Jamaica's Montego Bay to New York's Kennedy Airport, according to a charge sheet. 

She has been arrested and faces federal narcotics smuggling charges.

It wasn't immediately known if she had a lawyer. 

According to the Department of Homeland Security, Nesbeth was detained after a spot-check of luggage at arrivals on Tuesday.

Inspectors felt that each of her cases had one unusually dense handle. 

Nesbeth was escorted to a private search room where officers discovered a white powdery substance in the hand rails which tested positive for cocaine.

'This latest seizure demonstrates the vigilance of our CBP officers, and their excellence in detecting those who would try to smuggle these illegal substances,' said Robert E. Perez, director of field operations in New York.
