Two 16-year-old boys in Wylie, Texas are facing first-degree murder charges after confessing to killing a 17-year-old classmate over the weekend.

Police in Garland, Texas found the two unidentified teens burying the body of Wylie East High School senior Ivan Mejia, 17, in a wooded area near the Firewheel Mall on Saturday night.

'We are burying a body,' the teens allegedly said after getting caught.

Gone: Wylie East High School senior Ivan Mejia was murdered over the weekend and two of his classmates confessed to the crime

Police in Garland, Texas found the two boys while investigating a report of a suspicious unoccupied car that veered off State Highway 78.

'After fleeing and coming back to their vehicle they basically told the officers you caught us,' Sgt Donna Valdenpena of the Wylie Police Department said.

All three boys attended Wylie East High School, and the alleged murder is said to have taken place behind the school.

The two teen suspects then transported the body 10 miles away to a wooded area near the Firewheel mall to bury, where they were caught.

Mourners: Friends of Mejia gather at a vigil Sunday night

Scene of the crime: The two 16-year-old subjects and Mejia were all students at Wylie East High School. The murder allegedly took place behind the school

Memorialized: Friends of Mejia remembered him at a vigil held Sunday night

The two boys were arrested and charged with first-degree murder. They are currently being held at the Collin County Juvenile Detention center without bond. Their names are not being released because they are underage and police have not released a motive in the killing.

Friends of Mejia gathered to remember the ROTC student at a vigil held Sunday night.

'Ivan was dedicated to the Marines,' fellow ROTC student Cody Wilson told the Dallas Morning News.

'Every time we had something to do with Marines, he was always front and center, always watching, always listening,' Wilson said. 'I could tell he wanted it bad. I knew in my heart he would have been the best.' 

Wylie school district spokesman Ian 
Halperin issued a statement following Mejia's slaying, saying his death 
was not connected to any school event and that counselors would be 
brought in to help students cope with the loss this week.

'The
 entire Wylie ISD community is shocked and saddened by this senseless 
act,' Halperin said. 'We are cooperating with the police as they 
investigate, and we hope they will be able to provide us with some 
understanding of how this tragedy unfolded.'
