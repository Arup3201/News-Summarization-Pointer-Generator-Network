 Sgt Bowe Bergdahl, the US soldier who spent five years in Taliban captivity, plans to leave the Army and go to college if he is cleared of desertion by an inquiry.

The 28-year-old's attorney said he was 'ready to move on' as a civilian if he is given an honorable discharge by the investigation into his capture.

The inquiry, led by Major General Kenneth R Dahl, had been due to report back by this week, but it was announced today that this would now be delayed until next month.

Mystery: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl spent five years as a Taliban prisoner after vanishing from his post in 2009

Sgt Bergdahl disappeared from his post in Paktika, Afghanistan, on June 30, 2009, while serving with the 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, which is based at Fort Richardson, Alaska.

In a scenario widely compared to the storyline of TV series Homeland, he then spent almost five years in Taliban captivity before he was released on May 31 this year in a controversial exchange for five prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay.

Since Sgt Bergdahl's release, several soldiers who served alongside him have claimed that he left his post voluntarily, prompting calls for him to be charged with desertion. It has also been claimed that several troops were killed or wounded in searches for him.

Sgt Bergdahl would be eligible for college funding under the GI Bill if he received an honorable discharge.

Inquiry: The US Army's probe into the case by Major General Kenneth R Dahl has been delayed till next month

Eugene Fidell, his lawyer, said: 'He's ready to move on. We're hoping for the best. College education is in the cards for him.'

According to the Business Insider, Mr Fidell played down the delay to Maj Gen Dahl's probe, claiming 'it is no big thing' and that the investigator was just 'tying up loose ends'.

Mr Fidell added: 'We're just hoping all the facts come out.' 

A US Army statement on the delay said: 'As the investigating officer works through this final stage, it is possible that he will have to follow up on issues that may require additional witness interviews.'

Once Maj Gen Dahl's report is complete, it will be subject to a legal review that could further delay a decision on Sgt Bergdahl's fate. 

Upon his release, Sgt Bergdahl was initially flown to Germany before being taken to the Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas for medical tests. 

He has since been assigned administrative duties at Fort Sam Houston in Texas.

He was questioned by Maj Gen Dahl for two days earlier this month.

In the hit TV series Homeland, a US Marines sniper played by Damian Lewis returns home to the US after spending eight years as an Al Qaeda prisoner in Iraq.
