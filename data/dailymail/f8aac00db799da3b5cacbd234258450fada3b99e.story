Retired Australian tennis champion Paul McNamee has put his stunning Victorian residence on the market this week.

The 1930's mansion in Malvern has sold seven times since 1987, with Paul and his wife Lesley paying $6 million in May 2008.

The current asking price for the property is a tidy $7.5, which estate agent Mark Wridgway says reflects market forces.

Not only is this property gorgeous, but it offers some well-connected neighbours- it is just down the road from the  house labelled the most expensive in Australia, whose previous owners included the late Prime Minister Robert Menzies.

The statuesque family home blends period detail with more contemporary spaces throughout the property, making it 'very comfortable and ready to move into,' said Mark. 

The house is enviably position North West, ensuring plenty of natural light. In fact, said Mark, 'by 12 o'clock the whole place is simply flooded with sunlight.'

Offering five bedrooms plus an extra study, this is a family home with so many bonuses, such as the championship north to south tennis court.

That may have been expected from the former tennis player, who won two single and 23 double titles in his career. 

McNamee won the 1979 and 1983 Australian Open and the 1980 and 1982 Wimbledon Championships with his partners, and is still an avid member of the tennis circuit.

One of the reasons he and wife Lesley are parting with the beautiful residence is his coaching, which sees him travelling nationally and overseas.

'Paul’s gone back to coaching, which means he's travelling a lot more and is away close to half a year,' said Mark.

'He used to be stationed in Melbourne, but not any more. He and Lesley only have one child, who is heading off to study Law at university next year.'

'It's a large property. That's a lot of house for Lesley.'

The mansion boasts glorious spaces, including a grand entrance hall, a magnificent formal sitting and separate dining rooms

The 1930's mansion does indeed boast of glorious spaces, including a grand entrance hall, a magnificent formal sitting and separate dining rooms.

As well as the five bedrooms, the house offers three sensational fully tiled bathrooms and a master en-suite with enormous dressing room and city skyline views.

'The house uses the land so well, which is why it's been labelled the best house in Malvern,' said estate agent Mark.

'It's surrounded by large estate, and has great street appeal. The circular driveway is another bonus, and it's a great lifestyle property. It's close to all the action.'

The property's kitchen adjoins to the meals area, with a bright family room which opens onto a beautiful paved entertaining area.

The outside terrace overlooks expansive and private manicured gardens, offering views of the heated pool and inbuilt trampoline.

The generous allotment of approximately 2155 square metres means there is plenty of room to expand, with Mark suggesting that an avid tennis fan could extend the tennis court even further.
