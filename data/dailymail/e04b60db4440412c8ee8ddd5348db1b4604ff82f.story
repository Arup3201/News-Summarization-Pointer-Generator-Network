A 40-year-old California man who works in construction has lost both of his hands and his job in a fireworks accident over Fourth of July weekend.

Alazar Ortiz was attempting to let off fireworks in the driveway of his mothers home in San Jose, near Cassel Park, about 10pm on Friday night while his family watched from nearby.

Relatives told authorities a 'professional-grade explosive' used to trigger the large fireworks display malfunctioned and blew up.
