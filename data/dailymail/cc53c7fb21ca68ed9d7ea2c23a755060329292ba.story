The mayor of Doral, Florida was forced to take back his request to give Donald Trump a key to the city after receiving complaints from the community this week. 

On Monday, Mayor Luigi Boria asked the city to honor Trump and Miss Universe President Paula M Shugart with keys to the city. 

But just two hours later, Boria redacted the key for Trump after news of the key spread and the community became outraged. 

No key for you: Luigi Boria, the mayor of Doral, Florida, asked the city to honor Donald Trump with a key this week for choosing them as host city for the Miss Universe pageant. He redacted that request just two hours later when community members expressed outrage. Boria pictured to the right of Trump, in a brown suit on January 9 at a Miss Universe welcome event 

'Trump doesn’t deserve my key,' Boria later said. 'I think it’s appropriate for Miss Universe and the Miss Universe organization to have the key. It doesn’t make sense for Trump to have one.'

Boria still wants to give a key to Shugart, and make January 25 Doral's official 'Miss Universe Day'.

Though Trump has invested some $300million into the city for the Miss Universe pageant later this month,  the billionaire businessman has become a controversial figure in Doral for his golf course there - the Trump National Doral. 

Residents surrounding the golf course are upset he obstructed their views by planting a barrier of palm trees around the course.

'Keys to the City should be reserved to be given to dignitaries and people of high importance, not to businessmen that benefit from our City,' Doral resident Claudia Spangaro Mariaca told the Miami Herald. 'Giving the Trump organization or the Miss Universe organization a Key at this time when there is so much controversy in our City would be a mistake, and a disloyal move from our Council.'

This isn't the first time that Boria has been criticized for his excessive gift of the town keys and is known in the community as 'the city's locksmith'. 

Last year, the City Council held a intervention on key giving saying they should only be awarded to people of 'very high commitment and importance'.

The 88 Miss Universe competitors started gathering in Doral last week in preparation for the January 25 pageant. They have been attending charity events across town, while also hitting the links at Red Tiger - the just-opened course at Trump National Doral.

And it appears that Doral isn't the only city in Florida where Trump is less than popular. 

News of the Trump's cancelled key  came the same day that he filed a $100million lawsuit against Palm Beach County, Florida.

The lawsuit claims spiteful officials have convinced air traffic controllers to redirect flights over his Mar-a-Lago estate, just to make him mad. 

He says the traffic over the ritzy beach club is causing damage to the historic building, finished in the 1920s for the Post cereal heiress. 

'I am saving one of the great houses of this country and one of its greatest landmarks,' he said in an interview Monday, 'and it's being badly damaged by the airplanes.'
