A Colorado woman walked down the aisle on Saturday in a wedding that almost didn't happen after the bride and her maid of honor were forced to jump from the third floor of their apartment after the building caught fire just five days before she was scheduled to tie the knot.

Lenise Brown and best friend Marilyn Kruc survived the massive blaze at their Copper Terrace Apartment complex in Centennial - just south of Denver - but Kruc broke her back while jumping from the apartment, and neither woman knew whether she'd be able to stand by her friend's side as she said her vows until the morning of the wedding.

Wearing a back brace, Kruc was by her best friend's side during Saturday's ceremony.

Lucky: Bride Lenise Brown is walked down the aisle by her father, Greg Ruff, just days after she survived a fire by jumping from her third floor apartment

Destroyed: The massive blaze completely destroyed several units in the apartment building where Brown lived with her best friend Marilyn Kruc

'I would consider her my sister.  I just have brothers so she’s the 
closest thing I have to a sister and I’m just so proud of her for her 
courage and her strength,' Brown tells 7News Denver. 'For her [to make] that trip, I know it was 
hard, it means a lot to us.'

Luckily, Brown only suffered burns to her hands and face, but nothing serious enough to keep her from marrying her now-husband, Sam Brown.

'It’s been the craziest montage of everything, it’s been really hard and
 it’s been stressful but we’re here and Marilyn made it and we’re 
married,' Sam Brown said.

The fire broke out in the apartment building about 1 a.m. on June 23. Within minutes, firefighters were on the scene battling the enormous flames and trying to rescue people trying to get out of the building.

Maid of honor: Kruc attended the wedding and walked down the aisle with the help of a walker and back brace

By the time the fire was under control, eight people had been injured by either the flames or from jumping from the building.

The roof and several apartments were completely gutted by the inferno, which authorities are now investigating as possible arson.

Eight of the apartment in the 24-unit building were completely destroyed, while ten others suffered smoke and water damage, Becky O'Guin, a spokeswoman with South Metro Fire Rescue Authority, told the Denver Post.

Of the injuries, Kruc's was the most serious - she suffered two broken vertebrae in her lower back and underwent surgery hours after the fire.

Both women were terrified.

Arson: Detectives are investigating the fire - that injured 8 and destroyed much of the building - as possible arson

'I just am glad I was with her in this moment because if we were to die,
 I was with my best friend,' Lenise Brown told 7NEWS shortly after the blaze.

The father of the bride, Greg Ruff, was happy to give his daughter away following the near-tragic incident.

'The toasts are a little higher.  I never had doubt the wedding wouldn't happen,' Ruff said.
