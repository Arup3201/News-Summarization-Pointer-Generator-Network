A teetotal mother-of-two is suing a novelty company after her high school graduation photo was used on a hip flask alongside the phrase: 'I'm going to be the most popular girl in rehab.'

Church-goer Veronica Vigil from Chimayó, New Mexico, has filed a lawsuit against Anne Taintor Inc. after they used the image taken in the 1970s without her permission. 

Her attorneys claim the product is defamatory as she does not consume alcohol or drugs and is an invasion of her privacy, according to court documents.

Angry: Church-goer Veronica Vigil from Chimayó, New Mexico, has filed a lawsuit against Anne Taintor Inc after they used a picture of her at her high school graduation from the 1970s on this  flask without permission

The complaint, obtained by the Santa Fe New Mexican, says: 'Given the seriousness of the issues of substance abuse in the community in which plaintiff resides, she has held herself out by reputation for her children and her community, to refrain from abuse or even use of alcohol and illicit drugs and has set an example that the issue is a very serious one that destroys families and lives.'

The document adds that the use of the image has lead some people to believe that she has a problem with substance abuse - causing her to be the subject of 'scorn and contempt'.

It is unknown what school she graduated from, but her lawyers claim it is either Española High School or Pojoaque High School. 

Mrs Vigil, who has two grown sons and runs an auto-repair shop with her husband in Chimayó, became aware of the flask when her daughter came across it while vacationing in Florida.

The product was not listed on Taintor’s website Friday, but it was being offered on Amazon for prices ranging from $21.95 to $25.29.

Case: She is suing Anne Taintor Inc (screenshot of website left), owned by the Havard University graduate (right), claiming the use of her picture is defamatory as she does not drink or do drugs 

Blair Dunn, Mrs Vigil's attorney said Doodlet’s - a Santa Fe toy store and gift shop that has been in business since 1955 -  is also named in the complaint because the store has sold the flask and  other Taintor.

They have claimed they should not be involved in the suit as they have never sold the flask with Mrs Vigil's face on it. 

Mr Dunn added that other New Mexico outlets, including Talin Market in Albuquerque and Costco, also have carried products with Vigil’s image 

The company was started by Havard University graduate Anne Taintor in 1985 with the motto: 'Making smart people smile.'

They create products including tea towels, mugs, calendars and phone cases with photos of women posing alongside sarcastic slogans.

'It’s okay, I didn’t want a real life anyway' and 'Make your own damn dinner' are among those that have been used. 

The suit charges Taintor with defamation, invasion of privacy and unfair trade practices, seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages.

For sale: The product was taken down from Anne Taintor's website, but was still listed on Amazon for $25
