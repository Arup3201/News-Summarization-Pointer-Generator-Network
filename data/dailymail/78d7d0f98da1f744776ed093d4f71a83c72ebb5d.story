Australian tech entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes has been forced to apologise after an employee said a software program was his girlfriend and listed some of her negative attributes.

Mr Cannon-Brookes rose to prominence after he co-founded Atlassian, a $3.5 billion enterprise software company that develops products for project managers and software developers, in 2002.

But after engineer Jonathan Doklovic described software program Maven as a 'demanding', 'complaining' and 'interupting' girlfriend, Mr Cannon-Brookes had to excuse his employee's comments, reported The Sydney Morning Herald.

Maven: The negative comments about the software program were made during a presentation by engineer Jonathan Doklovic in Berlin on Wednesday

The remarks were made by Mr Doklovic during a presentation at Atlassian's two-day developer conference in Berlin on Wednesday and have cast a shadow over Silicon Valley.

The 'demanding' software the engineer referred to is a program capable of standardising and simplifying projects built with software language Java.

In his power point presentation, Mr Doklovic, who was hired by Mr Cannon-Brookes, said the software looks beautiful, complains a lot, demands, interrupts me when I'm working and doesn't play well with my other friends.

He did not acknowledge that the Hebrew meaning of maven is someone who understands, based on accumulating knowledge and information.

But the comments proved controversial and have seen intense backlash on social media including Twitter and also from the media.

'We are sorry': Entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes, pictured, wrote an apology in response to his employee's comments

The outrage triggered Mr Cannon-Brookes to make a written apology entitled On failing our values, our team, and our industry, on Atlassian blogs.

'Today one of our engineers delivered a presentation that contained inappropriate content at our AtlasCamp developer conference,' Mr Cannon-Brookes wrote.

'We are sorry for having allowed this offensive slide into an AtlasCamp presentation. The content does not reflect our company values – nor our personal values as co-founders and individuals. Quite simply, it’s not OK.

'Sexism is a difficult issue for the tech industry, and today we didn’t make it any better.'

Mr Cannon-Brookes states that immediate action is being taken, but does not mention if Mr Doklovic will be fired for the incident.

He also defended the employee in question.

'I know the engineer responsible well. I hired him. I know the slide does not reflect his values any more than it reflects Atlassian’s, and he is as deeply sorry as we are. It was an error in judgment, but one the company shares responsibility for making.'

Backlash: People took to Twitter to express their anger of the comments

The apology goes onto to say Atlassian has failed as a team and together they will help the engineer learn from his mistake.

Mr Cannon-Brookes concludes by saying Atlassian has strived to create a diverse team environment.

'Clearly today we let ourselves, our team and our industry down. We’ll continue striving, growing and learning,' he finished.

The latest scandal is the first in a long line of sexist controversies, including a pitch by two Australians at last year's  TechCrunch start-up conference, where they outlined their idea for an app called 'Titstare', which 'takes photos of yourself staring at tits.

Just days later Business Insider chief technology officer Pax Dickinson was fired after he defended the actions of the two Australians.

Last month co-founder of GitHub, a coding website used by software developers globally, was forced to resign after he made errors of judgment in relation to accusations of sexual harassment by a female engineer who resigned.

Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel also apologised after offensive emails about women from his time at university surfaced.
