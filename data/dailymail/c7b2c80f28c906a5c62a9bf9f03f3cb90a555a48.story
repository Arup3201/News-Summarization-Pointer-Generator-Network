An Arizona mother accused of killing her daughter and of trying to poison her three other children on Christmas Day could face the death penalty.

A Pinal County Superior Court judge has approved postponing the deadline for the Pinal County Attorney's Office to file a seeking a death sentence against Connie Villa, The Casa Grande Dispatch reports.

According to court documents, the deadline was changed earlier this month from March 10 to May 9.

Deputy Pinal County Attorney Patrick Gard filed motions Feb. 5 seeking interviews with Connie Villa's mother and brother as material witnesses.

Prosecutors say 34-year-old Villa is charged with one count of first-degree murder in the death of her 13-year-old daughter and four counts of attempted murder of her three younger children and of her ex-husband.

Police say Villa tried to force her kids aged 13, 8, 5 and 3 to swallow prescription narcotics.

Adam Villa first called police to report that his crazed ex-wife Connie had attacked and stabbed him repeatedly in the torso after he went to pick up his children from her Casa Grande home.

Holiday horror: Connie Villa allegedly force-fed her four children narcotic drugs in an attempt to kill them on Christmas Day, killing her oldest. Villa's daughter Ania Rael Macias, 13 (left), was found dead in the bathroom by police who forced their way into the home Wednesday night

Mr.
 Villa arrived after he was lured there by his ex-wife, AZcentral.com 
reports. He called authorities as he drove himself to the hospital.

Police forced themselves into the 
home and found teenaged Ania Rael in the bathroom, suffocated to death.

Left
 behind were his three children, the younger surviving children, who 
were at their mother's side as she held a knife to her chest and bled 
from what looked to be self-inflicted stab wounds to her upper torso.

The children appeared unharmed. Tests later discovered traces of opiates in each of their systems.

Two of Villa’s children told cops their mother gave them doses of her prescription medicine, the Dispatch reports, but that Ania Rael refused to take the medicine.

Police say they found a suicide note from Villa, addressed to her mother Anita Salazar. Documents say the note 'stated words to the effect that Villa wanted to die and take her children with her.'

Police also reportedly found prescription drug bottles and an open wine bottle.

Shocking: Connie Villa's ex-husband and father of her youngest three children Adam Villa says he was lured to her home at The Colony apartments in Casa Grande (pictured), where she stabbed him and then began stabbing herself

Connie Villa was admitted to a Pheonix-area hospital, where she was treated for the stab wounds. The Dispatch reports that she is in the Pinal County Jail and is not allowed to post bond for release.

Meanwhile,
 Ania Rael's shocked family are left to wonder how and if a mother could 
commit such an atrocity and released this statement:

'On
 behalf of Michael Macias, Ania’s father, Vera Macias, Ania’s 
grandmother and extended family, we request that the focus of this 
tragedy be a celebration of our precious Ania’s life.

'She
 was a gentle, kind and beautiful spirit who was taken from us much too 
soon. Michael and his family are heartbroken. Ania was always smiling. 
She loved her brothers and sisters. She enjoyed spending time with her 
father and sister Gaby. 

'We
 are writing this statement in hopes that the media and other outlets 
will allow Michael and our family to grieve peacefully. We thank 
everyone for the outpouring of support for our family. We appreciate 
your prayers and positive thoughts. We pray that justice will be 
served.'
