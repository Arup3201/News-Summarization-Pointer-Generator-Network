The heartbroken girlfriend of a teenager who died from cancer after fulfilling his wish to take her to their school prom has told of their final hours together.

Jak Trueman, 15, passed away just two days after he took long-term girlfriend Hannah Boyd to West Calder High's prom in West Lothian, Scotland last week.

As friends and family paid tribute to the teenager's brave battle with cancer today, Hannah, 14, told how the young couple spent their final hours together.

Hannah told about their final hours together on Twitter, saying he was happy to be looking at her

She tweeted: 'Warms my heart that in Jak's final hours he said "All I can see is Hannah and it's making me happy"'

Shortly after his death, she wrote: 'Thank you for all the beautiful memories never to be forgotten, sweet dreams my boy'

More than £50,000 has now been donated to Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research through the Jak's Journey JustGiving page.

His mother, Allison Barr, told today of Jak's final wishes for a centre called Jak's Den for local children and ill youngsters to be opened in his memory.

She wrote: 'My precious boy always put others first and we want to ensure Jak's Den is a place where people come and feel welcome and at home and for a little while feel special courtesy of my beautiful boy.'

Jak wanted the centre to include counselling rooms, a sports area, a cafe and music room. 

Jak's final wish was to accompany Hannah, who he has been dating for almost two years, to the school event

Jak was diagnosed with T-Cell Lymphoma last year and was told last month that the disease had spread

Jak was diagnosed with T-Cell Lymphoma in August last year and was in line to take more treatment until scans showed early last week that the cancer had spread throughout his body. 

The 15-year-old keen footballer was applauded by tearful classmates at the school dance which was organised at the last minute after doctors told him he was dying last week.

The teenager's condition had deteriorated rapidly  and he needed pain relief to be able to attend his prom.

He could only stay for 10 minutes at the dance which was held at Livingston Football Club near his home in Mid Calder as he started to feel unwell.

After the event he wrote a message saying: 'I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again.

'I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving.

'Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along, even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile.'

At the prom his family collected his Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity.

His mother told of his death of Facebook yesterday, writing: 'Devastated and heartbroken to say my beautiful boy's gone to Heaven, God bless.

'Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever. Simply the best.' 

Jak's funeral be held next Tuesday at Kirk O Calder, Mid Calder. Mourners will wear Royal Blue and Rangers scarves in tribute to Jak's love of the Glasgow football club.

A charity football match - featuring former players from the famous team - will be held in Jak's honour on Sunday at Livingston FC Stadium.
