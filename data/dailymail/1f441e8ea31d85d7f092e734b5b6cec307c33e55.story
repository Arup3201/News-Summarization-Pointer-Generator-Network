A Romanian man cross-dressed to gain entry into jewellery shops as part of his gang's £300,000 robbery campaign.

After persuading shopkeepers to let him in, Vasile Bogdan, 35, was followed into the stores by his sledgehammer-wielding accomplices.

They smashed glass display cabinets before grabbing valuable gold items and fleeing the scene.

Before and after: Thief Vasile Bogdan cross-dressed as woman to help gang gain entry into jewellery shops 

The Romanian raider wore a black wig, skirt and fur hat and coat while he acted as a lookout.

Bogdan was today jailed for ten years after being caught by police during the gang’s fifth raid in January this year.

The bandit claimed he was a penniless jobseeker, but investigations revealed he had been travelling to and from his native Romania between raids.

Sentencing him at the Old Bailey, Judge Richard Marks QC said: ‘It very much looks as though these robberies were, so far as you were concerned, in the nature of a business trip.

‘It is very obvious you were able to fund these journeys backwards and forwards to Romania from your ill-gotten gains from your involvement in these robberies.

‘Moreover, I am driven to the conclusion that you came here for the express purpose of involving yourself in these robberies, which were unquestionably highly planned and carried out with determination and professionalism.’

Det Con Darren Guntrip, of the Met’s Flying Squad, compared Bogdan's cross-dressing role to that of Dustin Hoffman's 1980s comedy film character, Tootsie.

He said of Bogdan’s role in the robbery gang: ‘Tootsie would have been proud.’

The Eastern European gang targeted four Asian jewellery stores in east London between November 2012 and January this year.

Targeted: The gang first struck at Lakshmis Jewellers in High Street North, Manor Park

They first struck at Lakshmis 
Jewellers in High Street North, Manor Park, on November 25 and hit 
Lasani Jewellers in Plashet Grove, East Ham on December 4. 

A further raid followed at Satyan in Green Street, Upton Park, on December 22.

The gang also tried to rob Gold City in Stratford Road, Birmingham, but were foiled when the store’s smokescreen was activated.

Bogdan was arrested after the gang hit Kowaj Jewellers in Bethnal Green on January 25.

Bystander Mohammed Alim tipped off police after seeing him remove his wig before stepping into a coffee shop. He was arrested by police when he emerged minutes later.

Mr Alim was awarded £100 by the judge, who said: ‘Without this particular gentleman’s assistance and vigilance, unquestionably this defendant would not have been arrested.’

Up to ten other gang members are thought to be still at large.

Brereton Horne, defending, claimed Bogdan had only met the other men while looking for construction work and had yet to be paid for his part in the plot.

But the judge said he could not accept this when he had paid for flights home.

The court heard Bogdan also has four convictions for theft in his homeland, where he has served jail terms totaling seven years.

The judge said: ‘Although it is right to say that none of the shopkeepers were physically hurt or indeed threatened, I have little doubt that in the case of each of these offences the shopkeepers and other individuals in the stores must have been absolutely terrified by what they witnessed.

‘These were planned, professional robberies involving a significant degree of sophistication.’

Bogdan, who has no fixed address in the UK, admitted conspiracy to rob.
