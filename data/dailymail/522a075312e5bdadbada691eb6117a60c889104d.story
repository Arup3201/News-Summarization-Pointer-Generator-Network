A blast of winter will arrive next week as Arctic winds bring flurries of snow and widespread frosts to Britain.

Forecasters are warning families to brace themselves for the coldest weather of the season – but not before further threats of flooding.

Wet and windy weather tonight could cause problems along the Norfolk and Suffolk coast.

The Environment Agency said there was an increased likelihood of flooding across England this winter because a wet October has left the ground saturated in many parts, increasing the risk of run-off.

But
 the wet and mild weather  will be blown away next week,  says Chris 
Burton from forecasters Meteogroup. By Tuesday, daytime temperatures 
could be as low as  3C (37f) in parts of the country,  and overnight the
 mercury could hit freezing.

‘This
 weekend, temperatures  will remain fairly mild for much of the country,
 with frosts and chilly conditions for those further north,’ he said.‘As we move into Monday the winds are going to swing round, bringing in much colder conditions from the north.

‘It
 will be the coldest spell  of weather we will have had this side of 
summer. Widespread frosts will be likely with temperatures below zero in
 parts. It will feel  wintry, with snow further north and on higher 
ground.’

Forecasters said next week’s  drop in temperatures will feel  especially cold following such a mild autumn.

Met
 Office spokesman Laura Young said: ‘Into the beginning of next week 
there are some colder conditions spreading down from the North West. 
It’s been so mild but we are in the middle of November now, so we 
haven’t had a bad run of it.’

There
 is likely to be frost in many areas tomorrow morning, with an added 
risk of fog for drivers and by Saturday a band of wet weather moving in 
from the Atlantic will bring showers for many.

‘On
 Saturday it’s another cold start, particularly in the East and South 
East,’ said Miss Young. ‘Quite a bit of the North will see rain and 
maximum temperatures will be near normal, but it will feel a little bit 
colder in the wind.’

She added that on Sunday  there will also be the risk of snow on high ground.

According
 to the Local Government Association, councils across England and Wales 
have been replenishing and adding to 1.3 million tons of grit stockpiled
 in preparation for wintry weather.

Thousands of pounds’ worth of damage was caused to properties by what residents are calling a freak ‘tornado’ that ripped through coastal villages.

Outbuildings were destroyed in Trevone, and roofs of houses were damaged in Harlyn Bay and Constantine Bay, all in Cornwall.

A terrified couple out walking their dog at 7.30am on Saturday morning in Trevone ran to take shelter in a ditch as debris flew towards them.

Another resident of the village, Kay Browning, found her chicken shed had been upended and landed on a road, killing one of her chickens.

She said: ‘There was a terrifying noise like a low-flying jet, and planks of wood and other debris started to shoot over our heads. It was quite terrifying.

‘We jumped into a ditch to take shelter. We could hear things crashing and smashing, which we later realised were greenhouses being damaged.'

Richard Trenough, who owns a farm, found two of his metal cattle feeders had been lifted into the air - one ending up 150 yards away in another field.

Unsure: A spokesman for the Met Office said it could not verify whether it was a tornado that had struck the three villages in Cornwall

Blown down: Mr Trenough, whose damaged farm is pictured said it was a 'once-in-a-lifetime event, and I'll never see the like again'

He said: ‘I’m calling it a tornado because it cut such a narrow swathe through the village. My cattle feeders just seemed to take off.

‘The polytunnel has survived gale after gale for over 20 years, but not the tornado. It was a once-in-a-lifetime event, and I’ll never see the like again.’

A Met Office spokesman said: ‘To be a tornado, it has to have a destructive funnel cloud that touches the ground. We have around 30 a year in the UK.

‘To verify whether it was a tornado, we either need photos, or for it to be picked up by our weather station at Cardinham, but nothing was registered.’
