Well, it had to be said. And it had to be said with some force by a figure of some power within English football.

Greg Dyke had been turning the speech over in his head for two months, from the day he replaced David Bernstein as chairman of the Football Association.

On Wednesday, high above London, on the 29th floor of Millbank Tower, he got it off his chest.

Urgent changes: Greg Dyke highlighted all the areas where English football needs to be improved

English football is accelerating towards a great crash, Dyke warned, and the statistics are irrefutable. The Barclays Premier League is largely foreign and almost £500million was paid by English clubs to foreign clubs for foreign players during the transfer window which closed on Monday.

The England team is under clear threat, he explained, but it went far beyond that.

‘In short,’ said Dyke. ‘We all have a responsibility to do our best to reverse this frightening trend because if we fail we will be letting English football down and we will be letting the nation down.’

Others inside the FA had been longing for this moment, too; longing to hear someone acknowledge the impending crisis rather than pussyfooting around, desperate not to offend a club from whom they might soon be begging a favour.

Dyke was perfectly happy to enhance his reputation as a straight talking, no-nonsense leader, a bit of a geezer, while taking care to stress he was not offering the Premier League outside for a fight.

State of the nation: Dyke admits the Premier League has become 'a finishing school for overseas talent'

Whether it was wise to target World Cup glory in the Qatari desert in nine years’ time is another matter. A mirage, surely, but the 66-year-old FA chairman will be long gone by then, removed by the same age restriction that unseated Bernstein in July once he turned 70.

Dyke’s nine-year plan will have at least another five years to run when he is too old for office, perhaps a reason for not wasting time.

So, as Roy Hodgson prepared his team for Friday’s important World Cup qualifier against Moldova at Wembley, Dyke defined what a successful England team means to the nation.

‘Television ratings show this quite clearly,’ said the former BBC director general. ‘Club matches occasionally get audiences in excess of 10million when teams are playing an important match on free-to-air television.

‘But when England are playing in the finals of the World Cup or the European Championship, as many as 20million people watch a game.’

True, but many staunch fans put club before country and 10 per cent of the Premier League’s 20 members are from Wales. What do they care about the England team?

Leadership quality: Jack Wilshere will be a key figure in the next decade of the national team

Dyke will form an FA commission to scrutinise all this and invite the chairmen from the Premier League, the Football League, the League Managers Association and the Professional Footballers’ Association on board.

Upon hearing this, the Premier League noted that their participation would be down to their shareholders, the 20 clubs, to decide, which could happen at a meeting on Thursday. If not, in November.

Just a hint of the logistical difficulties associated with bringing football’s powerbrokers together. Only last year, the Premier League cajoled everyone together to back their Elite Player Performance Plan, dedicated  to producing ‘more and better’ home- grown players.

Memorable past: Dyke is hoping England can repeat their 1966 World Cup success in 2022

They are investing £340m into this youth development scheme over four years, starting last year, and are not likely to let Dyke distract them.

Player development is at the heart of the argument. Many of the issues would vanish if English clubs churned out hi-tech young footballers and were devoted to promoting them into the first team.

As it is, foreign teenagers are targeted by clubs as they strive for better academy  graduates. This is one of the things top clubs hope the EPPP will offset.

Amid Dyke’s blizzard of stats, a striking one was that only 35 English players Under 21 appeared in the Premier League last season, and he appealed to the nation, not as football fans, but as parents.

‘We will be letting down generations 
of English kids who might otherwise have made it at the top level in 
football but weren’t given the chance,’ he said.

The
FA must shoulder their portion of the blame on youth development and 
the  chairman sensibly accepted his own organisation must raise their 
game, not simply complain that the world is against them.

Dyke
also confronted his role in the formation of the Premier League as the 
managing director of London Weekend Television, present at a dinner in 
1990 which proved the origin of the breakaway which shaped modern 
football in this country.

‘What
none of us at that dinner could have foreseen,’ he said, ‘was that 
because of the very success of the Premier League, 20 years later we 
would end up with a league largely owned by foreign owners, managed by 
foreign managers and played by foreign players and that, as a result, it
could be argued that the England set-up has been weakened, rather than 
strengthened, by the creation of the Premier League.

‘I
am not being xenophobic but my job is to help ensure that English 
football — and particularly the England team — is in a healthy state.’

And it is not. One glance at this qualifying campaign will support that.

‘Personally I think the situation is serious, very serious,’ said Dyke. ‘But saying that  is easy.’

Indeed it is. Still, it had to be said. And he’s got it off his chest. It is what happens next that really matters.
