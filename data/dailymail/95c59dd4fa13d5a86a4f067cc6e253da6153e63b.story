A man was pulled over while test-driving a BMW and arrested by police.

Jon-Christopher Sowells was trying out the car from the Philip Motors dealership in Snellville, Georgia, when police stopped him.

After refusing to get out of the car, Sowells was dragged out by police, confronted with Tasers and arrested for obstruction. Despite the dramatic test drive, the man still bought the BMW.

According to Channel 2, Sowells was unsure why he had been stopped. 

He said: ‘[The policeman] said "You don’t have any tags on the car". I said “No problem, I don’t have any tags on this car because it’s not my car”.’

Sowells told the police that if they called the dealer, he would confirm Sowells' story but officers asked to see paperwork which was sitting on the back seat of the car.

Unsure what the paperwork was for, Sowells refused to hand it over.

Sowells said: ‘They asked me to get 
out of the car. I said “I don’t feel comfortable”. They commenced to 
open up the car door and they tried to drag me out of the door by my 
left arm.

‘They’re treating me like I’m a criminal and I hadn’t done anything.’

The police then reportedly confronted the man with Tasers and he was arrested.

A
statement from Snellville police of the incident in May this year read:
‘The officer observed a paper on the rear seat that appeared to be of 
the type dealers use when placing a vehicle for sale.

‘He asked if he could retrieve it and Mr Sowells refused. Based on his refusal to provide information and his passive and then active resistance, Mr Sowells was charged with obstruction.’

After the dealer could not be reached on the telephone, an officer drove to the dealership to confirm Sowells’ story.

Sowells said: ‘The dealer comes out to pick the car up and at this point, I'm thinking we can all go home everything is OK now. No it's not OK, I'm going to jail.’

On another dramatic test drive, an unidentified man was test driving a Lamborghini Aventador worth £241,000 last year when it burst into flames. He was able to get out of the car before the fire spread and he was joined by fellow spectators who watched on as the fire department tended to the burning mass on a southern California highway.
