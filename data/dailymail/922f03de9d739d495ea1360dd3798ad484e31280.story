Allison Baden-Clay’s loving traits are well and truly living on in her three beautiful daughters, her sister has revealed.

Vanessa Fowler said her nieces - now aged 13, 10 and 7 - are seeing a counsellor and rebuilding their lives without either of their parents, as she spoke to The Sunday Mail for the first time since Gerard Baden-Clay was found guilty of murdering his wife last month.

Ms Fowler said their mother would be proudly looking down on all three girls as they are settling into their new school, making friends and doing ‘what normal kids do’.

The eldest child takes after her mother by excelling in ballet and the middle daughter is in a leadership role in her class, while the youngest is flourishing at primary school.

'They are doing things that Allison would be looking down on them — she’s proud,' Ms Fowler said.

She added that as the past could not be changed the family can only provide a nurturing environment for the girls just as their mother had done in their young lives.

‘They talk about her, they are working with their counsellor so hopefully in the long run they will be able to know the situation.’

‘I don’t think they really comprehend it at the moment,' she said.

‘We’re guided by the counsellor and he deals with a lot of their questions and that’s all confidential between them.’

Former real estate agent, Baden-Clay, 43, denied murdering his wife, Allison, 43, who he had reported missing on April 20, 2012.

Her body was found dumped in a creek 10 days later and Baden-Clay always maintained she was attacked or fell while out for a walk.

During his trial at the Brisbane Supreme Court, the jury heard about Baden-Clay's numerous affairs and financial worries - enough of a motive for murder.

The jury found him guilty of the cold-blooded killing and a judge sentenced him to life behind bars.

‘We were pleased with the outcome but it’s not going to bring Allison back. At least we have some justice,’ she said.

Ms Fowler said the three girls could not yet comprehend the tragic situation but would learn to over time

Ms Fowler spoke about Allison’s parents Geoff and Priscilla Dickie taking on the role as the primary carers for their grandchildren and that the couple wouldn’t have it any other way.

‘The girls come first. They will do anything and everything for the three girls.’

She also mentioned that they still have contact with their other grandparents.

Ms Fowler described her sister as generous and caring with everyone she met which has been instilled in her children.

'She put herself last and put everybody else first. She did everything she could for anybody else.’

She admitted the family still had a long journey ahead of them which included fulfilling her sister’s desire to give her daughters the best education possible.

‘She will think they are on track right now,’ she said.

‘She will think they are prospering, doing so well. I think she would be really pleased.’

Ms Fowler said the children had a long road ahead of them without either of their parents (pictured) but the family will remain by their side for constant loving support
