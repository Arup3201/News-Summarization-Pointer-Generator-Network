A 23-year-old waiter is experiencing a slice of the celebrity lifestyle thanks to his resemblance to One Direction heartthrob Harry Styles.

Nathan Land, from Walsall in the West Midlands, is stopped by groups of girls on a daily basis. They  are all after the holy grail for One Direction fans: a selfie with Harry.

Nathan said: 'I am always stopped when I am out and about, with people asking me for a photo.

'Younger fans get really excited and I 
can see them tapping their mum of the shoulder and asking if they can 
have a pictures with Harry. I think it is quite funny.'

Nathan Land works part time as a waiter and says he doesn't cultivate his similar appearance to Harry Styles at all

Even just walking down the street can prove problematic for Nathan who is stopped by groups of girls on a daily basis, who are all after the holy grail for One Direction fans- a selfie with Harry

Nathan insists he doesn’t try to look like Harry, although he does like to wear white T-shirts and, on occasion, skinny jeans just like the stylish mega star.

Nathan said: 'I have naturally curly hair which is Harry’s most famous feature - some people think I have had a perm, but it is all real.'

The part-time waiter is often asked to make appearances at children’s birthday parties.

And Nathan was once given a £20 tip for serenading one of his customer’s daughters with the One Direction song, ‘One way or another’.

The part-time waiter is hoping to increase the amount of lookalike work he does

Nathan said: 'She really wanted to surprise her daughter, so she tipped me so I would sing to her - it was really cringey but I still did it and the girl loved it.'

But it’s not all adoring fans - the Harry lookalike has said he has had men pick fights with him on nights out.

Nathan said: 'A lot of guys hate Harry Styles because their girlfriends like him, so I have had the odd punch thrown at me - but it’s just part and parcel of it.'

Nathan admits that looking like Harry Styles does help him attract the opposite sex, although it’s not always worked to his advantage.

While the ladies may like his similarity to the star, Nathan says men are less complimentary, and he has even been hit on nights out

Nathan said: 'I was with a girl in Starbucks one time, and everything was going well. Then a middle-aged man who was on his own came over and told me he was having a selfie with me.

'He pushed the camera in front of us, took the pictures and then walked off laughing. It wasn’t the best timing.'

The Harry doppelganger enjoys the perks of looking like the megastar and is now hoping to do more professional lookalike work.

Nathan said: 'If I can get the work, I would be happy to make more appearances.'

There's only one drawback: Nathan admits he isn’t the biggest fan of the band.

He said: 'They remind me of summer because their songs always come out then, I’m not a massive fan but I don’t have anything against the band.

'My life has got better because of them, so I can’t really complain.'
