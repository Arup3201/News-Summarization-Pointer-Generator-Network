Chris Beardshaw (pictured) told listeners that a diet of Black Sabbath was best for plants

Talking to your plants is supposed to be good for them.

But if you really want the best blooms, you should blast them with heavy metal music.  

That’s the unlikely finding of a study by horticultural students who tested the effects of music on plants.

And although the plants themselves 
were shorter, they were more disease-resistant.

He
said: ‘We had one greenhouse that was silent and we had one that was 
played classical music, one that was played Cliff Richard and one that 
was played Black Sabbath.

‘The ones with Black Sabbath – great big, thumping noise, rowdy music – they were the shortest, but they had the best flowers and the best resistance to pest and disease.

“It was alstroemerias we were growing and we bombarded these glasshouses with sound for the life of the plant.”

‘Those in the Cliff Richard house all died. Sabotage was suspected but we couldn’t prove it,’ he said.
