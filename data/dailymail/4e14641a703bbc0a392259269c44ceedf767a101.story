Prominent economist Jeremy Lawson has warned that the Australian housing market is overvalued

The Australian housing market is  between 20 to 30 percent overvalued, leaving Australia open to an international economic shock, warns a leading senior Australian economic expert.

The overvaluation of the property market is fuelled by policies that make getting large home loans too easy, leading Australian economist Jeremy Lawson said.

Mr Lawson is the global chief economist of British fund manager Standard Life and a former senior economist at the Reserve Bank of Australia and the OECD and adviser to former prime minister, Kevin Rudd.

'Overall financial conditions have probably been too loose and that has undermined longer-run financial stability,' he said in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.

He stated that the boom in the property market is the result of increased money supply through easy monetary policy and a reluctance of institutions to implement macro-prudential tools, which aim to mitigate risk for the financial system as a whole, which was broadly considered necessary in the wake of the global financial crisis.

Daily Mail Australia reported on Friday that there are now 417 suburbs in Australia with an average price of more than $1 million, a rise of 33 per cent in just one year.

Mr Lawson also said there had been too much of a focus on credit growth, as the RBA has repeatedly stated increases of over six percent per year is not a matter of concern. Instead he said the RBA should focus on the ratio of household debt-to-income, which has increased to over 150 percent, which is just slightly lower than just before the 2007 financial crisis.

'A high debt-to-income ratio leaves households much more vulnerable to income and interest rate shocks,' he said.

Mr Lawson warned that the Australian economy was too closely connected to Chinese trade and if China were to experience a sharp downturn, the Australian economy would suffer substantially.

'The painful choices governments will need to make at that time will make the ruckus over the May budget look like a minor skirmish,' he said.

He also warned that while Australian debt metrics were good, Australia's structural fiscal position has deteriorated significantly over the last ten years and meaning Australia is 'very vulnerable to the next big global shock,' which he said could come about due to the breakdown of the relationship between the West and Russia.
