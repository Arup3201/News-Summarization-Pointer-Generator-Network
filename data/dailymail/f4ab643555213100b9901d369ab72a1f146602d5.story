Police have found a backpack belonging to an Iowa 15-year-old who has been missing since Monday, as search teams continue to hunt air, land and sea for the teen.

Kathlynn Shepard's family are praying the piece of evidence leads to their daughter who investigators believe was abducted with a 12-year-old friend by registered sex offender, Michael J. Klunder, 42, shortly after getting off their school bus in Dayton.

The friend escaped from a hog confinement facility some miles from where she said the pair accepted a ride from Klunder, who was found dead of suicide in his home just four hours after picking up the girls.

Late on Tuesday, officers found two backpacks and a purse belonging to the girls. Investigators have also released an image showing Kathlynn just
minutes before the abduction, as she disembarked the school bus wearing
a Cubs baseball cap and a grey t-shirt with an American flag on it.

The bags were found by K9 teams in Fraser, some 15-miles south of where the girls were taken, next to a wooded state park.

The 12-year-old girl has not been identified. Police say she escaped from a hog confinement facility several miles southeast of Dayton.

Officials said in a statement that the discovery of the backpacks have given police a new area to focus their search.

Iowa Department of 
Natural Resources has been searching the Des Moines river in boats, said
Bill Kietzman, an Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation special 
agent.

Police
are searching several areas within 20 miles of Dayton on foot and are 
using an Iowa State Patrol airplane equipped with a heat sensor.

Meanwhile the devastated family released a statement thanking volunteers who rushed to help search for the girl.

'We would like to thank everybody who took the time from their busy lives to help search for Kathlynn,' they said in a statement.

'To see so much love in our community and the surrounding areas is amazing. Thank you for all of your prayers and we hope to have Kathlynn home soon.

'We know that members of the public and media want to talk to us. Please understand, the idea of doing an interview is too overwhelming right now. Until Kathlynn is found, we'll remain focused on our family and ask that any requests for information or comment be directed to the DCI.'

On Tuesday, it was revealed Klunder had taken his own life amidst the massive
search for Kathlynn.

Kietzman said on Tuesday that the body
of the 42-year-old suspect was found on Monday night with a red Toyota
Tundra pickup at a rural property northeast of Dayton.

Kietzman said authorities have begun focusing their search
for Kathlynn to locations within 20 miles of Dayton, including Klunder's
residence.

Previously, the search covered up to 100 square miles of
mostly rural areas.

Authorities have also coordinated with the FBI to update
electronic billboards around the state with information about the search.

Kietzman would not elaborate on the likelihood of finding
Kathlynn alive, though he remained optimistic.

'Time obviously is not your friend in these kinds of
situations,' he said at a news conference. 'Our plan is that we're going to
find her alive. That's our hope.'

The 12-year-old girl told
investigators she and Kathlynn were taken to an agricultural facility. But she
was able to escape a short time later and ran to a rural residence for help,
Kietzman said. She was then taken to a Fort Dodge hospital and released.

The abduction spanned several hours, officials said, with
Klunder's body being discovered nearly four hours after the girls were taken.

Kathlynn is described as being 5-feet-6-inches and 160
pounds. She has blond hair, blue eyes and braces. She was last seen wearing
jeans, a gray hooded sweatshirt and a Minnesota Vikings baseball cap.

'The response by volunteers has been outstanding,' said DCI
Director Charis Paulson.

Jessica Lown with the Iowa Department of Public Safety said
authorities have been in contact with Kathlynn's family and they have declined
to comment.

'They're continuing to search for the girl under the
assumption that she is still alive because right at this point in time we don't
have information indicating otherwise,' Lown said. 'That's the way these things
work for all missing children and missing person cases. We search until we find
them.'

Klunder is listed on the state's sex offender registry,
prison records show. He spent several years in prison after being convicted on
kidnapping and assault charges, including the 1991 abduction and assault of a
Rudd woman and the kidnapping of two toddlers from an apartment complex in
Charles City, according to the Mason City Globe Gazette. The girls, both 3,
were found alive inside a dumpster.

He was released from a work release program in February
2011.

The abduction comes less than a year after the high-profile
disappearance of two cousins in Evansdale, about 90 miles east of Dayton. Lyric
Cook, 10, and 8-year-old Elizabeth Collins disappeared while riding their bikes
last July. Hunters found their bodies in a remote, wooded area in December.

Evansdale Police Chief Kent Smock said investigators were
looking into whether Klunder was involved in Lyric and Elizabeth's kidnappings
and deaths. DCI and FBI agents who have been involved in the search for the
Evansdale girls have been dispatched to help search for Kathlynn.

Smock said investigators were trying to determine whether
Klunder had any ties to the area.

'There's a multitude of things we're looking at to determine
whether he may be a person of interest or not a person of interest,' he said. 'It's
much too early in their investigation to be able to say with any degree of
accuracy one way or another whether it's related to our case at all.'

Authorities are asking the public for information about any
interactions with Klunder, as well of any sighting of his pickup between 3 p.m.
and 8 p.m. Monday.
