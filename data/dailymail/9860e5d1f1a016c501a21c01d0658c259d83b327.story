It seems that fans of the Great British Bake Off don’t just care about the cake – they’re sticklers for hygiene too.

As the hit show returned to our screens this week, viewers took to Twitter to complain about the unruly hair of some contestants.

An average audience of 7.2million watched on Wednesday night – a record for an opening episode of the show, and an increase of 600,000 on the first programme in last year’s series.

Hairy baker: Iain Watters sports a thick beard which worried some users of microblogging site Twitter

Ready to bake: Judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry are back for Great British Bake Off's fifth series

Can they stand the heat? This year's GBBO contestants include the show's youngest and oldest ever bakers

But many were perturbed by two unshaven competitors who were branded ‘unhygienic’.

Construction engineer Iain Watters, 31, was criticised for his thick beard, while IT manager Jordan Cox, 33, was singled out for his long, wavy hair and stubble.

Viewer Holly Archer tweeted: ‘Can’t stand these beards and unwashed hair on Bake Off. No. You can’t cook if you ain’t got your hygiene sorted. Get out.’

Adam Flanagan added: ‘Surely that Bake Off beard is against hygiene rules?’

Another fan, writing under the name Bhu, said: ‘Wish the British Bake Off would enforce to the correct hygiene rules in relation to hair, jewellery and clothing, there’s hair everywhere.’

And Romford Stu said: ‘Wish that bloke would shave that beard. It’s disgusting. Not to mention unhygienic for a cooking show.’

Chef and hygiene expert Samuel Turner, who runs food safety consultancy Catersafe, said beards were ‘frowned upon’ in the industry.

‘Not only is there a greater risk of physical contamination from hairs that drop down into what you are preparing, beards also give off the wrong impression to those who are about to eat the food,’ he said. 

‘They look untidy, and if you can’t maintain a tidy appearance you are unlikely to produce nice-looking food. Most restaurants or supermarkets insist their chefs are either clean shaven or wear a covering over their beards.

‘The Bake Off is sending out the wrong message by allowing its contestants to cook in that state.’ 

Not all viewers objected to the facial hair, however. Some said Mr Watters’ beard was ‘lovely’ and ‘formidable’, and he quickly built up a following of female fans.

Many have hailed this series, the fifth, as the most diverse yet with the youngest-ever contestant, 17-year-old schoolgirl Martha, and the oldest, Diana, 69. Meanwhile fashion designer Chetna Makan, 35, is from India, and moved to the UK in 2003 and Enwezor Nzegwu, 39, was raised in North London but is half-Nigerian and half-Japanese. Luis Troyano, 42, was raised in Cheshire by Spanish parents.

A viewer writing under the name Alice, tweeted: ‘I love the diversity on the Great British Bake Off. Goes to show that anyone can bake.’

Happy tweet: GBBO judge Paul Hollywood was told about the 7.9million viewers today - and tweeted his thanks

As Bake Off contestants struggled to recreate Mary Berry’s cherry cake in the first technical challenge of the new series, viewers rushed to buy the same cake tin used on the show.

In a remarkable sign of the impact of the popular TV cook, online retailer Amazon reported that sales of a similar tin, the Master Class non-stick round fluted cake pan, rose by 1,003 per cent as the show was being broadcast.

Budding bakers also ordered 54 per cent more hand and stand mixers during the hour-long show compared to the same time last week. And sales of general bakeware, such as sieves and spatulas, rose by 43 per cent on the week before.

'Have we bitten off more than we can choux?'  Hilarious BBC Twitter exchange

The night before the show launched, GBBO fans who had one eye on Twitter enjoyed a jokey exchange between the Twitter accounts for BBC2, the show's former home, and BBC1.

First the @BBCTwo account tweeted: 'Goodbye, Great British Bake Off.  Have a great time on @BBCOne.  Never forget where you came from.'

Tweet that started it: First the @BBCTwo account tweeted this message the night before GBBO started

To which the @BBCOne account replied: 'Bless you, Two.  We hope we haven't bitten off more than we can choux.'

BBC2 shot back with: 'It's OK, One.  You're bready for this.'

And a steady stream of baking-related puns ensued.
