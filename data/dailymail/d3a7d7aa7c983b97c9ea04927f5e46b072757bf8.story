Some 22 people were shot over a 12 hour period in Chicago on Friday night, among them an 11-year-old who was killed by a stray bullet.

Shamiya Adams was making smores at a sleepover in Garfield Park - part of the city's troubled West Side neighborhood - about 9.30pm when she was shot in the head.

The bullet is believed to have come through the bedroom window of the first floor apartment where she was staying in the 3900 block of West Gladys Avenue.

Adams was rushed to Mount Sinair Hospital in a critical condition.

Her family staged a vigil by her bed throughout the night, but she was pronounced dead early Saturday, according to The Chicago Tribune.

Scene: The shooting occurred here, at the 3900 block of West Gladys Avenue in the Garfield Park  neighborhood of Chicago. There were 22 shootings in the West Side area on Friday night

'We do need these individuals (responsible) and we need them in custody as soon as possible,' community activist Andrew Holmes said.

Earlier, a 12-year-old girl was among three shot in the same neighborhood around 3.30 pm, police said, according to NBC.

However that girl survived.

The shooting happened in the 700 block of North Ridgeway Avenue.

The girl, along with a 33-year-old woman and a 44-year-old man, were shot when someone approached them on foot and opened fire.

The woman was shot in the face.

The girl and the woman were taken in stable condition to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County.

The man suffered a graze wound to the calf and was treated at the scene, police said.

In the Austin neighborhood about 3am a man was found dead in the front seat of a car in an alley next to Laramie Avenue.

He had been shot in the neck, back and shoulder.

A 15-year-old boy was also shot while sitting in a car about 12.50am in the 7000 block of South Winchester Avenue.

There were over a dozen more shootings in the same area on the night.
