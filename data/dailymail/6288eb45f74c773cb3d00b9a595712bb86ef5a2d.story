The inventor of the world's first electronic breathalyser machine has died at the age of 77.

Dr Tom Parry Jones revolutionised road safety after he came up with the invention which has caught millions of drink drivers worldwide.

The scientist invented the electronic device in 1974 and went on to manufacture and sell it to police forces across the world.

Dr Tom Parry Jones invented the world's first electronic breathalyser in 1974 and was later awarded an OBE for his contribution to improving road safety

He was later given an OBE for his contribution to the improvement of road safety.

At the time he 
said: 'I found inventing the device the easy part but producing it, 
developing it, and selling it was the challenge.'

Last night friends and family were in mourning after he died at his home in Anglesey, north Wales.

Dr Jones designed the device which is able to electronically scan blood alcohol level based on a breath sample.

Until then police asked drivers to walk a straight line or use a crude blow in a bag chemical system.

Dr Jones established Lion Laboratories to manufacture and market the products internationally.

In 1991 the entrepreneur sold his business to the American technology giant MPD, Inc.

He then went on to establish toxic gas detection company PPM Technology based in north Wales, Caernarfon, Wales

He was a fellow of Bangor University and he established a fund to encourage young people to pursue careers in science and technology.

The Dr Tom Parry Jones Fund is currently used to stage the annual Bangor Science Festival.

Dr Tom Parry Jones invented the electronic breathalyser in 1974.

He went on to manufacture and sell it to police forces across the world and significantly contributed to road safety.

Speaking to the BBC in 2003 Dr Jones 
said: 'I found inventing the device the easy part but producing it, 
developing it, and selling it was the challenge.'

The device is able to electronically scan blood alcohol level based on a breath sample.

Alcohol that a person drinks shows up in the breath because it gets absorbed from the mouth, throat, stomach and intestines into the bloodstream.

Because the alcohol concentration in the breath is related to that in the blood, a figure determining the amount of alcohol consumed can be determined by measuring alcohol on the breath.

The ratio of breath alcohol to blood alcohol is 2,100: 1. This means that 2,100 ml of air will contain the same amount of alcohol as 1 ml of blood.

The breathalyser uses a chemical reaction involving alcohol that produces a colour change.

Each device has a mouthpiece, a tube that the suspect blows air through, and a sample chamber where the air goes.

It contains two glass vials containing the chemical reaction mixture, a system of photocells connected to a meter to measure the colour change and a system to sample the breath.

The device works by a suspect breathing into it and the sample being bubbled in one vial through a mixture of sulfuric acid, potassium dichromate, silver nitrate and water.

Until its invention police asked drivers to walk a straight line or use a crude blow in a bag chemical system.
