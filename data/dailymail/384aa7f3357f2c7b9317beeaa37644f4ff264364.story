Just when Bali-bound Australians didn't think it could be possible to get a cheaper holiday - Indonesia is considering lifting its $US35 tourist visa fee on arrival from next year.

With one million Aussies expected to visit Bali this year alone - the news will be welcomed with open arms. 

It should come as no surprise that the land Down Under is touted as one of Indonesia's main foreign tourist targets - as Bali is the number one holiday spot for Australians.

Number one holiday spot: One million Aussies are expected to visit Bali this year alone

Aussies may be able to visit Bali for free from now 

The $US35 fee could be scrapped for citizens of Australia, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia from next year, Tourism Minister Arief Yahya says.

'Those countries are our main foreign tourist targets,' he told reporters on Wednesday, as reported by Indonesian news website detik.com.

'Like China, its middle-class is huge and that has potential for us.'

The free short-term visas for Indonesia's five main tourist markets was one idea to come out of a ministerial meeting on Wednesday.

Another option was simplifying licenses to encourage more yachts and cruise ships to stop over in Indonesia.

Indonesia - and in particular Bali - is one of Australia's top international holiday choices as more than 900,000 Australian visitors each year.

Australia contributed nearly 25 per cent of arrivals to the popular Indonesian island between January and September last year, according to a  poll conducted in January by UMR Research.

One in five - or 21 per cent - of the 500 Australians who particpated in the study had travelled to Bali.
