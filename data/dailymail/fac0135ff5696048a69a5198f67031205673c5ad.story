Miller reportedly asked a student for the cell phone number of a classmate and then sent text messages to the teen, according to court documents cited in the Chicago Sun-Times. 

During a hearing on Friday, a judge ordered her bond set at $150,000. A call to Miller's address was not immediately returned.

Miller lives on the city's West Side and has three children, according to ABC7.

On the school's website, Miller is described as a medical technology teacher. She is due back in court on August 29.

The Chicago Vocational Career Academy focuses on providing students with 'real work' opportunities which will help them zone in on their chosen field of study.
