After being named ‘star baker’ a record five times, Richard Burr was the hot favourite to win the Great British Bake Off.

So the judges’ decision to hand the crown to Nancy Birtwhistle instead has left a rather sour taste in the mouths of his fans.

Viewers took to Twitter in their droves to complain that 38-year-old Burr was ‘robbed’ after Mrs Birtwhistle was made the winner.

More viewers watched the climax of the Great British Bake Off than the World Cup final in the summer with 13.3 million fans tuning in to watch Nancy Birtwhistle  beat competition from Luis Troyano (left) and bookies' favourite Richard Burr (right)

A record 12.3million watched the grandmother of eight take the title on BBC1 on Wednesday night – nearly four million more than tuned in to last year’s final. 

Despite being aired in the middle of the week, it also beat last year’s Saturday night Strictly Come Dancing and X Factor finals. 

But not all of those watching were happy with what they saw.

While builder Mr Burr was gracious in defeat – offering his congratulations to Mrs Birtwhistle, 60, and describing her as a ‘brilliant baker and great friend’ – his fans were not so forgiving. 

Writing on Twitter, James Dunny said: ‘Richard was robbed. Nancy was the best in the final but Richard is the best baker overall.’

Elaine Day added: ‘GBBO got it wrong! Richard was so good all along … I like continuous assessment!’

Matt Davies said: ‘Richard robbed on #GBBO. What’s the point of being the best almost every week and that being discounted.’ And Luke Proudfoot wrote: ‘Nancy didn’t deserve to win at all. Richard has performed much better over the entire series.’ Michelle Hall added to the complaints, saying: ‘Rubbish! Can’t be good just one week then win. Richard was robbed!’

 While 12.1 million people tuned into BBC One to see Germany beat Argentina 1-0 in Brazil in July, more than one million more viewers watched the same channel on Wednesday night to see Nancy trounce bookies' favourite, builder Richard

Fans of the builder poointed out that the grandmother had been named 'star baker' in only one week of the series - during the first heat - whereas he took the title five times during the series

The shaven-headed family man was gracious in defeat, saying after the finale: 'Congratulations to Nancy. A brilliant baker, and a great friend. Hope I gave you a run for your money nance!!'

Many viewers who had been expecting Burr - known for his signature pencil tucked behind the ear - to be the victor after his many strong performances.

Fan Martin Colme tweeted: 'Someone phone watchdog and report a crime, Richard was robbed on the the #GBBOfinal #MaryBerryOut #JusticeForRichard' while fellow user James Dunny added: 'Richard was robbed. Nancy was the best in the final but Richard is the best baker overall. #GBBOfinal #GBBO'

But the shaven-headed family man was gracious in defeat, saying after the finale: 'Congratulations to Nancy. A brilliant baker, and a great friend. Hope I gave you a run for your money nance!!'

Birtwhistle said she was so caught up in the moment, she can now barely recall the actual triumph: 'The judges said my name, and I can't really remember what happened.

'Later I was asked how I was feeling in an interview, but I felt I didn't have the vocabulary, it was all a bit of a fog,' she said.

Fans of the North London builder insisted 'he was robbed' as the show reached its climax

The climax of the 10-week BBC1 series draw an average audience of 12.3 million - one of the biggest TV audiences of the year.

When the winner of last year's X Factor was crowned in December, the ITV singing contest could manage an audience of 9.7 million.

Last night's show even beat the 2013 finale of Strictly Come Dancing which had an audience of 11.5 million, as well as the most recent Britain's Got Talent final on 10.9 million, putting Bake Off into a new league.

Birtwhistle and her fellow finalists, Burr, 37, and graphic designer Luis Troyano, 42, had to complete the toughest challenges of the series, finishing with a towering 'piece montee' as their showstopper, with sponge, caramel, choux pastry and petit fours, completed in five hours.

She leapt ahead during the technical challenge, coming first with her array of tartes au citron, Victoria sponges and scones, while Burr blew it by coming last.

Birtwhistle, originally from Hull, said it was an emotional moment as the three hopefuls gathered to hear who had won after 10 weeks of competition in which they had undertaken 30 separate challenges.

She said: 'I can remember having to stand for what seemed an eternity to hear the result. I looked at a tree in the distance and focused on that rather than looking at the judges, and felt what will be will be.

'We were all pretty exhausted, Luis was close to tears, and Richard looked the same. I took a big gulp, and realised that this moment was like knowing the snowman is going to melt and it will never be the same again. So it was quite a poignant time for all of us.'

They were joined by the eliminated contenders from throughout the series in the famous marquee pitched on the estate of Welford Park in Berkshire.

Birthwhistle added: 'It was a fabulous day with the sun shining and all my family had come. There was a band playing and it was a lovely atmosphere, we had such a great time and everyone loved it.' 

Disappintment still lingered this morning after the shock news that Ms Birtwhistle had won sunk in

Ms Birtwhistle's win had caught many by surprise with Burr, 37, expected to take the honours after weeks of supremacy

He was the bookies' favourite and had been named 'star baker' five times, to just one week - during the first heat - for the eventual winner

Berry said: 'You never know how the bakers will be affected as we go through filming week by week, but Nancy remained constant throughout. I think it was her quiet determination that drove her through, and the fact that she never really lost her cool.

'It was a close run when it came to judging the final, but Nancy is deservedly our winner and I must admit that I have been inspired by her baking. The bakers have been so keen, so creative and the results have been mindblowing. It's been a real joy to judge this year.'

Hollywood said: 'Nancy has been confident, creative and unafraid as a baker and that showed from the very start. In one of my judgings I called her close to perfection, so that says it for me.

The tearful grandmother-of-eight, dubbed gadget gran, was the unanimous winner of Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry, as announced by presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc after weeks of brilliant bakes

'This series has been one of the best for me, as we have had great bakers who have built on their baking expertise each week. They have shown both a depth of knowledge and a sense of humour, you really couldn't have asked for a better bunch.

'They have really pushed the boundaries of technique this year. The style, the finesse and the precision - the class of 2014 have been exceptional.'

The programme moved from BBC2 to BBC1 for this year's fifth series and created a buzz like never before. It has pulled in around nine million viewers and has become one of the most popular shows on the channel.

BBC1 controller Charlotte Moore said last night: 'It was absolutely right for one of the nation's most talked-about programmes to move to the nation's favourite channel, and I'm more than thrilled BBC1 viewers have taken it to their hearts.'
