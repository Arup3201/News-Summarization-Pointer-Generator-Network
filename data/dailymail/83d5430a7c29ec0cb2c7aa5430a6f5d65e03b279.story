Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has opened the door to his players smoking the occasional cigarette by insisting it does not have an adverse effect on performance.

Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has been reprimanded after being caught smoking in the showers following the Gunners’ 2-0 defeat to Southampton at St Mary’s on New Year’s Day.

The Poland international has been left sweating on his place for Sunday’s clash against Stoke after Wenger refused to guarantee his presence in the starting XI.

Colombia international David Ospina will replace Szczesny, whose position as No 1 was already under threat prior to the smoking incident, should Wenger decide to axe the 24-year-old.

It is not the first time an Arsenal player has been caught in a smoking-related storm. William Gallas and Jack Wilshere have both been publicly criticised by Wenger for smoking in public.

But the Arsenal manager seems relaxed about members of his squad having the odd cigarette, saying: ‘Does the occasional cigarette affect performance? No.

‘If you make a good pass on the football pitch that is what people want to see.

‘I’m sure there are some top sportsmen who smoke, but it is not a good example. The best is you don’t smoke.’

Commenting on whether Szczesny or Ospina will start at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, Wenger added: ‘I have not selected the starting 11 yet. Will I take the (Szczesny) incident into account? I take everything into account.

‘I don’t want to talk about it because what happens in our dressing room stays in our dressing room. Every club has its internal discipline and rules. It doesn’t necessarily need to be public.

‘Ideally you want everybody to behave in the perfect way. I like Wojciech as a person, when he makes a mistake he stands up for it. He’s a guy who learns from his mistakes.

‘He has apologised. He made a mistake. He is not the first one and not the last one.’

Wenger speaks from a position of knowledge having been a smoker himself in his younger days. A video of the Frenchman puffing on a cigarette while on the bench as Monaco coach has gone viral this week amid the controversy surrounding his keeper.

‘The other day I was on French television and they showed me on the bench smoking a cigarette. I didn’t even think it was me,’ said Wenger.

‘At that time, I remember Marcello Lippi at Juventus smoked a cigar during the whole game in every game.

‘I grew up in a pub where you did not see from here to the window because of the smoke and I spent my youth selling cigarettes. But times have changed. Society has had an evolution. In some respects in a positive way, in others a negative way.

‘One of the positives is that people don’t smoke any more. But my issue is that the players here are judged on their performances.

‘Ideally, the best way to have a high level of performance is to behave as well as possible, as close as possible to the rules that allow you to perform.

‘I am against smoking, but I have grown up in a period where I had to accomplish military service, and at the end of the month we got paid by cigarettes, so it incited us to smoke.

‘After, of course, slowly it became banned and it doesn’t exist anymore, but when I was a boy I grew up surrounded by smokers. I smoked myself when I didn’t play anymore.’
