George Zimmerman accused the Sanford police department of corruption more than a year before he shot Trayvon Martin, and said that he observed officers being so lazy it was ‘disgusting’ when he went on ride-alongs with the department.

The Sanford Police Department was embroiled in a scandal a year before Zimmerman shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, and during that time Zimmerman attended a public hearing as an outraged citizen.

He used that forum to criticize the department after the agency covered up the beating of a black homeless man by the son of a white officer.

Case: The prosecution will argue that this footage shows a 'cozy' attitude he held with the police and how he felt comfortable to wander around unattended

In the speech, Zimmerman said he witnessed 'disgusting' behavior by officers when he was part of a ride-along program, though the agency said it did not know when, if ever, Zimmerman was in that program.

'The officer showed me his favorite hiding spots for taking naps. He explained to me he doesn't carry a long gun in his vehicle because in his words, `Anything that requires a long gun requires a lot of paperwork and you're gonna find me as far away from it.''

Zimmerman also said the officer in question 'took two lunch breaks and attended a going away party for one of his fellow officers.'

'I would just like to state that the law is written in black and white,' Zimmerman said during a 90-second statement to city commissioners at a community forum.

'It should not and cannot be enforced in the gray for those who are in the thin blue line.'

The forum took place on January 8, 2011, days after a video of the beating went viral on the Internet and then-Sanford Police Chief Brian Tooley was forced to retire.

In his favor: Public opinion has shifted so that now 40 per cent of Americans believe George Zimmerman acted in self defense, which is up from only 15 per cent who believe such in March

Tooley's department faced criticism for dragging its feet in arresting Justin Collison, the son of a police lieutenant.

'I'd like to know what action the commission is taking in order to repeal Mr. Tooley's pension,' Zimmerman said to the commission.

 'I'm not asking you to repeal his pension; I believe he's already forfeited his pension by his illegal cover-up in corruption in what happened in his department.'

Zimmerman's public comments could be important for his defense because the Martin family and supporters contend the neighborhood watch volunteer singled Martin out because he was black. These comments could be used to lessen the prosecution’s argument that Zimmerman is racist.

The Miami Herald first reported details from the January 2011 community forum Wednesday. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the tape from the meeting.

While the public forum may be helpful for his case, there is also new surveillance footage from inside the police station on a different date which shows Zimmerman walking through the police department unattended.

Benjamin Crump, one of the lawyers hired by the Martin family, contends that the footage shows that Zimmerman had a ‘cozy’ and ‘comfortable’ relationship with the police, which attributed to his quick release on the night of the shooting.

Zimmerman is free on bond awaiting his second-degree murder trial for shooting Martin. Martin was walking back to a townhome he was staying at when he got into a fight with Zimmerman, who shot him in the chest at close range.

Preparations: Both sides are submitting evidence in the coming days as Zimmerman is in hiding

Zimmerman, who claims the February 26 shooting of Martin was self-defense, was initially not arrested. But after protests around the country and an investigation by a state prosecutor, he was charged.

Tooley's successor, Bill Lee, temporarily resigned his post following a no-confidence vote by city commissioners.

Lee offered to resign permanently, but his commissioners turned down his request. He is on paid leave.
