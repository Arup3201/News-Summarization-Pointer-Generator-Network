A family has been left traumatised after staff at an adventure park left them trapped at the top of a Ferris wheel - after switching off the lights and closing up for the night.

Darren and Lynzie Riggs-Long and their three young children were left in cage at the top of the wheel at Adventure Island, Southend, Essex.

The children screamed as their parents desperately tried to get staff's attention as the cage was blown about in the wind.

Mr Riggs-Long, 38, from north London, had brought his family for a four-day stay at the seaside town.

But he said that his children are so traumatised he has since cut his holiday short.

He said: 'We couldn’t believe it. We were at the top of the wheel when the lights went out and staff started shutting the lights down on all the rides just before 10pm. It was cold and really dark. We were calling out for about 15 minutes before a member of the public spotted us and went to get a staff member.

The couple’s children Kieran ten, Lewis, six, and three-year-old Jack have since had nightmares.

'The attendant came back and switched the lights back on and got us down. The children are traumatised. Lewis woke up in the night crying and Kieran woke up shouting “get me down”.'

The family were given five free wrist bands and meals for another visit to Adventure Island but the father has said he will give them away.

He added: 'The kids don’t want to go there anymore. It is a shame because we had a great day. It was our second day in Southend and we spent all day there from 11.30am.

'We went on the rides and ate there. It was our very last ride and this happened. It spoiled the whole thing.

'I just want to get the kids home to some stability so they forget all this. They need to look at the procedures they have for shutting down at night.'

Mrs Riggs-Long, a former pharmacist and now full-time mother, said: 'We were having a lovely time until this happened.

'I have family here and I was looking forward to spending a few more days with them but Lewis wants to go home.

'They were extremely apologetic and have said the attendant will be disciplined but I don’t blame her. She was just a young girl. I blame Adventure Island and the training they give youngsters.'

Adventure Island said: 'The health and safety of our customers is of paramount concern to Adventure Island.

'We are sorry that Riggs-Long family were unfortunately left for a very short amount of time (2mins and 58 seconds according to CCTV) at the top of the Ferris Wheel and have offered them wristbands and meals to make up for this.

'A member of staff was at the ride the entire time this was taking place to reassure them we were going to resolve the issue as swiftly as possible, which we did.'
