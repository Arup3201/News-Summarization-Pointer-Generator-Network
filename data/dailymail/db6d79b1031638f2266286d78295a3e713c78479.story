A group of super-slimmers in Essex have shed the equivalent weight of an African elephant in just 12 months.

The staggering bulk - 925 stone, or nearly six tonnes - was lost after members of a weight loss group in Braintree decided to change their eating habits in 2012.

The 200-strong group lost, on average, 4.5 stone each, but married couple Simon and Tracy
Bartlett, 34 and 43, were the group's most successful slimmers, dropping 15 stone between them in just 18 months.

'I feel fantastic': Simon and Tracy Bartlett lost 15 stone between them at the slimming club after totally transforming their diet, taking up walking and gaining support from the group and each other

'I was worried I wouldn't have the willpower': Simon and Tracy, pictured before they started dieting, say their experience of losing the weight helps them to support others

The 925 stone lost by the whole group is, in fact, the weight of a fully-grown African elephant - the largest land-living animal on the planet.

Heidi Cripps, weight loss consultant for the successful Slimming World group in Braintree, Essex, explained the brand's weight-loss plan.

She said: ‘Rather than the diet boxes or the shakes, they are encouraged to eat bread, potato, pasta, meat, fish, fruit and vegetables - the normal stuff.

‘For instance, people can still eat roast dinners, jacket potatoes and shepherd's pies. People fill up on good food so they don't tend to overeat on chocolate and snacks.'

No more junk in the trunk: The slimming club in Braintree, Essex, are celebrating after shedding 925 stone - the weight of an African Elephant - in a year

She continued: ‘I am really proud of everyone in the
group - they've done it themselves. I turn up with the scales, but they
are the ones who put the effort in.'

Impressive: Adult African elephants stand up to 3m tall and weigh between 4.4 and 7.7 tonnes

Mr Bartlett said that working to lose weight as part of a team with his wife Tracey was a big help, as there was always someone around who knew what you were going through.

He said: ‘I was worried at first as I thought I may not have the willpower,
but once you reach your goal you think, "I can do this".

‘Doing it with someone else has been a massive help: we keep each other going. If one of us is having a bad day, the other is always there to give support.

‘We'd walk round the fields close to home, increasing the amount we were doing each day. Now we walk four miles a day, and on weekends up to 20.

‘Being out in the open air in the countryside is fantastic. Sometimes it really shows you what life is for.

‘We still go to Slimming World every week to help us stay on track, weigh in and of course to give others the encouragement we got.

‘It's a fantastic feeling helping others reach their targets.’
