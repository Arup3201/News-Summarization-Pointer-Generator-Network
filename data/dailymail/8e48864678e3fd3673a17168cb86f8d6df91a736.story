A mother has been left infuriated after her perfect healthy four-year-old son was labelled as 'clinically obese' by medics based on his BMI score.

Mari Moore, 41, was sent the note by health bosses after her son Oshea-Mkai Moore Woodbine, known as Teyo, had his height and weight recorded as part of a school health check.

She was astonished to read Teyo had been placed in the 'very overweight' category based on his Body Mass Index (BMI), despite him being perfectly fit and healthy.

Angered: Mari Moore was furious after receiving a letter from the Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust telling her that Teyo, 4, was 'clinically obese'

Based on Teyo being 114cm tall and weighing 25kg, he has been classed as 'clinically obese'.

Single mother Mari, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: 'There's absolutely nothing wrong with him. You can see for yourself that he doesn't have a weight problem.

'I think it's despicable they're branding a four-year-old as having a weight problem. No wonder children develop eating disorders when they're told they're fat, even though they're not.

'This will go on his record and that's what makes me most angry. They're giving out the totally wrong impression.'

Perfectly healthy: Teyo, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, had his BMI measured as art of a school health check

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight.

If you have a BMI above the healthy range you are at raised risk of the serious health problems linked to being overweight, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers.

BMI results are interpreted differently for children and consider weight in relation to height, age and sex. The result is called the child’s BMI centile.

Once your child’s BMI centile has been calculated, they will be in one of four categories:

Underweight: Below 2nd BMI centile

Healthy weight: Between the 2nd and 90th BMI centile

Overweight: Between 91st and to 97th BMI centile

Obese: At or above 98th BMI centile. This BMI centile category is called 'very overweight' in letters that are sent by the National Child Measurement Programme.

Mari, also mother to Chante Henry, 21, and seven-month-old Stevie Cree, said she prides herself on ensuring all her children are fit and healthy.

She added: 'I walk them to school every morning, and I make sure they eat healthily.

'My son is very active and has a good diet. I cook everything from fresh. My idea of a ready meal is left-over Spaghetti Bolognase. 

I cook in batches and freeze it, and then if my daughter is having a grizzly day, I can get something out of the freezer for us and I know everything that's gone in it.'

Teyo started Holy Rosary and St Anne's Roman Catholic Primary School in Leeds, West Yorkshire, in September and soon afterwards was weighed as part of the National Child Measurement Programme.

But Mari, a insurance claims advisor, has slammed the Government scheme, and believes other checks need to be done before children are labelled in such a way.

She said: 'You have to use some decorum of common sense. They work out these measurements but no-one is using their eyesight to make a realistic view.

'If they're sending letters out like this they're going to make people think they're overweight even if they're not, and instigate a whole load of problems.'

Warning: The letter sent to Ms Moore put her son in the 'very overweight' category despite the fact that he is perfectly healthy

The letter also explained each category with 'very overweight' meaning the person is 'clinically obese' and is 'more likely to develop diabetes and high blood pressure'

A spokesman for Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'Our School Nursing team takes care to ensure the process of the National Child Measurement Programme is explained to the child and families who take part in the programme, from before they are measured to after they receive their outcome letter from Public Health England.

'Defining children as overweight or obese is a complex process. The School Nursing team follows the guidelines set by the Department of Health, which uses BMI.

'If a child has a BMI over 98th percentile, the team will offer a referral to Watch It, the trust's community-based weight management programme.'
