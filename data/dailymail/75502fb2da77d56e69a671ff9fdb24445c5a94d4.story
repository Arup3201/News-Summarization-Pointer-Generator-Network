Young British tourists will be taking unnecessary risks with their health when they head off on their holidays this summer – because many do not take adequate precautions.

A new survey compiled by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the travel association ABTA has found that over a third of Britons between the ages of 16 and 24 do not bother to take out travel insurance before they visit a foreign destination.

Some 38 per cent of Britons in this age group do not think travel insurance is necessary – despite the danger of high hospital bills – according to the research.

And almost half of holidaymakers in the same age bracket are cavalier about travelling without an insurance safety net - saying they are prepared to take the risk.

Nearly one in five think their adventures are covered by the British taxpayer – 16 per cent assume that the government will pay for their health costs if they become ill while abroad and do not have a travel insurance policy to cover their expenses.

And almost half – 42 per cent – refuse to take out travel insurance because they say it is too expensive.

A worrying number of British youngsters also have the wrong impression about the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).

Nearly one in five believe that the card acts as a full insurance policy while abroad – when it only provides access to state medical care in countries that are part of the European Economic Area (EEA) – all members of the European Union, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

Switzerland also comes under the EHIC remit.

The survey’s findings should be a wake-up call for young people, FCO minister Mark Simmonds stresses.

‘It’s the time of year when people are preparing to travel abroad for summer trips, including some for the first time without their parents,’ Mr Simmonds says.

‘Arranging comprehensive travel insurance should be at the top of their to-do list before departing. An accident or emergency abroad can end up costing thousands, and it’s often the family who is left to cover the costs.

‘Although we will do what we can to support people who encounter difficulties while abroad, the FCO cannot cover medical bills or fly them home.’

Victoria Bacon of ABTA adds that ‘every year ABTA sees tragic cases of young people who have had an accident while on holiday overseas that requires serious medical help.

‘In some cases, parents are presented with massive medical bills because their children went on holiday uninsured.’
