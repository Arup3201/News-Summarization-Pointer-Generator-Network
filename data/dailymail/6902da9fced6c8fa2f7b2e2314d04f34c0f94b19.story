New Year axe murder victim Tanis Bhandari was killed after a trivial argument over a cigarette, it was claimed yesterday.

The 27-year-old plasterer was described as a ‘peaceful’ former member of the Royal Navy who doted on his younger siblings.

More than 100 of his friends and family gathered yesterday outside the village pub where he died in a horrific axe attack an hour into the new year.

Dozens of bunches of flowers were left on the tiny green by the Kings Arms in sleepy Tamerton Foliot on the edge of Plymouth, Devon. 

Many mourners – including a woman believed to be the victim’s mother, Andrea Sharpe – wore shirts bearing the logo of his favourite football club, Liverpool.  

Two men have been arrested on suspicion of murder, though neither has been charged. 

It was today claimed the attack came about when one of the suspects asked a female friend of Mr Bhandari's for a cigarette. 

When she said no, Mr Bhandari, a builder, stood in front of her to protect her from harm, a source told MailOnline. 

It was then he was attacked with a knife and axe-like weapon, the source added. 

Devon and Cornwall Police would not confirm the altercation had begun over a cigarette, but said Mr Bhandari was the victim of an unprovoked attack. 

'The evidence gathered so far points to this being an indiscriminate attack on a group of innocent young men, resulting in a tragic outcome,' Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said today. 

'I understand and appreciate how this attack has come as a shock to many, especially the residents of Tamerton Foliot.

'I would like to reassure you that we are doing everything we can and want to highlight that we currently have two suspects in custody.

'Interviews with them are continuing and at this stage, it is my belief that no other suspects remain at large.'

An axe was later recovered by detectives, with residents asked to check their gardens and bins for a missing knife as police continued to search for clues.

Two men, aged 20 and 21, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in police custody 

Devon and Cornwall Police this afternoon sought an extension from Magistrates to continue questioning the pair. 

Friends have today paid tribute to Mr Bhandari who they described as 'kind' and 'an amazing friend'. 

More than 100 people gathered at around 10.30am yesterday to lay flowers outside the pub in the historic village, which is popular with walkers. 

Liverpool football tops and scarves were tied to trees nearby. Friends and colleagues paid tribute to Mr Bhandari on Twitter and Facebook.

Andy Nicholls wrote: ‘Gutted to hear that the victim of the unprovoked NYE attack in Plymouth was a former Navy shipmate. RIP Tanis “Bandi” Bhandari. Sleep well.’

Bouncer Andy Dymond-Park said he was working in the pub and saw the attack happen.

He wrote on Facebook: ‘Horrendous events to witness last night and absolutely terrifying. My heart goes out to the victims and their friends and family at this sad start to the new year after what was such a good night. Bit shaken up by it all but I’m fine, feel terrible for everyone involved. It has just hit hard. Could have been anyone involved.’

A spokesman for the Kings Arms, where the 27-year-old had been celebrating with friends on New Year's Eve before his death, said the men were 'lovely' people. 

'On New Year’s Eve a terrible attack was made on a lovely group of people on the way home from a great night in our pub.

'It was an unprovoked violent attack with a tragic consequences. That I feel devastated is an absolute understatement.

'I wish all the families of those involved my deepest deepest sympathy, not that this will help them in any way now but, I wish I could turn back the clock so that these events would not occur.'

Mourners today paid tribute to the man described as 'kind' and 'peaceful'. 

One friend, who declined to be named, said: 'He was very peaceful and a very relaxed guy.

'I would say hello to him every morning when I saw him. He would often care for his younger twin siblings.' 

Others shared their grief on Facebook. 

'Can’t believe it, I grew up in the same village as Tanis, he’s always been a kind lad, you will truly be missed bud, my thoughts are with his family and may whoever done this get what he deserves,' said Lee Ryder while Colleen Finn added: 'We've lost our jester, I feel ripped to pieces.' 

Police have appealed for anyone with information about the incident to come forward.  

Devon and Cornwall Police continue investigating the scene following the arrest of two men, aged 20 and 21

Forensics teams sweep leaves and rocks near to where the man and his friends were attacked 

Police are still appealing for information about the attack which took place in the early hours of Thursday morning
