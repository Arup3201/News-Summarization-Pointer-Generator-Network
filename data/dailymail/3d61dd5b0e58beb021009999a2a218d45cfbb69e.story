The precise moment two of the most powerful and destructive volcanoes in Russia erupted and began spewing lava and ash hundreds of feet into the air have been caught on camera.

British volcanic photographer Dr Richard Roscoe stayed awake for up to 20 hours straight in a bid to capture the shots of the Shiveluch and Kliuchevskoi volcanoes in the Kamchatka region.

Shiveluch and Kliuchevskoi are among 150 volcanoes situated in the region and are classed as stratovolcanoes because of their giant height; with their summits reaching 10,771ft and 15,862ft respectively.

Roscoe travelled thousands of miles from his home in Munich, Germany, to the Far East of Russia, to take the shots.Â 

At Shiveluch, he plotted just 3.5 
miles away in an area previously destroyed by a previous eruption. While
picturing Klichevskoi, the closest Roscoe could safely get was 12.5 miles 
away.

Dr Roscoe, a 
molecular biologist, said: 'At Shiveluch we camped in an area that had 
no trees left thanks to a previous eruption. It meant we were able to 
get much better pictures with nothing in the way.

'But
the trouble with a lava dome is these things are unstable - it could 
look benign but them suddenly collapse. If that had happened we would 
have been gone.

'That's why we always travel in groups to these events so that there is support if you need help.'

Dr
Roscoe, who says his extreme hobby can sometimes leave his family 
concerned, has spent the last 10 years travelling the globe in search of photographing and 
picturing eruptions, also known as 'volcano hunting.'

Ash eruption from the summit of the Shiveluch lava dome. Shiveluch is a stratovolcano - one of Kamchatka's largest volcanoes - with a summit of 10,771 feet. Shiveluch increased activity in May 2009 and has been periodically spewing ash up to distances of six miles ever since

The eruption of the Kliuchevskoi volcano is shown reflected in the Kamchatka river. The first Kliuchevskoi eruption was recorded in 1697 and it has been almost continuously active ever since. The volcano was first climbed in 1788. Several climbers were killed by flying lava when they attempted the ascent in 1931

This image shows the destruction caused by the Shiveluch volcano on the surrounding areas. Dead trees sit on the embankment of an erosion gully. So-called pyroclastic flow, or the flow of hot gas and rocks, from the eruption would have caused this trench to develop in the landscape. It sits approximately six miles from the Shiveluch lava dome

These latest photos, captured earlier this month, show lava spewing out from the two stratovolcanoes before 
trickling down the rocky sides. Huge clouds of ash can then be seen 
developing above the active volcanoes.

Shiveluch was most recently active between 11 October and 16 October, while Kiluchevskoi was last active between 16 October and 22 October.

Dr Roscoe said the key to his success was to capitalise on small windows of good weather: 'It is very difficult to get close and conditions can often be 
poor - snow and gale force winds are common. We had only small windows 
when the clouds cleared to capture the photographs.

'Volcanoes are quite volatile things so you have to make the most of a clear skies before it changes again.'

Kamchatka sits at a similar 
latitude to the UK but arctic winds from Siberia along with
the Oyashio sea current mean the peninsula is covered in 
snow from October to late May.

Dr
Roscoe uses a Canon digital SLR and lenses with a wide 
opening to allow as much light in as possible.

Lava flows from the dome of the Russian Shiveluch volcano. Shiveluch was most recently active between October 11 and October 16. It has had over 60 large explosive eruptions during the past 10,000 years. Slowly rising lava domes may grow for months or for several years following explosive eruptions

Dr Richard Roscoe is shown in front of the Kliuchevskoi volcano to west of the Kamchatka region in Russia. Dr Roscoe has been chasing volcano eruptions for 10 years and uses a Canon digital SLR alongside lenses with a wide opening to allow as much light in as possible. He camped 12.5 miles away from the volcano's dome in an area previously destroyed by lava

There are more than 150 volcanoes on Kamchatka and up to 30 of them are active.

Shiveluch 
has had over 60 large eruptions during the past 10,000 years and in 1956, a large part of
the lava dome collapsed and created a debris avalanche.

The volcanoes of Kamchatka are a large 
group of volcanoes situated on the Kamchatka peninsula which is above the Kamchatka 
River and the surrounding valley.

The highest volcano is the Kliuchevskoi, or Klyuchevskaya 
Sopka, which is also the largest active volcano in the Northern
Hemisphere.

The first eruption of the Kliuchevskoi was recorded in 1697, and it has been almost 
continuously active ever since.

Ash cloud is seen rising from the Kliuchevskoi volcano - the highest mountain on the Kamchatka Peninsula and the highest active volcano in Eurasia. As the lava flow travels down from the stratovolcano's dome it melts the snow and glaciers below. This creates a cloud of steam that rises from end of the flow

This image shows the glowing rockfall from the Shiveluch volcano in the background, and an erosion gully created by previous eruptions in the foreground. In 2007, the ash cloud caused by an eruption from this volcano soared 32,000 feet in to the air
