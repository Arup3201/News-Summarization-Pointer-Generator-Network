More veterans are set to storm the barricades of Washington DC's shuttered national monuments today in protest at the government shutdown after Congress refused to fund the healthcare act.

Former servicemen are plotting to occupy the capital's closed Second World War Memorial for a second day, and also broaden their protests to other sites including the Lincoln Memorial.

The planned acts of civil disobedience by defiant veterans in their 80s and 90s threatens to fan the flames of an already fierce fight over who is responsible for denying the federal government the funds to operate.

Next objective: Washington DC's Lincoln Memorial, which has also been closed by the government shutdown, could be next on the list of veterans' targets as they seek to broaden their protest against the political deadlock

Beyond boundaries: Veterans from Iowa were able to tour the World War II Memorial in Washington on Tuesday  after removing the fences closing the site due to the U.S. government shutdown

Defiant: Veterans on an Honor Flight tour visit the World War II Memorial in Washington DC even the the site was officially closed because of the government shutdown

The National Mall's memorial to the 
U.S.'s Second World War dead became a political battlefield yesterday 
when a group of 91 former servicemen who had travelled from Mississippi 
'stormed' its barricades.

They
 were among hundreds who had arrived for a planned visit to the memorial
 morning to find it shuttered by the National Park Service after the 
shutdown went into effect at midnight.

And they were quickly joined by conservative politicians who accused Democrats of being to blame for the monument's closure.

There
 could be a repeat of those scenes today when more groups from the Honor
 Flight Network - a non-profit group that arranges free visits to the 
Second World War Memorial for veterans - arrive in DC to visit the 
monument.

One Honor Flight volunteer said they were considering staging further protests elsewhere.

Jamie
 Miller, a five-year veteran of the Marine Corps, told Buzzfeed: 'We are
 thinking about jumping the Lincoln memorial too. If Lincoln was a war 
memorial I would do it in a heart beat.'

Yesterday
 members of Congress, including Republican Reps. Michele Bachmann of 
Minnesota, and Steven Palazzo, of Mississippi, rushed to Second World 
War Memorial and cut police tape to let in the veterans.

'I find it disappointing and disgusting for our country to have to go through this,' said Bob Hunter, 90, of Gulfport, Mississippi to the Daily News.

Mr Hunter survived a plane crash and climbed the Eiffel Tower to post a radio transmitter on top as a member of the Army Signal Corps during the Second World War.

'I feel like we deserve better,' Hunter said. 'Somewhere, somehow, somebody screwed up.'

Tom Lucas, of Pontotoc, Mississippi was one of five brothers who fought in World War II, said the memorial’s closure 'hurt us.'

'I crossed the North Atlantic 20 times on convoy duty,' said Mr Lucas, 87, to the Daily News. 'I ended up in Tokyo Bay for the signing of the surrender.'

'We did our share, and the last thing people should do is not let us in and not let people open the gate.'

'We took on the Germans and the Japs and we whipped them, and then we have to take this sort of thing? It makes you wonder if these people work for the U.S government or for themselves.'

MIchelle Bachmann said it was ‘pure joy’ when 
members of the greatest generation were allowed in because they had 
traveled so far to honor their fallen comrades.

She
 added that her fellow congressmen and women plan to continue coming 
down to the memorial every day while the shutdown continues to ensure 
veterans’ access.

‘America is not shutting down,’ she told CNN. ‘If we have anything to say about it, we're going to keep this open.’

Park
 spokeswoman Carol Johnson said the service didn't want to keep veterans
 out, but the agency was directed to close all memorials after the 
Congress failed to approve a budget resolution, leading to the first 
government shutdown in 17 years.

Tough guys: Many of the veterans at the site were wheelchair-bound or relying on walking canes to get around

A long-running dispute between Democrats
 and Republicans over President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act 
stalled a temporary funding bill, forcing about 800,000 federal workers 
off the job and suspending most non-essential federal programs and 
services.

‘We’re looking about how to deal with this in the future,’ Johnson said.

Leo Shane III, a reporter for the newspaper Stars and Stripes who was present at the memorial, tweeted that he witnessed Rep Steve King, of Iowa, distracting a Park Service officer while veterans knocked down the barricades.

Members of The Mississippi Gulf Honor Flight - a nonprofit group that arranges free visits to the Second World War Memorial for veterans - made their way to the capital visit the memorial.

Wayne Lennep, a spokesman for the organization, said they had planned the visit long before the shutdown and could not cancel the pilgrimage.

Keeping history locked up: One of the clearest examples of the effect of the shutdown comes from the closure of all National Parks

Close as you can get: A last minute effort by Republicans to reopen the National Parks failed on Tuesday evening, thought it was viewed by many as a stopgap to lessen the backlash against the GOP

Nationwide: A cyclist had to cut his ride short on Tuesday in Saguaro National Park in Tuscon, Arizona

The 91 veterans, many of them wheelchair-bound or using walking canes to get around, arrived at Reagan National Airport in an $80,000 chartered plane on Tuesday morning.

They boarded buses and arrived at the
 memorial at around 11.30am, only to discover metal fences around the 
site and printed signs announcing that the memorial has been closed due 
to the government shutdown.

Even
 though park police officers were patrolling the area, they made no 
attempts to stop the veterans and congressmen who came to their aid from
 moving the barriers and entering the site.

‘I thought I was going to have to stand back when we first got here,’ veteran Robert Meredith told The Epoch Times. ‘I feel extremely lucky. This is really nice, a great honor.’

Fighting back: Protestors demonstrated by the Capitol demanding the House pass a Continuing Resolution without any amendments that attempted to defund the Affordable Care Act

Defending themselves: Republicans, lead by Senator David Vitter at the podium, called for Democrats to compromise and allow them to pass a version of a budget to end the shutdown

Sticking on message: Democratic House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi pushed for Americans to enroll in the national healthcare system that was launched today

The gray-haired and stooped visitors were able to lay a wreath at the Mississippi pillar and take pictures before leaving the site less than an hour later.

Besides the travelers from Mississippi, a group of veterans from Iowa dressed in bright yellow shirts were also allowed to access the memorial.

At the Korean War Memorial, a group of veterans from Puerto Rico also stormed the barricades to lay a wreath, The Washington Post reported.

Rep. Bill Huizenga, of Michigan, called the veterans’ bold actions ‘the best civil disobedience we've seen in Washington in a while,’ according to The Gulf Live.

The veterans’ decision to ignore the shutdown and move fences aside in order to pay their respects to military heroes has drawn bipartisan support from members of the House and Senate alike.

Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, posted on Twitter that he would be donating his pay during the shutdown to the Honor Flight organization in his home state, while Republican Sen. John McCain, of Arizona, simply tweeted, ‘Good for them.’
