Questioned: An officer believed to be PC Kevin Szabo, pictured as a PCSO, allegedly stole a police car before crashing it into the entrance gate of his headquarters

An off-duty policeman is believed to 
have stolen a Force car for showdown talks with his bosses before 
crashing it into the entrance gate at his headquarters.

The
 39-year-old officer allegedly took the vehicle without permission this 
morning from outside a police station in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.

He was later arrested at the Cheshire Constabulary Headquarters in Winsford, some 25 miles away.

The tall green gates to the rear of the HQ were visibly crumpled today, after the officer reportedly drove the car into them, and the entrance was sealed off with police tape.

He had reportedly gone to the HQ as he wanted to speak with senior police bosses.

The alleged theft comes days after the same officer, named by the Liverpool Echo as PC Kevin Szabo, was at the centre of a six-hour stand-off at his home in Prestatyn, North Wales.

PC Szabo, who lives in Prestatyn, but serves with Cheshire Police and is thought to be based at the Ellesmere Port station, was said to be involved in a 'disturbance' in which he barricaded himself inside a house.

Police refused to confirm the name of the
 officer involved, as the force was carrying out an 'active 
investigation' into the matter.

'At 10.23am on Wednesday 29 January 2014, a police vehicle was taken
 from Ellesmere Port police station by an officer,' said a police 
spokesman.

'A 39-year-old man was arrested at Cheshire Constabulary Headquarters in Winsford for theft of a vehicle.'

It was confirmed that the same officer had been involved in both the alleged theft of the car and the stand-off on Monday, and that he had recently been on sick leave from the force.

'Since September the Constabulary has 
been supporting an officer from the Ellesmere Port area who has been 
absent through ill health,' said Deputy
 Chief Constable Helen King from Cheshire Police.

'On Monday the Cheshire Constabulary supported North Wales Police to resolve an incident at the officer’s address in Prestatyn.

'Today
 the officer was able to take possession of a police car and drive it to
 the Force Headquarters at Winsford where he was arrested.

'The incident 
was professionally managed to ensure that the public and members of 
staff were not put at risk. Nobody suffered any injuries, although minor
 damage was caused to the police car. The investigation is ongoing.

'The
 Constabulary provides extensive help and support to officers and staff 
through line managers, the Occpational Health Unit, help lines, the 
Police Federation and Unison, recognising the demanding and stressful 
nature of police work. The support available, together with the security
 of police premises and property, are being reviewed as a result of 
today’s incident.'

Five police cars and two riot vans had attended the incident in Prestatyn, with the street sealed off with a police cordon.

The drama only ended after specialist negotiators managed to convince the officer to leave the property.

He was then driven away by a relative.

Superintendent Pete 
Newton, who was in charge of Monday's police response said: 'Supported by 
our partners in the North Wales Fire and Rescue Service and Welsh 
Ambulance Service, highly trained resources were quickly deployed to the
 scene and our objective of protecting the public, our staff and the 
house occupant was achieved.'

A spokesman for North Wales Police said that no further action would be taken in relation to the stand-off because a criminal offence had not taken place.
