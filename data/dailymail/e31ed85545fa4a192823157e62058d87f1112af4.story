On reality show Made in Chelsea, the petty squabbles and vindictive fallouts of London’s ultra-privileged super-rich are played out across the screen.

But one of the programme’s regulars could soon be airing her dirty laundry on a different stage, after her ex-boyfriend moved to take their fight over £210,000 worth of jewellery to the High Court.

Ian Hudaly, 33, dated 25-year-old Made in Chelsea regular Emma Miller on and off between 2009 and 2013. 

When the relationship ended for good last September, he asked her to hand back a diamond and sapphire Cartier bracelet and its matching ring.

Ian Hudaly, 33, dated 25-year-old Made in Chelsea regular Emma Miller (above) on and off between 2009 and 2013. When the relationship ended for good last September, he asked her to hand back a diamond and sapphire Cartier bracelet and its matching ring

Miss Miller – who is said to have dated A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio – refused, prompting Mr Hudaly, the son of a multi-millionaire dentist, to put forward a civil legal claim.

The explosive document accuses the model of subjecting him to ‘emotional abuse’ by taunting him over presents she received from ‘a series of gentlemen’ – which he says led him to fear she was ‘acting as an escort’.

And it sheds some light on the affluent pair’s remarkable tiffs, claiming she took a £36,000 vase as well as his two passports when he didn’t give her the jewellery she wanted for her birthday.

Miss Miller, a regular on the celebrity circuit, has been pictured with American reality queen Kim Kardashian and once boasted on her Twitter account of enjoying breakfast at Harrods with Stella McCartney.

The model has featured in L’Oreal and Avon campaigns, and is said to have dated DiCaprio in 2009.

Only this week she was spotted in St Tropez where she attended the star’s charity gala.

She is also said to have romanced the star of US TV show Desperate Housewives Jesse Metcalfe.

Miss Miller is a regular on the E4 reality show Made in Chelsea. 

She joined in April as the love interest of womaniser Spencer Matthews – whose family own an exclusive Caribbean hotel. But her former flames seem to have landed her in hot water with her ex.

His claim refers to her ‘series of gentlemen’ admirers, saying: ‘The claimant avers that the relationship suffered because the defendant subjected him to emotional abuse by taunting him with expensive gifts, travel and accommodation provided by a series of gentlemen, which led him to be concerned she was acting as an escort.’

Mr Hudaly’s claim continues: ‘The claimant is the owner of a Cartier sapphire and diamond bangle and a sapphire and diamond ring.

‘The jewellery’s value is £210,117.75. The claimant demanded the return of the jewellery, but the defendant refuses to return it. Any claim that the jewellery was gifted to her is expressly denied.’

The legal document goes on to detail the row about property developer Mr Hudaly’s ‘Lalique serpent vase’ worth £36,220 and his two passports.

It says: ‘The defendant admitted she had taken the vase and the passports without his knowledge. She stated she had taken them because he had not given her a particular bracelet she desired as a birthday present.

‘She subsequently returned the passports because our client was required to travel. She eventually agreed to return the vase to the claimant’s solicitors via her brother.’

Mr Hudaly’s claim concludes by demanding the return of the jewellery or £210,000, plus interest, and suggests damages could also be due.

Mr Hudaly works in the investments office of his father, David Hudaly, who made £120million selling the chain of dentists he started in Bolton. 

His son, who lives in a £1million flat in Belgravia, said last night: ‘I don’t particularly have any ill-will towards Emma – I just want the jewellery back. It was a loan to her. She wants to be famous and I think the whole fame thing has gone to her head.’

But in yet another twist in the sorry tale, Mr Hudaly later claimed that he was considering withdrawing his claim to save his ex any embarrassment. 

Last night a spokesman for Miss Miller said she was unavailable for comment, but her lawyer stressed that she has denied all the claims.
