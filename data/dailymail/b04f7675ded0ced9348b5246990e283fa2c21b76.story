Lionel Messi may have the weight of a nation on his shoulders, but he wasn’t showing it as Argentina returned to training on Wednesday.

The South American side scraped into the last eight of the World Cup thanks to an extra-time goal from Angel Di Maria against Switzerland on Tuesday night.

Messi was again the architect for La Albiceleste and they now take on Belgium in Brasilia on Saturday.

The Barcelona forward was pictured joking with team-mate Fernando Gago as he appeared to take it easy after his exertions the previous night.

Taking a more active part was striker Sergio Aguero who missed the Switzerland clash with a thigh strain. The Manchester City man was running with the ball during the training session in Vespasiano.

Aguero played in all three of Argentina’s group games but has so far failed to find the net.

Meanwhile, the daughter of a prominent Argentine TV reporter has been killed in a car crash.

Argentina’s Football Association expressed its condolences for the death of 26-year-old Maria Soledad Fernandez, also a journalist, who was killed in a road accident while returning from the match against Switzerland. Two of her colleagues were injured in the crash.

Striker Ezequiel Lavezzi also expressed condolences on Twitter while Argentine journalists held a minute of silence during a news conference.

Fernandez was in Brazil with her father Miguel ‘Titi’ Fernandez, a well-known TV personality in Argentina, who is covering the World Cup for Argentine public TV. He was not in the car.

Brazilian authorities said the car lost control and fell off a cliff and Fernandez was thrown out of the vehicle.
