Ed Miliband’s leadership has reached a ‘crunch point’, senior Labour figures have warned after slipped behind the Tories in several polls.

The Labour leader will have dinner with his new US election guru David Axelrod in a bid to get his campaign back on track, as economic optimism surged to record levels.

It comes as Ed Balls issued a warning that Labour will not win as an ‘anti-business party’ and frontbenchers urged the leadership to address issues which concern ordinary people.

Unease in Labour ranks has been heightened by the evaporation of the party’s lead in the polls.

There are also concerns that the popularity of individual policies is not matched by enthusiasm for the idea of Mr Miliband becoming Prime Minister.

One shadow cabinet minister said: ‘A month ago we were more confident. Now we are at a crunch point.

‘Over the next few months we need to start setting out the results of the policy review and decide what we are focussing on.’

Another frontbencher added: ‘When I see Ed on TV I think “who is that?” It’s not the Ed I know in private.

‘Voters don’t see someone who is authentic. I don’t know how you address that, but it needs to be addressed soon.’

Attacks on energy firms, banks and landlords have also raised fears that the party is anti-business.

In an apparent swipe at the leader’s strident attacks, shadow chancellor Ed Balls told the FT: ‘I don’t think Labour will win the next election as an anti-business party.’

Yesterday former Labour trade minister Lord Digby Jones warned: ‘The Labour leadership is one of the least business-friendly leaders of political parties I’ve seen for years.’

53 per cent of people think the UK economy will improve over the next year, according to Ipsos MORI while just 18 per cent think it will get worse

Polls at the weekend showed two-thirds of people backed Labour's policies on freezing energy bills, state-run railways and increasing rent controls, but only 23 per cent think Mr Miliband is up to the job of being Prime Minister.

Mr Axelrod, Barack Obama's election guru, is meeting Labour's top brass for two days of intensive discussions, including dinner with leader Mr Miliband tonight.

Mr Axelrod was hired last month on a reported six-figure salary to provide advice as the party goes into what is expected to be a fiercely fought campaign for the May 2015 general election.

Labour has said he will be an integral part of their team, working closely with campaign co-ordinator Douglas Alexander and the party's senior pollster Stan Greenberg. He is expected to take part in regular strategic discussions with Mr Miliband.

However there are growing tensions at the top of the party about which issues it should focus on at the election.

Conflicting camps are pushing for social care, child care, energy bills, the NHS, the cost of living, reversing the bedroom tax and taxing the rich to be put centre stage.

Party strategists have struggled with how to respond to the dramatic pace of the economic recovery.

David Cameron today celebrated a record surge in employment figures to 30.4million as the Bank of England upgraded its growth forecasts, predicting 3.4% growth this year and 2.9 per cent next year, up from 2.7 per cent.

Fewer than a quarter of voters think Mr Miliband is up to the job of being Prime Minister 

Polls suggest voters support Labour policies, but are unconvinced that they will be delivered

Labour’s Rachel Reeves said the jobs figures were ‘welcome’ but referred to the ‘so-called recovery’.

It comes as Ipsos MORI said economic optimism is at its highest ever point in its 36-year history.

Overall 53 per cent of people think the UK economy will improve over the next year.

Just 18 per cent think it will get worse, while 25 per cent think it will stay the same. Four in ten Labour (41 per cent) predict the econmy will get better.

Support for Labour is also down three points this month on 34 per cent, with the Conservatives unchanged on 31 per cent, the Lib Dems on 9 per cent and Ukip down four points to 11 per cent.

Gideon Skinner, Head of Political Research at Ipsos MORI said: ‘With a year to go - and only a few weeks to the local and European elections - neither of the main parties will be feeling comfortable.

‘Labour’s average share this year is down four points from their 2012 average, but the Conservatives are also staying stubbornly in the low 30s, despite the best economic optimism we’ve seen in 36 years of asking the question.’
