Bunny Hunter - real name Michelle Rovinsky - is making waves as unlikely advocate for guns, God, and gore.

The 32-year-old Tampa, Florida, native, who boasts a substantial weapons collection and has a fondness for hunting, skinning and gutting her game, wants to be a better role model for women - and features in a new bTV segment to spread her message.

'Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Miley Cyrus have no morals, they are terrible role models for young women,' says the 100lbs bleach-blonde firearms-enthusiast. 'I want to show women that you don’t have to act like a slut to get ahead.'

Hard-gore: Bunny is an avid hunter who has a fondness for hunting, skinning and gutting her game

'Someone looks at me and they think, "what a cute little Barbie,"' Bunny clucks, in a clip for her bTV appearance. 'Little do they know, they've got something coming their way if they try and mess with me.' And her cutesy appearance isn't just a coincidence; it's all part of her master plan.

'I see my make-up and clothes as kind of like camouflage,' she explains. 'People let 
their guard down and I let them think I’m stupid if I want.'

Bunny grew up in what she refers to affectionately as 'the gunshine state,' as part of a military family with four brothers. Most of friends are military too, she says; which helps keep Bunny sharp with 'up-to-date tactics.'

Packing heat: 'I see my make-up and clothes as kind of like camouflage,' she explains. 'People let their guard down and I let them think I’m stupid if I want'

Suspicious: Bunny is very concerned that the government is attempting to ban guns, which she points out are essential to protecting ourselves from a 'political uprising'

She appears to be rigorously preparing for some sort of catastrophic national disaster, admitting on her website that she has read Chinese warfare bible 'The Art of War' from cover to cover 'countless times.'

'I want to show women that you don’t have to act like a slut to get ahead'

'The right to bear arms - it says right there in the constitution that it's in case of a political uprise from the government,' she tells bTV earnestly. 'I feel that a lot of the laws that have been passed or are trying to be passed have to do with that. The government is trying to strip us of our arms.'

And they'll have a tough time wrenching the guns out of this feisty bombshell's steely grip.

Ooh shiny! Most of Bunny's friends are also in the military; which helps keep her sharp with 'up-to-date tactics,' pictured caressing weaponry (left) and with her mom (right)

'I may look like a Barbie doll, but that’s just ONE of the weapons in my arsenal!' she proclaims on her website, Bunny Hunter. 'This God-fearing, patriotic country girl is striving to help restore this once proud land back to that which was originally envisioned by our Founding Fathers.'

Bunny shot her first gun when she eight years old, and it was love at first bang. 'I was just elated,' she recalls. 'I couldn't have been happier.'

Now not a week goes by when she doesn't go shooting, and claims she'll take the woods over the mall 'any day.'

The self-described 'radical right wing extremist' is a relative newcomer to the social media world, but that's understandable given her firm stand against 'electronics.' She joined Instagram and started uploading videos to her YouTube channel last year.

'I am intent on exposing more women to my passion'

Her most popular video so far is entitled 'Bunny Hunter shoots a 50 cal sniper rifle indoors,' which she does wearing platform heels and a sexy secretary outfit of sorts, and has garnered almost 60,000 views.

'I am intent on exposing more women to my passion,' she states. 'The results will be two fold. Safer females and happier relationships.'

Pow: Bunny has been single for six years, and says she's looking for 'a man who can handle a firearm'

'Every man wants a women with whom he can share the love of the outdoors. The family that plays together, stays together.'

And of her own love life? Bunny has been single for six years, perhaps because of the drought of men she deems suitable.

'These days men don’t act like men,' she laments. 'I want a man who is able to fix things with his hands and isn’t afraid to get dirty. Metrosexuals do nothing for me - I want a man who can handle a firearm.'
