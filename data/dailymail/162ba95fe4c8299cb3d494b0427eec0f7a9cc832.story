A female canoeist who got into difficulties on New Year's Day has died in hospital, police said today.

Catherine Stainsby, 41, was part of a group canoeing on the River Rawthey at Hobdale Beck, near Sedbergh, Cumbria, when the alarm was raised.

Mrs Stainsby, from Swinton, near Malton, North Yorkshire, was rescued from the water and taken to Preston Royal Infirmary by air ambulance at around 3pm on Sunday.

All of the other canoeists were safe and well.

A Cumbria Constabulary spokeswoman said Mrs Stainsby died in hospital yesterday.

She added: 'The details have been passed on to the Preston Coroner.'

Another canoeist also died on New Year's Day after falling into a fast-flowing river in Cornwall, police said.

The man, who was on holiday with his family, was found clinging to a rock in the steep-sided gorge of the River Fowey at Golitha Falls on the southern edge of Bodmin Moor.

He was winched out by search and rescue helicopter, but died in hospital after attempts to resuscitate him failed.
