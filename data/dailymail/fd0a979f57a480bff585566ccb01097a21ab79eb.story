Devoted: Aimee West and Lee Rigby on her birthday

The fiancée of Lee Rigby condemned the BBC yesterday for giving a notorious hate preacher a platform to praise his killers.

Aimee West, 23, said it was wrong for the corporation to invite Anjem Choudary on to Radio 4’s Today programme to give his views on the soldier’s murder.

Choudary was given 12 minutes of airtime on the programme, during which he repeatedly refused to condemn the savage killing.

Miss West said: ‘I’m all for free speech, but the BBC is wrong to give such a big platform to hate preachers who are brainwashing young people and inciting such acts of horrific violence.’

She added that killers Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, are ‘not representative of Islam’.

Their Old Bailey trial was told that they believed they were avenging the deaths of Muslims in war zones including Afghanistan and Iraq.

But Miss West, a former Royal Military Policewoman, said: ‘They are cowards, not soldiers. They used a car as a weapon to attack my Lee from behind and when he was unarmed.

This was the most cowardly act. They can’t possibly compare themselves to Lee or any other British soldier.’

Adebolajo and Adebowale face dying behind bars for butchering Fusilier Rigby outside his barracks in Woolwich, South-East London, in May. Last Thursday they were convicted of his murder and are due to be sentenced next month. 

Yesterday Muslim organisations joined the growing backlash against the BBC’s decision to give Choudary the most high-profile slot on Today – shortly after the 8am news – on Friday.

They are planning to demand a meeting with director general Lord Hall to discuss the BBC’s editorial policies. Scores of listeners contacted the corporation to complain about the interview. Many more expressed their anger on Twitter and other internet forums.

Choudary is a former leading member of the banned extremist organisation Al-Muhajiroun and is credited with helping to convert Adebolajo to Islam.

During his interview, Choudary 
repeatedly refused to condemn the killing, insisting David Cameron and 
British foreign policy were to blame for the soldier’s death.

A young mother told yesterday how Michael Adebolajo raped her when she was only 14.

The victim, now in her 20s, said he encouraged her to smoke super-strength cannabis, which made her pass out.

When she came round, Adebolajo was raping her as a friend watched. She got away after pleading with him to let her go.

The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, did not tell the police or her parents at the time because she felt too ashamed.

The attack took place in Romford, Essex, in 2001, when Adebolajo was 16. They lived near each other.

Describing the attack, she told the Sunday Mirror: ‘I have looked in his eyes and seen the evil inside him.

‘I opened my eyes and his face was less than an inch from mine. His teeth were discoloured and wonky. His eyes seemed to be burning.

'He smirked and his breath smelt foul and was hot on my face.’

He added that he was ‘very proud’ of 
Adebolajo as ‘a practising Muslim and a family man’, but ‘differed’ with
 him about the interpretation of Islam which he used to justify the 
murder.

Julie Siddiqi, executive director of the Islamic Society of Britain, said: ‘It [the Today appearance] was a massive error of judgment and it does so much damage. Why him? He has no legitimacy in the Muslim community.

‘We need to understand how this was 
allowed to happen. We need to articulate to the BBC the anger and 
disappointment that he was given this platform.’

Choudary pulled out of an interview with the BBC’s Panorama programme, which had gathered evidence of his close and recent links Adebolajo. But he was not asked about this on Today.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We carried a wide range of views from across the political and religious spectrums [following the Woolwich murder].

‘We believe it is important to reflect the fact that such opinions exist and feel that Choudary’s comments may offer some insight into how this crime came about.

‘His views were robustly challenged by both the presenter, John Humphrys, and by Lord Carlile, the Government’s former anti-terrorism adviser.’
