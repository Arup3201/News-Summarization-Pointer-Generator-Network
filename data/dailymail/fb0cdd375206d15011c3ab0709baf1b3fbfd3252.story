Authorities are hunting for a veteran firefighter believed by investigators to have stabbed his nearly-30-years-younger fiancée to death because she planned to leave him.

Sarah Douglas, 26, is said by cops to have been killed early Thursday morning by Orville ‘Moe’ Fleming, 55, in the suburban Sacramento home they shared. Her butchered body was discovered by her sister.

Fleming fled the scene in his state-issued fire vehicle and has not been seen since. Authorities have not said if they have any leads on his whereabouts.

‘She died horrifically, she died violently, and she didn't have that coming,’ aunt Trina Worley told KFSN. ‘Nobody has this coming.’

The dead woman was out with her mother and sister in the hours before her death, Werly recalled, adding ‘he was waiting for her.’

Sister Stephanie Douglas was on the phone with her just before the killing likely occurred.

‘She enters the house, she comes up from behind, and on the speaker phone you could hear her say 'Oh you scared the s**t out of me.

‘And then she screams, blood curdling screams and the phone went dead, said Werly.

The concerned sister went to the home that morning and had to hop a fence to get in, the aunt explained.

‘She jumped the fence and saw blood on the patio door.’ Werly told KMAX.

Her body had multiple stab wounds with a sheet wrapped around her neck.

Loved ones grieved online as friends posted messages of support.

A family member mentioned seeing the couple over Easter weekend and wrote 'they seemed fine.'

‘Sorry to hear about what happened to your sister. She was beautiful. It hurts my heart,’ a friend posted to her sister’s Facebook page.

‘In absolute shock.... We just started hanging out again. I'm so sorry Sarah,’ wrote a friend.

Fleming is a 24-year CalFire veteran, and has even spoken to media at fire scenes in the past.

His family has hit out at Douglas, calling her a dangerous, money-hungry woman who did not love the man investigators believed killed her in a jealous fit of rage.

‘She's been calling my mom's cell phone, saying all this stuff that she wants to send someone after my family,’ a woman told KXTV.

Another Family member told KMAX that Fleming said Douglas was ‘a prostitute who owed people money.’

Douglas family dismissed those claims.

‘There's no way there was any threats or the reason he did this to her is because she was some way threatening him or his family, or that she could have someone else do that is absolutely absurd,’ Werly told KMAX.

‘No, that's ridiculous that it had to do with money. He pursued her, and she really thought she cared about him, Werly added to KFSN.

Fleming’s family has notably not called into doubt his possible involvement in her death.

The manhunt for ‘Moe’ and the investigation into Douglas’ death remain ongoing.
