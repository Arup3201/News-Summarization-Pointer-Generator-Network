Sorry Rihanna, there's a new queen of the 'selfie' - a vain Madagascan lemur.

The primate joins celebs around the world in the growing trend of taking portrait pics and posting them online.

Following in the footsteps of Kelly Brook, Miley Cyrus and Helen Flanagan, this jungle diva's holiday snaps are sure to win her a legion of fans.

Hey there: The publicity-hungry lemur gets up close and personal to the camera

Bold: Lemurs have no natural predators on Madagascar, so they have no fear of saying hi to humans. Right, the lemur stared directly into the lens, fascinated by the camera

With no natural predators on Madagascar the ringtail lemurs have the liberty to roam free and really get close to curious snappers.

The hilarious images were taken by famed wildlife photographer Simone Sbaraglia who spent the whole day chronicling the audacious lemurs.

Simone, who captured the selfies during a recent trip to the African island's Vakona Nature Reserve, said: 'The lemurs in Madagascar are extremely confident due to the absence of predators.

'Furthermore they are habituated to humans and to the guides that sometimes feed them for the benefit of the tourists.

'I
spent a whole day photographing these ringtail lemurs. They are curious
by nature and several times they came really close and held the camera 
in their hands, looking down the lens, as if trying to understand what I
was doing.

'It was so funny that I kept photographing them until night came.'
