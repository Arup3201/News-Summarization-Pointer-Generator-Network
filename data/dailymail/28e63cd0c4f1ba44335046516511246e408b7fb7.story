A 17-year-old girl has died from suspected organ failure two days after going to hospital complaining of shortness of breath.

Maria Titley from Port Talbot, South Wales, had told friends she thought she was suffering from a cough or cold before the sudden tragedy.

Close friend Shaunagh Slattery, 17, said Maria had been due to go out last Saturday night with her girl friends but decided to stay at home because she was feeling unwell.

After going for a check-up at Port Talbot hospital in Neath she was rushed for emergency treatment at the Prince of Wales hospital in Bridgend.

Doctors battled for two days to try and save Maria but sadly she passed away on Tuesday morning.

Sudden: Maria Titley, 17, died on Tuesday after going to hospital complaining of shortness of breath

Miss Slattery said: 'We were all going out on Saturday but Maria said didn't feel well enough to make it.

'She just had bad breathing and chest pains for a few days - she was going to try and shake it off.

'She thought it was something normal, just a chest infection, she phoned up the hospital and went along to get some help with her breathing.

'It just happened so suddenly, no one ever expected this, it's really upsetting how someone can go so quickly.

'It just shows you should cherish the time you have because you never know what's around the corner.'

A talented hockey and netball player, Maria had told friends she felt unwell for around a week.

Miss Slattery added: 'She was such a funny girl, she would brighten up everyone's day.
