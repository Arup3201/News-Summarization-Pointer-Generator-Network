Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson is bidding to take over cancer and end of life care on the NHS in a privatisation deal worth more than £1.2 billion, it emerged today.

The tycoon is looking to secure a controversial £689 million contract to provide treatment for terminally ill patients at four NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs).

It will be the first time cancer care in the NHS has ever been privatised and the move has been described as the health service's biggest ever outsourcing of resources.

The deal would see the private sector delivering all cancer and end-of-life treatment for children and adults across Staffordshire and Stoke on Trent.

On Wednesday the four CCGs involved - which care for more than 767,000 patients - announced which organisations have pre-qualified for the 10-year contracts.

Five bidders, including Sir Richard's Virgin Care Ltd, have now been short-listed for cancer care-while seven companies, including Virgin Care Ltd, are in the running for end-of-life services.

The University Hospitals of North Midlands and The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trusts are the only public sector bodies still bidding for the contracts.

IT firm CSC Computer Sciences Ltd, private health provider United Health UK and PFI specialists Interserve Investments have also made the short list.

Critics of the move have branded it the 'biggest privatisation in NHS history' and fear it will result in private health providers putting profits before patient care.

Gail Gregory, from campaign group Cancer Not For Profit, said: 'I'm actually surprised that there are any public sector organisations on the short-lists at all. beleaguered'The fact there are so many private companies on the lists comes as no surprise, and does confirm our worst fears.

'You have to ask how qualified these companies are to run cancer and end-of-life care, especially as this will be a 10-year contract with no break clause.

'We'd prefer it if these contracts were not awarded at all..'

More than 11,000 people have signed petitions against the 'transformation' process.

Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison, also expressed concerns about the plans.

She said: 'This is by far the biggest procurement process in the NHS and is a dangerous experiment.

'We are talking about £1bn of taxpayers' money and contracts lasting 10 years in vital cancer services and end-of-life care.

'CCGs are potentially handing over all decision-making on cancer and end-of-life care to private companies.

'This is much bigger than just asking private companies to provide a service: this is asking them to design the whole system.

'With profit as the main driving force, how can it not lead to problems?'

But the CCGs insist the move is needed in order to ensure NHS services are co-ordinated properly.

Andy Donald, chief officer for Stafford and Surrounds and Cannock Chase CCGs, said: 'Our aim is to deliver the best possible cancer and end-of-life care for patients in Staffordshire so today's announcement represents a significant milestone for our programme.

'We will be continuing to listen and gather feedback from our communities to ensure we reach our goal of delivering care that is among the best in Europe right here in Staffordshire.'

Pre-qualification was the first stage in a procurement process which will run until next summer 2015, and no contracts will be agreed before the next May's General Election

Earlier this year a spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: 'The key thing is that patients get the best possible care, free at the point of use, no matter who provides it.'

A spokesman for Virgin Care said they were unable to comment on any 'ongoing potential procurements' but added: 'We have been providing care to NHS patients for over eight years.

'During this time we have treated over two million people and provided better value for the NHS as well as excellent patient care.' 

Sir Richard's sprawling business empire is hard to keep track of.

He is the seventh richest British citizen. His first business venture was founding magazine Student when he was 16.

In the 1970s he opened a chain of record stores and in 1984 launched Virgin Atlantic Airways. In September 2004, Branson announced he was launching space tourism company Virgin Galactic.

His core business areas are travel, entertainment and lifestyle.

Among his many businesses are Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Galactic, Virgin Money, Virgin Holidays, Virgin Active, Virgin Media,Virgin Trains, Virgin Air Balloons and Virgin Music (now part of EMI).

Virgin Care Ltd, which has been shortlisted to take over cancer and end of life care, already runs more than 230 NHS and Social Care services.

Since 2006 Virgin Care has treated more than four million people.

The Virgin brand made headlines last week when a pilot was killed during a test flight of Virgin Galactic’s prototype space tourism rocket.

In 2010 Sir Richard became patron of the UK's Gordon Bennett gas balloon race, which has 16 hydrogen balloons flying across Europe.

Sir Richard has also made several world record-breaking attempts including the fastest Atlantic Crossing in 1985 and in 1991 crossing the Pacific from Japan to Arctic Canada in a hot air balloon.
