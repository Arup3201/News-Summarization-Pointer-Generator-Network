The family of 5-year-old Arianna Remy continued to fight for her custody in court this week while the granddaughter of the Red Sox announcer languished in foster care, waiting for a Massachusetts judge to decide her fate.

The child was seized by state officials after Jerry Remy's son, 34-year-old Jared Remy, was charged with stabbing to death Arianna's mother, Jennifer Martel, last August.

The 61-year-old baseball announcer and
 his wife, Phoebe, have been locked in a custody battle with Miss 
Martel's parents, Brian and Patricia Martel, and her brother and his 
wife.

In limbo: Arianna Remy, 5, pictured here with her now-late mother, Jennifer Martel, has been in foster care since August

On Wednesday, the lawyers representing the two warring families appeared in court to make their case in a closed-door hearing at Middlesex Probate and Family Court, The Boston Herald reported.

A spokesperson for the Department of Children and Families said that both sets of grandparents have been visiting Arianna in foster care on a regular basis.

The trial in the custody case is expected to get under way March 25.

Meanwhile, Jerry Martel returned to work Sunday for the first time since his son's arrest last summer.

The 61-year-old sportscaster was back in the NESN television booth to announce the Red Sox exhibition game against the Baltimore Orioles in Fort Myers, Florida.

‘It was good to be back and do a game,’ Remy said after the Red Sox’s 8-6 victory. ‘It felt like my first game of spring training, like it always does — you know, you get all scrambled when all the guys get into the game. It was fine. It felt really good to be back.’

His son Jared Remy, 34, is accused of the murder of Miss Martel, 27, whom he allegedly pinned to the patio at their Waltham home and stabbed repeatedly in front of their 
5-year-old daughter Arianna last August.

Veteran Boston Red Sox commentator Jerry Remy, pictured on Monday, had made the difficult decision to return this season after taking a leave of absence when his son was accused of murder

Mr Remy told a press conference in January: 'Call me a bad father if you want. But I’ll be damned if my wife is not a good parent.', Boston.com reported.

The couple have three adult children Jared, Jordan and Jenna. Mr Remy offered no defense of his accused son, telling reporters: 'It’s pretty clear what is going to happen. He’s in jail. There’s no bail.'

Jared Remy's murder trial has been 
scheduled for October this year. He broke his silence during a court 
appearance last October to proclaim his 
innocence.

'No,' was Remy's blunt response when a Boston Herald reporter asked if he killed the mother of his daughter. 'That’s ridiculous.'

'How dumb would I
 have to be? I loved her, I still love her,' he said. The
 bulky 34-year-old maintains his innocence despite eyewitness accounts 
of Remy committing the murder. Police also reportedly dragged Remy from the murder scene covered in blood.

Jennifer Martel, 27, was stabbed multiple times and bled to death on August 15. Her family says she was very close to escaping the abusive relationship

Remy's daughter has been in state custody since after the murder.

'She’s in a good place. She has a dog 
to play with, which makes me happy because she loves animals. I’m hoping
 she’s going to be a veterinarian one day,' her father said.

Both Remy and Miss Marel's parents have petitioned for custody of the little girl.

He also said he has no intention of contacting his daughter while he remains behind bars.

'If
 she chooses to know me at some point and wants to see me, that’s fine. 
If she doesn’t, that’s fine, too. I just want her to be happy. I love 
her. I want her to go to high school, I want her to go to college, I 
want her to have everything in life she  deserves,' he said.

Remy also expressed regret over the pain this is causing his famous father, as well as his mother.

'They’re very good people. I wish the media would leave them alone. None of this is their fault. They don’t need to be dragged down in this, too,' he said.

At
 the time of the brutal murder, Jerry Remy said that
his ‘disgust and remorse’ were indescribable. In a statement released 
through his Twitter account, Mr Remy said he and his wife were 
‘heartbroken’ over the death of Miss Martel. 

‘Words cannot describe my wife's and my grief,’ Jerry Remy
wrote. ‘Son or not, I am at loss for words articulating my disgust and remorse
over this senseless and tragic act.’

On August 13 last year, police arrived at Jared Remy's home in the Windsor Village apartment complex
 at 9.30pm following multiple 911 calls. They found 
Martel bleeding in the fenced-in patio covered in stab wounds.

Middlesex
 Assistant District Attorney Lisa McGovern said Remy attacked Miss Martel in 
the kitchen, in the living room and on a stairway before pinning her to 
the ground of the patio where he stabbed her repeatedly.

'Great force and great effort was made by this defendant in stabbing Miss Martel over and over and over again' McGovern said, labeling the attack a 'protracted struggle'.

Remy was arrested at the scene after he held
 his hands over his head and surrendered to officers.

His clothing was 
soaked with Martel's blood and, according to WBZ-TV, he had an 
engagement ring in a sunglasses case in his pocket.

Just
 feet away lay Miss Martel's body, shirtless and covered in blood with stab 
wounds to her front left shoulder area as well as wounds to her neck. A 
blue cloth covered her face.

'There
 was a substantial amount of blood on the ground surrounding the 
victim's head and upper torso area,' police said. 'Martel was 
motionless, not breathing.'

Remy, who in 2005 
admitted beating up a former girlfriend, appeared in Waltham District 
Court just days before the murder on a domestic assault charge against Miss Martel. He was released without bail.

History: Remy was released from jail for assaulting Martel just two days before her murder

Martel's mother told The Boston Herald that her daughter had been 'planning her escape' when she was allegedly murdered by her long-time boyfriend.

'She
 said, "I was planning my escape,"' Patty Martel, 53, said. 'This was on
 Wednesday. She said, "Don’t worry, I’m planning my escape."'

Patty Martel said her daughter had returned to her apartment to get her belongings before fleeing.

At least one 
neighbor, Benjamin Ray, in the apartment complex rushed to Martel's aid 
and tried to pull Remy off her. But he was driven back when Remy waved 
his knife in Ray's direction, McGovern said.

'It's not an easy thing to watch. It's not an easy thing to try and stop,' Ray told Boston.com. 'I did what I could to stop it. And it wasn't enough.'

Witnesses told police they saw Remy 'on top of Miss Martel stabbing her repeatedly with the knife' on the patio.

Remy pleaded not guilty and 
has been ordered held without bail. Remy's defense attorney, Peter 
Bella, did not contest the bail order.

Police found Miss Martel dying from multiple stab wounds at the Windsor Village apartment complex in Waltham, Massachusetts last summer

Remy has maintained his innocence in the brutal murder of his girlfriend last year

Patty Martel described her daughter as 'an excellent, loving mother' to her daughter Arianna.

'She
 had so much to look forward to in her life,' she said. 'She planned on 
getting married, but she broke it off and told me she was never going to
 marry him. ... In the last few years my daughter wasn't happy. He would
 do anything and everything to keep them away from us. It got worse in 
the last few months but she never told me it was to the point where it 
was this.'

She said she was determined to take custody of her granddaughter.

'I
 don't want him to get his hands on her. If he gets out that's the first
 thing he's going to do is try to get her. He just traumatized his 
daughter for the rest of her life.'.

In 2009, Remy, then a security guard 
for the Red Sox, and a colleague were accused of using steroids. He was 
fired after he admitted using the performance-enhancing drug, but he 
denied supplying steroids to his coworker.
