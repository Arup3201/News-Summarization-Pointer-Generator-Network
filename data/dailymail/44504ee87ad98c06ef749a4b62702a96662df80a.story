The strong pound compared to the euro means now is the time for Britons to bag a bargain break as prices at popular resorts such as Portugal's Algarve plummet.

Costs at European resorts even compare favourably to six years ago when the sterling and euro reached parity, while sales in euros are also skyrocketing as the currency drops to a decade low.

A basket of typical holiday items in the Algarve is now 50 per cent cheaper than it was in January 2009, reveals new research by Post Office Travel Money.

But it's not all good news for our hip pockets abroad - prices in holiday hotspots such as Thailand have risen significantly in destinations such as Thailand and Dubai. 

The study looked at costs across  20 popular resort destinations for items such as a three-course dinner for two plus wine, sun cream and cigarettes with the package setting travellers back £32.67 in the Algarve - in January 2009 the same items were  £65.

Coming in the next lowest in price was Sunny Beach in Bulgaria, where the same set of what some would consider essentials were £32.69, which is a 39 per cent less than the 2009 price. 

Spain's Costa del Sol (£33.64), Bali (£35.30) and Crete (£37) were also sun escapes that offer good value for tourists once there.

Next lowest in price is Sunny Beach in Bulgaria where cost of everyday items are down 39 per cent on 2009

However it's not all good news for the British tourist's hip pocket as costs skyrocket in destinations outside the eurozone, where a pound is worth €1.346, and not so close to home.

Changing pounds into local currency in the USA, the Caribbean, Dubai and Thailand, Brits can  receive up to £39 less than more favourable exchanges. 

In the survey of everyday items, Dubai is the dearest with the same set of goods and services costing up to £135.35, 80 per cent up on 2009, mainly due to the high price of going out for dinner.

St James in Barbados (£99.76) is the next priciest in the survey but that is still a drop on 2009 by 34 per cent. 'There is no doubt that UK tourists can look forward to getting more travel cash for their pounds this year in Europe but people planning trips further afield could get caught out by falling rates for sterling in some countries,' Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said.

'The best way to avoid this is to consider a holiday swap to a resort where the pound still stretches further and check to see how prices for meals and drinks compare in a range of destinations.'

Potential swaps include heading to Mexico instead of the Dominican Republic, Jamaica in place of Barbados, Egypt rather than Dubai or Indonesia's Bali instead of Thailand. Or nearby, head to Portugal for a 20 per cent cheaper holiday that you'd get in non-euro Turkey.

The RAC Foundation added that UK drivers heading for the continent during the school half-term holiday would also benefit from plunging petrol prices in Europe.

Diesel is as low as 80p a litre in Austria and 83p a litre in France and Spain. Petrol costs just 86p a litre in Austria and Spain, is 92p a litre in France and 96p a litre in Germany.

RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: 'It's a case of happy holidays for the tens of thousands of Brits who will be driving on the continent this half-term.

'The low fuel prices seen in the UK are being eclipsed by those across Europe. Motorists might be tempted to fill up before they cross the Channel but thanks to the strong pound they might be better off waiting until they get off the boat in places like Calais.'
