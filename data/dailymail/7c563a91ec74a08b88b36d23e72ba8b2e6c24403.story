A paedophile pardoned by the king of Morocco after being convicted of raping 11 children has been re-arrested, this time in Spain.

Daniel Galvan Vina, who was serving a 30-year sentence, was held in the Spanish city of Murcia and will appear before the National Court in Madrid.

Galvan was on a list of 30 Spanish prisoners in Morocco that Madrid had asked to be transferred to Spain. Morocco included him among 48 Spanish prisoners pardoned and freed in late July.

Morocco's king later withdrew the 
pardon after a spate of protests - the first time in recent memory that a
sovereign has done so.

King Mohammed VI said he had asked 
his justice minister to work with his Spanish counterpart to see how the
pardon could be undone in what he described as 'an exceptional 
reversal'.

He also ordered an investigation into the pardons process.

The decision was made 'considering 
the flaws that marred the process, the gravity of the crimes committed 
and with respect to the rights of the victims', he said.

Hundreds of peaceful demonstrators gathered on Friday to rally against the pardon, in a rare protest against the king.

The demonstration was broken up by police with clubs, leaving at least 63 people injured.

The decision also prompted a frenzy 
of angry postings on social media in Morocco. Activists from the 
February 20 movement also called for Friday's rally in the Moroccan 
capital.

'The king's pardon is a second rape for the victims,' a woman identifying herself as Meryem El said on Twitter.

Hamid
Krayri, a lawyer for families of the victims, named the paedophile as 
Daniel Fino Galvan and said he had been convicted 18 months ago by 
criminal courts in Kenitra, near Rabat, of raping and filming children 
aged between 4 and 15.

'He
is a retired Spaniard who owns two flats here in Kenitra,' Krayri, who 
is a member of Morocco's Human Rights Association, told Reuters. He said
he had filed a complaint against Galvan three years ago when activists 
had shown him video discs containing footage of the Spaniard and his 
victims.

Galvan's lawyer, Mohamed Benjeddo, said his client had been freed on Wednesday and planned to leave for Spain the next day. The Spanish embassy declined to confirm Galvan's release.

The palace and the government made no immediate comment.

The king, like other Middle Eastern rulers, often pardons prisoners on special occasions, such as Throne Day on July 30, but the decision to release the Spaniards at the request of the monarch of a former colonial power has riled many in Morocco.

'Is this Morocco's way to reach the long-sought target of 10 million tourists a year?' asked blogger Nouhad Fathi in a sarcastic post on her Facebook wall.
