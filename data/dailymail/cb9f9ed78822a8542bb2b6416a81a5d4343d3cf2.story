Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York are living the high life at their campsite as they enjoy gourmet food prepared by a former hotel chef.

But across the U.S. in California, police are threatening to close down the Occupy Oakland camp because of rats, alcohol and drug use on site.

Thousands of Americans have joined in with nationwide protests against the economic situation as police face a tough job keeping them all in order.

Eating well: Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York are living the high life at their camp as they enjoy gourmet foods prepared by a former hotel chef

Working hard: The food is prepared in Brooklyn at a space donated by Overcoming Love Ministries and the food is served at the camp from 7pm

Menu: They have enjoyed salmon cakes with dill sauce and quinoa salad - along with a tomato salad with fennel and red onion, and different kinds of soup

In charge: Former Sheraton chef Eric Smith told the New York Post the team are 'running a five-star restaurant down there'

Protesters are eating well in New York. Former Sheraton chef Eric Smith told the New York Post: ‘We’re running a five-star restaurant down there.'

They have enjoyed salmon cakes with dill 
sauce and quinoa salad - along with a tomato salad with fennel and red 
onion, and different kinds of soup.

The chef, who is cooking meals from a soup kitchen in Brooklyn for more than 1,000 protesters, is using organic meats, reported the New York Post.

On Tuesday night they enjoyed organic chicken, spaghetti bolognese, roasted beet and sheep’s milk-cheese salad and wild heirloom potatoes.

Many of the ingredients have been donated by small organic farms in upstate New York, as well as Vermont and Connecticut.

The food is prepared at a space donated by Overcoming Love Ministries and the food is served at the camp from 7pm, reported the New York Post.

Camp problems: There are growing reports of graffiti, vandalism and public urination at Occupy Oakland, officials said

City issues: In Oakland, California, a pre-existing rat problem in a city plaza has increased because of the protesters camping out there

But over in Oakland, California, a pre-existing rat problem in a city plaza has increased because of the protesters camping out there.

City officials are urging demonstrators 
to store food properly after complaints from local business and workers -
and even the protesters.

'Basically, it's not legal for them to camp - we're accommodating it. And we've been telling them, we reserve the right to change our minds at any time'

Oakland city administrator spokesman

There are also growing reports of illegal drug use, alcohol abuse, fighting, and sexual harassment on the site, a city spokesman told the Oakland Tribune.

‘It's not legal for them to camp - we're accommodating it,’ the spokesman said. ‘And we've been telling them, we reserve the right to change our minds at any time.'

The Oakland site is much smaller than the New York camp - with only around 100 tents compared to the 1,000 people camped out in Manhattan.

City officials are also worried about graffiti, vandalism and public urination despite the presence of portable toilets, reported the Oakland Tribune.
