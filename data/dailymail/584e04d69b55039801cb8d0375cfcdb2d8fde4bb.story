British duo Lawrence Okoye and Jack Crawford have both been cut by their respective NFL franchises - San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders - as teams make their final roster moves ahead of the season.

Former discus thrower Okoye was one of 19 players cut by the 49ers as they named their final 53-man roster while the Crawford was cut by the Raiders. 

Oakland, the team who Manchester born Menelik Watson plays for, will face the Miami Dolphins in the first of three International Series games taking place at Wembley this season.

Okoye swapped discus for American football after representing Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympic Games.

The 22-year-old was placed on the injured reserve list last season by the 49ers after sustaining a knee injury.

Okoye travelled with the 49ers to London last October when they took on the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley and spoke of his desire to break into the San Francisco roster this season.

But the Croydon-born man missed out on a place in the 49ers' final 53-man roster for the new season, which begins on Thursday when the Seattle Seahawks take on the Green Bay Packers.
