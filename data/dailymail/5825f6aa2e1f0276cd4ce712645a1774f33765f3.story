Women who feel threatened by their photographs being taken on the Tube for a Facebook blog about women eating on the London Underground, have been told to contact police.

The group entitled Women Who Eat On Tubes invites commuters to upload pictures of strangers caught eating in public.

They are asked to provide information including what the person was eating, what time the photo was taken and on what line.

The page states the page is 'observational not judgemental' adding it 'doesn't intimidate or bully'

The page said it is 'observational not judgemental' adding that it 'doesn't intimidate or bully'.

A statement on the page, which has more than 14,000 members, adds: 'Subjects are embraced and cherished.

'We celebrate and encourage women eating food on tubes, we do not marginalise them. We always look for the story in the picture. We don't swear.'

While the MailOnline has made attempts to conceal the identities of the women in the photographs, they appear on the group page without any alterations.

Transport for London said while taking photographs of people on the Tube is not illegal, those that feel threatened should contact the British Transport Police.

Steve Burton TfL's Director of Enforcement and On-Street Operations, said: 'Taking photos on the Tube isn’t illegal, but we ask anyone doing so to ensure that they use common sense and respect for other passengers.

'If someone doesn’t want their photo taken it is obviously inappropriate to do so.

'If any customer has concerns about such behaviour, believing there may be a sinister motive, they are advised to speak to our staff or the British Transport Police.'

Privacy campaign Big Brother Watch called for the law to be changed to deter people from taking secret photos in cases where they intend to publish them

Privacy campaign Big Brother Watch called for the law to be changed to deter people from taking photos of strangers in cases where they intend to publish them.

Deputy Director Emma Carr, said: 'The laws protecting our privacy were written long before social media, camera phones and widespread broadband access.

'Cases like this should be dealt with proportionately, and people absolutely need to be able to seek redress if they do not wish to have their photograph on this kind of website.

'Unfortunately this is a problem that will get worse before it gets dealt with.

'It’s obviously not realistic to expect social networks to police whether photographs have been taken with consent, but there is clearly a need to look at where people are creating forums to encourage and share photos taken.

'Equally banning camera phones isn’t going to work, so we need to make sure that the law deters people taking photos of other people, especially if their intent is to publish them.'
