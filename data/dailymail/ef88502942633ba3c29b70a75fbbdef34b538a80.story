Two 13-year-old girls have been taken to hospital and a further 22 are being treated  for shock after a suspected lightning strike at a Sydney high school.

Paramedics were called to Clancy Catholic College at West Hoxton, south west of Sydney, about 9.30am this morning. 

Some students reportedly had symptoms of headaches and dizziness following the lightning strike, while others said they had felt numbness in their limbs.

A NSW Ambulance spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia two students were taken to Fairfield Hospital to be treated.

Paramedics were called to Clancy Catholic College at West Hoxton, south west of Sydney, before 10am on Tuesday

Some students reportedly had symptoms of headaches and dizziness following the lightning strike, while others said they had felt numbness in their limbs 

The class of students were on the school oval during an electrical storm when a loud clap of thunder was heard.

Students ran for cover minutes later complaining of headaches, the Daily Telegraph reports. 

Witnesses had reported thunder at the time, but the spokeswoman said it was 'hard to ascertain whether there had actually been a lightning strike' or if it was a 'static electricity discharge'.

Four ambulances rushed to the school and it's understood a triage was set up to assess students. 

'It looks like no one was directly hit,' a police spokeswoman told Nine News.

About 20 parents rushed to the high school after news of the lightning strike.

There was an announcement over the school's PA system at 10.30am to say all students were well.

A meterologist for WeatherZone, Rob Sharpe, said there were several lightening strikes in the area around the time the students reported feeling sick.

'It's entirely plausible that lightning did strike (the oval),' Mr Sharpe told the Sydney Morning Herald.
