Glenn Whelan has been ruled out for up to six weeks with a broken leg.

The Stoke City midfielder was injured during Ireland’s 1-1 draw with Germany and will miss his country’s next Euro 2016 qualifier against Scotland on November 14.

He is also expected to be absent for at least six Stoke fixtures, and will face a race against time to be fit for consecutive matches against Manchester United and Arsenal at the start of December.

‘Glenn has a fracture in his leg,’ said manager Mark Hughes. ‘He got it in the international game, got a kick on the outside of his leg.

‘He’s not been put into plaster cast but we’re going to try and manage without that and Glenn feels he’ll be back sooner.

‘The likeliehood is he will be out for four to six weeks I’d imagine, which is a blow for Glenn because he is a big part of what we’re doing and we’ll miss him. But we have got options.

Whelan sustained the injury in action for Ireland, in their 1-1 draw against World Cup winners Germany

‘He’s been playing really well of late. We’ll get him back as soon as week can.

‘You have to let nature take its course. When you’re talking about fractures you have to give them enough time to recover unfortunately.’
