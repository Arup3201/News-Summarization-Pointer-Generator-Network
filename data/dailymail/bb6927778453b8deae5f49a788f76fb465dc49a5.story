Two Canadian transgender performers have been banned from flying by Canada's largest airline after one of them took off her clothes in a mid-air strip show.

Lexi Sanfino, who was travelling with friend Nina Arsenault, took off her top and walked up the plane's aisle before being tackled by staff and ordered to cover up.

The artist said she went topless in protest at offensive questioning by flight attendants about whether she used to be a man.

Nina Arsenault claims her friend stripped after staff asked if they used to be men and how do make-up

The pair were arrested last month when their WestJet flight landed in Edmonton, Canada.

They say they have now been banned from flying with WestJet of Air Canada.

However, Ms Sanfino said she only took her top off because air hostesses began asking inappropriate questions.

Ms Arsenault, 39,  from Toronto, said her friend walked down 
the aisle with her arms out but was immediately covered up by staff who 
said 'Think about the children'.

She told Canada's Toronto Star: 'She came over and said, "You guys have to teach us how to do our makeup".

'And then they were like, "You know, because you used to be guys, right?"'

Ms Sanfino was charged with causing a disturbance, while her friend was released without charge, according to Canadian reports.

Ms Sanfino said: 'I guess we're banned from flying, or at least my breasts are - maybe I'll get them removed if they're causing all these problems.'

Sanfino said the strip on the WestJet flight was in protest at questioning by staff about her gender

The pair say they have also been banned from flying with Air Canada - the country's biggest airline

Both are prominent campaigners from transsexual rights and Ms Arsenault is a well-known in Canada as a columnist, artist and sex worker.

She is best known for her one-woman stage show called The SiliconeDiaries.

The pair claim police threatened to put them in a male-only jail and referred to them as men, which is what is stated on their passports.

Ms Arsenault told Toronto Star: 'Let’s face it: if you’re legally male, it’s not even illegal to remove 
your top.

'I think that was the politics she was 
exposing. If you’re going to treat me like a male, then I’ll put this in
your face. Which begs the question: now am I?'

WestJet confirmed the pair were banned from travelling with them and Air Canada declined to comment, according to the Nine MSN.
