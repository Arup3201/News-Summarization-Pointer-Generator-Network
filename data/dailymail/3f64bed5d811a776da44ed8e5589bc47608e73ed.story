Our great-grandparents would never have heard of most of them, but to us they're familiar parts of everyday life.

Swedish furniture store IKEA, Australian pop idol, Kylie, and the American TV series Friends are among Britain's best-loved foreign imports, alongside Chinese takeaways, spaghetti bolognese, and fajitas.

But our most favourite import is one many of use several times a day.Â  Search engine Google, designed and based in California, tops a new list of Britain's 50 favourite imports.

Favourite import of all: The controversial, California-based internet search giant comes top of the list

The research shows that Disney, Facebook and Samsung are now among our favourite international brands, while Apple's iPhone finished below Samsung in the Top 50 list in 12th position

Fajitas, croissants and spaghetti bolognese also made the top ten, showing the way to our hearts is often through their our stomach.

The research, commissioned by international food company Santa Maria, found 27 of the top 50 people, places and brands British people have adopted as their own are food-related.

Our love of imported TV shows is also clear, with Friends, Sex and the City and Breaking Bad featuring high on the list.

The study, which polled 2,000 people, found one in five currently watch more American TV shows than British.

And in a typical week we are also more likely to eat meals that originated overseas than we are to eat British classics like fish and chips or shepherd's pie.

American TV show Friends, starring Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, Jennifer Aniston and Courtney Cox is 14th

Second on the list: Chinese food was beaten only by Google in its place in British people's affections

Male imports: George Clooney and Brad Pitt came 35th and 46th favourite on the Top 50 list respectively

Male pin-ups George Clooney and Brad Pitt are favourites, while Kylie Minogue is the only female celebrity to make the top 50.

American Quentin Tarantino's stylish movies see him included in the list, alongside Disney, Marvel Comics, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel scent.

Taste psychologist, Greg Tucker said: 'The UK is actually very open to acquiring, and making their own, a whole range of foreign influences.

'The growing love for things such as Chinese, Mexican and Caribbean food means they have become integrated into the British psyche and way of life.

'What was foreign to previous generations is fast becoming a part of life in 21st century Britain.'
