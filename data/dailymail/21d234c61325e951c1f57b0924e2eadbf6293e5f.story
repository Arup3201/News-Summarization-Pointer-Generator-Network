There was chaos at a flagship McDonald’s in Chicago in the early hours of Saturday when a mass brawl broke out.

The Rock N Roll McDonald's is one of the fast food chain's most famous locations in the world and a popular tourist attraction in the city.

The violent incident was captured on cell phone footage which was later posted on YouTube.

Chicago Police News Affairs Officer Hector Alfaro confirmed that police were called about 1 a.m. to the incident, reports The Chicago SunTimes.

But police haven’t reviewed the video because 'there was minor property damage and no injuries reported, so there is no further ongoing investigation,' Alfaro said.

An unspecified number of people involved in the fight ran away before officers arrived.

No injuries were reported, however, the restaurant did file a criminal damage report for glass that was broken during the altercation.

The rock'n'roll-themed restaurant has a maximum occupancy of 300, which is about three times the standard capacity of a McDonald's.

Attached to the restaurant is a rock and roll memorabilia exhibit. The building also features the first two-lane McDonald's drive-through, relatively luxurious decor, a café, plasma display flat screen televisions and a green roof.
