Former Culture Secretary Maria Miller said more needed to be done to tackle the 'epidemic' of consensual 'sexting' between children

A law banning 'revenge porn' should be accompanied by a crackdown on teenagers trading naked pictures, former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller has said.

She welcomed plans to make the malicious distribution of private sexual images a specific offence for the first time – but said more needed to be done to tackle the 'epidemic' of consensual 'sexting' between children as young as ten.

Approximately four in ten children regularly swap sexual images on services such as Snapchat and Whatsapp.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling will today announce that under new rules in the Criminal Justice Bill going through the House of Lords, those who share images of 'people engaged in sexual activity or depicted in a sexual way'– without their consent – will face up to two years in prison.

However, the new rules will not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages. 

Mrs Miller, who resigned as Culture Secretary earlier this year, said schools could be obliged to raise the issue in class. 

She said: 'We need to ram home the message to young people that it is illegal, and should not be regarded as normal behaviour.'

It was claimed yesterday that thousands of nude Snapchat messages had been hacked and posted online. Half of Snapchat users are between 13 and 17, and many of the leaked images could be of underage children.

Mr Grayling's move on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions.

The vast majority of victims are female, such as Hannah Thompson, who was labelled a 'whore' on naked pictures placed on the Tumblr site by an ex-lover. The popstar Tulisa Contostavlos was also burned by the spiteful craze when a former boyfriend released a video of her performing a sex act.

Mr Grayling said: 'We want those who fall victim to this type of disgusting behaviour to know that we are on their side and will do everything we can to bring offenders to justice.'
