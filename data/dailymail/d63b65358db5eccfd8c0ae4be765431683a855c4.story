West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has ordered Andy Carroll not to rest on his laurels after scoring twice against Swansea City and  told the striker: 'You're not there yet, son!'

Carroll's brace in the 3-1 win at Upton Park temporarily lifted West Ham to third in the Barclays Premier League - their highest position since September 1999 - before Manchester United beat Southampton the day after at St Mary's.

But Allardyce feels the 25-year-old must continue to improve his fitness after his time at the East London club was interrupted by injuries.

'The two goals against Swansea are great for Andy but now he has to get even fitter, do even more training - not less,' Allardyce told the Evening Standard.

'He must not get complacent and I would say: "You're not there yet son, make sure you continue to improve and the only way you'll do that is continue to work hard after the deserved rest all the lads will have after three tough games in a short period of time".

'After that, though, it will be back to hard graft on the training ground, in the gym and keeping himself as fit as possible.'

Alex Song is another producing plenty for West Ham, having settled quickly since joining on a season-long loan from Barcelona.

Sources close to the midfielder have told Sportsmail he is 'very happy' with the Hammers and there remains ‘a chance’ he could stay for longer.

Allardyce has been delighted with Song's return from injury, and hailed the former Arsenal man.

'He controls the midfield. He's composed, he's cool - he's going to be awesome when he is fully match fit again,' he said. 'It was a big bonus against Swansea to have him back. 

'It helped make us better in possession of the ball and made us much more creative. Alex and Stewart Downing were terrific in the diamond shape.

'In final-third areas we score so many goals because of the quality of our delivery from Stewart, Aaron Cresswell and Carl Jenkinson.'

Enner Valencia found himself substituted at half-time by Diafra Sakho, and Allardyce explained why.

'Enner was disappointed but it was the right thing to do,' he continued. 'He'll be back but Diafra's second-half partnership with Andy was very encouraging.'
