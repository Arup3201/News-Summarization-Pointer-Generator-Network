During an impromptu Twitter Q&A a few days ago, Petr Cech began reminiscing about his first Chelsea game way back in 2004.

‘I cannot forget my first game against United and everyone was shouting “Carlo, Carlo” (Cudicini) and was not happy I play.’

That game, against Manchester United on August 15, was Cech’s debut and he kept a clean sheet, as he has done 158 times in the Barclays Premier League since his arrival from Rennes a decade ago.

Incidentally, Cech is a man of such integrity that he even pointed out during the Q&A that the often-quoted figure of 161 clean sheets is inaccurate because he doesn’t count the three games when he has been substituted with an injury.

That gives an insight into his nature and his drive. It is no surprise he was behind the best defence in the Premier League last season. They conceded just 27 goals.

Manuel Neuer, widely regarded as the best keeper in the world, conceded 23 as Bayern Munich romped to the Bundesliga title.

In Spain, where Thibaut Courtois kept goal for Atletico Madrid in their title-winning season, the Belgian conceded only 26.

Courtois cannot be ignored after the decision was taken to finally bring the 22-year-old keeper back to Cobham.

Now he has returned to Chelsea after three years on loan at the Vicente Calderon, Cech’s prospects look bleak.

The reality is that Courtois, with a La Liga title and Champions League final among his career highlights already, is Jose Mourinho’s preferred choice.

A new Chelsea team is emerging, with Courtois, Filipe Luis (who was on the bench at Turf Moor on Monday evening), Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa munching goals up front.

At 32, with three Premier League titles, the Champions League in 2012 and Europa League in 2013, much will depend on whether Cech has the stomach for the fight.

Mourinho has indicated, on a number of occasions, that he wants the Czech keeper to remain at Stamford Bridge. ‘We have two of the best keepers in the world,’ he remarked after Monday’s 3-1 victory at Turf Moor.

He is right, of course, but Cech’s next game in the first team is likely to be in the third round of the Capital One Cup on September 23 or 24.

He is a hugely popular member of the first-team squad at Chelsea and he has a special relationship with goalkeeper coach Christophe Lollichom.

The pair are often spotted out in Knightsbridge together, heading for the upscale eateries on Brompton Road or Beauchamp Place.

Lollichom, however, will have to adapt to the new set-up now that Courtois has been given the chance to be Chelsea’s first choice keeper. The Belgian is the priority now.

Last weekend QPR manager Harry Redknapp spoke of a new trend emerging, with the top teams staffing their squads with two high-end keepers. 

Manchester City brought in Willy Caballero to compete with Joe Hart over the summer; Arsenal signed Colombia keeper David Ospina from Nice to fight it out with Wojciech Szczesny; Pepe Reina has signed for Bayern Munich, but will rarely get a game; Costa Rica keeper Keylor Navas joined Real Madrid and will vie with captain Iker Casillas for a spot.

The problem is that no top keeper is ever satisfied with life on the substitutes bench.

Julio Cesar won five Serie A titles with Inter and the Champions League under Mourinho in 2010, but wasn’t willing to play second fiddle to Rob Green.

Burning £70,000 a week in wages, he spent some time in MLS with Toronto last season and joined Benfica on a two-year deal on Tuesday. 

Leaving Chelsea is an option for Cech and Mourinho will not stand in his way if he decides to go.

Chelsea’s manager hinted at some ‘offers’ after their victory at Burnley, but Cech is reluctant to accept that his days at the Bridge are over.

He is a dedicated professional, a man who never drinks alcohol and always respects the club’s code of conduct. His time-keeping is immaculate.

Like every keeper he has made mistakes throughout his career, but he remains one of the best in the business.

That’s why, on Sunday, when he travelled with the squad to Lancashire he look frustrated and fed up. He knew his fate by then.

If he decides to leave, he will be remembered as a Chelsea great.

What now? Cech is facing a future as Chelsea's Capital One Cup keeper... unless he leaves
