A male police officer has been dressing as an Amish woman hoping to scare off a man suspected of exposing himself to Amish children.

Pulaski Township Sgt. Chad Adams, 39, says Pennsylvania police weren't able to charge the man for a lack of concrete evidence. His perverted behavior came to light after a child whom the man exposed himself to remembered the suspect's license plate.

However it is believed that he's the same person sentenced to house arrest in January for similar incidents in neighboring Mercer County.

Adams, a father of two daughters, says he got help from a female officer in Wampum, a neighboring department to his own.

The Amish who live in Lawrence County, along the Ohio border, don't want their children to testify in court and agreed to lend the police women's bonnets, aprons and dresses to catch or scare away the suspect.

They walked the roads used by the Amish community each day for a few weeks in freezing temperatures hoping to catch the pervert in the act.

Sgt Adams told New Castle News: 'We figured if he was driving down the road and saw what he thought were Amish women walking he wouldn’t notice I was a guy until he got out of the vehicle.'

The officer said that putting on the Amish dress didn't bother him when catching a sexual predator was at stake.

'I didn’t care what anyone else thought. I felt this guy was pretty much a predator who was preying on kids who had no means of communication. Basically, it’s all Amish population through there,' he added.

Adams revealed the investigation now that the incidents have stopped.
