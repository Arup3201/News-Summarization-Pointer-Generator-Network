A Mexican photographer has captured the mysterious behavior of Munk's devil rays shooting into the sky.

Octavio Aburto, 41, took the stunning shots of the animals leaping more than 10 feet into the air in Cabo Pulmo National Park on Mexico's Gulf of California coast.

The photographer and conservationist looked on as the startling spectacle unfolded - where thousands of the rays swim together and burst into the air in unison.

Up in the air: Munk's devil rays, which live along the Pacific coast of Central and South America, can jump up to 10 feet above the water

Lift off: Theories suggest that the rays may jump to remove parasites or impress mates

Munk's rays, which flap their wings like birds when they leap above the sea, is one of the species of devil rays that leap out of the sea

Mr Aburto, who is an assistant professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California, said it is not known why the rays 'jump' out of the water.

Common theories include that the rays jump to remove parasites from their skin or as part of a mating ritual, though both male and female Munk's rays jump.

One theory holds that the rays leap by accident because they are moving quickly beneath the water's surface and do not realize that moving upwards will send them flying into the air.

Oceanographer Walter Munk, for whom the animals were named in the  1980s, said 'They just jump for the joy of it. Why shouldn't they jump for the joy?'

Acrobats of the sea: The rays are known for doing flips after they jettison themselves into the air and then landing flat on their bellies with a splat

The rays are about three feet in wingspan and are called 'tortilla' by local fisherman, according to Science Friday. 

The food-inspired name came from the animal's acrobatic flips while in the air, which are followed by flat landings reminiscent of the Mexican flatbread.

'They are some of the great acrobats in the marine world,' Mr Aburto said. 

Though all species of devil rays jump out of the water, Munk's rays are the only type that do so while swimming around in groups, which can be as large as 250,000.

The fish jump out of the water and flap their wings like birds regularly during mass migrations along the coast.

Known as Mobula munkiana, the sea creatures are most commonly found along in the eastern Pacific from Mexico to South America. 

'Seeing these devil rays jumping out of the water is something extraordinary,' said Mr Aburto, who has been photographing Mexico's coastal waters since 1994. 

The conservationist said that the sound of the rays hitting the water when they land creates a strange rain-like sound.

'You can wake up very early in the morning and hear the noise almost in darkness,' he said.

'Suddenly, when the sun starts coming out, all the ray silhouettes can be seen everywhere.' 

Mr Aburto said that at the jumping's peak rays can be seen leaping for several miles, and 'Sometimes the frenzy is so high that some of these animals can land on the boats.'

Though the teeming mass of Munk's rays are impressive, conservation group Red List says that the species is under threat. 

The large schools are susceptible to gillnet fishing, where nets are hung vertically to catch animals by their gills, where more than 60 Munk's devil rays can be caught in one net.
