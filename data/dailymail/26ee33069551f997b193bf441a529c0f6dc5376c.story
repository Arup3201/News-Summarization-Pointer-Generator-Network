People who multi-task the most are likely to be the worst at it, a study revealed yesterday.

Those who take on many tasks at once often wrongly believe they are good at multi-tasking - and have trouble focusing on one task at a time, researchers at Utah University in Salt Lake City said.

The U.S. professors found the motorists most likely to talk on their mobile phones while driving tend to be ‘impulsive, sensation-seeking’ individuals who have a heightened risk of having a crash.

Some people like doing two or more things at once because it is stimulating, interesting, challenging and more exciting - even if it hurts their overall performance, the findings suggest.

‘What’s alarming is people who talk on cell phones while driving tend to be the people least able to multi-task well,’ Professor David Sanbonmatsu said in his report for the PLOS ONE online journal.

‘People talking on cell phones while driving are people who probably shouldn’t. We showed people who multi-task the most are those who appear to be the least capable of multi-tasking effectively.’

He gave 310 undergraduate psychology students tests and questionnaires to measure their actual multi-tasking ability, perceived multi-tasking ability and mobile phone use while driving.

They also had to look at their use of a wide array of electronic media and personality traits such as impulsivity and sensation-seeking.

Study co-author Professor David Strayer said: ‘The people who are most likely to multi-task harbour the illusion they are better than average at it, when in fact they are no better than average - and often worse.’

Those who scored highest on actual multi-tasking ability tended not to engage in it because they were more able to focus attention on the job at hand.

Their perceived multi-tasking ability ‘was found to be significantly inflated,’ the study said. In fact, 70 per cent of participants thought they were above average at multi-tasking.

People with high levels of impulsivity and sensation-seeking reported more multi-tasking.

Those who engaged in multi-tasking often do so ‘because they are less able to block out distractions and focus on a singular task' - rather than because they have the ability.

The researchers said: ‘The negative relation between cellular communication while driving and multi-tasking ability appears to further bolster arguments for legislation limiting the use of cell phones while operating a motor vehicle.’

Professor Sanbonmatsu said the 25 per cent who performed best on multi-tasking ability ‘are the people who are least likely to multi-task and are most likely to do one thing at a time.’

The study was funded by the American Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safety.
