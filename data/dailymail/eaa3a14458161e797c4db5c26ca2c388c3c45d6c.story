A controversial Fourth of July parade float has drawn a firestorm of criticism in Nebraska.

Featured
 in Norfolk's annual Independence Day parade, the float depicts a 
figured dressed in overalls standing next to an outhouse labeled the 
'Obama Presidential Library.'

The figure, which was decorated in a greenish, zombie-like color, has its hand pressed to the sides of its head.

This controversial float in a Nebraska Independence Day parade has drawn accusations of racism

Miniature American flags topped the pick-up truck and the flatbed trailer the float road on.

Omaha reports that no sponsor was identified on the pick-up or the float.

A picture of the float, taken by Pierce, Nebraska's Liz Guthrie, went viral on social media.

Guthrie told reporters she could hear people applauding and laughing at the display as it passed.

However
 Norfolk resident Glory Kathurima, a black woman who attended the parade
 with her 9-yeard-old daughter, said she thought it was an extremely 
offensive depiction.

She later complained to the mayor along with the local chamber of commerce and the Norfolk Daily News to express her concerns.

She believed the entry went out of it's way to call the president stupid.

The float's supporters claim it was meant as a political cartoon and did not have racist meaning

The Nebraska Democratic Party later issued a statement calling the entry among the 'worst shows of 
racism and disrespect for the office of the presidency that Nebraska has
 ever seen.'

'The  City of Norfolk doesnâ€™t condone that,' Norfolk City Councilman Dick Pfeil told reporters.

However he added float approval was in the hands of the Odd Fellows. Representatives did not respond to interview requests.

Parade
 committee member Rick Konopasek said the float was only meant as a 
political cartoon and was not intended to be offensive or racist.

He added that it was among the most popular parade floats and was awarded an honorable mention by three judges.
