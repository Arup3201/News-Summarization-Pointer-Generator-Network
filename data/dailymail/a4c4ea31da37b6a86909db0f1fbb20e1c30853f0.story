Somali militants with links to al-Qaeda today posted sickening photographs of what they claim is a French soldier killed in Saturday's failed rescue mission of a fellow countryman held hostage.

Three pictures posted on Twitter show a white man wearing military pants and a blood-soaked shirt surrounded by three guns, ammunition clips and protective gear.

Militant Islamist group al-Shabab taunt the dead man's religion in their posts writing 'A return of the crusades, but the cross could not save him from the sword,’ and asking president Francois Hollande if it was 'worth it'.

Gruesome: Somali militia al-Shabab tweeted this picture, which we have pixilated out of decency, and two more of
 what they says is a soldier killed in attempt to free a French 
intelligence officer held hostage

The soldier was killed during a failed military raid to rescue a French intelligence 
officer who had been held by al-Shabab, the al-Qaida-affiliated militant group that 
controls much of southern Somalia, since July 2009.

French special forces arrived in the 
village of Bulo Marer, 50 miles from the capital Mogadishu, to free Denis Allex, 
the pseudonym for a secret agent who was captured while working for France’s overseas intelligence agency 
DGSE.

French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le 
Drian said Monday that it was likely the two commandos were killed 
during the raid. France believes Denis 
Allex, was also killed.

Mr Le Drian appeared to predict the 
release of the pictures, saying several hours before the posting that 
France believed al-Shabab was preparing a ‘macabre and disgraceful’ 
display of the dead soldiers' bodies, although only one body has been pictured so far.

Rescue bid: The soldier was killed in a failed attempt to rescue French secret agent Denis Allex, pictured in an al-Shabab video, who reportedly also died, although al-Shabab insists he is still alive

French special forces arrived in the village of Bulo Marer, 50 miles from the capital Mogadishu, in the early hours of Saturday January 12

In addition to the Twitter postings, 
al-Shabab released a longer statement that appeared to mix exaggerated 
boasts with fact. The group said that the operation resulted in the 
deaths of ‘several’ French forces and injured ‘many more.’

The militants
 said the commander leading the operation was among those wounded, and 
that al-Shabab ‘paramedic teams’ transferred him to a hospital where he 
died.

Despite French claims about Mr
 Allex being killed, al-Shabab insisted he was still alive – and had not
 even been in the village.

It was formed as a radical offshoot of the Union of Islamic Courts in 2006.

Affiliated to al-Qaeda, it controls large swathes of south and central Somalia and in 2010 it was responsible for the deaths of 76 people in a double attack in Uganda during 2010 football World Cup.

It is estimated to have 7,000 to 9,000 fighters. al-Shabab means 'The Youth' in Arabic.

The group also said a decision had 
been reached concerning the fate of Allex. It said that decision would 
be announced in coming hours.

Transported by helicopters, the French
 commandos attacked the al-Shabab position early Saturday in an attempt 
to free Allex.

Le Drian said the government decided to stage the rescue a
 month ago, when Allex's location seemed to have settled down ‘in a spot
 accessible by the sea.’

U.S. military aircraft briefly entered Somali 
airspace to support the rescue operation, President Barack Obama said 
Sunday, but did not employ their weapons.

Fierce fighting broke out after the French troops landed. French officials said they counted 17 dead among the Islamists.

Al-Shabab once controlled all of 
south-central Somali, including the capital, Mogadishu. African Union 
troops pushed al-Shabab out of the capital in 2011, but the militants 
still control wide swaths of rural southern Somalia.

The failed raid came just a few hours 
after France began a military operation in Mali to assist the government
 there against encroaching rebels linked to Al Qaeda.

However, Mr Le Drian insisted that the
 Somalia raid was nothing to do with Mali after rumour spread that the rescue mission was carried out following fears that Mr 
Allex would be executed in an act of revenge.

President Francois 
Hollande says France will raise its domestic terror threat level in 
light of events in Mali and Somalia.
