Stuart Kerner, pictured, is accused of having sex with the teenager in empty classrooms and cleaning cupboards all over their school

A pupil who has accused a married RE teacher of having sex with her is a self-confessed 'liar' who pretended she was in a car accident, a court today heard.

Stuart Kerner, 44, is accused of having sex with the teenager in empty classrooms and cleaning cupboards all over their school during an 18 month affair.

His alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is a former student at Bexleyheath Academy in south east London.

She was 15 when the affair is said to have begun. But today teachers at the school said the pupil was a 'proven liar'.

Librarian Marion King told Inner London Crown Court: 'As she got older she got very cocky and thought everybody fancied her.

'She went around saying "I can do what I like, I'm special".'

Mrs King told jurors the schoolgirl had pretended to be involved in a car accident to get out of PE classes.

She turned up to school with a bandage around her chest in the elaborate charade, the court heard. Teachers eventually discovered from her mother that there had been no accident.

Mrs King said: 'She said doctors found a problem with her heart. I said "Oh my God are you OK?"

'She said she couldn't do PE anymore. She had bandages all around her chest and said she had a tube put inside. She unwrapped her bandage and had a bloody line around three inches long.'

Mrs King said she was moved to tears by the story, but later discovered it was a lie.

She said: 'She came into my office and I said "What is going on?".

'She said: "I lie - that's what I do".

'She couldn't seem to grasp what she had done. It was shocking to me.'

Mrs King said other pupils joked that the schoolgirl 'stalked' Kerner.

She said: 'I thought Mr Kerner ought to be very wary of her. I think she had a crush on him and I said he needed to be careful because I think she has a massive crush on you.

'A couple of students commented on it. They said she is stalking him. I think she is very manipulative. She lied to me.'

When she was contacted by police, Mrs King said she thought the allegations were 'rubbish' and branded the pupil a 'psychopathic liar'.

She said: 'You have got a girl who is a proven liar saying unbelievable lies.

'I think she's a very sick girl. I think there is something wrong with her.'

PE teacher Les Ainsworth said the schoolgirl showed 'no remorse' when she was caught out lying.

He said: 'She was an attention seeker. Not only from her peers but from her teachers as well.'

He added: 'When she came into the office I found her manipulative and quite tactile.'

The PE teacher said he was told by two pupils in around May 2012 that the schoolgirl had told people she was having a relationship with Kerner.

He chose to have a word with Kerner about the claims, but did not report it higher, jurors heard.

Pressed on why he did not take the matter higher, he said: 'My decision at that time was to have a word with Stuart.'

Kerner denies the allegations.

The trial continues.
