A manhunt has been launched for a gunman who shot dead a former football player for his brand-new Dr Dre Beats headphones... then fled without even taking them.

Christian Massey, 21, was walking to a friend's house on Sunday when a mugger stopped him and demanded he hand over the $300 headset, in the Winfield area of Philadelphia.

But Massey refused and ran down an alleyway where his assailant shot him in the back five times - before the eyes of a group of children playing yards away.

Iconic: Famed for their iconic red 'b' logo, Dr Dre's 'Beats by Dr Dre' premium headphones have become have become a must-have accessory for America's youth since being launched in 2006. Priced between $150 and $400, they made Dr Dre (pictured) the world's highest earning musician last year

The unknown attacker then fled the scene empty handed, leaving the headphones, which Massey had only bought on Friday, lying in the road a few inches from his body.

'To me, he was my child,' Eula Hodge, his grandmother, told NBC Philadelphia. 'Why did they have to shoot him. They didn't get what they shot him for so he was shot for nothing.'

Murder detectives have launched an investigation into the senseless killing but, with no leads, are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

Today Twitter came alive with tributes to the former Marton Newtown Tigers receiver and lineman.

Famed for their iconic red 'b' logo, Dr Dre's 'Beats by Dr Dre' premium headphones have become a must-have accessory for America's youth since their launch in 2006.

Dr Dre has relied on endorsement by popular musicians to help sell his pricey earphones including Justin Bieber, Lady GaGa, will.i.am. and P Diddy.

Priced between $150 and $400, they made Dr Dre the world's highest earning musician last year, with a reported revenue of $110million.
