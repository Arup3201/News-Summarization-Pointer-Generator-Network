A mother walked into her 28-year-old son's bedroom to find his boyfriend's dead body wrapped in plastic on his bed, police have said.

The unnamed woman had just returned from work when she went into her son Jermaine Jackson's basement room at their home in Baltimore, Maryland, on Saturday.

There, she discovered the body of Jackson 's partner Andre Nicholas, also 28, lying in swathes of green plastic. She called the police and Mr Nicholas was confirmed dead from 'multiple stabbings'.

Now, Jackson has been arrested on charges of first and second-degree murder and first and second-degree assault, as well as dangerous weapon charges.

According to court documents, Jackson's mother left him and Mr Nicholas, both of whom lived with their parents, in the basement in the 2500 block of Garret Avenue while she went to work.

However, when she returned at around 9pm that evening, her son allegedly came upstairs and told her to gather all of her 'important papers' together because they had to leave.

When she asked why, Jackson replied that there was a dead body in his bed, police wrote in court papers obtained by The Baltimore Sun.

He then reportedly went on to say he had choked and stabbed Mr Nicholas 'because the victim wanted him to do something he didn't want to do,' although it was not clear what this was.

Jackson's mother then ventured into his bedroom and discovered 'what she believed to be a body wrapped in plastic on the defendants bed', police said. It was later confirmed to be Mr Nicholas.

Mark McLaurin, a friend of Mr Nicholas, said the victim and Jackson had been in a relationship for more than a year, and had appeared happy together.

He told the newspaper: 'They had their ups and downs, but I really am shocked by this," McLaurin said. "In my estimation, they really did love each other.'

He added that Mr Nicholas was well-known in the area's gay community, worked at Club Bunns on Lexington Street and volunteered with various political campaigns.

'He was an incredible presence in the community,' he said. 'I honestly don't know people who were better known than him and so universally well-liked.'

At around 4pm today, two days after the alleged murder, an image showing a large object wrapped in plastic on a basement floor was posted to the Facebook page of Jackson while he was in jail.

Baltimore police are investigating how and by whom the picture - which could be an image of Mr Nicholas's body in Jackson's bedroom - was uploaded. 

Detective Jeremy Silbert told the newspaper that police 'are certain that the suspect does not have access to his cellular phone in jail.' The disturbing photo was later removed. 

Jackson, who has previously been arrested on charges of theft, burglary and violating protective orders, remains at Central Booking without bond. He has no listed attorney.
