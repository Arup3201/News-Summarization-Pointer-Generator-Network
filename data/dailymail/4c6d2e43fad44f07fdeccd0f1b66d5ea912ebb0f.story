Louis van Gaal has faced considerable criticism from supporters in recent weeks, but Manchester United's form suggests the Dutchman deserves credit for his tactics.

Some turgid attacking displays have frustrated the club's fans, but over the last 15 Premier League matches United have secured more points than any other team.

Van Gaal's side have taken 34 points from a possible 45. Chelsea, meanwhile, have taken 33, Manchester City 31, Tottenham 29, Arsenal and Liverpool both took 28, and Southampton won 24.

Louis van Gaal has faced criticism from fans, but no team has won more points from the last 15 league games

Jose Mourinho and Chelsea are second on the list, having taken 33 points from the last 15 games 

Manchester United - 34 points

Chelsea - 33 points 

Manchester City - 31 points

Tottenham - 29 points

Liverpool and Arsenal - 28

Southampton - 24 points 

During that period, United lost just one match (against Southampton) and managed to beat three of their rivals for a top-four spot (Southampton, Arsenal and Liverpool).

They also won six successive games in November and December, a run only bettered by local rivals City, who won seven over the same period.

Premier League leaders Chelsea endured a tumultuous end to 2014, losing to both Newcastle and Tottenham between mid-December and New Year's Day, but rallied thereafter, dropping just two points from their last five matches.
