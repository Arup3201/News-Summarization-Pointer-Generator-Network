Brown Labrador-spaniel cross Arthur became 'spaced out' and then depressed after accidentally eating a lump of cannabis

A mischievous dog became 'spaced out' and depressed after accidentally eating a lump of cannabis while on a walk.

Brown Labrador-spaniel cross Arthur 
bounded off across the field and started eating something, believed to be a cake laced with the drug, in the field 
while on walk with owner Emma Butterfield.

Ms Butterfield, 40, thought nothing of it until her dog started to shake, look dazed and struggled to stand up.

Her partner Joe Lepper, 41, rushed the six-year-old dog to the vets where he was described as being 'intoxicated'.

He stopped shaking at the vets, but started to look more 'spaced-out', slowly leaning over and began to drift off.

Mr Lepper, from Street, Somerset, said: 
'Arthur had darted off because he saw something on the ground, which 
isn’t unusual, and ate it.

'But about an hour or two later, when Emma brought him home he started looking very dazed, confused and couldn’t walk.

'He was really wobbly and when we put his food out for him he wouldn’t touch it, which is unusual.

'At that stage we didn’t think that he 
was stoned, but on reflection, he was giving all the hallmarks of being a
very stoned dog.

'The vet was fairly convinced that he had taken some kind of drug and that he was stoned.'

Arthur was taken to Orchard Veterinary Group, in Glastonbury, Somerset, where he was seen by vet Niall Taylor.

Mr Taylor said: 'When I saw him first he
walked into the consulting room fine, but he was indeed shaking like a 
leaf, it’s no wonder they were worried.

Arthur started to shake, looked dazed and struggled to stand up after eating the drug

'I checked him over and he looked a bit 
flushed, with red gums. The most striking thing about the examination 
was his incredible low temperature - several degrees below normal, 
something only usually seen in severe shock.

'But strangely he seemed fine, with no 
sign of shock. I even checked by using a second thermometer. His heart 
rate was also extremely slow.

'It was beginning to dawn on me that 
this was a possible intoxication. The trouble is that we had no idea of 
how much he’d had or of exactly what, although I strongly suspected 
marijuana, given the circumstances.

'Probably in some sort of sweet cake, hence the reason he was so keen to eat it.'

Mr Lepper was given strict instructions 
to keep a close eye on Arthur overnight but despite his condition 
getting better his mood worsened and he spiralled into depression.

Mr Lepper said: 'Arthur is usually a very happy dog, full of energy and friendly. But after he’d eaten what ever it was that he ate he was very depressed that night.

Joe Lepper rushed the dog to the vets after he started to look dazed. The dog has now been given a clean bill of health

'I think he was really confused and sad 
about why he was feeling that way, why he couldn’t walk properly or why 
presumably he was feeling so giddy.

'He was sad all night and even a little 
in the morning but eventually as it worked its way out of his system he 
was back to his normal, happy self.'

A check-up at the vets the next day gave
the dog a clean bill of health, but the dog's owners are now urging 
others to keep an eye while walking their pets.

Marijuana is toxic to dogs and cats, and symptoms can be severe and life-threatening if not treated promptly.
