Deepening scandal: Paul Flowers was handed a £60,000 'golden goodbye' after he resigned, despite leading the bank to the brink of collapse

The scandal surrounding former Co-op Bank chief Paul Flowers deepened last night after it was revealed he quit a drugs charity over allegations of up to £150,000 in false expenses claims.

The Methodist minister – under police investigation for buying crystal meth and crack cocaine – was suspended by the Lifeline Project after allegedly lodging ‘significant’ false claims between 1992 and 2004.

The Manchester-based charity conducted a full investigation, but former Co-op chairman Flowers, who was its chairman of trustees, resigned before its conclusion.

Last night, charity chief executive Ian Wardle confirmed the Charity Commission was informed of the findings but it is not thought any action was taken.

Mr Wardle described the money as a ‘significant sum’ which required a ‘lengthy and thorough investigation’.

The revelations will only reinforce concerns that City regulators, the Co-op board and Labour failed to adequately investigate the past of the drug-taking minister who was once invited to Ed Miliband’s office for private talks.

As Labour insisted the affair was a ‘desperate political distraction’, it was revealed:

Flowers was last night still in hiding – three days after it was revealed he paid £300 for Class A drugs during a deal captured on film.

He lodged the expense claims during his voluntary tenure at the Lifeline Project – a charity providing services for those with drug and alcohol addictions.

A charity insider said Flowers claimed an astonishing £150,000 between 1992 and 2004.

Mr Wardle would not confirm the exact figure but said that Flowers had been suspended immediately when concerns were raised.

He said: ‘Trustees at Lifeline are disappointed to hear the news regarding Rev Paul Flowers this week.

Ed Miliband hosted dinners for disgraced bank chief Paul Flowers at one of London’s plushest restaurants, it emerged yesterday.

Labour sources confirmed that Flowers, then chairman of the Co-op Bank, attended two dinners at the Cinnamon Club as a member of the Labour leader’s elite Business and Industry Advisory Board.

The shamed Methodist minister was recruited by Mr Miliband in 2011 to advise him on banking reform, although it has since emerged he had no banking qualifications.

The dinners, in July and November of 2011, were both attended by about 20 Labour-friendly business people, allowing them extraordinary access to the Labour leader.

They are likely to have cost thousands of pounds.

The Cinnamon Club in Westminster specialises in modern Indian cuisine and is one of the most expensive restaurants of its kind.

A typical meal there could easily cost upwards of £80 per head.

Specials on last night’s menu included ‘spice crusted fillet steak of Wagyu beef with stir-fried baby morels and saffron sauce’, priced at £95.

The wine list includes a number of vintage bottles, such as a Chateau Latour 1959, which costs £3,130.

'Paul Flowers and Lifeline parted company in 2004. When concerns were identified regarding Rev Flowers’s expenses, I took immediate steps with the assistance of Lifeline’s solicitor to suspend Rev Flowers.’

Mr Wardle added: ‘The Charity Commission was also fully informed of the findings of the investigation and the outcome. Rev Flowers resigned from his (voluntary and unpaid) position as chairman of trustees before our own internal proceedings could be concluded.’

The charity’s income is generated via public sector grants and local contracts and a variety of small local and specialist scheme funds.

In another development, it emerged that Flowers was made chairman of governors of a Yorkshire primary school after pornography was found on his council laptop.

He was given the prestigious role at Lidget Green School, Bradford, after he had resigned over the laptop incident in 2011.

The school said last night it had not been told by the council about the incident and had ‘no reason to believe’ he had resigned for reasons other than those he had officially stated.

This was that he had ‘increasing and competing demands’ on his time.

Flowers, who has been ‘suspended indefinitely’ from the Methodist Church, led the Co-op Bank for three years.

Earlier this week it was revealed that he used his Co-op email account to hire a rent boy for sex.

Ciaron Dodd said they met for depraved sessions in plush hotels – in rooms paid for by the struggling Co-op.

It has also emerged that Flowers was convicted of gross indecency in a public toilet with a man in 1981, but he was forgiven by the Methodist Church.

He admitted the offence at Fareham Magistrates’ Court in Hampshire, and was fined £75 with £35 legal costs.

Bradford Council was under fire last night after apparently failing to inform Labour Party headquarters of the gay porn found on Paul Flowers’ work laptop.

The former banking boss was allowed to continue with his high-profile role with the party even after resigning from the council in disgrace.

Flowers, 63, was confronted by council officials in 2011 after IT workers found the images while mending his computer.

He resigned immediately – but the official reason given was that he was leaving for family reasons and because of his high-pressured job at Co-op Bank.

Last night, it emerged that senior executives at the council were aware of the incident, as was the then Labour leader of the council.

But no one thought it was appropriate to make public the real reasons behind his departure.

Flowers was even appointed as chairman of the governors at Lidget Green Primary School, in Bradford, after he had resigned as councillor.

Last night, there was anger among councillors who said the public had a right to know what Flowers had done.

Councillor Paul Cromie said: ‘This looks like a cover-up. When Flowers resigned, there was a press release issued which said his workload was too heavy.

‘If the council leader knew the real reason at the time, then he should have told Labour HQ. It would have been his duty.

'I also think the electorate had a right to know – after all, they are the ones that elected him.’

The leader of the council when Flowers resigned was Ian Greenwood, who lost his seat to a Respect Party candidate in May 2012.

Before Flowers left, he said: ‘Paul is a tremendously gifted and committed individual who has made a significant and lasting contribution to the community in Great Horton, to the council and to the Labour group.

‘I will be sad to see him go but I fully understand the reasoning behind Paul’s decision.’

But despite his public praise, it now appears he knew about the porn – and chose not to make it widely known.

Councillor David Green, current leader of Bradford Council, said he did not know whether his predecessor had taken action.

He said: ‘I don’t know what happened at the time and I don’t know who was given information. If the Labour Party are saying that they weren’t informed then I have no reason to disbelieve them.’

A council spokesman said it was not considered necessary to alert Labour headquarters or the public because Flowers had not broken the law – just council rules.

The spokesman said: ‘It must be emphasised that this material was not illegal. In the light of the resignation no further investigations into how the material came to be on the computer were required.

‘It was a potential breach of the council’s internal policy.’

A Labour spokesman yesterday insisted Ed Miliband and other senior figures were not told why Flowers had been forced to resign from Bradford council, but did not deny that some MPs and shadow ministers may have known.

The spokesman said: ‘The leader of the Labour Party did not know, the shadow cabinet did not know. No one who could reasonably be described as being in a position of leadership knew about this.’

Mr Greenwood was not able to be contacted yesterday.
