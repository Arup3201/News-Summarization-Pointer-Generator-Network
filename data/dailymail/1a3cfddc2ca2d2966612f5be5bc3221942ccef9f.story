Andy Murray crashed out of the Mutua Madrid Open at the third-round stage on Thursday as he suffered a straight-sets defeat to Colombia's Santiago Giraldo.

Murray produced a disappointing display which saw his opponent, ranked 38 places below him at 46th in the world, rarely troubled en route to a 6-3, 6-2 victory and a quarter-final meeting with Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut.

The Wimbledon champion's below-par showing comes as a considerable surprise the day after he had made a decent start to his clay-court season by seeing off Nicolas Almagro, another local favourite, in round two.

In that contest, Murray, playing his first match in a month, had battled to a 6-1, 1-6, 6-4 triumph over a player known to be particularly dangerous on clay.

But there was little fight exhibited by the Scot on Thursday in an encounter Giraldo took control of from the off.

In an effort to explain an erratic performance in which he showed little fight, Murray spoke of his split from coach Ivan Lendl and his ‘inconsistent’ play.

‘My coach is missing. That’s a big part of my team,’ said Murray. ‘I didn’t envisage a finish like that. I need to sit down and think about that the next couple of days and see what I need to do.’

Having served to take a 1-0 lead, Giraldo swiftly extended his lead by breaking Murray at the first opportunity and then holding in the third game.

Murray got a game on the board for 3-1 but struggled to exert any real pressure on Giraldo as the rest of the set played out.

It did not take long for Giraldo to then break Murray again in the second, doing so in the third game to make it 2-1.

And he repeated the trick another time to move 5-2 ahead before serving out the match to continue his impressive run of form on clay this year, having reached the final in Barcelona last month.

Murray will be hoping for an improvement in next week's ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event in Rome, which will be his last event before the French Open begins on May 25.
