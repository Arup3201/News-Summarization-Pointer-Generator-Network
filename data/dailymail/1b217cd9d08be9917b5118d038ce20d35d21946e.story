A mother-of-two has a sleep condition which means she has fallen asleep next to loud speakers, on the back of a moped and even on the bus holding her newborn baby.

Claire Metters, 38, from Conwy, North Wales, says she suffers with narcolepsy and faces a daily battle to stay awake for her children.

She claims she must nap for four hours a day, on top of getting nine hours sleep at night, in order to function.

Claire Metters, 38, has the sleep condition narcolepsy which means she faces a daily battle to stay awake for her children - Lucie, seven (right), and Aimee, 12 (left)

Ms Metters said: ‘If I didn’t take my naps when the girls are at school I would fall asleep cooking them dinner, or tidying up.’

Ms Metters is no longer able to drive or work, as her body is too worn out and constantly needs to rest.

Her day starts at 7am when she wakes up and helps her daughters Lucie, seven, and Aimee, 12, get ready for school.

Claire then walks her younger daughter to the nearby school for 9am and by 9.30am she is back in bed, taking the first of her scheduled naps.

She wakes herself up again at 11am and will go about her day, doing the housework, preparing food and supporting the charity Narcolepsy UK charity.

By 1pm Ms Metters is ready to head back to bed for her next two-hour nap, and she sleeps until 3pm when she picks up Lucie from school.

Ms Metters, who had to give up work because of her illness, has to nap for two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon to ensure she is awake for her children before and after school

For years doctors told Ms Metters that her symptoms were caused by stress before she was eventually diagnosed with narcolepsy after Aimee's birth

Ms Metters says she suffers with narcolepsy, a neurological condition which means although she sleeps a lot, she doesn’t get the restful sleep she needs during the night and as a result suffers constant nightmares, hallucinations and sleep paralysis.

She said: ‘I have a very different sleep pattern to other people and can wake up to 15 times a night, so I don’t get the restorative sleep I need.

‘I get terrible nightmares and hallucinations which are triggered by things I have seen in the news or online - I slip straight back into dream sleep while drifting off which means I am unable to stop myself going back into the nightmare.

7am - Wake up, have breakfast, get the children ready for school

9am - Walk Lucie to school

9.30am - Go back to bed for the first nap

11.30am - Wake up from nap, continue with day including doing housework

1pm - Go back to bed for afternoon nap

3pm - Wake up from nap

3.30pm - Pick up Lucie from school

3.30pm - 10pm - Prepare dinner for the children, enjoy the evening together

10pm - Go to bed

‘I also have hallucinations where I hear intruders coming into my home.

‘It’s exhausting and incredibly emotionally draining.’

She added: ‘I want to be the best parent I can be for my children so I have found that taking strategic naps during the day is the only way I can keep my sleeping under control.’

Ms Metters first started to notice her symptoms of hallucinations, nightmares and extreme tiredness when she was 13 years old, but her symptoms were mild and didn’t become a serious problem until she was 26.

She found herself falling asleep in public and in places which could have been dangerous - like on the back a moped while on a summer holiday in Greece.

She said: ‘I was that tired on the holiday that I closed my eyes sitting on the back of the bike and actually nodded off straight to sleep.’

Ms Metters got to the stage where she was unable to control her sleeping during the day had to take naps in laybys while driving to work.

She said: ‘In the past I found that despite loud music, bumpy roads and being in public my tiredness could not be stopped and before I managed my condition I could sleep anywhere.’

Before she learned to control her condition, Ms Metters fell asleep on a moped and also on the bus while holding Aimee as a new-born baby

Ms Metters suffers nightmares and hallucinations at night meaning she does not sleep well. This causes her to be exhausted during the day and leaves her at risk of falling asleep in inappropriate places

The breaking point came for Ms Metters when she became a mother.

She
 said: ‘A few weeks after I had given birth to my eldest daughter I was 
sat on the bus and I found myself repeatedly nodding off, while trying 
to hold my new-born baby.

‘This was when I realised I could no longer hide from my tiredness and my doctors needed to take my complaints seriously.’

Narcolepsy, which occurs in one in every 2,000 people, is a sleep disorder that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times.

It is a long-term neurological condition that disrupts normal sleeping patterns.

Symptoms include, sleep attacks, daytime sleepiness, nightmares, hallucinations and cataplexy - temporary muscle weakness in response to emotion.

It is often caused by an autoimmune response - this is when antibodies are released by the body but instead of destroying disease, they attack healthy cells.

In the case of narcolepsy, antibodies attack the areas of the brain that produce a sleep-regulating chemical.

There is currently no cure but the condition can sometimes be managed, for example, by taking regular naps, eating healthily and exercising.

In some cases, medications such as antidepressants or stimulants can also help.

For 12 years she was constantly told 
by doctors that it was just stress was making her tired but when she was
 finally diagnosed she was relieved.

She
 also suffers from cataplexy which means she loses control of her neck 
and leg muscles at moments of extreme emotion, such as if she is in pain
 or laughing hard.

She manages to control this with medication, but unfortunately hasn’t managed to find an effective medication for her narcolepsy - which is why she must stick religiously to her napping routine.

Before she was diagnosed, Ms Metters would resort to extreme measures to try and keep herself awake, including taking layers off to stay cold, sitting on the most uncomfortable seat available and even physically hurting herself.

She said: ‘I would make excuses to go to the toilet and then slap my face, and splash myself with water to try and wake up.

‘I would pinch my skin really hard to try and try to use the pain to keep me awake.’

When she finally gained the courage to explain the severity of her narcolepsy to her friends, family and children’s school she was pleased with the support she received.

However, she says there were a few people who assumed her condition made her a less attentive mother - something she fiercely rejects.

She has now worked out a routine which works for her family.

She will save what she calls ‘screen time’ for time when she needs to rest, letting her children watch television, play on the laptop, or watch a DVD while she sleeps.

Ms Metters worries that some people think her condition makes her a less attentive mother but says she is still dedicated to her children and that she does not allow her illness to get her down

She said: ‘I do have guilt about finding
 time to rest when my children are in my care. I never wanted my 
children to have to occupy themselves.

‘But I also have to look after me- I have to rest and not step outside my limitations so I can be a good mother.’

She joked: ‘The children have become wise to it now. They tell me I look tired and ask if I want a nap just so they can have a go on the computer!’

She added: ‘Although I am more tired than other people, I haven’t let it get me down and I am still dedicated to my children and determined to enjoy life.’
