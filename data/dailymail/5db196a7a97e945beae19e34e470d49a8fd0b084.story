It is surely the bane of drivers' lives - discovering what you think is the perfect parking spot, only for it to be ruined by the appearance of a set of double yellow lines.

But at just four foot wide, and far too narrow to fit a car down, it was unlikely any motorists were going to risk a ticket down this lane.

This 'ridiculous' set of double yellow lines, painted by bungling council workers on a Wiltshire lane,  have now been covered over after complaints from residents.

Swindon Borough Council became was branded a laughing stock when the lines appeared earlier this year.

A 'ridiculous' set of double yellow lines were painted by council workers on a Swindon lane which is too narrow to drive down

The council blamed the gaffe on contractors, incredibly saying the workers had forgotten 'just how big cars actually are'.

There was just 13 inches of space between the two sets of yellow lines - which is roughly the width of some high-end car tyres, and barely wide enough to fit a toy car between.

The council blamed the gaffe on contractors, incredibly saying the workers had forgotten 'just how big cars actually are'.

A spokesman for the council has now confirmed the yellow lines have now been covered over in black paint.

They said: 'The lines will be burnt off, but in the meantime they have been painted over as a temporary measure.'

The yellow lines were in a lane so narrow a man struggles to walk in the space in between them (left)  and (right) resident Liz Adams in the lane, now the council has 'erased them' using black paint

Ray Mudhar, the owner of Ray's Autos near the alleyway double yellow lines in Swindon, previously described the gaffe as 'one of the stupidest things I've ever seen.'

He said: 'When me and my mate saw it we were just laughing our heads off. It's a waste of time, waste of money and waste of material.

'The only thing you could get down there would be a bike and no-one is going to leave a bike parked up there.

'They have painted down all the alleys around here. I can see why, because emergency vehicles need to get through and there is no room if there are parked cars.

'This is ridiculous though.'
