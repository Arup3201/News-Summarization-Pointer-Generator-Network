His skills on the pitch and his gift for self-publicity made David Beckham a sporting giant.

A 50ft billboard of the former footballer towers over drivers and pedestrians outside Macyâ€™s department store.

The huge poster shows Beckham posing in a pair of tight blue and white striped briefs.

An industrial setting provides the backdrop for the shoot as he clutches a metal pipe, showing off his extensive tattoos.

The 38-year-old has been strutting his stuff to promote his new Bodywear Collection for high street retailer H&M.

But this is not the first time the father of four has stopped traffic in New York.

A giant 220ft hand-painted mural of the star appeared on a skyscraper in Manhattan in 2012.

He is also set to star in an action-packed TV advert, performing his own stunts.
