In her application to take part in Miss England, Danielle Tyler wrote of how her greatest achievement in life is her three-year-old daughter.

She was ecstatic to be accepted into the beauty pageant – only to have her dreams dashed weeks later when she was told she could not participate after all. 

The reason? Because she is a mother.

Furious: Danielle Tyler, pictured here with her daughter Annelise, was kicked out of the Miss England because they are against mothers competing

Model: 'I was really upset when I found out and very annoyed about it,' says Danielle, pictured here

The 23-year-old said the organisers of the 86-year-old competition informed her it is against their policy to accept entrants who have children.

Miss Tyler, who is a full-time mother to Annelise and has taken part in some modelling projects, said: ‘I had started to get really excited about the competition. I was really upset when I found out, it’s a disgrace. 

'I am a proud young mum and I even said in my application that my biggest achievement was having my daughter.

‘It was only when a friend mentioned their “no children” policy I decided to question it and that is when I was notified by email that I could no longer take part – despite having been accepted two weeks before. It is an outdated rule.’

Disappointed: Danielle, left and right with daughter Annelise, had her initial application for Miss England  accepted and spent two weeks rallying support from friends and family to qualify for the next stage

Sweet: Danielle, mother to Annelise, pictured here, claims she was told that despite being accepted she could no longer continue in the competition, due to Miss England's policy of entrants not being allowed to be mothers

Determined: Danielle hasn't let her experience discourage her ambition and she has now qualified for the Miss Midlands final of Miss Great Britain, which does allow mothers to enter

Director of Miss England Angie Beasley said: ‘Miss World and Miss England are both run by mothers who value highly normal family values. It is unfair on the child and her family to take the mother away for the year while she travels the globe.

‘It raises issues about who would take care of the child. Surely it seems obvious to anyone that for a mother to devote herself fully to a role such as Miss England it would be unfair on any child.’

Miss Tyler, from Belper, Derbyshire, has not let the experience discourage her and has qualified for the Miss Midlands final of Miss Great Britain, which does allow mums. 

She added: ‘I am delighted Miss Great Britain has a positive attitude towards mothers.’
