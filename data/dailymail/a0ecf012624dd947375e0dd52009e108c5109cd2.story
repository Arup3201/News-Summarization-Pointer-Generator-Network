You want to hate him, you really do. There’s the biting, the diving and the casual racism.

And even last night there was that ridiculous sense of nurturing a grievances against England, as though he were a perpetual victim.

‘Before the game too many people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years,’ said Luis Suarez. ‘This is a very good time for me. I want to see what they think now.’VIDEO Scroll down to see Suarez thank wife and kids in emotional dressing room video

Of course, it was ridiculous given that he was just been voted Footballer of the Year by both English players and journalists. It seems that Suarez wants nothing but unconditional praise, however he behaves.

Yet despite all of those reasons to dislike him, it’s impossible not to admire Suarez. Like Diego Maradona, there may be legitimate reasons not to want him to become a role model for your children.

But as a footballer, he is throwback to the how you wished you could play the game as a child.

Maradona was never quite just a one-man team in 1986. There were very good players around him in the likes of Jorge Valdano and Jorge Burruchuga. Nevertheless, it is true that without Maradona it is impossible that Argentina would have won the World Cup.

Likewise, last night it wasn’t all about Suarez. Edinson Cavani had an excellent game, the perfection of his cross for Suarez’s first goal will live long in the memory; Egidio Arevalo held the midfield together, snuffing out threats when they emerged; and Nicolas Lodeiro, until he went off, was a pest, irritating Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka with his incessant pressing.

And yet at times it felt like one man taking on England on his own. No-one will dispute that Suarez was the difference between the teams.

And his passion, his determination to play despite his injury and the sheer joy of scoring against England represent something important about international football.

That feeling is hard to replicate when playing for a club. It is the burden of symbolically leading a nation in a game of football that brings that degree of intensity and emotional release.

His extraordinary wide-eyed and ecstatic look when he scored is the reason why football was invented. It distilled the joy and aggression that the sport is able to produce in a single moment of skill.

It is likely that the misjudged grievances he holds against the English fuelled his performance. It certainly did Maradona in 1986. In a wildly inappropriate language, he described the 1986 World Cup win over England as revenge for the Argentine defeat in the 1982 Falklands War.

‘It was as if we had beaten a country, not just a football team,’ wrote Maradona in his autobiography about that game.

‘Although we had said before the game that football had nothing to do with the Malvinas (Falklands) war, we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds. And this was revenge.’

Suarez’s misguided sense of injustice is not as outlandish as that but it is still very silly. But however foolish his motives, the performance remains phenomenal. And once the disappointment of losing has passed, that is what we will remember from this game.

The striker’s display represented the best of international football last night. He led his national team in every sense, through his attitude to the game, with his constant cajoling of his team and by scoring his goals.

And when a truly great player does that and when it clearly means so much to him, it is difficult not to be impressed and moved, for that is football at its purest.

What Luis Suarez did last night will live with us for many years. And just like Maradona’s goal in 1986 - the second one, that is - one day we will be able to celebrate that.
