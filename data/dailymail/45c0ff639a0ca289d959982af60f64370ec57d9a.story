Detained: British TV reporter Mark Stone reports live as he is detained by police van in Beijing today for filming in Tienanmen Square

A British TV reporter was seized in China today as he tried to film in Tienanmen Square and managed to broadcast live from the back of the police van.

The detention of Sky News journalist Mark Stone in the capital Beijing came as the country's new communist leader takes charge.

The Asia correspondent and cameraman, Andy Portch, had been reporting on the leadership change from Tiananmen Square but were confronted by police.

Officers took the journalists to a nearby police station, although a Sky News spokesman has said they have since been released and returned to company's office in Beijing.

Mr Stone reported live from the back of the police van and as they arrived at the station, and explained how officers had approached the news team and asked them to stop filming.

He said the authorities had intervened after they heard him refer to the student-led protests in the square in 1989.

Speaking as he was removed from the van, Mr Stone said: 'This is just a little insight really into the way reporting works in China.

'Most of the time things are fine and for most of the day no problems at all, but then every now and then this happens.'

Mr Stone, who was also being filmed by 
the police, described it as a 'surreal experience', and added: 'It may 
look like a set up, I assure you it isn't.'

Censorship: Officers confront the Sky News team in Tienanmen Square and lead them to a police van

Live on air: Mr Stone and his cameraman was able to broadcast live from the back of the van

Held: The journalists were then led into a room, while being filmed by the Chinese authorities

Shutdown: A police officer eventually asked for the Sky News camera to be switched off

He said the police were unaware that he was live on air and that they believed he was recording footage for later on.

Mr Stone added it was 'remarkable' he was allowed to film, and said: 'I should make the point, throughout this the police have been entirely civil with us but none the less they are detaining us.'

The reporter and cameraman were led into a room filled with desks and chairs, and Mr Stone said he thought they were in the Forbidden City, just north of the square.

As Mr Stone tried to leave the room, an officer stopped him and said they did not have permission to film inside the 'park'.

He told the news team to wait 
'patiently' because officials were coming to speak to them. The officer 
also offered to translate for them but asked them to turn the camera 
off.

Authority: The police said Sky news did not have permission to film but the broadcaster insists it did

'Civil': Mr Stone said the police had been 'entirely civil' to him throughout the incident

A Sky News spokesman said: 'Mark and Andy were told the reason for their brief detention was that they were not displaying their special press accreditation passes allowing them to film on TiananmenÂ  Square in a 'visible manner'.'

But the broadcaster has insisted it did have permission to film in the historic square.

It follows Xi Jinping official 
appointment as president, which seals his position as the most powerful 
man in the world's largest country.

The new leader, who has taken over 
from Hu Jintao, will be charged with promoting the 'Chinese Dream' which
will propel hundreds of millions of China's citizens into the middle 
class over the coming decades.

The
ruling Communist Party hopes that China's growing economic will help it
become more powerful than the West, overtaking the U.S. and Europe.

Mr
Stone is based in Beijing, having taken up his current role last year, 
but began his career as a producer with ABC News in 2002.

He
moved to Sky News in 2005, becoming a reporter two years later, and 
worked around the world, including Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.

Mr Stone was also praised for the way he bravely confronted rioters in Clapham, south London, two years ago, despite numerous attacks on journalists covering the unrest.

The reporter asked looters what they were doing, if they were having fun and if they were proud of themselves.
