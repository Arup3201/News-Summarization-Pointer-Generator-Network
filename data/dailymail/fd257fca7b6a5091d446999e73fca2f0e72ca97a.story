Middle-class  cheat: Caroline Foxley, 59, claimed over £20,000 in benefits despite having £200,000 in a Swiss bank and says she can not touch the money because the Mafia would come after her

A middle-class benefits cheat who claimed over £20,000 in benefits despite having £200,000 in a Swiss bank has said she can not touch the money because the Mafia would come after her.

Caroline Foxley, 59, was convicted last month of claiming job seekers allowance, housing benefits and income support while her two children went to private schools.

But despite having £200,000 deposited in Switzerland, Foxley claimed today that her dead ex-boyfriend had been mixed up with Italian criminals who controlled this money and she did not see it as her own. 

The mother of two’s assertion that the Mafia would try to kill her if she tried to get the money back came as she was due to be sentenced today. 

However, a judge was asked to adjourn the case and told Foxley had failed to help probation workers compile a pre-sentence report because of her ‘chaotic’ lifestyle.

David Leathley, defending, described Foxley as ‘infuriating’ and told the court: 'She is an enigma, but more of an enigma is Dr Kurt Meyer, the late doctor who got himself arrested in Italy.

'She believes Dr Kurt Mayer was, inter alia, in trouble with the Mafia and/or the Mob and they have control of the money and she was too frightened to present that scenario at her trial.

'She tells me that if she tries to recover the money she is dead. She is adamant that she cannot touch the money because it is not hers.

'She tells me that the only money she can readily access here and now is £40 loaned to her by a friend.

'Had the proper authorities been able to see what the position was with that account in Zurich they might have come to the conclusion it was not her money at all to spend as she wished.'

Mr Leathley said Foxley relied upon the goodwill and charity of friends to survive as she was effectively homeless.

'This infuriating woman is foxing everyone’s plan to better manage the case, manage the allegations, now convictions, not because she is brazenly cheeky, but because she is in a state of chaos,' he added.

'I have to say that in my humble opinion Caroline Foxley has a personality disorder.

'If I was ever able to publish my diaries this chapter would be entitled "The strange case of Caroline Foxley".'

Foxley was convicted following a trial at Gloucester Crown Court of four charges of dishonestly failing to report a change in her circumstances affecting her entitlement to benefits and dishonestly making false representations to obtain benefits between March 2007 and March 2009.

The three-day trial outlined how Foxley had received £306,000 from the sale of her Cotswold home in 2007, and put around two-thirds of it in an offshore account.

She then dipped into the pot to pay school fees for her now adult children, Freddie and Miranda, who attended institutions including Cheltenham Ladies’ College, Malvern College and Bloxham School in Oxfordshire.

Convicted: A jury took less than an hour to convict Foxley, who claimed the money from Cotswold District Council and the Department of Work and Pensions

She went on to claim income support and Jobseeker's Allowance from the Department of Work and Pensions, as well as council tax and housing benefits from Cotswold District Council.

Such allowances are available only to people with less than £16,000 in capital assets but she did not declare the house proceeds and said she only had £100 in a Lloyds TSB account.

Foxley claimed although her name was on the property and the bank accounts she didn’t declare it to the authorities because she did not regard the proceeds as her own and felt it was in trust for her her children's father Dr Meyer, and the two offspring.

She said the Dr Meyer, who died last year, stopped supporting her and the children in 2007 and left her riddled with debt - including unpaid school fees.

Foxley, who was described during the trial as someone who was 'using the benefits system as their own pocket money to help finance an already wealthy lifestyle', said she never touched the money from the house sale as she did not know where it came from and only spent it on his instructions.

A jury took less than an hour to convict the benefits cheat, who claimed the money from Cotswold District Council and the Department of Work and Pensions.

Today the court heard that Foxley had lined up a £30,000 housekeeping job but that had fallen through because of her trial.

'At the senior age of 59 she is having to graft out a living,' Mr Leathley said.

'She is not living on champagne and caviar, she is a cleaner.'

Alexander West, prosecuting, opposed the application to adjourn the sentencing hearing.

He said: 'At trial this defendant was found to be dishonest. Explanations put forward today of Mafia involvement or the like should be viewed with that in mind.

'The myriad of excuses and delays of these trial proceedings have brought about significant costs, not only to the prosecution but the public purse.'

Assistant Judge Advocate General Alistair McGrigor said the sentencing would be assisted by a probation report and he was reluctantly adjourning the case.

'Your counsel has put forward why I should not sentence you today and I have to say that I am persuaded but very reluctantly,' he said.

'If I felt you were pulling the wool over my eyes you would most certainly be going to prison today.'

Foxley, of Shuthonger, Tewkesbury, will be sentenced on a date to be fixed. She was released on conditional bail.
