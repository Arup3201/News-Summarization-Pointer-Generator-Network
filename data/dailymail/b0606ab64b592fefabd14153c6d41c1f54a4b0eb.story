'The Matrix was my idea': Richard Bey said that the idea for the multi-billion dollar movie came from his undergraduate dissertation

A writer who claims the idea for the multi-billion dollar Matrix film trilogy was stolen from his university dissertation today took the makers of the film franchise to the High Court.

Richard Bey said the inspiration for the movies came from his 10,000 word undergraduate dissertation he wrote between 1994 and 1996, whilst completing a social anthropology degree.

The screenwriter or writers behind the 
films have never been publicly identified and Mr Bey, 49, who lives in 
London, says that the core ideas came from him.

Tom Moody Stewart, for Warner Bros Entertainment UK Ltd, told the court: 'In the films, humans are treated as batteries - they are set within the bodies of a vastly powerful machine and the body is used to power the mechanism.

'The Wachowski brothers had full creative control over the films, but there is some mystique over who wrote the screenplay,' he said.

'There was certainly a screenplay. However, whether for publicity purposes or to fuel mystique, Warner have never identified everybody involved in the creative process.

'That may be something that has given rise to some of Mr Bey's assertions in this claim.'

Mr Stewart went on to deny that there was any connection between the film and Mr Bey's work, written while he was an undergraduate at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London.

He argued that ideas in a book that Mr Bey has written could not be taken into account, as it post-dated production of the films, which began in 1995.

Mr Bey said that 'ideas about the nature of dreams and the mechanistic nature of the unconscious' in his dissertation about semiotics and race had been passed on by somebody at his university to Warner Bros.

He claimed there was an 'intimate relationship' between SOAS and Warner Bros, as both have links to the Rockerfeller Institute.

He told Mr Justice Vos that he had not yet put a value on his claim, but commented on the 'exceptional cultural value' of the trilogy and said that each film had grossed $1.3billion (Â£850million).

The judge said of the popular sci-fi films: 'The Matrix films were shown in cinemas up and down the country and overseas. The films were highly successful.

'I think I once saw one on an aeroplane. I think it was the second one. I hope Warner Bros won't mind if I say I used the fast forward button a lot. I'm not sure I entirely followed it.'

However he dashed the writer's hopes of a payout and allowed Warner Bros' application to strike out Mr Bey's claim.

The judge said: 'The dissertation concerns semiotics and race - there is nothing in it that I have been able to identity that tells a story like the story concerned in the Matrix films.'
