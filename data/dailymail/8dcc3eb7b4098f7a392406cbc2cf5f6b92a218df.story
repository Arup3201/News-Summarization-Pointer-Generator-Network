A Russian prankster risked a grisly death scrambling to the top of a pole above a bridge in St. Petersburg as it opened over the river before somehow managing to give security guards the slip.

The man was first pictured standing on a low section of the city's Palace Bridge close to the water level after apparently climbing onto it from a boat while it was in its closed position.

But as a ship approached along the River Neva, the bridge was raised up to allow it to pass, hoisting the man high into the sky.

As the bridge is being raised open, the man then begins to scramble along the pole where he is spotted by crowds and someone shouts: 'See, the top man!'

After making it to the top he hangs upside down by his legs and lights the red flare which he holds up for around ten seconds.

Security guards were said to be 'outraged' after the man then simply disappeared into the night. It is not clear whether he escaped by jumping into the river.
