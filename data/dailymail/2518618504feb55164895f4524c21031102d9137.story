Ryanair has backtracked on plans to develop a cheap flights to America- just days after it said it had received approval from the board.

On Monday, the budget airline had announced plans to run transatlantic services between key European cities and the US with one-way tickets costing from as little as £10.

But today, bosses have been forced to admit the carrier is not about to move into long-haul flights.

Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, had announced just days ago that is was planning to develop a transatlantic service for budget passengers, with one-way tickets between the US and key European cities costing as little as $15

In a brief statement, the Irish airline's board said it had not approved any such plans, nor would it.

'In the light of recent press coverage, the Board of Ryanair Holdings plc wishes to clarify that it has not considered or approved any transatlantic project and does not intend to do so.'

The sudden U-turn came after Ryanair unveiled its plan to operate budget flights to the US within five years.

The idea was part of an aggressive growth strategy, connecting airports such as London Stansted and Berlin with New York, Boston and Miami. 

In a statement carrier had said it was talking to manufacturers about buying planes to serve new routes between various European airports and 12 to 14 American cities.

Michael O'Leary  previously said the airline has long been looking at long-haul flight plans, but is held back by a lack of aircraft availability

'European consumers want lower cost travel to the USA and the same for Americans coming to Europe. We see it as a logical development in the European market,' a spokesman said on Monday.

'The business plan is there but it's dependent on attaining viable long haul aircraft and we estimate that's 4 to 5 years away.'

Ryanair pilots had to wear oxygen masks as they made an emergency landing in Barcelona on Thursday after a fire extinguisher went off in the cockpit.

Passengers said the pilot and first officer were unable to breathe without the masks as halon - a liquefied, compressed gas - filled the confined space as the plane flew from London Stansted Airport to Valencia.

TV presenter and professional sailor Hannah White said that passengers suspected there was a serious problem, but they did not know the reason for the emergency landing until they arrived at Barcelona-El Prat Airport. 

Fire trucks greeted the Boeing 737 when it touched down shortly after 10:15am local time as passengers began to grasp the nature of the emergency. 

Ryanair described it as a 'minor fault'.

The airline first mooted the idea of offering transatlantic flights back in 2008 and board approval comes after the airline has invested 18 months in cleaning up its image and improving customer service. 

Last year, Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive, told the Irish Hotels Federation conference in Meath that Ryanair would offer the $15 flights to Boston and New York.

However, he admitted that passengers would pay extra for everything from meals to baggage.

He said: 'We can make money on 99 cent fares in Europe

'Not every seat will be ($15) of course; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats.'

In a separate conversation, Mr O'Leary admitted: 'We've had a business plan ready to roll for a transatlantic, low-fares airline.

'The difficulty is, I keep cautioning, is that there's no availability of long-haul aircraft for another four or five years.'

Ryanair isn't the only airline to consider offering budget transatlantic flights.

Previously, Sir Freddie Laker launched Skytrain in the late Seventies to offer 'no frills' flights to the US, but his carrier Lake Airways failed in 1982.

Zoom Airlines tried a similar concept in 2002 but was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2008.

Sir Freddie Laker revolutionised air travel with his idea for budget flights between Europe and the US, but his airline failed in 1982

More recently, Norwegian Airlines launched its own budget flights between London Gatwick, New York, Boston and Los Angeles from as little as £389 ($415) return. 

Icelandic carrier Wow Air, which will later this year launch £99 tickets from London Gatwick to two US cities with a stopover in Reykjavik.

Last summer Ryanair, Europe's largest budget carrier, launched a business class service. 

The airline said its 'business plus' fare would allow passengers flexible tickets,priority boarding and 'premium' seats – in the first five rows for quick boarding, or on exit rows with extra legroom.

It would also allow extra hold baggage allowance of one bag weighing up to 20kg, which can cost up to £75 on top of a standard ticket in high season on busy routes.
