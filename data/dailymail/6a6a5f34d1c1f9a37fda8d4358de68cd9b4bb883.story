The housekeeper at the center of the Indian diplomat scandal has broken her silence on the day that diplomat Devyani Khobragade was indicted on two criminal charges.

‘I would like to tell other domestic workers who are suffering as I did – you have rights and do not let anyone exploit you,’ she said.

Khobragade was charged by a federal grand jury in Manhattan with visa fraud and making false statements in a case that has triggered outcry both in the States and in India.

According to the New York Daily News, Khobragade left the country late Thursday night after being granted diplomatic immunity.

'She is pleased to be returning to her country,' lawyer Daniel Arshack said. 'Her head is held high. She knows she has done no wrong.'

Judge Shira Scheindlin granted Khobragade permission to leave the country at a hearing in Manhattan federal court Thursday.

If she returns to the country without immunity, she will be prosecuted.

In an impassioned statement her former housekeeper Richard revealed how her own desire to return to India had been denied.

She also told of the hopes with which she had arrived in the country in the first place.

‘When I decided to come to the United States my hope was to work 
for a few years to support my family and then return to India,' said Richard.

‘I 
never thought that things would get so bad here, that I would work so 
much that I did not have time to sleep or eat or have time to myself.

‘Because of this treatment, I requested that I return to India but that request was denied.’

She went on: ‘I would like to express my appreciation to everyone who has supported me through this process.’

Richard has been supported by Safe Horizon, a victim support agency that promotes justice for victims of crime and abuse in many forms including human trafficking.

Avaloy Lanning, Senior 
Director of the Anti-Trafficking Program at Safe Horizon applauded the 
steps taken by the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New 
York for indicting Khobragade on charges of visa fraud and making 
false statements in connection with Richard.

Richard welcomed the move as a demonstration of how seriously the U.S. government treats labor exploitation.

She
 said: ‘I hope this case sends a clear message to diplomats and consular
 officials that the U.S. will not tolerate the exploitation of workers and
 marks the beginning of an increase in prosecution of these cases.’

According to Safe Horizon, Richard's is not an isolated case but one that is ‘tragically common.’

Devyani Khobragade was arrested last 
month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her 
housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour

Devyani Khobragade was charged by a 
federal grand jury in Manhattan with visa fraud and making false 
statements.

She was accused of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her New York City housekeeper.

The
 indictment said Khobragade had made or multiple false representations 
to U.S. authorities, or caused them to be made, to obtain a visa for a 
personal domestic worker.

She planned to bring the worker to the 
United States in September 2012 when she worked at the Consulate General
 of India in New York, according to the indictment.

Khobragade,
 39, who was India's deputy consul general in New York, maintained her 
innocence to accusations that she claimed to pay her Indian maid $4,500 
per month but actually gave her far less than the U.S. minimum wage.

Her
 arrest last month sparked outrage in India after revelations that she 
was strip-searched and thrown in a cell with other criminal defendants 
before being released on $250,000 bail.

In
 a letter to the judge, prosecutors said there was no need for an 
arraignment because Khobragade had 'very recently' been given diplomatic
 immunity status and left the United States on Thursday.

The
 letter said the charges will remain pending until she can be brought to
 court to face them, either through a waiver of immunity or her return 
to the U.S. without immunity status.

'We
 will alert the court promptly if we learn that the defendant returns to
 the United States in a non-immune capacity, at which time the 
government will proceed to prosecute this case and prove the charges in 
the indictment,' the letter from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet 
Bharara said.

In an 
unusual statement last month, U.S. Attorney Bharara responded to 
what he described as misinformation and factual inaccuracy in the case 
by saying Khobragade was accused of creating false documents and lying 
to the U.S. government about what she was doing, including hiring a 
housekeeper who was working far more than the 40 hours per week she was 
contracted to work.

He also 
questioned why there was ‘precious little outrage’ about the treatment 
of the Indian housekeeper and her husband while there was so much about 
the alleged treatment of Khobragade.

He
 said his office's sole motivation was to uphold the law, protect 
victims and hold lawbreakers accountable, ‘no matter what their societal
 status and no matter how powerful, rich or connected they are'.

These
 developments came as it was revealed that a lawsuit filed months ago on 
behalf of the housekeeper alleged poor working conditions.

Philip Richard, Ms Richard's husband, filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in 
July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. 

Mr Richard also said the consular 
official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family 
saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug 
charges.

In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com,
 a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani 
Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions 
or keeping a person in bondage.'

The
 petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family 
several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire 
consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get 
them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.'

Mr
 Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in 
front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of 
what the woman took.

Mrs Richard's daughter Jennifer also 
wrote a letter to U.S. officials saying that her mother was unhappy and 
wanted to return to India but the diplomat refused to let her go.

Mr Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, 
because the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on 
foreign soil'.
