The conductor of a sickening racist chant by a University of Oklahoma fraternity has been identified as a graduate of an elite Catholic school in Dallas.

Parker Rice, 19, is  an OU freshman. It is believe he did not even live in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity house, which was shut down by the university on Monday. 

Rice graduated last year from the prestigious Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas.

A spokesman for the school's president, Mike Earsing, told Daily Mail Online: 'We know for sure it is one of our students and it is Parker Rice.'

Daily Mail Online was the first to confirm Rice's identity. 

On Tuesday, university president David Boren said he has expelled two students who were identified as 'leaders' of the racist chant. A university spokesman declined to say whether Parker was one of those two students.

Former classmates at the $16,000-a-year Catholic school Rice attended also confirmed to Daily Mail Online that he is the tuxedo-clad conductor seen getting out of his seat during the nine-second clip posted online on Sunday. 

Rice is featured the most prominently in the video, as he pumps his fist and encourages others aboard the chartered bus to sing along with the lyrics: 'There will never be a n***** in SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me. There will never be a n***** in SAE.'

The video, taken aboard a party bus Saturday night en route from the campus in Norman to the Oklahoma City Golf & Country Club, caused immediate outrage on Sunday when it was posed on social media. 

University officials responded by banning the fraternity from campus and demanding that members move out by midnight tonight.

Hundreds of students and faculty members marched on campus to protest the fraternity. 

On Tuesday morning Boran, the OU president who has given fiery rebukes of the fraternity and the racist song, announced that two members of the fraternity had been expelled. 

'I have emphasized that there is zero tolerance for this kind of threatening, racist behavior at the University of Oklahoma,' he said.

On Tuesday, Jesuit College Prep confirmed that Rice was the one leading the chant. School president Earsing sent a message to students, parents and alumni saying: 'In the recent video regarding OU and the SAE fraternity it appears that a graduate from Jesuit Dallas is leading the racist chant.'

'I am appalled by the actions in the video and extremely hurt by the pain this has caused our community.'  

He also vowed to identify all of the students who sang the chant and subject them to university punishment. On Monday he said that he was considering the use of criminal prosecution against the students involved.  

Rice's father Bob Rice is a vice president at real estate company Weeks Robinson Properties. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment by Daily Mail Online.

One former high school classmate who identified Parker Rice as one of the leaders of the chant told Daily Mail Online: 'In my honest opinion, he was following his frat brothers. I don't believe he is a racist, just wanted to fit in. It's fraternity culture. You do what the elders do so you fit in. He truly is a nice guy, but I do question things now.' 

The student, who did not want his name used also said: 'We have a strong sense of brotherhood at Jesuit and that's why many won't say anything about Jesuit but there were other Jesuit grads on that bus chanting.

'At school he was a football player, he was the funny guy that seemed to never take anything serious. I saw him as a follower who was afraid to step out of his friend group because of fear of not being accepted. He was privileged but most of the kids at Jesuit were.' 

University of Oklahoma President David Boren today expelled two students identified as playing a leadership role in the singing of a racist chant in connection with an SAE fraternity event. Boren said that the students who played a leadership role had created a hostile learning environment for others. 

The chant was not only heard by those on a bus, but also impacted the entire university community as it was also distributed through social media.

Boren said, 'I have emphasized that there is zero tolerance for this kind of threatening racist behavior at the University of Oklahoma. I hope that the entire nation will join us in having zero tolerance of such racism when it raises its ugly head in other situations across our country. I am extremely proud of the reaction and response expressed by our entire university family - students, faculty, staff, and alumni about this incident. 

'They are “Real Sooners” who believe in mutual respect for all. I hope that students involved in this incident will learn from this experience and realize that it is wrong to use words to hurt, threaten, and exclude other people. We will continue our investigation of all the students engaged in the singing of this chant. Once their identities have been confirmed, they will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.'

Rice's father Bob Rice is at senior vice president and the manager of the Texas office of Weeks Robinson, a major commercial and industrial real estate firm. According to his company biography, he has helped develop and lease 7million square feet of new industrial property. He graduated from Indiana University. 

Rice also has two brothers. One older brother graduated from Jesuit College Prep and University of Oklahoma. His younger brother is still at Jesuit College Prep.

At least three fraternity members can be seen standing on the bus singing the racist chant. Several more can bee seen cheering and hollering. 

At least one female voice can also be heard in the cheering. On Monday night, it was revealed that the Delta Delta Delta sorority was on the bus with fraternity members. 

The OU chapter of the sorority has denied that any of its sisters are under investigation by the university - though the headquarters for the sorority said officials were cooperating with OU investigation.
