It was a record-breaking first day of blow-out theatre sales, but the team behind The Hunger Games are ravenous for more. 

Everybody wants a piece of the film’s success, including Barbie doll maker Mattel’s, the latest to announce they are cashing in on the franchise.

A killer Barbie created 'specifically for the adult collector' will be launched in the near future.

Surpassing expectations: The Hunger Games pulled in $155 million in the U.S. and Canada on its opening night

Photos have not yet been released but 
the doll is said to be based on the film’s heroine Katniss Everdeen.

Played by Jennifer Lawrence, Everdeen is an arrow-slinging killing machine.

It will join previous Mattel’s dolls inspired by characters from films and television shows.

They include collectables of the the Mad Men characters, as well as vampire 
bride and groom dolls based on Bella and Edward’s wedding in vampire 
flick Twilight.

Merchandisers have been quick to pick
 up the phenomena of the Lionsgate adaption of Suzanne Collins' dystopia
 novel The Hunger Games.

Nail polishes - one for each of the 
film's 12 districts, and a cookbook inspired by the film have been launched already.

New York Sports Club is planning a Hunger Games workout class.

David Spitz, head of distribution at Lionsgate, said: 'This is the birth of a franchise. To launch in this fashion is mindboggling.'

The film was released on Friday, pulling
 in $155 million in the U.S. and Canada, beating the already high 
expectations set by Hollywood.
