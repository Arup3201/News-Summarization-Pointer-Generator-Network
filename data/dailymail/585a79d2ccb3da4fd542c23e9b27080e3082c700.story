High-rise housing blocks should be bulldozed and replaced with rows of traditional terraced housing to cut crime and raise living standards for the poorest in British society, a key report has found.

Homes modelled on those built across the UK for centuries are how 'people want to live' and would reduce their stress and even save their marriages, influential think-tank the Policy Exchange said today.

At least 140,000 households with children live on the second floor or 
above in England, despite evidence that multi-storey flats attract 
higher crime rates and social breakdown, their paper found.

Vision: Planners believed that high-rise blocks like these on the Heygate Estate in South London were better, but an influential think tanks says they all should be bulldozed and replaced with terraced housing

Back to the future: Traditional terraced Victorian, like these in Greenwich, London, are 'how people want to live', the Policy Exchange say

These tower blocks, built across the UK in the last 70 years, have become 'no-go areas' and must be 'ripped down', they say.

Around 300,000 of these flats have been put up since the 1950s, but they could fit 600,000 homes and flats in the same footprint, the Policy Exchange claim.

Using that calculation London alone 260,000 new homes could be built in seven years by demolishing tower blocks in the capital.

The paper's author, Nicholas Boys Smith, warned that residents of such estates - mostly social tenants - suffered more stress, mental health problems and marriage breakdowns.

Report: The document shows how large numbers of homes can be built in the footprint of housing blocks

Changes: Huge numbers of traditional terraces were demolished to make way for high-rise blocks but they should build them again to cut crime, the report says

Bygone: Living in a house, with only two storeys is good for health and well-being, according to the author

High-rises could also pose fire dangers and were more expensive to build and maintain, he said.

'It's time we ripped down the mistakes of the past and started building proper streets where people want to live', Mr Boys Smith said.

'We must not repeat mistakes by building housing which makes people's lives a misery.

'Bulldozing the high-rise tower blocks and no-go zone estates and replacing them with terraced homes and low-rise flats is the best way to build both the number and the quality of homes that we need.'

And it appears the Government, at least in part, agrees.

A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: 'Ministers have scrapped the last government's Whitehall targets which forced local authorities to build high-density flats rather than family homes and attractive terraces.

'Good design is vital to avoid the mistakes of the last century that lead to ugly and crime-ridden tower blocks.

'Communities can now use their own Neighbourhood Plans to decide themselves what type and design of homes are built in their area and their councils should actively support them in this process.'

It was the estate that Tony Blair visited to make his first keynote speech as Prime Minister in 1997.

And now the Aylesbury Estate in Walworth, South London, is in the middle of a huge Â£1.5bn regeneration, but not into the terraced housing that the Policy Exchange suggests.

Mr Blair said at the time that he would provide hope and new opportunities for Britain's army of 'forgotten people', and famously waved from a balcony on the notorious estate promising them new homes. 13 years later the work started.

Prince William and a party of his Eton classmates were even sent there to witness first hand how the other half live on one of London's most rundown estates. His visit was part of an A-level geography field trip.

But now the estate of 2,700 homes is being redeveloped (below). The buildings are 
being taken down as they were constructed, rather than with a wrecking 
ball, to minimise disruption.

It was built between 1967 and 1977 as an attempt to link estates between Peckham and Elephant and Castle.

It became renowned as an area of deprivation, blighted by crime and anti-social behaviour. Television programmes such as The Bill and Spooks would often choose it as a backdrop when filming gritty scenes.

Three sites on the estate are being developed, with about 4,000 new homes, 50 per cent of which will be social housing.

The new development will feature homes to rent and buy, and is designed to minimise the number of potential crime hotspots.
