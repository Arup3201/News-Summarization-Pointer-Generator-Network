Real Madrid legend Fernando Morientes says the club's fans need more from record signing Gareth Bale.

Bale is set to start for Real in Saturday night's Champions League final against cross-city rivals Atletico.

Carlo Ancelotti's men, still reeling from Atletico winning La Liga, are in search of the famous 'La Decima' - the club's tenth European Cup.

And with Bale hoping to star in that quest, Morientes - winner of three Champions Leagues with Real - says the Welsh forward needs to do more after his £86million move.

'He's been up and down this season,' said Morientes.

'He's got a good amount of goals and assists but Real Madrid fans need a bit more from him.

'However, it's only his first season so we can judge next year.'

The former striker also believes Ancelotti's job may not be safe even if Real do lift the trophy, but insists it has been a positive season for the club.

He said: 'Even if he wins it's difficult at Real Madrid to keep his job.

'But he had a great season, winning the Copa del Rey and getting to this final. It's been impressive whatever happens in Lisbon.

'La Decima is not life or death, but it's the most important thing for the club, the city and the supporters.

'It's the biggest competition in Europe and Real Madrid are the most important club in the world, so it's a necessity.

'Ancelotti will play the same way he has done all season.

'A team like Real Madrid doesn't have to change their strategy because of the opposition.'
