Claims: Out of work equity research analyst Todd J. Remis says photographers missed 15 crucial minutes of his wedding

Disgruntled groom Todd J. Remis is suing photographers who took his wedding photos and is demanding his $48,000 nuptials be re-staged - even though he is divorced and his ex-wife may have moved to Latvia.

The out of work equity research analyst from Manhattan, New York, wants the entire wedding replayed to capture the final 15 minutes of his wedding to Milena Grzibovska, which took place in 2003.

Mr Remis alleges that established firm H & H Photographers of Irvington, Westchester County, missed the last dance of the day and the moment his new bride tossed her bouquet.

And he has demanded in court papers 
that the firm repay him the $4,100 cost of the wedding photos and that 
he is awarded $48,000 to allow him to re-enact the day and fly in guests
to New York.

The 
photographic studio have pointed out however that the bride is believed 
to have moved back to her native Latvia and has proved uncontactable.

Stunning: The Castle on the Hudson where Remis married. He wants his 2003 wedding re-staged at the upmarket venue and that the photographers from the day to foot the bill.

The couple married in front of 40 guests at Castle on the Hudson in Tarrytown, Westchester, but separated in 2008. Their divorce was finalised in 2010.

Photos of the day show a happy bride and groom surrounded by family, including the bride's mother, Irina, and her sister Alina, who travelled from Latvia for the occasion.

But a few months after the contract to photograph and video the event had been signed, Mr Remis complained to the firm that the three man crew had missed the last 15 minutes of his wedding day.

Photo company founder Curt Fried, who sold his half of the business to his son Dan, right, says Mr Remis doesn't even know where his wife lives now

In his lawsuit Mr Remis argues that the 
images he saw were 'unacceptable to colour, lighting, poses, 
positioning' and that a video of the event, which he expected to be six 
hours long was only two.

He testified: 'I need to have the wedding recreated exactly as it was so that the remaining 15 percent of the wedding that was not shot can be shot.

'We would like to have it documented for eternity, for us and our families.'

But photographic boss Curt Fried, 87, who handed over his half of the firm to his son in 2004, said: 'He wants to fly his ex-wife back and he doesn't even know where she lives.'

Mr Fried maintains that Mr Remis was given 400 proofs to allow him to choose final images for the wedding album.

Mr Remis claims 'the office kept everything'.

A 2004 magazine article, however, published a photo of the bride and groom, which Mr Fried says his firm took.

H & H Photographers are a 65-year-old studio known among Bronx residents for chronicling weddings, bar mitzvahs and communions.

Mr Fried's son, Dan, added that he 
and his father were paying their legal bills and that he considered the 
case to be 'an abuse of the legal system.'

They say their bill has already topped the sum that Mr Remis is seeking from them.

The
lawyer acting for Mr Remis works for the same legal firm, Goodwin 
Proctor, where his father, Samuel M., is a litigation partner.

He states he is paying his own legal fees.

Justice
Doris Ling-Cohan of the State Supreme Court in Manhatten has dismissed 
most of the grounds for the lawsuit, which was filed in 2009 just before
the statute of limitation was about to expire.

But she has allowed it to proceed to determine whether there had been a breach of contract.

She
ruled against claims of 'infliction of emotional distress' and said in 
her opinion earlier this year, quoting Barbra Streisand's classic song 
'The Way We Were': 'This is a case which it appears that the "misty 
watercolour memories" and the "scattered pictures of the smiles .. left 
behind' at the wedding were more important than the real thing.'

The next court hearing into the case is scheduled for next Thursday.

Mr.
Remis, who said at his deposition that he has not been employed since 
2008, his lawyer, Frederick R. McGowen, and Ms. Grzibovska have not been
contactable.
