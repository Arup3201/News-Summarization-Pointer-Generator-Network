The boyfriend of a Maine nurse who treated Ebola patients and successfully fought a quarantine has withdrawn from the college where he was a senior nursing student.

Ted Wilbur withdrew Friday from the University of Maine at Fort Kent, said Ray Phinney, associate dean of student life and development. He declined further comment.

Wilbur says he was forced to stay away from campus while his girlfriend was in the news amid attempts to quarantine her after she returned from treating Ebola patient in West Africa.

But university officials contend he voluntarily agreed to stay off campus.

'I wish that his university had showed more leadership in all of this. I think they only fueled the flames of confusion and misinformation. That's been really disappointing for us,' his girlfriend, Kaci Hickox, told The Associated Press.

After returning from Sierra Leone where she worked with Doctors Without Borders treating Ebola patients, nurse Hickox publicly challenged a quarantine order by the state of Maine

Hickox contended there was no need to isolate her.

A state judge sided with her, saying she poses no health threat because she's showing no symptoms.
