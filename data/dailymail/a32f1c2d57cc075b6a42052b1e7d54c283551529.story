Charged: Dale Cregan  has been charged over the deaths of PC Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone

The one-eyed man arrested over the fatal shooting of two unarmed policewomen checked into a celebrity-loved luxury spa resort while police hunted for him, it was claimed today.

Dale Cregan was last night charged with four murders, including those of PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes and a father and son.

After he handed himself in following Tuesday’s outrage Cregan is due to appear in a Manchester court this morning. David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23, were both shot dead in separate incidents earlier this year.

But before the suspect was grabbed by Greater Manchester Police after a five-week hunt, he is thought to have stayed in the plush Plas Coch resort on the island of Anglesey, north Wales.

It is popular with footballers like Michael and former Liverpool and England star John Barnes.

Around a month ago the police got a tip off he might be there but after staking it out for several days they failed to spot him.

A week later a holidaymaker then told a hotel worker they were sure he had been there, as she had seen him splashing around happily in the luxury heated swimming pool.

'It was a woman who spotted him. I was worried about it. About a week after that another family came in and said they thought they saw him wandering around,' a source told The Sun.

Police rushed back but couldn't find him, the source added.

On its website Plas Coch promises 'Fun, relaxation and happy memories' and a 'place to escape the stress of daily life and rebalance your wellbeing' - all with stunning views of water and Snowdonia.

Cregan is also thought to have spent some time in Herne Bay, on the Kent coast, almost 300 miles from Manchester as police looked for him.

Cregan was also charged with four attempted murders. PCs Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, were killed after receiving a call to investigate a burglary at a terraced house in Mottram, Manchester.

When they got there, they were shot dead by a waiting gunman who then threw a hand grenade.

Last night, Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor for the North West, said: ‘The tragic events this week in which Police Constables Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes lost their lives in the line of duty have shocked and appalled the whole country.‘

‘I have today authorised the police to charge 29-year-old Dale Cregan with their murders and with the murders of Mark Short, who was killed at the Cotton Tree Inn in Droylsden on 25 May, and David Short, who was killed at his home in Clayton on 10 August.

‘Cregan has also been charged with the attempted murders of Michael Belcher, Ryan Pridding and John Short on 25 May and Sharon Hark on 10 August.’

Cregan is set to appear in custody at Manchester magistrates’ court this morning. 

The wave of murders that swept across Manchester are thought to be the result of a bitter family feud.

PCs Hughes and Bone were the innocent victims of the deadly rivalry.

It is believed the feud stems from a 
vicious fight for control of low-level organised crime in east 
Manchester and centres around the control of the ‘doors’ in pubs and 
clubs, protection rackets and the trade in cannabis.

It is thought it may have initially been sparked by an alleged assault on a woman.

But the dispute spilled over into bloodshed when Mark Short was gunned down in the Cotton Tree Inn.

It is understood the gunman had intended to ‘kneecap’ him as he played pool but Short bent down and was blasted in the neck.

David Short vowed to take revenge and threatened to murder relatives of his son’s killer in retaliation.

He was later murdered in front of his house by a gunman armed with a semi-automatic pistol and grenades.

Sources say the feud stems from 
bitter rivalry between the Short and Wilkinson families. Anthony 
Wilkinson, 33, is currently in custody awaiting trial, charged with the 
murder of David Short.

Since the shooting of David Short in 
August, several members of both families have received Osman warnings – 
official tip-offs from the police that their lives are in danger.

Floral tributes are laid by wellwishers at the scene where the two policewomen were fatally injured

Earlier Sir Peter Fahy said: ‘There 
is this wider web of organised crime we have got in Greater Manchester. 
Some people are involved in that, some know about that and more turn a 
blind eye to that.

‘We have businesses that launder 
money coming from that and that is rooted, whether you like it or not, 
in local neighbourhoods and local estates.

Sir Peter said this level of organised crime operates ‘just below the radar’.

He said: ‘There is also intimidation and fear from organised criminality.’
