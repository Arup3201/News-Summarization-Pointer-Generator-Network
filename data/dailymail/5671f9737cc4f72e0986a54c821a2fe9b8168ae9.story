Fire officials say a 22-year-old woman fell down an elevator shaft at Boston's Fenway Park.

The Boston Fire Department says the woman fell down the shaft Friday night.

The department tweeted that the fourth floor doors apparently opened and the woman fell on to the roof of the elevator at the second floor.

Rescuers reached the woman through a hatch in the elevator's roof and transported her to a hospital. Her condition was not immediately available.

Fire officials say a state elevator inspector was called to the scene.

In the game, the Red Sox lost to the Detroit Tigers 1-0.

Detroit has baseball's best record at 25-12, winning 13 of its last 16 games and nine in a row on the road.

Pitcher Max Scherzer is a major reason why.

He faced the minimum through three innings before rain halted play with one out in the top of the fourth.

While it definitely put a damper on the marquee matchup of aces, the delay barely slowed Scherzer, who stayed warm by throwing in the cages and was ready to go when the game restarted ahead of schedule after a brief rain delay.

'For me, once I was able to get loose, I felt the same,' he said.

Had the delay lasted longer, Scherzer's night may have prematurely come to an end.

The team says it plans to release more details about the young woman's condition when they become available.
