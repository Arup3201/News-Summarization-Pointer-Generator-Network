Russia issued a thinly-veiled warning to Moldova not to forge closer links with Europe after pro-Western parties sneaked an election victory yesterday. 

The three main pro-Europe parties in Moldova have about 44 per cent of the vote, despite the pro-Russian Socialist party receiving the highest number of votes in yesterday's election.

This will see them hold 57-58 seats in Moldova's 101-seat parliament, while the two pro-Russian opposition parties will get 43-44 seats.

Deputy Prime Minister of Russia accused Moldova of rigging the election results by banning one pro-Russian party on the eve of the vote.

He also criticised the country for depriving about 500,000 residents of the Russian-backed breakaway region of Trans-Dniester from voting. 

He said: 'Kishinev (Russian name for Moldova capital) better think, "Comrades have you chosen the right road?"'

Moldovan residents voted in the crucial election yesterday, which saw the three pro-European parties record the highest number of votes - it is thought they will now form a 'grand coalition'

In the election results, the pro-Russian Socialist Party led with more than 21 per cent of the vote. 

The Communist Party - a Soviet era survivor that still uses the hammer and sickle as its symbol -  was in third with almost 18 per cent.

In second place were the pro-EU Liberal Democrats with 19 per cent. The party wants Moldova to achieve EU candidate status by 2017 and full membership by 2020. 

Two other pro-Europe parties - the Democrats and the Liberals - are on 16 per cent and 9 per cent respectively.

It is now thought they will try to form a pro-European 'grand coalition' although that is likely to face opposition from Vladimir Putin's Russia.

The elections have taken on greater significance as Moldova, one of Europe's smallest and poorest countries, borders on war-torn Ukraine.

Ukraine has been in crisis since November last year, when the former leadership made a last-minute U-turn, refusing to sign a landmark association and free trade deal with the EU - under huge pressure from Russia.

That resulted in mass protests in Ukraine that toppled President Viktor Yanukovych, and the country later signed the EU deal. 

But the protests, in turn, led to Russia annexing southern Crimea peninsula in March and backing rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Since then, the two countries have been locked in a bitter conflict that is the most dangerous to grip Europe since the wars in the former Yugoslavia.

Russia believes NATO is destabilising northern Europe and the Baltic states, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Meshkov has said.

He has accused NATO of  strengthening ties with east European countries that were once dominated by the Soviet Union and Moscow.

Mr Meshkov said: 'NATO are trying to destabilise the most stable region in the world - northern Europe.

'The endless military exercises, transferring aircraft capable of carrying nuclear arms to the Baltic states. This reality is extremely negative.'

He added: 'The Russian authorities are and will be taking every step to firmly safeguard the security of Russia and its citizens ... no matter which part of our country it concerns.' 

Moldova’s breakaway pro-Russian enclave of Transdniestria - which did not take part in the election - gives Russia a potential foot-hole in the country of 3.5 million.

However, Moscow has so far shown no desire to intervene.

But it has shown its displeasure for the pro-EU policies by prohibiting imports of wines, vegetables and meat from a struggling economy that relies on agricultural exports.

However, analysts say that with Moldova already gaining from the recent EU deal that enables its citizens to travel visa-free to western Europe - the pro-European sentiment in the country will be hard to overcome.  

A three-party coalition, led by prime minister Iurie Leanca’s Liberal Democrats, has seen Moldova establish closer ties with Europe since 2009. 

He has said he wants full EU membership for Moldova by 2020.

Turnout at yesterday's election was just under 56 per cent, the central electoral commission said, out of a total of 2.7 million eligible voters.
