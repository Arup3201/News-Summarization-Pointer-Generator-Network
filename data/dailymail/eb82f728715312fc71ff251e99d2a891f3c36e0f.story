A 17-year-old clung to the edge of a 110ft cliff for 30 minutes after trying to rescue his dog.

The teenager clambered down the perilous drop at midday yesterday after his 18-month-old British Bulldog, Rio, fell down and landed on a narrow ledge.

But in his haste, the boy slipped and ended up hanging from a piece of rock as his older brother looked on, helpless.

Perilous drop: The boy, 17, tried to climb down to the ledge to get his British Bulldog but slipped

After minutes of calling for help, a coastguard officer arrived and was winched 40ft down to where the teenager was hanging.

He was placed into a safety harness and hoisted back to the top of the 150ft cliff along with the dog, which was put into a special bag.

His rescuers said that the teenager couldn't have held onto to the jagged rockÂ  in Charmouth, Devon, for much longer and would have been severally injured or killed had he fallen.

The dramatic incident happened while the boy and his family were holidaying in a caravan half-a-mile from the cliff.

Graham Turner, of the Lyme Regis coastguard team, said: 'The younger brother went down after the dog but he slid down and had to dig his fingers into a rock to stop himself.

'He slid down to a ledge and was left clinging on. His feet were over the edge of the ledge and it was a near vertical drop after that.

After minutes of calling, just holding a rock on the cliff in Devon, coastguards arrived to winch him up the 110 feet

The dog, Rio, survived unscathed, but pet owners in Devon have been warned to keep them on a leash

'He was in serious trouble and imminent danger. He would have been killed or severely hurt had he fallen further.

'He had been there for 30 minutes and another five or ten minutes and he would have had to let go so we found him in the nick of time. He was terrified.'

The victim, who hasn't been named, was wearing just shorts and a T-shirt and had to be treated at the top of the cliffs by paramedics for shock and cold.

Rio the dog survived the drama completely unscathed.

Julia Gosling, a spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, warned dog owners to keep their pets on leads when near cliffs.

She said: 'This case highlights why we do dog rescues because people can put their lives at risk when they try and do it.

'The coastline can be an exciting place for dogs but even the most obedient dogs can do something unexpected at times.

'Our message is to always keep your dogs on a lead near cliffs.'
