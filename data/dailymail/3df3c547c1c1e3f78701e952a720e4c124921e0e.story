The parents of a middle school student in Missouri claim their son was told he could not read his Bible at school.

Justin Grandstaff says his son Loyal was told by his teacher at Bueker Middle School in Marshall, that reading his 'favorite' book was not allowed.

The 12-year-old says he took the book to school to read in his spare time and he was not reading aloud or talking about it with his classmates.

The parents of a middle school student in Missouri claim their son, Loyal, (pictured) was told he could not read his Bible at school

'I was just reading, just reading because I had free time. 

'A time to do what I wanted to, so I just broke it out and read,' he told FOX4KC.

When Loyal told his parents about the incident, they were outraged.

Father: Justin Grandstaff (pictured) says 'I feel like it violated his freedom of religion but also his freedom of speech'

'I feel like it violated his freedom of religion but also his freedom of speech,' said Mr Grandstaff.  

'There's kids walking around disrespecting their teachers, kids walking around cussing and everything else and they're practically getting into no trouble at all,' he added.

But Bueker principal Lance Tobin tells Yahoo Parenting.

'It was a misunderstanding,' declining to explain what exactly happened. 'Bibles are not banned from school,' he added.

Any student who wishes to read the Bible may, he says, as long as it's during what's been 'designated as free time.'
