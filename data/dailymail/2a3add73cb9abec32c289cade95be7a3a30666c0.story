A Chinese textile worker laid off from his factory job has taken up an unlikely new career - building submarines.

Zhang Wuyi from Hanyang in central China's land-locked Hubei province is currently testing the functions of his latest invention.

Mr Zhang has been building submarines since 2008 and in that time has created several different versions - despite having no background in engineering.

captures sea cucumbers at his workshop in Wuhan, Hubei province

Final tests: Mr Zhang began his business building subs in 2008 after he was laid 
off from his textile factory job - despite having no experience in engineering he has made and sold several different versions already

Incredibly, not only have his previous submarines worked as advertised, but the 38-year-old has managed to make a living selling them to fisherman and water theme parks.

The former textile worker began making his first sub after the factory he worked for went bust and he was made redundant.

'I didn't known anything about submarine building, but designed with my imagination,' he said.

With several fellow engineers, he has since designed and built eight miniature submarines mainly designed for harvesting aquatic products, such as sea cucumber.

The wrought-iron submarines have enough room for two people, a diving depth of 66-98ft, and can travel for up to 20 hours, local media reported.

Each is equipped with video cameras to observe the underwater environment and suction tubes to harvest submarine wildlife.

But is it safe? The wrought-iron submarines have enough room for two people, a diving depth of 66-98ft, and can travel for up to 20 hours. They are also equipped with external cameras and suction tubes

Inspiration: This time last year Mr Zhang was building his subs in a makeshift workshop in an abandoned building in his home town of Hanyang. Now his business is based at a boat yard in the regional capital Wuhan

My Wuyi's first customer was sea cucumber farmer Cong Zhijie, a fisherman in Dalian, who bought one of the contraptions in 2011 for 100,000 yuan (Â£10,650).

'I was brave enough to be the first user of his submersible, but that machine helped me to catch up to 50 kilograms of sea cucumbers in 40 minutes,' said Mr Zhijie.

News of Mr Wuyi's incredible entrepreneurialism first broke this time last year, when Chinese media showed him working on a red-painted sub in a makeshift workshop in a disused building in Hanyang.

It is a mark of his success that his latest creation, emblazoned with a patriotic red star, is being tested in a boat yard in Wuhan, the regional capital.

The test operations, pictured yesterday, are taking place in an artificial pool in the boat yard.
