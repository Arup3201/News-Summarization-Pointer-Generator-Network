Taxpayers paid £1million to a suspected terrorist accused of going to al-Qaeda training camps and planning attacks on American and Jewish targets.

Feroz Abbasi was one of 16 men held at Guantanamo Bay who were paid a total of £20million compensation by the UK to settle claims of complicity in their rendition and detention.

U.S. forces captured the 34-year-old from Croydon, South London, in Afghanistan and held him in a series of secret prisons until finally releasing him from Guantanamo in 2005.

Compensated: Feroz Abbasi, who was paid around £1million by the UK government to settle a lawsuit over its complicity in his extraordinary rendition and detention in Guantanamo Bay after his arrest in Afghanistan

It has now emerged that an al-Qaeda 'supergrass' told officials in 2004 that Abbasi had been helped travel to Afghanistan by extremist cleric Abu Hamza 'to receive jihad training'.

The revelations, contained in documents relating to Hamza's trial in the U.S., have prompted questions over the decision to pay compensation to Abbasi when there were claims he was at the heart of an Islamic terrorist group.

Robin Simcox, an al-Qaeda expert at the Henry Jackson Society, a hawkish neoliberal thinktank, told the Sunday Telegraph he found Abbasi's pay-off 'troubling'.

'The Government agreed a settlement with the Guantánamo detainees because it believed it was better than a lengthy litigation process in which secret intelligence would be exposed and national security could be seriously damaged,' said Mr Simcox.

'However, there was never an admittance of liability that the security services had done anything wrong. In Feroz Abbasi’s case, the facts have always pointed towards his involvement with dangerous, extremist causes, which makes his payout all the more troubling.'

Detainees at Guantanamo: An alleged confession could not be used as evidence after claims that Abbasi was tortured while in U.S. custody

A British citizen who moved to South London from Uganda when he was just eight, Abbasi was brought up a moderate Muslim but gradually became more fervent and began attending the radical Finsbury Park mosque in 2000.

He was arrested in Kunduz, Afghanistan, by Northern Alliance forces in December 2001, at the age of 23, and handed over to U.S. troops, who shipped him to Afghanistan in 2002.

Despite repeated claims he would face a U.S. military tribunal, Abbasi was repatriated to Britain just under three years later along with Moazzam Begg, Martin Mubanga and Richard Belmar, and then released when no charges were brought.

An alleged handwritten confession could not be used as evidence in British courts after claims that Abbasi was tortured during his time in U.S. custody.

He and his fellow detainees went in to sue the UK government for complicity in his illegal rendition and detention by the U.S. and in 2010 a secret deal was reached with both sides signing confidentiality agreements.

Part of the settlement was a bumper compensation pay-out for the men, the details of which remain secret and will not be discussed by the Cabinet Office.

But new documents prepared by U.S. prosecutors for the trial of Abu Hamza, the firebrand preacher at the Finsbury Park mosque, claim that Abbasi was close to the heart of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.

Saajid Badat, an would-be shoe-bomber who turned supergrass in exchange for a shorter sentence, claims he met Abbasi in 2001 in Kandahar.

He says he looked after Abbasi in Afghanistan and acted as a translator between him and 'two of al-Qaeda's most senior leaders' who, he claims, asked Abbasi if he would be willing to attack 'American and Jewish targets'.

The U.S. Justice Department says Badat first provided his testimony about Abbasi's role in conspiracies with Abu Hamza in 2004 and that another, unnamed, witness has corrobarated the account.

At Hamza's trial in New York, Badat said he saw Abbasi at an al-Qaeda training camp in 2001, but admitted under cross-examination that he only saw him using a spade to dif holes.

Hamza denies charges of trying to set up a terrorist training camp in the U.S., of supporting al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and providing assistance to militants who kidnapped 16 Western tourists in Yemen in 1998.

He has claimed he was merely a spokesman for terrorist groups 'like Gerry Adams with the IRA.' The trial continues.

Since returning to Britain, Abbasi has married and become a father after studying at a London university.
