Eoin Collins, five, eats anything from stones to fabric conditioner due to a rare disorder

A five-year-old boy eats everything from stones, sand, soil and mortar to toilet paper, sponge, paint and fabric conditioner due to a rare disorder.

Eoin Collins, from Chester, has an impulsive and untreatable craving disorder called Pica - a appetite for non-food substances.

He was diagnosed  three years ago when he started to chew on sand from the beach in Cornwall during a family holiday.

His insatiable appetite means he consumes cleaning products, wallpaper and has even started to chew on his nine-year-old brother Finn's Comic Relief red nose.

His disorder keeps his single mother-of-three Ceri Collins on her toes and she has to watch him constantly to keep him from eating something that could make him seriously ill.

Mrs Collins, 32, a childminder, said: 'You can't turn your back on him for a second without him sticking his hand in the sand or mud.

'If I leave cleaning products out for a second then he will eat them or try to drink them and he's always picking paint off the walls.

'And I had to give a plant that a friend gave to me as a present to my mum because he was always at the soil.

'He will eat literally anything.'

Eoin has picked paint off the walls all around their home and risks eating his way through to his grandmother's house next door.

Mrs Collins has to keep all potentially fatal products on the top shelf and even uses stair gates to keep her son out of  cupboards.

Recently, Eoin has developed a taste for sponges and even toilet paper - and his cravings show no sign of stopping.

She said: 'I just thought that it was a phase and that he would grow out of it when I first saw him eat sand.

'The real danger is that he will eat something that will make him sick.

'But thankfully that hasn't happened yet and he's not gained weight.

'But Eoin has limited speech so he can't tell me why he does it at all and it's really stressful.'

Pica, the Latin word for 'magpie', is most common in people with learning disabilities and during pregnancy.

It can cause a range of serious complications if the person is eating something that is poisonous or indigestible.

They can also damage their teeth, or have part of the body obstructed – something often seen in people who eat hair.

Eoin drives his mother crazy by eating paint and mortar from the walls of his home. Recently, he has developed cravings for toilet paper and sponges

Pica is an eating disorder that is characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value.

These can include stones, sand, paint and dirt.

It is most common in people with learning disabilities and during pregnancy.

It can cause a range of serious complications if the person is eating something that is poisonous or indigestible.

These include being poisoned by toxic ingredients and having a part of the body obstructed (which is often seen in people who eat hair).

It can also lead to excessive calorie intake, but also nutritional deprivation if the person eats a substance with no nutritional value instead of nutritious foods.

The person can also damage their teeth and be infected with parasites.

It can lead to weight gain if they are consuming more calories, or a deficiency ff they are replacing nutritious food with substances with no nutritional value.

Eoin has one-on-one assistance at Broughton Primary School in Chester to keep him from eating bizarre items when he is away from his mother.

But he has to be watched like a hawk when he visits friends' houses as he will .

Mrs Collins said: 'His cravings can be horrendous some weeks and when he goes to people’s houses he sometimes goes straight to the little drawer in their washing machine to scoop up the fabric conditioner.'

Eoin has a brother, Finn, nine, and sister Niamh, two, who are not affected by his bizarre cravings.

Mrs Collins said: 'Both his brother and sister are brilliant with him.

'Niamh will sometimes try and copy him and start eating bubbles in the bath and stuff like that.

Ceri Collins, 32, has to supervise her son constantly as she is terrified he will eat something harmful

'But at least she doesn't like the taste - Eoin is not bothered by taste at all and he can't help the urge.

'I don't know what it is - whether it is the texture or something else - but I just have to try and distract him to stop him eating things he shouldn't.'

Eoin's cravings - especially for mud and moss - have made it difficult for him to go outside to play and last summer, he was stuck indoors.

Mrs Collins is now fundraising to raise £8,000 to create a garden of 'non-edible' materials.

It will enable him to play outside without close supervision which he needs to prevent him from hunting down his favourite 'food' - moss.

Mrs Collins said: 'He will get more freedom when he goes outside which is really important - it will be a massive step for his independence.

'He loves to be outside and people have been really kind by donating things and raising money for the new garden.

'He's a rascal but is really loving. Unfortunately he can't go outside on his own much because of the condition but hopefully that is about to change.
