Aaron Hernandez's housekeepers testified on Monday about finding guns in the 'man cave' of his home and how the ex-NFL star's fiancée threatened them with deportation if they cooperated with authorities following Odin Lloyd's murder.

Marila Prinholato was the first cleaner to take the stand on Monday. She testified that she cleaned at the North Attleboro mansion in Massachusetts every Tuesday for up to seven hours.

She said that she would sometimes smell 'marijuana' at the home and that the bed in the 'man cave' appeared to have been slept in on several occasions.

Ms Prinholato also testified that during one round of cleaning, a gun fell out from under the mattress.

The cleaner then testified that a different weapon fell out of Hernandez's pants pocket when a colleague went to hang them up.

She added that she saw both guns at the home on the seven occasions she worked there. 

Ms Prinholato told the jury that after Odin Lloyd was found murdered on June 17, 2013, around a mile from Hernandez's home, the Pats star and his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, put pressure on her to sign a legally-binding confidentially document. She did not sign it.

Hernandez betrayed little emotion as he watched the witnesses testify in court on Monday. 

Odin Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, was also in the public gallery at the Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, as she has been each day since the start of trial.

Hernandez's defense attorney, Michael Fee, then got up to cross-examine Ms Prinholato.

Fee said that the confidentiality agreement was given to Ms Prinholato before the murder and that the defendant had passed along one he got from another Pats player.

Grazielli Silva, who ran the cleaning company used by Hernandez, then took the stand. 

Ms Grazi said that she learned of the confidentiality agreement three weeks before the murder but did not receive the form until after the shooting death of Lloyd. Like her colleague, she didn't sign it. 

Hernandez's lawyer then asked Ms Grazi about her U.S. immigration status to which she confirmed she was illegal.

The defense then asked if she thought cooperating with prosecutors would help her stay in the U.S

At the beginning of court proceedings on Monday, witnesses heard loud bangs that sounded like fireworks in a Massachusetts industrial park where the bullet-riddled body of a man ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez is accused of fatally shooting was found hours later, they testified on Monday.

Two employees of Needletech Products Inc, a surgical needle manufacturing company in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, said they heard the sounds between 3am and 3.30am on June 17, 2013, during breaks from their overnight shifts at the company.

'I heard a loud bang, four or five times,' said Barbara Chan, a Needletech machine operator who had been taking a nap in her car. 

'I thought it was fireworks... It was two slow ones and three fast ones.'

Another Needletech employee, Michael Ribeiro, was listening to the radio in his pickup truck outside the company's facility when he said he heard 'a loud banging sound, like fireworks going off'.

The body of Odin Lloyd, a semiprofessional football player who had been dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée, was found by a teenage jogger a short distance away later that day.

Lloyd, 27, had been shot six times and police found five empty .45-caliber shell casings nearby.

A single .45-caliber shell was found in a dumpster at a rental car agency, removed from a car Hernandez returned. Authorities have not located the gun used in the slaying.

Hernandez, who lived less than a mile from the industrial park, has been charged with Lloyd's murder and various firearms offenses. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.

Hernandez, 25, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was cut from the team shortly after being arrested in June 2013.

Prosecutors contend Hernandez and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home in the early hours of June 17, 2013, before driving him to the industrial area where his body was found.

Wallace and Ortiz also have been charged and will be tried separately. All three men have pleaded not guilty.

Associate Justice Susan Garsh reconsidered an earlier ruling to exclude text messages between Lloyd and his sister, saying the sister could testify that texts were sent at certain times, but not about their contents.

Hernandez will face a second trial later this year on charges he killed two Cape Verdean men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012.
