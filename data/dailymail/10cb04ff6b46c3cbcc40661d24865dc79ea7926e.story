Meet the lone female football fan who has been granted special permission to travel to Saudi Arabia and sit amongst 65,000 men so she can watch her beloved Western Sydney Wanderers.

Kate Durnell is one of just 14 Wanderers supporters who will travel to the conservative Muslim country for the second leg of the Asian Champions League final against Saudi Arabian heavyweights Al-Hilal on Sunday. 

The 20-year-old from Constitution Hill in Sydney's west will have to cover up in traditional Islamic attire as she sits amongst the  predominately male football fans at King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh.

'I've had to buy an abaya, which is a dress, and a hijab,' Ms Durnell told the Parramatta Advertiser.

'It's kind of empowering to be able to be part of something so significant as a woman, and a Wanderers fan.

'My mum is freaking out a bit. She isn't so comfortable about travelling to a strange country but this is going to be an adventure.' 

The Wanderers were hoping for a contingent of about 200 of their supporters to spur them on against Al-Hilal on Sunday morning (AEDT).

But a club spokesperson said a strict and complex process for obtaining Saudi Arabia visas, along with the travel cost, had reduced the touring party leaving from Sydney to 13 men and one woman.

Under conservative Saudi law, single women must be in the company of their husband or a male family member to be able to obtain a visa.

Ms Durnell, who will be accompanied by her dad Richard, had to receive a formal invite from Saudi Arabia, get permission from the Asian Champions League and obtain a strict visa in order to watch the match.

The Wanderers are on the verge of becoming the first Australian football team to win an Asian Cup

When the Wanderers began organising travel packages a month ago, there were initial concerns that female supporters may be segregated in a separate part of the ground.

But it is understood Ms Durnell will be allowed to sit with her father and the 12 other Western Sydney supporters.

Women have only recently been permitted to attend football matches after Saudi Arabia changed its laws last year.

A woman wearing the niquab caused uproar in Saudi Arabia earlier the month after she was televised cheering on Al-Hilal in the United Arab Emirates.

The 14 Wanderers fans in Saudi Arabia will no doubt be swallowed in the crowd as they watch their team attempt to press home their 1-0 advantage

'I hope we're loud and I hope they can hear us,' Ms Durnell told the newspaper. 

Veteran goalkeeper Ante Covic said at Monday's open training session the supporters were part of the side's success.  

'They're a big part of this club right now,' he said. 

'When you come to a club like this and you look out at the stands ... it lifts us on the field.'
