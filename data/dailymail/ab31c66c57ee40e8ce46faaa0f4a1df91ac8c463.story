A British student’s field trip has spawned the discovery of a new frog.

Samuel Penny, who is doing a Master’s at Bristol University, was studying the amphibians on the island of Madagascar, off East Africa, when he made the finding.

The tree frog is green with red speckles on its head and back. Adults are between two and three centimetres long, and a total of 56  were found.

The finding was unveiled in a report by Mr Penny and Kent University scientists in the journal Zoo Keys.

Mr Penny said: 'This brightly coloured tree frog has a distinctive advertisement call so by placing sound recorders at potential breeding sites, I could plot its distribution across a wide area of the Sahamalaza Peninsula.

'This also provided detailed information on acoustic variation between individuals and on how its calling pattern changed throughout the night.'

The new species has been named Boophis ankarafensis as it was found on the banks of the hidden streams of the Ankarafa Forest.

The males were found calling from vegetation around 0.5 to 2m high. They were often within close proximity to each another and positioned on different leaves of the same plant.

The new species is described in a paper published in the journal Zoo Keys, co-authored by Mr Penny and an international team of scientists, headed by Dr Goncalo Rosa of Kent University’s Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology.

Dr Rosa said: 'Despite its conspicuous call - a triple click, compared to the usual double, Boophis ankarafensis has not been detected from other surveys of north west Madagascar and it is likely to be a local endemic to the peninsula.

'Although occurring inside a National Park, this species is highly threatened by the continuing decline in the quality and extent of its habitat.

'Due to these threats it is proposed that this beautiful new species should be classified as critically endangered according to the IUCN Red List criteria.'
