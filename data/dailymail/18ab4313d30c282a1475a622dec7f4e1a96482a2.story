From bizarre fringed angel wings to rainbow striped block frocks, the designs that appear on the world's catwalks can appear odd to say the least.

But now a new book argues that these ostensibly unwearable examples of 'subversive fashion' have paved the way for a wardrobe revolution - and have allowed unusual subcultures to flourish.

According to fashion expert Marnie Fogg, designers such as Thierry Mugler, Jean Paul Gaultier and Walter Van Beirendonck have redefined what is acceptable.

As a result, the catwalk is no stranger to subversive fashion, with plank hats, lollipop coats and transparent gowns all seen in recent years, but, says Fogg, these looks are moving to the High Street too.

Peplums, oversized shoulders and, most recently, trainers with everything are all beneficiaries of their work and are proof that challenging catwalk looks can translate to the closet.

'Many original designs elicit the response: "You can’t go out dressed like that!",' she writes in her latest book. 'But modern fashion is not as outrageous and unwearable as it may seem.'

In Why You Can Go Out Dressed Like That, she also looks at some of the more unusual subcultures spawned by quirky fashion, among them Japan's cutesy Kawaii girls.

'All too often a lack of obvious fit or 
purpose has been mistaken for a lack of design sophistication,' she continues.

'Why You 
Can Go Out Dressed Like That explores the ways in which designers have 
confronted the idea of "fit" and its relation to the form of the body.'

The result has been cutting-edge garments that seem revolutionary at the time but eventually become part of wardrobes everywhere.

Among them are staples such as the simple jumper, the Breton top and the twinset, all of which appeared outrageous when first introduced but soon became modern classics.

More recent examples to feature in Fogg's work include the cerebral designs developed by Comme des Garçons, Thom Browne's broad-shouldered men and the glamorous augmented anatomies of Thierry Mugler.

Why You Can Go Out Dressed Like That by Marnie Fogg is published by Thames and Hudson and costs £9.99
