Eating a Mediterranean diet is good for the mind as well as the body and improves a person's quality of life, according to researchers.

The study found that the consumption of oil-rich Mediterranean foods, such as fish and seafood, helps to improve overall well-being.

For years the region's diet has been associated with superior physical health.

But scientists have now linked its consumption to improved mental and physical health too.

A Mediterranean diet, which is characterised by a regular intake of fruit, vegetables, pulses, fish, olive oil and nuts, has been proven to lessen the chances of chronic illness.

Regions where people subside on it also have a lower mortality rate.

However, it was not yet clear how the 
diet impacts on mental and physical health and quality of life.

So scientists devised a food 
pyramid, which states main meals should never lack cereals and fruit and
 veg - and a daily intake of two litres of water.

Olive oil is the main source of fat 
for nutritional quality and moderate consumption of wine is recommended,
 as well as fish, lean meat and eggs - all are found in Mediterranean 
diets.

At the top of the pyramid are sugar, 
sweets, cakes, pastries and sweet drinks, which should only be consumed 
occasionally and in small amounts.

The researchers, from the University of Las
 Palmas de Gran Canaria and the University of Navarra in Spai, conducted a four-year study of the eating habits of more than 11,000 university 
students.

Dietary intake data was taken at the 
beginning of the study and self-perceived quality of life was measured 
after the four year period.

To determine whether the Mediterranean
 diet was followed, consumption of vegetables, pulses, fruit, nuts, 
cereals and fish were positively rated on a questionnaire and meat, 
dairy products and alcohol were negatively valued.

Results showed those who stuck more to
 the Mediterranean diet scored higher on the quality of life 
questionnaire in terms of physical and mental well-being, with the link 
to physical well-being even stronger.

Lead researcher Patricia Henrmquez Sanchez said: 'The progressive ageing of the population in developed countries makes it even more interesting to find out those factors that can increase quality of life and the health of the population.

'The Mediterranean diet is an important factor associated with better quality of life and can be considered as a healthy food model.'

The study is published in the European Journal of
 Clinical Nutrition.
