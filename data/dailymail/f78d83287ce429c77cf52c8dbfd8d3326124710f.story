An 18th century cook book filled with bizarre meals enjoyed by King George II, including blackbirds and puffins, has emerged for sale.

The recipes include items Heston Blumenthal would think twice about experimenting with today but 300 years ago it was deemed fit for a king.

The book is made up of lists of day-to-day meals served to the German-born monarch and his guests at Kensington Palace between 1736 to 1737.

Fascinating: The Kensington Palace cook book (right) is effectively a list of the daily meals served for King George II (left), his wife Queen Caroline, and their guests. The date appears on top of each page

Fit for a king? Puffins are among the many unusual creatures that found themselves on George II's dinner plate

Roasted sea birds and garden birds were frequently devoured by George and his wife, Queen Caroline, including larkes, snipes, teals, godwits, puffins, pigeons and blackbirds.

The royal couple also scoffed tiny ortolans, a small migratory bird that was drowned in Armagnac, plucked, roasted and then eaten whole on a spoon.

Quail and rooster were also on the menu at Kensington Palace along with frogs, lamb and boar heads, mutton and roasted pig.

The meals were created by master cook William Daniell who noted them in a 77 page book that took 18 months to compile.

It was later given to Daniel Durant, the clerk of the kitchen at Kensington Palace.

It has now been made available for sale at Dominic Winter auctions in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, with a pre-sale estimate of Â£8,000.

There are several grease spots on the book from where it was close proximity to boiling fatty food

Chris Albury, a spokesman for the auction house, said: 'This manuscript gives us a magnificent insight into dining at the royal household in the early 18th century.

'Some of the food eaten back them isn't for the squeamish... It seemed that any bird that could fly and be shot at was fair game for the dinner table.

'Our tastes have changed over time and you would never consider eating a garden bird now.'

A lot of the food in the cook book is incredibly rich, with vast quantities of roasted meat requiring plenty of exercise to burn it all off.

The book is effectively a list of the daily meals served for the King, Queen and their guests, with each day's date on top of each page.

Mr Albury said: 'The manuscript opens with dinner for Her Majesty Queen Caroline alone at Kensington on June 1, 1736 and continues until December 1, 1737... There are some missing periods which include Queen Caroline's illness and death in November 1737.'

He added: 'But her demise didn't put the Royal family off enjoying their Christmas dinner a month later... His Majesty was served bisk squabs, chicks friccasy, capon grill, cold turkey, shoulder ofmutton, plumb broth, minced pies.

'And for supper there was supper mutton and chicks cold, veal fille broiled, oysters in lemons, spinnage and eggs, stewed lettuce, herring salad, jelly pippins and peepers which I believe are frogs,' he said.

Mr Albury went on to say: 'There is also a dinner menu for the commemoration of Coronation Day, 11 October 1737... This gastronomic feast included quails, ortolans, teal, snipe, larkes, English morels and roatsed capons and pig."

The book was written in sepia ink in informal handwriting with calligraphic flourishes.

There are several grease spots on some of the pages from where the book was in close proximity of boiling fatty food taken out of the ovens.

William Daniell died in 1739 aged 75 and is buried in the gardens at Chelsea Hospital.

The book is being sold on January 29.
