The family of American aid worker Kayla Jean Mueller who has reportedly been killed in a Jordanian air strike said she spent her life helping those in need and was devoted to the people of Syria. 

ISIS militants have released a statement claiming Miss Mueller, 26, died in an attack outside the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa in Syria.

Miss Mueller, who was taken hostage in August 2013 as she left a Doctors Without Borders hospital in the Syrian city of Aleppo, is understood to be the last U.S. hostage held by the terror group, which has been demanding $6.6 million for her release.

Her death has not yet been verified by independent sources and could easily be a propaganda move by the terror group to lay blame for the woman's death at the door of Jordan.

Victim: Kayla Jean Mueller is believed to have been captured by ISIS scouts in Aleppo in August 2013 along with a number of Syrian aid workers, including her boyfriend

In a statement to NPR radio station in the U.S., Miss Mueller's family described her as someone who was recognised for her academic abilities and her commitment to philanthropy.

It read: 'Kayla has spent her adult life traveling the world and helping those in need. 

'After graduating from college, she spent more than one year living and working with humanitarian aid groups in northern India, Israel and Palestine. 

'She returned home to Arizona in 2011, and worked for one year at an HIV/AIDS clinic while volunteering at a women's shelter at night. 

'In December 2011, she traveled to France to be an au pair so she could learn French in preparation for work in Africa.

'War sidetracked Kayla's Africa plans as she was drawn to alleviate the suffering of Syrian refugees.'

According to her family, Miss Mueller moved to the Turkish/Syrian border in December 2012 and began working with Support to Life and the Danish Refugee Council to help people who had been forced to flee their homes.

'Kayla found this work heartbreaking but compelling; she was extremely devoted to the people of Syria,' her family added.

'The common thread of Kayla's life has been her quiet leadership and strong desire to serve others.'  

Miss Mueller is from Prescott, Arizona - a small town in the mid-west where her father runs a car repair garage - and graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009.

Her parents, both in their early 60s, have a large detached home on the side of a hill in a rural area of the state.

Miss Mueller takes part in a march in Arizona in 2007, promoting aid to the Darfur region of Sudan. She was a High school senior when this picture was taken

Shocking: American officials said they were looking into the reports of Kayla Jean Mueller's death. The White House said it did not have immediate comment

The university graduate was a determined activist as a young woman who volunteered for three years with a coalition battling genocide in war torn African nations.

The young humanitarian conducted two silent walks in her hometown to raise awareness surrounding the issue.

She also wrote letters and placed calls to members of Congress to push for a change in US policy.

Her efforts landed her with several youth awards and she went on to dedicate her life to humanitarian aid.  

Shortly after arriving in Aleppo, Miss Mueller and her Syrian boyfriend were believed to have been kidnapped by Islamic State militants and taken to Raqqa.

She had been working in Turkey assisting Syrian refugees, according to a 2013 article in her local newspaper. She told the paper that she was drawn to help with the situation in Syria.

‘For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,’ she said.

‘It’s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.’
