England pair Jack Wilshere and Phil Jagielka celebrated their comfortable 5-0 victory over San Marino with a Twitter selfie... but rudely didn't invite team-mate Nathaniel Clyne to join in the fun!

The Arsenal midfielder posted the happy snap of himself and the Everton defender on Twitter, with the caption: 'Me with the GoalScorer @pjags06 #Toffee', but left poor Clyne to look on forlornly in the background.

Jagielka scored the opening goal of the night at Wembley on his first return to England's starting lineup since they lost 2-1 to Uruguay at the World Cup.

Clyne, meanwhile, is with the senior squad for the first time, but remained on the bench all night as his former Southampton team-mate Calum Chambers played the full 90 minutes at right-back.

Also caught in the picture is Kieran Gibbs, who made his first competitive appearance for England on Thursday night. 

After Jagielka's opener, Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Andros Townsend added goals before an own-goal late on made it five.  

Next up for the Three Lions is a trip to Tallinn to face Estonia on Sunday evening, a game that the Everton captain and Wilshere will both likely be involved in.
