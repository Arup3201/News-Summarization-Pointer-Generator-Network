Regent Seven Seas has just unveiled plans for the largest cruise ship suite in the world.

The Regent Suite, which sleeps two, will be found on the Seven Seas Explorer vessel once it launches next year.

Not only is this on-board suite the largest - equalling the size of a townhouse at a whopping 3,875 sq feet - it's also the most pricey.

Regent Seven Seas Cruises have just unveiled plans for the largest cruise ship suite in the world: the Regent Suite

The Regent Seven Seas Explorer is set to hit the seas in 2016, though advanced booking will begin in early 2015

The Seven Seas Explorer's journey will take guests from Monte Carlo to Venice over 14 nights - and to check into The Regent Suite, passengers are looking at a cost of £42,799 ($65,178) per person. 

In case you were interested, that's just over £3,057 ($4,655) per person per night.

The hefty price-tag also includes all food and drink, excursions (complete with private transport), and in-room spa treatments in the 'relaxation chamber'.

The suite's living area boasts 270-degree views over the ship's bow, as well as a well-appointed dining room, bar area, and grand piano

The Explorer will take 750 guests from Monte Carlo to Venice - and to stay in The Regent Suite for the 14-night trip, it will cost you!

The suite also features a private garden, sauna and steam room, and 270-degree views.

Not ready to splash out over £3000 per night? 

The ship's Deluxe Suite or 'sapphire jewel-inspired' Penthouse Suite are similarly luxurious options - at just a fraction of the cost.

For those who prefer not to splash out on a £3057 per night room, the 'sapphire jewel-inspired' Penthouse Suite is another option

The Explorer's Deluxe Suite is another stately option, coming in at a much lower cost than its Penthouse and Regent Suite counterparts

The Seven Seas Explorer, which will weigh 56,000 gross tonnes and carry 750 guests, aims to be 'recognised industry-wide as the most luxurious ship ever.'

Construction began on the ship on July 15 in Genoa, Italy. 

The Explorer will join the rest of the award-winning Regent Seven Seas Cruises fleet in the summer of 2016.

Regent Seven Seas Cruises will begin taking reservations for its maiden voyage and inaugural season in early 2015.
