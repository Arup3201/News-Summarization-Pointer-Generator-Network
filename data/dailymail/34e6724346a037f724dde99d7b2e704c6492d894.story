Two young Amish sisters were sexually abused after their abduction from a roadside farm stand in northern New York, a prosecutor said Saturday.

St. Lawrence County District Attorney Mary Rain's disclosure came hours after the county's sheriff said the couple charged in the kidnapping were prowling for easy targets and may have planned to abduct other children.

Stephen Howells Jr. and Nicole Vaisey, both of Hermon, were arrested and arraigned Friday on charges they abducted the 7-year-old and 12-year-old sisters with the intent to physically or sexually abuse them.

'We
 felt that there was the definite potential that there was going to be 
other victims,' St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells said.

The
 sisters were abducted Wednesday from the farm stand in front of the 
family's home in Oswegatchie, near the Canadian border. They were set 
free by their captors about 24 hours later and turned up safe at the 
door of a house 15 miles from where they were taken.

The
 sheriff said Howells, 39, and Vaisey, 25, 'were targeting 
opportunities' and did not necessarily grab the girls because they were 
Amish.

'There was a lot of thought process that went into this,' Wells said. 'They were looking for opportunities to victimize.'

The suspects are being held without bail. A preliminary court appearance is scheduled for Thursday.

Vaisey's
 lawyer, Bradford Riendeau told The New York Times that Howells had 
abused Vaisey and treated her submissively. He said she made a 'voluntary statement' to investigators after her arrest and was 
obtaining an order of protection against him.

'She appears to have been the slave and he was the master,' Riendeau told the newspaper.

There was no answer Saturday at the St. Lawrence County Conflict Defender's Office, which is representing Howells.

Wells said the girls were able to provide details to investigators about their time in captivity.

The
 kidnappings touched off a massive search in the family's remote farming
 community. Searchers scoured the community of about 4,000 people, but 
were hampered by a lack of photos of the girls.

The
 Amish typically avoid modern technology, and the family had to work 
with an artist who spoke their language, a German dialect known as 
Pennsylvania Dutch, to produce a sketch of the older girl.

Meanwhile little is known about the accused.

A neighbor described them as boyfriend and girlfriend to 7News and said three other children lived in the house.

On his Facebook page, Howells appears to be a father to three children. It's uncertain whether his girlfriend, Vaisey, is the mother.

Two cars were parked on the property, one red and one white, which appear to match descriptions of the vehicles used in the kidnapping.

The couple could face 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

The girls 'seem to be healthy' after being reunited with family, officials say.

The episode left a sense of vulnerability in a community where residents said even small children often walk unaccompanied to school.

'One thing that comes from this is that people learn this can happen in a small town,' Rain said. "I think the public will take precautions, and that's the sad thing.'

Patricia Ritchie, the state senator representing the region, said many are now reluctant to let their children play outdoors unattended.

Ritchie said the Amish are responding in a way that may forever change a familiar feature of the local landscape: Some are taking down their roadside stands.

'This has sent a shockwave through their community,' she said.

If convicted in the kidnapping, the couple could spend 25 years to life in prison
