The United States has no plans to send troops back into Iraq despite the bloody resurgence of an al-Qaeda faction that has captured major cities, seized hundreds of millions of dollars and forced more than a half-million people to flee their homes this week.

America has 35,000 troops station around the Middle East, a Pentagon official confirmed on Wednesday, including 10,000 in nearby Kuwait.

A State Department official told MailOnline on background that there are no plans to use them.

The Sunni-led group called the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) – also known as the Islamic State of Iraq in Syria (ISIS) –  was formerly known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

On Tuesday the White House touted its past support of the Iraqi government with copious amounts of military hardware, but hinted that a return of armed personnel would be out of the question.

U.S.Special Forces participated in the 'Eager Lion' joint military exercises in the Gulf of Aqaba on June 5, along with Kuwait, Jordan and France; the US has 2,000 troops stations there, along with a contingent of F-16 fighter jets, and left a Patriot missile battery behind after the war games concluded

Warlord Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has seized control of the Iraqi provincial capital of Tikrit just a day of gaining power in the country's second biggest city Mosul. ISIS militants gathered in this photo in Iraq's Nineveh province

Iraqi soldiers were no match for the group formerly known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq as Jihadists seized all of Mosul and Nineveh province and also took areas in Kirkuk province, to its east, and Salaheddin to the south

'Our shipments, in terms of assistance to Iraq, have included the delivery of 300 Hellfire missiles, millions of rounds of small arms fire, thousands of rounds of tank ammunition, helicopter-fired rockets, machine guns, grenades, flares, sniper rifles, M16s and M4 rifles to the Iraqi security forces,' Deputy White House Press Secretary Joshua Earnest eagerly cataloged.

And a Pentagon source told MailOnline that the U.S. expected to speed up a planned transfer of Apache helicopters – a sale that was put on the back burner after Iraq made a large purchase of guns and ammunition from neighboring Iran.

America's support of Nouri al-Maliki's Shia Muslim-led government, Earnest said Tuesday, has been 'rapid, comprehensive, and is continuing.'

But Maliki, he said, must 'step up to the plate' and 'better meet the needs of the Iraqi people,' rather than counting on America to ride to the rescue.

Separately, Earnest praised former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for 'ending the war in Iraq, responsibly winding down the war in Afghanistan, and decimating and destroying core al-Qaeda.'

Clinton is a likely Democratic front-runner for the presidency in 2016.

Aboard Air Force One en route to Massachusetts on Wednesday, Earnest stayed away from any suggestion that President Obama and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel might intervene with boots on the ground.

'The United States is deeply concerned about the continued aggression of ISIL in Iraq,' he said, referring to the deterioration of security there as a humanitarian issue.

'The situation in Iraq is grave,' Earnest said, according to a White House pool reporter. There is no doubt that the situation has deteriorated over the last 24 hours.'

Earnest, the pool reporter wrote, 'said Washington was continuing to work with the Iraqi government to see how it could help.'

The United States has considerable forces at its disposal that could be sent into Iraq, or maneuvered to patrol its waters, if Obama should decide to intervene.

A Pentagon official told MailOnline that the U.S. maintains a fighting force of approximately 10,000 troops in Kuwait and 2,000 in Jordan.

The units in Jordan include a detachment of F-16 fighter jets and a Patriot missile battery that remained behind after the 2013 joint 'Eager Lion' drills with the Jordanian military.

The U.S. also maintains a Combined Air Operations Center in Qatar, and the Navy's 5th fleet in Bahrain.

Asked for a comprehensive list of forces in the area, 
U.S. Central Command spokesman Commander Bill Speaks told MailOnline: 
'That's kind of a loaded question. Certainly we have a significant 
military presence there.'

'Of course, we will not provide details of military assets,' Cmdr. Speaks said in a followup email, 'but there are roughly 35,000 total US forces in the Middle East region.'

The U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet is based in the island nation of Bahrain, just 300 miles from Iraq's shores on the Persian Gulf

America has an estimated 35,000 troops in the Middle East, many of whom could quickly reach Iraq if the White House should decide to intervene against ISIS

EXODUS: As many as 500,000 Iraqis have been forced to flee the country's second biggest city of Mosul after militants from an al-Qaeda splinter group seized control

The State Department said Tuesday that the U.S. 'supports a strong, coordinated response to push back against this aggression in Mosul,' Iraq's oil-rich and second largest city, which is now in ISIS hands.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of the so called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, is a warlord considered more dangerous than the late Osama bin Laden

But it made no suggestion that American troops should be part of that response.

On Wednesday, ISIS and its terrorist warlord Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi took control of Tikrit, another Iraqi city. Maliki has asked his parliament to declare martial law throughout the country.

But the U.S. government, like Britain's, has signaled that moral support and armaments will be the limit of its help.

The U.S. pulled its last ground troops out of Iraq in December 2011, following nearly nine years of costly and controversial deployments involving 1.5 million troops.

More than 30,000 Americans were wounded in the conflict, and nearly 4,500 were killed.

The Obama administration took a victory lap at the time of the final pullout, with the president declaring in a speech at Fort Bragg, N.C. that from that day forward 'Iraqis future will be in the hands of its people. America's war in Iraq will be over.'

'It's harder to end a war than begin one,' Obama said, presaging the slogan that has marked his military withdrawal from Afghanistan.

'Indeed, everything that American troops have done in Iraq – all the fighting and all the dying, the bleeding and the building, and the training and the partnering – all of it has led to this moment of success.'

ISIS now controls Mosul, Tikrit and parts of Syria

He also claimed then that U.S. forces had 'broken the momentum of the Taliban' in Afghanistan, and had 'gone after al-Qaeda so that terrorists who threaten America will have no safe haven and Osama bin Laden will never again walk the face of this Earth.'

But according to a senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke with The Washington Post, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the ISIS leader who also goes by the moniker 'Abu Dua,' is 'more violent, more virulent, [and] more anti-American' than bin Laden.

He claims to be a direct descendant of the Muslim prophet Muhammad.

The U.S. currently has a $10 million bounty on his head.

Republican Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte said Tuesday that a 'growing threat to our national security interests is the cost of President Obama’s decision to withdraw all of our troops from Iraq in 2011, against the advice of our commanders and regardless of conditions on the ground.'

'Unfortunately,' they said in a statement, the president is now making the same disastrous mistake in Afghanistan, increasing the risk that al-Qaeda and its terrorist allies will return there just as they are in Iraq.'
