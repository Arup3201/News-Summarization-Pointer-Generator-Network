Tony Blair was warned by MI6 that his feud with Gordon Brown was becoming so problematic that France and Germany were plotting to exploit their differences, it has been claimed.

The latest volumes of Alastair Campbell’s diaries reveal that intelligence memos were passed to Blair informing him that Germany believed he and Brown 'were on different tracks' and that they, as well as the French, planned to take advantage of this.

At an EU summit in Nice in December 2000, Campbell noted: 'The French and Germans, according to the spooks, were exploiting the fact that GB was seen as a rival to TB, to try to divide them further.'

According to new revelations, the rivalry between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, left, was thought to be a risk to British interests on the world stage

In an earlier diary entry, on October 12, Campbell wrote: 'TB showed me a piece of intelligence which showed that the Germans assessed our problems on Europe ... [as] a sense that TB and GB were on a different track to each other.'

Meanwhile, Campbell’s diaries also reveal that Mr Blair 
repeatedly told him that Ed Balls, now shadow Chancellor and then Mr 
Brown’s senior adviser, was a ‘highly disruptive influence’.

Last month, private papers showed Balls had been part of a ‘brutal’ plot to topple Mr Blair just days after the 7/7 attacks.

The Prime Minister told Mr Campbell, his chief spin doctor, that Mr Balls kept talking to him as if he were a mere junior official.

Mr Campbell wrote, on 25 April 2001: ‘TB… said he had just about had enough of Ed Balls talking to him like something on his shoe.’

The diaries, published in the Guardian, also revealed that Mr Balls breached Treasury rules by leaking details of the government’s response to the fuel duty protests – that fuel duty would be frozen for two years – before Brown’s pre-budget report in November 2000.

Mr Campbell wrote: ‘It was wrong to leak tax measures… it was misleading.’

Mr Balls continues to deny he was involved in any plots to oust Mr Blair.

The
diaries also reveal that MI6 handed Tony Blair a private intelligence 
assessment which showed that the French and German governments had drawn
up plans to exploit his divisions with Gordon Brown, according to 
Alastair Campbell.

The pair rowed about the euro, with Mr Brown telling the PM in 1999: ‘Do you want to be responsible for mass unemployment?’

Relations got so bad in 2000, Mr Blair was forced to ask Lord (Richard) Attenborough, the actor and director, to mediate between them.

As early as 2001, Mr Brown put pressure on him to set a date for his departure, and in April of that year he told Mr Blair he was ‘crap’ and that he should stand down to allow for the restoration of cabinet government.

Just two months before the 2001 election Mr Brown accused Mr Blair of having ‘betrayed’ him when he stood for the Labour leadership in 1994 and of having taken ‘that job away from me’.

On the day before the 2001 general election Mr Blair told his inner circle he had ‘sadly, very sadly’ reached the conclusion that Brown was working against him. But he said it was impossible to sack him or move him from his position as chancellor.]

The diaries also reveal Mr Blair turned ‘white with fury’ – and later rebuked Brown in private – when his chancellor responded with ‘venom and contempt’ to his question at a presentation by Treasury officials.

On 9/11 Mr Blair excluded his Chancellor from a smaller ministerial meeting in Downing Street, following the main Cobra crisis meeting, because his answers had become ‘monosyllabic’ in recent discussions.
