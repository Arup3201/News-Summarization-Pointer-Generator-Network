The 30th Summer Olympic Games officially opened this afternoon and there was a perfect start for Team GB as the women's football team beat New Zealand 1-0.

But organsiers were forced to make a grovelling apology to the North Korean team who refused to start theIR match against Colombia when the South Korean flag was displayed by mistake.

In the British match a free-kick from Steph Houghton after 65 minutes split the sides at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, though the ground was only half-full for Britain's historic debut in the competition.

Talking about the mix-up with the 
North Korean flag organisers said: 'Today ahead of the women's football 
match at Hampden Park, the South Korean flag was shown on a big screen 
video package instead of the North Korean flag.

'Clearly that is a mistake. We will 
apologize to the team and the National Olympic Committee and steps will 
be taken to ensure this does not happen again.'

The match against Colombia was delayed more than an hour and was scheduled to start shortly.

Despite all the organisers' claims that 
the Olympics would sell-out, Team GB kicked off the London Games in 
front of swathes of empty seats.

But
those in attendance saw a winning start, as Houghton's perfect 25-yard 
free-kick proved the difference in a tightly-fought match.

Officially, an estimated 
40,000 tickets had been sold - which would be a record for a women's 
football international in Britain - but there were huge swathes of empty
seats when the match began as fans drifted into the stadium.

Those that did arrive early wouldn't have been too inspired by a goalless first-half, but Great Britain gained the upper hand after half-time.

As
of yesterday, 36,200 tickets had been sold in advance - barely enough 
to fill two tiers of the 74,000-capacity stadium - with a few thousand 
expected to pick up £20 seats on the gate to watch Hope Powell's team.

The unfilled seats would have come as a disappointment for Games organiser Lord Coe, who 
was in Cardiff to officially declare the Olympics open.

He said: 'We are ready, the nation is ready - let the Games begin.

'It has been a long journey but I’m convinced these games will lift the nation and bring the country together.

'We’ve
proved the doubters wrong by getting everything ready on time and we’re
looking forward to making these Olympics a huge success.

'When I arrived in Cardiff I felt I had arrived in an Olympic city - this is the start of the Games in a fantastic setting.

'We haven’t left any stone unturned in giving the athletes the platform on which to perform.'

Millennium Stadium general manager Gerry Toms stressed the historic nature of the occasion as a Team GB women's football team played in the Olympics for the first time.

He said: 'There was some criticism that ticket sales were slow.

'But a normal women’s football game would attract about 6,000-8,000 and we are close to 40,000.

'Clearly there is an interest in the football and the Olympics. People who are not normally football fans want to be able to say that they were there.'

Meanwhile, 41,000 will be at Hampden Park in Glasgow this evening for a women's football double-header of the United States v France and North Korea v Columbia.

While this will fill most of the 52,000-seater Scottish national stadium, only 6,500 of the tickets have actually been sold.

The remainder have been given away to charities, youth groups and sports clubs.

Organisers said overall 80,000 free tickets had been distributed for Hampden's eight Olympic matches.

Two other games will be played today at the City of Coventry Stadium, which holds 32,500.

The Millennium stadium had been cleaned and freshly painted for the occasion, the familiar red of the Welsh national rugby and football teams replaced by purple Olympic paraphernalia.

Cardiff likes to shout about its sporting pedigree, and rightly so. Team GB boast a record number of Welsh athletes — 30 (which beats the 27 who appeared in 1908) — including two captains: Manchester United midfielder Ryan Giggs and 400 metres hurdles world champion Dai Greene.

A giant set of Olympic rings, measuring 18m x 8m (59ft x 26ft), has been outside the City Hall since late April. Huge crowds cheered the Olympic torch when it visited Cardiff in May.

About £160,000 of taxpayers’ money has been spent on ‘cleansing and animating’ the city centre, which is prettily dressed in bunting to mark the 11 football matches it will hold over the next 16 days.

But this hasn't translated into ticket sales. Tickets will be available on the gate today, starting at £20 with Under 16s paying their age.

The ease of catching a train from London also means the city has seen only a modest rise in hotel bookings.

A recent poll by Cardiff-based 
newspaper The  Western Mail saw 52 per cent of 1,006 respondents agree 
with the statement: ‘I don’t think Wales will see any benefits from the 
London 2012 Olympics.’

It 
was God Save The Queen that was rehearsed at the stadium yesterday, in 
preparation for the arrival of a British team that does not include a 
single Welsh player.

But
the British team are looking forward to their chance to take 
centre-stage in a home Olympic Games. Their match will be broadcast live
on BBC One from 3.30pm this afternoon.

Those
in attendance at the Millennium Stadium will witness history, because 
this is the first time a British women's football team has participated 
in the Olympics.

'It is fantastic to be opening the Games and that we aren't competing with any other sport,' said Team GB captain Casey Stoney.

'This is as big as the World Cup. If opening the Games with the first-ever GB side is pressure, let's make it a good one.

'We are desperate to do well and make sure we leave a lasting legacy for women's football.'

Team GB face a tricky group with Cameroon and Brazil, one of the favourites for gold, to play after New Zealand.
