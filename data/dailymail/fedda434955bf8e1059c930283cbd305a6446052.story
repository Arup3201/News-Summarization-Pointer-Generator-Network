Probe: The Justice Department is investigating alleged misdeeds by DEA workers in Colombia unrelated to the Secret Service scandal

A new investigation may reveal that the Secret Service isn’t the only government agency that has hired prostitutes for Colombian sex romps.

The Justice Department Inspector General's office said Monday it is investigating possible misconduct by three Drug Enforcement Administration workers in Colombia unrelated to the Secret Service incident with prostitutes at a Cartagena hotel that erupted last month.

The agency said the probe began based on info provided by the Secret Service and that the DEA is making its employees available for interviews by the Department of Justice Inspector General's investigators.

CBS News reported that three DEA agents were under investigation for allegedly hiring prostitutes in Cartagena.

In a statement to the network, Justice Department spokesman Jay Lerner said: 'The Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General is investigating allegations about potential misconduct by Drug Enforcement Administration personnel in Colombia, unrelated to the Cartagena hotel Secret Service incident.'

The IG said it is receiving full cooperation from the DEA and that the IG is coordinating the investigation with the Homeland Security Department's inspector general, the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service and the Secret Service.

The DEA, which enforces U.S. controlled-substance laws, has permanent offices in Colombia.

The Bogota-based DEA regional director, who oversees the Cartagena office, did not immediately return email or cellphone messages.

A statement to CBS from the DEA said: "DEA takes allegations of misconduct very seriously and will take appropriate personnel action, if warranted, upon the conclusion of the OIG investigation."

In the Secret Service probe, investigators have interviewed the Colombia prostitute at the center of the affair, Dania Londono Suarez.

She said a dispute over payment led to the April 12 incident becoming public.

One man, identified as Arthur Huntington, allegedly agreed on a price of $800 to have sex with Miss Suarez, she said in a recent interview.

She explained that during the transaction she gestured the amount with hand signals and using the words 'sex', 'sexo', 'cash', dinero' to get the point across.

She said the pair had 'normal' sex and then the agent fell asleep, giving her ample opportunity to steal whatever she wanted from his hotel room - which she did not do.

The 24-year-old said the next morning, although the man wanted her to stay, she asked for the money they had agreed upon the previous evening - which was when he became 'very angry'. 

The agent then gave her $50 and closed the door. Police became involved, setting off a Secret Service investigation

A dozen Secret Service officers and supervisors and 12 other U.S. military personnel have been implicated in the incident, which took place before President Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas.

Eight people with the Secret Service, including two supervisors, have been axed from their posts as a result of their involvement.

The Secret Service is moving to permanently revoke the security clearance for one other employee, and three others have been cleared of serious wrongdoing.

Prostitution is legal in Colombia.
