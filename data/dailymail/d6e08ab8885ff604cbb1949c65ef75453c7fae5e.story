David Cameron today demanded assurances from China over the investigation into the death of Neil Heywood as pictures emerged of the hotel where the British businessman met his murky end.

Mr Heywood, 41, was found dead in mysterious circumstances at the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing last November.

It is one of the city's most secluded areas, but one which has now attracted the unwanted attention of the world as speculation over the ex-Harrovian's demise intensifies.

Suspicious: The reception area of the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing, China, where British businessman Neil Heywood was found dead, apparently poisoned after threatening to expose the corrupt dealings of the wife of Communist Party chief Bo Xilai

Private: The three-star resort, also known as the Lucky Holiday Hotel, is one of the most secluded areas of the city and was well-known to Mr Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, the prime suspect in Mr Heywood's alleged murder

Questions remain: It is thought that Mr Heywood was killed in one of the mountain-top hotel's £600-a-night villas, but details of his demise are sketchy

Today, the British Prime Minister told China's propaganda chief that the investigation must observe due process and address concerns raised about his suspicious death.

Mr Cameron was meeting Politburo member Li Changchun at No 10 to discuss efforts to deepen the UK’s trade and cultural relationship with China, as well as bilateral co-operation on global issues like Iran and Syria.

But the PM was also planning to raise the death of Mr Heywood.

Mr Heywood was a friend of the family of Bo Xilai, a former rising star in Chinese politics who served as local party chief in Chongqing, but was suspended from the Politburo in April amid allegations of 'serious discipline violations'.

Keeping up the pressure: David Cameron meets China's propaganda chief Li Changchun at Downing Street today where he sought reassurances that the probe into Mr Heywood's death would follow due process

State media reports in China have 
suggested that investigations by authorities there indicate Mr Heywood 
was a victim of homicide.

Unconfirmed
media reports suggest that police suspect he may have been poisoned 
after threatening to expose a plan by Bo’s wife Gu Kailai to move money 
abroad.

Speaking ahead of 
today’s meeting, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: 'The Prime Minister 
will take the opportunity to raise the case of Neil Heywood, welcoming 
the launch of the Chinese investigation and emphasising that we are keen
to address concerns about the suspicious circumstances of his tragic 
death.

Mystery deepens: It is also alleged that ex-Harrovian Mr Heywood (above) had an affair with Mrs Kailai

'We want to see the conclusion of an investigation that observes due process.'

The three-star resort, also known as the Lucky Holiday Hotel, lies eight miles outside the metropolis atop a forest-covered mountain.

The hotel has a six-floor main building, ten villas in three rows and crucially several CCTV cameras which would have captured Mr Heywood's final moments.

According to the first Chinese report of his death, Mr Heywood was found in one of the hotel's 'apartments' or villas, which cost up to £600 a night.

Chinese police blamed his death on excess alcohol and his body was promptly cremated without a post-mortem examination.

But reports yesterday claimed the father-of-two was poisoned because he was threatening to expose a web of money and corruption surrounding Mrs Kailai.

It was the first time a specific motive has been revealed for his murder, a death which ended Chinese leader Bo Xilai's hopes of emerging as a possible head of the Communist Party.

Mrs Kailai, knew the hotel well and hosted at least one dinner party there, it was reported in the Daily Telegraph.

She has been named as a prime suspect over claims she arranged for Mr Heywood to be poisoned with potassium cyanide.

Mr Bo, 62, has not been named as a suspect in the case, but is under virtual house arrest while he faces a Communist Party investigation.

Foreign Secretary William Hague also said today that Britain wants to see 'the conclusion of a full investigation that observes due process, is free from political interference, exposes the truth behind this tragic case, and ensures that justice is done'.

He told MPs that the Chinese investigation into Mr Heywood’s death was launched after repeated requests from the UK.

In a written statement to the Commons, Mr Hague said Chinese officials initially informed the British consulate-general in Chongqing that Mr Heywood’s death on November 15 last year was due to 'over-consumption of alcohol'.

But he said the Foreign Office was made aware on January 18 of rumours within the British expatriate community calling into question the Chinese police findings.

A British official was present at the cremation and friends and  colleagues of Mr Heywood have questioned why UK diplomats seemingly allowed it to go ahead without pushing for crucial forensic checks first.

Mr Heywood, who had known the Bo family for more than a decade, was said to have confided in a friend about the alleged affair with Mrs Gu, saying it had ‘left his life under threat’. Mr Bo was Communist Party leader in Chongqing at the time.

Internet reports claimed Mrs Gu, who was godmother to the Heywoods’ two young children, met Mr Heywood’s widow Wang Lulu in a cafe two days after his death, accompanied by two armed policemen.

The politician’s wife was said to have begged Mrs Heywood to agree to a swift cremation without a post-mortem examination.
