Philippe Reines, was so enraged hearing about Antony Weiner's latest sexting exploits that he told the New York mayoral candidate he wanted to 'reach through this phone' and 'pull out' his throat

Hillary Clinton's longtime spokesman and adviser, Philippe Reines, was so enraged after hearing about Antony Weiner’s latest sexting exploits that he told the New York mayoral candidate he wanted to ‘reach through this phone’ and ‘pull out’ his throat.

The incident took place on a campaign conference call just hours before Weiner’s infamous news conference on July 23, when his wife Huma Abedin, a close personal friend of Reines, spoke publicly in support of her shamed husband.

According to another participant on the call, Reines used an expletive and proceeded to berate Weiner, reports The New York Times.

Although not a paid member of 
Weiner’s mayoral campaign, Reines – like a number of other longterm 
Clinton aids - has been helping out of loyalty to Abedin.

The
pair have known each other for over 11 years. ‘I’m not sure there’s 
anyone I’ve spoken to or spent more time with over that period,’ Reines 
told the New York Times about their relationship.

Reines
has also been acting as the key communications channel between Abedin 
and Mrs Clinton and it was him to ensured that she knew about Weiner's 
latest escapades before the story broke.

Reines has also been acting as the key communications channel between Abedin and Mrs Clinton and it was him who ensured that she knew about Weiner's latest escapades before the story broke.

Abedin, now 37, is herself a longtime aide to the former secretary of state, having started working in the Clinton White House at the age of 19.

But her ties with Hilliary Clinton have been put under great stress as the Weiner circus has seen the media draw unflattering comparisons with the Clinton's own time in the national spotlight over extra marital affairs back in the 1990s.

Reines’s behind-the-scenes presence illustrates the overlapping roles played by Clinton advisers as they seek to help Abedin navigate her husband’s increasingly toxic campaign, and at the same time protect the Clinton brand from any collateral damage.

Reines have been using their expertise behind the scenes for some time to help Abedin relaunch Weiner’s political career.

In Washington, Reines may be known as Mrs Clinton’s fiercest protector, but last summer he was helping Weiner and Abedin when they spoke to People magazine for a glossy feature that signaled the beginning of Weiner’s attempted comeback

Unfortunately Reines hadn’t factored on Weiner engaging in online liaisons after leaving Congress and those actions have left him exasperated for what else he can do to help.

His role now seems to be more damage limitation and he recently advised Abedin against appearing in her husband’s latest campaign video, which was released on Monday.

In recent days Abedin also has 
stopped campaigning in New York at her husband’s side and has returned 
to Washington where she remains employed by Mrs Clinton.

‘A lot of times, with these things, it’s really just to talk something through with a peer,’ said Reines describing his relationship with Abedin.

He described himself as 'someone who’s not going to pull any punches, or say everything is dandy when it’s not.'

While in Washington, Abedin has also meet with other key Clinton aids and old friends including Cheryl Mills, who was Mrs Clinton’s chief of staff at the State Department.

Clinton is of course weighing up her own political return with a presidential run in 2016 thought to be extremely likely.

People close to the Clintons said they would prefer if Weiner just bowed out of the mayoral race, but they didn't believe his faltering campaign will have any real impact on Mrs Clinton’s political future - beyond some short-term embarrassment.
