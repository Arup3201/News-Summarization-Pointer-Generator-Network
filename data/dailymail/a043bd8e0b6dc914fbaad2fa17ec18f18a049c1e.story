Goalkeeper Petr Cech seems content that he is to remain a Chelsea player at least until January after staying put on transfer deadline day.

Queens Park Rangers had been offered Cech by Chelsea, but the goalkeeper, who has lost his place at Stamford Bridge to Thibaut Courtois, was believed to favour a move to a London club. He will remain at Chelsea in his 11th season at the club.

He Tweeted: 'Blue is the colour ! " ... It hasn't changed... ;-) have a good night everyone.'

Chelsea did not wish to let him join a rival, in either the Premier League or Europe, but were keen to treat their legendary goalkeeper with respect.

Cech would initially give little away when questioned about his future on Monday, however.

'I've been at the club for 10 years, the situation is now new to me,' he told sport.cz. 'The three opening matches I could not play for the team. I have no reason to panic, pack up and leave.

'I am a Chelsea player, where I have two more years of contract.

'In football, nothing can be predicted in advance, nothing is ever perfect.

'A lot of players go on representative duty, yet still many transfer clubs. 

Bright future: QPR have already signed England Under 21 keeper Alex McCarthy from Reading for £6million

Legend: Cech has gone down in history at Stamford Bridge after a glittering career with Chelsea

Appearances: 477

Clean sheets: 220

Trophies:

1x Champions League

1x Europa League

3x Premier League

4x FA Cup

2x League Cup

2x Community shield

'The offer would have to be right for everyone. I do not exclude anything (or) know the answer.'

QPR have already signed Alex McCarthy from Reading for £6million and Robert Green is their first choice.

They recently allowed Brazilian World Cup goalkeeper Julio Cesar to leave for Benfica. 

It is believed that Cech was offered to QPR last week, ahead of them completing the signing of McCarthy from Championship club Reading. 

Paris Saint-Germain could still test Cech's resolve to stay in England in January.

PSG were ruled to have breached the rules last season and have been forced to limit transfer expenditure, meaning a loan deal could be possible.

PSG see Cech as the ideal man to help them win the Champions League, deeming him better than current No 1, Italian Salvatore Sirigu, and would have no problem matching his wages.
