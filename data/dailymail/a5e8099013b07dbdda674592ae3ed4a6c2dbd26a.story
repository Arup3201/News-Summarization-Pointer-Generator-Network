Today show host Lisa Wilkinson has accused Education Minister Christopher Pyne of ‘apologising’ for Indonesian President Joko Widodo about how the Bali Nine duo's journey to their place of execution has been handled.

A fired-up Wilkinson said there had been a ‘full blown and seemingly over the top operation’ as Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were transferred from Kerobokan prison in Bali to the Indonesian ‘death island’ of Nusakambangan on Wednesday.

She also pointed out to Pyne and Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese that Bali’s police chief was ‘all smiles as he took photos with the two men condemned to death’.

‘Elite military vehicles, decoy vehicles, fighter jets, riot squad police - you would have to say right now that president Widodo, rather than listening to the Australian government’s pleas for clemency, he’s treating these men like prize catches, he’s thumbing his nose at us right now isn’t he?,’ Wilkinson asked Pyne.

‘To be fair, the Indonesian justice system and President Widodo is treating the Australian prisoners the same as all the other foreign prisoners in Indonesia,’ Pyne diplomatically replied.

Today Show host Lisa Wilkinson accused the Education Minister of apologising for the way the Bali Nine duo's transfer to their place of execution has been handled

Surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return, 33-year-old Australia Myuran Sukumaran looks up at Bali police commissioner Djoko Hariutomo who posed with the two condemned Australians before their take off from Denpasar airport for the two hour flight to 'death island' 

‘No that’s not true Christopher because one of the other drug smugglers who was also going to face the firing squad left in an unmarked van to go to the same island facing the same death,’ Wilkinson retorted.

Pyne: ‘I think that is much more appropriate but I think to try and characterise President Widodo as thumbing his nose at Australia is something a federal cabinet minister is going to endorse.’

‘But you are apologising for him Christopher, with the greatest respect,’ Wilkinson said.

‘I’m certainly not doing that Lisa I am opposed to the death penalty,’ Pyne reasoned.

The pictures in question emerged on Thursday of a smiling police commissioner posing with the two condemned Australian drug smugglers on the two hour flight to Nusakambangan.

Australia will lodge an official complaint with Indonesia's Ambassador, Nadjib Kesoema, at their outrage and ethical displeasure with these images.

One of the pictures depicts Djoko Hari Utomo, the police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, placing his hand on Chan's shoulder and smiling for the camera. 

Another shows his hand on the shoulder of Sukumaran who was captured gazing up at the officer.  

Although summoned to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ambassador Kesoema is understood to be in Perth and cannot appear in person.

Utter despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner, Myuran Sukumaran, as he arrived at Cilacap airport in central Java, Indonesia, only 700km by plane but a world away from the comparative freedom of his art workshops inside Kerobokan prison on the island of Bali

A senior official, likely to be department secretary Peter Varghese will inform the ambassador of Australia's shock at the images through a telephone call whilst also appealing again for clemency. 

Utomo told Fairfax Media that he was trying to raise the spirits of the Australians by urging them to be tough and brave and had no idea the photo was being taken.

'It was not a selfie moment,' he said. 

Complaints will also be made about the excessive use of force used in transporting the men from Bali's Kerobokan prison to the airport.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said on Thursday that she could not comprehend the enormous display of force by the Indonesian military.

The Australian drug smugglers have plead to Indonesia's President Joko Widodo for clemency, to no avail

'They've never done anything that would suggest they are violent, or that they would risk anybody else's lives,' she said. 

When the images were captured on Wednesday, the Bali Nine duo were being transported on a two hour flight to the port town of Cilacap and transferred to Nusakambangan island where they are expected to face a firing squad in an area known locally as 'Death Valley', a lush green clearing amid citrus orchards and banana palms. 

The spot is called Nirbaya, and it's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of Nusakambangan, which is also known as 'Death Island', and it is the place where just under seven weeks ago the Indonesian Government executed five  drug smugglers.

Last place on earth: This is Nirbaya, also known as 'Death Valley', the place where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will likely be taken for their executions and located up a winding dirt track around 3km from the prison where they are being held in isolation cells

This is the spot to which the Indonesians took five foreign drug smugglers this year, tied them to three metre poles and executed them each with 12-member firing squads at around 12.40am local time  on Sunday, January 18

It is not known how the prisoners destined for execution will be transported to Nirbaya valley, as it lies down a narrow dirt track (above) amid dense vegetation in the middle of Nusakambangan Island off southern central Java

Final journey: The jungle and rainforest of Nuskambangan prison island looms over the Barracuda armoured personnel van carrying Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran as they arrive off the police boat on Wednesday following their final plane flight, from Bali to Cilacap in southern Java

And this place, up a winding dirt track just 3km from where Chan and Sukumaran are being held in isolation cells, is likely to soon be their last place on earth.

Situated quite high up amid hills in the island's centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons.

At the top of the hills surrounding Nirbaya, it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the Indian Ocean to the south.

At around 12.40am on January 18 this year, five drug traffickers were reportedly shot by firing squads in or around this place.

Indonesia executed a total of six drug traffickers on January 18, but Vienamese woman Tran Thi Bich Hanh met her fate on the mainland of central java at a place called Boyolali.

The five executed at Nirbaya on Nuskambangan were Brazilian Marco Archer Moreiea, 53, who smuggled 13kg of coaine in hangliding equipment to Bali in 2004, Dutch national Ang Kiem Soei, who ran an Ecstasy factory, Namaona Denis, 48, Indonesian woman, Rani Andriani, 38, and Nigerian Daniel Enemuo, 38, a Muslim who elected to be buried on the island.

The lead up to execution in 'Death Valley' has been well documented. Under the implementation of death penalty procedures set in Indonesia's criminal act of 1964, the condemned prisoner is informed in their isolation cell at least 72 hours prior to the execution that it will be carried out. 

They are reportedly allowed three 'last requests' but these may only be in the form of final statements, such as that from Ms Andriani who wrote, 'Submission does not mean give up. Do the best, God will finish the rest'.

Port of no return: Sodong port (above) on Nusakambangan Island was the dropping off point on Wednesday for the Australian Bali Nine duo before being taken by road on to the prison where they are currently being held in isolation 

Dressed in simple, white clothing, they are accompanied by a physician, clergy and an 'execution attorney' and taken to the clearing where a firing squad of 12 shooters is assembled  for each prisoner.

In the case of Nirbaya, the journey will be up a steep winding dirt track through trees and undergrowth. At a clearing, three metre high execution poles have been erected at separate spots for each prisoner.

When the prisoners arrive and the firing squad is ready, the condemned person is asked whether they choose to be blindfolded and whether they want to be standing, sitting or kneeling for their execution.

A black cross is marked over their heart and they are given three minutes to 'calm down' before the execution takes place.

Although a clergyman of the prisoner's choice is meant to be allowed to take their last rites, Brazilian Marco Archer was reportedly denied access to Cilacap's Catholic priest Charles Burrows and was so stressed in his last hours he said that he wanted to die sooner, but eventually had to be dragged bodily from his cell for transport to Nirbaya.
