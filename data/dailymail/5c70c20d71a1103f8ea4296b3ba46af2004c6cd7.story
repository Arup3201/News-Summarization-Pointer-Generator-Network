A crisis-hit hospital flew a doctor in from India at the cost of £5,000 for a single weekend because its A&E department was left without cover.

The consultant made a round trip of more than 8,000 miles to step in after the trust failed to find a local doctor.

For 48 hours, the jet-lagged doctor covered two consultants’ jobs at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. 

He worked a 12-hour shift before being on call for a further 12 hours of Saturday, sleeping for just six hours while another consultant from intensive care was on hand to help. He repeated the same shift pattern the next day.

It will add to fears that emergency departments are reaching breaking point, due to population pressures, the collapse of GP out-of-hours care and the ageing population.

Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ‘This shows just how chaotic the Scottish government’s long-term planning has been for NHS staffing.

‘They’ve been warned for years about shortages across all areas, and these warnings have been ignored.

‘Now health boards have been left in this preposterous situation where they have to hire short-term solutions from the other side of the globe.’

Across the UK there are thousands of unfilled nursing posts, but Aberdeen faces particular trouble recruiting due to the high cost of living, with house prices approaching London heights due to the oil industry.

NHS Grampian has refused to name the consultant who has been commuting from India to work in Aberdeen since the start of August.

He normally works on a fortnight-on, fortnight-off basis, but a consultant fell ill last weekend, resulting in bosses paying to fly him in.

Based on the average hourly rate for a local A&E consultant of £65, he would have been paid £3,120 for the 48 hours. But NHS Grampian pays locums more than that.

Dr Jean Turner, of Scotland Patients Association, said: ‘This just seems ridiculous.

‘Aberdeen should be a great place to stay and work and it is difficult to understand why we do not have the staff to cover for holidays, study leave, retirement and sickness.

‘If there is a need for a locum, it is strange that India is the nearest place to provide one to keep the NHS service going.

‘No matter how well qualified and experienced a locum is, working in a strange place will always have challenges for them compared to working as a permanent member of staff.’

An NHS spokesman said: ‘On this particular occasion, to cover short notice sick leave, we asked this doctor to provide cover over the weekend. The doctor is one of our long-term locums and works regularly in the department in Aberdeen.

‘Consultant cover was present throughout the weekend at all times. At no time has NHS Grampian been left without consultant cover.’
