Each week Sportsmail gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best Barclays Premier League starting XI of the day.

Eden Hazard, Mesut Ozil and Joey Barton feature in this week's list as they put in man-of-the-match performances that helped their teams win, but who else made the XI? Scroll down to find out. 

GK - Tim Howard (EVERTON vs Southampton) - 7

Had to be alert to James Ward-Prowse’s swerving effort, stretching a big hand out to his left in order to beat it away. Key to Everton's win.

DEF - Antonio Valencia (MANCHESTER UNITED vs Aston Villa) - 7.5

Industrious down the right flank, almost created a goal for Rooney with one surge; not tested defensively.

DEF - Marcos Rojo (MANCHESTER UNITED vs Aston Villa) - 7

Elegant on the ball, passed it well and came close to opening the scoring with a 30-yard drive that fizzed over the bar.

DEF - Phil Jagielka (EVERTON vs Southampton) - 7

DEF - Nacho Monreal (ARSENAL vs Liverpool) - 7

Solid defensive display, up against Lazar Markovic and Philippe Coutinho.

MID - Willian (CHELSEA vs Stoke City) - 7.5

A handful for Stoke as he, Oscar and Hazard linked up well to create chances in the first half, though they were never taken. Never short of a run.

MID - Joey Barton (West Bromwich Albion vs QUEENS PARK RANGERS) - 8

Name sung loud by travelling fans at the final whistle, in recognition of a fine display capped by a goal in added time to give this win an emphatic 4-1 scoreline.

Joey Barton was rightly praised for his efforts in QPR's emphatic 4-1 win over West Brom

MID - Ander Herrera (MANCHESTER UNITED vs Aston Villa) - 8.5

To think there was a time when he couldn’t get a game. Passing was excellent and his two goals were thoroughly deserved.

MID - Eden Hazard (CHELSEA vs Stoke City) - 8.5

A live wire. Master of the one-two and creating chances. Ultimately kept his cool from the spot to give Chelsea a much-needed lead before Adam’s equaliser. Didn’t look tired, despite his weariness during international break. Assisted the winning goal.

FWD - Loic Remy (CHELSEA vs Stoke City) - 7.5

Looked a worthy replacement for Costa as he twice went close to giving Chelsea the lead in the opening seven minutes. Scored in the second half when Mourinho really needed it, and it was deserved.
