Mandi Knight, 46, was left with facial burns after accidentally splashing her pony's drinking water on herself after suspecting it had been tampered with

A woman has been left with horrific facial burns after being accidentally splashed by her pony's drinking water  which had been spiked with a corrosive substance.

Mandi Knight, 46, accidentally splashed the water on herself as she moved the bucket of drinking water out of her pony's way at a livery yard in St Austell, Cornwall, after realising it was fizzing and had clouded over.

The mother-of-two had to be treated for 'excruciating' chemical burns after the substance – which was later identified by police as sodium hydroxide – caused her face to break out in ulcers and blisters.

Ms Knight believes her four-year-old pony Lolly's drinking water was targeted on purpose, after police confirmed it tested positive for the chemical, which is also known as caustic soda and is mainly used in industrial detergents and drain cleaners.

The highly corrosive substance can cause nausea, vomiting, blindness, stomach cramps and even death if ingested.

Ms Knight said her pony would have been horrifically burnt from the inside out had she ingested the harmful substance, but said the animal didn't consume any because workers were alerted in good time.

She said staff noticed the water when the animal started kicking its water bucket and, after contacting Ms Knight, called police to report the 'cloudy, frothing solution'.

Ms Knight said: 'I went to have a look and we noticed the water was cloudy with a lump of something like wallpaper paste at the bottom and it stank like an engine.

'There was a massive great lump of white stuff in the bucket which we believe was caustic soda.

'I picked the bucket up and didn't realise how heavy it was and some of the water splashed on my face.

'It immediately started to burn. The doctor said it was a chemical burn. They treated it with liquid paraffin and told me to put Vaseline on it.

'It was very painful. It felt like a bad case of sunburn. We poured some of it onto the grass and it scorched it. If lolly had swallowed it she would have died.

'It would have ulcerated her mouth and she would have burnt from the inside out.

'Lolly was so clever to know something was wrong with the water.' 

The 46-year-old mother of two said she suspected the water had been targeted after it clouded over and started fizzing. A white lump of water could also be seen at the bottom of the bucket containing the water

Ms Knight poured the water on a patch of grass to see if it was harmful and the corrosive substance immediately scorched the turf. Police said it tested positive for sodium hydroxide, also known as caustic soda

Police believe the pony's drinking water was targeted by the same culprit who stole a riding saddle from Ms Knight's shed overnight between October 14 and 15.

Ms Knight is now urging other horse owners to be vigilant to signs of tampering.

Sodium hydroxide, which is also known as caustic soda, is a chemical substance commonly used in detergents and drain cleaners. 

It is white, highly soluble in water, and is sold in the form of pellets, flakes and granules, as well as in solution.

If ingested, the substance can cause nausea, vomiting, blindness, stomach cramps and even death.

It is highly corrosive and can cause serious burns, redness, swelling and blindness, if put topically on the skin.

Those who come into contact with the substance should wash the contaminated area with large amounts of water and seek urgent medical attention immediately.

She said: 'It is a concern because a lot of children use the field where it happened. Other horse owners need to extra cautious concerning water.

'They need to look for a white lump like wallpaper paste which smells like an engine. Don't touch it unless you are wearing gloves as it burns.

'I would ask whoever has done this to stop wrecking ponies' lives.'

Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed it was investigating the incident, as well as the alleged burglary.

A spokesman said: 'Officers are investigating a report of a burglary and also suspicious circumstances of a bucket of corrosive liquid being found in the area.

'The burglary occurred sometime overnight between Tuesday 14 and Wednesday 15 October when entry was gained to a tack room and equestrian items stolen.

'A black bucket was also found in the area which is believed to have contained an unknown corrosive clear liquid. Some of this liquid may have been put into the horse's drinking water.

'Police are appealing for information and ask that anyone with any information please contact them.'
