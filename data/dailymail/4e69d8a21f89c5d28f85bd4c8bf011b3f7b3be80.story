Kevin Pietersen is enjoying some time away from cricket, by taking a breathtaking helicopter ride over the capital.

The former England cricketer, whose international career finished in February when the ECB decided not to consider him for future selection, posted two pictures on his Instagram account to show his 78,000 followers the view.

The first of which, taken next to the helicopter Pietersen flew in, shows the current Surrey player smiling before he boards his flight. 

The second photograph shows the view from the air, with Pietersen looking down over the Houses of Parliament, with stunning views across the rest of the capital.

It is currently unclear what Pietersen's next permanent cricketing move will be, as the South African born batsman continues to 'freelance' playing 20/20 cricket around the world.
