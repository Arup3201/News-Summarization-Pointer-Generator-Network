National Security Agency documents leaked by Edward Snowden reveal that both the American and British spied on delegates of other countries at two 2009 Group of 20 meetings.

The report indicates that Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters, an organization analogous to the NSA, set up internet cafes at the 2009 London Group of 20 conference with the purpose of reading the emails of those attendees who used them, among other spy tactics.

Also revealed were documents showing that the NSA was also actively monitoring London G20 attendees, specifically then Russian president Dmitry Medvedev.

The report came out hours before leaders of the Group of Eight countries - all of which are in the G20 - start a two-day summit in Northern Ireland.

The Guardian reports it had seen classified documents that detailed secret monitoring by British intelligence of officials at the April 2009 leaders summit and a finance ministers' meeting in September of that year and suggested it had been sanctioned at a senior level by the government of former prime minister Gordon Brown.

The monitoring included tapped Blackberry correspondences, both email and voice.

In its internet cafes, GCHQ reportedly placed keyloggers in the computers in order to gain ‘sustained intelligence options against them even after conference has finished.’

Which, reports New York Magazine, is a fancy way to say foreign officials’ login information could be used for GCHQ purposes in the future.

The surveillance and intelligence collection appeared to have been aimed at getting an edge in the meetings, against targets that included South Africa and Turkey, the report said.

British intelligence sought to determine if Turkey’s positions, set at the April meeting, had since shifted by the September 2009 meeting.

As calls made by the Turkish officials were monitored, British officials used the information gained as a means to "influence events on the ground taking place just minutes or hours later."

As for the NSA, the report revealed the Americans monitored correspondences of President Medvedev and his cohorts at the April 2009 summit.

The communications were reportedly intercepted through American spy hub Menwith Hill in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England where both American and British intelligence officials operate.

According to the Guardian, the report 
reads: ‘This is an analysis of signal activity in support of President 
Dmitry Medvedev's visit to London. The report details a change in the 
way Russian leadership signals have been normally transmitted. The 
signal activity was found to be emanating from the Russian embassy in 
London and the communications are believed to be in support of the 
Russian president.’

A 
spokesman for Britain's foreign ministry declined to comment to Reuters.
The Labour party, which held power in 2009, was not immediately 
available for comment.

The
Guardian this month reported details of surveillance by the U.S. 
National Security Agency of phone records and Internet data in the 
United States.

The 
newspaper said the evidence was contained in documents that were leaked 
by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and seen by the Guardian.
