Enraged: Robert Zimmerman Jr., pictured on Piers Morgan Tonight, launched a threatening Twitter tirade at the the Trayvon Martin family's attorneys

The older brother of George Zimmerman has launched a Twitter tirade on an attorney for Trayvon Martin's family, vowing to make it his life's work to disbar her.

Robert Zimmerman Jr.'s rant followed a week of television interviews in which he protested the innocence of his brother, who stands accused of killing the unarmed teenager in February.

The Zimmermans have been on a national media crusade over the past week - chatting with Piers Morgan and Spanish-speaking channels - to 'reintroduce' the family, who believe they have been misrepresented throughout the high-profile, divisive case.

On Monday, Robert Zimmerman Jr. marked the end of his press tour by unleashing his anger at attorney Natalie Jackson, blaming her for the false portrayal of his family.

'I hope GOD grants you a long life so 
you live to repent for what you have done,' he wrote on a tweet to her on Monday.

He went on: 'My Lifeâ€™s work = you WILL be held accountable for your words/actions. You AINT seen NOTHIN' yet... I will see U disbarred.'

And, in a reference to what critics have dubbed the 'scheme team' behind the case - attorneys Jackson and Benjamin Crump and Orlando publicist Ryan Julison - he added: 'The Scheme will be exposed, one by one, day by day - SHAME on you.'

Jackson quipped back: 'Please see my Rule #1: Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference - Mark Twain.'

Anger: Zimmerman, the brother of George Zimmerman, directed messages at attorney Natalie Jackson

His emotional outburst underscores the trouble the family has faced controlling their image, and the struggle the defense team endures to keep their client and his family in line.

Defense attorney Mark O'Mara told the Miami Herald that he 
cringed when he saw the rant and that the media tour had gone ahead without George Zimmerman's knowledge.

In their attempts to support their relative, the Zimmermans may be doing more harm than good, he suggested.

'I have been cautious with how we act in
this case and now someone with the same last name who does not act with
the same constraints is out there - and I have no control over him,' 
O'Mara said.

It is just another debacle for the defense team. They faced an early struggle after nationwide protests called for the arrest of Zimmerman, who they claimed attacked 17-year-old Trayvon because he was African American.

After Zimmerman was released from prison after bailing himself out, he ended up back behind bars and on a new bail after the courts accused him about failing to reveal the extent of his legal funds.

Then, last month, Zimmerman's best friend published a book full of errors about how Trayvon died - but ended up on the prosecution's evidence list, the Herald reported.

Robert Zimmerman Jr., 31, decided to stand up for his family - who have all gone into hiding since the case arose - and travelled to Los Angeles last week to carry out interviews.

Family support: Robert Jr. has appeared on a number of TV and radio shows this week to speak against the portrayal of his brother and his family by the media

His aim, he said in an email to 
reporters, was to 'reintroduce the Zimmerman family' and he was the only
person authorized to speak on their behalf.

He went on to appear on radio and television shows in Los Angeles, where he painted his brother as a hard-working man attacked by the teenager and demonised by the media.

He also appeared on Piers Morgan Tonight with his mother, who had her face obscured, before taking to his Twitter account for the attack on the Martin lawyer.

In an email to the Herald, he stood by his rant, saying: 'I
don't want her to be able to use her position as an attorney to 
assassinate anyone else's character or to ever hurt anyone else's 
family.'

Fight: Attorneys for Zimmerman said the Twitter rant will not have helped their already troubled case. Here, supporters of Trayvon Martin hold a rally in March, calling for Zimmerman's arrest

His brother, 29, has been charged with second-degree murder for the February 26 shooting in Sanford, Florida.

Trayvon was found to be just carrying Skittles and iced tea when he was killed, but Zimmerman's attorneys claim he acted in self defense when the teenager tackled him.

The team has requested that Trayvon's school records and social media posts be released as part of the trial. A hearing for the request will be heard on October 19.
