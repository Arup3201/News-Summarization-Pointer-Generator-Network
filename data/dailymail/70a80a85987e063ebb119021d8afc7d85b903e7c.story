It was the car designed to rival the Mini and revive the Scottish motoring industry.

After the Hillman Imp was launched in 1963, 11,000 workers built almost half a million of them at the Rootes factory in Linwood, Renfrewshire.

But 13 years after it was launched, production ceased.

Yesterday, 50 years after the first Imp rolled off the production line, around 100 enthusiasts gathered at St James Business Centre on the site of the former factory.

A commemorative plaque was unveiled before a convoy of 50 Imps set off on a 300 mile trip to Coventry, where the car manufacturer was based.

Ernie Payne, 67, from Johnstone, Renfrewshire, was among those paying tribute to the Imp.

He joined Rootes as an apprentice in 1962 and met his wife Anne, 66, while working at the factory.

On his 21st birthday in 1967, Mr Payne was given a white Imp by his parents, and the car became his ‘pride and joy’.

Legacy: The Hillman Imp Club and The Association of Rootes Car Clubs gathered to mark the anniversary of the car by holding a rally from Paisley to Coventry where the headquarters of the Rootes Group is based 

He said: ‘It was a very good car – it was way above the Mini at that time. Unfortunately it got bad publicity, but it was probably ten years ahead of its time.

‘When the plant closed it was a  disaster for the whole area.’

The Duke of Edinburgh drove the first Imp produced at Linwood when he opened the factory in 1963.

That car is now on display at the Riverside Museum in Glasgow.

Between 1963 and 1976, 440,000 Imps were made. Despite the car’s reputation for poor reliability around 4,000 survive. The Linwood plant closed in 1981, marking the end of Scots car manufacturing.
