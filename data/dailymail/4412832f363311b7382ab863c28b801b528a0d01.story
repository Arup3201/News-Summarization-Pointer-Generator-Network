This is the moment a masked robber brandished a running chainsaw to frighten off anyone who may try to intervene while his gang mates raided a jewellery shop.

The robbery, which took place in Wakefield in April last year,was just one of a series of heists across West Yorkshire in which the thieves took off with an estimated £250,000 worth of cash and jewellery.

Leeds Crown court heard how the gang of four men used chainsaws, pickaxes, sledgehammers and knives during the violent raids which have cost them 57 years behind bars.

One of the gang members stood outside Mr Hussain's shop in West Yorkshire wielding a running chainsaw to scare off any passers-by that tried to intervene during the raid

In one attack, three of the men plundered £150,000 of stock and £4,000 of cash in just four minutes after forcing shop owner, Nasir Hussain to the ground.

The masked robbers smashed display cases with pickaxes and shoveled the jewels into a skip sack  while their partner-in-crime stood outside, waving the chainsaw around in a bid to frighten off passers-by.

Mr Hussain tried to chase the perpetrators after they made their getaway in a stolen Audi but was stopped short after they switched vehicles. The stolen car was found nearby having been set on fire.

Before ransacking Mr Hussain's shop, WS Jewellers, the group had already robbed Sona Jewellers in Huddersfield using similar tactics.

The thieves arrived at the store in a stolen Range Rover on February 25 last year carrying hammers. They transferred the expensive jewellery into builders' bags before taking off.

Their next target was Assad Jewellers in Batley on March 8 where, armed with pieces of wood and a large knife, the men forced their way in by reversing Volkswagen Transporter through the door.

The owners managed to prevent them from coming in, but one member of staff suffered a slash to his arm and required hospital treatment.

The court heard how the masked men also used sledgehammers during the terrifying attacks.

Gang members Patrick 'Mandy' Lowther, 33, Steven Barker, 35, and Garner Smith, 33, were all jailed for 16 years after being convicted of conspiracy to rob.

Fellow plotter John Boy Morrison, 40, was jailed for nine years after the judge ruled he had less involvement than the others.

Judge Tom Bayliss QC said: 'The target of this conspiracy was a number of Asian jewellery shops in the area of West Yorkshire.

'The distinction between such shops and high street jewellers is they are often in quiet residential areas and often occupied by (lone) proprietors.

'In other words they present a soft target. But these yield valuable rewards to men like you.'

The men from Guildersome, Rothwell and Bradford denied conspiracy to rob but were convicted after a three week trial.

Nasir Hussain was forced to the ground by three of the thieves while they raided his shop, WS Jewellers in Wakefield. The group of men stole £150,000 worth of Mr Hussain's stock and £4,000 in cash

Judge Bayliss said: 'You knew exactly which part of the premises was most vulnerable. You knew what to go for in the shop.

'These were highly sophisticated, highly professional, well organised and carefully planned robberies.'

After the case, Mr Hussain, 38, said: 'I was in shock because it happened so quickly and these guys were so professional.

'I realised there was somebody outside in the street who had got a running chainsaw. I could hear it and he was waving it.

The father-of-four added: 'They are cold-blooded thieves. They are taking somebody’s livelihood. In four minutes they just took everything away. They got what they deserved.'

Det Insp Paul Harrison, of Wakefield CID, said it was the first time in his 30-year career he had seen a chainsaw being used as a weapon of fear.

'There were a number of people around the shop. One certainly tried to approach this man.

'This chainsaw was actually activated. I have no doubt whatsoever the person with the chainsaw would have caused harm if they’d got closer.'
