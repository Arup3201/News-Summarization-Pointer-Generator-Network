Jefff Walker, 55, was found shot dead on the slopes of Aspen

The body of a skier who had been missing for two weeks was found shot dead in an out-of-bounds area of Aspen Highlands.

Wine expert Robert Jefferson Walker, known as Jeff, was found by a snowboarder in the Grey Area, which is owned by the U.S. forest service and is permanently closed to skiers.

He was found with a gun next to his body. Sheriff Joe DiSalvo told the Aspen Times: 'There is no evidence of foul play. But we 
investigate all deaths as if they were homicides.'

An autopsy is expected to take place today.

Mr Walker, who was an experienced skier, was last seen hiking in the Highland Bowl on March 7 wearing a reflective jacket.

He was reported missing by family and friends on March 9 after he failed to return home from the hiking trip.

A search operation organised by Mr Walker's brother, Buzz, took place in an attempt to find him and $18,000 was raised towards the search effort.

Mr Walker's girlfriend Liz Sathe consulted three separate psychics in the hope it would shed light on his disappearance.

She passed information from the psychics over to mountain rescue as to the type of terrain Mr Walker was thought to have been hiking in when he went missing.

On Tuesday, one day before Mr 
Walker's body was found, Ms Sathe told the Aspen Times: 'They all feel 
strongly that this is a critical day because Jeff canâ€™t scream anymore.'

A Facebook page set up to aid the search for Mr Walker has been flooded with tributes in his memory.

Gerald Theron said: 'You went way too soon but man did you leave an lasting impression on all who knew you. I know you have found peace.'

Tara Marolda said: 'You will be sorely missed and your life will be celebrated by all who loved you.'

Janis Rubenson Skinner said: 'My prayers go out to Jeff's family and to everyone in the Aspen community who never gave up. He was part of an amazing Aspen Family.'

Jeff Walker last scanned his ski pass at the Exhibition ski lift at 12.04 on March 7. His body was found in an out-of-bounds area of the Aspen Highlands, known as the Grey Area
