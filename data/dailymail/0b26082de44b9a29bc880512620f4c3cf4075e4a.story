Prince Charles admitted today that his action man days were behind him as he chatted to surfers on a Cornish beach.

The heir to the throne, considered something of a heart throb in his day and who frequently drew admiring glances from women on sun-kissed beaches around the world, said ruefully that he was 'past his sell-by date'.

The prince and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, were visiting the surfing mecca of Watergate Bay near Newquay, Cornwall, as part of a three-day trip to the West Country.

Surf's up! Charles met with a group of young surfing chefs at surfing mecca Watergate Bay, Cornwall

something of a heart throb in his day

Charles recalled the days when his bronzed body was a regular sight on boards at nearby resorts such as Constantine and Polzeath on the county's north coast.

His sons, William and Harry still regularly go surfing in the area but Charles, 65, told the beach's RNLI lifeboat manager Steve Instance: 'I'm past my sell by date for surfing.'

But his return to the coast briefly made him long for those days again.

Down on the beach he met with some surfing chefs - a group of students from Camborne College near Redruth who are on a placement at Jamie Oliver's Fifteen restaurant immediately above the cove. 

Everybody go surfing... except for Charles: the Prince said 'I'm past my sell-by date for surfing'

Envious: Charles told one young surfer that he wished he could return to the water-sporting days of his youth

One of them, Carla Viladonmat, 25, said the Prince had told her he was envious of them.

'He said that he had done it himself quite a few years ago and wished he could get back out there now,' she said.

The Prince and Camilla also spent time chatting with a group called Surf Action, who teach the sport to military veterans, many suffering post traumatic stress disorder, to help them to adjust to life after war service.

Rich Emerson, one of the charity's founders and a former Lance Corporal in the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, said it had helped him come to terms with life when he was living in a Cornish cave after serving in the first Gulf War.

'It's something to do with the salt water. You get a lot of positive vibrations in the salt water,' he said.

'We mainly deal with a lot of post traumatic stress.'

Charles and Camilla also met formerly unemployed apprentice chefs at the Fifteen, which is run by Jamie Oliver but managed by the charity Cornwall Food Foundation.

It trains the apprentices on an intensive 16-month course designed to use the magic of food to unlock their potential and create the chefs of the future.

Later the Duchess used a visit to the award winning Camel Valley Vineyard near Bodmin to call on English wine producers to come up with an alternative name for sparkling wine to rival champagne.

Only wine produced in the Champagne region of France can use the name but the Duchess described how sparkling wine made in the UK was "very good".

Sampling a glass of bubbly - a glass of sparkling wine from 2011 called Annie's Anniversary - the Duchess said: 'I think we should come up with an idea for British sparkling wine because it's champagne and very good champagne - it should have a special name.'

School days: Camilla meets Ben and Scarlett from Ben and Scarlett from Padstow School

Camilla's father Major Bruce Shand was a wine merchant and passed on his love for whites, reds and rose to his daughter, who is now president of the United Kingdom Vineyards Association.

To mark her trip to the Camel Valley Vineyard, Camilla, who celebrates her 67th birthday today, was presented with a Methuselah  of sparkling rose wine - containing nine bottles.

Camel Valley was started by Bob and Annie Lindo 25 years ago when they converted their livestock farmland to growing vines and, with their son Sam, have gone on to great success.

Their wines have won international awards and a sparkling variety was used in the toasts at a Commonwealth leaders summit in Sri Lanka last autumn hosted by the Prince of Wales.

Each year the vineyard produces 100,000 bottles of wine of all types from grapes grown on south facing slopes in an idyllic part of north Cornwall.
