Miracles: Conjoined twins Hope and Faith passed away on Tuesday after surviving a miracle birth on May 8

'You have to see it to believe it,' the girls' mother Renee Young earlier told Woman's Day.

'Sometimes Faith will cry and wake Hope up, who then looks sideways as if to say, "Thanks for that".

'We are blessed we've got this far. I just find them adorable.

The girls survived a miraculous birth on May 8 and were christened on May 8.

They were born with the extremely rare condition known as disrosopus - which leads to a baby with two faces.

Less than 40 people in history are believed to have suffered from the condition.

She went into labour at just 32 weeks and the girls survived a miraculous and extremely rare birth.

'We sort of looked at it as; it'd be the same as being a child with autism or Down syndrome. I sort of don't believe in terminating the baby if it's healthy and growing fine and everything is going to plan,' said Mr Howie.

The tiny girls shared all their major organs except for two separate brains.

Soon after news of the girls' deaths broke, tributes began pouring in on social media.
