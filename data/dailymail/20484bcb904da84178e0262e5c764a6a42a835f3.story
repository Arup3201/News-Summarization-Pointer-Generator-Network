If Jodie Williams forgets the dark moments amid the joy of being back to her best for the Commonwealth Games, a quick glance at her wrists will remind her. ‘Pain is temporary’ is inked on the left, ‘Victory is forever’ on the right.

‘It’s quite ironic really as it’s one of the most painful parts to get tattooed,’ says the English sprinter before explaining the significance.

‘When things are tough, it feels like the whole world is against you and you can’t see a way out. But when you’re standing on top of the podium you aren’t thinking about the struggles, you’re just thinking how amazing that moment is. The hard times don’t last forever.’

Fulfilling her potential: British sprinter Jodie Williams feels she is finally starting to display her promise

Frustrating: Williams had difficult 2012 and 2013 seasons as she struggled to step-up to senior level

Williams had the tattoo done a year ago after an underwhelming 2013 season. It had been scarcely better than 2012 when her dream of competing at a home Olympics ended at the trials in Birmingham. She finished in a crumpled heap halfway down the track, sobbing with the pain of a pulled hamstring.

Williams said: ‘Physically your body heals quite quickly and it wasn’t such a serious injury that I had to take a lot of time out but I had a few small injuries one after another and it almost feels like everyone’s against you and you’re never going to come back. I was fit during 2013 but I was still struggling massively with my confidence.

‘I’ve always been quite against sport psychologists because I’m not very good at discussing things. It was just about getting races under my belt so it took me a long time but each time I was chipping away at it and slowly exorcising those demons.’

Reminder: Williams has 'pain is temporary' and 'victory is forever' tattooed on her wrists

Williams burst onto the international sprinting scene at 15 when she won the 100m and 200m titles at the World Youth Championships. After going unbeaten over five years in 151 races as a junior she was nicknamed ‘money legs’ by those who predicted she would race to riches. Even her former coach Mike McFarlane said his charge, then 16, could be ‘the best athlete in the world if we box clever’.

Williams is now starting to show the same promise as a senior. At the Glasgow Diamond League last week, she recorded the fourth- fastest 200m by a British female, clocking 22.60sec — knocking 0.16sec off her personal best and announcing herself as a medal contender at the Commonwealth Games. It is easy to forget she is still only 20.

‘It would be great if people could bear that in mind,’ she says. ‘People generally think I’m 23 or 24 and when I correct them and tell them this is only my second year as a senior they’re surprised.

Success: Williams ran the fourth-fastest time by a British female in the 200m in Glasgow last week

‘It’s only after having those years out that I’ve looked back and thought “Wow, there was a big thing about me around at that time, a big buzz, and that was an awful lot of pressure to be dealing with at a young age”.

‘Some people wrote me off very quickly but it takes a little while to translate to the seniors. I’ve still hopefully got a good five years until I reach my peak.’

Williams’s victory in the national trials in Birmingham this month prompted her to say: ‘I finally feel I’m mentally back to the athlete I was. I wanted to be Olympic champion. Because I was so young I had no fear, I thought anything was within my grasp. As I got older I lost that but I think it’s what made me the athlete I was and I’m getting that back now.’

Dip: Williams endured a difficult 2012 and 2013 but she believes she is over that blip now
