A Muslim teacher once jailed by
Canada as a security threat has been accused of radicalizing four teenage students who have allegedly fled to Syria to fight with the Islamic State.

Four men and two women, aged 18 and 19, left Montreal in January and February for Turkey and then on to Syria, according to media reports.

Adil Charkaoui teaches Arabic and the Quran at two Montreal community colleges, where the teenagers studied before they went missing.

Suspending his classes, both schools have accused Moroccan-born Charkaoui of spreading radical Muslim ideals. 

Charkaoui, an anti-Islamophobia advocate, denied the allegations on Friday, insisting he only had brief contact with one of the six students.

Accused: Arabic teacher Adil Charkaoui has been suspended by two colleges after six students fled to Syria

He denies allegations he radicalized the 18- and 19-year-olds as he says he only briefly met one of them once

He told a press conference on Friday that anti-Muslim prejudice in Quebec is to blame for alienating Muslim students, not his classes, where he said only Arabic, the Koran and 'basic notions' are taught.

Charkaoui was granted Canadian citizenship in July 2014, 11 years after he was arrested and accused of training with Al Qaeda.

After being detained, he was monitored for six years before Canada dropped the case against him.  

The students are the latest in a string of
young Westerners who have become radicalized and have headed to
the Middle East hoping to fight with Islamic State.

Charkaoui said only one of the departed students took a course at
his school, which rented classroom space from two colleges in
the Montreal area. Both colleges have canceled rental contracts
with Charkaoui, accusing him of radicalizing students.

'Having checked the facts, I can tell you that individual
was registered with the school but only attended two classes,
not two months as reported... after that he left the class,'
Charkaoui told a news conference in Montreal.

'I'm stunned by the twisted logic of the spokespersons of
the two (colleges) and the pseudo-experts that are blaming
radicalization of young people for what has happened,' he added,
noting that his school does not support Islamic State.

Classes proceeded as usual on Friday at the College de
Maisonneuve, a 5,000-student pre-university and technical
college in Montreal where three of the teenagers studied.

'I didn't see anything strange with them. They prayed like
everyone else,' said student Marwa Durouoch, 18, who said she
knew the three teenagers.

But Durouoch, who wears a head scarf, also expressed deep
feelings of frustration with what she perceives as a lack of
religious freedom for Muslims in Quebec.

'We're in a prison here. We're not allowed to practice our
religion ... They're in the process of copying France,' she
said, noting that she and many fellow students want to leave the
French-speaking province.

Her frustration echoed that of one of the departed students,
Shayma Senouci, who in 2013 called on Facebook friends to sign a
petition against Quebec's 'Charter of Values', proposed
legislation that had sought to prohibit public-sector employees
from wearing or displaying conspicuous religious symbols,
including Muslim headscarves.

The legislation died when the nationalist Parti Quebecois,
which spearheaded the Charter, lost power in last year's
provincial election, but tensions between Muslims and
non-Muslims in Quebec remain.

Senouci's Facebook account included a video of a Muslim
woman being harassed on a Montreal bus with a one-word comment:
'disgusting', and was punctuated with posts last year in support
of Gaza, calling the Israeli action there a 'genocide', and
several referencing the Koran.

Montreal Police declined to comment on the case of the six
students. Officials at College de Maisonneuve also declined
comment.

Canada had tried to deport Charkaoui, an outspoken
Moroccan-born advocate against Islamophobia, arresting him in
2003 and keeping him imprisoned or under surveillance for six
years under a security certificate, based on classified
information from Canada's spy agency.

Ottawa claimed Charkaoui had trained at an al Qaeda camp in
Afghanistan. The government eventually withdrew its case against
Charkaoui rather than endanger the spy agency's sources. He was
granted Canadian citizenship in July 2014.
