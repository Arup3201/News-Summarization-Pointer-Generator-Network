Hands-on: Ed Miliband holding his newborn son Samuel in 2010. The Labour leader has floated plans to double the length of paternity leave and increase statutory paternity pay from £100 a week to £260

New fathers are to be offered a month of paternity leave under a £150million Labour plan to encourage them to be more hands-on with their children.

Labour leader Ed Miliband today promises a sharp increase in paternity pay to £260-a-week – the equivalent of the minimum wage – so more working fathers can afford to take time off.

But the plan has faced some criticism from business leaders, who warn it will cause uncertainty and staff shortages for employers, especially small firms.

It comes after Labour has faced sustained criticism for being anti-business. 

But the party claimed 'good' businesses will welcome the policy as a way to encourage both men and women to stay in work. 

Mr Miliband unveiled the 'Father's Month', expected to help 400,000 men a year, as part of a coordinated push of family-friendly policies.

It includes increasing free childcare for three and four year olds from 15 to 25 hours a week and guaranteeing breakfast and after school clubs from 8am to 6pm.

He said: 'The modern British family needs government to be more flexible in what it does to help.

'Parents work long and stressful hours, at different times of the day, and it is increasingly tough to balance this with giving our kids the best start in life they can get.'

Mr Miliband, a father of two sons, said more and more fathers want to play a hands-on role in childcare particularly but are 'frustrated by out-dated laws and entitlements'.

He criticised the Tory plan for a married couple's tax break, which will cost £700million but only help one in five families with children.

'At the heart of Labour's plan, is the belief that Britain succeeds when modern working families succeed,' Mr Miliband said.

'That means giving Dads, as well as Mums, the chance to spend more time at home in the those crucial weeks after babies have been born.'

The idea of offering fathers a month off work when they have a child was first put forward last year by the left-leaning IPPR think tank. Labour claims it would benefit up to 400,000 families a year.

Under existing rules new fathers qualify for a statutory £138.18 a week, equivalent to £3.45 an hour for a 40-hour week, with employers encouraged to make up the gap in the employee's usual pay. Only just over half of new fathers (55 per cent) take it up at present.

Bringing the taxpayer-funded contribution up to minimum wage level would increase take-up to around 70 per cent, the IPPR estimates, at a cost to the Treasury of around £150 million in 2015-16.

Mr Miliband insisted the modern British family 'needs government to be more flexible in what it does to help'

Mr Miliband today met Sarah Phillis and her son Milo at her home in Peckham, south east London, as he unveiled plans for a significant boost to paternity leave if it wins the election 

Ed Miliband today spoke of his fear that being leader of the Labour party means he does not see his children enough.

He insisted that being a father was more important than being Labour leader, but struggles to find time for his wife Justine and his family.

Appearing on ITV's This Morning, he said: 'I’ve got two young boys of four and five and the greatest pleasure in life is spending time with them and Justine.

'It is really hard because like many, many parents, you’re working long hours and you become more and more aware of how important that quality time is.

Part of the thing I’ve learnt to try and do is try and carve out that time with them, mainly obviously at weekends, but to carve out that time because I don’t want them to think of me as a dad who wasn’t around.

'My job as leader of the Labour party is important but my most important job is being a good dad.'

With the party's spending plans under close scrutiny ahead of the election, Labour said House of Commons figures showed its policy of extending free childcare to three and four-year-olds - paid for by a bank levy - would save 'significantly' more in tax credits than the cost of the extra paternity pay.

'The modern British family needs government to be more flexible in what it does to help,' Mr Miliband said. 'Thanks to the last Labour government, fathers have two weeks' paid paternity leave.

'Millions of families have benefited, with parents saying this has helped them support each other, share caring responsibilities and bond with their children. But the money isn't great - and too many dads don't take up their rights because they feel they have to go back to work so they can provide for their family.'

He pointed to the party's weekend announcement that it would end the 'crazy' situation of underused and mothballed Sure Start children's centres by restoring an obligation on councils to provide childcare via them.

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said using private and charity providers would mean 50,000 new places could be laid on at no cost to the taxpayer - a claim disputed by campaigners.

The Pre-School Learning Alliance welcomed the commitment to restore facilities but said 'it would be short-sighted to suggest that such an initiative would not require additional funding from government'.

Labour says increased paternity pay will be funded via the current tax credit budget. 

Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves, who is expecting her second baby, dismissed the concerns, dismissed the concerns of business about the impact of the plan

Last year when the plans were floated, BCC executive director of policy Adam Marshall said: 'Parental leave has changed more than five times already over the past decade, and every time it changes employers face significant adjustment costs.'

Last night John Longworth, BCC director general, said: 'The 'father's month' amounts to a tax on business. 

'Although well-meaning, proposals such as this create very real costs for businesses, which can in turn lead to reduced productivity, reduced growth and fewer jobs,' he said.

'It also raises the spectre of a dad being off for a month, returning to work for a couple of weeks, and then asking for shared parental leave as soon as he is eligible – which could be hugely disruptive to small and mid-sized firms whose success depends on the talents and contributions of each employee.' 

But Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves, who is expecting her second baby, dismissed the concerns.

She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'This is exactly what people used to say about maternity leave, that it was a big burden on businesses. But the reality is, what good businesses know, is that it is really important to keep women in the workplace once they have children and not let them drift off because they can't manage work and family life. That's increasingly the case for dads.'

'Good employers like Asda, National Grid and Citibank are already giving more than the statutory paternity leave.'

'What good businesses know is that unless they give that flexibility to mums and dads, they are likely to lose their best employees as they will go to a business that does value them, or they will sadly drop out of the workforce altogether.'
