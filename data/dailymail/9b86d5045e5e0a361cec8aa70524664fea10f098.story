A Chinese man who has been left with a memory that lasts just five minutes has found the only way he can cope is to continually write down every detail of his life in a precious notebook.

Chen Hongzhi, 25, from Hsinchu county, Beipu, suffered a serious head injury in a car accident when he was a teenager which has left him with virtually no memory, The People's Daily reports. 

He writes down everything - from the people he meets in the street to the weather - as his injury means he has to start from scratch each day.

Memory book: Chen Hongzhi uses the notebook to write down people he meets and what he does each day after being left with a five-minute memory following a car crash

Chen suffered the severe brain injury in a car accident when he was 17 and spent months in intensive care in hospital. 

While his body recovered, his memory loss is still so severe that he often forgets things that happened between five and 10 minutes ago.

The debilitating condition also means that Chen cannot remember how to write properly, so he makes notes in a phonetic 'scrawl' that mostly only he understands.

'This is my record, I write in it everyday, even if it is pouring down with rain or if I don't go out to do the weeding I still l must write, "Heavy rain",' he said. 

'Whenever I get home from any time away  I quickly grab my notebook and write down important things from the day - who I've met, what I've done, how much money I got from recycling bottles, all that sort of stuff.'

Dependants: Chen Hongzhi with his mother Wang Miao-chiong, who starts the day by handing Chen his notebook and reminding him he is no-longer 17. They are reliant on each other following the recent death of his father

Every day when Chen wakes up, his mother, Wang Miao-chiong, must remind him that he is no longer 17 and eight years have passed.

She hands him the notebook so he can read what has happened in his life since the accident and check important details like who his friends are and what needs to be done that day. 

Chen's story has spread online in China after it was compared to that of the fictional character played by Nicole Kidman in the film Before I Go to Sleep.

His condition means Chen is unable to hold down a job so he raises a small amount of money by walking several kilometres collecting plastic bottles. Chen also collects wood that he and his mother use to make a fire to cook their food.

His mother, 60, said the practical system has kept Chen going for years, but she worries about what will happen to him after she has gone, particularly given the recent death of his father.

They get by on donations from neighbours and friends in the tiny village in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu County, who have given Chen the nickname 'short memory man' because he forgets having met them within 24 hours.

She said the family had initially hoped he would go back to school but soon realised there would be little point.

'It had been planned that would go back to school but there was no point as he could never remember the lessons, and has been living at home with me ever since.'

The pair are totally dependent on each other, with Chen having his mother there to reassure him about who he is and he, in turn, provides the physical strength to earn the money and carry out the household chores.

A severe hit to the head can injure the brain and cause both short and long-term memory loss.

Memory is easily damaged by brain injury because there are several structures in the brain are involved in processing information, storing it and retrieving it.

Damage to those parts of the brain can result in memory loss. 

Head injuries can trigger memory loss of the period immediately after the accident.

A person can appear to be relatively well, but everyday memory for events or conversations can be interrupted.  

They can also forget the time from before the brain injury – called retrograde and anteretrograde amnesia – and the gap in memory will range from a few minutes to a few months.

But the most common – and the most troublesome - type of memory loss is short term memory loss.

This can manifest itself in a variety of ways. 

Examples of this are forgetting what has just been said, having difficulty in learning a new skill, repeating the same question over and over, forgetting people's names, getting details mixed up, forgetting a change in routine and forgetting where things have been placed.

There is no guaranteed cure for this type of memory problem, and rehabilitation will try to help a person cope using tried and tested strategies.

However, memory is not like a muscle that can be developed just by stretching it.

After the death of his father, he was forced to step up his bottle collecting activities, where he was spotted by a traveller who was fascinated by his story, and posted on social media where it quickly spread.

Beipu village chief, Liu Chin-ting, said the family receives monthly support from Hsinchu County's social welfare department, which is helping the family to get by.

Welfare workers also make it a point to visit Chen and his mother during festive holidays, he said.

But Liu said he believes the boy could still have a future if there was a medical facility that was prepared to take in and give him proper physiotherapy and training.

He said: 'He needs to get some preparation because his mother won't be there forever, and maybe they can get to the point where he can even hold down a regular job'.

The family have been flooded with offers of people wanting to send money but Chief Liu, who is helping to negotiate, said what they really need now is is practical everyday donations like tissue paper, rice, salt and soy sauce.

He said: 'Once the basics are sorted out, perhaps it might be possible to look at taking the time to find something more for the mid-term and long-term, but at the moment they just need to survive.'

Chen meanwhile is clearly happy, as his diary notes that kind donations of money have been flooding in and he's very happy that people want to help.

He knows he is destined to forget everything, but also knows that nothing he can do about that except keep his sense of humour.

He said: 'I am reading here about all the people that want to give me money, but I would say don't give me too much, because it looks as if I'll probably forget where I put it all.'

In the film Before I Go to Sleep, 40-year-old Christine Lucas, played by Nicole Kidman lives a life where she wakes up every day forgetting what has gone on the day before. 

In a remarkable similarity, she has to remind herself by writing notes each day about what has happened to her since the car accident.
