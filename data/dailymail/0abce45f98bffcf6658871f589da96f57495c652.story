The drone of two Russian nuclear bombers passing along Britain’s South Coast and endangering our civilian airliners should be a deafening wake-up call to our leaders about the threat we face from Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

Two Typhoon fighters — which can travel at twice the speed of sound — scrambled on Wednesday from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland and RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, screeching through British skies to intercept the Russian Bear Tu-95s, unexpected and unwelcome guests off our shores.

Detected first by our Norwegian allies, the Russian planes were then ‘spotted’ by RAF radar stations in Staxton Wold in Yorkshire and Neatishead in Norfolk.

In the ultra-secure bunker of RAF Boulmer in Northumberland, home of our Aerospace Surveillance and Control Systems Force Command, RAF officers flashed signals to Whitehall, and Britain’s military HQ in Northwood outside London.

Within seconds, the decision was made to scramble the battle-ready Typhoons.

Although the Bear bombers came with no fighter escorts, and could have been shot down before they had a chance to launch any nuclear warheads, the episode was still a deeply unsettling reminder of Russia’s ceaseless belligerence.

For this is not the first time the Kremlin has recently tested our reactions and resolve: in November, our fighters were scrambled twice in a week when Bear bombers were identified over the North Sea, and there have been scores of other similar incidents in recent years.

For too long, our defence chiefs have for political reasons played down the Russian activity, loath to worsen relations with the Kremlin.

Incredibly, back in 2008, for example, a Russian supersonic bomber carried out a dummy nuclear attack on northern England. It came within 90 seconds of our airspace before turning away, and had been approaching with a velocity and angle of attack known as ‘unfriendly posture’. In other words, exactly what it would do if it was on a real bombing run.

The Ministry of Defence press office flatly denied this had taken place — until disgruntled RAF officers leaked the story to the newspapers.

After this week’s close encounter — which forced the authorities to reroute civil aircraft over the Channel — Britain’s response has been tougher.

The pin-striped smoothies at the Foreign Office — normally a blob of timidity and caution when it comes to relations with Russia — scrambled, too, hauling in the Russian ambassador to Britain for a dressing down.

We should have done this years ago, for make no mistake, Russia’s aim in all this is to intimidate and humiliate. Not strong enough to mount a full-scale attack, it can still be hugely menacing.

On orders from Putin, the Russian warplanes fly with their transponders — devices which emit an identifying signal — switched off, making them invisible to civilian air traffic. It is the aviation equivalent of driving a black HGV with its lights switched off at high speed through city streets at night.

This is insanely risky behaviour. In airspace off Denmark last year, it nearly led to a mid-air catastrophe, when a Russian plane came within a whisker of colliding with a civilian airliner that had just taken off from Copenhagen airport.

Hundreds of people would have been killed. The prospect of a military miscalculation is ever more frightening. What happens if one of these Russian warplanes is accidentally shot down by an RAF pilot, or one from a nervous Nato ally? We would be on the brink of World War III.

So why does Putin do it?

Defiant: Russian President Vladimir Putin believes the West

One reason is that these stunts also bring valuable military information. Russian electronic snooping devices monitor our reaction times. They see how well our pilots are trained, and what our warplanes can do. They want to know how they communicate with their bases, and how our chain of command works.

Such electronic intelligence-gathering is supplemented by the work of Russia’s human intelligence assets — spies, in plain language — who recruit and run sources in the defence establishments of Nato countries.

Knowing how your adversary reacts in an emergency gives crucial insights into how he will behave in war. And it is not just in the air that Russia is constantly testing us. Last year, a Russian flotilla of warships — bristling with electronic listening equipment — brazenly sailed up the Channel, ostensibly on the way to an exercise in the Mediterranean.

The only available vessel in our shrunken Navy had to sail at full speed halfway around Britain to intercept them.

And, under the ocean, Putin’s submarines lurk off our naval bases in Scotland on an even more sensitive mission. Their task is to listen for the distinctive ‘acoustic signatures’ of our nuclear submarines.

These vessels are the most important in Britain’s arsenal. They carry cruise missiles — and four of them are the launching pad for our ultimate deterrent: Trident.

But if the acoustic signature is detected, they no longer become invisible, silent killers. They are far easier to track — and to destroy. The bitter irony is that we ourselves no longer have the capability to identify these Russian submarines when they are lurking off our waters.

Five years ago, in one of the most extraordinary fiascos in the history of British defence procurement, we sacrificed our Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft, which had the capability to locate the Russian subs from the air. As a result, when Russian submarines again shadowed our naval vessels last year, we were forced to call on other countries for help.

In international airspace and on the high seas, these brushes may seem like a macho game. But it could have deadly consequences.

If Russia’s forces subvert or attack any of the Baltic states — perhaps in the guise of ‘peacekeepers’ dealing with a civil war — then Britain, as the Nato ally of the staunchly Anglophile Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, is solemnly bound to defend them.

In the event of such a crisis, the knowledge acquired by Russia from provocations such as this week’s could be crucial in dealing with anything our Armed Forces would try to do to fulfil Britain’s Nato obligations.

Those, then, are the military reasons behind Russia’s menacing of our borders. But there are other motivations for Putin to send a nuclear bomber close to Bournemouth.

First, there is the West’s response to Russia’s invasion of Crimea and violent incursions into Ukraine. The sanctions we have imposed are causing Putin’s economy great harm, especially in tandem with the tumbling oil price.

But I believe this week’s close call was also in response to the startling events in London, where a public inquiry has opened into the murder of the Russian exile Alexander Litvinenko in November 2006. On its first day, the hearing heard Putin accused of being a ‘common criminal’ who had ordered the murder. As you can imagine, this did not go down well in Moscow.

Litvinenko’s death by polonium poisoning should have convinced our leaders that Russia is a criminal state, run by thugs, prepared to silence its critics with reckless acts of nuclear terrorism. 

Closely watched: An RAF Typhoon jets shadows this Russian Bear H bomber over the North Atlantic Ocean in September 2007. On orders from Putin, the Russian warplanes fly with their transponders — devices which emit an identifying signal — switched off, making them invisible to civilian air traffic.

But for years our rulers put the preservation of diplomatic relations with Russia ahead of exposing the truth about one of the most infamous murders in our country’s history — just as they failed for too long to protest to Russia about the misbehaviour of its warplanes.

It is hard to overstate the threat the West now faces from Russia, both in terms of espionage and naked military threats.

An alleged spy ring was arrested in New York this week, and, yesterday, Putin’s armed forces chief declared that a strong nuclear arsenal will ensure military superiority over the West. He promised that the Russian military would receive more than 50 new intercontinental nuclear missiles this year.

Putin believes the West is finished: overstretched, decadent and discredited. The truth is we are not losing this spate of arm-wrestles because we are weak, but because our willpower is weak.

The mighty Roman Empire could easily have withstood the assault it faced in its last years. But it bickered, fiddled, dithered — and perished.
