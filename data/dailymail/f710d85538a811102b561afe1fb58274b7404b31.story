Alarming: A record 46.7 million Americans were enrolled for food stamps in June

At least 50 million Americans were unable to afford food at some point during last year and almost 17 million repeatedly ran short, forcing them to skip meals and cut back on daily essentials, alarming new figures reveal.

Women living alone, single-parent families and Black and Hispanic households were among those hit the worst.

Southern states saw the greatest food crises, and residents of inner cities nationwide suffered shortages.

The Department of Agriculture said in a report that about 5.5 per cent of American households, or nearly 17 million people, suffered 'very low food security' last year, a rise of 800,000 over the previous year.

The food-security report was released one day after the government said that a record 46.7 million Americans were enrolled for food stamps in June, up by 173,000 in May.

High unemployment and slow growth since the deep 2008-2009 recession has driven enrollment in food stamps, the major U.S. anti-hunger program, to record levels.

The cost of food aid to the poor is an election-year issue, with Republicans calling for large cuts in food stamps and Medicaid to help reduce the deficit. Democrats say the cuts are too deep.

This year is likely to be even more problematic for hunger prevention because jobless benefits are running out for tens of thousands of long-term unemployed workers, said Jim Weil, head of the anti-hunger group Food Research and Action Center.

The overall food-insecurity rate for individuals was 16.4 percent, almost unchanged since 2008, when it surged to the highest levels since the Agriculture Department began monitoring food security in 1995.

14.9 per cent of households were food insecure.

14.9 per cent of American households were food-insecure in 2011, or 16.4 per cent of individuals

Food-security issues were greatest in
the South, in inner cities across the nation, in families with a single
parent, in Black and Hispanic households and in households with 
children.

Mississippi and Arkansas were the states with the highest rate at 19.2 percent, and North Dakota was lowest at 7.8 per cent.

Almost everyone who experienced very low food security said they ran short of food and didn't have the money to buy more.

Some 97 per cent said they cut back on the amount they ate or skipped a meal, while 91 per cent said it happened often throughout the year.

Nearly half said they lost weight because they did not have enough to eat, according to the report.

People who regularly go without food because they can't afford it are considered to suffer 'very low food security'.

The highest percentages tend to be in southern states and inner cities.

Arkansas was the worst offender with 7.6 per cent of residents on very low food security.

In Alabama and Mississippi there were 7.1 per cent on very low food security.

7 per cent of the Oklahoma population fell into the category.

Missouri had 6.7 per cent in the very low bracket.

In Kentucky it was 6.6 per cent.

Maine and Texas were both on 6.5 per cent.

In Ohio, Georgia and Tennessee 6.4 per cent of people suffered very low food security.

People who on occasion go without food were deemed to suffer 'low or very low food security'.

Arkansas and Mississippi had 19.2 per cent on low or very low food security.

In Texas there were 18.5 per cent.

Georgia had 17.4 per cent.

In North Carolina 17.1 per cent of people were on low or very low.
