An Oklahoma girl has thanked her dentist for saving her life after a routine checkup lead to the discovery of a serious tumor.

Journee Woodard, 11, was having her teeth cleaned at her family dentist in Edmond when the dental hygienist noticed the white of her eyes seemed to be an unusual shade of yellow.

'She asked me to take a look, I took a look and said that does look abnormal,' the dentist, Dr Michael Chandler, told KFOR 4.

On Dr Chandler's advice, Journee's mother, Anna Woodard, took her daughter for a checkup.

Dentist: Dr Michael Chandler suggested Journee seek medical advice straight away after realizing her eyes were an 'abnormal' shade of yellow

Doctors were also worried about the color of Journee's eyes and ordered a CAT scan and MRI.

The results showed that Journee had a large mass on her liver and pancreas.

She was admitted to the University of Oklahoma Childrens Hospital straight away. 

According to a fundraising page set up on You Caring, the mass turned out to be a tumor that was the size of a grape fruit.

Doctors wasted no time in operating and rushed Journee into surgery.

They had to perform a Whipple procedure to remove part of Journee's pancreas, stomach, gall bladder and part of the intestine. 

Journee's mother said she remained in the ICU for the next seven to 10 days.

'Imagine taking your little girl to the dentist on a Monday morning for a routine cleaning, and by Friday, she is fighting for her life,' Mrs Woodard said.

On Wednesday Mrs Woodard said Journee had been taken off solid foods because of the amount of pancreatic fluid she is producing, but is otherwise in 'good spirits'.

'We are still anxiously awaiting the biopsy results and will update further. Thank you so much again for everyone's continued love, prayers, support and amazing generosity,' Mrs Woodard put on You Caring.

The family have so far raised over $5,000 on the website.

Mrs Woodard and her husband said their jobs do not offer paid time off and they are spending all their time in hospital with Journee.

'We are completely without any income to cover expenses for our other three kids, and any other funds raised will go to scratch the surface of medical expenses that her insurance won't cover, which has already exceeeded the $100,000 mark,' Mrs Woodard wrote.
