The clock at the Trinity Road End had ticked on to 60 minutes when, at long last, Aston Villa finally got a clear sight of goal.

Andreas Weimann nodded the ball into Christian Benteke’s path and, as he steadied himself, only one outcome looked possible. History suggests Liverpool crumble when pressure is applied and this looked like the moment when they would concede.

Standing firm, though, was Simon Mignolet. Benteke may have unleashed fury from his right foot, smashing his drive towards the Holte End net, but Mignolet - so often lampooned for his mistakes - would not be beaten.

The Belgian parried away Benteke’s blockbuster before leaping up to punch the loose ball off Weimann’s head. Moments later, when a corner was flung in as Villa tried to find a way through, Mignolet came charging out, bulldozing through everyone in front of him to claim possession.

This was more like it. Mignolet has had a poor season, his low point coming when he was dropped for the December 15 trip to Old Trafford, but here was a performance to show why he was bought. For the first time in a long while, he exuded the authority of a Liverpool No 1.

‘I thought he was outstanding,’ said Brendan Rodgers. ‘Simon wasn’t overly worked but he made two great saves when called upon. But what was really pleasing was how dominant he was. Benteke is nearly unstoppable in the air when he is challenging for the ball. But Simon came for a number of crosses and got contact with the ball and was really calm and composed and wasn’t flustered. The team as a whole defended very, very well but I was particularly pleased for him as he has had a wee bit of stick. I thought he was excellent.’

Mignolet wasn’t the only one. Liverpool were pushed hard by Villa, particularly in the second half, but they were resolute and didn’t look as if they would concede. That, certainly, is a sign they are making progress.

Defending has been Liverpool’s achilles heel under Rodgers. In his first campaign, they kept 21 clean sheets in 54 games. Last year, there were only 12 shut-outs in 43 matches, while this year the record is seven from 32 fixtures.

The picture, however, has changed dramatically recently. They have not conceded on their last three away trips at Burnley, Sunderland and Villa - the first time they have had such a run since 2008 - and this was the first time they had kept back-to-back clean sheets this campaign.

That big moment from Mignolet was crucial but so were the contributions of Mamadou Sakho, Martin Skrtel and Emre Can, the German midfielder who has slotted so effortlessly into a role on the right side of a back three. Jordan Henderson and Lucas Leiva were also key.

‘What a wonderful player he is,’ Rodgers enthused about Can, his £10million signing from Bayer Leverkusen. ‘He is a central midfield player but [in defence] his composure, calmness and strength against Benteke was very impressive.’

Bigger tests, of course, must be negotiated in the coming weeks but if Liverpool are to salvage a season that looked to be undermined by a bad back, this defensive renaissance has to continue. The free spirits might just be turning into the mean spirits.
