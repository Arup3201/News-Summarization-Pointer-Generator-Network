A father-of-five who ran a massive international sham marriage operation from his suburban family home has been jailed for six years.

Immigrant Talib Hussain, 42, was the ring-leader of a gang that flew Eastern European women to Islamabad for bogus weddings with Pakistani men, who could then apply to live in the UK under European open borders laws.

The scam - which Hussain orchestrated with the help of his ex-wife from his home in Rotherham, South Yorkshire - 'struck at the heart of the British immigration system', said a judge, as she sentenced 17 members of the gang for a combined total of more than 27 years at Sheffield Crown Court.

More than 60 applications for UK 
visas were submitted to authorities, accompanied by fake documents and 
photos of the bogus weddings.

But the UK Border Agency became 
suspicious when they noticed the same people appeared in many of the 
photos - and the same clothes were being swapped between brides, grooms 
and guests.

Today, Judge Rosalind Coe QC jailed 
Hussain, saying he was the 'hub' of the operation and his house in 
Rotherham was the 'engine room'.

Judge Coe said: 'This was a very large, well organised, professional operation involving very many people.

'At the very hub of this conspiracy and running the operation was Talib Hussain and others.'

Seventeen members of the gang were jailed for a total of 27 years and eight months at Sheffield Crown Court including nine fake brides - four Czech, four British Asian and a Slovak.

Judge Coe told them 
deterrent sentences were needed as the scam 'struck at the heart of the 
British immigration system.'

She said: 'Participating in sham 
marriages is a very serious matter. It is an abuse of the marriage 
ceremony itself and an abuse of the immigration system.'

The court had heard how Eva Holubova,
 19, flew to Pakistan with her boyfriend, also 19, to take part in fake 
marriage ceremonies and was 'married' three times in the space of four 
months.

She told police Pakistani men offered her £250 for photos to pretend they were married so they could get visas to go to the UK.

Her
 boyfriend Peter Pohodko, from Slovakia, also took part in the scam and 
was paid £300 for 'marrying' a 28-year-old Pakistani woman he claimed to
 have met on his wedding day.

The
 phoney weddings were staged in Pakistan with 'brides' posing with their
 'grooms' for photographs suggesting that they had got married.

One
 woman returned to the UK with £1,000 in her bag while another who went 
through a sham marriage already had a husband in the UK.

Guilty: Briton Sabina Khan (left), 46, was jailed for eight months, Slovakian Kristina Popikova, right, was jailed for 12 months

Involved: Nadia Qureshi, left, was jailed for six months for assisting unlawful immigration to a member state, Michaela Yengyelova, right will serve 11 months for conspiracy to breach the UK's immigration laws

As
 overseas nationals, the Pakistanis would have been granted leave to 
live in the UK as 'husbands' of their spouses who, as EU citizens had 
the right to live and work in the country.

The
 scam was discovered by staff at the British High Commission in 
Islamabad when they noticed the multiple documents supporting 
applications to marry and to settle in the UK were forged.

Immigration
 officers discovered the sham weddings took place in various private 
homes throughout the Mirpur district in the south-west of the Kashmir 
region. The ceremonies often married within hours or a few days of 
meeting one another.

Operation
 Razorback led to 18 men and women being convicted after trial or 
admitting conspiring to breach the UK's immigration laws or assisting 
unlawful immigration between August, 2009 and September, 2010.

Prosecutor
 Sarah Wright told Sheffield Crown Court it was a sophisticated 
conspiracy. She said: ‘This was a huge, well-organised and professional 
operation.’

She said the 
brides had no intention of living in ‘settled and genuine relationships’
 with the men and the sham marriages were clearly undertaken for 
immigration purposes.

A 
total of 62 fraudulent visa applications were traced to 32 addresses in 
the UK and the trail of false documents led to a semi-detached house in 
Rotherham where the main organisers, brothers Talib Hussain and Tariq 
Mehmood, 27, along with Talib's ex-wife, lived.

Mehmood is now on the run.

The address was described as the 
‘engine room’ of the conspiracy with Talib Hussain at its hub, and where
 many of the forged documents originated.

The
 three brought the brides and grooms together, booked the flights and 
arranged documents such as utility bills and bank statements - all for a
 small fee.

Hussain flew to 
Pakistan on numerous occasions with the fake brides and Mehmood booked 
the flights. Mohammed Ramzan, 59, Talib Hussain's brother-in-law, lived 
across the street from their house and played a supporting role. More 
fake documents were found here.

Ms
 Wright said of Talib Hussain: ‘He was charging considerable sums to 
Pakistani nationals who wanted to come to live in the UK.’

He was said to have a ‘considerable’ property in Pakistan.

Another support organiser Aftab 
Hussain, 36, flew to Pakistan with two of the brides. He said Talib 
Hussain paid £1500 for their air tickets and one of the women ‘posed for
 something which was not a wedding but had the appearance of a wedding.’

None of the 62 suspicious visa applications was granted, but some certificates of approval to marry were granted.

Talib
 Hussain was said to be the ‘most culpable’ of the gang but it was 
argued he did not make that much money out of it as his expenses in 
flights and paying the women were so high.

Many of the brides had modest means, the court heard.

Sabina
 Khan, 46, a single mother of three girls in the UK and a part-time 
lunchtime supervisor at a primary school was paid £300 for one sham 
marriage in Pakistan.

Mother-of-five
 Rahina Zaman, who was said to be poorly educated and reliant on 
financial support, went along with the scam although she didn't make any
 money out of it, the court heard.

Talib Hussain, of Rotherham, was 
jailed for six years and Zaman, also of Rotherham, was jailed for 
two-and-a-half years. They both admitted conspiracy to breach the UK's 
immigration laws.

Mohammed Ramzan, of Rotherham was 
jailed for three years and Aftab Hussain, 36, of Tinsley, for two years 
after admitting the same offence.

Eva
 Holubova, now 19, was given ten months in a young offenders institution
 and her boyfriend Peter Pohlodko, 19, both of Rotherham, got 21 months 
in a young offenders' institution after they were both convicted of 
conspiracy to breach the UK's immigration laws after a trial.

Sabina
 Khan, of Bradford, was jailed for eight months, Khalda Ahmed, 45, of 
Rotherham, got a seven-month jail term suspended for a year and Nadia 
Qureshi, of Sheffield, was jailed for six months after all three 
admitted assisting unlawful immigration to a member state.

Veronika Pohlodkova, 36, and Zuzana Holubova, 26, Kristina Popikova, 34, and Michaela Yengyelova, 30, all of Rotherham, admitted conspiracy to breach the UK's immigration laws.

Pohlodkova, who recruited the brides, was jailed for four years, Holubova for seven months, Popikova for 12 months and Yengyelova for 11 months.

Nikola Horvathova, 25, of Tinsley, was found guilty of the same offence after a trial and jailed for 12 months.

Svetlana Krausova, 31, of Tinsley, Farah Khan, 43, of Bradford, Louise Kelly, 27, of Bradford, and Mohammed Yasser, 22, of Bradford, all admitted assisting unlawful immigration to a member state.

Krausova, Khan, Kelly and her boyfriend Nasser were each jailed for eight months.

After the hearing Mark Bates of the UK Border Agency crime directorate said: 'This international crime group systematically abused the immigration system and showed a total disregard for the sanctity of marriage.'
