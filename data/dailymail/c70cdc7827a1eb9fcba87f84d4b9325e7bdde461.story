A young father shouted 'boom' as he threw a single punch which killed an innocent man who was trying to break up a pub fight.

Jake Sweeney's head was smashed on the pavement - cracking his skull in two - after Jason Grovell, 24, delivered the fatal blow outside the Irish Tymes pub in Caerphilly, South Wales.

Grovell had been drinking and taking cocaine with friends on a night out when one of the men got in a fight after the pub's closing time. 

Jason Grovell, 24, was today jailed for four years after punching Mr Sweeney so hard his skull cracked in two

Cardiff Crown Court heard that 26-year-old Mr Sweeny had tried to 'defuse' the situation by stepping between the two men.

But as he walked away he was struck on the side of his head by Grovell, who jumped and shouted 'Boom!' as Mr Sweeney crashed to the ground,

Prosecutor Michael Jones said: 'Grovell threw a gratuitous, forceful, unexpected and cowardly punch. Mr Sweeney's only involved was to act as a peacemaker and he was of no threat.'

He was seen smiling and 'bouncing like a boxer' before fleeing the scene in August this year.

Office worker Mr Sweeney died four days later from his injuries and father-of-one Grovell was arrested.

Grovell, who is an accounts worker, initially claimed he could not remember the attack but later admitted manslaughter.

Grovell, of Caerphilly, who appeared in court in a grey suit and glasses, was jailed for four years today.

Judge Eleri Rees told him: 'This was a cowardly act by you. Mr Sweeney didn't see the blow coming and had no chance to defend himself.
