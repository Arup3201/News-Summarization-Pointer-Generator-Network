A wealthy Texas woman who was injured during a hiking trip hired a private helicopter to come collect her - after state rescuers had been lugging her down the 8,000-foot mountain on a stretcher.

Nancy Allen, 48, called the Skamania County Sheriff's Office at about 8 p.m. on Tuesday to report that she and her daughter, Sara, 18, were stranded on Mt. St Helens in Washington State after she fell over a rocky outcropping and was unable to walk.

Multiple search and rescue teams rushed to help the women and, when they arrived, began carrying Allen down the mountain in a stokes litter, a basket-like stretcher. But it seems the rescuers' pace was 
too slow for the retired veterinarian, whose injuries
were not life-threatening, and at about 5:20 a.m. on Wednesday she called a private helicopter to get her the rest of the 
way down.

'I've never heard of this happening,' Under-sheriff Dave Cox told Oregonlive.com. 'I don't know how much it cost her, but I'm sure it was a spendy proposition. I know I wouldn't be able to afford it.'

The group was at 6,100 feet when Allen told the rescuers she'd had enough and was going to call a helicopter.

'She contacted them on her cellphone,' Cox said.

About an hour later, the chopper pilot arrived and picked up the two women. It appears the rescuers were left stranded on the mountain with their equipment.

When Allen initially called 911, she told sheriff's deputies that she and her daughter made it successfully to the top of Mt. St. Helens but on the way back down the mountain, they lost the trail.

That's when she stumbled, hurting herself, she said.

Unable to walk, the pair couldn't get back onto the trail and were forced to call for help.

The rescue team - it's unclear how many responded to the call - were using the stokes litter, a common tool in mountain rescues, to carry Allen down Mt. St Helens, until she opted for an upgrade.

It is unknown where the helicopter took Allen, how much the ride cost or what Allen's current condition is.
