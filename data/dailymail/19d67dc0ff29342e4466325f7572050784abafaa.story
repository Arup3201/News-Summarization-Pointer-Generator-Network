A trainee accountant says her £30,000 collection of ultra-realistic 'reborn dolls' has made it impossible for her to find a boyfriend.

Victoria Andrews, 22, from Newbury in Berkshire, has been obsessed with the dolls, each of which costs £800, since she was a teenager.

Miss Andrews, whose interest was first piqued when she stumbled across a website dedicated to the dolls at 16, has now amassed a collection worth £30,000 which includes 51 dolls, 100 outfits and several carrying baskets.

Passion: Victoria Andrews, 22, from Newbury, says she can't get a boyfriend because of her doll collection

'Sometimes I take one of them to work with me, where men find them scary,' she explained. 'Women seem not to mind so much.'

Not only do men find the dolls creepy, they have also proved a source of friction between Miss Andrews and her boyfriends - many of whom have complained about them. 

'The boyfriends I’ve had often complain about them,' she said. 'They hate it when I take them out with us - I think they find it all a bit creepy. My dolls give me all the fun of having kids but with no responsibility.'

Reborn dolls have become increasingly popular in recent years and are designed to resemble a human baby as closely as possible.

Few collectors, however, own as many as Miss Andrews. 'I always liked playing with dolls. I stumbled across reborn dolls online and I thought they were really cute.

Embarrassing: Miss Andrews says ex-boyfriends were cross when she took the dolls out in public

'The first one I bought was called Charlotte - I paid £250 for her. Once I had one I had to have more. They are adorable. It’s impossible not to love them.

'As an adult I’ve sacrificed my social life and love life for them - but I know they’re worth it.'

Miss Andrews, an accountancy student, funds her reborn doll collection by spending every evening working in a local pub.

The cheapest doll in her collection is worth £100. The most expensive doll, a blonde-haired and blue-eyed cherub named Chantelle, cost her £825.

'It’s a lot of money but, as far as I’m concerned, it’s money well spent,' said their owner. 'The dolls make me happy. 

'I get anxious when I’m not with them and I can’t wait to get home from work so I can relax with them.

'At the moment I have no plans to stop buying the dolls. But maybe in the future I’ll sell some of the more expensive ones to help me get together a deposit for a house.'

Miss Andrews lives at home with her parents to save on rent and buys all her clothes from charity shops.

She has sacrificed her social life, preferring to spend money on her dolls rather than going out to meet men.

'A night out could cost me up to £100 - I might as well stay at home and save my money to buy another doll,' she explained.

'I often stay home and brush their hair or change their outfits. Occasionally I will pick one up for a cuddle. It can be very comforting at the end of a hectic day.

'I usually bring one out and about with me when I run errands. I like to spend time with each one particularly if they are new and we’re still getting to know each other. Women love them but the men who see them often find them scary for some reason.'

But while women are impressed, her vast collection, which fills her bedroom shelves, has put off potential suitors.

Collection: As well as 51 dolls, Miss Andrews also owns 100 different outfits and several baby carriers

Undecided: Despite owning so many dolls, Miss Andrews says she hasn't decided if she wants real babies

'My first boyfriend was fine with them. He used to buy dolls for me and he would help me change their clothes.

'The next boyfriend I had kept moaning about them. He said I spent too much money on them. At the moment I’m single. 

'Whenever I meet a guy I try and warn them about the dolls. I usually drop it into the conversation as if it’s no big deal.'

Despite her obsession Miss Andrews said she does not want a real baby any time soon. 'I have a lot of kids in my family so I get to spend a lot of time with children - but I’m glad I get to give them back at the end of the day.

'I haven’t even decided if I want to have kids at all. I’m still young.'
