Stephen Colbert last night got his revenge on Mormons posthumously baptising Holocaust victims in a practice causing outrage among Jews.

The Catholic comedian gave his own take on the issue by ‘converting all dead Mormons to Judaism’ using a hot dog sausage and a cigar cutter.

His ‘proxy circumcision’ came after it was revealed Anne Frank has been posthumously baptised by a Mormon for the tenth time in 23 years.

Joke: Stephen Colbert gave his own take on the baptism issue by 'converting all dead Mormons to Judaism' using a hot dog sausage and a cigar-cutter

'Proxy circumcision' Mr Colbert said 600,000 dead Jews have now received
 posthumous baptisms from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints

Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel recently learned several of his relatives who died under the Nazis were posthumously baptised by Mormons.

But Mr Colbert, 47, told a Comedy Central audience that the 83-year-old author should not be so upset about a ‘name being on a list’.

He added that 600,000 dead Jews have now received posthumous baptisms from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

‘This controversy just seems like it will not die - and, if it did, the Mormons would posthumously baptise it,’ Mr Colbert said on his show.

He went on to invite his Jewish intern 
‘Jay’ onto the set to help him perform the ‘proxy circumcision’, 
reported the Los Angeles Times.

Mr Colbert claimed he was given the 
power to do this by renting Yentl, the 1983 Barbra Streisand film about a
 Jewish girl disguised as a boy.

‘Congratulations dead Mormons, you’re now dead Jews,’ he said. ‘I just pray that no one baptises you without your permission.’

The Mormon Church is coming under more scrutiny thanks to Broadway show The Book of Mormon and Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign.

Mr Romney helped baptise his staunch 
atheist relative Edward Roderick Davies, father of his wife Ann, years 
after the man had died in 1992.

Mr Wiesel told Mr Romney to renounce the practice of posthumously baptising Holocaust victims in the Mormon church last week.

Holocaust victim Anne Frank was 
posthumously baptised by a Mormon at a Dominican Republic temple last 
weekend for the first time in 13 years.

The
 Jewish girl and her diary rose to fame after she died during the World 
War Two Holocaust in 1945 at the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany.

survivor Simon Wiesenthal, right, who died in 2005, have both been 
victims of the scandal

Researcher Helen Radkey made the 
discovery after she found the same was done to the parents of Nazi 
hunter Simon Wiesenthal two weeks ago.

An agreement from 1995 required Mormons to avoid submitting names of Holocaust victims for baptism unless they are their direct ancestors.

But Anne, who died aged 15, was baptised by proxy an astonishing nine times between 1989 and 1999, Ms Radkey told the Huffington Post.

Mormons often perform the baptisms, saying people who died that did not get the chance to be baptised while living can choose to deny it.

A spokesman for the Mormon Church said it was ‘distressed’ by the finding on Anne and ‘keeps its word’ in not baptising Holocaust victims.
