Senators say Sgt Bowe Bergdahl did not ‘look good’ in proof-of-life video that they were shown at a meeting last night and may have been ‘drugged’ but did not appear to be near-death like the Obama administration claimed.

‘It appeared that he was drugged, and that he was barely responsive in the video itself,’ Senate Intelligence Vice-Chairman Saxby Chambliss, a Republican, told reporters on Wednesday.

‘I don’t think from a health standpoint there was any issue that dictated the release of these five nasty killers in exchange for Bergdahl,’ he added.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS

Tense: U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein talks to other Senators ahead of the meeting last night. Many came away feeling the video still did not justify ignoring Congress in making the trade

'Proof'?
 Sen. John McCain was among those shown the 1 1/2 minute long video - 
believed to have been filmed in December - at a briefing with Pentagon 
and intelligence officials at the U.S. Capitol last night

‘That did not sell me at all. The proof of life was basically five months ago. December? At that time he was impaired,’ Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin told ABC. ‘That is not the person that was released here. He was not in that type of dire situation when he was released.’

The terms of the trade for Bergdahl, coupled with stories from former platoon-mates of the soldier’s erratic behavior in the days leading up to his capture and remarks about wanting to desert the army, have had the Obama administration on defense since the president announced last Saturday that Bergdahl had been released.

Whatever the reason Bergdahl wandered off base alone, the U.S. has a commitment to rescue its men and women in uniform, the president and other administration officials have repeatedly said.

'I make absolutely no apologies for making sure that we get back a young man to his parents and that the American people understand that this is somebody’s child, and that we don’t condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back,' President Barack Obama said today during a press conference at the G7 Summit in Brussels.

And when the Taliban provided evidence that Bergdahl’s health was deteriorating, cabinet-level officials made a ‘unanimous’ decision to strike a deal, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said today.

‘It was our judgment based on the information that we had that his life, his health were in peril,’ Hagel told BBC in an interview that aired this morning.

However, a close friend of Bowe Bergdahl’s parents, Bob and Jani, told MailOnline that ‘Bob hasn’t said anything about Bowe’s health.

'Deserter':

Guantanamo put Americans at risk all around the world

‘There was never any doubt in Bob and Jani’s minds that Bowe was coming home, they have been the most resilient people I have ever met,’ said Chip Deffe, owner of the bike shop where Bob Bergdahl works. ‘But they have never mentioned any medical concerns.’

Members of the U.S. Senate were shown a classified 1 1/2 minute long video at a briefing with Pentagon and intelligence officials at the U.S. Capitol last night that was supposed to prove Bergdahl was deathly ill when the president and his cabinet decided to rescue him without consulting Congress.

But last night’s meeting did little to satisfy the concerns of the lawmakers, who say they still have unanswered questions about the trade.

‘There’s a lot to be answered here and there’s a lot of peculiar behavior that’s gone on between the family, this solider and his actions,’ Sen. Manchin said on Wednesday.

‘We all agree that we’re not dealing with a war hero,’ he said. ‘We’re dealing with a soldier who should be looked in more extensively.’

The executive branch is required to let members of Congress know 30 days in advance when it is going to release prisoners from the government’s detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

In this case, it gave lawmakers only hours notice or no notice at all that it was planning to release five detainees with ties to the Taliban.

‘I don’t see how anybody can walk out of there with any kind of comfortable feeling that the administration from a notification standpoint, and I emphasize that, did what they should have done or what they had the opportunity to do. I mean, it was like they didn’t trust Dianne [Feinstein] and me,’ Chambliss told Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren after the meeting.

All in: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel (pictured with with sailors aboard the USS Vella Gulf during his visit to Constanta today) said the White House had been unanimous in its decision to free Bergdahl

Chambliss told reporters earlier this week that he didn’t find out about the trade until it had already happened.

The White House has since apologized to Chambliss and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic, for failing to notify them of the swap in a timely manner, calling the mistake an ‘oversight.’

Chambliss said on Wednesday that it’s too little too late, though.

‘My comment back to the administration is that I’m not going to believe anything they tell me from now on,’ Chambliss said.

‘They are willing to violate the law but even short of that, when they commit to us that they are going to give us 30 days’ notice and then they don’t do it, how in the world can we trust the administration on anything they tell us?’

Senators from both parties said they are still worried that the Taliban associates released from prison by the White House are a threat to national security.

‘We have a 29 percent re-engagement rate from Guantanamo and I would argue that the conditions upon which these five detainees will be held is a real troubling aspect of this whole thing because four of them, at least, are very high-level members of the Taliban,’ New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, told ABC on Wednesday night.

‘These are all high-level people. This is not low level,’ Manchin said. ‘These are people who basically have the ability to go back and hit the ground running, and we’re concerned about that.’

In releasing ‘five of the most dangerous individuals in Guantanamo, if not the five most dangerous,’ Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said, ‘The president has now set a precedent that will encourage enemies of the United States to target American men and women in uniform, to capture them in order to carry out some other exchange in the future.’

Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, a Republican, admitted to Fox News that Bergdahl did not ‘look good’ in the classified video lawmakers were shown.

‘But there will be hell to pay if we find [the Taliban fighters] go on to kill Americans,’ he said.

The meeting came after a tumultuous day on Capitol
 Hill when Democrats joined the ranks of those expressing their anger 
over the swap. Senior Democrat congressman Dutch Ruppersberger said it 
was a 'dangerous precedent' that put the lives of Americans around the 
world at risk.

Putting on a brave face: Obama, pictured at the meeting of the G7 in Brussels overnight, has been taken aback by the level of discontent over the trade

The House is not in session this week, so lawmakers from the legislative branch’s other chamber have not yet had the opportunity to quiz administration officials.

Members of the House Armed Services Committee will have their shot at questioning Secretary of Defense Hagel at a hearing next week.
