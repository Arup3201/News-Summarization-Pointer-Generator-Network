A mother managed to implicate herself in a hit-and-run death when she asked police to kick her boyfriend out of her apartment, authorities said.

The call by Heather Lynn Mayo, 33, of Pinellas Park, Florida, backfired when her boyfriend told cops she was the driver in a February hit-and-run.

Robert Worden, 34, agreed to leave after Mayo told police she was afraid of him, but he implicated her in the crash that killed Jeannie Fisher, 50.

The boyfriend pointed out damage to a vehicle on Monday night matching the look of the one that hit Ms Fisher, reported the St Petersburg Times.

Police officers then interviewed Mayo. They say she confessed, was arrested and now faces charges of leaving the scene of a fatal crash.

Ms Fisher was walking across the street 
on February 4 - just three days before she turned 51 - when she was hit 
and died from her injuries.

Police only knew Ms Fisher was hit by a Ford pick-up truck that lost its side mirror and front turn signal, reported the St Petersburg Times.

They still knew nothing more until Worden got out of jail after serving 40 days for obtaining property with a worthless cheque.

He told police he was only there to see his seven-year-old daughter and agreed to leave, but on the way out showed them a 1997 Ford Ranger.

Worden alleged that Mayo had borrowed a neighbourâ€™s pick-up truck to drive somewhere and buy marijuana, later telling him she hit a deer.

But Mayo allegedly later confessed to him that she had hit a woman. She has since been booked into a jail and is being held in lieu of $52,250 bail.

Mother-of-one Ms Fisher was a waitress born in Indianapolis and raised in Indiana, Kentucky and South Africa, reported the St Petersburg Times.
