Portugal defender Fabio Coentrao has been ruled out of the remainder of the World Cup with a thigh injury.

The Real Madrid full-back pulled up sharply during the second half of Portugal's 4-0 defeat to Germany on Monday night and was replaced by Andre Almeida.

Coentrao underwent scans on the injury on Tuesday and the Portuguese football federation confirmed afterwards that the 26-year-old would play no further part in the tournament.

'It's a very sad moment for me, and one that I want to forget as quickly as possible,' Coentrao told the FPF.

'Of course, any player wants to take part in a competition like this.'

'I can't help the team or do anything for the team, the pre-season starts in one month so I have to think about getting better by then so I can help Real Madrid,' he added.

'On Sunday, we (Portugal) have another game against the United States and we have to face this game as if it were the last game of our lives.'

The FPF said Coentrao had suffered a second degree strain on the adductor muscle in his right thigh.

'Due
 to the severity of the injury, he will be unfit for competitive 
football for a period which extends beyond the duration of the World 
Cup,' it said in a statement

The 26-year-old is playing at his second World Cup and his place in the team is likely to be taken by Andre Almeida.

Hugo
 Almeida went off injured in the first half and was reported to have a 
grade one strain in his left thigh. Patricio, who played the whole game,
 all suffered a thigh strain.

'Hugo
 Almeida and Rui Patricio's injuries have the possibility of a clinical 
recovery during the competition, and they have started programmes of 
rehabilitation,' said the FPF.
