Bunny 'boiler': Tina Sandlin, 36, was strung out on meth when she was arrested for killing the family pet rabbit

A Florida woman who decapitated a pet bunny rabbit in front of her two children while strung out on meth will not go to prison.

Tina Sandlin, 36, pleaded no contest to animal cruelty and child abuse on Friday and has been sentenced to one year in an inpatient drug rehabilitation centre.

Bay County Sheriff's deputies arrested Sandlin last year after they found her holed up under a mobile home in Southport, Florida.

She went into hiding after she brought her children into her bedroom in mid-July so they could see her cut off the rabbit's head with a knife, according to NY Daily News.

The children later told police that their mother held the rabbit by the ears as it kicked its legs in a failed effort to free itself.

The kids did not immediately tell anyone about their pet's bloody death but eventually alerted their father.

Her husband told officers that Sandlin merely shrugged her shoulders and said she slaughtered the pet because she was bored, when he confronted her.

He added that their children, now 7 and 4, had nightmares about the incident.

Sandlin left the house and did not contact her family for about a month. Officers say she admitted to the killing after they took her into custody.

Judge Elijah Smiley sentenced her to five years' probation, including 18 months on drug offender probation.

Her probation may be terminated after 30 months if she meets a set of requirements.

Sandlin is forbidden from contacting her husband or children while in the facility.

She may be able to have contact with the kids again after being leaving rehab and remaining sober for 90 days, said the Daily News.

But the children's counselor will establish the terms of the visitation.

Linda, Austin - I agree but if prison life wasn't as tolerable I really think that it would be a deterrent.  Why should they sit around all day, watch TV, sleep on a bed, and get three meals prepared a day.  Make it hot or cold, hard labor and basic food. And wood bunks.  I truly believe many people would stay above the law once released.

In prison, this woman would only get worse AND she'd cost the state a whole lot of money, eventually to get out and re-offend.  She might get better if she stays on the track the judge set forth.  Meth creates monsters.  P.S. Where does it say in the story that this woman was on "welfare"?  P.P.S. Rich people and middle class people are just as capable of cruel and heinous behavior as is someone on "welfare".

Sounds like the judge tried to get her help.

Another strung out drug addict welfare queen.

I feel badly for the children who have to live with this as their "mother" and the memories of what she did.

She is the picture of good health. Thank heavens the democrats are outlawing cigarette smoking and legalizing street drugs such as pot. You have to love the world's liberals (i.e. idiots) they have .proof that no rules or personal responsibilities are the path to prosperity and a great life,

Not really a prison crime anyway is it.
