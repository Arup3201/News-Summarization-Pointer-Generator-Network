QPR midfielder Leroy Fer will be sidelined for up to ten weeks after suffering a medial collateral ligament injury in his side's win at Sunderland on Tuesday night.

The 25-year-old, who scored the opener against the Black Cats, was forced from the fray on a stretcher  in the 75th minute at the Stadium of Light.

The injury came as a result of a challenge between Fer and Sunderland midfielder Liam Bridcutt, with the former Norwich man immediately clutching his left knee in agony.
