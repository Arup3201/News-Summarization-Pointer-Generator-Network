Guilty: Lavinia Desuze was convicted 
of perverting the course of justice after she shredded the 
top her 16-year-old son was wearing 
when he attacked 68-year-old Richard Mannington Bowes

The mother of a teenage thug who killed a pensioner in last summer’s riots is facing jail after she destroyed his clothes in a bid to cover his tracks.

Lavinia Desuze, 31, was today convicted of perverting the course of justice after she shredded the distinctive ‘Robbers and Villains’ top her 16-year-old son was wearing when he attacked 68-year-old Richard Mannington Bowes.

The pensioner was trying to put out a fire near his home in Ealing, west London, when he was punched with such force by looter Darrell Desuze that he fractured his skull on the pavement.

He died three days later in hospital.

But unlike other horrified parents, who 'turned in their own children' after seeing their faces broadcast on TV, Darrell’s mother cut up the top he was wearing after spotting it during a televised appeal for help in finding the killer.

She then cycled a mile from her Hounslow home in the dead of night to dump the top, an Adidas bag and white T-shirt in two separate bins in a bid to evade police.

A jury of six men and six women took just 20 minutes to convict her of perverting the course of justice following a three-day trial at Inner London Crown Court.

She will be sentenced on April 17 with her son Darrell, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter, burglary and violent disorder earlier this month.

The Honourable Mr Justice Saunders, sitting at Inner London Crown Court, granted the 31-year-old mother bail until next month but warned she faces a prison sentence.

He said: 'I don’t want you to be under any misapprehension. The fact that I have adjourned this case for pre-sentence reports does not in any way mean that it will not conclude with a custodial sentence. It is a very serious matter.'

The brutal attack on Mr Mannington 
Bowes shocked the nation and a photograph of his unconscious body became
one of the defining images of last summer’s riots.

Darrell, whose street name is Smokey, went on to loot several shops after he attacked the pensioner.

During the trial, prosecutor Brian 
Altman QC told jurors his mother had destroyed the clothing in a 
deliberate attempt to help him evade justice.

'The prosecution say there was only 
one reason why she did what she did. She realised the distinctive 
articles of clothing would lead to not only to her son’s identification 
but also to him facing justice for what he had done,' he said.

Having destroyed the clothing, the 
mother later admitted her actions to police, even leading officers to 
the bins where she had disposed of the bags but they had been already 
been emptied when they arrived.

The jury had heard how prior 
to her and her son’s arrest a 22-year-old man had been detained by 
police on suspicion of Mr Bowe’s murder after being wrongly identified 
on the CCTV.

When the 
Met arrived at her home in Hounslow, west London, she is alleged to have
said: 'You’ve got the bloke that did it. Why are you here for my son?'

Ms
Desuze admitted her son had been in Ealing that night but claimed he 
had tried to help Mr Bowes, allegedly saying: 'He was there when he was 
punched. My son helped that man. He put him in the recovery position.'

When she was arrested by officers, the 31-year-old answered ‘no comment’ in interview.

But in a later outburst in a police 
car she blamed police for Mr Mannington Bowes death by sparking off the 
riots with the shooting of Mark Duggan, saying: 'Police can kill someone
and get away with it. But a man died after being attacked in the riots,
not murder, and the whole force is out,” the jury was told.

Giving evidence during the trial, she
denied trying to pervert justice and claimed that she had destroyed his
clothes to protect him from angry looting victims.

She told jurors she had heard that a 
man had been charged with the killing and was concerned for her son’s 
safety if he wore the clothing.

She said: “I didn’t want my son 
attacked by anyone who suffered from the riots or had sentimental 
feelings about them because I myself was affected by the riots.

'He definitely would have been in danger - he was 16 years old and in a vulnerable situation.'

Asked by Mr Altman QC if the ‘real 
truth’ was that ‘you knew the police were after your son and that they 
had gotten the wrong man,’ she replied: 'I couldn’t have known that.'

Summing up the case, Mr Justice 
Saunders told the jury they would have to decide why she did not give 
the same account to police when they arrested her.

'If you reach the conclusion that she
didn’t mention it at the time because she hadn’t invented it by then - 
as the prosecution say it was an invented explanation - that means that 
you have to carry on to conclude that it wasn’t true,' he said.

There was a stand-off between police and
rioters on Spring Bridge Road in Ealing at the time of the tragedy and 
around 70 youths were lobbing missiles at officers.

As Mr Mannington Bowes remonstrated with
the group and tried to stamp out a fire in a bin Desuze punched 
him in the face and he fell smashing his head on the pavement.

Mr
Altman added: 'Because of her actions this defendant is charged with 
perverting the course of justice by concealing or destroying her son’s 
clothing, the Robbers and Villains top, the patterned white T-shirt and 
the distinctive Adidas bag, items which, say the prosecution, she knew 
would rightly point the finger of guilt at her son.

'She
knew he had been in Ealing. She knew he had been involved in killing Mr
Bowes so in order to prevent any link with this crime she got rid of it
all for one reason and one reason only, to obstruct the course of 
justice.'
