The first woman to captain a Royal Navy warship could be facing the sack over claims she had an affair with a male subordinate.

Commander Sarah West, 42, has been flown back to the UK in disgrace following the claims of a sexual relationship with a member of her crew on HMS Portland.

And as an intense military investigation is launched into Cdr West’s conduct, the former head of the Navy said that if the claims were true, the trailblazing commander would have let down all female officers – and provided fuel for those who argue against women being on active service.

Admiral Lord West, who is not related to the captain, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The rules are very clear and if she has had a relationship with someone under her command then she’s rather let down other women in the Royal Navy, because there are people who will jump on this and  say this is why women shouldn’t be on ship – which is total nonsense.’

Cdr West, who is divorced from a Navy helicopter pilot, is the first woman to command a frontline warship in the Navy’s 500-year history. Her 5,000-ton Type 23 frigate was conducting anti-narcotics patrols  in the Caribbean when the claims of misconduct emerged, and she was flown back to Britain.

Navy sources said she had left HMS Portland for ‘personal reasons’ and is now on annual leave.

Meanwhile the frigate is sailing back to Britain and is expected to dock in Plymouth this week, having left San Juan, Puerto Rico, on July 19. The ship’s officers and crew are being questioned by military investigators over the alleged affair.

Cdr West, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, is alleged to have broken strict Royal Navy rules that forbid any relationships which could undermine trust or the ship’s operational effectiveness. If the claims are proven, she could face a formal warning, reassignment or even termination of her service.

The male officer, whose identity is unknown, may also face disciplinary action. Last night the Ministry of Defence refused to disclose whether he has retained his responsibilities aboard HMS Portland or if he, too, has been removed from the ship.

In Cdr West’s absence her deputy, Lieutenant Commander Rob Brann, has taken charge.

Last night Lord West added: ‘This incident is very sad. If the allegations are true I doubt Commander West will continue in her post or  be given another ship to command. There are so many excellent officers coming through that she won’t get the chance.

‘Without any doubt, women must continue to lead in the Royal Navy as they have proved themselves  in an array of demanding jobs. The truth is we wouldn’t have enough sailors in the Royal Navy if you removed the women. They are a key part of what we do.

‘There were not any women aboard when I was commanding ships but  I was aware of men having sex with each other and they were disciplined. Indeed, early in my career  it was illegal.

‘As ship’s captain you must set  an example through your conduct and be beyond reproach. The  rules banning relationships in the chain of command exist for a very good reason.’

In the past, Cdr West has revealed how being at sea has made it difficult to maintain a relationship. She married pilot Andrew Whitlum in 1998 but they later separated.

In a newspaper interview, she said: ‘Lots of women in the services  have challenging roles. There are drawbacks, though. Years at sea probably explains why I’m single. But every person in the military makes sacrifices.’

She became a commander in January 2012 and assumed command of HMS Portland in May that year.

The frigate sailed from Plymouth in January this year on a seven-month deployment to promote UK interests in Europe, Africa, South and North America. The warship visited the Falkland Islands in early June before sailing north.

On June 30, Cdr West joined Foreign Office Minister Hugo Swire at a reception in Cartagena, Colombia, to mark Armed Forces Day.

On July 10, the Royal Navy released a photograph on HMS Portland’s Twitter account of Cdr West standing on the deck of her ship surrounded by all her crew. Allegations of her affair are believed to have surfaced just days later, and according to Naval sources she left the vessel in ‘mid-July’.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night: ‘We are aware of an allegation of a breach of the Code  of Social Conduct on board HMS Portland, which we are treating seriously. Anyone who is found to fall short of the Royal Navy’s high standards can expect to face appropriate action. It would be inappropriate  to comment further.’
