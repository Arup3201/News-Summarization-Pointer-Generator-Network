An ex-General Electric employee from New York has been indicted on federal charges of plotting to use a weapon of mass destruction.

Glendon Scott Crawford, 49, was arrested with Eric Feight, 54, in June after the FBI alleged the pair tried to sell a homemade weapon of mass destruction to Jewish groups and a branch of the KKK.

The men are accused of trying to create a remote controlled weapon that would emit radioactive waves that would cause those around the device to die from radiation poisoning within days.

Charges: Glendon Crawford, seen at an Albany court last year, has been indicted for conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction

Lethal: The alleged plot involved remotely firing a death ray that would kill victims with radiation poisoning

On Thursday a federal grand jury charged Crawford was attempting to produce and use a radiological device, conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, and distribution of information relating to weapons of mass destruction.Â 

Crawford's role was to design and build the radiation device and its power supply, according to a federal complaint.

Crawford allegedly planned to turn an industrial-grade X-ray machine into a remote-controlled laser gun.

The laser gun would be mounted in a truck and driven to an area near the intended victims.

After
 parking the truck, the driver would leave the scene and activate the 
laser via a remote control from about half a mile away.

Everyone near the truck would receive a lethal dose of radiation and die within two weeks of the attack.

The FBI says the device would have worked if it had been completed.

The remote controlled aspect of the 
device had been tested, but a radiation source had not been secured, 
according to the FBI report seen by the Times Union.

The
 FBI started investigating Crawford in April 2012, after he allegedly 
approached Schenectady's Congregation Gates of Heaven synagogue.

He allegedly 'asked to speak
 with a person who might be willing to help him with a type of 
technology that could be used by Israel to defeat its enemies, 
specifically, by killing Israel's enemies while they slept'.

The same day, the married industrial mechanic allegedly called an Albany Jewish group to make a similar offer.

An official at the synagogue contacted police, who informed the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force.

Crawford
 and Feight were arrested in June after the FBI used undercover 
informants posing as members of a KKK group who were interested in funding the 
weapon.

Crawford had allegedly approached a senior member of a KKK group to ask for funding. The contact had then informed the FBI.

The alleged weapon had not been finished, but the FBI report said the pair planned to hide the converted X-ray system in a truck, according to ABC News. The device would have been detonated using the vehicle's cigarette lighter, the report claimed.

Feight, who was allegedly going to design and build the remote-controlled detonator, has not been indicted, but is under a federal complaint.
