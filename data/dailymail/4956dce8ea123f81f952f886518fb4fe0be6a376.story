James Richardson, a former spokesman for the GOP, has come out as gay and hopes to legalise same-sex marriage

A former spokesman for the Republican Party and senior GOP candidates has come out as gay and says he wants his party to legalize gay marriage.

James Richardson, from Georgia, has worked for the likes of Jon Huntsman and Haley Barbour and at one time served as communications manager for the Republican National Committee.

He has previously campaigned for legal same-sex marriage, but now he has come out as gay, he hopes his example will be enough to help persuade other Republicans to change their minds.

Writing in the Washington Post, he said: 'My partner and I are envious subscribers to the conventional, conservative family model. 

'Yet together, as two men wishing to grow grey and ornery in matching rocking chairs, we are consigned to 'cohabitation' as a consequence of law. That's unjust, and it's uniquely painful.'

Richardson argues that, since straight couples are abandoning marriage, the inclusion of gay people will only serve to strengthen the institution.

Richardson said that coming out will hopefully make his argument more persuasive, adding: 'It brings some personal heft when you are convincing people that what they are doing is going to hurt you.' 

There are currently six openly gay members of the U.S. House, and one member of the Senate, all of whom are Democrats.

However three gay Republican candidates are running in the November elections - Richard Tisei of Massachusetts, Carl DeMaio of California and Dan Innis of New Hampshire. 

Richardson's new confession puts him at direct odds with former employer Hayley Barbour, who is strongly opposed to same sex marriage.

Mr Richardson worked with Jon Huntsman (pictured) on his presidential campaign. Mr Huntsman has also embraced the policy of allowing same-sex marriage

Despite that, Richardson says he respects her position while 'strongly disagreeing' with it.

In his article, he admits that he will probably lose friends now that he has come out, and may be viewed as a 'liability' by conservative clients, but says the sacrifice will be worth it if he converts even one person to his way of thinking. 

As well as working as a spokesman for high-profile Presidential candidates, Richardson has also written opinion pieces for various newspapers and websites.

He now works as the vice president of Hynes Communications after considering a White House bid of his own, and attends an evangelical church.
