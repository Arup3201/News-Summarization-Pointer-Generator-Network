A New Yorker has entered the Guinness Book of Records after collecting 750 pizza boxes from around the world. 

Scott Weiner is so obsessed by his favourite dinner that he is a professional pizza tour guide, taking visitors to New York to interesting and unusual restaurants.

As part of his quest, Weiner has collected boxes from 45 different countries over the past 15 years. One of his boxes was signed by tattoo artist Ed Hardy. 

The 32-year-old from Brooklyn developed his strange addiction while touring with his band.

 As well as 'Scott's Pizza Tours', Weiner has written a book on the history of Pizza boxes. 

I bet you can't top that - a man has spent a whole lot of dough after amassing the World's biggest pizza box collection.

Pizza fan, Scott Weiner, 32, has spent around 15 years building up his collection and now owns more than 750 boxes including some of the rarest boxes from around the world.

Weiner stores his collection in a cupboard inside his Brooklyn, some of which are from Brazil, Italy, Israel and India. 

He found one box featuring the Simpsons inside an Amsterdam bin. 

He also paid $200 for a 54 square inch box with is understood to be the world's largest.

Weiner's achievement has been recognised by Guinness World Records who gave him a certificate 

He said: ' I started collecting physical boxes in 2009, my first box was a Roma Foods "Tour of Italy" series Volume 3: Florence.

'I never thought there would be so much variation until I saw a yellow and blue box in Israel, boxes in New York and New Jersey are white with red printing and the Israeli box was just so completely different I was intrigued.

'It was when I saw that there was a series of boxes from a food distributor, I knew it was something possible to collect.

'I was exposed to different pizzerias while on tour with my band in the early 2000s, when I came home to New Jersey I would take my friends to different pizzerias and tell them about the ovens and their history.

'I've got lots of great boxes, some from Brazil transform into toys like puzzles and model airplanes, while most of them are rare because they're printed then they become garbage.

Weiner said he is planning to travel to London, England, for a special exhibition featuring his best pizza boxes

'One is a limited edition box from a place in Niagara Falls, it was their 50th anniversary box and the owner mailed me one and I have another that is signed by Ed Hardy, the tattoo artist, who designed the art on the box.

'I even have one from India that is newer but it has amazing steam vents so that the pizza won't get soggy.

'But I adore one unlicensed Simpsons box because it's rare and I remember squealing when I found it in Amsterdam in 2012, I'll never forget that moment.

'I eat pizza everyday but I cap myself at 15 slices per week in an effort to prevent pizza burnout.

'Surprisingly, I haven't been able to find anyone who collects pizza boxes besides people in the business and even those folks don't keep too many.

'People are shocked at first and don't understand how pizza boxes can be something to collect but then I show them a few photos and they are hooked.

'I published a book about them in November and that's really helping turn the tide and boost pizza box art, the book has become a great source of legitimacy for the collection and I'm even bringing an exhibition of 100 boxes to London this autumn. '
