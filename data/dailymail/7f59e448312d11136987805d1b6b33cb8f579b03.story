Oscar Pistorius walked free from court yesterday, with legal experts predicting he won’t spend a day behind bars.

The sprinter was found guilty of culpable homicide in the shooting death of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, but South African legal academics say a jail sentence is unlikely, and a Paralympic official confirmed he would be allowed to resume his lucrative career.

Double-amputee Pistorius, 27, left the Pretoria High Court as a convicted killer – although crucially not a murderer – and must wait until October 13 for sentencing. Culpable homicide, or manslaughter as it is known in Britain, carries a maximum sentence of 15 years, but no minimum.

Judge Thokozile Masipa is a keen advocate of leniency towards first- time offenders.

Media scrum: Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorius leaves Pretoria High Court yesterday after being found guilty of manslaughter

Criminal law expert Martin Hood said: ‘He is almost certainly, in my opinion, not going to jail.’ Legal academic Stephen Tuson added: ‘It could even be the imposition of a fine or community service, or house arrest.’

Miss Steenkamp’s mother, June, 67, said the family was ‘shocked and disappointed’ by the verdict.

‘It doesn’t add up,’ she said. ‘This verdict is not justice for Reeva. I just want the truth. I can’t believe that they believe it was an accident.

‘She died a horrible death. A horrible, painful, terrible death. They believe his story, and I don’t believe that story – that’s the difference.’

Her husband Barry, 71, who suffered a stroke after Reeva’s death, said: ‘I was terrified I wouldn’t make it.’

He added: ‘All we wanted was the truth. Now he must suffer the consequences. I don’t think he ever said sorry. You hold your child as a baby in your arms and you say, “I promise no harm will ever come to you”. And you feel guilty that you never kept your word.’

As Pistorius stood to hear the judge clear him of murdering Miss Steenkamp, 29, in February last year but find him guilty of manslaughter, he betrayed none of the emotion he had shown to the court during his six-month trial.

Loud sobs could be heard, however, only feet away as the dead model’s friend Gina Myers shook her head and wept.

Barry Steenkamp slapped his leg and grimaced, occasionally snatching a glance at the man who had taken his daughter’s life.

The Steenkamp family were desperately hoping their daughter’s killer would be jailed for the maximum life sentence.

During the lengthy court case, they heard that she had written a hauntingly prophetic note a few weeks before she was killed.

After Pistorius and Miss Steenkamp left a party on bad terms, she texted him to say: ‘I’m scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me and of how you will react to me.’

Such testy exchanges were common between the pair after they started dating in December 2012, less than three months before Miss Steenkamp’s violent death.

Victim: Oscar Pistorius's girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp

The arguments mainly stemmed from the athlete’s insecurity and jealously, and his love of firearms.

In truth, there are many dark secrets in the life of Oscar Pistorius, a man with a volcanic temper and a near-pathological obsession with weapons.

There are many in South Africa – and throughout the world – who believe Pistorius still refuses to take responsibility for Miss Steenkamp’s violent death. And that yesterday’s verdict has allowed him to escape justice.

After the verdicts, Arnold, the patriarch of the large Pistorius family, expressed his ‘deep gratitude’ to the judge for acquitting the sprinter of murder, adding, ‘there are no victors in this’.

He spoke of the ‘big burden that is now off our shoulders’.

Prosecutors expressed their disappointment at the court’s findings, but said they would wait until after the runner’s sentencing hearing before deciding whether to launch an appeal.

In a failed application to have the athlete’s bail revoked, prosecutor Gerrie Nel – apparently stung by Judge Masipa’s comments that he failed to make the case for murder – presumed ‘a lengthy sentence’ for Pistorius, citing a recent nightclub scuffle, the fact that he was ‘a flight risk’ and the double amputee’s suicidal feelings as compelling reasons to remand him in custody.

Even if he is jailed, Pistorius could still be in his early 30s when he is free to pick up the pieces of his once-glittering career.

And the International Paralympic Committee yesterday indicated it was an achievable goal.

In an interview that was seen by some as insensitive in both its timing and the language used, IPC spokesman Craig Spence described the convicted killer as ‘an inspiration to millions’ who would be free ‘to compete again in the future’. He told Radio 5 Live: ‘If he wishes to resume his athletics career, then we wouldn’t step in his way – we would allow him to compete again in the future.’

Whether Pistorius would be welcomed back by his fellow athletes is another question. Athletes and coaches who know him speak of a multi-millionaire whose life had been spiralling dangerously out of control for months before he killed Miss Steenkamp.

‘One minute he can be an angel, then dark the next,’ one athlete said. ‘He can get very bleak and angry. He’s used to getting what he wants. There are different Oscars – a kind, polite Oscar, and a really nasty one. There is no point trying to calm down the really nasty Oscar. That Oscar is, frankly, a lunatic.’

If Pistorius is jailed, he is expected to serve his sentence at the 107-year-old Kgosi Mumpuru Management Centre, formerly known as Pretoria central prison, an institution where gang violence is rife and prisoners spend 23 hours a day in horrendously overcrowded cells.

His lawyers hope to persuade the prison management to allow Pistorius to use his prosthetic legs, but sources suggest they will be removed because they could be used as a weapon. Instead, he is likely to be offered a wheelchair and will be housed in a wing with other disabled prisoners.

Yet among those who knew Pistorius, few extend him any sympathy. ‘I hope he gets the worst of the worst of what’s on offer in our prisons,’ one said yesterday.

‘He’s not a hero – he’s a violent killer and a coward. The world should curse every mention of his name.’
