The tangled history of a man who claims he's too fat to work - including his five former wives and bizarre bid to take over a football club - was revealed today.

Steve Beer shocked the nation on Monday when he appeared on TV boasting how the £1,700-a-week handouts he and latest wife, Michelle, receive covered the cost of their taxpayer-funded wedding.

But it emerged today that the 31-stone benefits claimant has twice appeared on Jeremy Kyle and is hated by two of his ex-wives and children.

The family of Stephen Beer - who appeared with latest wife Michelle Coombe on a Channel 5 documentary earlier this week - have revealed the emotional trail of destruction he has left behind him

Mr Beer, pictured with latest wife Michelle, has been slammed by his second wife, Alison Symons, and her children  for his treatment of them

Mr Beer, of Plymouth, Devon, married his second wife, Alison Symons, in 1989, having split from first partner, Eileen Mitchell.

But he and Ms Symons separated three years later, leaving her with their two children, Sarah and Matty, who were then both less than two years old.

Both of his children, who are now in their twenties, today told The Sun they are 'ashamed' of their biological father's benefits-funded lifestyle and treat Mrs Symons' new partner, Steve Symons, as their real father.

In March 2009, Mr Beer, who then ran a contract cleaning firm, was involved in a botched bid to take over non-league Weymouth FC.

He had hoped to save the then-financially embattled south coast club, but pulled out of a planned deal at the last minute after getting 'cold feet' and suffering a minor stroke.

The club's director Ian Winsor said at the time: 'Mr Beer clearly got cold feet. He did have a bit of money and being a major football fan he thought he could help the club.

'However, he has spent too long in Weymouth and, through speaking to people, heard so much bitterness he got scared.'

One of the club's players later commented that a meeting with Mr Beer seemed to be the first time the 'prospective owner' had eaten in a restaurant, as he asked for explanations of dishes on the menu.

At one pointed in the doomed deal, Mr Beer reportedly produced a cheque for £300,000 that contained spelling mistakes and had Tipp-Ex marks on it.

After marriages to a woman believed to have since died and a common-law wife called Fiona Burt, Mr Beer wedded his fifth wife Lynn Kirby in 2001.

He was filmed by the makers of Benefits: Too Fat To Work, a Channel 5 documentary about benefit claimants who claim their weight prevents them from working, which was aired earlier this week

The pair were married for ten years but split after Ms Kirby suspected her husband of cheating on her with his current wife, Michelle.

She told The Sun's Mike Ridley today that she worked to support him while he 'sat on his fat behind'.

She added: 'I don't think he will ever lose weight - he will keep eating and eating.' 

It is believed Mr Beer has made two emotionally-charged appearances on the Jeremy Kyle show. The first was in 2011, when he made an appearance in a segment entitled: 'I'm your husband's mistress and I'll prove I'm not cheating on him.'

He reportedly admitted he failed a lie detector test regarding his affair and at times shouted at host Jeremy Kyle, repeating that 'we all make mistakes'. 

Mr Beer's son said he and his biological father appeared on the show last year, when a paternity test proved he was his father. But, his son said, 'he still didn't want anything to do with me'.

The revelations came after Mr Beer, 45, caused outrage this week when he appeared on Channel 5 documentary Benefits: Too Fat To Work, in which he told of his £3,000 taxpayer-funded wedding to Michelle, 43.

Mr Beer can't stand up for more than a few minutes at a time and relies on a council carer to get washed

The couple's big day – which saw £1,000 spent on catering, including £450 for their favourite kebab takeaway for the evening buffet – was paid for almost entirely from benefits. 

Mr Beer, who  weighs 31st, had to have a suit specially made for the occasion.

By contrast his 23st wife became a bride for the first time and wore a white gown for the register office ceremony and church blessing that followed. Their 50 guests were treated to a three-course meal at the reception, followed later by the buffet. 

Viewers were shown how paramedics were called to the reception in Plymouth, Devon, before Mr Beer was taken to hospital feeling unwell.

Mr Beer, who suffers from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and other problems linked to his weight, had a blood clot on the lung and instead of a honeymoon he spent nine days in hospital. 

He can only stand for a limited period before becoming breathless and his wife said the wedding day trip to hospital was no surprise. Mrs Beer, who has not had a job during her adult life, said: 'I reckon Stephen will be on benefits for most of his life.'

Mr Beer used to run a cleaning business and had to give up work six years ago following a stroke.

Producers followed them as they organised the ceremony - including canapes and a buffet provided by their favourite kebab shop

Despite being jobless and on a weight management course, the couple can be seen treating themselves to kebabs after they went to a weigh in and realised they had lost a few pounds. The takeaway cost almost £12

Interviewed about his benefits on the documentary, he said: 'Is it right? Of course not. But at the end of the day I did work. I have worked, I haven't sat on my a*** all the time. I have done some work and so really, why not?' 

The couple receive around £1,700 a month in benefits. The rent on their one-bedroom flat is paid for by the taxpayer, and a carer comes twice daily to clean and help Mr Beer dress, but the taxpayer pays the £8,000-a-year cost.

Mr Beer also uses a specially strengthened mobility scooter, provided at public expense.

He insists he wants a job but says no one will give him work because of his weight. He blamed the Government for being too generous to those on benefits.

Speaking on ITV's This Morning programme, Mr Beer said: 'The Government is making it easy for people like us. The Government is making it easy for people on benefits.'

He said he didn't think he deserved anything, adding: 'I'm the one who put myself in this situation, no one else.' However, he insisted he was now suffering from 'prejudice'. He said he recently applied for an office job but claims he was turned down because he was too overweight.

It is believed the couple are currently at a 'boot camp' to lose weight. 

He also told host Phillip Schofield that he did not always eat kebabs, and that off camera he and his wife were eating 'healthy food'
