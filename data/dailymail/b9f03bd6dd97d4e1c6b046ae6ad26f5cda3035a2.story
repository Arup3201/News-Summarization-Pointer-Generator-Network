Tensions between Japan and China sparked by a row over a group of disputed islands have deepened after a flotilla of boats carrying Japanese activists sailed in nearby waters.

The Chinese foreign ministry has said that it has lodged 'stern representations' with Japan after 10 boats carrying 80 activists was seen close to the islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea.

Eight Chinese government ships are also said to have sailed in the vicinity of the islands.

Tense: Relations between the two countries were damaged further when China reacted with anger after politicians and lawmakers paid a visit to a Japanese war memorial which honours 14 war criminals

Japan's tetchy relationship with its neighbour was also further tested after China chastised after around 170 Japanese lawmakers visited a shrine to the country's war dead.

The Yasukuni Shrine - which pays homage to 14 leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal - is seen as a symbol of Japan's militarism by both China and South Korea.

The pilgrimage came after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made an offering and Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso and two other ministers visited the shrine over the weekend.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said in a news conference:'Regarding the Japanese right-wing activists' illegal entry into the waters of the Diaoyu islands that is causing trouble, the Chinese foreign ministry has lodged stern representations with Japan, and has strongly protested.

Japan's tetchy relationship 
with its neighbour was also further tested after China chastised after 
around 170 Japanese lawmakers visited a shrine to the country's war 
dead.

'Regardless of what method or what 
identity these Japanese leaders take in visiting Yasukuni Shrine, 
fundamentally it is intentionally denying Japan's militaristic 
invasionist history.'

'We
 urge Japan to be responsible to history, to be responsible to the 
people and take a responsible attitude to the future and take realistic 
actions to win the trust of the international community, stop causing 
harm to itself and stop isolationist measures.'

While
 Chinese officials sternly warned Japan about the nationalist's activity
 close to the disputed islands, Japan itself protested at what it called
 an intrusion by eight Chinese patrol vessels into its waters near the 
uninhabited islands, which are near rich fishing grounds and potentially
 lucrative maritime gas fields.

But Tokyo appeared keen to avoid a clash between the nationalists' flotilla and the Chinese ships.

Protests: Japan's purchase of the islands was met by fierce protests in China last year

Japan's Coast Guard, which had 13 vessels shadowing the boats, urged them to leave and escorted them away.

Last
 year members of the same group, known as 'Ganbare Nippon' (Stand Firm! 
Japan), landed on one of the rocky islets and triggered anti-Japanese 
protests in China, where lingering resentment over Japan's wartime 
aggression has been rekindled.

Some
 Japanese experts said that, despite the latest tensions, the Asian 
rivals might avoid a re-run of the violent protests last September that 
hurt economic ties between the two countries.

Those protests were sparked when Japan's government bought the islands from a private owner.

Meanwhile,
 South Korea, where bitter memories of Japan's 1910-1945 colonisation 
run deep, has cancelled a trip to Japan by its foreign minister 
following the weekend visits to the Yasukuni shrine.

South
 Korean foreign ministry spokesman Cho Tae-young said matters of history
 should be kept separate from efforts to cooperate over North Korea's 
nuclear ambitions.

He 
said: 'It is helpful that the region's countries and the international 
community work together and pool their wisdom to solve this problem (of 
North Korea).

'But when it comes to history issues like the Yasukuni visit, our government takes a firm stance. That must not be mixed.'

But conservatives in Japan argue they should be able to pay their respects to the nation's war dead in their own way.

Remembrance: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe gave an offering to a Japanese war shrine over the weekend

Hidehisa
 Otsuji, a ruling Liberal Democrat Party lawmaker said: 'It is natural 
for lawmakers to worship at a shrine for people who died for the nation 
and every nation does this. I don't understand why we get a backlash.'

The
 group of lawmakers typically visits the shrine during its annual spring
 and autumn festivals, although the delegation was unusually large this 
year.

Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso shrugged off overseas anger over the visits.

He said: 'I first visited Yasukuni on April 28, 1953 and often went there ever since.

'I go there two or three times every year and it's not something that should be taken up now. There's a reaction from overseas?

'But that's their reaction and I don't think it will much affect Japan's diplomatic relations with other countries.'

Abe
 has enjoyed sky-high popularity ratings of more than 70 percent since 
he took office in December and launched his 'Abenomics' plan to boost 
growth and beat deflation with hyper-easy monetary policy, spending and 
structural reform.

The 
prime minister, who has said he regretted not visiting Yasukuni during 
his 2006-2007 term in office, has been walking a fine line between 
talking tough in the territorial row with China and leaving the door 
open for dialogue.

Voters
 want Abe to put priority on fixing the economy rather than other issues
 close to his heart, such as revising Japan's pacifist constitution, an 
opinion poll showed this week.
