Reverend Wayne Dulson has outraged neighbours after having bodies exhumed to make way for his new family home next to Loughton Baptist Church

A vicar has outraged neighbours after having bodies exhumed to make way for his new family home next to the church.

Residents, including children, watched as bones from resting places pre-dating 1860 were dug up and transferred to coffins before being taken away.

They say they are disgusted at the Reverend Wayne Dulson and Loughton Baptist Church’s lack of sensitivity over the matter and claim the move is motivated by money.

The locals claim a perfectly good four-bedroom manse not far from the Essex church was sold last year for £630,000 to fund the project and the new one could be worth over £1million when complete.

Underwriter Colin Hart, 50, whose family home backs on to the church, said: ‘I’m disgusted that a supposed man of the cloth should go round digging up bodies from their final place of rest. Local people have entrusted their loved ones to this church and this is how they behave.’

His wife, Julie, 48, added: ‘Whatever happened to rest in peace? We woke up to the sound of a JCB out the back and you could see them loading coffins from the back garden.’

Mother-of-four Simone Cohen, 52, said: ‘What I found most upsetting was that when they transferred the bones into coffins, the children could see everything.’

The row began after the church was given permission to develop the site. Epping Forest Council approved an extension for a playgroup at the church but turned down plans for the house because it was not in keeping with the area. This, however, was overturned on appeal to the planning inspectorate.

Neighbours were woken at 5am in October 2013 by the sound of workmen and a JCB which spent two weeks removing 25 bodies, including women buried with children, to make way for the nursery. An exhumation licence had been granted by the Ministry of Justice and the project was completed in spring. Work began on the house but it was suspended after more bodies were found and another licence sought.

Mr Dulson, a married father, has declined to comment on the matter. But the church said in a statement it was investing £550,000 to ‘serve the community’ and was ‘saddened by any offence’ it had caused. It added: ‘We have worked with the Ministry of Justice and the local environmental health officer and followed their guidelines to the letter.’
