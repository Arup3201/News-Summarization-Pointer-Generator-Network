Actor Michael Jace was back in court Friday to enter a formal not guilty plea to a murder charge in connection to his wife's shooting death.

The Shield actor waived his right to a preliminary hearing earlier this month, meaning that the case will proceed to trial without an initial presentation of evidence to a judge.

Jace, 51, is accused of shooting his wife, 40-year-old April Jace, in their suburban Los Angeles home on May 19. He pleaded not guilty during his June arraignment.

The couple's children, both under 10, were home at the time and unharmed. The boys are now living with relatives.

Police
 have not disclosed a motive for the slaying but have said they were 
looking into whether financial or other domestic issues may have been 
involved.

The
 family of April Jace has called her death a senseless act of domestic 
violence. Police said Michael Jace called 911 to report the killing in 
their home in the 5400 block of Brynhurst Avenue in Hyde Park. 

Audio
 of Jace's call has not been made public, but fire officials have 
released a 911 call from April Jace's father in which he says the actor 
told him he had shot the victim.

April Jace was discovered in the couple's home dead from multiple gunshot wounds to the upper torso.

According to court records obtained by ABC 7, Michael Jace was involved in a domesitc dispute with his first wife in 1997.

Jace is best known for his role as LAPD officer Julien Lowe on The Shield TV series. He also appeared in the show Southland and had small parts in such classics as Boogie Nights, Forrest Gump and Planet of the Apes.

Despite his success, Michael Jace filed for bankruptcy protection in 2011 due to mounting debts estimated between $500,000 and $1million. He is being held on $2million bail, which his attorney indicated the jailed actor cannot pay.

Mr Jace is due back in court September 19.
