Manchester United will make a decision about the option to buy Radamel Falcao in April and not in the next few days.

Reports in Spain have indicated United will rubber-stamp the Colombian's permanent move from Monaco next week but United's purchase option is at end of the season.

Manchester United will make a decision about the option to buy Radamel Falcao in April as planned

The Colombian latched on to Michael Carrick's header to score during the draw away at Stoke 

The 28-year-old has scored three goals this campaign. 

Falcao latched on to Michael Carrick's flick from a corner during the draw away at Stoke on New Year's Day.

And there is a belief inside Old Trafford that they are beginning to see the sort of quality promised to them when the former Monaco striker signed on deadline day in September.  

While Falcao impressed, Louis van Gaal wasn't overly pleased with his side's defending at Stoke. 

‘I think Stoke were closer to the victory with the ball on the post, and the first chance from Diouf was also not a little chance,’ conceded Van Gaal. ‘So they had two major chances and we didn’t create so much in spite of the time and space.

‘But it’s more difficult because we are not so tall. (Steven) Nzonzi is taller and Crouch is taller, so it’s not so easy. The opponent is always taller than us.’

There had been suggestions that Louis van Gaal was ready to make a decision on Falcao in the coming days
