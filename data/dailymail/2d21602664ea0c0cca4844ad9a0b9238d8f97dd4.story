A Briton who was once the world's fattest man at 70st has spoken about how meeting his American fiancee is the 'best thing that has ever happened' in his life, as he revealed he will quit the UK for the U.S.

Paul Mason, 53, from Ipswich, Suffolk, who has since slimmed down to a comparatively svelte 22st, immediately said 'yes' to Rebecca Mountain, 40, from Orange, Massachusetts, on U.S. television.

Mason said: 'I have never felt like this before. Meeting Rebecca is the best thing that has ever happened to in my life.'

He told the Daily Mirror: 'When
 you get to the other side of 50 you start thinking life has passed you 
by. I did wonder if marriage would ever happen for me.

'I was speechless when she proposed. I wasn't expecting it at all.'

Mountain said: 'A lot of very small things added up to how we are attracted to 
each other. People kept asking me: "Was Paul what you expected?" but it 
wasn't like that. It was chemistry.

'He
 is funny, he makes me laugh. We are easy together. Even though this 
seems extremely spontaneous, we are level headed people.

'Since I first 
contacted Paul we have talked on Skype for between four and eight hours 
every day.'

'I was instantly attracted to Paul's personality. What happens is the chemistry that connects you emotionally drives the physical attraction that follows naturally.'

The former postman has vowed to get 
into the shape of his life for their big day, saying: 'I don’t want to 
go down that aisle in a wheelchair.'

Forty-year-old Miss Mountain, who is a slender 8st, asked for his hand in marriage as they appeared live on ABC's The View, BBC News reported.

And that wasn't the only surprise Mr Mason had in store, as the show's hosts announced that as an engagement present they would donate towards the amount needed to fund surgery to remove excess skin following his dramatic weight loss.

Asked if a date had been set for their wedding, Miss Mountain told The View: 'There’s so many things we need to do to take care of Paul first.

'There will be another surgery for his legs but not for another six to eight months.'

The engagement comes after the pair fell in love online following Mr Mason's incredible 48st weight loss thanks to NHS surgery.

Mr Mason flew to the U.S. in December 
to spend Christmas with Miss Mountain, and also for a consultation with a
 New York-based plastic surgeon who had agreed to carry out the 
procedure for free.

Dr 
Jennifer Capla agreed to donate her time to perform an operation to 
remove the excess skin from Mr Mason's belly and arms, meaning that he 
and Miss Mountain only need to find the cash for his hospital stay and 
drugs.

That's where The View
 stepped in for Mr Mason's second surprise, as they offered to stump up 
the $17,000 (£10,341) he needed to cover the medical expenses.

Mr Mason said: 'I'm excited, all I've got to do is go back to the UK, get a medical visa, and then come back.'

Miss Mountain first got in touch with Mr Mason on Facebook after she saw a television documentary about his extreme obesity.

World's fattest man: At the height of his food 
addiction, Mr Mason was eating an entire pack of bacon, four sausages 
and four eggs with bread and hash browns for breakfast and 
lived in a specially adapted home

Appearing on UK breakfast television 
programme last November, in the week they met in person for the first 
time, she said she 'just felt compelled to reach out and just try to 
help and that's all it was.'

'I
 have a lot of drive and just thought I could write letters and 
support,' she said. 'Things I set my sights on, I just go and do. I just
 knew that I should try and help.

'He's
 incredible, a genuine person. Incredibly honest and open about the 
difficulties he's been through, which helped our relationship.'

Mr Mason's binge eating began in his 20s at the time of his father's death and a deterioration in his mother's health.

He quit his job as a postman when his weight stopped him from finishing his rounds.

As his weight soared he was left unable to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked after full time by council carers.

Firefighters had to demolish the front wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia operation in 2002.

Mr Mason was later given a purpose-built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around. His care bill cost taxpayers an estimated £100,000 a year and is believed to have topped £1million.

Obese: The former postman would then eat quadruple portions of fish and chips along with two kebabs for lunch followed by a roast dinner, curries or pizza and more chips in the evening

At the height of his food addiction, he was eating an entire packet of bacon, four sausages and four eggs complete with bread and hash browns for breakfast.

He would then eat quadruple portions of fish and chips along with two kebabs for lunch followed by a roast dinner, curries or pizza and more chips in the evening.

Mr Mason finally beat the bulge after an NHS operation to fit him with a gastric band, but his life was left on hold as he waited for further surgery to remove the excess skin it left behind.

Now he and Miss Mountain hope that after The View is broadcast in the U.S. on Friday, the publicity surrounding it will help them raise the rest of the cash they need for the aftercare following his surgery.
