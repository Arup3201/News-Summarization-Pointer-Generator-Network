A self-described ‘party princess’ is facing serious charges after allegedly striking and killing a well-known Miami chef.

Karlie Tomica, 20, who styled herself as a ‘Miami Beach Party Princess Livin’ the Dream’ on her Twitter page, was detained after she allegedly ran over executive chef Stefano Riccioletti early Monday morning steps away from the hotel where he worked.

The witness who placed the initial 911 call at around 6am yesterday morning described Tomica as being ‘really drunk.’

Charges: Karlie Tomica, pictured left on her Twitter profile and right, in her booking photo, is accused of leaving the scene of a fatal hit-and-run resulting in the death of a well-known Miami chef

Party girl: Tomica said on her Twitter page that she is a 'party princess' who's 'livin' the dream;' her profile has since been deleted

Loss: Stefano Riccioletti was the executive chef at The Shore Club's Terrazza; he was killed early Monday morning in the hit-and-run

Tomica was driving a 2007 Dodge Charger along Collins Avenue in Miami Beach and struck 49-year-old Riccioletti yards away from the Shelbourne Hotel.

She was apparently driving home after her shift at Nikki Beach, a bar and nightclub. The high-end bar did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment.

Mr Riccioletti, a father of two, was the executive chef at the exclusive Shore Club within the hotel and was just leaving work at the time that he was struck.

According to police reports, he was thrown several feet into the hotel’s driveway.

When paramedics arrived at the scene, they pronounced the chef DOA, according to WSVN.

The arrest affidavit states that Tomica fled the scene immediately after striking the chef. A Good Samaritan who witnessed the incident decided to trail the 20-year-old, placing a call to 911 at the same time.

Witness: This Good Samaritan, who declined to be identified, was integral in tracking down the young woman and reporting the alleged crime

‘I’m actually just following a car that just hit a man on Collins Avenue,’ the man said on 911 tapes, which were released today. ‘As far as I know, at this time, she must have killed him.’

The witness described Tomica as being ‘really drunk’ at the time of the incident.

According to NBC Miami, the witness followed Tomica back to her apartment, further down Collins Avenue.

The affidavit states that upon reaching her apartment, the young woman got out of her vehicle, handed the keys to a valet, and went into her apartment. 

When officers arrived at her apartment, they said in their report that Tomica had slurred speech and smelled of alcohol. She was pictured by NBC Miami being led from her apartment into custody, mascara streaks marring her face.

Tomica is pictured in tears in her booking photo, clutching her hands into fists below her face. She was charged with driving while intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident, but was later freed on $10,000 bond.

It is unclear if she has an attorney.

According to records, Tomica is from Port St. Lucie and has been a student at Florida International University.

The University told MailOnline she is currently not enrolled at the institution.

Both Tomica’s Twitter and Facebook pages have been deleted. 

Lucy Martin, the general manager of the Shore Club, issued a statement saying that Mr Riccioletti was ‘a valued member of our team and will be greatly missed.’
