Nottingham Forest are on the verge of signing Hamburg defender Michael Mancienne for £1.5million.

Manager Stuart Pearce agreed a fee with the Bundesliga side and returned to the Championship side's training camp in Portugal, according to The Daily Telegraph.

Looking elsewhere: Mancienne has made 49 appearances for Bundesliga side Hamburg since 2011

Rare: Mancienne played only four times for Chelsea during his five-year stint at Stamford Bridge

Mancienne was tipped to be a star for Chelsea before leaving the club in 2011 to join Hamburg.

The 26-year-old played for England at all youth levels from Under 16, playing 30 times for the Under 21s, who were managed by Pearce.

But the Feltham-born defender only four league appearances and made two starts for Chelsea.

He spent time at QPR and Wolves on loan during his spell at Stamford Bridge.

He is likely to sign a four-year deal at the City Ground, and will have a medical on Thursday.
