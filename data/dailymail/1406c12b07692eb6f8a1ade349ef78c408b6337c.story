The most popular snack eaten by MPs in the House of Commons is the Jaffa Cake. 

MPs and staff have spent £12,991 out of their own pockets on the chocolate and orange treats in the past five years at outlets and shops in the House.

The total spend on 56 types of biscuits over the same period came to £112,698.

Sweet choice: The Jaffa Cake is the most popular biscuit eaten by MPs in the House of Commons

However, the House of Commons said it could not produce figures to show how much is spent on biscuits handed out for free to staff and MPs during meetings.

McVitie's, which produces more than 1.1billion Jaffa Cakes a year at its factory in Stockport, won a VAT tribunal in 1991 for the treats to be listed as cakes rather than biscuits so VAT is not paid on them.

 1. Jaffa Cakes - £12,991

2. Crawford's Mini Packs (bourbon creams, digestives, custard creams, rich shorties, ginger nuts, fruit shortcake) - £16,829

3. Paterson's Biscuits (individual snack packs of golden crunch, choc-chip cookie, fruit, shortcake, Viennese fingers) - £12,907

4. Oreo biscuits (six in packet) - £6,714

5. Biscuit Luxury Selection (chocolate, shortbread, cherry petticoat tails, choc chip, butterscotch, crofters crumbles) - £6,304

6. Cranberry white chocolate cookie - £5,674

7.
Biscuit Continental Selection (12 Varieties, seven coated with plain, 
milk or white chocolate - including dipped lady fingers, Viennese butter
fingers, mini waffle style) - £4,538

8. Paterson's Biscuit Box (golden crunch, choc chip cookie, fruit, shortcake, Viennese fingers, double choc cookie) - £4,414

9. Oat fruit cookies - £4,312

10. Toffee chocolate pecan cookie - £4,167

VAT is payable on chocolate-covered biscuits, which are classed as luxuries, but not on chocolate-covered cakes which are deemed a 'staple food'. 

A key fact at the tribunal was that Jaffa Cakes go hard when stale, whereas biscuits go soggy.

Despite the request specifying 'expenditure on biscuits', House of Commons chiefs decided to include Jaffa Cakes in the list.

Food and drink in the House of Commons is bought at a subsidised price.

In second place on the list are Crawford's Mini Packs, which include bourbon creams, custard creams, digestives, shortbread, ginger nuts and fruit shortcake.

House of Commons workers spent a total of £16,829 on the Crawford's mini-packs, but because they contain six different biscuits a favourite one could not be established - making Jaffa Cakes the most popular.

A spokesman for the House of Commons said that biscuits doled out free to MPs and staff during meetings were part of the 'general refreshments costs' which it said 'could not be broken down'.

He said: 'The House of Commons procures biscuits for two purposes.

'Firstly biscuits are purchased for resale within catering and retail outlets in the House.

'Secondly they can be purchased as part of a refreshments budget for meetings.

'In respect of biscuits purchased for meetings the information you require is not held by the House of Commons.

'Any expenditure for this purpose would be incorporated into general refreshments costs which cannot be broken down.'

Members of the House of Commons love spending their cash on packets of Jaffa Cakes when they duck out to grab a snack
