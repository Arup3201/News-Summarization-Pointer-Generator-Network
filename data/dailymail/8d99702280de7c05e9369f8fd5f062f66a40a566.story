A pair of identical twin brothers who were caught fighting in a barbaric street brawl have both been given the same jail sentence - because police can’t tell them apart.

Ryan and Grant Seymour, 19, were caught on CCTV - both naked from the waist up - taking part in mass violence, in Biddulph, Staffordshire, on July 6 last year.

A court heard the siblings were seen pelting missiles including a portable television at members of a 'rival' family.

Identical twin brothers Ryan and Grant Seymour were caught fighting in a barbaric street brawl and have both been given the same jail sentence - because police can't tell them apart

A court heard the twins also hurled vases and bottles at their victims  - with one brother attacking a group of men with a spanner.

But because the brothers are almost impossible to tell apart it was 'unclear who did what' as both were naked from the waist up and wearing blue shorts.

They have both sentenced to nine months' detention at a young offenders institute after officers could not work out which one had been involved in more of the violence.

Jailing the pair at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, Judge Paul Glenn said: 'Your conduct has been described by witnesses as mayhem, barbaric and vile.

'You were not the only people to behave disgracefully.

'There was undoubted provocation.

'A group of other men visited the house to cause trouble.

'That was the catalyst for what followed.

'The trouble started in the house and spilled out onto the street. We can see from the CCTV how close this was to the centre of Biddulph.'

The court heard the vicious attack was sparked when members of the Yoxall family banged on the door of the twins’ friend Daniel Tatters’s home.

Prosecuting Oliver Woolhouse, said: 'A witness living in South View described hearing a disturbance in the street.

'He could see from his living room window four men go into a house.

'A short time later a man was heard hammering on the door, it was opened and he went inside, followed by six others.

'A Peugeot 306 car and a van appeared and the occupants of the car got out and stood by the front door.

'A man then appeared, he was bleeding heavily from his head and was followed by the rest of the men.

'They were shouting at each other and there was something of a stand-off.

The twins also hurled missiles at their victims  - with one brother attacking a group of men with a spanner. But because the brothers (left Ryan and right Grant) are impossible to tell apart it was 'unclear who did what'

Probably the most famous twins in criminal history were Ronnie and Reggie Kray from Bethnal Green in east London. It was reported that early on in their careers, both twins were arrested for a particularly vicious assault but the police did not prosecute because they could not identify which twin was the assailant.

Since identical twins - also known as monozygotic twins - come from the same fertilised egg, it was believed that they have the same DNA. However, a new test is being developed which would enable twins' DNA to be told apart by scientists in Germany.

They have found a subtle genetic difference which means there is now a definitive test to learn which twin was at the scene of a crime.

This breakthrough will stop the current procedure whereby one twin might escape justice because of the inability of the authorities to tell them apart.

'The witness says one of the twins had a small portable TV that was thrown through the car window.

'Glass bottles and vases were also thrown at the vehicle before the driver of the car attempted to drive away.

'One of the twins then attacked the vehicle with a large metal spanner. His arm was bleeding.'

The pair both admitted one count of affray and Ryan was also caged for a further 15 months to run consecutively for an unrelated affray for an earlier incident.

Jason Holt, defending Ryan, said: 'It is accepted that the other family came to the house of Daniel Tatters and that’s what caused this incident in the first place.

'They even blocked both ends of the road with a car and a van.

'Mr Seymour has matured since this incident, he is no longer the angry man he once was.

'He even apologises to the people of South View who saw this going on.'

Robert Smith, defending Grant, added: 'Since this offence in July last year there has not been any further incident involving Grant.

'He is now a roofer and has stuck at it. He has reduced his drinking and now has a stable life. He has been out of trouble.'

Co-accused, Daniel Tatters, 29, and Peter Holland, 36, both from Biddulph, were each handed a 12-month community order, with supervision for 12 months, and ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work.
