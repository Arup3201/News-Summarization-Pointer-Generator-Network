A schoolgirl who was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman in Pakistan has undergone successful surgery, it was revealed today..

Doctors at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham have confirmed that Malala Yousafzai, 15, underwent cranial reconstruction and cochlear implantation procedures yesterday.

A hospital spokeswoman said Malala’s medical team were 'very pleased' with her progress following the operations, which lasted for around five hours.

Commenting on the surgery, the spokeswoman said: 'Both operations were a success and Malala is now recovering.

'Her condition is described as stable and her medical team are very pleased with the progress she has made so far. She is awake and talking to staff and members of her family.'

Malala has been receiving treatment 
at the hospital since she was flown to Britain last October after being 
shot in north-west Pakistan for promoting women’s rights.

The Pakistani schoolgirl has since been nominated for this
 year's Nobel Peace Prize.

At the start of January a 
frail-looking Malala hugged and waved goodbye to staff at the hospital, 
where she has undergone months of life-saving surgery following the 
failed assassination attempt that left her with a bullet in her brain.

She continued her rehabilitation at the family's temporary West Midlands home before undergoing the major reconstructive operation.

Last Wednesday, doctors at the hospital said that Malala was set to undergo surgery for what they hoped would be the last time.

The teenager required the fitting of a custom-made titanium plate to repair damage to her skull, as well as a cochlear implant to help her recover hearing in her left ear.

Speaking earlier this week, Dr Dave Rosser, medical director at the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, said both procedures were routinely carried out at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

Dr Rosser described Malala as a 'remarkable young woman' who had made great progress in her recovery.

He also said she was fully aware of the threats the Taliban had made against her life.

During the media briefing Dr Rosser said: "She's not naive at all about what happened to her and the situation in terms of her high-profile.

'She's incredibly determined to continue to speak for her cause.'

Dr Rosser said it could take 'between
 15 and 18 months' for any hearing to recover in her left ear but added 
that in time she would have almost normal levels of hearing, thanks to 
the surgery.

He also credited the surgeons who operated on Malala in Pakistan soon after she was shot with saving her life.

Malala escaped death by a matter of 
inches when she was shot on October 9 last year - as the bullet entered 
just above her left eye and ran along her jaw - 'grazing' her brain.

In a statement, the hospital said 
Malala would continue her recuperation as a patient until she was well 
enough to be discharged.

Stefan
 Edmondson, Principal Maxillofacial Prosthetist at the trust, explained 
how the plate would be fitted over a hole in Malala’s skull, which has 
been left by the path of the bullet.

Dr Dave Rosser praised Malala's sense of humour and bravery

It was also revealed that the damaged 
portion of missing skull had been implanted in Malala’s abdomen - where 
it remains - in case it was needed to repair her skull at a later date.

However, surgeons have now decided instead to fit the metal plate.

Malala was put forward for the Nobel prize by three Norwegian MPs, 
who praised her 'commitment so threatening to extremists that they tried
 to kill her'.

Freddy de Ruiter, from the country's 
ruling Labor party, said her courage in speaking out, particularly on 
the subject of a girls' right to education, made her a worthy candidate.

Gorm Kjernli said on the party's website yesterday that the teenager had 'made ​​a strong impression on the whole world.'

Magne Rommetveit said Malala was now 
'an important symbol in the struggle against the destructive forces that
 will prevent democracy, equality and human rights.'

Dr Rosser credited the surgeons who operated on Malala in Pakistan soon after she was shot for saving her life.

Malala's
 bravery has moved the world in the months since she was targeted by the
 Taliban in Pakistan for heroically speaking out for women's rights and 
freedom of access to education in the country.

Dr
 Rosser said Malala had already undergone surgery since her discharge 
from the Birmingham Hospital at the start of the year, to repair a 
facial nerve severed in the gun attack.

'The facial nerve was damaged by the course of the bullet,' he said.

'The facial nerve comes under the ear, but the surgeon was able to re-route and reconnect it.

'The surgeon has managed to do that without having to take a graft from another nerve.

'Malala
 does have a weakness in her face so the left side of her face droops, 
but there's a good chance she will completely recover within 18 months.'

Malala Yousufzai was attacked and shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in Pakistan for campaigning for education for girls

Malala was flown to Britain for specialist treatment at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital after escaping death when a bullet 'grazed' her brain

Malala is now likely to secure permanent 
residence in the UK after her father was granted a job with the 
Pakistani consulate in Birmingham.

The Taliban have vowed to target her again.
