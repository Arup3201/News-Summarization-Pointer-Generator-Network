Police have arrested seven men on suspicion of murder after the body of a white adult was found in a well in the front garden of a house in Surrey

Specialist divers are on the scene and assessing how to remove the body, which is partially submerged in 4ft of water, without destroying any evidence

A murder investigation was launched today after evidence emerged that the body had been placed in the well

Divers have now recovered the body, though say they are still unable to determine the gender. A postmortem exam will be carried out tomorrow at 2pm

Police divers have now removed the body 
and a postmortem examination will be carried out at East Surrey Hospital
 mortuary tomorrow afternoon.

The well is located in the front garden of a home on Audley Drive set in an acre of land. The gardeners found it while tidying up at the property.

Officers cannot say what gender the victim is and would not confirm if any of the male suspects were residents of the address.

Detective Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons said: 'It is a murder investigation. As far as I am concerned, when a body is found in a well, it either fell in there, or was placed in there, and the evidence is apparent that the body was placed in there.'

Speaking about the body, he added: 'It's not been there for an extended period of time, it will be a matter of weeks at the most.'

The gardeners were tidying up at the 
property, which is set in an acre of land on a road of semi-detached 
properties, when they spotted the body

The suburban cul-de-sac comprises around 50 semi-detached homes and sits opposite a sports field. Houses on the road have an average asking price of £370,000.

Officers would not confirm whether any of the seven men lived at the house on Audley Drive

The house is set within an acre of grand and others on the same road have an asking price of £370,000

The body was found in the narrow shaft of a well outside this house on Audley Drive, Warlingham

Officers from the Met Police's Homicide and Major Crime Command are investigating.

Detective Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons has appealed for anyone who had concerns about a person who has gone missing, especially if they had connections to that area, to come forward.

Anyone with information is urged to call police on 020 8721 4961 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
