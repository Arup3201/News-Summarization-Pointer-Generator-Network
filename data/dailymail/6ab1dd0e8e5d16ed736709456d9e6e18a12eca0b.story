A grandmother believed to have been dead for 15 minutes after suffering a heart attack was brought back to life by a paramedic.

Moya Stevenson, 53, suffered a severe heart attack on January 16 and was found face down and unconscious on her living room floor after her distress call reached the ambulance service.

Paramedic Rick Leonardi, 37, spent 15 minutes massaging and shocking Mrs Stevenson's heart back into action - saving her life.

She was then rushed to the King's Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, before being taken to Nottingham City Hospital by Mr Leonardi's colleagues Tony Evans and Liam Waring.

On Friday, the grateful grandmother from Sutton-in-Ashfield met her three heroes to say thank you.

The mother-of-one said: 'I'm very grateful - It's a strange relationship, as I didn't know Mr Leonardi or the other paramedics but we looked into each others' eyes and I said 'thank you'. It was very emotional.

'If he hadn't got here so quickly and done his job so well, I just wouldn't be here now.

'It's scary to think I was dead for 15 minutes, Mr Leonardi saved my life by doing what he did.

'I can't believe I am still here and I shouldn't have survived this, if you have a full cardiac arrest in a hospital bed you will be lucky to survive, let alone in my own home.

'I owe Mr Leonardi everything, my life.

'I don't remember much from the day, I just remember I woke up in a hospital bed, I stayed in there for three weeks, but it felt like two days.

'The ambulance service don't get enough credit for what they do, they do amazing work.

'My family and friends can't believe I am still alive, no-one can, it is just amazing.

I have't come out of this completely unscathed, my right side doesn't react how it used to and it is hard for me to walk, although my brain is fine which is a relief.

'I can hardly concentrate and my memory is hazy. I'm just thankful they were there for me.

Mr Leonardi, who has worked for East Midlands Ambulance Service for the past 10 years was first on the scene in his rapid-response vehicle - six minutes after her distress call.

He said: 'When I got to her she was unconscious, face-down in her front room.

'It was just me and her. It immediately appeared that she was dead.

'After the third shock, I carried on CPR and managed to get a pulse back. But the prognosis is still very bleak at that point. Time is absolutely of the essence."

After Mr Leonardi had managed to coax some life back into Mrs Stevenson, his colleagues worked an extra two-and-a-half hours to get her to City Hospital and make sure she was safe.

Mr Evans said: 'I just wanted to carry it on - I am proud of that, I suppose.

'I wanted to give her the best possible chance of survival.

'It's an honour to be part of the story and to know that what we did made a difference."

Paramedic team leader Mr Waring said: 'Only eight per cent of community cardiac arrests survive, so she's one of the lucky ones, especially to be in such good health now.'
