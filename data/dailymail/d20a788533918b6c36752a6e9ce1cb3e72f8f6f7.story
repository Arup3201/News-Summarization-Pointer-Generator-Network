For anyone who's ever driven in a large city, red lights quickly become a massive annoyance.

However, Audi is developing a system that could spell the end of red lights for drivers.

It is testing a system known as 'Traffic Light Assist' that shows drivers exactly how far away their next red is - helping they time their drive to minimise stopping.

Audi's latest feature will tell drivers when traffic lights are about to change - and warn if you're about to run a red light.

Information from the traffic light systems is transmitted to the car and shown on the dashboard - or eventually on a heads up display.

When combined with the motion sensors and speed information from the car, drivers can be told exactly how to avoid stopping at red lights.

It shows the driver the speed to select in order to reach the next traffic light during a green phase.

Acoustic signals also warn the driver in advance of red lights.

The display, in the dashboard in front of drivers, shows a traffic light iconÂ  with a countdown timer that reads the number of seconds before a light changes from red to green.

The system, is linked into a city's electronic traffic light network, and can even take into account lane changes.

Local data from city councils who install smart traffic lights, and motion sensors in the car are used to to predict exactly how long it'll be until the green light goes red.

Audi has been testing the new technology in Ingolstadt and Berlin in Germany, as well as in Verona, Italy, and also set it up in Las Vegas for the CES show.

In the traffic light phase assistant project in Frankfurt, 20 traffic light systems in the vicinity of Frankfurt am Main were retrofitted so that the test fleet could communicate with them.

Audi also showed off their new Sport Quattro Concept car during the Audi keynote at the International Consumer Electronics Show, which features laser headlights

'The goal of developers was to achieve the most efficient flow of traffic in metropolitan areas,' said Audi.

'Information from the traffic light systems is transmitted to the car and visualized as graphic images on the driver information system display.

'They show the driver the speed to select in order to reach the next traffic light during a green phase. Acoustic signals also warn the driver in advance of red phases. '

Audi claims the traffic light info online enables CO2 reductions of up to 15 percent.

how the system could work: Audi says it hopes smart cruise control could be integrated so automatically set the car's speed

'In sum, this would be equivalent to about 900 million liters (237.75 million US gallons) of fuel per year, if this technology were to be implemented throughout Germany,' it claims.

Over the course of the six-month test phase, a total of 500 test drivers in 120 cars and three motorcycles covered a total of 1.65 million kilometers (1.03 million miles).

The vehicles were networked with one another via specially developed radio transmission equipment and via a traffic control center to inform drivers of traffic conditions and hazards.
