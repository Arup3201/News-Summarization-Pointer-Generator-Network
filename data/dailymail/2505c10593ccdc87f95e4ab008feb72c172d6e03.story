One of the most memorable images of the year must be the delighted face of the Queen as her horse Sign Manual raced to victory at Newbury just before her 87th birthday in April.

If nothing stirs your blood like the stampeding of thoroughbred hooves down the flat and crowds cheering as the winner takes the final fence, this is surely the ideal living location.

A new housing development - with a deferential nod to tradition - makes Newbury the first racecourse in Britain to develop its extensive grounds for housing. It includes luxury, grandstand-style apartments with a direct view along the famous straight mile.

GRANDSTAND DESIGN: Helen and Lucy love their racecourse home

The first recorded racing at Newbury was in 1805, but the racecourse itself wasn't constructed until almost a century later, in 1904. A century  on, it's the Queen's favourite, and she visits it every year for her birthday.

The historic nature of the Berkshire town, and the Royal connection, made it imperative that the new housing development, called Living At The Racecourse, was built in as sympathetic a style as possible.

A joint development between David Wilson Homes and the racecourse itself, it's part of a plan to redevelop the venue and the surrounding area. In total, 1,500 new homes are being built in 300 acres of the grounds.

The first phase of the accommodation is now available in the form  of more than 400 townhouses and apartments.

The houses are built in elegant red-brick crescents near the entrance to the racecourse and set among majestic and mature oak trees. Prices range from £295,000 to £458,000.

The first occupant, solicitor and racing fan Helen Childs, was initially attracted to the development by its proximity to the racecourse.

But when she looked around the 1,875 sq ft, five-bedroom, three-bathroom house with her children Lucy, 11, and Joe, 14, she realised  that the location and layout made  it ideal for a family with slightly  older children. They moved in three months ago.

'Joe has the whole of the top floor with a bedroom and his own bathroom,' she says.

The other spare room on that floor is for her father, who visits every weekend from Northamptonshire.

'He is a big fan of racing, and delighted we have moved,' says Helen.

Lucy, meanwhile, says her bedroom is like a hotel room.

The house has a front-facing reading room on the first floor with a vast window running the length of the wall, and a small balcony. This can be used as a second sitting room, a spare room or - as here - a bedroom for a very fortunate daughter.

The bright and warm kitchen, with integrated appliances, opens on to the garden. 'That's what finally sold it to me,' says Helen.

'It gets the evening sun, and the outside flows in. It's like living between town and countryside. Joe is able to get to school independently, which he really likes. Lucy is a massive shopper and we are ten minutes from the town, which has plenty of high street chains.

'She was also able to go and see Rita Ora singing at the Racecourse all by herself.'

The theatre and cinema are similarly close, and the railway station - with a direct service to Paddington - is just five minutes' walk.

The housing comes with the benefits of managed lawns and access  to a gym and spa, and buyers can choose their own finishes for bathrooms and kitchens.

The next phase of executive homes are the 102 trackside apartments to be completed next year. So far 25 have been sold.

Paul Crispin, managing director  of David Wilson Homes Southern, says: 'The Racecourse, Newbury, offers a superb range of quality  new homes, ranging from contemporary trackside apartments and executive houses to townhouses in traditional crescents and squares,  all set around a mature landscape of beautiful trees.

'Each element of the development is designed to complement surroundings through architecture and use of space.

'Residents will be able to enjoy access to the racecourse facilities year round, the Nuffield Health Club on site, and beautiful walking and cycling routes.'
