A young British aid worker has died from malaria while volunteering at a primary school in Kenya, it emerged today.

Christi Kelly, 21, was cooking meals for poverty-stricken children and teaching them to dance when she fell ill. She was taken to a hospital six hours away in the capital, Nairobi, on Tuesday but died the following day.

Miss Kelly's stunned family from Ilfracombe, Devon, said she had all the necessary injections and was taking anti-malaria tablets when she contracted the virus.

The former university student was three months into a ten-month European Union assignment with Moving Mountains, a trust which improves social conditions in Kenya.

She was stationed in the western county of Siaya, living at an orphanage and teaching dance at the local primary school.

Miss Kelly's heartbroken mother Carol Kelly said she was desperate for answers about her daughter's death.

She last spoke with her on Sunday, when Miss Kelly said she had been in bed and was feeling unwell.

Carol Kelly, 41, said: 'She was teaching the children to dance, she absolutely loved it out there.

'She was 
living at the orphanage and teaching at the primary school. She taught 
dance but she obviously helped out with the cooking and so on.

'As far as we're aware, everything happened very quickly.

'I think 
she went to hospital on Tuesday and died on Wednesday morning at around 6
 a.m. - but it's all very unclear at the moment.

'We had been speaking to her a lot more because of all the troubles in Kenya but they were fine.

'It's got the highest rate of malaria but she had had all her injections and was taking tablets.'

Miss Kelly attended Ilfracombe Arts College before completing a foundation degree in Dance and Community Work Practice at Plymouth university.

She became a youth worker for Devon Youth Services and taught at the Rebecca Varley Dance School in Ilfracombe.

Miss Kelly
 was on her second overseas assignment, having carried out environmental
 aid work in Borneo last year during a three month trip with Raleigh 
International.

Carol
 Kelly, who has three other children, said: 'She was full of life and a 
huge character, which is why everyone's so devastated.

'She loved everyone, cared about everyone and drove everyone crazy. She loved life and she was too young.

'She was very passionate about helping young people - that was her life. She was a real people person.

'It's a real comfort to think that she had all these amazing experiences.'

Experts
 said anti-malaria drugs have to be specific to the region the traveller
 is visiting as some tablets are not effective in certain places.

Dr Colin Berry, of Cardiff University School of Biosciences, said: 'Most malarial deaths occur in Sub Saharan Africa and most of them are children under the age of five.

'Africa is a particularly bad place for malaria. There are effective drugs but there are resistant parasites.

'In terms of the life-cycle of a parasite, once you're bitten, the parasite goes to the liver and spends a couple of weeks there before it comes out into your blood

'If the drug level isn't sufficient when the parasite enters the blood stage, there will be problems.

'Before going on a holiday, you wouldn't go to a chemist and pick an anti malarial tablet off the shelf, you would have to go to a GP/travel clinic where they would look at where you were visiting.

'This is because one malaria tablet which may be effective in one country, may not be in another.'

Hundreds of mourners gathered at Ilfracombe seafront on Thursday evening to release balloons in memory of Miss Kelly, who was known as Belle to her many friends.

Her Facebook page has been inundated with tributes.

Brogan Hewitt wrote: 'Rest in peace Belle, such a lovely person. You'll be truly missed.'

Chyna Vickery added: 'You'll never be forgotten. One of my best friends taken too early, the least selfish person I know. Keep dancing up there Belle.'

Danica Bawn said: 'Heaven has gained another angel, so sad. You had a good soul Christi Belle Kelly, may you rest in peace.'

Malaria is a serious tropical disease
 spread by mosquitoes and if it's not diagnosed and treated promptly, it 
can be fatal. It only takes a single mosquito bite for someone to become
 infected.

Symptoms include a fever, sweats and chills, headaches, vomiting, muscle pains and diarrhoea. 

These
 usually appear between seven and 18 days after a person becomes infected, 
though the disease can lay dormant for up to a year in some cases before symptoms begin to show, 
according to the NHS.

Malaria is found in more than 100, mainly tropical, countries.

The
 most common regions for malaria include large areas of Africa and Asia;
 Central and South America; Haiti and the Dominican Republic; parts of 
the Middle East and some Pacific islands.

The
 latest World Health Organization statistics show there were 207 million
 cases of malaria worldwide and 627,000 deaths in 2012. 

That year, some 1,400 Britons returned to the UK having contracted malaria and two of them died.

There
 is currently no vaccine available that offers protection against 
malaria, so it is very important travelers take antimalarial medication 
to reduce the chances of becoming infected.

However, antimalarials only 
reduce the risk of infection by about 90 per cent. As such, taking steps
 to avoid bites is also vital.
