Welcome to my first MailOnline boxing column. This is where I’ll be sharing views and news from Matchroom Boxing and the logical place to start is the subject of a Carl Froch-George Groves  re-match. It’s logical because it is a fight I get asked about every day.

It’s also something I am working very hard on and I hope to have a more concrete answer in the next two weeks. In the meantime, I can give you an idea of the sorts of discussions that have been going on behind the scenes.

We have had a lot of conversations with both fighters and it’s a fight I think needs to happen this year. If we strike a deal, and there’s still some way to go, then it’s a fight I would like to put on in a big stadium on one of the last two Saturdays in May. We have spoken to Wembley and numerous other stadiums already – I believe this fight would draw a crowd of 70,000 or 80,000.

Slugging it out: A re-match between Carl Froch (left) and George Groves would be massive

Fast start: Groves (right), caught Froch unawares with the ferocity of his attack in the early stages

Hold it right there: Referee Howard Foster stopped the fight in the ninth, leading to a controversial win for Froch

The important factor in all this is what Carl wants. He is the unified champion and in the closing stages of his career he has dreams and aspirations, especially to fight in Las Vegas. Groves has options and has spoken to other promoters, but obviously he wants Carl most. And the public want this fight so much – they want answers as to what may have happened after that fantastic fight and the controversy of George being stopped.

Carl has four options – a rematch with WBA super-middleweight champion Andre Ward, who beat Carl in 2011; Gennady Golovkin, the middleweight world champion; Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr, the former middleweight champion. Then there’s Groves. We all know about George.  

To my mind, the Ward fight, commercially speaking, is not big enough. The only reason for them to fight is Carl wants revenge, but he wants it badly. The money is not comparable for the Ward fight to the Groves and Chavez fight. Chavez is an easier fight, if you ask me, but politically it would be tough because of the re-match clauses and the money Chavez wants.

I don’t see many reasons for Golovkin to move from middleweight and I have been told by various sources that their team believes Carl is the toughest fight out there. That’s the fight his people ooh, ah and wince at. It would be a truly great fight between two warriors, but I don’t think Golovkin is quick enough or awkward enough to grit it out with Carl at 168lbs.

Laying out his vision: MailOnline's new columnist Eddie Hearn would love to organise the Froch-Grove re-match

is the door open? Hearn says the public appetite for a Froch-Groves re-match is massive

With Groves, we know his demands and it is too much, but having not really entered the negotiation period properly, I still believe we can find some middle ground.

At the moment, we are putting the options together and forecasting the financials and saying: ‘Right, these are the fights and these are the numbers.’ If you ask me I’ll always go with the one with the biggest numbers unless it is very close and one fight is easier or in Las Vegas, where Carl has always wanted to fight.

My gut feeling is that it will happen this year. I spoke about it with Carl last week. We talked about the fact it is a big fight and that it will still be around down the line but I don’t agree with that. If Groves takes another fight and loses, his value would diminish, and if he wins, he may want a greater split which would make it more difficult to negotiate.

Carl has made a career out of giving the public what they want but he really doesn’t like Groves. Last time, George was the mandatory challenger so Carl had no choice but to fight him or lose the belt.

Now, in Carl’s mind, there is no reason to fight George other than the money and the fact it is what the people want to see. Pride? I don’t think he feels in his head that he has a lot to prove, but at the same point, the animosity between the two could potentially drive him like never before.

Get it off the ground: One of the most important factors is whether Froch wants the re-match

He won the fight, although he does feel it was stopped too early. He wishes it would have gone on 10 or 15 seconds because he’s convinced he would have finished it in devastating fashion. I, like many, believe he would have gone on to win the fight – but these unanswered questions make this potentially the biggest bout in British boxing history.

Even now, a couple of months after the fight, I can’t quite believe how good the fight was. Styles make fights and that is why Groves was wrong for Carl with his speed and movement. He surprised me with how well he did, even though everyone in boxing knows what power George has.

I was there at the press conference when George said he was going to stand and trade in the middle of the ring. To be honest, after that press conference, that was the first time I thought Carl was going to be absolutely fine.

I always thought he would win, but that made me certain. I thought Groves had looked worried in the face-off and was nervous. Obviously I was wrong. George was fantastic – I had him two rounds up at the time of the stoppage.

Not firing: Despite his victory, Froch was not as tuned in for the Groves fight as he was for his clashes against Mikkel Kessler (below left) and Lucian Bute (below right)

When you look back at the night, in the changing room beforehand, Carl wasn’t firing. For Mikkel Kessler and Lucian Bute he was so ready. This time, it was very cold in the room. Everyone was rushing around and the mood was just a bit off.

I thought the problem was Carl’s hunger, like: ‘What have I got to prove here?’ I think Carl likes to prove people wrong. He had that in his rematch against Kessler, having lost their first fight, and he was fighting to save his career against Bute. They were probably two of his best fights.

Carl didn’t have that hungry mindset against Groves. If we make this fight, I am convinced he would.

I have always like the Daily Mail’s boxing coverage. I remember spending some time with Jeff Powell a few years ago when I was promoting Audley Harrison. Jeff had come out to join us at Big Bear Mountain in California, where Audley was training for his fight with David Haye.

We had heard that three murderers were on the loose and hiding out in the mountains, which was a bit of a talking point while we were up there. Anyway, Jeff and I went out with Audley and a few of his entourage one morning for a run up the mountain.

After a while, we heard this noise from the side of the road and then three guys wearing Scream masks jumped out from behind a rock and they were holding bats. I thought I was going to have a heart attack. It turned out it was three of Audley’s sparring partners.

My aim for 2014 is more domestic fights. I love a good domestic fight – the storyline is often that much better and you know what you are getting with British fighters. You can watch a Mexican on YouTube, and he can look great, but then you fly them all the way over here and they don’t fancy it. Give me a proper fight.

I always say to the foreign agents: ‘Tell them to try their nuts off because I want to watch a proper fight and I am paying the purse.' There’s nothing worse than my fighter getting an easy night because then no one gets value for money.

Exciting: But you'll have to read Eddie's thoughts on Anthony Joshua (centre) in his next session

You know what you are getting with a domestic fight and our show on February 1 in Cardiff is looking superb. We have Lee Selby fighting world title challenger Rendall Munroe for the European and British featherweight titles and that is going to be excellent.

Former world champion Gavin Rees is also fighting Gary Buckland and then we have Anthony Joshua fighting against Dorian Darch. I can’t tell you enough how excited I am by Anthony Joshua.

I’ll save what I think about him for another column.
