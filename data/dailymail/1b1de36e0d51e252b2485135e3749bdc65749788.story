Interest rates could be cut even further from their already record low of just 0.5 per cent, the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney revealed this morning.

The Bank chief said the banking system could cope with interest rates being cut closer to zero – but refused to say how far they could fall.

However, Mr Carney insisted it was still more likely that rates would go up after inflation returns to normal after a period of falling prices this year.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said interest could be cut below 0.5 per cent - but it was still more likely that they would rise

Mr Carney this morning insisted the current low inflation was temporary and will return to its 2 per cent target within two years.

‘What's important is that workers and businesses understand this is a temporary phenomena,’ he told MPs.

The Bank chief added: ‘Enjoy it while it lasts because petrol prices are not going to continue to fall. Food prices are not going to continue to fall.’

Mr Carney said that three-quarters of the current weakness in inflation was due to falling prices of oil and food, which he said was a ‘temporary, one-off development’.

He stressed that if there was any evidence of a sustained fall in inflation, the Bank could ‘if necessary’ cut interest rates from their current 0.5 per cent low to zero, but he emphasised that the ‘focus of policy is towards tightening’.

He said: ‘Because of the resilience of banking and building societies has increased, we are in a position where we could, if necessary, cut bank rates towards zero. That is – to a level that is still above zero – but we haven’t specified a specific level.’

Mr Carney this morning insisted the current low inflation was temporary and will return to its 2 per cent target within two years.

Today's 0.5 per cent interest rates are already an historic low after soaring to 17 per cent in the 1980s

But he said: ‘We are not having an active discussion about it, because the focus of policy has been towards the timing and degree of tightening where appropriate.’

Mr Carney added: ‘The bank rate is more likely than not to be higher than it is at present at the end of the forecast period.’

The Bank's base rate has been at a record low of 0.5 per cent for nearly six years. Markets are currently expecting an interest rate rise in early 2016.

However, in written evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, Martin Weale, one of two members of the MPC to have voted to raise interest rates late last year, said it ‘may be appropriate to raise Bank Rate rather earlier than financial markets currently anticipate’.

His warning chimed with an earlier speech by MPC member Kristin Forbes, who said there were risks to the economy if interest rates remained at their record low rate for too long.

She said a rate hike might be needed ‘in the near future’.
