A mother survived when a Jeep smashed into her home because she was watching EastEnders on TV, a court has heard.

Lucie Flowers, 38, of Nelson, near Caerphilly, South Wales, had just settled down to watch her favourite TV soap when the two-ton vehicle ploughed into her bedroom.

Mother-of-three Ms Flowers had been in the bedroom moments earlier but dashed out when she heard the EastEnders theme tune.

Newly-qualified driver Robbie Morgan, 18, of Treharris, Merthyr Tydfil, appeared in court on crutches today four months after the incident in December.

He did not enter a plea for a charge of dangerous driving and was released
on bail to appear for a committal hearing to crown court next month.

Magistrates at Cwmbran heard Morgan's car crashed into a Renault Megane 
before veering off the road, hitting a female pedestrian and coming to 
rest embedded in the house.

They heard his Jeep Cherokee nosedived into the two-storey extension leaving a mess of rubble and twisted wreckage.

The pedestrian, 18, was rushed to hospital with serious injuries and is still recovering as an outpatient. 

Ms Flowers said at the time: 'If it wasn’t for EastEnders I would’ve been in that room.

'I heard a big bang and then a rumble and I thought it was an earthquake as the whole house shook.

'We rushed out of the house and saw what had happened, I couldn’t believe it - thank God I was watching EastEnders.'

Police and passersby stop to look at the damaged house where a mattress can be seen hanging from the wreck.
