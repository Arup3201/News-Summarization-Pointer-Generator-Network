England captain Wayne Rooney has been Photoshopped on to the body of historical leaders Horatio Nelson, Winston Churchill, Henry VIII and the Duke of Wellington.

Bookmaker William Hill decided to create the portraits after Gary Lineker said Rooney, who will win his 100th cap against Slovenia on Saturday, deserves to be recognised as one of the nation's greatest players.

Lineker, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, said: 'He has to rank right up there in the pantheon of English football's finest.'

A team of Photoshop artists went as far as matching skin tones to the England striker before engraining him in the oil paintings of the legendary figures.

William Hill spokesperson Joe Crilly said: 'Rooney is nearing the appearance record and with plenty of years in hand, not only is it likely that he break the record but in all likelihood will smash it.

'Rooney has the ability to enter England’s Hall of Fame and perhaps become one of the country’s greatest leaders.'

The Manchester United forward is England's fourth-highest top scorer having scored 43 goals in 99 internationals.
