Bill Clinton and Mayor Michael Bloomberg have led the tributes for Ed Koch at his funeral today, remembering him as the quintessential New Yorker who breathed new life into the city he loved.

Hundreds of mourners filled Manhattan's grand Temple Emanu-El to pay respects to the former New York mayor, who died of congestive heart failure on Friday at age 88.

At the close of the service, Koch's casket was carried from the synagogue to a standing ovation from relatives, friends and politicians from across the political spectrum as 'New York, New York' played.

President Clinton had cut short a trip to Japan to speak at the funeral. In a touching tribute, he described as Koch a great friend who had offered invaluable support to him and his wife, Hillary.

'He had a big brain but he had a bigger heart,' he said.

Koch
 was a friend of both Bill and Hillary Clinton, and was helpful 
during her successful campaign for the U.S. Senate from New York. He also backed Hillary 
Clinton in her presidential run.

Clinton recounted Koch writing to him last year to inquire about Hillary's health, never saying that he too was ill. 

'We're all doing fine but we all miss you,' Clinton said. 'And we miss you so much because we all know we're doing a lot better because you lived and served.'

Mayor Bloomberg called Koch, who served from 1978 until 1989, 'our city's quintessential mayor'.

'I don't think anyone embodied the spirit of New York like he did and I don't think anyone ever will,' he said.

'The New York that Ed inherited is almost unimaginable today. There was graffiti, crime, a broken government and whole neighbourhoods 
that looked like they had been bombed out in an air raid.

'He restored the arc of our city’s history. He reminded us why we loved New York, and he inspired us to fight for it. The city we know today would not have existed without him.'

He concluded: 'Ed you did great, you really did great.'

His nephews opened the service, by explaining: 'To you he was the mayor, the friend,
 the movie reviewer, the voice of reason. To our children he was the 
doting uncle Eddie.

'He encouraged us to be all we could be. He encouraged us to follow our dreams - after all it worked out pretty well for him.

'The city of New York was blessed to 
have him as its mayor and because of you, he truly felt New York was the
 best place in the world.'

Mourners also heard about Koch's other 
fierce loyalty - towards Israel. The Israeli consul general lauded Koch 
for the support he had given the Jewish community.

Among the mourners was City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who said Koch frequently gave her advice, but 'at the end of
 every conversation he would say, "Just do what you want, and if people 
don't like it, just bleep 'em".'

Former mayor Rudy Giuliani said Koch would be remembered for what he achieved in office and his boundless optimism.

'It's a sad day,' Mr. Giuliani told the 
New York Times. 'Not too many people, if anyone, contributed more to New
 York City than Ed Koch. It’s a life full of contributions and 
achievement. He was so optimistic. We should feel guilty feeling too 
sad. He wouldn’t want us to.'

New York's senators Charles E. Schumer and Kirsten E. Gillibrand joined former Gov. George E. Pataki and current Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in the congregation at the synagogue.

Koch will be buried in Trinity Church
 Cemetery in Manhattan, beneath tombstone he earlier had inscribed with 
the words of murdered journalist Daniel Pearl: 'My father is Jewish. My 
mother is Jewish. I am Jewish.'

Mr. Koch also wrote his own epitaph: 'He was fiercely proud of his Jewish faith. He fiercely defended the City of New York, and he fiercely loved its people. Above all, he loved his country, the United States of America, in whose armed forces he served in World War II.'

'I don't want to leave Manhattan, 
even when I'm gone,' Koch told The Associated Press in 2008 after 
purchasing the burial plot in Trinity Church Cemetery. 'This is my home. 
The thought of having to go to New Jersey was so distressing to me.'

The
 funeral was held at one of the nation's most prominent synagogues, a
 Reform Jewish congregation on Fifth Avenue. Bloomberg is a member, as 
are comedian Joan Rivers and former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer.

Koch led his city for 12 years, with a brash, humor-tinged style that came to personify the New York of the 1980s.

The
 Democratic mayor is credited with helping save New York from its 
economic crisis in the 1970s and leading it to financial rebirth. But 
during his three terms as mayor, he also faced racial tensions and 
corruption among political allies, as well as the AIDS epidemic, 
homelessness and urban crime.

Koch lost the Democratic nomination for 
mayor in 1989 to David Dinkins, who succeeded him. He said he was 
defeated 'because of longevity.' In his words, 'people get tired of 
you.'

Legacy: New York City Councilman Stephen Levin and Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney hold a sign to propose a name change for the 77th Street subway station to Mayor Edward I. Koch Way on Monday

But as the votes were coming in, he said he told himself: 'I'm free at last.'

Also on Monday, U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney will make a recommendation to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to rename a Manhattan subway station in Koch's honor.

She will propose that the subway station at East 77th Street and Lexington Avenue be called Mayor Ed Koch subway station. She will also announce renaming the street corner there Mayor Edward I. Koch. City officials have introduced legislation to officially rename the station.
