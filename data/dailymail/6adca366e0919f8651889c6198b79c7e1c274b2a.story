Two men have been killed after they jumped from a helicopter and crashed into an alpine field in a BASE jump that went horrifically wrong.

New Zealander Dan Vicary, 33, and Frenchman Ludovic Woerth, 34, were killed in the accident. A third man, whose name and nationality have not been released, was seriously injured.

The jump took place over the Luetschental valley in Bern, Switzerland on Saturday.

The two men were dead by the time rescue workers arrived on the scene.

One of the men killed, Dan Vicary, was a celebrated wingsuit pilot and was ranked No 2 in the world for the sport.

The New Zealander had moved from his native New Zealand to Switzerland, where he ran a BASE jumping supply shop with his wife Lisa Hutchins.

The couple had just celebrated their third wedding anniversary. She paid tribute to her husband, whom she said was ‘amazing human being’

‘Adventure – that is what life was with him. I always told him he lived everyday like someone left the gate open,’ she told Fairfax New Zealand.

Wingsuit jumps, in which people don a suit with fabric between their legs and jump from heights of up to 6,000 feet, sees 20 people die each year

The sport is inherently risking, with approximately 20 people dying while participating in it each year. But Ms Hutchins said he knew the risks and did everything he could to mitigate them.

‘I know he wouldn't change anything.’

Fans of the Vicary, who shared videos of his daring jumps on YouTube, took to social media to share tributes.

‘RIP Dan, fly free,’ was a common epitaph.

‘Happy are the ones who are willing to take the risk to see their dreams come true...Soar on Dan...RIP!’ wrote another.

Wingsuits, sometimes called squirrel suits, are aerodynamically designed jumpsuits, which have fabric between the legs and under the arms to enable the wearer to glide. The jumps end with a parachute opening to allow for a safe landing.

They can cover 3,000 feet in about 30 seconds and often jump from cliffs or aircraft at altitudes of up to 6,500 feet.
