Danny Talbot beat Adam Gemili to win the 200 metres at the Sainsbury’s British Championships and immediately targeted Commonwealth gold, European gold and breaking the 20-second barrier.

For once, this is not typical sprinters’ testosterone-fuelled trash talk, but a genuine possibility.

Talbot is 23 years old and hungry for success, with a point to prove after being overlooked for a place in last year’s World Championship team.

Winning roar: Talbot wants more and is hungry for Commonwealth and European gold

Target: Tablot knows breaking the 20-second barrier in the future is not out of his reach

Talbot is ready to add more honours to the European 200m bronze he won two years ago.

With high-profile Jamaicans such as Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake choosing to skip the individual events in Glasgow, his timing might finally be right.

Talbot’s winning time of 20.42secs may sound unspectacular, but the swirling wind, cool temperatures and rain at Birmingham’s Alexander Stadium made this a race rather than a time-trial and Talbot’s strong final 50m was the difference.

Gemili was second in 20.61secs after stumbling out of his blocks, with James Ellington third in 20.64secs.

Talbot said: ‘I’ve just beaten a world-class field there. It can’t really get much harder than running against a 19-second 200m runner, so if I can beat Adam hopefully I can go on and challenge Christophe Lemaitre and the rest of Europe.

'If one British guy can go sub-20, then I think I can be next.

‘If I win in Zurich (at the European Championships) or at the Commonwealths in Glasgow, all the hard work I’ve put in will actually mean something.’

Ambitious: The eager Talbot says 'if one British guy can go sub-20, then I think I can be next'

Gemili, who ran 19.98secs last season and came fifth in the World Championship final, now has two weeks to run inside the ‘A’ qualifying time of 20.55secs required to reach the European Championships.

Chijindu Ujah qualified fastest for Saturday’s 100m semi-finals by coasting to a 10.26-sec victory in his heat.

Dwain Chambers, bidding for a fifth consecutive British title at the age of 36, won in 10.34secs, while world indoor 60m champion Richard Kilty, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Sean Safo-Antwi all qualified.

Gemili has predicted it will take a sub-10-second performance to win the 100m on Saturday. A bold claim, but with the strength in depth of British sprinting, it pays to set your sights high.

Ready: Talbot already won European 200m bronze two years ago but wants to go further
