Crystal Palace are sweating on the futures of defensive duo Joel Ward and Damien Delaney as the pair stall on new contracts.

The Selhurst Park club have opened talks with both players over fresh deals, but Sportsmail understands agreements are still some distance away.

Ward has established himself as one of the best emerging full-backs in England during his time at the club.

Having played an integral role in keeping the Eagles up last season, Palace are understandably keen for the defender to sign a new long-term deal.

But the 25-year-old, who has been linked with a move to Liverpool, wants to weigh up his options before committing to a new deal.

Ward's contract expires at the end of next season, meaning Palace may look to cash in on the defender in the next two transfer windows if an agreement isn't reached.

Delaney's deal expires at the end of the season and is understood to have offers from the MLS.
