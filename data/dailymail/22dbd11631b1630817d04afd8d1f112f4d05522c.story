The group of friends dressed as chocolate bars and lay on the ground as a Christmas selection pack

Over the years Christmas fancy dress outfits have evolved from novelty jumpers to reindeer onesies.

But this group of friends from Dublin, Ireland, took the task of coming up with a festive outfit to the next level when they donned chocolate bar costumes and became a Cadbury selection box.

The outfits were the group's effort for the '12 Pubs of Christmas' - an annual seasonal pub crawl, which sees revellers dress in festive attire and down a drink in a dozen different bars in the city.

Pictures of the 12 men, two of which had travelled from Australia for the big event, went viral on social media overnight and have had over 350,000 likes on Facebook.

Aaron Johnston, 31, who runs a fitness company, came up with the novel idea over a month ago and set to work putting the plan together.

He told the MailOnline: 'We've been doing the 12 pubs bar crawl every year for the last seven years. 

'It's a group of 12 of us and every year we have a different theme. Last year we went as the nativity and we didn't think we could top that this year and then we came up with this.

'My friend Craig made all the costumes by hand. We all chipped in with a few quid for him to get the material, but it must've taken him a long time to make.'

When the group got together yesterday they posed for pictures, which family and friends posted on the internet before they had even left the house.

Mr Johnston, who was dressed as the Crunchie bar, added: 'When we got into the city centre people were saying to us you're all over Facebook and loads of people wanted pictures.

'We were really surprised with the reaction. Last year we thought we had a great idea and we were saying it's never going to be topped but we put a lot of effort into it.'

They were dressed as everything from a Dairy Milk to a Curly Wurly and made it round all of the 12 designated pubs. 

The group have known each other for several years and Mr Johnston says the event is the time of year they all get together.

'Some of my friends have moved away so most of them come home for Christmas - in fact two of them flew over from Australia and one came over from Canada.

'We're just a group of friends getting together. We go and get a drink in each of the 12 pubs and spend about 30 minutes in them - but it's a really well planned event.'

And instead of waking up with too much of a hangover, Mr Johnston said he was woken up to hundreds of messages on his phone from people who had seen he had gone viral.

Even Cadbury Ireland were impressed and tweeted: 'This has made our day!!! So well made and perfectly modeled :) #SelectionBoxSuits'. 

The 12 Pubs of Christmas has become increasingly popular in the Irish capital and brings with it challenges along the way, including 'left-handed pub' where you can only drink with one hand.

Other tasks might be the 'silent pub' - no talking - and the 'swapsies pub' where the punters have to swap shoes with each other.

But there are concerns from health authorities over the harmful effects of heavy drinking.

Joe Treacy, an accredited counsellor with the Addiction Counsellors of Ireland, told the Connacht Tribune, that people are dicing with death by taking part in the ‘tradition’.

#There are two drinking festivals in Ireland now – St Patrick’s Day and Christmas.

'Go to A&E over the next few weeks and you’ll see an awful lot of Christmas jumpers – head injuries, intoxication, domestic violence, fights. The common factor is alcohol.

“Six hundred people self-harmed [died by suicide] last year and no parent relishes the thought of that. Loading young people with cheap alcohol is a recipe for disaster.'
