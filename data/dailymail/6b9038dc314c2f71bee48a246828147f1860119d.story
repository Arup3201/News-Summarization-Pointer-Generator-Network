Many thought Real Madrid would rest on their Champions League laurels this summer having just won the European Cup but instead they added three big-name signings to their squad. 

Toni Kroos was one of the pass-masters of the World Cup and ended up with a winner's medal; James Rodriguez scored the tournament's best goal, and quite possibly its second best goal too; and in a tournament full of good goalkeeping performances Keylor Navas was the pick of the bunch. 

So, how have Madrid's three World Cup wonders performed in their first three months at the Bernabeu?

James Rodriquez is all set to become a big hit for Real Madrid after signing on the back of a great World Cup

Carlo Ancelotti is deploying former Bayern Munich man Toni Kroos in a deeper role for the La Liga giants

Kroos looked as if he had been in Real Madrid's midfield for the last five years when he made his debut in the European Super Cup against Sevilla at the Cardiff City Stadium back in September and he was outstanding again on Saturday with an almost 100 per cent pass accuracy in the 5-0 win over Levante.

No-one at Real doubts his ability to play the position in the Spanish league – the test will come when the opponent is of a slightly higher quality. Levante gave Kroos time to pick his passes at the weekend and he took full advantage, none more so than when his long pass forward set up Rodriguez's goal.

The other doubt is whether it is the best use of Kroos' talents. At Bayern Munich, Pep Guardiola used him in that position when he turned up but soon decided that he preferred him further forward and turned Philipp Lahm into his midfield holder. 

There are times when Kroos, not unlike Jack Wilshere for England, can't resist a natural tendency to carry the ball forward as opposed to give the quick pass most teams want from their sitting midfielder. 

Kroos is becoming a sturdy constant in the middle of the mark but still has attacking tendencies

Real Madrid do have Asier Illarramendi and Sami Khedira who can play in the middle of the midfield three and that would certainly release Kroos, but Carlo Ancelotti said in midweek: 'I am sure Kroos can play in Xabi's position' so for the time being he looks set to continue there. 

On Saturday he faces any holding midfielder's biggest test with Lionel Messi wandering back from his centre forward starting point to play in the space in front of Real Madrid's back four. We learn a lot about Kroos during those 90 minutes.

Rodriguez has certainly done his job off the pitch. If Real wanted a new pin-up boy then they have hit the jackpot as their £63million star has female fans swooning in the aisles at the Bernabeu as well as in the aisles of the club's superstore next to the stadium where his shirt sales have put him behind only Cristiano Ronaldo in terms of popularity.

On the pitch he has shown the flashes of brilliance that he displayed at the World Cup and that ultimately convinced president Florentino Perez that it would make excellent business sense to move on Angel di Maria (who was now, with some justification, asking to be moved up the club's wage structure) and bring in someone who would accept his salary and, in effect, be paid for by the Argentine's big money switch to Old Trafford.

All that was left to do was to make it work on the pitch. 

Goalkeeper Keylor Navas has seen his opportunities to play limited thanks to Iker Casillas 

Rodriguez has had to do more running back than he would have liked. But he has done it without complaint and there are signs that it now comes a little easier to him than it did in the first few games. He still can't give those long-busting road-runner performances that Di Maria gave, so Ancelotti has instructed Gareth Bale to track back to make a bank of four when Real don't have the ball. 

When Bale didn't play on Saturday and Real lined up with Kroos, Isco, Luka Modric and Rodriguez in midfield the Colombian had greater licence to get forward and gave one of his best performances of the season so far.

Navas hit the jackpot this summer when a wonderful World Cup topped off a stunning season and earned him a move to Real Madrid. A devout Christian, Madrid television captured images of him reading from his bible in the car to the stadium as he turned up for his medical and presentation.

At the moment, however, the man they called San Iker (Saint Iker) stands between Navas and complete nirvana. The captain is clinging on to his first team spot and has looked in excellent domestic form this season - limiting Navas to just one La Liga opportunity.

Navas made three saves and conceded one goal in a 5-1 win against Elche. Most of the action was down the other end of the pitch and when he was tested there was not chance to do anything out of the ordinary. 

Life for a keeper at Madrid can be tough with so little to gain and so much to lose in so many of the games. He will be Real Madrid's Copa del Rey keeper with a last-16 tie against Cornella on December 3 - his first match in the domestic cup competition. 

That will give him the chance to win a trophy and to start pushing Casillas, who it seems he will probably replace as No 1 in all competitions at the start of next season. Barring any Spain vs Slovakia lapses for Casillas in a Madrid shirt though, he will have to be patient.
