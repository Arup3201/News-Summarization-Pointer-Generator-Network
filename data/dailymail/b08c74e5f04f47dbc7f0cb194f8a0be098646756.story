A driver has clocked up a record 45 penalty points on his licence in a nine-month offending spree yet is still on the road, damning new figures reveal today.

The motorist, from Liverpool, got the points for eight offences of either failing to disclose the identity of the driver or for speeding between October 1 2012 and June 20 2013.

His total exceeded the previous record of 42 points according to the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) which obtained figures from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Drivers who get 12 points within three years can be disqualified. But the new figures show that nine drivers have clocked up 30 points or more. And more than 7,000 have 12 points or more.

The new official Government figures have outraged motoring groups and road safety campaigners who say it makes a mockery of penalty points system, bringing it ‘into disrepute’.

They say the ministers at the Department for Transport and Ministry of Justice must act to clamp down on the scandal which is leaving potentially dangerous drivers unpunished on the nation’s roads.

The IAM said poor communication between the Government’s DVLA and the courts - particularly when drivers clocked up repeat points over a short time - and a tendency for courts to take ‘hardship’ stories into account means thousands of drivers are still on the road despite exceeding the 12-point limit.

The figures obtained by the IAM showed:

Failing to give the identity of the owner, speeding, and driving uninsured were the most common reasons for points, said the IAM.

Normally a driver facing 12 points will be subject to an automatic six-month ban - unless they can prove it would cause exceptional hardship. A court decides if a driver is banned or has special reasons to be allowed to stay behind the wheel.

The DVLA said courts can exercise discretion and not disqualify in a small percentage of cases where a driver has accumulated 12 or more points.

Some drivers given points for failing to disclose the driver had argued that a series of different people had test-driven their the car ahead of a sale and they didn’t know who was at the wheel at the time of the offence, said the IAM.

The figures show nine drivers have clocked up 30-plus points. And more than 7,000 have 12 points or more

The issue of who was driving when an offence is committed is controversial and can escalate. 

HM Courts & Tribunals Service say the ‘vast majority’ of drivers who get 12 or more penalty points are fined and disqualified from driving but notes: ‘Magistrates can use their discretion to not enforce a driving ban if doing so would cause exceptional hardship, such as losing a job or the ability to care for a dependant.

A fine will still be enforced. Only a very small number of cases are affected by the data-sharing issue and we are working closely with DVLA to improve this.’

A DVLA spokesman said: ‘The DVLA’s role is to record the information provided by the courts. The courts are able to use their discretion to decide whether or not to disqualify a driver.’
