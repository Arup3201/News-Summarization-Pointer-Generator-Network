Cascading down the hillside burning everything in its path, this is the moment a 'lavafall' breaks over a grassy bank in Hawaii.

Video footage shows three streams of molten rock oozing through the metal fence of a waste recycling facility in Pahoa earlier this week and slowly trickling down - some tributaries blending into one.

As the fiery liquid moves over vegetation, smoke plumes erupt and flames flicker with temperatures hitting close to 2,000-degrees Fahrenheit.

The Big Island is known for having some of world's most beautiful waterfalls but this scene, captured Tuesday, puts a rather hellish spin on things.

Lava began erupting from Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano on June 27.

The flow has traveled more than 13 miles since then and is currently oozing through the rural town of Pahoa, which has around 1,000 residents, destroying cemeteries and homes in its path.  

Kilauea has been erupting continuously for more than 31 years. 

Earlier flows traveled south, smothering the Royal Garden and Kalapana subdivisions in the 1980s and 1990s.

They destroyed more than
180 homes between 1983 and 1990, but until this week, none had
been lost since 2012.
