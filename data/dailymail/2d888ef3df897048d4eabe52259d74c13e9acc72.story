Pope Francis warned the Catholic Church not to close in on itself at a Mass to mark Pentecost Sunday attended by more than 200,000 people.

Addressing a packed St Peter's square, Pope Francis said the
 Church should ask itself daily whether it is resisting new challenges 
and remaining 'barricaded in transient structures which have lost their 
capacity for openness to what is new.'

The Pentecost Mass celebrates the day the 
Church says the Holy Spirit descended on Christ's apostles, or 
disciples, and is regarded as the birthday of the Church.

'Newness always makes us a bit fearful, because we feel more secure if we have everything under control,' Francis said in his homily.

He added that change can bring fulfillment.

Francis warned of the threat of an 
institution which is 'self-referential, closed in on herself,' and spoke
 of the courage to 'take to the streets of the world" and reach "the 
very outskirts of existence'.

Later he toured the square in an open-top white vehicle, greeting cheering crowds and kissing young children.

At a vigil on Saturday evening, Francis said Catholics must become courageous and seek out the people who need help the most rather than sitting around, dissecting theology.
