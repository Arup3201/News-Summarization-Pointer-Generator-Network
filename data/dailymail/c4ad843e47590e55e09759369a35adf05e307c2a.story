Jonathan Goldsmith, AKA 'The Most Interesting Man In The World', is selling his luxury yacht for $200,000

A yacht belonging to veteran TV actor Jonathan Goldsmith, who recently found fame as the 'Most Interesting Man In The World', is up for grabs for $200,000.

Goldsmith, 74, has appeared in more than 45 television series over his 60 years in showbusiness, but is now a famous face thanks to the successful comedic adverts for Dos Equis, a Mexican beer.

He put his 47-foot yacht on the market with Heritage Yacht Sales for $199,950, according to TMZ.

It is a 2003 Beneteau located in Long Beach, California, and includes a master room with en-suite bath, guest room with bath, kitchen, two flat screen TVs and a stereo system.

The Dos Equis ads feature the ruggedly handsome Goldsmith, speaking with a deep Hispanic accent, in a series of ludicrous settings that make him look effortlessly cool - such as rescuing a bear from a trap or bench pressing two women in a casino.

Meanwhile a voice-over lists his grandiose feats and achievements, such as 'Even his enemies list him as their emergency contact number' and 'His cereal never gets soggy. It sits there, staying crispy, just for him'.

Others include 'His words carry weight that would break a less interesting man's jaw' and 'He is a lover not a fighter, but he is also a fighter so donâ€™t get any ideas'.

The campaign has been credited for helping to fuel a 15.4 per cent sales increase for the brand in America in 2009.
