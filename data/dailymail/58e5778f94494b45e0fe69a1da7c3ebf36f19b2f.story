Dozens of Bay Area residents started their day Friday the extraterrestrial way: by watching a bright, mysterious object shoot across the early morning sky.

Unlike a meteor or a plane, most witnesses said the unidentified object appeared to be spraying something in its wake.

However, CBS San Francisco notes that mosquito fogging isn't done by air in the area. And officials from a nearby Air Force base aren't letting on that they know what the object was, either.

Shooting star? Dozens of Bay Area residents started their day Friday the extraterrestrial way: by watching a bright, mysterious object shoot across the early morning sky

Space debris? Air Force officials say there was no missile test Friday. Some believe it could be a bit of space debris

'About 6 am this morning, I came out, I was walkingdown the driveway and I looked up at the sky and saw this little orange ball – above the Redwood trees,' Novato resident Barry Formslag told KPIX.

Formslag was among the residents of Oregon, Northern California and Nevada who witnessed the eerie occurrence.

An official from the Chabot Space and ScienceCenter in Oakland told KPIX: 

'We’re thinking maybe it was either a piece of space junk that has fallen out of orbit and into our atmosphere or it might have been some kind of a missile test launch.'

However, there had been no missile launched from the Vandenberg Air Force Base.

Only one or two photos appear to have emerged from the incident. The Claycord resident who snapped them told Claycord New & Talk: 

'This morning at 6am I saw this white light while facing West. Varying brightness and then fizzled out. Is it a missile? Is it a meteorite? Maybe somebody will now (sic) what it is.'

Thus far, no firm explanation has been found for the strange streak.
