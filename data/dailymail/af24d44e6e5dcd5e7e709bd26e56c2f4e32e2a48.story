Manchester United centre back Marcos Rojo got into the festive spirits with his family as he posted a picture of him, his partner and daughter in front of their Christmas tree.

Louis van Gaal got an early present when the the 24-year-old recently returned to full fitness for United.

Rojo dislocated his shoulder against Manchester City at the beginning of November.

It was initally featred that Rojo could be out for up to six weeks, compounding United's dreadful list of injuries this season.

The Argentine, however, made a quicker than expected recovery has been a rock in United's defence in recent weeks.

Rojo lined up in a defensive back three with Chris Smalling and Paddy McNair as Van Gaal's side ground out a 2-1 victory over Southampton at St Mary's on Monday.

The versatile left-hander will need to bring his best form as United welcome Liverpool to Old Trafford on Sunday as Van Gaal's side look to continue their march up the Premier League table.
