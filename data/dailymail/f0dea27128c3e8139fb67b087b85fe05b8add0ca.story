Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud could be disciplined by the Football Association after headbutting Queen Park Rangers' Nedum Onuoha during the Premier League clash at the Emirates Stadium.

Giroud was shown a red card by Martin Atkinson after he appeared to move his head in the direction of his opponent during the 53rd minute. 

Straight dismissals in the Premier League usually carry an automatic three-match ban, however the incident could be investigated further by the FA.

Giroud will definitely miss his side's next three games against West Ham, Southampton and Hull. 

He has already missed a large chunk of the season due to an injury he picked up against Everton on August 23.

The Arsenal striker's dismissal did not prove to be costly as the home side went on to win 2-1. 

Arsene Wenger said after the match that his fellow countryman's red card was 'deserved'. 

He said: ‘It was deserved. He did not control himself. It changed the dynamic of the game, we were in complete control up until that point.

‘I will be having a word with him. Olivier is a guy who stands up and takes responsibility when he has done wrong.’

Tomas Rosicky, who made his first Premier League appearance since October 25, said: 'I think he knows what he has done. When I was substituted I went to the dressing room for a while and he knows he made a big mistake. He has to learn from it.'

Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright, speaking on BT Sport, added: ‘I think Giroud will be very, very relieved. I don’t think QPR did enough until the end of the game to get a result.

‘I have looked at it from every angle and I cannot understand why  Giroud was so angry to hit out like that.

‘Arsene knows it has come at a time when Arsenal were quite comfortable and on top. So it was crucial for them to get a second goal.’
