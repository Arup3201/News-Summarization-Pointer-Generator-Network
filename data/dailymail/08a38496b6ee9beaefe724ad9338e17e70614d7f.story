After the birth of the future King last night, the well-wishers who had waited outside St Mary's Hospital were understandably keen to give their opinions on the happy news.

But one Royal fan decided to offer up a tasteless joke when he was interviewed live on Sky News about the announcement that the Duchess of Cambridge had given birth.

The man said that that William and Kate's baby was a 'black boy' - leaving presenter Kay Burley speechless with shock as bystanders grinned awkwardly.

Shock: This man said on Sky News that Kate had given birth to 'a black boy', stunning bystanders

Awkward: The presenter and other members of the crowd were left speechless by the man

The surreal moment came about half an hour after the birth was announced at 8.30 last night.

Ms
Burley, who has been on camera almost non-stop since the Duchess first 
went into labour early yesterday morning, was asking members of the 
public for their reaction to the news.

After
one Royal supporter standing outside the hospital in Paddington, 
central London, said she 'was hoping for a boy', the presenter moved on 
to a man wearing glasses.

However, he shocked Ms Burley and others present by saying: 'The news is, it's a black boy.'

Stunned: Kay Burley did not know how to respond to the man's extraordinary comment

She had no comeback to the joke, and a nervous silent took over the entire crowd nearby.

After an awkward few seconds, Ms Burley moved on to another well-wisher, who repeated the congratulations expressed by most of the bystanders.

The identity of the man is currently unknown.

Twitter users reacted with amusement to the bizarre gaffe, with most characterising it as 'hilarious' and 'random'.

The moment was a rare flash of excitement in the rolling television news coverage of the Royal birth, which has mostly been characterised by extended expert comment and interviews with the public.
