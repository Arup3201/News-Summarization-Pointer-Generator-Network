As temperatures plummet, hats are the fashion must-have. But is slinging on a bobble hat as effortless as Victoria Beckham makes it look? How do you know if Rosie Huntington-Whiteley’s fedora will suit your face? And who can carry off pompoms? Mandie Gower, a 38-year-old mother of two, road-tested the hottest styles to find out. 

TRENDY BEANIE

Pompom beanie, £10, very.co.uk

I’ve seen so many people wearing bobble hats that I’m convinced they must suit everyone. Heck, even Victoria Beckham relaxed her cocktail-party-ready style to endorse the trend.

Her grey felt bobble number whispered laid-back luxury, and there’s no doubt I could do with a bit of that on the school run.

Yet my first thought is ‘tea cosy’. My second, ‘Well, now I know what I’d look like bald’. I think the bobble is best left to the oval or oblong faces. Mine is just too round.

Am I too old for this look? Well, if you look like you might have knitted it yourself, it’s one to avoid.

SUPER CHIC BERET

Within seconds of trying the beret, I realise that there’s no right way to wear it.

Pinch it to one side for a classic French look, plonk it on the back of your head, or pull it over your ears when it’s really cold. It’s one of the few hats that suits cropped styles as well as longer tresses, as it will always reveal some hair, and it’s refreshingly low maintenance; at the cinema, I simply roll it up and stick it in my bag. It’s hard to imagine a time when the beret won’t seem chic. And at just £15, it’s a great investment.

CUDDLY COSSACK

The Russians know a thing or two about bone-chilling winters, so where better to take inspiration now that biting Arctic temperatures and snow have arrived on our shores?

The Cossack sits securely on my head, covers my ears, and heats me up faster than an electric blanket.

It also goes with everything — transforming my scruffy Puffa cover-up to something that could grace Klosters ski slopes.

Even better, it’s one of those rare finds that looks equally appropriate whether your style icon is Cressida, Camilla or, erm, the Queen.

FABULOUSLY FLOPPY

Burgundy floppy hat, £20, asos.com

A good option for long, oblong faces, which sadly precludes me. A pity, because I can imagine swooshing around the shops in this with a poncho — it feels playful and on-trend. The brim is cleverly cut to give coy glimpses of your eyes without compromising your vision. Fifteen years ago I’d have played up the Seventies vibe with a maxi dress, but now I’d stick to a leather jacket.

Would I wear it in another 15 years? Probably not — I fear it would look too ‘girly’.

BRIMMING WITH STYLE 

Wide-brimmed hat, £28,  riverisland.com 

The widebrim  hat is  guaranteed to turn heads, so you won’t be surprised to learn that Kim Kardashian is a fan. I love the drama of it, I love the suits everyone but under-used grey/blue colour. However, I can’t figure out when I would wear one. It would take only the slightest puff of wind to send it into orbit. That said, you’d make an impressive entrance at a party —  but one where you didn’t want to talk to anyone, as the brim constantly flops.

CLASSIC CLOCHE

Navy cloche hat, £49, jacques-vert.co.uk

Say cloche hat, and I envisage ingenue types like Audrey Tautou — big, wide eyes peering up innocently from low-riding brims — both dramatic and demure. Yet the image in the mirror isn’t alluring; it’s me in my dotage.

The heavy brim shrouds my face and the cloche’s dome shape pushes down on my eyes.

I daren’t go into the Post Office in case they offer me my pension. Never mind asking ‘am I too old for this?’ Everyone is too young to wear this. Still tempted? Ask yourself ‘Am I a Downton Abbey dowager in a funeral scene?’ If the answer’s no, move on.

CHEEKY TRILBY 

Grey felt trilby, £39, jigsaw-online.com

This style of hat is the equivalent of a provocatively arched eyebrow, and Jigsaw’s trilby is a cheeky little number. At first glance the grey tweed and classic shape seem as British as a pinstripe suit, but when I pop it on, it’s quite the attention seeker. The stiff, curved brim makes it impossible to wear at anything but a jaunty angle, and peering out from under it at my builder feels downright flirty. In fact, I reckon it would help you sail past the snootiest of doormen. And unlike some of the other styles, it requires zero fiddling.

FUNKY FEDORA 

Pale pink fedora, £25, marksandspencer.com

This could be my secret weapon on bad wardrobe days. A fedora seems to work with everything and everyone, you just need a little attitude to pull it off. I love the way the wide brim elongates round and heartshaped faces like mine, not to mention how the blush pink colour flatters almost every skintone. The secret to wearing it is simple — you just plonk it straight on. As it frames my face so well, I’d be reluctant to wear it without make-up. And the shallow crown encourages good  posture — I immediately stand taller. Just don’t forget to pull your hair forward to avoid your ears poking out like elves from The Lord Of The Rings.
