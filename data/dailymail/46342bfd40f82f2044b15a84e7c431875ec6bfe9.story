The younger brother of Germany World Cup hero Mario Gotze has followed in his sibling’s footsteps by signing for Bayern Munich from Borussia Dortmund.

Mario – scorer of the winning goal in Sunday’s World Cup final against Argentina – sparked controversy when he quit Dortmund in a £30million move to Bayern 12 months ago.

And now 16-year-old Felix has joined the German champions.

Red star: And now Gotze's younger brother, Felix, is set to join him at Bayern Munich

‘He has joined us, that's right,’ Bayern's head of youth Michael Tarnat told Sport Bild.

Felix will play for Bayern’s under-17 side, which is coached by Heiko Herrlich, who was part of Dortmund’s 1997 Champions League-winning team.

Mario and Felix's older brother, 24-year-old Fabian, is also a former Dortmund player but now plays for SpVgg Unterhaching in the German third tier.
