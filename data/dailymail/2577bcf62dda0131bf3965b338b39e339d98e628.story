Australian researchers have created a ‘super horse’ with 3D printed titanium shoes they say could give racehorses a major advantage.

The horse, nicknamed ‘Titanium Prints’, had its hooves scanned with a handheld 3D scanner.

Using 3D modelling software, the scan was then used to design the perfect fitting, lightweight racing shoe.

Here, researcher Chad Henry presents 'Titanium Prints' the 'super horse' with its new 3D printed shoes. The researchers behind the project believe the bespoke horseshoes say could give racehorses a major advantage

Four customised shoes were printed within only a few hours and experts say the technology could give horses a major advantage on the track.

Traditionally made from aluminium, a horseshoe can weigh up to one kilogram but the horse’s trainer, John Moloney, says that the ultimate race shoe should be as lightweight as possible.

'Any extra weight in the horseshoe will slow the horse down,' he said.

To make the shoes pictured, which are half the weight of aluminium horseshoes, the horse's hooves were scanned and digital 3D models made. From these models the custom-made titanium horseshoes were printed

'These titanium shoes could take up to half of the weight off a traditional aluminium shoe, which means a horse could travel at new speeds.

'We’re very excited at the prospect of improved performance from these shoes.'

The precision scanning process takes just a few minutes and for a horse, shoes can be made to measure each hoof and printed the same day.

The project by Australia’s National Science Agency, CSIRO, was developed to show off a new 3D printing technique invented by the team.

Could horse races be faster in the future? Horse trainer John Moloney said the titanium shoes could take up to half of the weight off a traditional aluminium shoe, which means a horse could travel at new speeds. Here, three horses with normal shoes race at Curragh last month

John Barnes, Titanium Technologies Leader at CSIRO said: 'There are so many ways we can use 3D titanium printing. At CSIRO we are helping companies create new applications like biomedical implants and even things like automotive and aerospace parts.'

'The possibilities really are endless with this technology.'

He said that 3D printing a race horseshoe from titanium is a first for scientists and demonstrates the range of applications the technology can be used for.
