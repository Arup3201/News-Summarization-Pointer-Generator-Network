An entrepreneur, who is well-known for charity fundraising, has been charged with fraud after stealing $214,000 from his 94-year-old grandmother with dementia, authorities said.

Bill Young and his wife Karen were accused of spending thousands of dollars at Macy's, Pottery Barn for Kids, Costco, Netflix, Amazon and AT&T. They were also accused of using the money to fund a trip to Las Vegas in 2009.

The scam was uncovered by other members 
of the family when Bill Young from Denver, Colorado, dropped into conversation that he would 
have to cut back on the elderly woman's living expenses.

Young has power-of-attorney over his grandmother's wealth, according to an affidavit seen by 9News.

They had also apparently used the money to fund businesses, writing checks from her account for their ventures.

An attorney for the family had police obtain a search warrant and go over the couple's home last year.

Their lawyer Susanne Rogers told 9 News 
that her clients had done nothing wrong and that all the outgoing costs were related to the care of the 94-year-old.

She said: 'I can't wait for this case to get started so the rest of the evidence can come out.'

Young runs a motivational website, called billyounginspires.com where he offers his skills as a consultant to help charities raise money.

It states that 'only one thing will fuel your growth: Money.'

According to the website, Bill Young is also the author of two books and sits on the boards for various organizations including a hospital and children's center.

The Westminster Police Department in Colorado said he is not allowed to leave the state under the terms of his bond.
