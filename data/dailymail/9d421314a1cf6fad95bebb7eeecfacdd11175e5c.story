When Caroline Cartwright, from Tyne and Wear, gets into bed with husband Steve, sleeping is usually the last thing on her mind.

But while Mrs Cartwright and her husband of 38 years enjoy their time in the sack, neighbours have been left fuming after being forced to endure years of banging sounds and screaming.

30 visits from the police later, the 53-year-old was slapped with a four-year ASBO and even endured a 12-week jail term. But, she says, she has no regrets - and no plans to stop.

No regrets: Caroline Cartwright has no regrets, despite being hit with an ASBO for having noisy sex

'If you get to a point where the bed's banging on the wall, you're not going to stop, are you?' she laughs.

'As far as I'm concerned, that's what you should be doing. Just relax. Go with the flow. It's not as if I'm having sex and think: "Oh, I'm making too much noise. I better be quiet".'

Mrs Cartwright's problems began when she and her husband moved into a quiet terrace of Victorian homes in Tyne and Wear.

Their bedroom backed onto a neighbour's but the couple, who will appear on Channel 5's ASBO and Proud documentary, chose to splash out on a bed with an iron headboard anyway.

Complaints from irate locals soon began to flood in but it wasn't just the headboard that annoyed neighbours - Mrs Cartwright's habit of screaming loudly during the act also proved a problem.

'It was a different bed from the one we have now,' she says, unrepentantly. 'We broke that one. It was a metal headboard so it used to bang on the wall.'

Banned: Caroline is not allowed to shout, scream or vocalise during regular sex sessions with husband Steve

'There was no carpet back then, so when you have sex, the bed goes back and forward,' adds Mr Cartwright, who describes the complaints as 'silliness'.

Finally, after scores of visits from the police, Mrs Cartwright was handed a noise abatement order - later upgraded to an ASBO after she breached the order five times.

The ASBO forbade her from 'shouting, screaming and vocalisation' during sex or from playing loud music. 

In a bid to get around the restrictions, Mrs Cartwright, who is unemployed,  switched her sex sessions to the morning - but neighbours, who complained she was noisy enough to drown out their TVs, were left unimpressed.

'I wasn't supposed to make excessive noise that could be heard in a neigbouring property or outside,' she explains. 'As soon as I got it, I said to them [the police]: "I guess I'm going to get arrested then".'

She duly was. 'I think we were having sex when they came to arrest me,' she remembers. 'I think we'd just finished,' adds husband Steve.

Misery: Rachel O'Connor is one of the neighbours whose life was made a misery by the Cartwright's noisy nocturnal antics

'The lads in blue were knocking on the door and I let them in and they asked me what we were doing,' he continues. 'And I said we were having sex in our own house.'

'When we got to the police station, the [policeman] said: "We're going to have to stop laughing now we're going in",' adds Mrs Cartwright. 'They were all trying not to laugh.'

What followed, however, was no laughing matter. Mrs Cartwright was taken to court, handed an eight-week suspended prison sentence and was forced to live in a bail hostel for weeks.

A year later, and after scores more complaints and visits from the police, Mrs Cartwright was again arrested for breaching her ASBO following two police call outs in two days.

Again, she was handed a suspended sentence, this time for 12 weeks, and sent to live in a bail hostel where she was held alongside serious criminals, including murderers.

It proved an interesting experience. 'I would have been judgmental about people who went to prison before I got locked up,' she explains.

'But then you go in there and you hear the stories of why they're there, it makes you realise that it could be anyone who ends up there.'

But despite her convictions, Mrs Cartwright, who has since bought a less noisy wooden bed, remains adamant that she's done nothing wrong. 'I don't see why I should stop having sex in my own house with my husband of 38 years,' she complains.

'I'm sure there could be a lot worse things I could be doing. They all thought it was stupid I was in prison. 

'I mean I was in the same prison as people like Rose West for making a noise when I have sex. There could be a real crime going on while they're busy arresting me.'
