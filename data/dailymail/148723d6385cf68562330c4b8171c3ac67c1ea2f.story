The BBC is planning to tell the story of Easter this year with a spectacular live show using a giant cross made from shipping containers.

The hour-long flagship programme on Good Friday is aiming to appeal to non-religious viewers who are put off by church services.

It will be broadcast from South Shields in Tyne and Wear and use up to 80 containers representing the Stations of the Cross.

Up to 80 shipping containers will be used for the BBC's Easter spectacle - a retelling of the Easter story

The containers will be brought together to create a huge, cross-shaped installation, helping worshippers and viewers to better understand The Passion, including Christ’s trial, suffering and death.

The scale of the cross, which will be 
longer than St Paul's Cathedral, is intended to replicate the length of 
the path trodden by Christ on the way to his crucifixion.

The show, called The Great North Passion, will include a live church service and a choral performance at King's College chapel in Cambridge.

Aaqil Ahmed, the corporation's head of religion, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'It is an event to mark the story for a wider audience who may not necessarily watch the actual religious services.

'The Easter services will be primarily aimed at a religious audience. We should get something for everybody in there.'

For the past few years, the BBC has staged Passion plays in outside settings with the involvement of local communities.

In 2006, actor and singer Keith Allen 
played Pontius Pilate in the Manchester Passion, while in the Preston 
Passion, in 2012, the role was taken by Miranda comedy star Tom Ellis.

That
 programme, which was presented by Fern Britton and included a 
performance by Jamelia, the soul singer, was watched by more than one 
million viewers.

Councillor Alan 
Kerr, deputy leader of South Tyneside Council, said: 'We are delighted 
and proud to host this national event in South Tyneside.

'The BBC took into consideration our excellent track record in hosting and staging major events like the Great North Run and our summer festival concerts.

'The Great North Passion producers realised Bents Park is the perfect venue for such a live broadcast.

'Our experienced event staff are used to providing logistical support for major events, and the BBC were impressed by their ‘can do' attitude.

'We are already working very hard with The Cultural Spring and the BBC to ensure the Great North Passion will be a success, and it's great to think the eyes of the nation will again be on the borough for a major national event.'

Among the dozens of shipping containers used for the programme will be one for each of the 14 stations of the cross, which traditionally mark the final moments before Christ's crucifixion.

Before being transported to South Shields to form part of the final installation they will be placed, for about two months, in different areas across the North East to be developed into 'pieces of art'.

Starting from next month, the BBC wants to transform the containers into 'contemporary original works', each reflecting the themes of individual stations of the cross.

It is commissioning artists, dancers, musicians, poets and writers to take responsibility for a single container and to develop it with the involvement of local communities.

The broadcaster is working with the Cultural Spring, a scheme that helps young people get involved in arts projects in Sunderland and South Tyneside.

Rebecca Ball, project director for the Cultural Spring, added: 'We’re delighted to be working with the BBC on the Great North Passion; a fantastic free event in Bents Park, South Shields, that will also be enjoyed by millions on TV on Good Friday.

'The Cultural Spring was set up to ensure as many people as possible from South Tyneside and Sunderland get to see, take part in, create and enjoy great arts projects.

'What better way to launch our three-year programme than with this fantastic partnership with the BBC.'
