Harvard University basketball co-captain Kyle Casey plans to withdraw from school and is likely to miss an entire season amid a cheating scandal that also may involve other athletes, according to several reports.

Sports Illustrated and the Harvard Crimson reported Tuesday that Casey, a senior credited with helping his team advance to the NCAA tournament for the first time in 65 years, would take a leave of absence from school in an attempt to preserve a year of eligibility once the issue is resolved.

Co-captain Brandyn Curry also has been implicated in the scandal and is weighing his options, his father told the magazine. The Boston Herald reported Curry also is expected to withdraw from classes.

A source indicated that another unnamed basketball player with a smaller role on the team could be involved as well, the Boston Herald.

The school is looking into whether at least 125 undergraduates in Government 1310: Introduction to Congress, a spring 2012 class with an enrollment of 279 cheated by collaborating on answers for a take-home final exam.

The students implicated in the scandals are facing charges of academic dishonesty that could carry a one-year suspension from school. School officials have declined to release the students' names.

‘These allegations, if proven, represent totally unacceptable behavior that betrays the trust upon which intellectual inquiry at Harvard depends,’ President Drew Faust said when the cheating scandal was uncovered in August.

Each student whose work is in question has been called to appear before a subcommittee of the Harvard College Administrative Board, which reviews issues of academic integrity. Possible punishments range from an admonition, a sort of warning for a first offense, to being forced to withdraw from Harvard for a year.

According to Sports Illustrated sources, Casey had the option of enrolling for the fall 2012 semester and fighting the cheating allegations, but risked losing his final season of Ivy League eligibility if the administrative board ruled against him. 

By withdrawing for the season, the standout forward may be readmitted to Harvard in 2013-14.

Harris emphasized that none of the allegations has been proven and said there's no evidence of widespread cheating at Harvard.

The Crimson reported that other athletes, including football players are also among those implicated, which may result in changes to the team’s line-up.

Hartford spokesman Tim Williamson 
declined to comment on Tuesday. Messages seeking comment also were left 
for Harvard basketball coach Tommy Amaker, football coach Tim Murphy, 
Curry and Casey.

Successful season: Casey and Currey helped the Crimson advance to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1946 last year

Harvard is coming off Ivy League 
championships in both football and basketball, where the Crimson made 
their first trip to the NCAA tournament since 1946 last season, going 
26-4 under Amaker.

The six-foot-seven Casey averaged more than 11 points per game, a team high and more than five rebounds. Curry averaged almost eight points a game.

Amaker, a former Duke star, came to Harvard in 2007 from Michigan, where he was charged with cleaning up that program after years of scandal.

The Crimson, citing an email it obtained from John Ellison, the Secretary of the Administrative Board, said athletes involved were being asked to weigh potential Ivy League eligibility issues when deciding whether or not to remain on campus for the fall term.

Typically, if a player takes part in athletic competition before being asked to take a leave of absence by the board, the player loses a full season of Ivy League eligibility, the newspaper reported.

‘Fall-term athletes may also want to consider taking (a leave) before their first game,’ Ellison wrote in the email, according to the Crimson.

Harvard, which was poised to repeat its success from last year, is likely to have a tough time replacing Casey, who was the team’s only established interior player, as well as Curry, who is the sole experienced player on the roster.
