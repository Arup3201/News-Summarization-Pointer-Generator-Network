A 161-foot multimillion-dollar superyacht called the Rockstar became pinned under a drawbridge neat Bay Harbour Islands in Florida Tuesday afternoon.

The boat, which costs more than $250,000 to charter for a week, was carrying a group of 15 people at the time, but everyone escaped unharmed.

The yacht was being towed by a pair of tugboats Tuesday from Fort Lauderdale to Miami when the east part of the broad causeway drawbridge connecting North Miami with Harbor Islands and Bal Harbor collapsed.

Epic fail: A 161-foot luxury superyacht became trapped beneath a drawbridge in Florida Tuesday afternoon 

Smashed: The east part of the broad causeway drawbridge connecting North Miami with Harbor Islands and Bal Harbor collapsed onto the top portion of the vessel  

Snagged: The Rockstar remained trapped for more than 20 minutes before it finally became dislodged

Serious damage: The crash, which impacted the top part of the yacht near the hot tub, caused thousands of dollars in damage 

The bridge came down on the top part of the yacht next to the hot tub, destroying part of the roof and causing tens of thousands of dollars in damage, according to the news site WTSP.

The Rockstar remained trapped for more than 20 minutes before it finally became dislodged and was towed away.

The impressive vessel, built by Trinity Yachts in 2009 and registered out of George Town, Cayman Island, features five staterooms, a two-level master suite with a private lounge, his and her bathrooms and 280 degree views over the ocean.

The luxury party boat also boasts a saloon and dining room lined with black and white photos of classic Hollywood film stars, and a seven-person spa pool.

Tragedy averted: Fifteen people were aboard the yacht at the time, but no one was hurt in the collision with the bridge 

On its way: The yacht was being towed by a pair of tugboats Tuesday from Fort Lauderdale to Miami when disaster struck 

The yacht, which was originally named Blind Date, is currently up for sale on boatinternational.com by International Yacht Collection with an asking price of just under $21million.

In the aftermath of the dramatic crash, the drawbridge remained closed to traffic for several hours as city engineers conducted a safety inspection to make sure the structure was sound.

CBS Miami reported that the 60-year-old broad causeway is expected to undergo a $13million renovation beginning in January, which will include replacing parts of the drawbridge mechanism.

The cause of the yacht-drawbridge collision is being investigated.

'We’re not sure of what collided with what yet,' US Coast Guard spokesman Mark Barney told the Miami Herald.
