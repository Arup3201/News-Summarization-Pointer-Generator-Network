Comedian Jack Whitehall is facing the axe as the presenter of a prize at the National Television Awards following the growing controversy over his lewd behaviour on a Channel 4 panel game.

The star has been booked for the ITV show to be broadcast later this month, but it has emerged that a key figure on the programme believes he should not now appear on the awards show.

Channel 4 yesterday ignored the protests of viewers and said the Big Fat Quiz of the Year 2012 – which featured vile jokes about the Queen and Susan Boyle – will be repeated unedited on the main channel tomorrow.

It also aired on one of the 
broadcaster’s other channels in the early hours of yesterday. This 
emerged as it was revealed that complaints to Ofcom and the broadcaster 
had now reached 165.

At least 80 viewers have complained to
 Ofcom about the show, which featured puerile sexual jokes and innuendo 
just minutes after the 9pm watershed. Some 85 have complained directly 
to Channel 4.

The complaints centre around a string 
of offensive jokes from Whitehall and James Corden who were drinking red
 wine and appeared to be drunk by the end of the two hour show on 
Sunday.

Targets of their humour included the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, sprinter Usain Bolt, Barack Obama and singer Miss Boyle.

The programme, presented by the 
controversial comedian Jimmy Carr, was pre-recorded and cleared for 
broadcast by lawyers at Channel 4.

Last night co-executive producer of 
the National Television Awards, George Mitchell, said he would be having
 a ‘summit conference’ on Monday about whether Whitehall should still 
present a prize at the awards.

Mr Mitchell said the controversy could
 ‘run and run’ and his view was that it would be better if Whitehall 
waited for the situation to ‘die down’.

He said he would like to offer him the
 chance to ‘bow out gracefully’ and ‘give him the chance to withdraw’. 
But he admitted other bosses on the show may not agree with him.

A spokesman for the awards last night said the comedian had been booked and would be presenting an award as planned.

Conservative MP Conor Burns, a member 
of the Commons Culture Select Committee, has written to Channel 4 bosses
 demanding to know why the decision was made to broadcast the quiz so 
soon after the watershed.

It emerged yesterday that another 
festive Channel 4 show – The 50 Funniest Moments of 2012 – also 
triggered complaints after it included footage of a male far-Right Greek
 politician punching a woman in the face and strong swearing just after 
the watershed.

Some 40 viewers contacted Ofcom about 
the programme, most of them angry at the suggestion that a woman being 
punched in the face was funny.

Targeted: The Queen (left) and the Duke of Edinburgh (right) were the subject of lewd jokes on the programme

Mentioned: Singer Susan Boyle (left) and U.S. President Barack Obama (right) were targets of the humour

Viewers described the decision to keep 
the item as ‘brainless’ and ‘horrible’.

Ofcom said it was assessing  complaints on both shows but had not launched an investigation at this point.

'If
 Channel 4 are going to repeat this show after there were so many 
complaints about the first broadcast what is the point of the complaints
 system?'

A spokesman at Channel 4 confirmed the
 repeat broadcasts of the Big Fat Quiz of the Year were going ahead as 
planned, stating that they would be preceded by a warning about strong 
language and adult humour.

Last night Margaret Morrissey of the campaign
 group Parents Outloud demanded to know why Channel 4 hadn’t taken the 
complaints of viewers into consideration.

She said: ‘If Channel 4 are going to 
repeat this show after there were so many complaints about the first 
broadcast what is the point of the complaints system?’

The show is due 
to be repeated tomorrow at 11.35pm on the main channel and was broadcast
 on 4seven in the early hours of yesterday. It will be shown in a 
similar slot on Tuesday.

Jokes: Usain Bolt (pictured at the London 2012 Olympic Games last August) was also targeted in the quiz

Questions: MP Conor Burns, a member of the Commons Culture Select Committee, has written to Channel 4 demanding to know why the decision was made to broadcast the quiz so soon after the watershed

Former Gavin and Stacey star Corden, 
34, and Marlborough-educated Whitehall, 24, were seen drinking red wine 
during the show and host Carr commented that they had drunk a bottle 
each.

Their behaviour was egged on by 
Jonathan Ross, 52, who lost his job with the BBC for his role in abusive
 phone calls to the veteran actor Andrew Sachs during a radio show.

'Putting it out at primetime was totally inappropriate. Children are far more likely to be watching at 9pm, especially when you consider it was the Christmas holiday'

Vivienne Pattison, Mediawatch UK

Vivienne Pattison of Mediawatch UK 
said: ‘This programme should have always been broadcast in the late 
night 11.35pm slot. Putting it out at primetime was totally 
inappropriate.

'Children are far more likely to be watching at 9pm, 
especially when you consider it was the Christmas holiday.’

Mark Price, a non-executive member of 
the Channel 4 board yesterday said he had not seen the broadcast. He 
said: ‘The board don’t make creative decisions. That is for the creative
 team to do.’

The chief executive of Channel 4 David Abraham was 
unavailable for comment.
