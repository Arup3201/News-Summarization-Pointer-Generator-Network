Brutal, utterly brutal. If Jose Mourinho’s dismissive pre-match comments about Roberto di Matteo’s glorious achievements seemed a little unkind then this was worse, much worse.

And how Mourinho will have savoured it because here was a performance to encapsulate the point he had been trying to make.

Winning the Champions League is all very well, he seemed to say on the eve of the game, but as a manager you can fluke it with a few good players and a bit of luck.

Building a powerful team, however, one capable of dominating over time and bulldozing all before them? That is a different matter. Mourinho has the ability and he knows it. He has demonstrated it before and he is well on the way to repeating it.

Smug? Perhaps, but this Chelsea team is something to be smug about. They are clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League and into the last 16 of the Champions League as Group G winners.

Fluent and mobile, last night they tore Di Matteo’s Schalke to shreds with goals from John Terry, Willian, Didier Drogba, Ramires and an own goal — all while barely conceding a chance. ‘Very impressive, very complete,’ purred Mourinho.

‘Top quality football for 90 minutes. Very compact, very strong defensively, no mistakes. The team was so solid. Everything under control and the result is a consequence of one team that played a fantastic match.”

Within the brutality there was beauty, the manager wanted to stress. ‘The players are very serious,’ he said. ‘Everything they do with big focus and ambition, but at the same time with this component which is something new in Chelsea football: this happiness, this flair, this beauty. The way they are doing things, we are very happy.’

For Di Matteo it must have been agony. From the moment Terry opened the scoring with a back-post header from a second-minute corner, the outcome was barely in question. At 1-0 Schalke’s Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting hit the bar from long range but after that the Londoners stretched the lead.

Schalke were diabolical in defence, listless in attack and booed and whistled by their own fans, which only made them more anxious.

The songs of support from Chelsea’s travelling support will have done little to ease the pain and humiliation for Di Matteo against the club he served so successfully as player and manager.

‘We are sorry for this performance,’ said Di Matteo. ‘We showed them too much respect. We weren’t aggressive enough, we didn’t put enough pressure on them, and they were ice cold. It was a super, clinical performance from them. We conceded too much space and they have players able to exploit that.’

By the end the Italian must have wished his technical area would open up and swallow him. Or that he had delayed his return to management until after this game.

‘The best comfort they can have is that they lost to the best team,’ said Mourinho. ‘They must be very sad with this result, but my experience tells me that when we lose against a team that is much better, then you have to accept it. It was not their fault. Move on, win the next match and keep going.’

That is the way Chelsea are going about their season.

Unbeaten for 19 games in all competitions, they have not lost since April. Next up: another former Blues favourite, Gus Poyet, at Sunderland, who will tremble if he studies this game too closely.

Chelsea’s second goal, from Willian, followed an exquisite move featuring Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas, although goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann ought to have done better with the shot.

The third crushed Schalke before the interval when Jan Kirchhoff headed into his own goal from another Fabregas corner. There was no yellow Chelsea shirt near Kirchhoff as he planted the ball into the top corner.

More jeers followed Schalke’s players down the tunnel. Di Matteo may be cherished by Chelsea fans, but he has work to do if he is to win hearts in Gelsenkirchen.

He made changes but Chelsea rolled on. Mourinho was able to take off Diego Costa, Oscar and Fabregas in the second half. Costa has a knock but is expected to be fit for Saturday’s game at Sunderland.

As the match went into the final 15 minutes, Drogba tapped in the fourth, teed up by Willian, and then set up the fifth with a cross for Ramires to score with his head.

Amid the emotion of Di Matteo and his reunion it was easy to overlook that Mourinho has his own special connection with Gelsenkirchen. It was here that he first won the Champions League with Porto, before walking out to take the job at Stamford Bridge.

Ten years on, he is building another team which seems capable of challenging for the prize.
