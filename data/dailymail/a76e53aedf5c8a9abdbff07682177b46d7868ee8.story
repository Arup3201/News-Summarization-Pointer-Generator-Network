Forget 'no carbs before Marbs', the TOWIE cast spent more than £1,000 each on beauty and fitness treatment getting ready for their annual holiday to Marbella and the new series – and that’s just the boys.

The Only Way is Essex launched last week on ITV2 and the glamorous cast wanted to show their best toned and tanned side for the beach clubs and bars in the Spanish party town.

And it seems the men were just as keen to be plucked and preened to look their best.

James Diags stayed at a weight-loss boot camp in Ibiza for a week for £1,250 and had a couple of £185 facials to get rid of spots and break-outs on his face - adding up to a costly £1,620.

Playboy Tom Pearce had a £1,000 lipoglaze fat freezing treatment to take a couple of inches of hard-to-shift flab off his abs.

Talking about how much Essex boys spend to prepare for Marbs, Bobby Norris said: 'By the time you add up all the products and tanning regime it’s about £450-a-month.

'I
 think Essex guys generally do care about their appearance a bit more 
than most. And when it comes to Marbs we make that extra bit of effort.'

Talking about his treatment, he said: 'I get dry patches on cheeks and forehead and I used to get acne, it’s got better and I have facials quite often now as it makes a big difference.

'The Skinbreeze treatment has been amazing, my skin feels really fresh and moisturized and less flaky, so it’s a win-win.'

Not to be outdone, of course, several members of the female TOWIE cast spent more than £1,000 on beauty treatments and weight-loss camps, including Grace Andrews who had a lipoglaze fat freezing treatment which cost her £1,000 for 60-minute session.

Gemma Collins stayed at No 1 Boot Camp in Norfolk for nearly two weeks for the steep price tag of £2,400.
