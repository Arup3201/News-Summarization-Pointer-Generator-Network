Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, naturally led the fashion pack in a gorgeous blue and green graphic printed dress by British designer Jonathan Saunders.

And always-on-trend Victoria Beckham looked chic in a navy blue, burgundy, white and orange dress as she watched the match - also from the Royal Box.Â

Kate, meanwhile, wore heavy dark sunglasses as she watched the game intently. It is not known whether she later met up with her good friends, David and Victoria Beckham.

Victoria's husband David, 39, looked his 
usual dapper self in a navy double breasted jacket with gold buttons, 
navy patterned tie and crisp white shirt.

Fashion
 designer Victoria, 40, wore her long brunette hair pulled back into a pony tail with a side 
parting, topping off the elegant, understated look.

As for the Duchess of Cambridge's pretty bright outfit, it was not the first time she has chosen to dress in it.

Back in 2012 she wore it as part of the royal tour in the Solomon Islands.

Catherine, a champion of British designers both new and established, and of the British high street, is often seen in Jonathan Saunders outfits.

Earlier this year, in May, she was spotted out and about in a gorgeous long, red striped coat by the Scottish designer.

And in Aprilm during her Royal tour of Australia, the brunette beauty wore a Jonathan Saunders cream knit with skinny jeans and pumps to attend a Rippa Rugby tournament at Forsyth Barr Stadium.
