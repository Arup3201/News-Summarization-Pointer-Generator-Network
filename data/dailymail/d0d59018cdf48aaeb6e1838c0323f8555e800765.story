It may have made its way up the pole to become one of Britain's most famous chain of lap dancing clubs, but when it comes down to the actual financials Spearmint Rhino appears to be getting a little hot under the collar.

For the company, which runs five adult entertainment clubs across the country, has filed accounts showing that it made a loss of £2.1million in 2011.

The drop is far greater than the £733,265 loss recorded in 2010.

This is all despite pulling in a considerable £9.9m in revenue, up from £8.5m the previous year.

And despite the losses, UK boss John Sprecht, who once famously suggested that struggling students should strip their way through college, kept his salary the same at £304,000.

According to the UK operations' accounts, the profit loss was a result of writing off £2.5m of goodwill and debts to other businesses within the group and the results were "considered satisfactory by the directors given the prevailing economic conditions."

Other factors included rising administration costs, ill-fated business ventures and the departure of the American founder of Spearmint Rhino, John Gray, who left the UK business in April.

The accounts also reveal that the company owes HM Revenue and Customs more than £2m, which it has agreed to repay under a "time to pay" agreement.

It also seems the chain also owes almost £3m to Spearmint Rhino Worldwide Inc, which owns 12 clubs in the US.

Despite the losses, Spearmint Rhino says it has plans to expand and take on 60 new dancers and only last week the company applied to run the country's first 24-hour lap dancing club at its Tottenham Court Road venue.

No-one from Spearmint Rhino was available for comment.
