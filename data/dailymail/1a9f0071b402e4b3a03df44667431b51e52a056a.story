Care minister Norman Lamb will announce and end to the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway on Monday

The controversial Liverpool Care Pathway is to be ‘phased out’ over the next six to 12 months after an independent review found shocking examples of abuse across the NHS.

Care minister Norman Lamb will announce on Monday that the scheme, under which treatment is removed from those deemed close to death, will be scrapped.

It follows a review which heard allegations that the vulnerable were being put on the pathway without consent, they were being unnecessarily sedated and that others were being denied food and water.

The Neuberger inquiry also found ‘numerous examples of poor implementation and worrying standards in care’ which meant the LCP needed to be replaced.

The Daily Mail has led the way in campaigning against the so-called ‘death pathway’, highlighting how hospitals were being paid ‘bribes’ by the NHS to hit targets.

The Department of Health will also reveal that these incentive payments will be scrapped under whatever new system is introduced.

Last night Mr Lamb vowed that the replacement will definitely not be called a ‘pathway’.

He said:  ‘We need a whole new system of better end of life care tailored to the needs of individual patients and involving their families. I took the decision to launch this review because concerns were raised with me about how patients were being cared for and how families were being treated during this difficult and sensitive time.’

Every year 130,000 patients are placed on the LCP, which usually involves heavy sedation with morphine or similar drugs.

The Mail has revealed that NHS trusts were receiving six-figure sums for using the end-of-life regime – leading to fears that doctors were put under pressure to use the pathway.

Aintree University Hospitals Trust, in Liverpool, received £308,000 last year for achieving ‘goals including the Liverpool Care Pathway’.

Part of the money was tied to it achieving an LCP figure of 43 per cent against a target of 35 per cent. Salford Royal NHS Trust had LCP-linked payments halved for failing to hit targets.

The report found no evidence of misuse but Mr Lamb said the ‘bribes’ give such a bad impression that they should be scrapped.

Michelle Mitchell,  of the Age UK charity, said: ‘Any decision on the future of the Liverpool Care Pathway has to be based not just on what the guidance says but also on the reality of how it is being implemented.

 ‘As a society we must be able to ensure that people at the end of their lives are treated with compassion and dignity.’
