The first U.S. research centre dedicated to the late British Prime Minister Winston Churchill is to open in Washington, DC.

The Churchill Centre, an international group devoted to preserving the wartime leader's legacy, today announced an $8million (£5million) pledge to establish a new National Churchill Library and Centre at George Washington University.

Churchill remains an icon for leading Britain to victory during the Second World War and is also widely admired in the U.S.

Still making waves: The first U.S. research centre dedicated to Winston Churchill is to open in Washington, DC.

Sir Winston Churchill's stature is so gargantuan that polls regularly name him the greatest Briton to have ever lived.

The former prime minister famously inspired Britain to stand in defiance of Hitler's Nazi Germany during the Second World War.

He will forever be remembered for embodying the strength and spirit of Britain in one of its darkest periods, rousing the public with stirring speeches and broadcasts that gave hope to millions.

Born in 1874, Churchill began a career in politics after leaving the army in 1899.

He won the Conservative Party seat at Oldham in 1900. However, having become disaffected with the party he joined the Liberals four years later.

As President of the Board of Trade in Asquith’s Liberal government he set up labour exchanges and unemployment insurance.

As Home Secretary in 1910 he improved safety in the mines and prevented the employment of child miners, although he disappointed radicals by deploying troops in Wales during a miners' strike.

Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940, when Britain was at war with Germany, following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain.

He led the embattled nation until July 1945, and again between October 1951 and April 1955.

He died on January 24, 1965 and was given a state funeral.

Since his death, Churchill’s stature has continued to grow. He was recently voted ‘Greatest Ever Briton’ in a major BBC poll, beating Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Charles Darwin.

Rare books and research materials will be transferred to the university's library and the centre will be created between 2013 and 2015.

The gift will create endowments to support a professor and a curator devoted to Churchill and to 20th century British history.

From the gift, $2million (£1.3million) will be devoted to renovating space for the Churchill centre and $1million (£650,000) will fund exhibits and programmes.

George Washington University president Steven Knapp said the centre will become a destination for scholars and students of Churchill along with Washington's many museums, archives and libraries.

He said: 'We're going to be able to study the 20th century through the study of one of the towering figures of the 20th century, Winston Churchill.

'The idea here is to look at him not just in isolation but also setting him in his life and times.'

Born in 1874, Churchill's career in 
politics spanned 60 years, and he served in Britain's parliament, 
numerous executive posts and as prime minister for 10 years. He died in 
1965.

The Churchill 
Archives Centre at the University of Cambridge is the primary repository
for his documents and personal papers with over a million items.

Other
major Churchill institutions in Britain include the Churchill War Rooms
and Museum and Chartwell, the Churchill family's home.

Much
of Churchill's memorabilia has never been shown in the U.S., so the new
centre could borrow materials from the British institutions.

Members
of the U.S.-based Churchill Centre will build a collection to be housed
in Washington, said Lee Pollock, the group's executive director.

Several
members have personal collections they want to donate to a permanent 
library, rather than sell. The Washington collection could amass more 
than 1,000 volumes, he added.

'Americans are especially devoted Churchillians,' Mr Pollock said.

The
British icon is 'probably the most collectible and collected statesman'
of at least the last century, having written over 15million words and 
about 50 different books as a historian and writer, he added.
