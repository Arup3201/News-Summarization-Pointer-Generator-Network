Australian children are getting fatter, are more likely to survive infancy, more likely to suffer from abuse or neglect and are doing better at school, according to data released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare today.

The report found that childhood obesity has increased across the country, with 26 percent of all children aged five to 14 now classed as overweight or obese, compared to 23 percent in 2007.

Girls are more likely to have weight-related health problems than boys, with 27 percent of girls classed as overweight, compared to 25 percent of boys.

Rates of obesity have increased among Australian children, with with 26 percent of all children aged five to 14 now classed as overweight or obese, compared to 23 percent in 2007

Obesity rates were much higher among children in single parent families (35 percent) compared to those raised by a couple (24 percent).

Dr Al-Yaman said this result might relate to the socio-economic status of single parents.

'Not all single parents are poor but a significant proportion are low socio-economic. They're possibly also time-poor, with less time to spend on cooking, and junk food is cheaper than healthy food,' she said.

Dr Al-Yaman added that many sporting for children activities are expensive and single parents might not be able to afford them.

The Northern Territory had the highest rates of childhood obesity of all states (28.5 percent) and children born in Australia are significantly more likely to be overweight (27 percent) than children born overseas (20 percent).

Socio-economic status was the most significant determinant of a child's weight, with 33 percent of children living in the lowest SES area overweight or obese, compared to only 19 percent in the highest SES areas.

Rates of abuse and neglect were also higher among Australian children than they were six years ago, with 8.3 per 1,000 children suffering from abuse or neglect in 2012 compared to 7.4 children per 1,000 in 2008.

Dr Fadwa Al-Yaman from the AIHW cautions that abuse and neglect statistics are hard to interpret, and the increase may reflect higher rates of abuse in the community, but it may also reflect a higher community awareness of abuse and lower tolerance for it.

'Some of it is an increase in people reporting, which is a good thing,' she told MailOnline.

Literacy and numeracy rates have improved across the children, though still remain considerably lower among Indigenous children than non-Indigenous children

Children are more likely to be immunised than five years ago, and rates of immunisation are lowest among children who live in cities and in areas with high socio-economic staturs

Good news for parents included the fact that fewer children died from injuries in 2012 compared to 2004-2006. In 2012 there were 5.2 deaths per 100,000 children aged 0-14 compared to six deaths from injury per 100,000 children in 2004-2006.

Infant mortality among Indigenous children was 6.2 deaths per 1,000 live births compared to 3.6 deaths per 1,000 live births among non-Indigenous children.

Dr Al-Yaman said these results are an improvement on previous years.

'Infant mortality among Indigenous children has really come down a lot. If you look at earlier rates you find that the gap is closing,' she said.

Indigenous children were more than three times more likely to die by injury before the age of 14, with 17 deaths per 100,000 children compared to 5 deaths per 100,000 in the non-Indigenous population.

Rates of child abuse and neglect were six times higher among Indigenous children than non-Indigenous children. With 49 in every 1,000 Indigenous children abused or neglected compared to 8 in every 1,000 non-Indigenous children.

This was up from a rate of 42.5 in every 1,000 Indigenous children in 2007-2008.

Indigenous children also fared much worse when it came to meeting national minimum standards of numeracy and literacy – 69 percent and 65 percent respectively – compared to 93 percent and 92 percent of non-Indigenous children.

Australian children also have a better chance of surviving infancy, with infant mortality rates dropping from five deaths per 1,000 live births in 2006, to four deaths in 2012.

Boys are more likely to die at birth than girls, with 4.1 deaths per live 1,000 births, compared to 3.4 deaths among female babies.

Indigenous babies are almost twice as likely to die at birth as non-Indigenous babies, with seven deaths per 1,000 live births among Indigenous children compared to 3.9 deaths among non-Indigenous children.

Australian children are also performing better at school than they did five years ago.

93.3 percent of children in Year Five perform at or above the national minimum standards of numeracy and 91.6 percent for literacy, up from 92.7 percent and 91 percent respectively.

Indigenous children performed significantly worse in literacy and numeracy than non-Indigenous children, with only 69 percent of all Year Five students meeting the minimum national literacy standards, and 65 percent meeting the minimum national standards for numeracy.

Rates of immunisation among children have increased slightly across the country, from 92.5 percent in 2008 to 92.8 percent  in 2012.

People living in the highest socio-economic status areas, and in major cities were less likely to vaccinate their children than others, and Western Australia had the lowest rate of immunisation among all the states, with 90 percent of all WA babies vaccinated.
