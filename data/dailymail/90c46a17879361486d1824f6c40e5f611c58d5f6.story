David Silva has proved a knockout signing among the Manchester City faithful since his arrival in 2010 so it was no surprise when the midfield maverick received a special present from one famous fan.

Silva uploaded a picture to Twitter late on Wednesday night with himself holding a signed pictured frame from former light welterweight and welterweight boxing champion Ricky Hatton.

Accompanied with the caption: 'What a present I received today from the legend @HitmanHatton .Thanks amigo!' [sic] the picture frame contains a pair of signed boxing gloves as well as some iconic images from Hatton's previous bouts.

Despite the gift coming as a surprise to Silva, it may not come as one to many with Hatton's  - who is a lifelong fan of the current Premier League champions - allegiances to City well-documented.

His love for City is so much so that the 'Hitman' used to fight in sky blue shorts, the home colours of the club, and upon his entrance to fights his music choice would be the Etihad outfit's famous song 'Blue Moon.'

Silva will be aiming to return Hatton's kind gift with a standout performance when City host Newcastle in Saturday's Premier League encounter.

The match could see January signing Wilfried Bony make his debut alongside Silva and the Ivory Coast striker is hoping he can hit the ground running as they battle Chelsea for the Premier League title.

Bony, who netted 34 times in 70 appearances for Swansea, told mcfc.co.uk: 'It feels like a while since I signed the contract but finally I'm here, I'm really happy about that and now I'm just focusing on this Saturday's game.

'For me, it was really important to make this decision for my career and my life and I'm very happy to be a City player. I have spoken to my new team-mates and they have welcomed me to the club and I'm already feeling at home.

'It's not easy because I've just arrived from Africa and I will have had five days of training before we play Newcastle. I have to take it step by step and wait for the right opportunity to present itself.

'If I am needed, I have a good record against Newcastle - I've scored three goals in two games against them.

'They are a good side and are strong at the back but they are coming to our stadium and we need to win this game. Four days later we'll be playing Barcelona and we need to go into that game on the back of a strong performance.'
