Tyson Fury is aiming to turn Old Trafford into the Theatre of World Title Dreams and make his mark on the famous old stadium like his Manchester United idol Eric Cantona.

Fury became the mandatory challenger for Wladimir Klitschko's WBO heavyweight title after dismantling Dereck Chisora at the Excel Arena last month.

He will once again headline a bill in London, at the O2 Arena, on February 28 before attentions turn to arranging a world title showdown with WBA, WBO and IBF king Klitschko in the summer.

Promoter Frank Warren has set his sights on arranging a huge stadium show like the May 31 blockbuster topped by Carl Froch and George Groves at Wembley Stadium.

Warren has suggested the national stadium or the Emirates, home of his beloved Arsenal, as suitable venues for Fury's world title challenge, be it against Klitschko or for the vacant WBO crown should the Ukrainian choose to relinquish the belt.

But lifelong Manchester United fan Fury has other ideas.

'I don't know what these guys are on about,' he said, in reference to Warren and his own promoter Mick Hennessy, 'because they're from London they want to fight here all the time.

'I'm a big Manchester United fan so my dream fight would be at Old Trafford against Klitschko.

'These guys want it at Arsenal or Wembley but they're not my team, United is my team. Bar a few thousand tickets, it's basically the same attendance by the time the chairs are on the pitch and all that. I'm from Manchester so it makes sense to do it in the north west.

'The No 1 stadium in the country is obviously Wembley – it's the capital city and the biggest capacity so I understand why promoters want to put on fights there. But I'm not from London, I'm from Manchester so I believe it should happen where I'm from.

'If I'm going to fulfill my dream of fighting for the world heavyweight title and winning it then I want to do it at Old Trafford. It's called the Theatre of Dreams and it's where my dream will come true.'

Old Trafford memorably played host to the 1993 rematch between Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank when the fierce British rivals drew their WBC and WBO super-middleweight title clash in front of the Stretford End.

Since then, the city's premier boxing venue has become the 21,000-seater Phones4u Arena, where local lads like Ricky Hatton and Scott Quigg have had world title fights. But Fury reckons the time is right to take boxing back to the 104-year-old home of Manchester United.

Fury, currently unbeaten after 23 fights, said: 'I think the town deserves a world heavyweight title fight. They've got the two best football teams in the world so it deserves a big title fight in a stadium.

'It would be a great night for me, as a lifelong United fan, and a big night for the city as well. It has never had a big heavyweight title fight there before and it could be a massive opportunity.

Fury says he shares many similarities with Manchester United legend Eric Cantona

'I've been down there quite a lot this year, I do a lot of charity things and events as well as go to games so I'm down there often. I get mobbed on match days – it's good.'

Fury also revealed he has always admired one of the most controversial United icons of his generation – French great Eric Cantona. 

The gifted striker is considered one of the club's best ever players after scoring 89 goals in 193 games following his £1.2m move from Leeds in 1992. 

But he also made headlines off the pitch, most memorably in January 1995 when he was banned for nine months and ordered to do 120 hours community service after an infamous flying kick on 20-year-old Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons, who had goaded the Frenchman from the stands.

And, although he has so far refrained from sticking one on a punter, Fury is considered one of the most colourful characters in British boxing and thinks he and Cantona have a lot in common.

He added: 'I've supported them all my life and my United idol is Cantona. He's my hero of all time. People say there are similarities between us – we're both crazy, we both say what we think and do what we want.'

Fury has his doubts that Klitschko will ever agree to fighting him, and it has been suggested that the long-time champion, who calls himself Dr Steelhammer, does not want to deal with any of the Englishman's antics.

When asked whether Wlad, the new father-of-one, might be cautious of travelling to Old Trafford to fight Fury in his won backyard, the 6ft 9in traveler admitted: 'I don't know. It's just about getting him in the ring. Listen, I would fight him in this room in front of 100 people, that's how confident I am. It doesn't matter if it's in his back garden or anywhere, he's still going to lose the fight.'
