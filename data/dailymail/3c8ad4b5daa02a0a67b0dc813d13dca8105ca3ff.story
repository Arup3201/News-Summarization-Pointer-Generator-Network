A 14-year-old high school football player died Wednesday in northeast Florida after collapsing during a practice at his team's football camp.

William Shogran, Jr was a home-school student who played for his local team at Sebastian River High School on the central Florida coast, according to the Clay County Sheriff's Office.

The team was at Camp Blanding, a Florida National Guard training base in Starke, conducting its start-of-the-season camp when Shogran fell ill around 11am.

Collapsed: A coach called 911 saying William Shogran, Jr, 14, had 'heat issues' and had vomited. The boy died a short time later

Weather reports had a high of 89 with 89 per cent humidity, which meant it felt more like 94 degrees.

The boys were all wearing full pads, according to TC Palm.

In a 911 recording, a coach reported that a player needed medical assistance for 'heat issues' and that he had vomited.

The dispatcher asked if the boy was conscious. The coach said he was.

'They've got water on him, trying to cool him down,' the coach said.

The ninth-grader was taken to Shands Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

'Coaches are at the hospital and coaches are also at the camp/base with the teammates,' said Mary Justino, a sheriff's office spokeswoman.

Cut short: The Sebastian River High School football team returned from camp early following Shogran's death. Grief counselors were on-hand for staff and students

Bill Fritz, an official with the Indian River County School District, said members of the team were heading back to the high school and that grief counselors were being made available.

'The school district and Sebastian River High School communities are deeply saddened by this news,' Fritz said in a statement.

According to TC Palm, a autopsy results could take up to six months.

The boy's distraught mother Maria Wray said her son had been excited for football camp and to be playing for the local school's team.

She told WJXT that her son loved his XBox and reading comics.

'Hug your kids all the time and tell them that you love them,' Wray said.
