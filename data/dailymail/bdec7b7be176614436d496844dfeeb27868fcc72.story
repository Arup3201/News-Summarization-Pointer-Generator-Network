The Cote d’Azur, also known as the French Riviera, was a star-studded playground of celebrities from show business, the art and business world in the middle of the last century. 

Irish photographer Edward Quinn lived and worked there.

Described as a ‘cocktail’ photographer, Quinn charmed the stars vacationing on the strikingly beautiful Mediterranean coastline of the southeast corner of France. They willingly let him photograph them while on holiday, where they brought their furry and no-so-furry friends along or made new ones.  Below are some of the exquisite photographs from the new coffee table book Celebrity Pets on the French Riviera in the 50s and 60s publishes by teNeues publishers.

Bathing beauties: French film star Brigitte Bardot sunbathes with her black spaniel, Clown, in 1956 on the French Riviera. Clown was a present from her then husband, film director Roger Vadim. This was the year that the film And God Created Woman launched Bardot to international fame as a sex symbol. Thirty-four years old at the time, she divorced Vadim the following year.

Black and white period: Pablo Picasso loved dogs and owned many but his Dalmatian Perro appeared on canvas in some of his later paintings. He lived in a sumptuous 19th century house, Villa La Californie, in the hills above Cannes with an uninterrupted view of the sea. This photo was taken in 1961

Hold that tiger: American movie star Grace Kelly met Prince Rainier III of Monaco in 1955 for the first time in the private zoo of Rainier’s palace. The photographer, Quinn, suggested that the couple stroll through the zoo as an ice-breaker between the self-conscious couple.The meeting had been arranged by Paris-Match, the French news weekly magazine. Exhausted by a European tour, it is rumored that Grace unsuccessfully tried to cancel this meeting. She returned to Hollywood and their relationship quickly evolved through correspondence. They married the following year.

Leap frog: Audrey Hepburn was in Monaco for the movie Monte Carlo Baby at the very beginning of her film career in 1951. It was here in Monte Carlo that she was spotted on the set of the film outside of the Hotel de Paris and chosen to play the role of Gigi that shot her to international stardom.

Grrrreat: Film star Elizabeth Taylor was in Cannes in 1957 for the Cannes Film Festival with her then third husband, producer Mike Todd. She is the only one laughing in a close encounter with a large lion cub. On the far left is Art Buchwald, famous New York Herald columnist at the time. Todd’s film Around the World in 80 Days won an Oscar for Best Picture that year

Member of the wedding: Bardot relaxes between shooting the film Voulez-vous danser avec moi? (Come Dance With Me) in Nice, 1959. She is pictured with her beloved dog, Guapa, a rescue dog she adopted that had been abused by children in Spain. Guapa, meaning ‘Pretty girl’, became Bardot’s adored dog for the next fifteen years

Giddyup: Frank Sinatra arrived by carriage in Monte Carlo in 1958 where he performed at a charity Gala Evening at the Sporting d’Eté (Sporting Club) for the UN Refugee Children. His album, Come Fly with Me, came out that year and was nominated for Album of the Year along with five other Grammy nominations at the inaugural Grammy Awards in 1959

Ay, Chihuahua! Jayne Mansfield hugs her Chihuahua while taking a dip in Cannes in 1958. She was on the Riviera with her second husband Mickey Hargitay attending the Cannes Film Festival. The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield, an x-rated ‘documentary’ that followed her wild and sexy adventures through Rome, Cannes, Paris, New York and Los Angeles came out in 1968, a year after her death in a car accident in 1967

Splendid: Film actress Natalie Wood arrived in Cannes in 1962, with her Splendor in the Grass co-star and boyfriend of the hour, actor Warren Beatty. The couple stayed at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes. A dachshund watches their arrival

Winging it: Spanish Catalan Surrealist painter Salvador Dali kept a summer home in Portlligat, Cadaques, a small village on the coast of Spain south of the Riviera. The famous artist gathered the fallen feathers from the swans that lived on the shoreline in front of his house and used them for his experimental painting work with a sea urchin. 1957

Spotted: Italian film star Claudia Cardinale, Italian film director Luchino Visconti and Hollywood movie star Burt Lancaster presented their movie Il Gattopardo at the Cannes Film Festival in 1963 in the company of a large cheetah. The film’s title translated to The Leopard and was nominated for an Oscar

Elizabeth Taylor with her miniature poodle in the summer of 1957 when she and Mike Todd rented the sumptuous Mediterranean style Villa Florentina, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat. Liz would return to La Florentina in 1967 with Richard Burton ten years later
