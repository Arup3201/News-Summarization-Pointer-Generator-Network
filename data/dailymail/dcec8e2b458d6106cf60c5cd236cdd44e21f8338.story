A wealthy former UBS banker and his wife were tied up at gunpoint during a terrifying home invasion at their $2.5m mansion whilst their three children were inside.

Leonardo and Lana LeBrun were bound and gagged by an attacker who shot Mrs Lebrun in the stomach with a BB gun as he demanded their money.

He also made off with a number of valuable paintings which hung in the living room including one by Cornelis Springer, a 19th century Dutch landscape artist.

Mrs LeBrun managed to wriggle free and raise the alarm but just days later the attacker allegedly continued his assault by trying to extort $3m from them.

He sent chilling letters saying he had followed their son home from school in the hope they would pay up - but he failed to follow through on his violent threats.

Bartek Zajkowski, a contractor who once works on the Lebrun's 20-acre estate in Bedford Hills, New York, has now been arrested.

The incident unfolded at the chateau-style property which has a long driveway setting it back from the road, landscaped grounds and several bedrooms.

Mr LeBrun, 52, a former co-head of a UBS Bank mergers and acquisitions who now runs his own financial company, was smoking a cigarette near his garage when Zajkowski allegedly approached him with his gun out said: 'What valuables are inside?'

Mr LeBrun replied that there were indeed some in the property along with gold and silver bullion.

Zajkowski then allegedly tied up his hands and feet and put duct tape over his mouth before stealing his wallet with credit cards inside and moving into the house.

Inside were Mrs LeBrun, their children and the housekeeper.

Zajkowski is said to have found Mrs LeBrun in her bedroom where he forced her to the ground.

When she fought back he is said to have shot her in the stomach with his BB gun.

Zajkowski then allegedly tied her up but Mrs LeBrun managed to wriggle free after he left and trigger the house alarm.

The nightmare did not end there, however - and just as they were recovering the LeBruns received the first of three disturbing letters which demanded they pay $3m or their children would be harmed.

One of the letters read: 'If you want your KIDS to to be SAFE YOU will PAY one million $ for each one. 3 kids = 3 million $.Â

'It can be 3 payments of 1 million each on the account you receive.

'Faster you pay all of it, faster I will be gone.'

Another, designed to intimidate the family, read: 'Your boy comes from school at 4 pm he walk from the rode to the house all by him self with big black book bag wich is all most bigger then him.

'Looks like nice kid. Like I said to you I dont like mess with kids, but what need to be done has to be done.'

In with one of the letters was an article from OK! Magazine about a six-year old child who had been kidnapped from her home in Tucson, Arizona.

The LeBruns did not pay and instead went to the police. Nothing happened when the deadline set in the letters came and went.

Zajkowski was caught after allegedly attempting another home invasion in Connecticut.

He dropped his bag of kit which allowed detectives to match his fingerprints to the LeBrun crime.

According to the criminal complaint, under questioning Zajkowski said he only wanted to steal Mr LeBrun's wallet when he carried out the attack.

He also 'stated that he would think about it again first before doing it.'
