With multiple weapons drawn and a pistol 
placed to his head, a dramatic photo captures the moment FBI agents and police officers took down a suspected serial bank robber, while appearing nothing short of a Hollywood movie.

The incredible scene out of Oklahoma City on Friday led to three arrests linked to at least five bank robberies throughout the area in the last two months, according to authorities.

Michael Lewis, 27, and Jerry Lewis, 19, were apprehended just hours after the last armed robbery was reported at the city's MidFirst Bank that morning.

The pair successfully fled the scene with an undisclosed sum before crashing their stolen car into a tree in an apartment complex.

Fears of the armed men running on foot throughout the area led to four schools placed under lock down.

The men were later found at two separate homes on the same street of Los Pueblos.

A third suspect, Edna Huff, 21, was also arrested inside one of the homes on related charges. A fourth arrest was made without their name or relation provided.

'We definitely do believe that they all are connected,' FBI Special Agent Rick Rains told News9 of the two men's arrest.

Bank robberies face suspects with up to 20 years behind bars, according to Rains.

After an ongoing string of bank robberies throughout the area, the suspects' arrest hopes to calm residents' late worries about going to their bank.

'I don't have a bank account right now and I'm not going to get one, not with this going on. I'm going to bury my money in the backyard,' one man joked to News9 after hearing of the latest heist.
