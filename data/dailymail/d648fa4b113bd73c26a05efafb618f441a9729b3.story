Golfers pushed for time can now get their skates on thanks to a new board that allows them to cruise around the course.

The new motorised skateboard allows golfers to move over to their ball at an impressive 12mph - the same speed as a traditional buggy.

Fitted with a lithium battery, the 15 inch wide device has a gear box with a peak power of 3,000W.

A handheld controller allows the user to smoothly accelerate, decelerate, and reverse direction.

It can last for 36 holes and does not struggle on the course with its 3.5 inch wide turf tyres, which leave a smaller footprint compared to a buggy.

The bag handle provides stability and storage space for golf gear, snacks, and refreshments.

Its low centre of gravity means the user will never have to worry about their board and bag tipping over.

Paul Hodge, 40, came up with the idea when he got bored with the sport he'd been playing for decades.

He said: ‘I've been playing golf for 20 years, but have been bored with the game.

‘A few friends showed me some powerful electric skateboards that they had built several years ago.

‘I knew right away there was going to be some sort of business opportunity with them, but didn't know exactly what.

‘We decided to target golf, the market is huge, courses are fun to ride on and it seemed like a perfect fit.’

Mr Hodge, from Seattle, Washington, was tired of using a buggy and wanted to inject life back into the sport.

‘A golf buggy is boring, the GolfBoard makes golf fun again, I enjoy riding to get my ball, more than the golfing itself now,’ he said.

‘I have done a little skateboarding, and more snowboarding and some surfing, other members of our team are big surfers.

‘It has a feeling of surfing, especially without the bindings, with the bindings it really feels a lot like snowboarding.’

Mr Hodge claims that his creation can revolutionise the world of golf and encourage younger people to get into the sport.

‘Golf needs to attract the younger crowds to survive as the average age of golfers is rising,’ he said.

‘It also speeds the game up, allowing each person to have their own cart allowing golf courses to push through more traffic.

‘I doubt they will be used in major tournaments, but I do expect to see them adopted on 90 per cent of golf courses across America and beyond.’
