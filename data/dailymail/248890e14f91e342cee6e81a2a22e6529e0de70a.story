Richard Money will warn his Cambridge players that any shirts swapped with Manchester United's megastars after Friday's FA Cup tie must be replaced at their own cost – and anyone trading them at half-time will be shirtless for the rest of the game.

A shirt-swap souvenir with Wayne Rooney or Robin van Persie will cost them the price of a new shirt, priced at £39.99 at the club shop - unless they can persuade chairman Dave Doggett to dip into the £250,000 the League Two club will earn from the game.

Cambridge boss Richard Money has issued warning to his players over shirt swapping

'We're not wealthy enough to give any of our shirts away,' said Cambridge boss Money. 'If they give their shirt away they're going to have to replace it. Maybe the club will do it, I don't know, but I'm not going to do it.

'It would appear that in the Premier League they give their shirt away after every game – sometimes at half-time. I don't understand why a top class player would want another top class player's shirt at half-time.

'If one of our players was trying to swap a shirt at half-time you could understand it, but they won't as they wouldn't have anything to wear in the second half.'

League Two club will be seeking to cause a massive upset in the FA Cup on Friday night

It is a classic clash of the haves and have-nots in the FA Cup fourth round at the R Costings Abbey Stadium on Friday night.

Cambridge runs largely with the help of volunteers and handful of full-time operational staff and their total annual wage bill for a year is just over £1million, roughly what players like the top players Rooney will earn in a month at Manchester United.

'We were determined not to increase the ticket prices,' said chief executive Jez George. 'We've charged £10 for a kid to watch on the terraces. You think it is quick win to make a lot of money on the night but in the longer term it does more harm than good.

'Once Man United go out of town we're back to League Two and valuing those supporters again, so we mustn't try to exploit the situation. We want to make sure we get the fans to come back. The game needs to be about more than what happens on the night.

'This club has lost money for the last 10 years and has survived due to the generosity of individuals, who have the club at heart like the chairman, Dave Doggett, some directors and Paul Barry, our major shareholder.

'They do it for a genuine love for the club. After a lot of years of finding it really tough maybe this tie is a bit of luck that the club's deserved.'
