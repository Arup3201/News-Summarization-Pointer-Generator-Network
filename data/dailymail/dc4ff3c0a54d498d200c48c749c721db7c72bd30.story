Intrepid: Jac Holmes has left his job and moved to Syria after becoming outraged at the atrocities committed by ISIS in the country

An IT worker from Bournemouth has quit his job and travelled to Syria to fight against Islamic State terrorists - despite having no military training.

Jac Holmes, 22, has joined up with the Kurdish peshmerga militia and hopes he will be allowed onto the front line in the battle against the Islamist extremists who rule vast swathes of Syria and Iraq.

He says he is keen to take up arms against ISIS as soon as possible even though he has never fought in battle before and has received little training from the Kurdish forces.

Mr Holmes was until recently working on the service desk for an outsourcing firm which provides services to Bournemouth Council.

But now he has resigned from the company and left his parents in order to go to the Middle East.

He told the BBC World Service he flew to Iraqi Kurdistan, where he was met at the airport by a peshmerga contact and taken to a safe house in the city of Sulaymaniyah.

From there, fighters smuggled him over the border with Syria - which is now partly patrolled by ISIS - and transported him to a camp in the war-torn country.

An initial attempt to join up with the peshmerga was foiled when he was deported from Erbil airport in northern Iraq and forced to leave the country.

Mr Holmes said he was inspired to oppose both ISIS and the murderous regime of Bashar Al Assad after seeing Western governments fail to intervene in the mounting chaos.

Asked if he found the idea of fighting in Syria exciting, he replied: 'I see it as a necessity, something which if our governments were supporting the Kurds in the ways that they should probably wouldn't need to happen.'

He said that he was just one of many Westerners at the pershmerga camp, adding that those with military experience had helped him build his own fighting skills.

Mr Holmes added that he was prepared for the possibility of being taken hostage, saying: 'It's something you take into account when you think about coming here - but I'd rather die than be captured by Islamic State, because we all know what sort of brutality they get up to.'

He said that his parents were resistant to his decision to put himself in danger, but were nonetheless continuing to support him.

Mr Holmes told the BBC he was likely to start fighting on the front line soon despite his inexperience.

'We are expecting to move out of the training camp fairly soon,' he said. 'There is an operation planned in our area but it has been delayed at the moment due to weather and we are waiting for NATO air strikes too.'

However, a peshmerga leader insisted that no one was allowed to take up arms until they had been thoroughly trained in the militia's tactics.

Conflict: Berkshire bouncer Tim Locks, pictured, is another Briton who is now fighting against ISIS terrorists

Last week, a bouncer from Berkshire revealed that he had sold his home in order to join the fight against ISIS.

Tim Locks has joined up with Dwekh Nawsha, a Christian military group based in Iraq which is opposed to Islamic extremism.

The Foreign Office currently advises British citizens not to travel to any part of Syria due to the civil war there which has raged for nearly four years.

A spokesman said that British authorities would be unable to offer consular assistance to anyone who got in trouble in the area.

The Home Office warns that anyone who travels to areas where ISIS is active could face arrest on their return, due to the high volume of terrorist groups in the region.

'The UK advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq,' a spokesman said. 'Anyone who does travel to these areas, even for humanitarian reasons, is putting themselves in considerable danger.

'The best way for the public to help is to donate to or otherwise support UK-registered charities with ongoing relief operations.'
