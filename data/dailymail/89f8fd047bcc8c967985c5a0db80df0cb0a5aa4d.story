After a dramatic late victory against Manchester City in the Champions League midweek, Bayern Munich came crashing down to earth with a goalless draw against Hamburg in the Bundesliga.

Manager Pep Guardiola rested several star players including Robert Lewandowski, Mario Gotze and new signing Xabi Alonso while the absence of Franck Ribery was also felt.

Arjen Robben was due to start for Bayern but injured himself in the warm-up and was replaced by Thomas Mueller.

Hamburg coach Zinnbauer, who took over from the fired Mirko Slomka on Tuesday, earned the club its second point after its worst start to the season in 51 years of the Bundesliga. 

The home side started well, closing down any space and restricting Bayern's goal opportunities. Claudio Pizarro fired over a rare chance in the 20th minute.

Nicolai Mueller almost scored for Hamburg after the break, when Manuel Neuer rushed out of his goal, but his effort drifted just wide.

Despite having the lion's share of possession, the Bundesliga champions only registered a paltry three attempts on target as their indifferent start to the domestic season continued.
