Barack Obama's college digs are currently listed on the rental website Airbnb - a far cry from the palatial White House where he lives now with his family.

The cozy two-bedroom apartment, located on New York's Upper East Side, comes out at $135 per night complete with a small living room and kitchen area.

The property's host, Oren, tells prospective tenants that it's where the U.S. President stayed during his time at Columbia University and it's even mentioned in Mr Obama's memoir, Dreams from My Father.

A spokesperson for Airbnb told MailOnline that great care is taken to authenticate people’s claims before each listing goes live.

‘We research each property using a combination of web-based research and specialist skills in the team - one member was a former librarian,' they revealed.

‘For example, to verify Bing Crosby's house in Palm Springs we combed through historical photo archives until we found an old LIFE magazine image of him inside the home.

'We also have a team of professional photographers that we will send out to listings to verify that they are a true likeness of what's being advertised.’

Hollywood walk of fame: This jungle-drenched group of cottages were built by Charlie Chaplin in the 1920s as a very centrally-located village for his crewmen

The contemporary space accommodates four people and is priced at $400 a night.

Airbnb's spokesperson concluded: 'People love staying in unique and interesting places and these properties are some of the most interesting on Airbnb.

'What better way to see what life was like for your celebrity heroes than by living like they did.'
