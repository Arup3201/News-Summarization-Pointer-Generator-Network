How far would you go if your car is clamped and the tow away truck is about to take it away? 

This woman in Russia staged a striptease to try and avoid the traffic police from removing her vehicle. 

She leaped onto the truck - beside her car - and started peeling off her clothes to prevent them driving away.

She leaped onto the truck - beside her car - and started peeling off her clothes to prevent them driving away 

An onlooker caught her extraordinary pole dancing scene on camera in the Russian city of Tula. 

Anatoliy Aleksandrovich posted the video on the web saying: 'Look at how far some drivers go to stop their car being towed away.'

Police evidently objected to her parking outside the city's Railway Workers' House of Culture.  

'This lady did a real show, trying to stop traffic police from taking her car away,' he said. 

As she dances - stripping to her knickers and a top - she tries negotiating with the officers, not that it had the desired result. 

'Legally she was right to stop them as by law police can not take away the car if the driver is present,' he said.

'Despite the girl's best efforts the car was still taken away.' 

Some comments suggest she should have used a more tried and tested system with the Russian traffic police. 

Many drivers find that a small cash bribe can prevent their car being taken away, or avoid punishment for other road offences.
