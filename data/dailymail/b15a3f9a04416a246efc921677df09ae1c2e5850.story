The father of the 12-year-old Sparks Middle School shooter was found guilty of child abuse after admitting hitting his son and giving him a black eye in 2012, it has emerged.

Seventh grader Jose Reyes walked into the Nevada school on the morning of October 21 and opened fire with a 9-millimeter Ruger semiautomatic pistol before the first bell had rung.

Teacher Michael Landsberry was shot dead and two male students were innjured before Reyes  turned the gun on himself.

also named Jose Reyes, had been arrested for hitting his son and leaving
with a black eye in 2012 it has emerged

Account: The police record from the incident telld how Mr Reyes hit his 
son several time across the face leaving him with a black eye

The boy's father
Jose Horacio Reyes, 32, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child abuse 
charges, after admitting hitting his son in January 2012.

Police records tell how the pair had 
argued after returning home from buying video games. The youngster was 
apparently having trouble counting the money to pay for the games and 
his father had tried to teach him.

There
had apparently been a disagreement after which Reyes, referred to as 
Reyes-Mandujano in the record, said to his son: 'You don't have to be a 
crybaby.'

He told 
the police that his son then became upset and hit him at which point he 
lost control and smacked the boy two or three times across the face with
an open hand and then a back hand.

The record states: 'The strikes to REYES face resulted in a black eye.'

The following day the father reported the incident to school officials and was arrested on felony child abuse charges.

He
later pleaded guilty in Sparks Justice Court to a misdemeanor charge of
child abuse, neglect or endangerment and was ordered to pay a $500 fine
and attend anger management and parenting classes.

dead by 12-year-old Jose Reyes at the school where he taught in Sparks, Nevada

Landsberry is believed to have been a married father who had just celebrated his wedding anniversary this weekend

According to the arrest report, Reyes told police he felt  'sick to his stomach' about what he had done.

The record shows that he had no previous criminal history and that his son told the same story about the incident.'

The
arresting officer wrote: 'Reyes-Mandujano is being very cooperative and
honest and forthright, but I was still going to place him under arrest 
and take him to jail tonight.'

The
shocked community is still struggling to come to terms with the 
shooting and explain what drove an apparently happy 12-year-old to bring
a gun into school.

His
parents described him as a loving son who would kiss them every day and
used to save the money he earned working at his family's restaurants to
buy gifts for his two younger sisters and treat his parents to dinner.

Mr Reyes said: 'We did not know Jose was angry or upset about conditions at school.

'He
had never complained about any particular teacher or student. We knew 
that he had been teased and that he was trying to work through a speech 
problem that he had.'

Teacher Michael Landsberry,
45, who died after being shot by the boy was an ex-Marine who coached 
basketball and soccer and was known as a big fan of Batman.

He
had served several tours of Afghanistan before becoming a much loved 
teacher. He is understood to have been shot while trying to talk the boy
into handing over his weapon.

Around 20 to 30 middle school students witnessed the multiple shootings.

A
seventh-grade student called Andrew Thompson told IBNlive: 'A kid 
started getting mad and he pulled out a gun and shoots my friend, one of
my friends at least.

'And then he walked up to a teacher and says back up. The teacher started backing up and he pulled the trigger.'

Sparks students struggled to cope with the violence that began before the morning bell had rung

Two
12-year-old male students were taken to hospital in critical condition 
after one was shot in the stomach and the other shot in the shoulder.

One young man underwent surgery. Both students are now said to be in stable condition.

It is believed the student stole the semi-automatic handgun from his parents' home.

Sparks City Attorney Chet Adams released the boy’s name after the Reno Gazette-Journal announced its plans to file a lawsuit.

Multiple
students at the school had already told the the Reno Review-Journal 
that Reyes was the shooter, but the newspaper refused to report the name
lacking official confirmation.

However,
authorities were fighting a losing battle as the young shooters 
identity was already widely known amongst Sparks' 90,000 residents and 
was being circulated widely on social media.

City
officials later acknowledged a report from the Univision affiliate in 
Reno that disclosed the name and said they would release it publicly to 
be fair to families and other media outlets.

In
a news release, Sparks spokesman Adam Mayberry said the name of the 
seventh-grader was released in 'order to be fair to all the families 
involved and all the news media.'
