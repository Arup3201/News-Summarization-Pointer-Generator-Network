U.S. security officials have stripped down an entire floor of a Brisbane hotel and removed furniture to prevent President Barack Obama being spied on during his stay for the G20 summit this weekend.

Mr Obama's security agents ordered beds, mirrors and bedding be removed from rooms surrounding the suite where the President will stay at the five-star Marriott Hotel in Queensland's capital city, the Courier-Mail reported.

The floor will be checked for bugs before Mr Obama arrives on Saturday, to ensure he can make secure phone calls and conduct meetings.

In addition to the President's floor, hundreds of Mr Obama's staffers will occupy additional floors in the hotel.

World leaders, the media, tourists and protesters will soon begin to converge on Brisbane for the G20 summit this weekend.

Security agencies are scanning the city 24 hours a day and barricades have been going up around the restricted zones where dignitaries will be meeting and sleeping.

Special G20 laws came into force on Friday evening and one man has been already been banned from the area.

He was charged after allegedly refusing to provide police with his details after taking photos of the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre on Saturday night.

The first official G20-related protest, featuring about 100 people dressed as corporate accountants to highlight multinational tax dodging, was held peacefully without anyone being arrested on Saturday.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott will hold talks with Mr Obama on Monday, ahead of the APEC summit in Beijing this week.

The prime minister will have an hour-long meeting with Mr Obama in the Chinese capital on Monday, before the APEC leaders summit officially kicks off.

Mr Abbott and Mr Obama will discuss the agenda for the G20, but the talks will be firmly focused on the coalition efforts against IS in Iraq.

The pair are also likely to touch on the MH17 disaster and will give a rare joint press conference.
