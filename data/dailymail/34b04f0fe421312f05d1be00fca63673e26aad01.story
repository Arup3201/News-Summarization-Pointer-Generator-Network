CNN has come under fire from outraged readers who accused the cable network of sexism for a post that discussed the impact of female hormones on voting behavior.

The CNN.com story in question, 'Do hormones drive women's votes?' prompted a barrage of criticism on social media and the network eventually removed the write-up from the web on Wednesday night, saying in a statement that it failed to meet the journalistic standards of CNN.

The article was based on a research study published in Psychological Science and though the author of the CNN article has defended her work, the website for the cable network has said the piece should never have reached the light of day.

Backlash: CNN has come under fire for a post on their website about the impact of female hormones on voting behavior

The story, which has since been removed but was republished on a local news website, discusses the findings from a survey of several hundred women by Dr
 Kristina Durante, an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the University
 of Texas at San Antonio.

According to Dr Durante, during ovulation single women will 'feel sexier' and their political views will swing more liberal but married/women in committed relationships will cling to conservative viewpoints during fertile phases.

'While the campaigns eagerly pursue female voters, there’s something that may raise the chances for both presidential candidates that’s totally out of their control: women’s ovulation cycles,' read the article from CNN reporter Elizabeth Landau

'New research suggests that hormones may influence female voting choices differently, depending on whether a woman is single or in a committed relationship.'

'Please continue reading with caution. Although the study will be published in the peer-reviewed journal Psychological Science, several political scientists who read the study have expressed skepticism about its conclusions,' the author warned about Durante's academic paper, 'The Fluctuating Female Vote: Politics, Religion, and the Ovulatory Cycle.'

But even with that caveat, the article's explanation of research drew a firestorm of criticism from followers who called the study backward and slammed CNN.com for giving it credibility.

'This study published in the Journal of Giant Steps Backwards for Election Coverage,' one Twitter user quipped.

Don't shoot the messenger: Elizabeth Landau, who authored the CNN post, said she was merely reporting on a study

'Yes world has gone bad. CNN trying to tie women hormone levels to their vote,' another user wrote, with others calling the piece 'awful' and 'sexist.'

But Landau, a graduate of Princeton who also has a degree from the Columbia School of Journalism, defended her work. 

'For
 the record, I was reporting on a study to be published in a 
peer-reviewed journal & included skepticism. I did not conduct the 
study,' Landau, a CNN reporter based in Atlanta, Georgia, tweeted late 
Wednesday.

Upon reflection,
 the website for the cable network relented and removed Landau's piece 
saying it fell below their journalistic standards.

'A
 post previously published in this space regarding a study about how 
hormones may influence voting choices has been removed,' a message on the site read.

'After further review it was determined that some elements of the story did not meet the editorial standards of CNN.'

In
 an official statement released later, CNN pointed out that Landau's 
piece 'did not channel through the standard internal process and it was 
not reviewed by senior editorial staff before appearing on CNN.com.'

'As
 recognized by our leadership, audience and critics, the piece did not 
meet the journalistic standards of CNN and should not have appeared on 
our site. We had an obligation to remove it.'

Dr
Durante was the chief author of the academic paper, 'The Fluctuating Female 
Vote: Politics, Religion, and the Ovulatory Cycle,' with two contributing authors also listed - Ashley
 R. Arsena, a Ph.D. student in marketing at the UTSA, and Vladas 
Griskevicius, a professor of marketing and psychology at the University 
of Michigan.

Dr Durante did not respond to a request for comment about the controversy at CNN.com regarding her research. 

The hormonal impact on female behavior has long been a research interest for the Texas based academic.

She previously released a paper last April that concluded 'women at peak fertility (near ovulation) are 
attracted to different kinds of men and show increased desire to attend 
social gatherings.'

In 'Ovulation, Female Competition, and Product Choice: Hormonal Influences on Consumer Behavior,'
 she discussed how 'at peak fertility women nonconsciously choose
 products that enhance appearance (e.g., choosing sexy rather than more 
conservative clothing)...This research provides some of the first evidence of how, why, and when consumer behavior is influenced by hormonal factors.'
