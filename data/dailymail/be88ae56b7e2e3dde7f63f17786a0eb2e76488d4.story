A Chicago Blackhawks' fan who was hit in the face 'like an arrow' by a hard, rubber hockey puck during game one of the Stanley Cup playoffs on Wednesday and required surgery to repair a 'bone-deep' gash above her eyebrow is recovering at home.

Dr. Patricia Higgins, 55, a family practitioner in a Chicago suburb attended the game with her 26-year-old daughter when a puck came over the glass and hit her in the face.

The result: a 1-and-a-half-inch, bone-deep gash extending from the top of her nose to above her right eyebrow.

Ouch! Patricia Higgins didn't even get to keep the puck that hit her in the face

The wound required 'a ton of internal and 
external stitches' from a plastic surgeon but did not cause any internal 
damage, her daughter Caitlin Higgins told the Chicago Sun-Times.

“She’ll have a nice shiner for a while,” the younger Higgins told the paper. 'I just keep 
thinking "If only I’d raised my hands, I could have deflected the puck,"
or if my brother had been at the game and not me, he’s tall, the puck 
would have bounced off his chest and left a bruise.'

Higgins' mother, who did not wish to be identified by the paper, says she was watching the game at home on television when she heard someone was hit with a puck.

'We heard the announcer say someone had gotten hit by the puck, and 
that was all the reference they made to it. And we noticed a couple of 
the players looking up into the stands,' Higgins’ mother said.

Then came the phone call - about 10 minutes after hearing it on television, Caitlin Higgins called her grandmother and said, 'Mom got hit.'

At the hospital, Higgins was 'pretty much sleeping' when the Blackhawks won the game in triple overtime, but looked at her daughter, 'smiled and said ‘all right.'

The worst part of the story: Higgins didn't even get the puck that hit her in the face.

'At the hospital, the paramedics said, "Did you at least get the 
puck?" I hadn’t even thought about it. We think someone who bought seats
from a season ticketholder we’re friends with ended up grabbing it,' her daughter said.
