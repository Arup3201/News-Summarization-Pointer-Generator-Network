A secret stash of BBC files containing information about journalists and their ties to communism was shredded at the end of the Cold War, according to a former employee.

Michael Hodder, who worked in the organisation's covert vetting unit in the 1980s, before later running the division, has broken his silence on the practice in a bid to repair the reputation of a former colleague, who died last week.

The controversial process saw the BBC scrutinise thousands of people's backgrounds while working alongside MI5 over a period of seven decades.

The BBC destroyed a stash of files at the end of the Cold War after years of vetting current and potential employees for links to communism

When the intrusive process was first exposed by The Observer in 1985, Brigadier Ronnie Stonham, the BBC's liaison with MI5 at the time, saw his reputation tarnished and his career cut short as a result of the revelations.

Speaking to The Times, Mr Hodder - who took over the vetting division from Mr Stonham in 1988 - now wishes to set the record straight in regards to his former friend and colleague.

He said: 'They did not reflect what he was trying to do, which was to cut down on all the vetting.

'He was disappointed that the story had been leaked when all he was trying to do was get the matter progressed and be less of an encumbrance for people at the BBC.'

When Mr Hodder took over he claims he 'shredded the lot' - referring to the secret stash of files.

The documents, amassed over decades, were designed to keep a record of current or potential BBC employees who may have sympathised with extreme left-wing groups.

Mr Hodder claims that when news of the practice was first leaked to the media, the operation had shrunk significantly. 

The former Royal Marine also claims that not one person was blacklisted after being screened in the 17 years that he worked for the company.

The vetting first began in 1937 - initially to ensure that the BBC's staff did not have connections to Oswald Mosley's fascist political party, The British Union of Fascists, also known as the 'Blackshirts'

The secret division operated from room 105 of the BBC's old Broadcasting House and was officially disbanded after the end of the Cold War in 1992 when it was deemed no longer necessary.

The intrusive documents the division produced were known as 'Christmas tree files' because the symbol stamped on the front of the folders resembled one.

The vetting first began in 1937 - initially to ensure that the BBC's staff did not have connections to The British Union of Fascists, led by Oswald Mosley.

The division continued to operate during the Cold War - screening for potential communist sympathisers. Thousands of staff were screened during the its peak.

When The Observer article was published in 1985 the BBC was accused of compromising its journalistic independence by working with MI5.

On the BBC's website an historical entry refers to the scandal, admitting that 'scope of the vetting had become too wide' and that it would have to be scaled back.

The BBC has declined to comment.
