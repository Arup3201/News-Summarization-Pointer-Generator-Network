We are a nation of addicts, struggling to stop ourselves from eating fast food, using Facebook and swearing, a new survey has revealed.

Among other vices is a love of coffee and tea, smoking and chocolate - though these are all things we are trying to give up according to research.

A list of the 50 habits we most want to curb has been compiled after electronic cigarette company, ECigaretteDirect.co.uk, asked 600 adults the things they'd most like to live without.

Addictions to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter were among the top 20 bad habits people are trying to give up

Giving up smoking was the thing people struggled most with, with alcohol and junk food following closely behind.

Reality television, biting fingernails and picking your nose are among the more bizarre bad habits with each appearing in the list's top ten vices.

Cracking knuckles, picking teeth in public and road rage featured further down the list as did obsessive spending and racking up credit card bills.

Racking up credit card bills and, surprisingly, going to the gym were also listed as bad habits people are trying to curb

Unsurprisingly, technology based hang-ups such as Twitter and Google appeared in the top 20, as did addictions to iPads and smartphones. 

While it's easy to see why most things 
on the list would be considered bad habits, others such as going to the 
gym, shaving, and supporting a football team are perhaps not as 
threatening.

A spokesman for the survey said: 'Giving something up takes a lot of willpower and not everyone has the determination to see it through.

'People who canâ€™t give up can consider switching to an alternative, such as switching to artificial sweeteners when giving up sugar, or electronic cigarettes instead of tobacco.'

While many would think it's women who worry most about their figures, one man admitted to constantly trying to ditch junk food in a bid to lose weight.

'Iâ€™ve tried giving up fast food many times but it is just so delicious and there are those nights when you get home from work so late that all you want to do is crash in front of the TV with a bottle of larger and a curry.'

Another woman said that keeping her maiden name was a habit she wanted to get rid of, after becoming too accustomed to it to change once she got married.
