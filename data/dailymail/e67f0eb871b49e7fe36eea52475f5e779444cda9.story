Women between the ages of 18-25 are being targeted more than men as pickpockets travel up to 17 miles to known hotspots

Young women between the ages of 18-24 are being targeted by sinister out of town pickpocketing gangs who are willing to travel up to 17 miles to Britain's hotspots.

Criminals are now choosing to target victims during weekday afternoons in particular, as the number of incidents continues to rise, according to a Home Office report.

Thieves with an average age of 32 travel large distances to seek out people in certain hotspots, with almost half the crimes occurring in London and others in urban areas including Greater Manchester and the West Midlands.

Young women are targeted more than men - and weekend victims tend to be people out on a night out, the report said.

The thefts, which include bag snatching and pickpocketing, rose by 7 per cent throughout last year up to September to 110,000 crimes, according to the figures from the Office for National Statistics.

Pickpockets commonly target people on their own or who have been drinking, and according to the British Transport Police website, mobile phone users should be especially aware of passers by attempting to snatch their gadgets.

Police are encouraging people to keep wallets in their inside pockets, zip up their bags and not to display jewellery too much in public areas.

Figures released in January by British Transport Police showed out of 5,280 reported pickpocketing incidents on the London Underground between November 1, 2012 and October 31, 2013, there were just 170 convictions.
