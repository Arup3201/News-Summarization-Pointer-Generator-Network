A mother was caught giving her four-year-old son 'shots' of beer at a bar before admitting to police that she let him drink wine at home. 

Gretchen Lynn Kinnear, 44, was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor in Fort Mill, South Carolina, according to authorities.

Around 8.30pm on Saturday night, a witness called police from  McHale’s Irish Pub to report a woman giving around three 'shots' of beer to the little boy after staff had asked her to stop.

Kinnear told officers that she had tried some blond ale and gave the four-year-old some of it to drink from a shot glass.

She admitted to having given her son beer before which the child described as 'tea' which made him dizzy and laugh, according to the Charlotte Observer.

The 44-year-old said she also drank wine a couple of times a week at home and gave some to her son - but never to get him drunk.  

A report by York County investigators did not provide reasons as to why the woman gave her son alcohol to drink.

The mother was held at the York County Detention Center before being released on $3,000 bond.

Social services have placed the woman's son in the custody of a couple who regularly babysits the child.
