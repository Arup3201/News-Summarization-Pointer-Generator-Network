William Hague today called on Burma to release all political prisoners and hold fair by-elections - as he became the first British minister to visit the country in 56 years.

The Foreign Secretary met President Thein Sein, who unexpectedly embarked on a series of liberalising measures after coming to office last year, and urged him to continue his reforms.

Hague, who was pictured with pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi this afternoon prior to their formal meeting tomorrow, also spoke with his Myanmar counterpart Wunna Maung Lwin.

At that meeting, which came at the start of the two-day visit, he asked for 'concrete progress' in two other areas - that aid groups have more access to areas of conflict and steps are made to resolve ethnic violence.

And he said that if the pledge for reforms, which began last year with the handing of power to a civilian government, continued then it would lead Burma to have deeper economic and political ties with the West.

Hague's visit is the first by a foreign minister from the former colonial power since 1955, before the military takeover in what was known as Burma in 1962.  

It was made possible by the handover of power last year to a civilian government - albeit one stuffed with former military men and backed by the army - and a series of political and economic reforms since then.   

Hague said of his meeting with the president: 'I emphasised the importance the British Government attaches to the reforms that the Burmese Government has undertaken in the last six months, and my sincere hope that there will be further progress in the weeks and months ahead.

'I made clear that the British Government expects to see the release of all political prisoners, credible by-elections in April, and a genuine alleviation of the suffering in ethnic areas, including through humanitarian access and peace talks.

'I spoke of the long-standing friendship that exists between our two peoples, one that can and should form the foundation of improved relations across the board between our two countries.

'I made clear that the British Government stands ready to respond positively to evidence of further progress towards that lasting improvement in human rights and political freedom that the people of Burma seek.'

And of his meeting with Wunna Maung Lwin, he added: 'I have assured him that if they do (continue the reforms), there will be a strongly positive response from the UK and, I believe, the rest of the European Union.

'The foreign minister has reaffirmed commitments that have been made to release political prisoners.

'He said the changes are irreversible and I welcome that way of thinking. I stressed that the world will judge the government by its actions.'

Hague later spoke with Thura Shwe Mann, the influential speaker of parliament and number three in the former junta.

Shwe Mann then issued a statement acknowledging that not everyone was happy with the number of people released so far.     

He said: 'Our parliament will continue to work so everyone can participate for democracy and development.'

Sustained political reform in Myanmar could pave the way for stiff economic sanctions to end and lead to Western investment in natural resources, including oil and gas and other sectors.    

Myanmar's neighbours in Asia, especially India, Thailand and China, are already rushing to tie up deals.    

Hague's trip follows one late last year by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who promised concrete support from Washington if Myanmar moved faster on political reforms and the release of political prisoners.     

Britain has maintained a tough stand on human rights issues in Myanmar but expressed guarded optimism after the release in October last year of 230 political prisoners.     

Just 12 political detainees were thought to have been freed this week among 900 prisoners released as an Independence Day gesture. As many as 600 may remain behind bars.

Hague is due to hold talks tomorrow with Oxford-educated pro-democracy leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.    

The visit is a tricky balancing act 
for Hague, who will face criticism at home if he is seen as appeasing 
members of the former military regime slammed for its human rights 
record and brutal suppression of dissent.    

Rights violations by the army are still reported from areas where it is fighting ethnic groups.

Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi today said Myanmar's government has approved her National League for Democracy to run in upcoming by-elections.

Suu Kyi said in an interview at her residence that the party had been accepted.

NLD spokesman Nyan Win also said the party will start accepting new members on Monday.

Suu Kyi declined to say if she herself will stand in the election.

The NLD boycotted general elections in 2010 because of restrictions.

Among other things, it would have prevented Suu Kyi from running.

Derek Tonkin, a prominent Myanmar analyst and former British diplomat, said: 'Hague can't appear to go soft. The Burma issue has become a political football at home and if he's not forthright, he will be criticised.

'But there's a feeling that we have been battering away at the Burmese for 22 years and not got anywhere. Britain is very much under the influence of the Americans.'

He also noted that Britain's discouragement of trade, tourism and investment was far heavier than that of the EU in general.    

British firms in the energy and financial services sectors in particular are believed to be interested in Myanmar, but Hague's visit is likely to be little more than a testing of the waters before the EU holds its annual sanctions review in April.    

Mark Farmaner, director of the UK Burma Campaign, said: 'Hague could offer some small concessions but at the moment, he's there to deliver the message that lifting economic sanctions requires more genuine reforms.

'Britain will be very careful. There's broad support for engagement, but I don't think they'll move too fast.'

Analysts said Hague could discuss inducements such as development aid or humanitarian assistance, which, if supported by Suu Kyi, would be more acceptable to activists at home.

Suu Kyi has shown a willingness to compromise in recent months, notably by agreeing to run as a candidate in an April 1 by-election after letting her National League for Democracy (NLD) party re-enter the political process.
