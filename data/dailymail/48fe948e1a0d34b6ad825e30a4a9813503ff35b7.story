A retired teacher and her husband who posed as a wealthy couple to ‘squat’ in luxury properties are back in court.

Hazel and Richard Jerome would make cash offers on expensive houses. Then they would spin lies to explain delays in the purchase, and ask to rent the property until the problems were resolved.

They would move in but not pay any rent, and live free of charge until eventually evicted. They cost one vendor £167,000.

Hazel and Richard Jerome who posed as a wealthy couple to 'squat' in luxury properties are back in court

In 2009 the couple were convicted of fraud and given jail sentences, but allegedly carried on as before, simply switching to a part of the country where they were not known.

The Jeromes, of Chacombe, Oxfordshire, are now on trial at Exeter Crown Court where they have denied eight fraud charges.

Prosecutor Peter Combe told the jury: ‘The two defendants are habitual confidence tricksters. They pose as a wealthy couple who are interested in buying expensive properties.’

He said the couple worked as a team.

While 65-year-old Richard Jerome ‘takes the lead and does the talking’, making out that he has ‘substantial business interests abroad’, Hazel Jerome, 63, plays her part as they tell vendors about their ‘fantastic lifestyle’.

In truth, the court heard, they never had more than £200 in their bank account and lived on Mrs Jerome’s pension.

The Exeter jury has been told about their previous convictions at Huntingdon Crown Court in 2009, relating to two houses.

One couple involved lost £167,000 on the value of their cottage in Buckinghamshire and on unpaid bills and rent. In the other case, it took 12 months to evict them from a property in Milton Keynes.

Jerome, known as Rick, was jailed for 15 months after he admitted fraud and deception, and his wife was given a ten-month suspended term after admitting fraud.

However, the current hearing was told, even while the couple were being investigated for those offences, they were turning their attention to the West Country.

The court heard that the Jeromes made an offer of £310,000 on a house in East Looe, Cornwall, saying they wanted it as their UK base because they lived for six months each year in Barbados.

They blamed delays in the deal on Jerome being seriously ill, and the ‘purchase’ was still going on when the couple admitted fraud at Huntingdon Crown Court.

However the seller read newspaper reports about the case and was able to bale out without losing much money.

Not long after Jerome was released from jail, the couple targeted a £750,000 clifftop house with stunning sea views in Sidmouth, Devon, using the false surname of Ausson, the jury heard.

They made another series of excuses for delays in the purchase, blaming solicitors and illness, but a surveyor they failed to pay for his work discovered their real identities and contacted police.

In interviews Jerome refused to comment. His wife denied any fraud and said she lived off her state and teacher’s pensions.

She said they wanted to buy a retirement home in the West Country for £300,000 or more and was told by her husband that his offshore company would make the purchase.

But the court heard that bank statements showed he never had more than £200 in his account.

The trial continues.
