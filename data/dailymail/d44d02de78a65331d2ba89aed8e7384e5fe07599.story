A antiques shop owner has banned tourists from his store after claiming they never buy anything and put off genuine local customers.

Mark Galpin claims his profits have risen by 30 per cent since he put up a sign outside the shop door which reads 'No Tourists.'

It also states that only people who live within a 30 mile radius of his shop are welcome to his Aladdin's Cave store in Christchurch, Dorset.

Mark Galpin has put up a sign outside the front door of his furniture and antiques shop in Christchurch, Dorset, which reads in bold letters 'No Tourists'

Mr Galpin claims tourists use his shop to kill time while they wait for their buses home and says they put off genuine customers

If Mr Galpin does not recognise a customer, he quizzes them on who they are and where they are from.

He became fed-up with coach loads of 'time-wasting' tourists who browse around his furniture and antiques shop while they wait for their bus home.

Footfall has dropped by 90 per cent since Mr Galpin brought in the policy a month ago but he claims he is making more money off genuine customers.

He said he is willing to alter his stance if tourists pay a pound to enter, which they will get back if they buy something.

But the shop owner has been labelled 'eccentric' by his local chamber of commerce who fear the move will put people off visiting the town.

Mr Galpin, who is in his 60s, said: 'We have made a decision that this business should be a local business for local people.

'We have a coach drop-off and pick-up point immediately opposite us and we can have 500 to 600 coach passengers a day coming in and buying absolutely nothing.

'We have put up with it for three years and we believe that maybe one in every 2,500 tourists has spent a pound or two. The rest have spent nothing.

The sign reads: 'Regretably [sic] we no longer allow tourists entry as furniture too large to take on coach'

'We have really tried to cater for tourists by selling small trinkets and ornaments for a few pounds but they are not interested in buying.

'We have also had at least 45 to 50 local residents tell us they avoid coming in to our shop when it's busy.

'It was having a huge detrimental impact on our business so we decided to make it a local business for local people.

'We are an independent retailer, we pay extremely high rents and rates for being in the high street.

'We think that giving tourists an option of coming in if they pay a pound to an extremely worthwhile charity is the right thing to do.'

Customer Anthony Nichols, who was ejected from the shop after admitting he was not a local resident, said: 'He said that before I could come in I had to read this sign, which said that tourists were banned.

Some officials fear that Mr Galpin's actions will put visitors off Christchurch (file photo)

'At first I thought he was joking. We were actually looking for a piece of furniture on behalf of a Christchurch-based relative but I didn't see why I should have to explain that to him.

'We had had a lovely time in Christchurch but that's not what I will be taking away from me.

'This has ruined that. I cannot understand how he is allowed to act like this.'

Some residents fear Mr Galpin's actions will damage the reputation of Christchurch.

Cllr Nicholas Geary said: 'We're working very hard to encourage people to come into our town and spend money and this attitude does us no good at all.'

Peter Watson-Lee, chairman of the Christchurch Chamber of Trade, said: 'We are working hard to get people to come to the town and it's just so depressing that we have got one eccentric trader taking this stance.

Peter Watson-Lee, chairman of the Christchurch Chamber of Trade, said Mr Galpin was 'in the wrong town' if he didn't want to welcome tourists (file photo)

'I've had a whole series of complaints from people but he won't listen.

'It's totally contrary to everything that the traders stand for.

'Tourists bring a lot of money into the town. He is in the wrong town if he doesn't want to welcome them."

Matti Raudsepp, head of leisure at Christchurch Borough Council, said: 'We would like to reassure tourists that they are more than welcome to come to Christchurch.'
