Patrick Kluivert says Louis van Gaal can turn Manchester United into a Premier League title-winning team and that 'there's still a long way to go' this season.

The former Holland assistant manager says Van Gaal's tricky start to life in the Premier League is because he arrived at Old Trafford directly from the World Cup in Brazil.

United sit fourth after beating West Ham and Everton 2-1 apiece and Kluivert says it's just a matter of time before Van Gaal makes his presence felt at the top of the Premier League.

Patrick Kluivert believes Van Gaal can turn Manchester United into a Premier League title-winning team

'He came a little bit later from the World Cup and going directly to a new club, with new personnel, new players, it needs time,' says Kluivert, according to the Daily Mirror.

'The last two results were positive and if you have positive results, it flows back on the team.

'I think that's the most important thing. So I think the people don't have to be scared that Manchester United is not going to do well.

'(Manchester) City and Chelsea and a few more teams have got good squads. They're doing very well at the moment, but there's still a long way to go.

'But sure they can be a contender to be the champions. It will be very difficult, but it's possible.' 

Van Gaal and his £401.2million-valued squad, the most expensive ever assembled in Premier League history, return after the international break to face West Brom at the Hawthorns.
