A rare emerald, pearl and diamond necklace fit for royalty is being  sold by auction house Bonhams.

The unique gems are expected to fetch between £120-000 to 180,000 after being put on sale by an anonymous seller.

The rare item of jewellery dates back to 1911 and is believed to have been worn at the Delhi Durbar, meaning 'Court of Delhi', a glittering event held in India to celebrate the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary as Emperor and Empress of India.

The necklace dates back to 1911 and would have been worn by an Indian prince or other highly ranked VIP

A spokesman for Bonhams said they do not know who wore the stunning necklace but it would have either been a member of royalty or a VIP with a high enough status to attend such a lavish event. 

They added: 'We feel very privileged to be selling a remarkable and rare piece linked to historic days of Indian Royalty.'

The one of a kind necklace is part of Bonham's fine jewellery sale on the 4th of December at their Bond Street salerooms.

The chain of the necklace is made up of multiple small diamonds and emeralds which support a pendant dominated by a central fluted emerald of approximately seven carats. 

Strings of pearls dangle from the back of the necklace where it is clasped. 

Decadent: The necklace has strings of pearls at the back even though they would not have been that noticeable when worn

Unique item: The jewels are expected to fetch £120-000 to 180,000

Bonhams said the addition of the pearls at the back, which would not have been very visible when worn, show how the necklace is an 'unmistakeable statement of wealth, bejeweled on every bit of its surface'.

Jean Ghika, head of jewellery UK and Europe, said: 'This necklace provides us with a unique insight into the levels of opulence and display at the 1911 Delhi Durbar and it is extremely rare to have such a magnificent jewel survive intact.

'The necklace is not only fascinating historically but is also in superb condition. This is a singular opportunity to purchase a beautifully made historic jewel, the quality and lavishness of which we rarely see in jewellery nowadays.'

King George V and Queen Mary at the Delhi Durbar in 1911: The queen wore her own emerald and diamond necklace to the historic event

Paying homage: Every ruling prince, nobleman, landed gentry and other persons of note in India attended - and one of them would have been wearing the necklace that is now being auctioned

The briolette cut style of the necklace with a pear shape pendant was popular in Indian jewellery during the time of the British Empire.

Queen Mary had a similar diamond and emerald necklace of her own which she wore to the Delhi Durbar and has since been passed down to Queen Elizabeth II who continues to where it on formal occasions.

Bids for the sale are being accepted online at the Bonhams website, via telephone, and in writing and also in the saleroom on the day of the sale. 

The Delhi Durbar was a lavish mass assembly at Coronation Park, Delhi, India. It was held three times in 1877, 1903, and 1911 at the height of the British Empire.

The 1911 Durbar, the most glittering assemblage of the three, was held to commemorate the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary as Emperor and Empress of India. 

Nearly every ruling prince, nobleman, landed gentry and other persons of note in India attended to pay homage to their sovereigns.

The King and Queen appeared in their Coronation robes, the King-Emperor wearing the Imperial Crown of India containing six thousand one hundred and seventy diamonds and covered with sapphires, emeralds and rubies.
