Television psychic Derek Acorah today denied claiming missing Madeleine McCann was dead and 'has been over in the spirit world for some time' in a newspaper interview.

The medium, 62, said he would fly to Portugal to join the hunt for the missing girl and turn his findings over to police.

Mr Acorah allegedly told The Sun that Madeleine, who vanished five years ago, would be reincarnated before long.

'In the spirit world': Derek Acorah, right, is joining the search for Madeleine McCann and claims she will be reincarnated as another little girl

He was quoted as saying: 'I know her 
parents are convinced Maddie is alive and I'm really sorry - but the 
little one has been over in the spirit world for some time.

'I don't think she will be there long before she reincarnates.

'When children pass over who haven't 
had full lives I believe they choose the time to come back in the same 
form again - as another little girl.'

When contacted by the MailOnline 
today, he said that 'no one knows' if the schoolgirl is dead.

Mr Acorah refused to repeat the comments and said he had been 
'misquoted' by The Sun.

He said he would fly to Praia da Luz to see if 'the spirits' can solve the mystery of what happened.

Critics have questioned why the 
television psychic has waited until now to join the search for the 
missing child - as he promotes a theatre tour.

Psychic Derek - who used to host TV's Most Haunted - was allegedly exposed as a fraud by psychologist Dr Ciaran O'Keeffe.

While filming at Bodmin gaol in 
Cornwall he said he was being possessed by Kreed Kafer - an anagram of 
Derek Faker - which Dr O'Keeffe had invented and mentioned when he was 
within earshot.

Anguish: Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann with a picture of their daughter as she would appear aged nine. They have never given up hope that she is still alive

Scotland Yard have recently carried out a £2million review of the evidence in the case.

Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann have always insisted that their missing daughter may still be alive.

Mr Acorah said that he is happy to join the hunt to find her.

'I am willing to go over to Portugal to help search for Madeleine. I will go to 
the place where she went missing and see what I can pick up.

'I
would ask the world of spirits in the area what happened and anything I found out I
would pass over to police to help with their investigation.'

He added that he had been 'stitched up'.

'I have been totally and utterly misquoted. I am a very sensitive person and the last thing I would do is to force my beliefs on other people.

'I hope and believe Madeleine is alive.'

Mr Acorah said there were four mediums in Portugal at the time and he 'didn't want to get in their way'.

'It was in my mind to go over and 
search for Madeleine when she first disappeared but there were already 
four mediums over there,' he added.

'I was surplus to requirements and I'm not going to be getting in another medium's ground.'

The £2million police review of the Madeleine McCann case will examine calls from psychics which were previously ignored, it has been revealed.

Detectives are studying around 100 logs of calls that were discounted because the callers said they were psychics or had dreamt about the high-profile investigation.

Critics said the decision to include information from ‘supernatural’ sources was a waste of resources.

Scotland Yard officers who have been 
called in to review the case last month released a new picture of how 
Madeleine would look now as a nine-year-old.

A team of 35 Metropolitan Police officers are examining more than 100 leads as they renew the hunt for the missing child.
