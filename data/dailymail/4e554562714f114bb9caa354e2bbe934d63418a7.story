Criticism: A Fox News guest criticiised Anthony Foxx (pictured), President Obama's transportation nominee on Thursday, saying that his declaration of a National Day of Reason was an example of the type of thinking that led to the Holocaust

A chief executive of a Christian womens' group in America has accused President Barack Obama's transportation nominee of endorsing a type of thinking which led to the Holocaust.

Speaking on Fox news, guest 
Penny Nance, said she didn't understand why Anthony Foxx wanted a National Day of Reason as well as a National Day of Prayer.

Mr Nance, who is the chief executive of Concerned Women for America, said 'dark periods of history had been caused by leaving God out of the equation.'

She said: 'You know, G. K. Chesterton said that
 the Doctrine of Original Sin is the only one which we have 3,000 years 
of empirical evidence to back up.

'Clearly, we need faith as a component 
and itâ€™s just silly for us to say otherwise.

'You know, the Age 
of Enlightenment and Reason gave way to moral relativism. And moral 
relativism is what led us all the way down the dark path to the 
Holocaust.'

Mr Foxx, the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Obama's pick to head the Department of Transportation issued a proclamation for the National Day Of Reason in his city following the National Day of Prayer on Thursday.

It is the second year that Foxx has endorsed the National Day of Reason, which advocates the separation of church and state, in Charlotte.

The proclaimation read: 'The application of reason, more than any other means, has proven to offer hope for human survival on Earth.'

Angry: Fox News guest, Penny Nance, criticised Anthony Foxx on the Fox and Friends show saying that his declaration of a National Day of Reason was an example of the type of thinking that led to the Holocaust
