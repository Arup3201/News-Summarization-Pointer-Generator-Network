Fraud: Robert Santangelo, 41, pictured, posed as a Help for Heroes charity collector and claimed to have served in the army - when he was actually in prison

A conman who said he had served in the army when he was actually in prison has been spared jail for conning people into giving him donations for charity Help for Heroes.

Despite admitting his deceit - and a string of 48 previous convictions - Robert Santangelo, 41, was spared jail.

He told rail commuters that he was collecting on behalf of war-wounded soldiers - despite being struck off by the charity months before.

Suspicious travellers at Weeley Railway Station, near Clacton, Essex, raised the alarm after spotting the defendant drinking cans of beer whilst offering out Help for Heroes charity wristbands.

When confronted by a railway enforcement officer in December last year, he said: 'How about I smash your f*cking face in?'

During an interview following his arrest, Santangelo told detectives about his military record serving with the parachute regiment in Rwanda - though further investigation revealed the regiment had not been stationed there since 1994.

Police officers could not find any trace of his military past and discovered he had actually been serving a four-month prison sentence when he claimed to have been serving his country.

Santangelo had previously had his 
permission to collect revoked after being found drunk while collecting 
for the charity in Newquay, Cornwall.

Santangelo, from Colchester, Essex, pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud by false representation and a further charge of using threatening and abusive language at an earlier hearing at North Essex Magistrates’ Court.

Despite 48 previous offences - including dishonesty, battery, criminal damage and theft - Santangelo was let off with an eight-month sentence suspended for 12 months when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday.

Judge Anthony Goldstaub QC - who had deferred sentencing to review how Santangelo was dealing with drug and alcohol problems - said: 'You are making slow progress, but it is in the right direction.'

Bryn Parry, CEO and Co-Founder of Help for Heroes, said the charity has no record of ever receiving funds from Santangelo.

He said: 'To date Help for Heroes have not been able to trace any donations from Mr Santangelo, and would like to take this opportunity to state their view on people who fraudulently and greedily take funds for their own use, that are given generously by the British public and intended to support the wounded.

'This undermines the thousands of 
generous and committed fundraisers across the UK who enabled Help for 
Heroes to commit £131m to provide practical and direct support to the 
wounded.'

Help for 
Heroes was founded by Bryn and Emma Parry in October 2007 with an aim of
helping wounded Servicemen and women returning from Afghanistan and 
Iraq.

In June 2011 the 
charity celebrated breaking the £100 million mark thanks to a tide of 
public support and fundraising events across the country.
