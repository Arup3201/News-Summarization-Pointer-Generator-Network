British police should be dispatched to Turkey to catch ISIS sympathisers travelling to Syria, MPs said today.

Home Affairs committee chairman Keith Vaz said police 'spotters' were needed in Istanbul amid growing numbers of fanatics using the city as a gateway to the frontline in neighbouring Syria.

It comes after three London schoolgirls were spotted in the city on the Turkish leg of their trip before they were feared to have crossed the border into Syria.

Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs she was in talks with Turkish airlines to ramp up security to catch women and girls travelling to Syria

Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs she was in talks with Turkish airlines to ramp up security amid evidence that there are an 'increasing number of women and girls' travelling to join ISIS.

She said should would look 'with very great care' at Mr Vaz's call for British police to be stationed in Istanbul.

It came after Mrs May was called to the House of Commons to give an urgent statement on the terror threat in the wake of last week's revelation that the ISIS executioner known as 'Jihadi John' was the London-raised university graduate Mohammed Emwazi.

The Home Secretary said she would look 'with very great care' at Mr Vaz's call for British police to be stationed in Istanbul.

Mr Vaz said: 'I'm sure that the Home Secretary has heard the anguished pleas of the parents of the three London schoolgirls who have left this country.

'Will she look at a recommendation that was made by the Home Affairs Select Committee which is that police spotters need to be placed in Istanbul because this is the destination of concern – so that there can be immediate action taken if young girls disappear in this way.'

Mrs May said: 'We have seen over time an increasing number of women and girls going to Syria, alongside the men and boys that we have seen going previously.

'It's an ongoing issue – that's why it is the case that Home Office officials have been speaking to Turkish airlines about these issues.

'I will be meeting and talking to the Transport Secretary whether there are further arrangements that can be put in place to ensure we don't see families facing the trauma and stress that these families are.'

At least 60 women and girls, including 18 under the age of 20, have travelled to join ISIS, a senior counter-terror officer has revealed.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball, the Metropolitan Police's National Coordinator Counter Terrorism coordinator, urged the travel industry and families to be 'vigilant' in the battle to stop young people from flying to join the jihadists in Iraq and Syria.

She told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC One: 'The reason we are so worried about it is in the last year 22 young women have travelled, all but four if those 22 were ahead 20 or younger. The last five who have travelled were aged 15 or 16.

'This is a growing problem and it's one of real concern. The more everybody involved in travel understands this problem and can be alerted and vigilant the better. There are police powers. There is a new police power to remove someone's passport if we are concerned that they might be travelling for terrorist purposes. We have used that already.

'Mostly this is about the level of vigilance of everybody who is working in the industry and an understanding that actually some of these women and girls are very carefully prepared for their travel so they don't stand out. They take unusual routes and it is very had to spot them.

'60 women and girls have travelled. 22 much younger have been reported by their families who are absolutely distraught.'
