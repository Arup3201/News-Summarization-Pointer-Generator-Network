One man is impressing women all over the world with his ultimate Valentine's Day serenade.

Anthony Vincent, 26, from Port Chester, New York, is a YouTube star who made his name singing famous pop songs in the style of completely different musicians. 

Last Christmas, he released a cover of Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You, sung in the voice of Usher, Blink 182, Imagine Dragons, Usher and many others.

After a couple of months in the studio, the singer is back with a new compilation for Valentine's Day.

In less than four minutes the dishevelled rocker manages to belt out 20 of his favourite love songs in 20 different styles which all seem to go remarkably well together. 

The video below, which he has published on his channel Ten Second Songs, was made in a recording studio in Port Chester, a small town 30 miles north of New York City, where Anthony works in one of the production rooms.

The internet star first made waves online with his rendition of Katy Perry's Dark Horse last spring and has gone on to experiment with numerous artist impressions.

The tattooed singer demonstrates a talent for being able to impersonate most singers from every genre - rock to swing and even hip hop.

In his new love song medley he weaves together 20 different songs all sung in the style of radically different artists including Frank Sinatra, Rick Astley, Bon Jovi and Ed Sheeran.

Featuring everything from a Boyz II Men version of Hozier's Take Me To Church to a rendition of The Beatles' Something in the voice of Bon Jovi, the clip manages to be both romantic and skillful. 

It also features unlikely fusions like a Metallica version of The Way You Look Tonight 

Anthony takes the style of each artist and adapts it to suit another song.

He writes: 'I hope you all enjoy my Valentines Day themed video. 

'I tried something a little different this time and covered 20 love songs in 20 different styles.' 

His Dark Horse reimaging, with its dead-on impressions of Kurt Cobain, Michael Jackson, Run DMC and Metallica went viral and earned him 1million YouTube views in less than a week.
