A farmer has launched an eleventh-hour appeal to stop his secretly built castle in Surrey from being demolished.

Robert Fidler, 64, built the castle, complete with ramparts and cannon, on his land in Redhill, in 2001.

But he initially concealed it under a 40ft-high stack of hay bales until eight years ago - by which time he believed he would be immune from planning rules.

'It's my home': Robert Fidler built the castle, Honeycrock Farmhouse, complete with ramparts and cannon in 2001

Robert Fidler attempted to hide the castle behind 40ft-high stacks of hay bales after he began renovations in 2001

But Reigate and Banstead Borough Council in Surrey refused him retrospective planning permission and a long-running battle began over his four-bed mock-Tudor home, Honeycrock Farmhouse.

Now a planning inspector has begun hearing his latest appeal against refusal of planning consent.

This time his claim relates to agricultural need as he and his wife Laura keep a herd of Sussex cattle at the farm and are using reason this to halt demolition.

It is believed this could be the couple's last chance of saving their castle.

The Reigate and Banstead Borough Council said Honeycrock Farmhouse does not abide by planning laws and wants it town down

Mr Fidler said: 'We have done nothing wrong. We have never broken any laws, contrary to what the authorities seem to be trying to suggest.

'All I have done is provided my family with a home to live in.

'For the few years before we did that, we were living in a shed in the corner of the yard.'

Mr Fidler, who has been farming on his land at Salfords, Surrey for 40 years, was first ordered to demolish the castle in 2007.

Castle luxury: Robert Fidler said he has not broken the law and just wanted to provide a house for his family to live in

Robert Fidler was given a 90-day demolition notice to tear down the castle in June after the council obtained a High Court injunction

He and his wife have lost a number of appeals to stop the bulldozers.

In February this year, he submitted a new planning application to save the property on grounds of agricultural need. But this was refused by the council's planning committee on April 9.

Then on June 13, the council obtained a High Court injunction requiring Mr Fidler to comply with four outstanding enforcement notices to demolish the house.

He was given a 90-day demolition order, which the current hearing is concerned with.

A spokesman for Reigate and Banstead Borough Council said: 'We will not be commenting on the case while it is going on.'
