Harry Kane was 'remarkable' as Tottenham secured a north London derby win that Ryan Mason says has the top-four contenders abuzz with excitement.

Arsenal made the short journey to White Hart Lane looking for a sixth straight win and got off to the ideal start as Mesut Ozil volleyed home.

Spurs, though, responded manfully, peppering the visitors' goal before Kane finally beat David Ospina shortly after half-time.

Things were to get better still for Mauricio Pochettino's men as the in-form England Under-21s striker continued his superb recent form, heading home at the death to secure a 2-1 win in his first north London derby.

'He is remarkable,' Mason of his friend and team-mate. 'He leads the line on his own and does it unbelievably well.

'You can see the way he is at the moment that he is one fire and can't stop scoring.'

Kane now has 22 goals in all competitions this season, with that fine form keeping marquee signings like Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor out of the side.

They are, though, more than capable back-ups, with Spurs boasting a squad depth which makes Mason confident they can qualify for the Champions League.

'We believe - of course we do,' he said. 'We did the same thing to Chelsea a little while ago and hopefully we can keep doing well and stay up there.

'It will be difficult (to make the top four) but we are confident in ourselves.

'We're on a good run and the team spirit is amazing. Everyone gets on with each other well.

'It is great to come in off the back of a win and we are buzzing. It's a great feeling.'
