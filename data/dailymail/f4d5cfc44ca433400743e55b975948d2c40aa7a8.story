Lee Peltier has confirmed he is leaving Championship club Leeds after his contract was cut short by mutual consent.

The 27-year-old former Whites captain has a year left on his deal at Elland Road but is now looking for a new club after agreeing to leave at the end of a season where he fell out of favour.

He was signed by former Leeds boss Neil Warnock in 2012 but struggled to get into Brian McDermott's side last season before moving to Nottingham Forest on loan.

Red alert: Peltier could make a move to Nottingham Forest where he made seven appearances on loan

Peltier tweeted on Monday: 'All the fans that have supported me over the two years, and all the boys at the club been a pleasure working with them - top lads, wish them all the best for the season.'

Forest are believed to be interested in securing a permanent deal for the former Leicester and Huddersfield man.

Peltier had been a regular in the side at Elland Road and was even appointed captain at one point but now seems not to be in new manager Dave Hockaday's plans for the coming season.

He leaves Leeds having made 75 appearances for the club, scoring one goal.
