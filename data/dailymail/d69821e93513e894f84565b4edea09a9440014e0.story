Ann Salter: The former BBC presenter, pictured, falsely claimed that she was too ill to work

A former BBC presenter faces a possible jail sentence for falsely claiming more than £65,000 in benefits while insisting she was unable to work.

Ann Salter said she was suffering from depression, but was caught after she posted a showreel online as part of a curriculum vitae covering her work on television and radio.

The 49-year-old, who described herself as an ‘experienced and glamorous presenter’, recorded her jobs including hosting motorsports coverage on Channel 5 and working as an anchor on Setanta Sports News.

The list included guest presenting on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour and BBC Radio 5 Live, as well as work on The Travel Channel and Sky Sports. She also boasted about jobs at ‘red carpet soirees’ and Armani fashion shows, and hosting car launches in Cannes.

Miss Salter, who said she had a ‘love of the fast-moving, exotic and challenging’, wrote that her career began in regional television news. According to her presenting profile, which described her as an ‘accomplished journalist’, she has ‘undertaken fearless, ground-breaking investigations’.

The presenter, who lives in Shepperton, Surrey, with her partner, had told the Department for Work and Pensions and Spelthorne Borough Council that she was unfit for work because of depression.

But she posted videos online showcasing some of her television work, as well as clips of her as the voiceover on a number of adverts.

Miss Salter pleaded guilty at Guildford Crown Court to falsely claiming £65,478.95 in benefits since 2005 and will be sentenced later this month. She wrongly received £30,127.91 in housing benefit, £28,126.90 in income support and £7,224.15 in council tax benefit – and will have to pay back all the money. 

It comes as Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said yesterday that the welfare state has been seen by criminals as a ‘money-making scam’ and warned benefit cheats they will not get away with it.

Figures show £1.2billion was lost to fraud last year, a figure which has remained stubbornly high. Ministers argue that the move to Universal Credit – combining several benefits into one, with live updates on personal circumstances – will make it easier to catch benefit cheats.

Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘We know that the vast majority of people play by the rules. However, benefit fraud is a serious crime and I’m determined to root out the unscrupulous minority who are cheating money out of hardworking taxpayers and diverting it from those who need it most.

‘Some people see the welfare state as a money-making scam, but I have a simple message for them: you will not get away with it.

‘Last year we recouped over a billion pounds, but we want to go further to toughen up the system giving our fraud investigators greater powers. Universal Credit will make it harder to commit benefit fraud in the first place and easier to detect.’

Work and Pensions minister Mark Harper added: ‘Most people claiming benefits are honest and play by the rules, but as with cases like [Miss Salter’s], it’s astonishing that some people shamelessly abuse our welfare system, diverting funds from the people who need it most.’

Richard West, of the DWP fraud and error service, said: ‘Anyone found guilty of fraud will have to pay the stolen money back and under tougher new rules they will have to do so more quickly – that’s on top of any prison sentence or fine …

‘These cases send a clear message to any criminals cheating the system that we have the means to catch them and bring them to justice.’
