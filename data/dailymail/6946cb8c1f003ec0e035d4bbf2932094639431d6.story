Too young: Cara Delevingne in a Mulberry advert

Mulberry handbags have long been a proud example of the best of British craftsmanship and are one of the most coveted designer brands.

From the butter-soft leathers that give the Bayswater and the Alexa their characteristic luxuriant slouch to the discreet functionality of their classic Clipper holdalls, Mulberry is one of our most desired labels.

But everything is not rosy in the company’s Somerset home. On the stock market, its share price fell by a quarter in recent days — from being worth £1.5 billion in its heyday, the value has dropped to around £400 million.

Those stark figures hint at trouble afoot.

And it’s no surprise: the classic Bayswater bag, beloved by middle-class mums everywhere, cost £495 five years ago.

Now it is at least £895 for the basic edition, with most Bayswaters priced at more than £1,100. Not surprisingly, this has driven away many of the brand’s core fans.

Fashion experts pinpoint the change to the arrival of a new French CEO 18 months ago.

Bruno Guillon — hailing from the snootiest of French brands, Hermes — has been accused of having little understanding of Mulberry’s British character.

He has determinedly driven the brand from upmarket, aspirational luxury to the stratospheric end of the price scale.

Guillon is said to be determined to take Mulberry from its cosy, country roots into the same category as brands such as Chanel and Louis Vuitton.

And it’s not just the classic Bayswater handbag.

Today, Mulberry’s small Lily evening bag is £750 — six months ago, it was £595.

An Alexa tote in oak buffalo is £1,100 — a couple of years ago, it was £795. In ostrich, rather than leather? That will be £4,500, thank you.

The cheapest bag is a tiny Bayswater clutch at £495. Still want to buy into Mulberry? You can always pick up a leather keyring for £60.

Top personal shopper Gabrielle Teare thinks Mulberry is out of the reach of the vast majority of shoppers, creating serious problems for the brand.

Her clients are busy spending their money at Dior — the irony being that while Mulberry reaches a level where its core British market can no longer afford it, its manufacturing quality and breadth of design simply are not up to scratch in the international luxury market.

‘Prices are off the scale,’ she says. ‘They compete with Dior and Hermes, but they’re just not as innovative.’

Mulberry is clearly no longer the cottage industry that founder Roger Saul began in Somerset in 1971 with a £500 gift from his father.

Since a takeover in 2002, growth — and serious profit — has been high on the agenda.

Mulberry issued it-bag after it-bag — the Roxanne, the Bayswater, the Alexa, the Del Rey — and courted the celebrities of the moment.

Prices crept up of course, and then the Emerald City hove into view: Asia, the great hope of every luxury brand with Hong Kong dollar signs in its eyes.

Yet, while they price their products for rich Chinese shoppers, Britain still represents the majority of Mulberry’s customer base, as well as providing its design DNA and international kudos.

Indeed, a newly opened second Somerset factory is helping achieve the company’s aim of making half of its goods in Britain.

But Mulberry’s British fanbase has noticed the change — the new bag they save up for over  a number of years has gone up by hundreds of pounds. And they’re turning their back on the brand as a result. 

Business experts, meanwhile, suggest Mulberry should reduce its bag prices to between £200 and £600, to compete with the middle-market likes of Coach and Michael Kors.

Not that there’s anything wrong in seeking new customers, but constantly raising prices to generate exclusivity surely underestimates the intelligence and tolerance of its customers.

Mulberry’s obsession with celebrity may also be problematic: Teare believes that the young, hip likes of Cara Delevingne, Alexa Chung and Lana Del Rey, alienate its more ‘grown-up’ customers.

It’s a fair point: the young might be more reckless spenders, but they  are less well-cushioned from hard times than their parents and grandparents, less equipped to recover, and have less cash to spend.

So, where can Mulberry fans go if they can’t face the prices?

I’d point to Jaeger, another British brand that suffered mixed fortunes as it aimed for a cooler international crowd, is now back on track as it targets a homegrown, older, more affluent market.

If you love the Bayswater, £895, go for Jaeger’s Montalba Tote instead, at £299.

Fans of the £1,100 Del Rey should take a look at the Penney, on sale in luscious tomato red at £149.

And instead of a Clemmie clutch, £595, go for the Olivia box clutch at Jaeger, on sale for just £30.

Jaeger understands that biting the hand that feeds you is an easy route to starvation. Mulberry might take note.
