President Barack Obama today said the investigation into police in Ferguson, Missouri, has exposed a 'broken and racially biased system' as he prepared to mark a half-century since 'Bloody Sunday'.

Addressing a South Carolina town hall, the 53-year-old leader also said the inquiry - launched in the wake of Michael Brown's 2014 death - has revealed an 'oppressive and abusive' police situation.

'It turns out they weren't just making it up. This was happening,' Obama said, making reference to the  Justice Department's damning report on blacks-targeted racial bias in the St Louis suburb.

He told a room of both young and old attendees that Ferguson must now decide how to move forward, adding that America's top goal should be to prevent similar circumstances elsewhere.

'Are they going to enter into some sort of agreement with the Justice Department to fix what is clearly a broken and racially biased system?' he asked of officials who are working in the city.

Obama's comments at South Carolina's Benedict College come the day before he leads this weekend's 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday', when police beat scores of people marching from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, the state capital, to protest against their lack of voting rights.

The violent images broadcast on TV helped lead to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 

During today's gathering, Obama made his most expansive comments yet about the Justice Department report, which found systemic racial bias  created a 'toxic environment' in Ferguson.

The President, who arrived at Columbia Metropolitan Airport on Air Force One earlier today, said it was striking investigators had merely had to look at emails sent by police  to find evidence of bias.

The report cleared Darren Wilson, the white former Ferguson police officer who shot to death 18-year-old Brown, who was black and unarmed, while he was on duty in the city in August 2014.

Damning report: 'It turns out they weren't just making it up. This was happening,' Obama said, making reference to the Justice Department's damning report on blacks-targeted racial bias in the St Louis suburb

Future decisions: Obama (pictured today) told a room of both young and old attendees that Ferguson must now decide how to move forward, adding that America's top goal is to prevent similar circumstances elsewhere

Shooting: But Obama said he fully supported the decision not to charge officer Darren Wilson (right) in the death of Michael Brown (left) 'You can't just charge him anyway because what happened was tragic,' he said

Obama said he fully supported the decision not to charge Wilson - something that led to nationwide protests - telling attendees: 'You can't just charge him anyway because what happened was tragic.'

He added: 'That was the decision that was made, and I have complete confidence and stand fully behind the decision that was made by the Justice Department on that issue.' 

However, in a separate report, federal investigators found patterns of racial profiling, bigotry and profit-driven law enforcement and court practices within the Ferguson Police Department.

Shockingly, Obama himself was the subject of some of the racist emails from Ferguson police and municipal courts employees that were uncovered in the investigation.

A 2008 email said Obama would not be president for long because 'what black man holds a steady job for four years,' while another depicted the politician as a chimpanzee.

Although Obama said he did not think what happened in Ferguson was typical of the rest of the country, he added that it was not an isolated incident, either.

He called for communities to work together to address tensions between police and locals without succumbing to cynical attitudes that say 'this is never going to change, because everybody's racist.'

'That's not a good solution,' Obama said. 'That's not what the folks in Selma did.'

During his speech at the college, the President also hinted at what he will speak about on Edmund Pettus Bridge tomorrow, which is the 50th anniversary of the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march.

He said the commemoration is as much about stirring young people to change as it is about honoring past legends - and about 'the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things'.

'Selma is not just about commemorating the past, it's about honoring the legends who helped change this country through your actions today, in the here and now,' Obama said.

'Selma is about the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things because they believe they can change the country, they can shape our nation's destiny.

'Selma's about each of us asking ourselves what we can do to make America better. And historically, it's been young people like you who help lead that march.'

He added: 'It was young people who stubbornly insisted on justice', noting that one of the most famous leaders of the Selma march - now Georgia Rep. John Lewis - was just 23  at the time.

Arrival: The visit was Obama's first to South Carolina as President. South Dakota and Utah are now the only states he has not traveled to while in office. Above, the President arrives at Columbia Metropolitan Airport

'[They] stubbornly refused to accept the world as it is that transformed not just the country but transformed the world,' he concluded.

The visit was Obama's first to South Carolina as President. South Dakota and Utah are now the only states he has not traveled to while in office.

In a radio interview broadcast earlier today, Obama said improving civil rights and liberties with police is an area that 'requires collective action and mobilization'.

He also spoke again of the Justice Department report, which hit the headlines this week after finding police officers routinely discriminated against blacks in Ferguson by using excessive force.

'I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident,' Obama said  on The Joe Madison Radio Show on Sirius XM radio's Urban View channel.

He explained: 'I think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down, and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure that they're protecting and serving all people and not just some.' 

Ferguson's city leaders are scheduled to meet with department officials in around two weeks.

During the meeting, they are expected to put forward an improvement plan.
