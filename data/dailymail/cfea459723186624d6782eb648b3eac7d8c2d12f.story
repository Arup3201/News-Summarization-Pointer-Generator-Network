Tragic: Ian Woolston lost his life after a horrific accident while exploring the site of fallen German U-boat

A diver has lost his life after losing his air supply 150ft underwater while exploring the wreck of a German U-boat. 

Rescue boat crew tried to resuscitate Ian Woolston for 30 minutes who was then taken by a rescue helicopter and
raced to a pressure chamber in Dundee but could not be saved.

Mr Woolston, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, lost his air supply
150ft down and may have suffered a fatal case of the bends as he was 
sent to the surface to avoid drowning.

Decompression illness - otherwise known 
as the 'bends' - is when small gas bubbles form in the blood as a diver 
rises to the surface, blocking circulation to the brain.

The diver was seen frantically signalling to his dive partner that he was returning to the surface.

His partner then tried to help him upwards as he pushed him towards the surface.

Mr Woolston was part of a seven-strong expedition visiting the remains of a U-boat 
which was sunk almost 100 years ago with the loss of 19 lives.

On
his Facebook page the keen diver was excited by the trip after having a
previous expedition cancelled and had been posting about his up and 
coming adventure.

He wrote: 'Another dive trip cancelled due to the weather. Bollox.'We were going to Eyemouth to do the Exmouth, we are still on for tomorrow though to do the U12.

'I need to get to Divers today and get an 80 per cent fill in my stage, I was going to get it up there.'

The U12, which was destroyed by the 
Royal Navy 25 miles off the coast of Eyemouth, Berwickshire, in 1915, is
one of at least four submarine-wrecks which regularly attract diving 
expeditions.

But the wrecks
are in such deep water it can take divers on a 60-minute trip up to 
half an hour to come to the surface to avoid the bends.

Gary Fairbairn, the coxswain of Dunbar lifeboat, said: 'We were responding to a mayday from the Eyemouth dive boat Jacob George.

''One of a party of seven divers exploring the wreck of a German U Boat had lost his air supply on the seabed.

'His dive buddy sent him up to the surface but he was unconscious.

'We were about an hour away and as we were about three miles from the casualty a rescue helicopter from RAF Boulmer arrived on scene and winched the diver a board and rushed him to Ninewellls Hospital in Dundee but very sadly he was dead.'

The Dunbar lifeboat took the Mr Woolston’s dive buddy back to Eyemouth suffering from shock where he was examined by medics.

A rescue insider said: 'He was at a depth of about 47m (154ft). The diver was still attached to the shot line [safety rope] and floated up while still attached to it.'

The casualty was taken to Ninewells 
Hospital, Dundee, which has a hyperbaric chamber - a facility which can 
save the lives of bends victims by artificially creating pressure and 
then slowly reducing it.

The trip was organised by Eyemouth-based diving company Marine Quest.

They confirmed the dead diver was on their trip but declined to comment further.

Jim MacLeod, part of the 2008 research team which discovered U12, said the trip should not have posed any unusual dangers.

Mr MacLeod, who dived on the wreck 
himself, said: 'It’s not a hazardous dive. It’s at a depth of 48m and is
on an open sand bed - there’s nothing overly dangerous down there.'

He suggested the bends - the forming of nitrogen bubbles in the blood caused by pressure - may have caused the man’s death.

'If you’re diving for an hour, 
depending on equipment and oxygen levels, you can complete it in 20 
minutes, leaving you with half an hour to return to the surface.

'But
if you’re down for only five minutes then you can get away with coming 
up quicker - it all depends on how long you’re diving for, your depth 
and the oxygen you have with you.

'It’s a shame this diver died as result of his trip.

A trawler spotted U12 early on the morning of the 10th March 1915 east of Fife Ness.

Three British warships, the Acheron, the Attack and the Ariel, were sent to track it down and engage it.

The Ariel spotted the periscope of the vessel submerged just under the surface - ramming it at full speed.

The rusted remains of the U12 and her crew remained undiscovered for 93 years.

For many years numerous locations for the wreck had been reported.

All proved fruitless. Finally, after a five year search, the U12 was rediscovered off the coast of Scotland 25 miles east of Eyemouth following a detailed study of contemporary records of the battle.

In January 2008 a dive was organised to explore the location which was discovered.

'Marine Quest are a popular company and those in charge really know their stuff.'

The U12 - a 60m-long submarine - was 
attacked and sunk by three Royal Navy destroyers on 10 March 1915 as it 
targeted cargo ships on the east coast. Ten crew survived.

At least three other wrecked German submarines lie on the seabed off the east coast of Scotland.

Around
100 submariners perished aboard U714, U40 and UC41, which were 
targeting supply ships making their way out the Firth of Forth.

Lothian and Borders Police have launched an investigation into the man’s death.

A
police spokesman said: 'Lothian and Borders Police are investigating 
the sudden death of a man in his fifties after he took ill during a 
diving trip, which set off from Eyemouth, Scottish Borders.

'The man was taken to Ninewells Hospital after members of his group raised the alarm around 2.30pm on Sunday 19th August.

'However,
despite the best efforts of medical staff, he later passed away.

Enquiries are ongoing into the full circumstances surrounding this 
death.'
