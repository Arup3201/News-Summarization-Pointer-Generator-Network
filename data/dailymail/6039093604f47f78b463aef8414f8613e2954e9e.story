The family of critically injured Phil Hughes were today at his bedside as the Australian cricketer fought for life after he was struck on the head by a cricket ball in an horrific accident at Sydney Cricket Ground.

His family were joined by close friend Michael Clarke, who returned to St Vincent's Hospital at 7am this morning to be by Hughes' side. The Australian captain had left just hours before after spending seven hours in hospital supporting Hughes in the intensive care unit.

Some of Hughes' team-mates also arrived at the hospital this morning, including Australian wicket keeper Brad Haddin. The New South Wales doctor John Orchard - who treated Hughes at the side of the pitch yesterday - went into the hospital about 8am.

The 25-year-old has been in an induced coma since he collapsed face first on the pitch on Tuesday when he was hit by a bouncer bowled by New South Wales' Sean Abbott during day one of the Sheffield Shield.

He was rushed to St Vincent's Hospital - in Sydney's inner city suburb of Darlinghurst - for emergency surgery to reduce the swelling on his brain.

It will be a tense wait for the South Australian batsman's family, who are from Macksville on the north coast of NSW. 

They released a statement late on Tuesday that said: 'The outcome of that surgery is unlikely to be known for the next 24 to 48 hours.'

Horrified onlookers at the match watched as paramedics performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on the batsman and treated him on the boundary for about 40 minutes. Hughes' mother and sister were in the stands at the time of the incident.

The injured batsman was taken from the field on a medical transport vehicle.

He arrived at St Vincent's Hospital in an ambulance on life support before he underwent scans and was carted into the operating theatre, hospital spokesman David Faktor told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Faktor said the operation - similar to those performed on king-hit victims when they fall onto the pavement - took less than an hour. 

'He's in the best of hands, he has loved ones here,' the spokesman said.

Supportive messages are pouring in from the cricket community with Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland leading the charge.

Mr Sutherland described how the cricket world was rallying behind the quiet achiever. 'He's a really popular guy, not just from Australia but from around the world,' Mr Sutherland said. 

'His welfare is our highest priority.'

He was joined by a chorus of cricket legends including Kerry O'Keefe who told Radio 2GB: 'This is a bloke everybody likes. [Everybody] will be feeling the impact of this blow.'

Former Australian cricketer Brett Lee told Channel Nine  the event was 'shocking', calling Hughes a ‘terrific guy from a beautiful family’ who has ‘his whole future ahead of him’.

'You just don’t think these things will happen in cricket,' Mr Lee said.

'You have guys that can bowl 150 kilometres per hour - the helmet isn't really a lot of protection.'

Hughes' good friend David Warner issued this statement: 'He is a fighter and a champion and he will get through this'

National coach Darren Lehmann described Hughes as a 'great fighter and a great young man'

There has been a wave of support for Phil Hughes, with his family saying it may be 24 to 48 hours before we learn if his surgery was successful

More words of support from cricketer Dean Jones who also told Sean Abbott to 'stay strong'

Craig McDermott shared his message on Twitter, saying his thoughts were with Hughes' family

Hughes' friend David Warner, who rode the medical transport vehicle with the injured cricketer off the pitch on Tuesday, described his friend as 'champion and a fighter'. 

'He will get through this,' Warner wrote. 

Former Australian spin bowler Shane Warne tweeted a message of support to Hughes and his family.

'Just heard the news about Phil Hughes, thoughts and prayers are with you and your family. Hang in there buddy, we are all fighting with u !!!' he wrote.

Australian national coach Darren Lehmann tweeted: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with phil and his family! He is a great fighter and a great young man!'

Test cricketer Peter Siddle was one of many others who sent messages of support, writing: 'Sad to hear about my little mate Hughsey. Thoughts go out to him and his family. Stay strong brother! X'

While her husband was at hospital, Michael Clarke's partner Kyly - set to appear on television show Dancing With The Stars on Thursday night - urged her considerable number of followers on Instagram to say a prayer for Hughes.

'It will be hard to smile tonight for @dancingau as my thoughts, my hearts and prayers are with my little brother Phillip Hughes and his family. Pls pls all say a prayer for him,' she said.

Commentator Dean Jones said: 'Feeling for Phil Hughes after being hit. He is not in a good way! Stay strong. Not your fault young man.'

Cricketer Chris Lynn added: 'Thoughts are with little Huey. Absolute champion of a bloke! Fingers crossed your ok brother'. 

Many, including former Australian cricketer Nathan Bracken and coach Craig McDermott, said they were sending their thoughts to bowler Sean Abbott as well.

Before the incident, Hughes had scored a composed 63 off 161 balls and looked to be in good form to claim Michael Clarke's vacant Test batting spot in next week's first Test against India.

Hughes has played 26 Test matches for Australia and has scored three Test centuries. His injury prompted officials to call an early tea break with SA at 2-136 but play was then abandoned for the day.  

'Clearly the priority is Phil's health and we want to keep his family fully informed,' a Cricket NSW spokesman said. 

Hughes was accompanied to hospital by NSW team doctor John Orchard. 

Cricket writer Peter Lalor tweeted earlier Hughes' may have left the grounds in a better state.

'Phil's condition improved before he was taken away in an ambulance,' he wrote. 

South Australian Cricket Association chief executive Keith Bradshaw said: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Phil and his family and friends.

'We are obviously very, very shocked with what's occurred and very upset.'

Nine News reporter Will Dempsey was watching the match at the grounds when Phil Hughes was struck by the ball.

'I have still goosebumps. It was chilling,' Dempsey told Daily Mail Australia

'There was this crack that echoed through the grounds. It was an eerie feeling, you knew something wasn't right.

'It didn't sound like leather hitting hard metal, it looked like a bouncer crept under his grill.

'Players ran to him as soon as he collapsed face first.

'Brad Haddin rolled Hughes onto his side and doctors were immediately at the grounds.

'Tom Cooper and David Warner stayed by his side for more than half an hour.

They worked on Phil for around 45 minutes.

'There was dead silence at the grounds. No one in the stands spoke or move. No one left, unless they were moving closer to Hughes to help.

'Steve O'Keefe came off the ground crying. Hughes was loaded into one of two ambulances. It appeared that the helicopter landed at Paddington Barracks.

'Steve Smith came to the stands, visibly distressed.

'Speaking with Moises Henriques and Mark Waugh, Steve motioned to indicate that Phil had been hit underneath his jawline..

'Sean Abbott, who had bowled to Hughes, was in the dressing room the entire time. Players were comforting each other, many were crying.'

'It was the second ball to hit a player in five overs. It was fast bowling but Abbott's ball to Hughes was a bit sharper than usual.

'The ambulance changed direction to avoid the crowds. People and guards were yelling at people who were trying to take photos of Phil as they loaded him into the ambulance.

'Umpires were shouting 'get away, get away'

'David Warner had been at Phil's side and walked up to his fiancé and daughter in the stands for a warm hug - he was really upset.'
