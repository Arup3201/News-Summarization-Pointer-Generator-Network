The business partner of a New York real estate developer whose body was found smoldering in a dumpster last week is now said to be fearing for his life.

Security guards have been seen outside the home of Israel 'Sam' Perlmutter, 42, which is just blocks away from that of murdered Menachem 'Max' Stark, 42.

Some have theorised that Stark was killed because of debts in the housing business, which he shared with Perlmutter, after defaulting on a $29million loan in 2008.

Tradition: The funeral took place in Williamsburg just hours after Stark's badly burned body was found in a Dumpster on Long Island

According to the New York Post, Perlmutter now fears that whoever murdered Stark is coming for him and has 'loaded up with security guards' since the killing.

According to the paper, 'any number of people' wanted Stark dead including nearly all of his dozens of 
business associates and hundreds of tenants.

Stark was branded a slumlord and a loan shark, and was accused of running substandard housing blocks, one of which was declared 'hazardous to life'.

However family members have now hit back, saying that the rumours have been created by a few people envious of Stark's success.

According to the New York Daily News, Stark's brother said: 'He was a good man, and he helped everyone.

'You know how people are. They’re looking for gossip. . . . People are jealous because he was successful.'

Moses Strulowitz, 31, a brother-in-law added: 'This is the devil’s work. If you were chosen for this despicable act, God will punish you sooner or later.'

Meanwhile a family friend suggested that Stark knew he was being watched and confided in his wife days before his death that he was feeling nervous.

Hundreds of members of a Hasidic 
community gathered Saturday in Brooklyn, New York, for an emotional 
funeral service honoring Stark, a father of eight.

Somber
 mourners dressed all in black came together at the Lodiner Bais 
Medrash synagogue in Williamsburg to pay tribute to Stark, whose charred
 remains were discovered in a Dumpster on Long Island Friday afternoon.

Detectives investigating the case are finding a that Stark left a trail of unpaid contractors, ripped-off tenants and tens of millions in debts related to the 17 properties he owned in the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods of Brooklyn, according to the Post.

His tenants were also furious. His 17 buildings had received 233 complaints and 148  violations - 49 of which were still open.

Many tenants told the Post his properties were infested with rodents, sometimes didn't have heat or water and had shabby interiors.

'I’ve had many conversations with him, and of course in many of those conversations I wanted to kill him myself,' Greg Hanlon, who lived in one of Stark's Greenpoint buildings, joked to the Post.

In 2009, according to the newspaper, one of Stark's buildings was so rundown, the city ordered all tenants to vacate and deemed it no acceptable to live in.

Kind words: Speakers talked about Stark's well-known generosity and readiness to help those less fortunate

Ritual: Eulogies offered at the Lodiner Bais Medrash synagogue were frequently interrupted by wailing from the overflowing crowd

Tenants were forced to track Stark down in order to get back the four-months deposit they had put down.

'He pretty much ripped off the whole building,' a tenant organizer, Ryan Kuonen, said.

'They kept trying to serve him, and he kept hiding from them. When he’d hear "Are you Max Stark," he would take off running.'

Said one detective working the case: 'He f***ed a lot of people over.'

Some neighbors told police that he was also a neighborhood 'loan shark,' according to the Post. He lent thousands to friends and then demanded it back with interest.

'He's a scammer,' a source told the Post.

In accordance with Jewish tradition, Stark's funeral service and burial took place just hours after police 
identified the scorched body found at a Great Neck, New York, gas station as the missing real 
estate developer who was forced into a van during Thursday's blizzard.  

During the ceremony, which was conducted in Yiddish and was frequently interrupted by ritual wailing, speakers described the father of eight as a pillar of the Satmar Hasidic community who was always ready to help the less fortunate with money for food and rent, The Jewish Daily Forward reported. 

A body was found at around 4pm Friday in Great Neck with extensive burns and Nassau County police have identified the remains as that of Stark, 39, who was kidnapped in Brooklyn during the blizzard that hit New York City.

A police source told the New York Daily News that the victim was likely suffocated before his killers wrapped his body in fabric, stuffed him into a trash bin at a gas station and set fire to his corpse.

Fernando Cerff, the owner of the Getty gas station on Cutter Mill Road, told the paper that Friday morning his workers were shoveling snow when they noticed smoke rising from the Dumpster.

Thinking that someone had tossed a cigarette inside, they sprinkled some snow into the container. When Cerff approached the Dumpster in the afternoon, he noticed a horrible stench coming from the bin.

Cerff became suspicious and called police, which immediately discovered the body amidst the trash beneath a layer of snow.

This development comes as cops released dramatic surveillance footage that shows the suspects forcing Stark into a Dodge Caravan after he left his offices in Williamsburg late on Thursday evening.

On Friday the family of Stark, 39, offered a $100,000 'no questions asked' reward for his safe return on Friday, as police combed through surveillance video that appears to show his abduction.

Officers say the incident happened at around 11.20pm, when Stark was grabbed by two men on Rutledge Street in South Williamsburg. Some reports suggest he was carrying $4,000 in cash.

DNA Info
 reported that Stark was approached and manhandled into a light-colored 
van by two men as he left his office at Southside Associates at 331 
Rutledge Street.

His wife, 
Bashie, apparently became concerned when Stark did not return after 
midnight and contacted Shomrim, a neighborhood patrol group for the 
Orthodox community. 

Surveillance
 footage was then discovered in Stark's office that shows a struggle 
with one man, before the van pulls up and he is wrestled by two men into
 the vehicle.

Stark's brothers Yitzy and Yoely told the New York Post: 'We saw two people fighting with him, and they put him into a big white van, a Dodge Caravan,' Yitzy, 30, said.

The brothers described Menachem's alleged attackers to the Post as 'big' and 'black.'

The New York Daily News
 reported that Stark was carrying $4,000 in cash, but Yitzy Stark denied
 this when he offered the six-figure reward for his brother's return.

'We're
 waiting for a phone call with demands. [We're] just hoping that he is 
still alive,' Yitzy told DNA Info. 'We'll do anything they ask.'

Shomrim
 reportedly informed the NYPD of the incident at around 2.30 a.m. on 
Friday. Both the police and the community are now looking for clues on 
the white Dodge minivan.

Officials spent the day in the local area conducting interviews and reviewing surveillance footage from local businesses.

The Real Deal
 claimed that Stark, and associate Israel Perlmutter, were being sued 
more than $51 million in 2011, over loans for development projects in 
Williamsburg and Greenpoint.

And a number of tenants who claimed to
 live in properties owned by Southside Associates have left a number of 
angry complaints on sites such as Yelp about the condition and maintenance of the apartments, also describing Stark as a 'slumlord.'

One
 user wrote: 'These people are absolutely terrible. It's as though they 
have no hearts and no compassion for anyone else. All they seem to care 
about is their bank account.'

Yitzy
 Stark described his brother to the Daily News as 'a good man, a great 
man.' 'Nobody around here would say anything bad about him,' he added.
