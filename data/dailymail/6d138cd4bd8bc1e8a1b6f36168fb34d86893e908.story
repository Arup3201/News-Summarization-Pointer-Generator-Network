It was the most shameful hour in the history of German football.

Ten minutes into their final group game of the 1982 World Cup in Spain, Horst Hrubesch put West Germany 1-0 up against neighbours Austria.

It was a scoreline that would send both teams through to the following round. From that moment on, the two sides honoured an implicit non-aggression pact. Neither side made any significant attempt to score.

For over an hour, the whole stadium in Gijon provided a soundtrack of whistles and boos. Both German and Austrian television commentators apologised to viewers on behalf of their teams. But it didn’t help.

The game finished 1-0. Algeria, the unfortunate victims of the disgrace, were knocked out, left only to fume at the terrible injustice.

Thirty two years on, and Germany is beginning to worry that the ‘Scandal of Gijon’ might happen again.

In the zone: The current Germany World Cup squad are focused on avoided a repeat of the 1982 fiasco

Thursday sees the current German side play their final group game of the 2014 tournament. They face the USA. A draw would see both teams progress, with Germany topping the group.

The fear of a repeat of Gijon is not as irrational as it might seem. Germany and the USA are practically cousins in footballing terms.

In Jermaine Jones, Fabian Johnson, John Anthony Brooks, Julian Green and Timothy Chandler, the US have five squad members who played in the Bundesliga last season.

All five of them were born in Germany, and three of them - Johnson, Brooks and Green – played for German national youth teams, before deciding to switch allegiances to the US.

Johnson even won a major trophy with the Germany U21s. In 2009, he conquered Europe alongside Mesut Ozil, Sami Khedira and Manuel Neuer, all of whom he will meet again on Thursday. 

And who could forget the coach? Jürgen Klinsmann is not just a German, he is the man who, between 2004 and 2006, revolutionised the German national team. He laid the foundations for the exciting, youthful Germany set up we see today. After the 2006 World Cup he handed the reins to his right hand man: Joachim Low.

Klinsmann and Low belong together. They are Jogi and Klinsi: the stylish revolutionaries, who still stay in touch, sharing tips and keeping each other on their toes. 

As far as their next encounter goes, however, all parties insist that there will be no Gijon-style pact between the two teams. Klinsmann has said that he and Löw have not contacted each other.

‘This is no time to be calling your friends. It’s down to business. We will do everything to beat Germany,’ said the US coach.

In the German camp, the party line is much the same. Low’s assistant Hansi Flick reminded reporters that the US had been seconds away from qualification against Portugal, before the Iberians clinched a late equaliser. ‘For that reason, we will do everything to avoid a draw. We want to win.’

Defender Mats Hummels was quick to back his bosses up. ‘It would be horribly unsporting if we were to play for the draw. That’s not how we play.

‘That’s not to say I’m going to be taking on four players on my own in the 91st minute, though,’ Hummels added, ‘though I might take on one or two’.

Heartbreak: USA were seconds away from qualifying to the last-16 of the World Cup before Portugal equalised

The German press have certainly made it clear to their team that they will not accept another sporting disgrace against the USA, with Gijon dominating headlines in the build up to Thursday’s game. 

The ‘Tagesspiegel’ ran with the ominous headline ‘Scandal on the mind’, while ‘Handelsblatt’ simply pleaded ‘Anything but another Gijon’. 

If the German side needed any other reminder not to repeat the antics of their predecessors, the luck of the draw has also given them a serendipitous heads up. Should Germany win the group as expected, they are likely to play Algeria in the second round. No matter what happens against the USA, the North Africans would surely enjoy a chance to avenge the insult of 1982.
