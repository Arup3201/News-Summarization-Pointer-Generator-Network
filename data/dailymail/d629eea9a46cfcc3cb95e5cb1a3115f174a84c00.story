Women carrying devastating inherited conditions yesterday backed the Government’s approval of DNA treatment to create babies with three genetic parents – a technique that could let them have healthy children.

Ministers say they will publish draft regulations for Britain to become the first country legalising the controversial IVF procedure, although it will be up to MPs to vote them in.

The move has sparked an ethical debate, with desperate women who could benefit calling for an urgent change in the law.

Sharon's son Edward Bernardi died last week at the age of 21, after battling the rare hereditary condition Leigh's Disease since the age of four (pictured aged one with his mother)

However, some groups fear the technology could lead to designer babies.

But Sharon Bernardi, who has lost seven children, said: ‘We are not changing the colour of eyes and we are not choosing to have boys and girls, we just want a baby to be healthy and survive, that’s all.’

Rachel Kean, who risks giving any future children Melas disease, which affects the brain, nervous system and muscles, said: ‘To have the option of knowing that your child could live a life free of these devastating diseases and live without this cruel life is something incredible.’

The technique involves replacing defective DNA in the mother’s egg with material from a donor egg.

The resulting healthy child would therefore have genetic material from three parents – two mothers and a father. For the first time the so-called ‘germ line’ of inherited DNA from the mother would be altered which, critics say, would mark a turning point in the ethics of reproductive technology.

Professor Dame Sally Davies, the Government’s chief medical officer, said the ban on tinkering with the fundamental DNA that determines an person’s make-up, such as facial features and eye colour, will not change.

But taking a snippet of DNA during the proposed process was more like replacing a defective ‘battery pack’ in human cells, she said.

Rachel Kean said that the option to know your children could survive would be priceless

It would affect a tiny amount of DNA in mitochondria – the tiny powerhouses inside cells that turn food into energy – which is only passed down by the mother. Mothers with certain defective DNA can pass on mitochondrial diseases. If MPs approve the regulations, the first patients could be assessed and approved for treatment in 2015.

It is expected that up to ten healthy babies with three parents each could be born every year to couples who might otherwise face the heartbreak of seeing them severely disabled and dying young.

Sir John Tooke, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, said: ‘The Academy is delighted that the Department of Health is taking steps to ensure techniques which could reduce the number of children born with rare mitochondrial diseases can move closer to being used in the clinic.’ 

Sharmila Nebhrajani, chief of the Association of Medical Research Charities, said: ‘Mitochondrial diseases are some of the most debilitating inherited conditions, for which there are few therapies and no cures.

‘Acknowledging the need for treatments to be proven safe and effective and for the public to feel comfortable with the implications is important, but that caution must not prevent us taking bold steps in the adoption of such potentially life-saving advances.’ 

But Helen Watt, of the Anscombe Bioethics Centre in Oxford, said the procedure would deliberately create an embryo for ‘spare parts’, adding: ‘Parenthood is about unconditional welcome of children, not manufacture and control. Couples who do not want to take the risk of passing on mitochondrial disease might want to consider ethical alternatives like adoption.’ 

Dr David King, director of Human Genetics Alert, said: ‘It is a disaster that the decision to cross the line that will eventually lead to a eugenic designer baby market should be taken on the basis of a biased and inadequate consultation.’

The experience of losing seven children left Sharon Bernardi devastated.

Six died within four days of being born after suffering from diseases caused by defects in her mitochondrial DNA.

Mrs Bernardi, 46, from Sunderland, and her husband Neil believe the new preventative technology is ‘the best way forward’.

She believes it ‘would have made a huge difference’ to her life and helped with her desperate hope for a healthy child. 

She said: ‘It’s quite hard to keep going and trying, but I had to.’ 

When her son Edward survived his first week, she dared to hope things would be better. But at four and half he was diagnosed with Leigh’s disease, a result of mutations within mitochondrial DNA that affect the brain and nervous system.

Edward confounded doctors’ predictions that he would live only a few months and reached his 21st birthday before dying.

Mrs Bernardi said: ‘Edward was my life. You live with that pain every day.’ 

For Rachel Kean, the risk of passing on defective DNA and the possibility of having severely disabled children is a real fear.

Miss Kean, 24, is having tests to see if she has Melas disease, caused defective mitochondrial DNA. Her mother is a carrier and it led to the death of her maternal aunt.

Miss Kean, from London, said: ‘This is not about eugenics. We are talking about preventing life-threatening diseases.’
