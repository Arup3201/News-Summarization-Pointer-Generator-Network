Elected police commissioners are showing a 'worrying' ability to evade rules when sacking chief constables, MPs have warned.

Protections in place that allow police chiefs to fight their corner if they are being forced out appear to be being side-stepped, according to the Home Affairs committee.

It says the early indications are that it is 'very easy' for a police and crime commissioner (PCC) to remove a chief constable for reasons of an 'insubstantial nature' and even the Home Secretary is powerless to intervene.

Singled out: Gwent commissioner Ian Johnston was criticised for 'persuading' Chief Constable Carmel Napier to retire, bypassing the formal process

MPs warned it was further evidence that the checks and balances on PCCs are 'too weak'.

They were particularly critical of Gwent commissioner Ian Johnston who 'persuaded' Chief Constable Carmel Napier to retire earlier this year, which meant the formal process was bypassed.

The committee said the reasons given for the decision were 'unsubstantiated by any concrete examples'. It also rounded on him for criticising the grilling he received about the move at the hands of Labour MP Chris Ruane, who represents the Vale of Clwyd in North Wales.

'We were disappointed that, shortly after we took evidence from Mr Johnston, he took to Twitter to criticise a member of the committee for asking questions that he believed had been prompted by Gwent MPs, describing the proceedings as 'sad really',' the report said.

Mr Johnson even described Mr Ruane as a 'plant of Gwent MPs'.

This disdainful attitude towards scrutiny by Parliament, as well as an indication of a clear over-sensitivity to criticism, from a politician elected by less that 8% of the electorate, who had managed to side-step the statutory arrangements for local scrutiny of his decision to sack the chief constable, is further evidence, if any were needed, that the checks and balances on police and crime commissioners are too weak.

PCCs, which replaced existing police authorities in 41 force areas across England and Wales, were handed the power to set force budgets and hire and fire chief constables.

Just 15.1% of registered voters took part in the November 2012 PCC election - the lowest recorded level of participation at a peacetime non-local government election in Britain.

Concern: Keith Vaz said it was 'worrying' that PCC seem able to side-step statutory process

MPs said it should 'not have come as any surprise' that there were a number of high-profile clashes between commissioners and chief constables following the reforms.

Lincolnshire chief constable Neil Rhodes was suspended by PCC Alan Hardwick but was reinstated following a High Court judgment that described the decision 'irrational and perverse'.

Commissioners remove chief constables by 'calling upon' them to resign or retire but they must first give a written explanation of the reasons for the proposal and then consider any response.

Police and crime panels must make a recommendation to the commissioner within six weeks backing or opposing the plan and may consult HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary.

Neither of the two chief constables removed had ended up going through the process, the committee said.

Keith Vaz said: 'It is worrying that Police and Crime Commissioners seem able to side-step the statutory process for dismissing a chief constable. Police and Crime Panels should make more active use of their powers to scrutinise decisions such as this.'

'We will be returning to this area when we carry out our next major inquiry into Police and Crime Commissioners, towards the end of this year.'
