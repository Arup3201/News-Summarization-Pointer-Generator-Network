Arrest: Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg, 45, was one of four people held in Syria-related terrorism raids across Birmingham today

A Guantanamo Bay inmate given £1million compensation by Britain for alleged complicity in his torture was arrested yesterday on suspicion of waging jihad in Syria.

Moazzam Begg was questioned about claims he attended a terror training camp and facilitated terrorism overseas.

In 2010, the Government paid him ‘hush money’ to silence his claim that UK spies were complicit in his torture at Guantanamo. He was held in the notorious US prison camp for nearly three years as a suspected Al Qaeda terrorist.

Yesterday the 45-year-old was arrested by police in the Hall Green area of Birmingham in a dawn raid on the £395,000 house he bought for cash with his compensation money.

There has been increasing concern from police and MI5 about an estimated 400 young British Muslims who have travelled to Syria to wage holy war with Al Qaeda-linked groups.

Earlier this month, a British suicide bomber blew up his lorry at a prison in Syria, one of an estimated 20 Britons to have been killed fighting in the wartorn state. Police fear others will return to the UK battle-hardened.

Begg has made no secret of travelling to Syria in 2012, and has even claimed his visit there was sanctioned by MI5.

Two weeks ago, he wrote a blog explaining that his two trips were humanitarian missions in which he visited wounded civilians and gathered evidence from torture victims.

He claimed he has been ‘continually harassed’ by police and MI5 because of his campaign to expose the British Government’s complicity in torture.

West Midlands Police arrested another man, aged 36, from Shirley, Solihull, and a mother, 44, and her 20-year-old son from Sparkhill, Birmingham, on suspicion of facilitating terrorism overseas.

Detective Superintendent Shaun Edwards, head of investigations for the regional counter-terrorism unit, said: ‘All four arrests are connected. They were pre-planned and intelligence-led. There was no immediate risk to public safety.

‘We continue to urge anyone planning to travel to Syria to read the advice issued by the Foreign Office.’

The Mail can reveal Begg was recently stopped by Kent Police at Dover as he accompanied a Syria aid convoy.

Several
 such convoys have been stopped and at least one, in December 2012, was 
found to contain £36,000 and $10,000 in cash. Police are still 
investigating what the money was for.

Last
 October, Charity Commission chairman William Shawcross warned it was 
almost inevitable that some charity money would end up in the hands  of 
terrorists.

In Germany, it 
has been claimed that Syria relief convoys have picked up weapons after 
travelling beyond the jurisdiction of European intelligence agencies.

Yesterday,
 Birmingham-born Begg and the other suspects were questioned at a police
 station in the West Midlands, and their three home addresses were being
 searched.

Police took away 
two cars belonging to Begg and his wife Sally, 42, who live at the 
four-bedroom detached house with three of their four children.

A
 West Midlands Police spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that Moazzam Begg 
was arrested this morning’, but added that naming Begg did ‘not imply 
any guilt’.

Begg’s younger brother, who did not want to be named, said yesterday: ‘We don’t think he’s done anything wrong.’

Arrested: Moazzam Begg, seen at an Amnesty International press conference in 2010, was arrested by West Midlands Police officers today

Musarat
 Siksek, 41, who is married to Sally’s brother Samur, said: ‘Moazzam has
 been arrested before, quite a few times, so it hasn’t really shocked 
me.’

In December last year,
 the Home Office stripped Begg of his UK passport because he had visited
 Syria and had been assessed as being involved in terrorist activity, he
 said.

Begg has said he was 
being harassed because of his work with CagePrisoners, a charity that 
campaigns for the rights of individuals detained during 
counter-terrorism operations.

He
 was detained in Pakistan in 2002, branded an ‘enemy combatant’ and 
taken to an internment centre before being transferred to Guantanamo.

When he was freed in 2005, the CIA was still privately calling him an Al Qaeda terrorist.

Probe: Police were seen entering and leaving Moazzam Begg's property in Birmingham throughout the day

Arrests: West Midlands Police said they arrested 45-year-old Moazzam Begg in Hall green, Birmingham. A 36-year-old man from Shirley was arrested, plus a woman aged 44 and her son aged 20 from Sparkhill were also held.

Plea: Moazzam Begg, who is now a human rights campaigner, is seen on the BBC appealing for the release of Norman Kember, a British man who was held hostage in Iraq. Mr Kember was rescued by British Special Forces in 2006
