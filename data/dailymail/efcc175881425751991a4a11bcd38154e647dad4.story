A law student left paralysed by a rare spinal condition has defied doctors' predictions and landed a dream career as a model.

Katie Knowles, 24, feared she'd never walk again after developing disc degenerative disease and spinal stenosis – a condition that usually only affects pensioners - at just 15 years old.

She lost feeling in her toes, feet, and thighs and couldn't even get out of bed without help – a devastating situation for a girl who had previously been a ballet dancer, swimmer, badminton player and horse rider.

After years of back pain, Miss Knowles was diagnosed with spinal stenosis due to a slipped disc in her back at just 15 years old. At 20 years old she underwent a nine hour operation  to remove the slipped disc in her back. But when she woke up she had lost all mobility in the lower half of her body

Despite doctors warning her paralysis meant she faced life in a wheelchair, she underwent physiotherapy and fought hard to learn to walk all over again.

And though at one point she 'thought her life was over', she has now launched a career as a model, and wants to inspire other people with mobility issues to follow their dreams.

Miss Knowles, from Newcastle, said: 'When I realised I couldn't walk I felt like my life was over - I couldn't feel my feet and parts of my legs, it was horrendous - it was like I was paralysed.

'I was so used to being active, I danced regularly, played Badminton for the county, and swam competitively, but suddenly I couldn't do anything at all.

'Learning to walk again was so difficult and frustrating - I got the nickname Bambi at physio because I was so wobbly.

'I was very determined, and taking my first steps was just amazing, but the experience left me with no confidence at all.

'A friend suggested that I should try some modelling, as she had already done it, so I agreed to take some pictures with her for fun.

Spinal stenosis is the narrowing of the spinal canal.

It can be caused by problems, including overgrowth of bone or other tissue or by a herniated disc.

Sometimes called a slipped disc or a ruptured disc, a herniated disc occurs when some of the softer 'jelly' pushes out through a crack in the tougher exterior.

When the spinal canal which surrounds the spinal cord gets too narrow, it can squeeze and choke the spinal cord or nearby nerve roots.

Spinal stenosis can cause pain, numbness, or weakness in the legs, buttocks, arms, or neck, depending on which area of the spine is affected.

This is known medically as 'sciatica'. 

'Before I knew it she'd put them online, and I had photographers and brands contacting me to work with them - it was unbelievable.'

Despite her condition, Miss Knowles is determined to carve out a successful career for herself.

She said: 'I still use my crutches all the time, and on a really bad day I'll use a wheelchair, but I won't let that stop me.

'I'll try anything at shoots because I want to prove to the photographer that I'm a good model.

'I once modelled on a horse, and it threw me off backwards - everyone else was concerned about my back but I was more worried about my hair and make up.

'I did a bridal shoot once, and one of the photographer's helpers had to hide under my dress holding me steady because I was quite unstable on my feet.

'But if there's a pose or a shot that the photographer wants, I'll do everything to make sure I can achieve it.'

After years of living with pain, Miss Knowles was diagnosed with disc degenerative disease, where one of the discs in the spinal cord becomes worn away (sometimes referred to as a 'slipped disc'), causing pain in the back.

She was also diagnosed with spinal stenosis – in which the spinal canal become narrowed, squeezing and choking the spinal cord or nearby nerve roots - causing pain, tingling and weakness in the back and legs (known as sciatica), at just 15 years old.

The disease stunned doctors, who had never seen a case in someone so young before.

Miss Knowles said: 'When doctors first suspected I had the condition, they couldn't quite believe it because it's something that only happens to old people.

'They wondered if I'd some kind of trauma, but no one can work out why I have it - it's just one of those things.

Though doctors said she faced a life in a wheelchair, Miss Knowles was determined to walk again. As her confidence had been shattered by the ordeal, a friend recommended she tried modelling. She discovered she loved being behind the camera and was approached by other photographers

Doctors were stunned when Miss Knowles was diagnosed with spinal stenosis at just 15 years old, as this condition is normally only seen in pensioners. She lost confidence after being left paralysed, but modelling gave her a new sense of purpose. She is pictured (left and right) posing in her own photographs

'It's funny because now my Nana, who is 82, has been diagnosed with the same thing.'

At 16 years old she underwent surgery to remove the part of the slipped disc that was pressing on her nerve, in the hope that it would reduce her back pain.

However, four years later the pain returned and so doctors decided to carry out a more extreme operation to remove the  disc entirely.

It was after this operation Miss Knowles woke up unable to feel  or move anything in her lower body.

Ms Knowles said: 'They took a bone graft from my hip and put it where the disc was, then they put rods either side of the new disc and screwed it all in place.

'It took nine hours and was supposed to be the cure I needed, but I woke up in agony and completely unable to walk.'

The once active student woke up to a completely new life - and was horrified to discover that she had lost her mobility.

After six months of physiotherapy, and feeling as though her life had been shattered by her paralysis, Miss Knowles is proud to have learned to walk again.After six months of physiotherapy, and feeling as though her life had been shattered by her paralysis, Miss Knowles is proud to have learned to walk again.

'I was so young when I got this condition that there were no other people my age to talk to about it, I thought it was the end of the world,' Miss Knowles said. However, modelling gave her a new sense of purpose

This was a known risk of the surgery - but was unexpected in Miss Knowles' case. 

Feeling as though her life as she knew it had been shattered, her journey to being able to walk again was difficult. 

She said: 'I was out of hospital, but I still had a long way to go, plus my confidence was at an all time low.

'I'd put on a lot of weight in hospital, and I just felt like a different person.

'I couldn't dance or do any sports, and I'd lost my independence because I was so unsteady.'

But after being introduced to modelling by a friend, she discovered a new sense of purpose.

Miss Knowles said: 'My friend, who also has mobility issues, suggested I try modelling, as it had boosted her confidence too.

'I had nothing to lose so I thought I may as well give it a go.

'As soon as I got in front of the camera I loved it, and the response was amazing.

Before being diagnosed at 16 years old, Miss Knowles was a keen ballet dancer (left), badminton player (pictured right with a medal) and horse rider. But she was blighted by agonising back pain

Now, Miss Knowles is trying to raise as much awareness of her condition as possible. 'Disabled people receive so little representation in the media, so Models of Diversity is trying to change that. I want to show people that you don't have to let it hold you back - you can still achieve your dreams,' she said

'I'm now the face of some independent clothing labels, and I regularly pose for photographers.

'I'm also a model for Models of Diversity - a company that campaign for more diversity within the modelling industry.

'Disabled people receive so little representation in the media, so Models of Diversity is trying to change that.

'I'm really excited to be part of such an important campaign.'
