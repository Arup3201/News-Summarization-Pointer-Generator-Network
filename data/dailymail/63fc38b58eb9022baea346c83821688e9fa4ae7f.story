Anti-virus software tycoon John McAfee took a romantic stroll with a mystery woman in Miami over the weekend.

Wearing a pinky ring and chatting on the phone, McAfee seemed relaxed, despite the fact he remains wanted for questioning over a death in Belize and faces a $5million lawsuit in Arizona.

The 67-year-old claimed last week that he has no money or a home in the U.S. and that he was going to stay in Florida until his 20-year-old Belizean girlfriend could join him.

But on Saturday McAfee walked arm in arm with an unknown companion near his boutique hotel in South Beach, Miami. He attended to some business on his cell phone before sitting down to a romantic meal with the woman.

The software mogul usually updates his personal blog with pithy comments and tales of his international escapades on a regular basis.

Yet on Monday morning, McAfee blogged that he was planning to step out of the media spotlight, citing the school shooting in Connecticut.

'Hello readers, I apologize for my recent absence and lack of updates,' he wrote. 'Due to the terrible events at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton (sic) Conn, I have decided to take a few days absence from public life. I will resume with my blog activities in a few days.

'Do your best to forget the name of the 
shooter, and remember the innocent victims of this terrible act,' he added before listing the names of those who died in the tragedy last week.

McAfee still faces a $5 million lawsuit over the death of a businessman in Arizona.

A potentially expensive court case over the death of Robert Gilson, 61, was a major factor for the renegade setting up his eccentric life in Belize in 2007. Gilson died in a small aircraft in Arizona a year earlier.

Gilson's family blame McAfee for the horrific crash of the married father-of-three who was taking lessons in 'aerotrekking' - a sport that McAfee invented and involves flying a trike at speeds of 75mph.

The wrongful death lawsuit alleges that McAfee hired his 22-year-old nephew, Joel Bitow, as flight instructor even though he didn't possess the right qualifications.

Bitow then took Gilson to one of the most dangerous parts of a canyon in Arizona where they suddenly lost control and went into a spiral dive to their deaths.

After the crash, McAfee sold his 280-acre Woodland Park, in Colorado, a Hawaiian beachfront home and a string of other properties and set up in Belize - he and his money safe outside any U.S. court jurisdiction.

Media scrutiny: John McAfee talks to the media at the Beacon Hotel on the day after he arrived from Guatemala

He returned to the U.S. after being released from a detention center in Guatemala last Wednesday.

McAfee had spent weeks on the run 
from Belizean authorities who wanted to ask him about the death of his 
former neighbor Gregory Viant Faull, 52.

'Why would they want to question me, 
about what?' a tired-looking but sharply dressed McAfee told a throng of
reporters last week.

U.S officials said there was no active arrest warrant for McAfee that would justify taking him into custody.

He said he planned to stay in Miami 
until his girlfriend, 20-year-old Belizean Samantha Vanegas, and a woman
he called 'Amy' could join him.

He begged the State Department to 
expedite visas for his girlfriend he told the media last week. Vanegas 
had accompanied him when he was on the run, but did not go with him to 
the U.S.

McAfee bristled as reporters 
repeatedly asked him why he won't answer questions from officials in 
Belize, denying he was under investigation.

He stressed that he was afraid to 
answer questions because dozens of officials there stormed his property,
killed his dogs, handcuffed him for hours and tried to extort money. He
has not been charged with a crime.

'If they didn't want to harm me, why 
have they been harming my property and my dogs? Now five of my dogs have
been killed,' said McAfee, claiming authorities shot one of his dogs in
the head and raided his house eight times.

He said he had no choice but to flee 
because 'there was a nationwide manhunt for me' and he worried he would 
be thrown in a cell and silenced if captured.

'Did I kill M. Faull? No, let me be clear. I had absolutely nothing to do with the murder in Belize.'

McAfee said he faked a heart attack 
in Guatemala to give his lawyer enough time to file motions keeping him 
from returning to Belize.

'Immediately after, I got well,' he deadpanned.

Media circus: Surrounded by reporters, McAfee speaks at a press conference in Miami

Speaking to ABC News after
landing in Miami, McAfee said admitted that he had 'played the crazy 
card,' and added: 'It was a deception but who did it hurt? I look pretty
healthy, don't I?'

He told the network of his relief when told he wasn't going to be detained by American authorities.

'I was met by a dozen or maybe fewer 
officers. I said, "Am I arrested?" They said, "No, sir, I am here to 
help you." That felt the best of all.'

While seemingly free to roam South Beach, the man who was once worth $100million now says that he has nothing left.

But McAfee did not appear to be in 
total arrears as he flashed a stack of $5 bills, telling ABC: 'My friend
dropped off some cash.'

He criticized the Belizean authorities for failing to catch him, and thanked reporters for their 'role' in securing his escape.

'What's a better story, millionaire 
mad man on the run. [The media] saved my ass. Because you paid attention
to the story. As long as you are reporting, it is hard to whack 
somebody that the world is watching.'

McAfee said he was being persecuted by Belize's ruling party after he refused to pay some $2million in bribes.

Belize's prime minister rejected the allegations, calling McAfee paranoid and 'bonkers.'
