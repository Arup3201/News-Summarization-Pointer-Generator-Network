Mauricio Pochettino believes Harry Kane can score 30 goals for Tottenham Hotspur this season but insists the 21-year-old striker must maintain his focus and desire to improve.

Not since Jurgen Klinsmann in 1994-95 has a Spurs player reached that total in a single campaign, but Kane’s brace against West Bromwich Albion brought him to 20 goals with at least 18 games left.

His impressive displays have seen him strongly tipped to make Roy Hodgson’s squad for England’s forthcoming March internationals.

‘I never put a ceiling on any player,’ said Pochettino, Tottenham’s manager. ‘If he scores 20, why not 30? If you have potential and can improve it is up to you.

‘Always a player can improve. The problem arrives when the player believes he can’t. It is important he keeps this mentality, that he is hungry to keep going.’

Kane said: ‘I set myself (a target of) 10 at the start of the season and then 20. I will set myself another little target that I will try and get to — and do it as quickly as possible. There are still a lot of games to go and I’m feeling confident on the pitch.’

Kane was deadly at The Hawthorns, providing the attacking spearhead as Spurs controlled the game in one of their most complete performances of the season.

Christian Eriksen opened the scoring with a sweet free-kick in the sixth minute, cementing his reputation as an expert from set-pieces and setting the stage for his two-goal team-mate.

Kane’s first was a slick and powerful finish and his second, from the penalty spot, expertly dispatched. It was Kane’s first goal from the spot, with usual penalty-taker Andros Townsend not on the pitch.

Pochettino will let the players decide who takes penalties in future. ‘It’s a feeling. It’s an emotion,’ he said. ‘If it’s Andros, if it’s Harry, they decide on the pitch. They are both specialists.’

West Brom tried to mount a comeback with Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris producing three wonderful saves to deny James Morrison, Claudio Yacob and Saido Berahino while Craig Dawson hit the crossbar.

Christian Eriksen’s superb free-kick takes him to nine league goals for the season. That tally makes him the top scoring midfield player in the Premier League in 2014-15. 

But the hosts were well beaten and Albion boss Tony Pulis is desperate for reinforcements before Monday night's transfer deadline. 

Joleon Lescott operated at left back for the second game in succession after the FA Cup win over Birmingham, highlighting an area Pulis wants to strengthen. Lescott, a centre back, does not wish to play there regularly.

‘The manager has asked me to do a job but I came here to play centre half,’ he said. ‘I am not a left back. I might be able to hold my own now and again but we need specific players in their right positions.’

Pulis added: ‘I’m not spinning as many plates as I usually spin, but if the ones drop for us I’ll be very pleased. We’re battling away with every other team in the Premier League to try and improve.’  

West Brom manager Tony Pulis is hoping to add to his squad before Monday night's 11pm transfer deadline
