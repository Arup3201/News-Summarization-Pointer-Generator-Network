Latest probe said to have found signs of short-circuiting and overheating

Airbus will drop Lithium-Ion batteries and switch to traditional nickel-cadmium batteries for its new A350 passenger jet in the wake of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's 'exploding battery' mystery.

Airbus said it had taken the decision to prevent further delays in initial deliveries of the A350 amid uncertainty over whether investigations into Boeing's battery problems would lead to a regulation overhaul.

It comes weeks after all 50 of Boeing's brand new Dreamliners were grounded indefinitely following two on-board fires, believed to have been sparked by faulty batteries.

Concerns: The Airbus construction facilities in Hamburg. Airbus said it had taken the decision to prevent further delays in initial deliveries of the A350 amid uncertainty over whether investigations into Boeing's battery problems would lead to changes in regulations

'We want to mature the Lithium-Ion technology but we are making this decision today to protect the A350's entry into service schedule,' an Airbus spokeswoman said today.

Industry executives, insurers and safety officials said the technology's reliability was under heavy scrutiny as investigators struggle to find the cause of incidents that led to the grounding of Boeing's Dreamliner fleet.

Earlier this month, experts probing 
the fire on a Dreamliner released 
fresh images of the charred battery at the centre of the investigation.

Delayed again: The A350 is due to enter service in the second half of 2014 compared with an initial target of 2012 when it was launched as Europe's answer to the light-weight 787 Dreamliner

Pictures showed the blackened remains
 of the lithium device as well as a frayed and broken earth wire, 
designed to reduce the risk of electric shock, which was attached to it 
at the time it ignited.

Investigators also confirmed that 
they had linked the in-flight fire which forced the All Nippon Airways 
service to make an emergency landing in Japan last month to a similar 
incident in Boston.

The
latest probe is said to have found evidence of short-circuiting and 
'thermal runaway' - a chemical reaction which causes overheating.

Warning: It comes weeks after all 50 of Boeing's brand new Dreamliners were grounded indefinitely following two on-board fires, believed to have been sparked by faulty batteries

Overheated: The charred battery from the Dreamliner plane which made an emergency landing on January 16 in Takamatsu, is inspected by the manufacturer at the headquarters of GS Yuasa Corp in Kyoto, western Japan

The A350 is due to enter service in the second half of 2014 compared with an initial target of 2012 when it was launched as Europe's answer to the light-weight 787 Dreamliner.

Airbus will use Lithium-Ion batteries for initial test flights due to start in the summer of 2013 but make the switch to the traditional and slightly heavier nickel-cadmium battery before the plane enters service.

French company Saft makes the Lithium-Ion battery that has been ditched for the A350 and supplies traditional nickel-cadmium ones to the rest of Airbus product range.

Link: Investigators found similar damage to the lithium ion battery occured in both incident

Damage: A ground wire which was attached to the burnt battery is showed charred, frayed and broken

A Saft spokeswoman said on Friday that Airbus was expected to use Saft nickel-cadmium batteries to replace the Lithium-Ion batteries it has been developing.

Saft shares were off 0.17 percent at 20.11 euros at 0851 GMT while EADS shares were down 0.43 percent at 34.74 euros.
