Former Arsenal and Barcelona attacker Thierry Henry has praised the consistency of Real Madrid ace Cristiano Ronaldo, but insists his former teammate Lionel Messi is still the better player.

Messi has been outshone in recent seasons with Ronaldo scooping the Ballon d'Or award for two successive years at the expense of the Argentine.

But despite believing four-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi is the better player, Henry was quick to stress that fans should enjoy watching the duo whatever their preference.

'I played alongside Leo, so there's my answer,' the Frenchman replied when asked by Fifa.com which one of the two he prefers. 'I have an enormous amount of respect for Cristiano, as someone who maintains such a high level for several years.

'It's one thing to have a good season, and then have another four years later but to keep up with that level for consecutive years is something else.

'People realise it, of course, but I feel like we still don't grasp the real measure of what these two are doing. In the future, people will look back in awe at the continuity, the goals and the pressure that comes along with doing this for so long.

'So I'm full of respect for Ronaldo, but I played with Leo and had extraordinary moments with him, we lost and won together, so that is all I have to say on Leo.'
