As one of the world's most in-demand models, looking good is the key to Jourdan Dunn's career.

With countless catwalk appearances and major campaigns under her belt, Jourdan is clearly doing something right...so what's her secret?

FEMAIL caught up with the Maybelline New York ambassadress to find out - and we discovered that an exhaustive eight-step beauty regime that takes her nearly an hour a day is behind her flawless supermodel skin. 

Jourdan Dunn is one of the most esteemed supermodels in the world so FEMAIL caught up with her about her skincare regime, diet and favourite fashion week moments

Sharing her 'hardcore' beauty regime, Jourdan told us: 'I visited Tokyo and became obsessed with their skincare, which is very advanced. Their regimes have loads more steps but I incorporated some of their techniques into mine and developed my own eight step regime. 

'It takes me a good twenty minutes in the morning and then about half an hour in the evening.'

The secret behind her flawless skin? An eight step skincare regime and lip balm as eyeshadow and cheek tint

Jourdan, who has been sitting front row at fashion week and is currently the face of Burberry, has picked up some quirky beauty tips during her time in the industry. 

Her favourites? 'Hold a credit card behind your lashes when you apply your mascara. If you press against the card you get a wide-eyed, curled effect without getting lots of product on your eyelid,' she advised.

She also swears by using lip balm as an eyeshadow to give a 'glossy' finish (her favourite is Maybelline Baby Lips Lip Balm), and she often uses the pink tinted ones as blusher. 

Jourdan has been working for Maybelline New York since last April and gave the brand's new products a spin over London Fashion Week

When it comes to beauty, 24-year-old Jourdan, an accomplished cook who runs her own cookery YouTube channel, believes it's all about what you put in.

'I like to eat healthy,' she said. 'I love good greens and fish and I'm not really a snacker. 

'Luckily the backstage catering at fashion week has improved. There used to be nothing or just really boring food but they've really stepped it up. Diane Von Furstenberg even had an amazing gluten-free buffet backstage at her show.'

To keep herself sane amid the backstage madness, Jourdan swears by meditating, which she says helps her 'zone out'. She cites her favourite thing about fashion week as seeing her friends (a roll call of the coolest young models in the industry including Cara Delevingne, Karlie Kloss, Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid).

'I don't get to see my friends very often and travelling around the world for shows can be really lonely and boring so I love it when me and my pals are all together for a catch-up,' she said. 

Jourdan, seen walking in Naomi Campbell's charity Fashion For Relief show, is currently the face of Burberry alongside her fellow supermodel

The six foot clothes horse, who has been dubbed the modern-day Naomi Campbell, has been working as the face of Maybelline New York since April last year.

Jourdan joined an elite group of models who have worked for the brand, including Christy Turlington, Adriana Lima, Erin Wasson, Emily DiDonato and Mollie King.

As a  Vogue regular, who was scouted in Primark in her teens, Jourdan was on the road to success very early in her career.

When she's not on the catwalk, Jourdan is a proud mother to her son Riley, who was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia

She's clocked up campaigns for Balmain, DKNY, Victoria's Secret and Topshop and walked in the Olympics closing ceremony alongside Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss. 

When she's not on the catwalk, Jourdan is a proud mother to her son Riley, who was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia.

This has led to Jourdan’s active involvement as the Parent Ambassador for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America and the future is looking bright for the young starlet.

She explained: 'I am collaborating on a sunglasses range and designing my own kidswear line. My son is really involved and has been helping me choose the colours and designs.'
