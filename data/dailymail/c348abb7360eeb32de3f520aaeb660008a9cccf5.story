Peaches Geldof and her family joined Tamara Beckwith and her daughter at the opening of Dolce and Gabbana's first children's store in the UK.

Dressed in an on-trend black lace dress, 24-year-old Peaches posed and played with her two sons, 1-year-old Astala Dylan Willow Geldof-Cohen and 8-month-old Phaedra Bloom Forever Cohen, at the opening.

She was joined by husband Tom Cohen, lead singer of the band S.C.U.M, who looked dapper in a black suit.

There's no doubt that fashion-forward
Peaches and Tamara will be dressing their children in the brand's 2014 
range, which offers detailed floral dresses for girls and denim shirts for boys.

The London store is the brand's second, the first Dolce and Gabanna children's boutique opened in Milan last year.

Speaking about their decision to 
branch out into children's wear, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, the 
design duo behind the house, said: 'To us, it's like going back to when we began our adventure: full of ideas.'
