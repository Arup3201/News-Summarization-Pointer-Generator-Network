Blow: The poor result will come as an embarrassing blow to Chancellor George Osborne's Project Merlin agreement

Net lending by banks to cash-strapped businesses collapsed by nearly £10billion last year, figures revealed yesterday.

The Bank of England statistics make a mockery of Project Merlin, the Government's attempt to encourage banks to boost credit for companies.

The figures come as a survey by financial specialist Bibby Financial Services reveals the owners of small firms are resorting to drawing on personal savings to keep their businesses going.

A separate survey of more than 11,000 members of the Federation of Small Businesses showed a third had used their own savings to fund their businesses.

The Bank of England figures offer a devastating insight into how five of Britain's biggest banks – Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, Barclays and Santander – behaved towards firms last year.

The figures show that between January and December, net lending – the amount of money handed out by the banks minus the amount that was repaid – slumped by £9.6billion.

This means banks received £9.6billion more in loan repayments than they paid out.

Overall, the gross lending target to small firms was £76billion, but the five banks managed to hand out only £74.9billion.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'Small firms are still finding it too difficult to secure the finance they need.'

Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, said the promises of Project Merlin 'were not worth the paper they were written on'.

Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat 
peer who resigned over Project Merlin, said the lack of lending was 'a 
knife in the back for growth and jobs'.

Figures: The Bank of England's 2012 'Trends in Lending' data is not directly comparable with the Project Merlin figures, but shows that net lending to SMEs has actually been falling since 2008

To blame: RBS which is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer, is being blamed for the shortfall after the other four lenders beat their targets

Failure to deliver: Santander, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and RBS saw combined net lending slide in 2011, including a 3 per cent drop in the final quarter

'Project Merlin has failed to make the banks lend,' he said. 'We must 
impose lending targets on our nationalised banks as in our coalition 
agreement.'

Phil McCabe, from the Forum of Private Business, added: 'Despite the 
Project Merlin targets, banks have consistently failed substantially to
 increase lending to the small firms that need it most.

Under Project Merlin, Britain's top five banks agreed to lend businesses - and especially small businesses - more money in 2011.

George Osborne's now rather embarrassing policy, which was finalised in February last year, also sought to make the top five pay less in bonuses than in 2010 and be more transparent about their pay packages.

HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, RBS, Barclays and Santander all committed to making £190bn of credit available to businesses last year, up on the £179bn figure of 2010.

A figure of £76bn of that was supposed to be made available to small businesses, an increase of 15 per cent on the previous year.

The big five also agreed to give £200m to David Cameron's Big Society Bank, which is supposed to finance community projects.

An extra £1bn of equity capital over three years was also due to the Business Growth Fund, which helps SMEs in deprived areas of the UK.

Project Merlin was designed to help SMEs who complained of being starved of credit since the financial crises.

It also aimed to reign in the bonus culture that so incensed the tax payer following the banking collapse and make the City more transparent in terms of salaries and bonuses.

However, results show the top five missed their lending target by more than £1bn.

Meanwhile, Osborne was preparing to green light more than £500million in bonuses for RBS bankers later this month.

'Lending costs remain punishingly high. We are urging banks to consider a
 range of lending risk criteria, such as firms which can show they have 
lots of big orders in the pipeline.'

However, Mark 
Hoban, financial secretary to the Treasury, the overall lending figures were 'good news' and that 
lending to British businesses 'has increased by 20 per cent over the last
 year as a result of the Merlin agreement, with lending to SMEs also up 
by 13 per cent.'

'Ensuring that businesses can access 
the credit they need to grow and create jobs is vital, which is why the 
Government is now making up to £21 billion of guarantees available 
through credit easing,' he said.

'But banks need to play their part by continuing 
to support British business going forward.'

Under the Project Merlin
 agreement, Britain's top five banks also agreed to pay less in bonuses than in 2010 and be more transparent about their pay packets.

The lending news comes as the Chancellor is preparing to green light more than £500million in bonuses for RBS bankers later this month.

RBS CEO Stephen Hester last month waived his £963,000 bonus but other senior bankers at the firm can look forward to multi-million pound payouts.

Meanwhile, the number of small businesses that have used a bank overdraft or loan has fallen in the past two years, according to the Federation of Small Businesses, despite Project Merlin.

The survey of 11,000 FSB members found that only 35 per cent has used an overdraft in 2011, 11 per cent a secured bank loan and 7 per cent an unsecured bank loan.

The survey also found that 33 per cent of respondents had used their own savings or inheritance to fund their business while 34 per cent got money from friends and family and only 25 per cent used a bank overdraft.

John Walker, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'We have long said that targets are the wrong instrument to encourage lending and growth.

'Even though overall lending is above target, this shows that money is going to bigger businesses and not new and fledgling firms that need it to take advantage of growth opportunities that are there even in these challenging times.

'Our research in the last two years shows that around a third of businesses are refused credit and this could be reflected in the fact that newer businesses are using more of their own money to fund their business rather than turn to the banks for help.

'What we need to see is better promotion of the alternatives available and for the Government to put in place their bold credit easing plans, which will help small businesses access finance on better terms.'
