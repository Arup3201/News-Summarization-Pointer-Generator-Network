Maggots, fingernails and shards of metal have been found in various Aldi food products according to disgusted customers.

The most recent complaint has come from Adrian Chew who was quick to abandon his bolognese recipe after finding a maggot in a jar of Remano Tomato Paste from an Aldi store at Abbotsford in Melbourne, Fairfax reports.

However, despite the supermarket chain issuing an apology to the couple and launching an investigation into the breach in food safety, more shoppers have begun to come forward with their own disgusting discoveries.

A Melbourne woman revealed that she had also found live maggots in a box of discounted Mozart Chocolate in December.

'They were my favourite chocolates, but I can't even look at them now,' she told Fairfax.

Another customer, Tania Ewing, waited three months for a response from Aldi after her daughter discovered a human nail in a container of ice-cream purchased at an Aldi in Brunswick late last year.

Meanwhile, a woman who bought a jar of Bramwells peanut butter from another one of the chain's Melbourne stores has had her complaint dismissed despite having found a shard of metal at the bottom of the jar.

'It looked like the tip of a knife, but all my knives are intact. I suspect it was something in the manufacturing equipment that broke off,' she told Fairfax.

Aldi has however apologised to one man who claimed to have found a starfish arm in a tin of Ocean Rise smoked mussels.

He told Fairfax that he was dissatisfied by the response and was concerned that the starfish could have been a poisonous species.

The complaints appear to be on a wider scale than Australia after a woman in the U.S. discovered maggots in a pack of potatoes she bought from an Aldi store in Arkansas

Complaints have also been made about the company's products outside Australia, with one woman in the U.S. discovering maggots in a pack of potatoes she bought from an Aldi store in Arkansas.

'Just got home from #Aldi and realized bag of potatoes was rotten! #maggots #disgusting 30 min trip now to get $ back,' Brandi Goolsby Tweeted in late September.

An Aldi spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Chew's complaint was being investigated 'thoroughly' with supplier and that the tomato paste had been collected for testing.

'For the isolated incidents mentioned, those customers that have been in contact with ALDI have been responded to,' the spokesperson said.

'We are committed to providing our customers with safe products of the highest quality. All complaints are raised individually and investigated with extremely high importance. ALDI will always remove any product from sale if it is identified as a risk to our customers.'
