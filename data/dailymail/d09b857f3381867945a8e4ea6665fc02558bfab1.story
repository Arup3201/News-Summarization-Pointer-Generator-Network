It was the very company which threatened the existence of electricals retail giant Dixons, but now the 77-year-old company is in talks for a potential £3.5billion merger with the Carphone Warehouse.

Many thought the death knell was about to sound for the British electrical goods retailer when, in 2008, US retailer Best Buy announced plans to open a chain of stores in Europe, in which it would be able to use the local knowledge of its mobile phone operator partner.

But after a remarkable turnaround, the British retailer, which has been a staple of the high street since it was founded in 1937, is now itself looking to merge with the Carphone Warehouse after seeing off the challenge of the American firm.

Dixons has been a staple of the British high street since it was formed in 1937. It is now in talks with the Carphone Warehouse over a potential £3.5billion merger

Dixons was turned into a multi-billion pound retail operation under the leadership of Lord Stanley Kalms (pictured), who stepped down in 2002

Dixons Retail Group, Europe's No. 2 electricals retailer, said the discussions are at an early stage and that no decisions have been made about how a tie-up might be structured. Both companies are valued at around £1.75billion on the London stock market.

Carphone was founded in 1989 by Charles Dunstone, who still owns 23 per cent of the company. It has more than 2,000 stores across Europe.

Former Dixons chief executive John Browett, who joined the company at the end of 2007 and left in 2012 to join Apple, has been credited with overhauling the business, while current boss Sebastian James is said to have continued the transformation.

In the seven months after the Carphone Warehouse announced it was joining forces with Best Buy in May 2008, the share prices for Dixons fell from 51.75p to just 6.75p. At the same as the announcement the retailer's other stores, Currys and PC World, appeared to be losing out to competition from the internet and supermarkets and the unfolding economic crisis battered the high street.

However, the store has now seen a change in fortunes - it only trails Media-Saturn, owned by German retailer Metro, by annual sales in Europe, and has seen its shares increase by 74 per cent over the last year.

The moment of its turnaround arguably arrived just as credit insurer Atradius reduced its cover guaranteeing payments to the retailer's suppliers, according to The Times.

At the same time, in November 2008, Best Buy was issuing its first ever profits warnings. Mr Browett however had been left encouraged by the new Currys Megastore in Wednesbury, near Birmingham which took £2.3m in its first four days.

The American firm eventually opened its first store in Essex in April 2010 but the business, unfamiliar with British buyers, never really took off and by 2012 it closed its ten 'big box' megastores it had opened in the joint venture with Carphone Warehouse.

Dixons however was going from strength to strength, aided by an exclusive deal to distribute the iPad.

The company has since recently reported its second year in a row of improved Christmas trading as it benefited from the demise of rival Comet.

New chief executive Mr James recently off-loaded its loss-making e-commerce business PIXmania, operations in Turkey, and partially exited Italy.

He has meanwhile, made no secret of his desire to increase the firm's exposure to mobile phones, making the Carphone Warehouse a seemingly obvious partner.

The two companies said in a statement yesterday: ‘The boards of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse note the recent speculation and confirm that the two companies are in preliminary discussions regarding a possible merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse.

‘These discussions are at a very preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that a transaction will be forthcoming. No decision has been reached regarding the structuring of any such merger.’

Dixons has more than 500 stores across the UK and Ireland, predominantly in out-of-town retail parks and increasingly as '2-in-1' Currys PC World stores.

The company has an ongoing relationship with Phones4U, which sees Carphone's rival offer PC World and Currys customers the latest mobile technology in a number of stores.

Nick Bubb, an independent retail analysts said: ‘In a world of “connected devices”, Dixons is under-exposed to the key area of mobile/smartphone retailing and it is known that they were looking at getting more involved in the area.

‘Dixons’ ebullient CEO Seb James hasn’t seemed entirely satisfied with the arrangement with Phones4U, and if you want to be involved in this market you ought to be in bed with the best-in-class operator, which is undoubtedly Carphone.'

The move comes after Dixons announced it was selling its poorly performing mobile phone stores The Link to O2 for £30m in June 2006.

At the time, DSG interntional admitted it could no longer compete with the likes of Carphone Warehouse or the mobile phone operators' own chains as it said it was near to completing the sale of its 60 per cent stake in The Link to O2, the owner of the other 40 per cent.
