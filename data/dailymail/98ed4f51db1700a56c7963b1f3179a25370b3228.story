A Japanese politician has been barred from attending his local council meetings after refusing to take off his wrestling mask.

Skull Reaper A-Ji was elected to a seat in the city of Oita last month with just 2,828 votes.

But he immediately faced problems when fellow members of the assembly said it was not appropriate for him to conceal his identity with the mask.

The 44-year-old refused to back down insisting that he had worn his trademark red and black leather mask during campaigning and that he should be allowed 'freedom of expression'.

A-ji, who has promised to fight for educational reform and improved social welfare facilities, told a group of reporters last month, 'My mask is my uniform. I even wear it to weddings, so I will not remove it.'

But the Japanese council held a vote and
decided that A-Ji would not be allowed to attend in his mask because it
would 'offend the decency of the Assembly'.

Skull Reaper A-ji described the decision as 'frustrating.'

'If I take my mask off, I'm an entirely different person,' he told the Nikkan Sports newspaper. 'I will not take it off.'

'People find it easy to come up and talk to me because I have a mask on,' A-Ji he told the Nishinippon Shimbun, adding that he has done a lot for the community for more than a decade, including visiting institutions for people with physical disabilities.

A number of politicians who choose to wear wrestling masks have been elected at the local level in Japan, including a councillor who goes by the name Super Delfin in Osaka and the former professional wrestler The Great Sasuke, who was elected to represent Iwate Prefecture in 2003.
