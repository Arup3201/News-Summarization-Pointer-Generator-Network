A screenshot (pictured) posted to Reddit is the first to show how Whatsapp's Calls feature will look

Whatsapp first hinted it would let users make free calls to each other early last year.

And it now seems the hugely popular messaging app has started rolling out the feature to a select number of users.

A screenshot, posted to Reddit at the weekend, reveals how the Calls tool  looks on a Nexus 5 device running Android Lollipop.

In the image, a new tab has been added that shows 'Calls', in addition to the existing 'Chats' and 'Contacts' options.

Users can then open the Calls tab, select a contact and make a voice call using an internet connection. 

This is similar to how Skype connects web-based calls, a service known as 'voice over internet protocol' or VoIP. 

In December, Dutch site AndroidWorld uncovered clues about Whatsapp's voice calling feature while studying the app's test code.

Expert Sander Tuit then extracted layout files, images and text from the raw code to create a series of mock-up screenshots. 

The latest grab was posted to Reddit by user pradnesh07, although it has since been removed because it contained personal details.

Other messaging apps, including Viber, already offer free voice and video calls to users, and it's believed Whatsapp's update is designed to rival such services.

The new tool is only available to select users, but if someone with the feature calls someone without it, it forces the update

On Viber, the Calls tab shows all the voice calls received, made and missed, and Whatsapp's update is expected to feature a similar log.

According to Reddit, the update is only available to a select number of users, but if someone with the update tries to call someone without it, the call forces the recipient to download the new tool.

It is not known when the feature will roll out more widely and MailOnline has contacted Whatsapp for comment. 

Skype was one of the first firms to make VoIP a mainstream technology, and last year it launched a translator. 

The beta version of its live translation tool lets people speak to others in another language - even if they don’t know what they’re saying.

The tool then translates speech instantly, providing both text and spoken translations. 

The public version launched with English and Spanish translations, but the Microsoft-owned firm is looking to add more than 40 languages to the service.

Google also recently launched a live translation tool to is Google Translate app, and this could be the next step for messaging apps such as Viber and Whatsapp. 

Last year, Whatsapp  updated its service to make it harder to avoid messages.

The Facebook-owned app now displays two blue ticks in the bottom right-hand corner of an individual message to show it has been read. 

To use the new Whatsapp tool, users open the Calls tab, select a contact and make a voice call using an internet connection. This is similar to how Skype (pictured), for example, connects web-based calls, using a service called 'voice over  internet protocol' or VoIP

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) lets people make free, or low cost, telephone calls over the web.

Popular VoIP services include Viber and Skype. 

VoIP can be used anywhere in the world and can call landline and mobile numbers. 

And clicking on the message shows the precise time the recipient opened and read it.

Before the update, there were only two types of tick - a single grey tick meant the message had been successfully sent, and a double grey tick meant it had been delivered.

Now, when a message has been sent, delivered and read, the double grey tick turns blue.

In a group chat, the second ticks appear when all participants in the group have received the message.

The two blue ticks only appear when all participants in the group have read the post.

To see what time the messages were read users can now press and hold down on a particular post.

Again, this is similar to a 'read' feature that was already being used by Viber.

In the case of group messages, this reveals what time each individual member read it (pictured)
