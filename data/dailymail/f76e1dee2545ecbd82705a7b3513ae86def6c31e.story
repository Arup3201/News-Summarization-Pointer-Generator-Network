Scientist Smile, who has been jailed for ten and a half years after threatening a couple in their own home with a machete

A thug who threatened two pensioners with a machete during a terrifying robbery in their own home has been jailed for ten years.

Scientist Smile broke into the couple's property in Merry Hill in the West Midlands, with two accomplices earlier this year on July 6.

After gaining access to the house via a bathroom window, the three men disturbed a 60-year-old woman who had got out of bed to go to the toilet around 12.15am.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that the raiders then dragged the petrified homeowner around the house in her dressing gown back to her bedroom.

They then woke the woman's sleeping husband, also aged 60, by punching him in the face and demanding gold and the location of the safe.

The couple were also threatened with a machete before the thugs fled with just £100, bank cards and a mobile phone.

West Midlands Police launched an investigation and arrested Smile, aged 20, at his home in Handsworth, Birmingham, on July 14 after tracking a stolen mobile phone, which linked him to the crime.

He admitted one count of robbery at a previous hearing and was jailed for ten-and-a-half years at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

After the case Detective Constable Nick Taylor, from Wolverhampton CID, who investigated the raid, said: 'This was a violent and terrifying attack on a couple in their own home.

'Both the occupants of the house were assaulted as their attackers clearly believed there were items of significant value inside the house but ultimately fled with very little.

Smile, 20, of Handsworth in Birmingham had admitted one count of robbery before he was sentenced at Wolverhampton Crown Court, pictured 

'This is a significant sentence for a man who showed no mercy in his determination to get what he wanted.

'Hopefully the sentence offers some comfort to his victims whilst sending a message that this kind of crime will not be tolerated, and comes with lengthy sentences.'

Detectives are still trying to track down the other two men involved in the attack.
