Britain could face a eurozone-style currency crisis if Scotland votes for independence, leading bankers have warned.

Goldman Sachs said a Yes vote 'could have severe consequences' for both Scotland and the rest of the UK.

It cited the rush to withdraw money from Greece and Spain, which led to economic turmoil and mass unemployment.

Goldman Sachs has warned of the 'severe consequences' for both Scotland and the rest of the UK if voters back independence on September 18

Kevin Daly, a senior economist at the firm, said the Bank of England could be forced to use taxpayers' money to prop up the pound within hours of a Yes vote. Even this would not prevent 'negative consequences', he added.

The prospect of Scottish independence saw sterling approach a five-month low this week, after polls showed the No campaign's lead had dropped significantly.

Ed Miliband will today become the latest high-profile Westminster politician aiming to shore up the pro-union vote.

He will tell Scottish voters not to use their referendum to rid themselves of the Tory-led government because he says he'll win the general election.

The Labour leader will claim the Conservatives are 'on their way out' in an attempt to persuade his party's traditional voters to reject independence.

SNP leader Alex Salmond, who visited Brownings Bakers bakery in Kilmarnock yesterday, has seen a surge in support for independence

The latest opinion polls show up to 30 per cent of Labour's natural supporters may be ready to switch allegiance and back Alex Salmond's plan to break up Britain. 

Many are thought to have been wooed by the SNP's message that a vote for independence would mean Scotland would no longer be ruled by English Tory ministers sitting in Westminster. 

Now, in a speech at Blantyre in South Lanarkshire, Mr Miliband will make a series of pledges in a bid to shore up the No vote.

The tone of the speech is in marked contrast to the pro-union campaign so far, which has seen the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats working closely together. It is understood the new tactic was signed off by Tory strategists within the Better Together campaign.

Winning over undecided Scots in Labour heartlands such as Glasgow is seen as crucial to reviving the No campaign, which has seen its lead slip from 22 percentage points to just six in one month. Mr Miliband will say that 'as Prime Minister' in eight months' time he will tax bankers' bonuses, raise the minimum wage, introduce a new higher rate of tax and abolish the so-called bedroom tax.

'The SNP want to tell you we can't defeat the Tories. They are wrong,' he will say. 'Change is coming in the UK - the Tories are on their way out. They are losing their MPs, they are defecting, divided and downhearted.

'A Labour government is within our grasp. With that election in just eight months' time the change Scotland needs is on its way. Electing a Labour government is the way to change Scotland.' 

He will claim: 'We will abolish the bedroom tax. Abolish it in Dundee, in Glasgow, but also in Carlisle, Newcastle and Nottingham.' 

Mr Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg were accused of complacency at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, as the main parties were urged to 'drop everything' and fight for a No vote.

Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh said: 'If we were to lose the Union, it would be not only a disaster for Scotland, but a national humiliation of catastrophic proportions.' 

Mr Cameron replied: 'The leaders of the parties in this House have all put aside their differences and said that, in spite of the political differences we have, we all agree about one thing: not only is Scotland better off inside the United Kingdom, but the United Kingdom is better off with Scotland inside it.' 

Of the 650 MPs in Westminster, 59 represent Scottish seats; Labour, which accounts for 41 of these, would be the hardest-hit by a Yes vote. Without Scotland, the Tories would have had a 21-seat majority at the 2010 election.

The Scottish Nationalists' campaign has been boosted by two polls in the last week, which suggested 47 per cent of decided voters will back independence, compared with 53 per cent who will vote No.

Mr Daly warned: 'Even if the sterling monetary union does not break up in the event of a Yes vote, the threat of a break-up would provide investors with a strong incentive to sell Scottish-based assets, and households with a strong incentive to withdraw deposits from Scottishbased banks.

'The most important specific risk, in our view, is that the uncertainty over whether an independent Scotland would be able to retain sterling as its currency could result in a [Europe-style] currency crisis occurring within the UK.'
