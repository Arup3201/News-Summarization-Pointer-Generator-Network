Andy Murray yesterday completed an extraordinary comeback in an epic Wimbledon quarter-final - winning the last three sets after losing the first two of his encounter with Fernando Verdasco.

The British number one beat the 29-year-old Spaniard - known as the Muscles of Madrid - on Centre Court as he continued his bid to go one better than last year and win the tournament.

But after a Wimbledon full of slip-ups, Murray, 26, had to be in top form to progress after losing the first two sets 6-3 6-4. He fought 
back to claim the third set 6-1, the fourth 6-4 and the fifth 7-5.

Murray had gone down 6-4 in his 
second set to the Spaniard - putting Verdasco up 2-0 in sets - and 
retired to his chair before screaming: 'What the f*** are you doing? 
What the f*** are you doing?'.

BBC
commentator Andrew Castle made an apology for the audible remarks - 
saying the broadcaster apologised for the language, but added he could 
understand the frustration felt by the British star.

Kim Sears suffered along with the 
rest of the UK as her boyfriend went two sets down before emerging the 
victor against unseeded Verdasco after three-and-a-half nailbiting 
hours.

She grimaced and gasped in horror as Murray made a series of blunders in the first half of the match.

But as he clawed his way back into contention she jumped up and punched the air in delight, shouting: ‘Whoo!, come on!’

When the Centre Court crowd rose as 
one as Murray finally secured victory she collapsed back in her seat in 
relief and was seen mouthing: ‘Get in’.

Minutes after the match, 25-year-old 
Miss Sears was herself cheered by the Wimbledon crowds as she ran 
through the All England Club on her way to congratulate her boyfriend.

Murray’s mother, Judy, who had looked 
on anxiously throughout the match, was seen punching the air as Murray 
broke Verdasco’s serve and prepared to serve for the match.

The win means Murray remains on course
to become the first British player to lift the men’s Wimbledon trophy 
since Fred Perry in 1936.

Murray last night paid tribute to the 
Centre Court crowd after earlier in the week saying he missed the 
‘raucous’ atmosphere at the All England Club when he won gold at the 
London Olympics.

He said: ‘I love it when it’s like 
that. It was extremely noisy. They were right into it pretty much every 
single point. It was good today, especially when I went behind.’

Roars also echoed across Murray Mount –
formerly known as Henman Hill – where thousands of people packed on to 
the steep bank to watch the Scot fight to victory.

Mandy Stapleton, 51, from Teddington, west London, described the experience as ‘absolutely amazing’.

She said: ‘We were worried he was 
going to lose but he did it. Wow! We hope he can get through and win, we
hope he can do it. This is his best chance this year.’

Miss Sears had deviated from her usual
safe choice of outfit with an edgier style yesterday. She teamed a 
bright coral blazer with black and white floral trousers as she took her
seat to watch her boyfriend play.

Murray will now face 24th seed Jerzy 
Janowicz in tomorrow’s semi-finals, after the Pole beat his compatriot 
Lukasz Kubot on Court One.

The other semi-final is between top seed Novak Djokovic and eighth seed Juan Martin del Potro.

Verdasco was widely tipped to lose to Murray – but he does have one advantage over the British player.

And Murray’s mother is said to be 
among his admirers. He first came to the attention of Mrs Murray, 53, in
Monte Carlo two years ago, when she stood behind him and fellow 
heart-throb Feliciano Lopez in an accreditation queue.

It was then that she coined the nickname ‘Deliciano’ for Lopez – a label that has stuck ever since.

She wrote on her blog: ‘I joined the 
accreditation queue behind a bevy of Spaniards. Yes I do mean to use the
word bevy as it included ‘Deliciano’ Lopez and Fernando Verdasco. Not 
the worst queue I’ve ever been in.’
