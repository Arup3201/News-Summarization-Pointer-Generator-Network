The NSW Government has announced a $100,000 reward to solve the bashing murder of former AC/DC manager who was killed in Sydney more than 20 years ago.

Crispin Dye, from far North Queensland, was visiting friends and family in Sydney in December 1993 when he was assaulted and robbed of his wallet after drinking with friends in Surry Hills and Darlinghurst.

The 41-year-old was taken to St Vincent's Hospital after suffering major head injuries.

The long-time manager for the Australian rock band was later transferred to St George Hospital for specialist treatment but died two days later, on Christmas Day, 1993.

A witness reported seeing three males of Pacific Islander appearance, aged in their late teens or early twenties standing over Mr Dye's unconscious body, before they ran from the scene in a northerly direction towards Goulburn Street.

The incident occurred during a spate of gay-hate killings in Sydney.

'There are people out there who know those responsible for Mr Dye’s death and we’re hoping this reward may prompt them to get in touch with police,' Detective Superintendent Mick Willing said in a statement.

'By all accounts, Crispin Dye was a fun-loving, friendly and decent man, who was robbed of his life far too soon.

'We are absolutely committed to getting to the bottom of this case and bringing those responsible for an innocent man’s violent death to justice, but we won’t be able to do it without assistance from the public.'

Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Stuart Ayres, said Mr Dye’s family and friends had been suffering for more than 20 years, and deserved to see Crispin’s killers brought to justice.

'It’s now been more than two decades since Mr Dye was killed, and yet his poor friends and family still don’t know who is responsible,' Minister Ayres said.

'We know detectives are doing everything they can to solve the case, and we are hopeful that this $100,000 reward offer will help them in their pursuit of Mr Dye’s killers.'
