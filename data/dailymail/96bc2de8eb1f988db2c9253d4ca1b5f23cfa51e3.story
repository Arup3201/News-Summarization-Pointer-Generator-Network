Julian Assange has launched an attack on Google - saying the search giant has turned 'big and bad', and characterizing its chairman Eric Schmidt as a Government agent trying to further U.S. 'imperialist' ambitions.

The Wikileaks founder, who is under a Justice Department criminal investigation for leaking thousands of classified diplomatic cables, lashed out at the internet giant in an extract from an upcoming book.

Assange, who has spent the past two years claiming asylum to avoid facing rape accusations, also detailed connections between Schmidt and the U.S. establishment and implied Google is acting as a front to enact U.S. foreign policy.

'Big and bad': Assange said that Google is a 'serious concern' to much of the world due to its power

His attack on the search company came in an extract from his upcoming book, When Google Met Wikileaks, which was published in Newsweek magazine.

In a lengthy extract Assange hits out at the friendly image of the company - which has the official motto 'Don't be evil'.

Despite its cuddly image and free services, he said, Google's mass harvesting of data and dominance of the internet are cause for 'serious concern' worldwide.

He said: 'Nobody wants to acknowledge that Google has grown big and bad. But it has. Schmidt’s tenure as CEO saw Google integrate with the shadiest of U.S. power structures as it expanded into a geographically invasive megacorporation.'

He then listed personal visits by Schmidt to politically sensitive countries, and referred to alleged support from the U.S. Government for him to advance their objectives.

He wrote: 'Schmidt’s emergence as Google’s “foreign minister” - making pomp and ceremony state visits across geopolitical fault lines - had not come out of nowhere; it had been presaged by years of assimilation within U.S. establishment networks of reputation and influence.

'On a personal level, Schmidt and Cohen [the other Google executive he met] are perfectly likable people.

'But Google’s chairman is a classic “head of industry” player, with all of the ideological baggage that comes with that role. Schmidt fits exactly where he is: the point where the centrist, liberal and imperialist tendencies meet in American political life.'

He later warns of Google's ambitions to become an 'empire' with influence reaching across the world.

Assange wrote: 'Google is steadily becoming the Internet for many people.

'Its influence on the choices and behavior of the totality of individual human beings translates to real power to influence the course of history... 

'If the future of the Internet is to be Google, that should be of serious concern to people all over the world - in Latin America, East and Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, the former Soviet Union and even in Europe - for whom the Internet embodies the promise of an alternative to U.S. cultural, economic, and strategic hegemony.'

'A “don’t be evil” empire is still an empire.'

MailOnline has contacted Google for a response to Assange's claims. 

The publication comes as he awaits a decision tomorrow from Swedish prosecutors over whether the international arrest warrant against him will be dropped.

Assange has been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, England, since 2012 after he claimed asylum to avoid being taken to Sweden, where police want to question him over alleged sexual molestation and rape.

He claims the accusations are a trumped-up attempt to get him into a position where he can be extradited to the United States to face trial over leaking Government documents - though he has never been charged.
