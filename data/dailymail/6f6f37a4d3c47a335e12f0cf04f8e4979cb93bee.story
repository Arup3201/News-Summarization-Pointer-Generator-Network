Chilling CCTV footage has emerged of a Chinese man armed with a cleaver going on the rampage at a primary school in central China on Tuesday, attacking first and second-graders and leaving eight children injured.

The man has been identified as 35-year-old Chen Zuihang. He was detained following the attack at the school in Macheng, in Hubei province.

The city's government said on its website that police were investigating the motive. The statement said the injured students were being treated at a hospital.

China has suffered a series of attacks on kindergartens and grade schools, often by people who are mentally ill or are angry at society.

Last month, a group of eight knife-wielding men slashed at students on their way home, killing one student and injuring two in the northwestern city of Ankang.

Last year, a man injured six pupils and one parent with a kitchen cleaver in the southern city of Maoming.

Education officials have ordered tighter security at schools throughout the country.

Pictures of Tuesday's Macheng city 
school attack came as news unfolded of a man stabbing seven people to 
death in a village in a central province.

The
 China News Service said the attack occurred at 4 a.m. Wednesday in the 
county of Lushan in Henan province. It says the attacker was captured.

The report says the attack was prompted by disputes with neighbors but gave no details.

China's
 countryside is rife with disputes over land, business dealings and 
other issues. Attacks involving knives, rat poison and other weapons are
 reported regularly.
