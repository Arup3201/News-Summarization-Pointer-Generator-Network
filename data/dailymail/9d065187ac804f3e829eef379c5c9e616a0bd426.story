British No. 2 Dan Evans wants Aljaz Bedene’s bid to play for Great Britain in the Davis Cup blocked because he is already ‘capped’ for Slovenia.

Bedene, ranked 132 in the world, has lived in Britain since 2008 but represented Slovenia in three previous ties.

Evans, ranked 139, said: ‘He’s played Davis Cup for a different country so I just don’t think it would be right if he played Davis Cup for our country. It’s like in football, he’s already been capped for another country.

‘But I’d say I’m a better player anyway so it shouldn’t be a selection issue.’

Evans crashed out of Queen’s in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3, to Kevin Anderson. The South African was too strong and brutally accurate, breaking Evans in his first service game and dominating him thereafter, serving 10 aces, compared to just two from the Briton.

‘I just didn’t get chance to play,’ said Evans. He lasted just 65 minutes against Anderson and fellow Briton James Ward lasted only two minutes longer as he fell to Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, who was cheered to a 7-5, 6-3 victory by his girlfriend Maria Sharapova.

British interest now lies with Murray and if his new coach Amelie Mauresmo needs any extra incentive to help him win Queen’s and defend his Wimbledon title, the comments of Australian Marinko Matosevic should do it.

‘For me, I couldn’t (have a female coach) since I don’t think that highly of the women’s game,’ he said.

‘But it’s all equal rights these days. Got to be politically correct.

‘So, yeah, someone’s got to give it a go but it won’t be me.’
