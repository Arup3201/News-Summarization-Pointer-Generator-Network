Mexico City is sponsoring a program offering cash, toys and computer equipment in exchange for guns in a rough neighborhood where a 10-year-old boy was killed by a stray bullet as he sat inside a movie theater.Â 

The program in the borough of Iztapalapa is dubbed 'For Your Family: Voluntary Disarmament.'Borough president Jesus Valencia wrote in his Twitter account Monday that residents had turned in 27 rifles and 65 pistols.

The borough has been plagued by violent crime and people firing guns into the air during concerts and celebrations.

In November, 10-year-old Hendrik Cuacuas was hit in the head by a 9-mm bullet during a visit to a cinema in the city.

The shooting happened during a screening of the animated Disney movie "Wreck-It Ralph" in the crime-infested Iztapalapa borough.

Investigators at first believed the shot had come from inside the theater, even though the boy's father and the cinema chain Cinepolis said that nobody had heard a gunshot or seen any muzzle flash.

Authorities say 27 rifles and 65 pistols have already been turned in as part of the scheme

The boy's father, Enrique Cuacuas, told local radio after the incident that he felt something 'whiz' by his ear and then saw his son Hendrick convulsing around 15 minutes after the movie started.

But the prosecutor's office said that two holes were discovered in the theater's ceiling along with a 9mm slug on the floor, the same caliber as the bullet found in the boy's head.

Drug and gang related violence is a problem across Mexico, with the country's drug trade being responsible for over 12,000 murders in 2011 alone.
