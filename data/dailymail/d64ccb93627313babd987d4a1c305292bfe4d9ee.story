Embarrassed: Leon Quarless, 45, admitted he had been drinking before boarding the flight from Palma to Blackpool

A drunk businessman started handing passengers €50 notes during a flight before breaking up a mobile phone Sim card and eating it.

Leon Quarless, who had been drinking before boarding the flight from  Palma to  Blackpool, also dished out sterling from a bag containing thousands in both currencies.

But when people refused to accept the notes, the 45-year-old from Formby, Liverpool, started shouting and swearing.

Rebecca Grant was one of the cabin crew on the flight from Palma to  Blackpool on June 24.

She noticed that Quarless was 
sweating and had a large bag of money on his lap tray, containing what 
appeared to be thousands of notes, prosecutor, Tracy Yates, said.

Quarless, who runs a vending machine 
business, then started trying to give the money away to passengers. He offered money to Ms Grant but she told him she could not accept it.

He then lost his temper and started shouting and swearing in full view of other passengers, including a young couple with children.

Cabin crew alerted the pilot who radioed ahead to police. Quarless was arrested and escorted from the aircraft when it landed.

Once in the departure lounge Quarless then broke up a Sim card and ate it.

Windfall: Quarless had tried to give his fellow passengers ¿50 bank notes during the flight. He also dished out sterling from a bag full of cash

Richard Hughes, defending, said his client had gone to meet a large group of friends for a weekend in Palma.

He was carrying the kitty of money, which belonged to the group, when he got a phone call telling him a close friend had been taken seriously ill.

Quarless then got on the first plane back home.

Mr Hughes added: 'He had been drinking as he did not intend to be flying that day. He regrets his behaviour and is embarrassed. The money he had was seized by the police.'

Quarless pleaded guilty to being drunk on the Boeing 737 on a flight. He was fined £320 with £85 costs and ordered to pay the £15 victims’ surcharge by Blackpool magistrates.

Presiding magistrate, Andrew Myers, 
told Quarless: 'Your behaviour was nothing short of disgraceful. You 
will now be passing some of your money to the court rather than giving 
it away in planes.'
