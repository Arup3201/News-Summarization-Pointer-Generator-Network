A mother-of-one who piled on the pounds during pregnancy because she couldn't resist her cravings for snacks has lost three stone in just 12 weeks thanks to overhauling her diet and exercising.

Sarah Harris, 27, from Paignton, Devon, was carrying a stone-and-a-half of extra weight after the birth of her daughter Lucie.

Terrified to return to her former job as a gym instructor, Sarah started a one-woman campaign to fight the flab and went down from 13st 2lb to 9st 12st in three months.

Fat fighter: Sarah managed to drop from 13st 2lb (left) to 9st 12st (right) in three months on her strict regime 

During her pregnancy, Sarah took cravings to the extreme.

She ate at bizarre times, sometimes surviving only on cereal until 11pm at night.

At the time, she was working as a teacher and would have a hot chocolate and a piece of cake in every break, as well as munching her way through three boxes of Rice Krispies a week. 

Sarah said: 'During my pregnancy and afterwards I was used to reaching for snacks all the time and I had some of the weirdest cravings of any of my friends.

'My husband, Paul, couldn't believe it when I would come back from the supermarket with another three boxes of cereal.

'Even after Lucie was born, I missed meals because of my daughter's sleeping habits and just ate what I could when I had a spare moment.'

She added: 'After I had my Lucie I thought it would just fall away but I found myself much bigger than I'd ever been before.

'I couldn't believe I was still so heavy after I gave birth, my daughter was only 6lb 9oz!' 

Sarah had once worked as a gym instructor so was used to being in shape. After becoming a mother, she wanted to return to her first profession rather than teaching but she felt she couldn't be a gym instructor again unless she practised what she preached.

Expecting: Sarah's weight gain began during pregnancy, where intense cravings saw her eating stodgy foods

Pumping iron: Sarah began heading to the gym three times a week in the morning and evening

Work out: As well as cardio Sarah embarked on an intensive weights regime for a hour three times a week  

Sarah now has regained her confidence enough to go back to working as a gym instructor 

So she committed to a radical body transformation programme co-ordinated by Ultimate Sports Nutrition. 

She ditched the sugary snacks and cereal for a protein-heavy diet with lots of vegetables. She also began heading to the gym three times a week in the morning and evening.

To fit in the exercise as a new mother, she often did a 4.30am cardio workout and an hour in the evening pumping iron.

Her hard work paid off and after 12 weeks Sarah had lost 3st 4lb.

She was so pleased with her body transformation, that despite being intimidated to even enter a gym after she gave birth, she has had the confidence to return to work as a gym instructor.

'It feels so great to be back in shape and to have got here so quickly,' she said. 'I'm so glad I did the challenge. Even though it was sometimes hard getting up so early and motivating myself to get the gym, the reward is when I look in the mirror and know that I can be a fit and healthy mum for my daughter.'
