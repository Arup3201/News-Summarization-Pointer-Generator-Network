Ciaran Sweeney went missing from his home on the Oak Tree estate in Mansfield on 14 September

Police searching for a missing 14-year-old boy have recovered the body of a teenager from a quarry.

Bear Grylls fan Ciaran Sweeney went missing from his home on the Oak Tree estate in Mansfield on 14 September following an argument with his mother.

There have been several unconfirmed sightings of the Samworth Church Academy schoolboy since his disappearance but today police discovered the body of a teenage boy in Ratcher Hill quarry in Southwell Road, Mansfield.

Nottinghamshire Police said formal identification is yet to take place to confirm whether the body is that of the missing schoolboy.

A force spokesman said they were investigating the circumstances surrounding the death and a post-mortem examination was expected to be carried out in due course.

Ciaran’s family have been informed of the developments.

At the weekend, police were continuing to search the area around Ciaran's family home.

Officers appealed to anyone who might be giving the missing schoolboy, who is 5ft 2in tall and brown hair, help or shelter to come forward.

Staff at Samworth Church Academy have described Ciaran as a 'pleasant, academically bright, hardworking student'.

In a statement released last week, vice-principal Viv Preece said: 'Ciaran has been with the Samworth Church Academy since 2010 and he has maintained 100% attendance since his time here.

'He is an extremely pleasant, academically bright, hard-working student.

'Ciaran has excelled outside of the 
classroom in playing rugby and outdoor pursuits. He is a keen and 
adventurous young man who would like to follow in Bear Grylls’ 
footsteps.

'We are all worried and miss him very much and we are praying for his safe return.'
