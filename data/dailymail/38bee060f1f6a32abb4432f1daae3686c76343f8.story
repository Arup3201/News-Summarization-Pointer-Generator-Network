It may not have the machine-guns or front-mounted cannons of the original but this Batman enthusiast’s homemade Batpod will still make many fans jealous.   

Tùng Lâm earned the nickname the ‘Vietnamese Dark Knight’ after building his impressive scrap-heap Batman motorcycle in Vietnam’s Lang Son province.

A month ago he posted a video onto YouTube of the prototype which clocked up 370,000 views in just ten days, and now the bike is finally finished.

It has received criticism online for not being similar enough to the original Batpod, and many commentators have pointed out issues with the steering.

But the overall reactions have been those of awe and applause with many jealous Batman fans wanting their own.

Mechanic Tùng Lâm built the Batpod from scrap parts at his car shop and intends to use it as an advertisement, displaying it in the garage.

The scrap-metal was attached to a modified Suzuki FX 125 he bought for £90 with car tyres replacing the original.

Although he did not originally intend to sell the the Batpod bike, which is worth just over £300, Tùng Lâm said that he is considering selling it to a devoted Dark Knight fan if the price is right.

He plans to invest the profits in his next project – a replica of the Tumbler, Batman’s futuristic car from which the Batpod detaches.

Tùng Lâm admits that his creation would have been better had he had a bigger budget and told the VNExppress, that he hopes to make his Tumbler replica closer to the original.

The young mechanic said his future plans was to build replicas of the futuristic helicopters from the movie Avatar once he has the money for parts.
