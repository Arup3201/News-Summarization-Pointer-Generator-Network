This is the fascinating moment a meteor streaked across the night sky near a tiny American town.

In a case of perfect timing, the brilliant sight was recorded by a police car’s dashboard camera in Hewitt, Texas.

With a bright glow the fast-moving fireball was spotted just after the officer, Cpl Jason Naylor, made a traffic stop.

Mr Naylor shared the 30-second clip after he witnessed the thrilling moment late Saturday night.

Witnesses who reported seeing the meteor over central Texas provided conflicting descriptions of its colour.

Some told local media it was bright yellow while others said it appeared to be blue or green.

The American Meteor Society said it has received over 300 reports about a bright fireball west of San Antonio around 8:45pm local time.

Experts say the meteor weighed around 4,000 pounds and burned five times brighter than a full moon

On its website, the organisation said: ‘Witnesses reported an extremely bright green light that rivalled the brightness of the sun.’

It said the meteor was at least four feet wide, weighed around 4,000 pounds and burned five times brighter than a full moon.

The American Meteor Society said: ‘You might ask how an object so small can create such a bright flash and be seen over such a wide area?

‘The answer is the extreme velocity at which these objects strike the atmosphere. Even the slowest meteors strike the atmosphere at a velocity of 10 miles per second.’
