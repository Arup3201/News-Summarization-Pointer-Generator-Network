The 73-year-old victim of an alleged attempted murder in Honolulu - who was thrown 20 feet after being hit by a car driven by a self-titled professional surfer and model - believes the crime was actually a carjacking that was foiled by a quick-thinking good samaritan.

Elizabeth Conklin is recovering in hospital from multiple injuries after being mowed down on Wednesday as she exited her car in the garage of her Waikiki apartment complex.

Jill Hansen, 30, has been charged with attempted murder in relation to the incident, with police saying she ran into Conklin and would have run into her again, if not for a building worker running over and smashing the back window of Hansen's car with a crowbar, causing her to flee.

Authorities initially believed the attack stemmed from an earlier road rage run-in, however Conklin said there was no such encounter, instead assuming Hansen was trying to steal her car.

'I parked in my normal parking place, and I got out and all of a sudden I woke up in an ambulance,' Conklin told ABC News.

Charged: Jill Hansen, 30, has been charged with attempted murder for allegedly running down an elderly woman with her car in Waikiki

Jill Hansen was arrested on suspicion of intentionally striking a 73-year-old woman in a Wai­kiki parking garage with her car. She has a history of driving problems

In an effort to get Hansen's attention and stop her from hitting the woman again, a bystander used a crowbar to break one of the car's windows

Hansen is alleged to have followed the victim back to her apartment complex in Waikiki, waiting for her to get out of the car and then running her down

'She saw my car, it was the car she wanted, she followed me (and) was going to kill me to get the car.'

Conklin has thanked Chris Khory, the man who stopped Hansen, for saving her life.

Khory told Khon2 that after knocking Conklin down, Hansen got out of her sedan, looked at the victim lying on the ground, got back in the car and reversed, preparing to hit her again.

Khory, who works at the apartment complex on Kalakaua Ave, said he quickly grabbed a nearby crowbar and ran over and smashed Hansen's back window.

Stunned, Hansen got out and fled, leaving behind her car.

Police used it to track her down, arresting Hansen six hours later in the Manoa area, and later charged with attempted murder.

She was remained on $1 million bail.

However, before she was arrested, Hansen posted a picture of a BMW 328 wagon - believed to be the same car as Conklin's - along with a message about how she had turned professional as a surfer.

'I am becoming a professional! I have worked SOOOO hard to get to today. I am so greatful for all the support of the surfers and the ASP (association of surfing professionals),' Hansen posted on May 14, along with the picture of the car.

Conklin was taken to hospital with cuts, bruises and a head injury.

She was hospitalized in serious condition, emergency officials said.

This is not Hansen's first run-in with police.

She has a pending assault case and in a separate case was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation.

According to Insurance News Net, Hansen is known in Honolulu for being a worry on the roads.

A member of the Mau­na­lani Heights Neighborhood Security Watch, who asked not to be identified, said the group alerted its members about Hansen last year after several incidents involving erratic driving and behavior.

'We needed everybody on the lookout for her - that's how scary it was,' the member said.

'All 500 members were eventually brought into the loop of this situation because it was so serious.'

'There were probably over half a dozen people that had been adversely affected by her driving.

'Two people almost run over by her, one person almost had a head-on collision with her.'

Hansen was not arrested in connection with those incidents, the member said.

Bad reputation: Jill Hansen was allegedly known around her neighborhood for her driving record, and not in a good way, sources say

According to court records, Hansen was cited three times for speeding since February, the most recent time on Sunday.

In that incident she was allegedly driving 72 mph in a 35 mph zone in Wahiawa.

She is set to appear in court for that case in June.

She was also ticketed for using a mobile electronic device while driving in July. She received a $147 fine.

In addition, in 2011 she received fines for disregarding a stop sign, driving without a license and driving without insurance.

In 2013 she was fined for driving without headlights.

She has two convictions, one for speeding and the other for driving without a license in 2010, according to the state Criminal Justice Data Center.

Besides her driving offenses, Hansen was arrested April 18 for investigation of third-degree assault. She is scheduled to appear for that case in District Court on Friday.
