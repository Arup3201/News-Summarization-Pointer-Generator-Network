 

Adrift in the Channel, closer to France than England and home to its own language, Guernsey is perhaps one of the most mysterious corners of the British Isles.

Measuring just 24 sq miles, this tiny British outpost, officially French-speaking until 1948, also braved invasion by the Nazis in World War Two.

This year sees the 70th anniversary of the island’s liberation. On May 9, Guernsey will mark the closure of one of the most difficult periods in its recent history.

Adrift in the Channel, closer to France than England, Guernsey combines the best of both nations with its own unique twist

This year sees the Channel Islands celebrate 70 years of the liberation, which took place on May 9, 1945

As visitors flock to witness the cavalcades and celebrations, they will discover a quaint, beautiful island, all rugged cliffs, soft sand beaches and rolling green hills in the interior – a throwback to another time.

But Guernsey doesn’t just look backwards. Among the B&Bs, tea rooms and crab sandwiches served up at windswept coastal spots, there are some exciting new developments.

Checking into the four-star Duke of Richmond Hotel is about as far from quaint as Guernsey gets. You could almost be in New York. 

The Duke of Richmond hotel adds a touch of New York-style elegance to the island's accommodation offerings

Bold prints, luxury textiles and some very quirky chandeliers lend the hotel a somewhat urban edge you wouldn't expect on the island

For the first time ever this year, the Channel Islands will hold its first pan-island Heritage Festival.

Running from April 3 to May 11, it will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the islands’ liberation from the occupying German forces during WWII. 

During the festival there will be special openings of the bunkers, observation towers and even the underground towers used by the occupying forces during the war and visitors will be able to take part in themed walks to learn more about the only part of the UK invaded by Nazi Germany.

Boutique, boisterous and beautiful, this revamped hotel welcomes guests with a sleek monochrome foyer filled with quirky adornments, from a suit of armour to a dramatic black chandelier.

A sumptuous afternoon tea display stands, tempting me to stay in and indulge in cakes and sandwiches from stylish leopard print plates.

For those who want to indulge, you can walk straight into the moody, low-lit bar, where beige and black striped chairs and huge high-backed leopard print seats are scattered around glass tables and cocktails are the order of the day.

Upstairs, the rooms are just as quirky, but with a little less leopard print.

Beiges, reds, dark greens and blues are the themes of the rooms, with striped wallpaper, patterned carpets and big cushioned beds. 

They are opulent retreats, with chandeliers, artfully-designed mirrors and sleek bathrooms – exactly what you need after a day of fresh air and coastal walks.

Perched on a hill above Saint Peter Port, the hotel sits at the corner of Cambridge Park, where a statue of Victor Hugo watches over the locals.

The writer spent 15 years in exile on the island, 14 of which he lived at the elegant white-washed Hauteville House in the capital, penning his masterpieces.

From leopard to stripes, careful thought has gone into the clashing prints which dominate the communal areas in the hotel

And on warm sunny days, guests can take the plunge in the pool, which feel like it belongs in the Mediterranean more than the Channel

You can visit today and learn more about the genius behind Les Miserables, where ornate rooms decorated in rich reds and golden trim seem to contrast with the simple beauty outside the building. 

But beyond literary greats, the island has plenty more to offer. I am lucky enough to happen upon golden sunshine and warm temperatures, with just a blustery breeze to blow away the cobwebs.

It is the perfect weather to explore the coastline, from sweeping sandy beaches to craggy cliffs and everything in between. You can walk the whole circumference of Guernsey and each year outdoors-lovers take part in hosted Round The Island walks.

Walking along Guernsey's coastline, its tempestuous history as an island much fought-over is hard to ignore thanks to its stark defences that still stand proud looking out to sea

I’m more interested in the Tasty Walks designed by the tourist board to combine interesting routes with great local spots for good food. I eschew pub snacks in favour of a slice of gâche – Guernsey-style fruit bread – to keep me going as I stroll out and around Jerbourg, the southeastern tip of the island.

You can't wander far in Guernsey without stumbling across its war defences. The island suffered during World War Two. It was attacked by air, with the first raid on June 28, 1940 killing 33 islanders and injuring a further 67.

Thankfully, around 4,000 people - mainly children - had been evacuated in the months before the attack.

The German Occupation began two days later, on June 30, and lasted for almost five years later, when the island was finally liberated on May 9. 

Bulky concrete blocks, built as observation points on the tops of cliffs, and bunkers built into the ground, still stand today - a stark reminder of the suffering of islanders. It gives the feeling of Guernsey constantly on the lookout for where the next enemy will come from.

Of course, not all defences are from the Second World War, the island has its fair share of forts, towers and watch-houses dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries, a reminder of Gurnsey's very strategic position in the Channel between old enemies France and Britain. 

But it's not all memories of war. Quaint villages look like they have stepped straight out of story books, church spires stand out against rolling hills and in spring time wildflowers turn the land into a kaleidoscope of different colours.

Drive along the narrow roads and you'll happen upon 'hedge veg' all over the place - old bookshelves or tables set up with local produce and honesty boxes. It certainly beats going to the supermarket.  

And after a day of bright sunshine and crisp temperatures, it seems the perfect time to retreat back to my sumptuous lodgings for a warming meal.

A glorious roast dinner is served up on Sundays at the Duke of Richmond, in a black and white tiled conservatory filled with light and looking over a deep blue pool, which must see a lot of use in the summer months.

The hotel manager, Paul Brady, a charming man who has lived on the island for nearly thirty years, knows everything and everyone you need in Guernsey. 

He pops from table to table as we tuck into our glorious roast, surrounded by families, romantic couples and even a tour group of Americans.

Paul may not have been born in Guernsey but he seems an islander through and through - immensely proud, devastatingly charming, with one foot in the past and bright ideas for the future.
