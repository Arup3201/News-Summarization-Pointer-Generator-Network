'Sexy convict' Jeremy Meeks, meet 'the Hot Cop of the Castro' Chris Kohrs.

The handsome, astonishingly fit Officer Kohrs, with the San Francisco Police Department, has been sending hearts aflutter ever since one of his admirers shared a picture of the photogenic law enforcement official in the line of duty.

The photo that began the 'hot cop' craze was taken by Mark Abramson, who caught a glimpse of Kohrs, a six-year veteran on the force, as he was guarding a construction site in the Castro District.

Armed and ready: Kohr's Internet fame could be traced back to a chance encounter with Castro District resident Mark Abramson, who snapped a photo of the cop as he was guarding a construction site

'He's so amazing looking, but also radiates,' Abramson gushed to NBC Bay Area.

The snapshots of the eye-catching policeman worthy of a magazine cover were shared by other Facebook users until Nathan Tatterson started an appreciation page dedicated to Kohrs.

As of Thursday morning, the fan page boasted more than 14,000 ‘likes,’ and counting.

In photos posted by Kohrs' fans on the page, he is seen flashing his pearly whites over a Sunday breakfast at a diner, posing with a baby and drilling a wall with his shirt off.

‘Chris himself is not on Facebook. So no one had a forum for them to show their appreciation for him,’ Tatterson told the station. ‘So I thought it would be fun to create one. It took five minutes. No big deal. That got the ball rolling.’

Mr Kohrs, 36, has been described as law enforcement’s answer to convicted felon Jeremy Meeks, 30, whose mugshot shared on Facebook last month became a social media phenomenon.

Seal of approval: Kohrs himself asked the operator of the Facebook page to post this photo of him during the Pride parade to show his support for the gay community

Meeks, who is facing a federal gun possession charge, has been signed by a Hollywood agent from behind bars.

Kohrs also has been enjoying his newfound fame, which so far has earned him fawning media coverage in the local press and an offer to appear on Good Morning America.

But the buff cop with movie-star good looks is not just a pretty face: in his years on the force Kohrs came to the aid of a woman who was being mugged and restrained a would-be robber with his bare hands.

Mr Kohrs told the website The Daily Beast that when a man approached him on the street recently asking to take his picture, he thought nothing of it.

When the photo taken by novelist Mark Abramson went viral online, Kohrs remained in the dark about it since he does not have a personal Facebook account.

That is why the 36-year-old was blindsided when one day he arrived at his police precinct only to discover his pictures and articles about the 'hot cop' plastered all over the walls.

'I was never going to live that down,' Kohrs said.

The gay community of the Castro District took notice, especially after famed writer Armistead Maupin, the author of the series Tales of the City, posted a photo of Kohrs on his Facebook page with the caption: 'I finally got to lay eyes on the legendary Hot Cop of Castro Street.'

Before long, the humble officer of the law has become a tourist attraction for members of the LGBT community, who flocked to the Castro in droves hoping to catch a glimpse of his toothpaste-commercial smile, chiseled face and muscular body.

Those who know Kohrs say that no only is he easy on the eyes, but he is also charming and good at his job.

Kohrs now has fans from coast to coast and far beyond, including in France (where he is said to be huge), in Yemen and even in Saudi Arabia.

Residents of the Castro have had a difficult relationship with the police force, punctuated by  instances of violence targeting the gay community in the 80s. Now, they are hoping that Kohrs could help change the negative image of the SFPD.

‘I think that it’s a great story, that we have an officer with a fan base in the Castro,’ said police spokesperson Albie Esparza.

On his part, Chris Kohrs said he is flattered by all the attention.
