The Missouri auditor's spokesperson who killed himself this weekend wrote in his suicide note: 'I'm sorry. I just can't take being unemployed again.'

Spence Jackson, 44, had served as the media director for Tom Schweich, who took his own life in February amid claims he was the target of an in-party bullying campaign.

Following Schweich's death, Jackson had been an outspoken critic of fellow Republicans accused of spreading rumors about him.

Jackson's body was found in his Jefferson City apartment at 7pm on Sunday during a well-being check by police after they received a call from his mother, who had been unable to reach him.

Double tragedy: Spence Jackson, left, was found dead on Sunday - just a month after his boss, Missouri state auditor Tom Schweich, right, took his life amid rumors he was the victim of a bullying campaign

He died of a single self-inflicted bullet wound to the head and was found in his bedroom beside a a .357 Magnum revolver and a spent cartridge, authorities said. 

On Tuesday, Jefferson City Police Captain Doug Schoemaker released Jackson's suicide brief note, which was found on the living room table, at the request of his family.

The note was dated March 27, which coincides with other indications of when he took his life. 

Colleagues told the St Louis Post Dispatch that Jackson failed to come back to work after taking lunch that day.

'This is being handled strictly as a suicide,' Schoemaker said. 'There is no reason, anything at all, to the contrary.'

Also on Tuesday, Jackson's family released a statement thanking people for the 'overwhelming outpouring of love and support we have received'.

'Spence was a loving son, brother, uncle and friend to many,' the statement continued. 'He was a kind, caring and loyal person. Spence was passionate about his career and for the elected officials, candidates and causes he represented.'

They added that they encourage anyone who might need help to seek it.

His death comes weeks after his boss, Tom Schweich, shot himself dead minutes after telling a reporter he wanted to go public with allegations he was being bullied by fellow Republicans. 

Schweich, who launched his Republican gubernatorial campaign in January and was considered a frontrunner, was targeted by state GOP Chairman John Hancock, according to his supporters.

Hancock allegedly told people that Schweich - who was Christian but had Jewish ancestry - was Jewish with the implication that it was a negative attribute in a gubernatorial campaign.

The auditor had expressed angst to friends that he believed he was the victim of 'an anti-Semitic whispering campaign'.

On February 26, he shot himself at his Clayton home just minutes after telling an Associated Press reporter about the tactics.

Schweich, 54, left behind his wife Kathleen and their two young children, Emilie and Thomas. 

At his funeral days later, former U.S. Sen. John Danforth, an Episcopal priest, suggested during his eulogy that Schweich had been driven to kill himself by political bullying.

Some Schweich supporters called on Hancock to resign or for the Republican state committee to remove him. Jackson was among those who had called for Hancock's resignation.

But a week ago, Clayton Police Detective Lt. Don Bass said Schweich left behind no suicide note and that detectives have found no evidence that he was the target of political bullying.

'I think everybody's looking for a rational reason for an irrational act ... but right now we're not finding anything,' Bass said, adding that based on 'the leads and sources that we have heard from, we have not been able to prove that there was a whispering campaign'.

Hancock has also denied the allegation and said that he has received support from the state committee to continue in his role.

After the death of his boss, Jackson continued to work as the auditor's spokesperson.

He had started working as Schweich's media director in May 2011 after holding several key Republican jobs in state government.

In the early 2000s, he was communications director for then-Secretary of State Matt Blunt, and then worked for Blunt's campaign committee in 2004 as Blunt ran for governor.

Loss: 44-year-old Jackson, pictured, had worked with state officials for more than a decade and was remembered by former Secretary of State Matt Blunt as 'hard-working, well-liked and quick-witted'

Following news of Jackson's death, Blunt released a statement about his 'hard-working, well-liked and quick-witted' friend and former colleague. 

'Melanie and I are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Spence Jackson who was a good friend for many years,' it read.

'Spence was a gifted communicator who dedicated his talents in public affairs to public service...He will truly be missed. We mourn his passing and offer our prayers to his family and friends.'

After working for Blunt, Jackson moved to the Missouri Department of Economic Development, where he worked for just over two years.
