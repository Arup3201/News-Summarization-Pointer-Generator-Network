The lieutenant governor of Texas is under fire for a personal phone call he placed to police demanding to know how to get a relative out of jail.

David Dewhurst called the Allen, Texas police department after they arrested his stepsister’s daughter-in-law for shoplifting groceries and made numerous requests, including one particularly noteworthy demand for the cell phone numbers a county judge and sheriff.

While doing his best to avoid asking outright for the release of Ellen Bever, who he called his niece, Dewhurst repeatedly used his full professional title, insisted on speaking to the most senior officer possible, and even asked for the personal phone numbers of a judge and the county sheriff.

Scroll down to hear Dewhurst's call...

What I do? Texas lieutenant governor David Dewhurst is under fire for making an August 3 phone call to police after the arrest of a relative that some say was inappropriate

Thief? Ellen Bevers, here in her August 3 mugshot, was arrested for allegedly stealing $57 worth of groceries at a Texas Kroger

‘I am every year the No. 1 pick of all of the law enforcement agencies within Texas, the No. 1 pick. I’m a supporter of you, and everyone in law enforcement,’ Dewhurst says in a recording of the call released by police. ‘I want you to do whatever is the proper thing.’

The proper thing, it turned out, was for the on-duty Allen police officer to decline to give Dewhurst the cell phone numbers of Collin County officials.

This, despite the lieutenant governor’s repeated requests for the officer full name and for the number of his ‘immediate supervisor.’

Bevers, who is an elementary school teacher, was jailed after a Kroger store accused her of shoplifting $57 worth of groceries on August 3.

A recording of Dewhurst’s call was only made public Wednesday after an official request from NBC DFW.

Dewhurst tells the officer who takes his call, a Sargent Maness, that he’s known Bevers ‘for 30 years of my life’ and maintains the shoplifting charge was a mistake because ‘this lady is 100 percent innocent.’

Sergeant Maness, however, didn’t take Dewhurst’s bait.

Maness told Dewhurst he’d have to post bond at the county jail, where Bevers was set to be transferred at the time of the phone call.

The flummoxed politician did not give up right then, however.

Legal: Allen, Texas police sergeant Jon Felt said nothing illegal was said in the phone call Dewhurst made to his department August 3

Plausible? Dewhurst insisted in the call to Allen police that Bevers simply accidentally forgot to scan $57 worth of groceries at a Kroger self checkout counter

‘If you would explain to me sergeant what I need to do to arrange for getting her out of jail this evening so that you can proceed with whatever you think,’ Dewhurst emphasizes once again, ‘that is proper.’

And, again, Dewhurst was properly informed that he’d just have to post bond like everyone else.

At least one area police officer has come to the aid of the self-proclaimed ‘No. 1 pick of all of the law enforcement agencies within Texas.’

‘There is nothing criminal here,’ Sergeant Jon Felty of the Allen Police Department told NBC DFW. ‘When I listen to this recording, I hear much of what every family member has when they have a relative incarcerated.’

Hold up: Dewhurst's re-election campaign insists he only called out of concern for Brevers but his opponents have pounced and call his actions inappropriate

The lieutenant governor’s campaign also released a statement.

‘David acted as a concerned family member in an attempt to acquire information on how to post bail for his niece while reiterating multiple times in the full conversation that law enforcement follow their normal protocols and procedures,’ said spokesman Travis Considine.

Dewhurst’s opponents disagree.

One primary challenger, state senator from Houston Dan Patrick issued a statement that expressed his disappointment over Dewhurst’s behaviour.

‘The fact that David Dewhurst believes he and his family are above the law is the height of arrogance and recklessness,’ he said. ‘This blatant abuse of power would be stunning coming from any elected official. However, it is particularly disturbing coming from the lieutenant governor of Texas.’
