A shark caught on a fishing line before being horrifically clubbed over the head and killed has been captured on video revealing the brutal reality of what is happening to global shark populations.

As the shark is reeled out of the water its catcher picks up a large bat and repeatedly strikes it with blows across the head until it can be pulled on board and tossed onto a pile of other dead sharks.

The shocking footage is mixed with clips from around the world showing health and beauty and food products made using parts of sharks being sold in markets and stores.

Video released by Eli Martinez and Jason Perryman shows shocking scenes of sharks being clubbed to death

Eli Martinez, editor of Shark Diver Magazine, who shot the video with friend Jason Perryman, has released the footage in an attempt to rally support for the misunderstood creatures.

He said: ‘Sharks are in trouble - global populations are getting devastated commercially.

‘The whole shark conservation focus has been on the shark finning industry which is horrible enough but the reality is there is a huge demand for shark products all over the world.

‘I made this video to 
share the jaws and teeth being sold in tourist shops, their oil and 
cartilage used for pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies, meat sold in 
the local markets and as fertilizers and dog food, their skins sold for 
fashion - the list goes on.

‘We
had all this footage from travels to places like the Baja coast in 
Mexico and South Texas of our run ins with fishermen and after watching 
it all a story started forming in my head.

The future for sharks looks uncertain if the rate they are being harvested fails to slow according to Eli Martinez

‘This
story had to be told - photos just don't really impact the way video 
does. I had to share what was really happening to our shark populations.
If the world doesn't know it's happening then there is nothing to get 
up in arms about.

‘I hope 
people are shocked that this is happening and feel empathy I really do. 
It's hard to care for sharks because they have such a bad reputation.

‘But
the reality is sharks are not the monsters people believe them to be 
they are beautiful and amazing creatures who are highly misunderstood.

‘Most
people don't know we have over 400 species of sharks in our oceans, 
they believe a shark is a shark, and can't really tell one species from 
the other.

Eli Martinez said he finds the footage extremely painful because sharks are not just animals, but friends to him

The sharks are killed for their meat and to make squaline from their oil which is used in cosmetic products

Sharks only give birth every other year so they are unable to breed as fast as they are being slaughtered for trade

‘We need all our sharks as they help 
keep the ocean clean and in balance and every shark has a job in our 
ocean. For example, great whites help control the seal populations, 
tiger sharks help control the turtle populations, hammerheads help 
control the stingray populations and so on.

‘I spend a lot of time swimming with and interacting with sharks so they are more than just animals to me they are friends.

‘For
me it's extremely painful to see what's happening. It makes me feel 
useless because it's happening every day, it's happening right now.

Sharks are killed for their meat, which is often cooked and eaten with fries in Australia

Shark teeth are sold commercially as tourist items and demand for such products fuels the industry of shark killing

‘And unless we change how we feel 
about these animals and do something to help it will continue to happen 
until there are none left to care about.’

American Mr Martinez admits the future for sharks looks uncertain if the rate they are 
being harvested fails to slow - and claims to be certain some species 
will collapse commercially in the near future.

He
added: ‘Sharks just don't breed fast enough to keep up with our 
commercial demands. By nature's design sharks are only giving birth 
every other year and in some species sometimes only two pups.

‘Commercial
fishermen don't take that into consideration when harvesting sharks, 
they have yearly quotas they have to meet, and they will fish for them 
until there is nothing left to fish.

‘Sharks don't have a chance against our technology, our boats and the amount of people targeting them.’

Shark products are sold as souvenirs in tourist areas which increases the demand for shark fishing

However it is not a fight Mr Martinez has given up on yet and insists people can still help save sharks by being more careful in what they buy.

He said: ‘The first thing is to stop buying shark products period. No shark tooth necklaces unless from a prehistoric shark, no shark steaks or imitation crab which is often made from shark.

‘Fish and chips in Australia is often made from shark and people should stay away from makeup that does not use synthetic squaline - real squaline is made from shark oil.

‘There are also bigger shark movements going on in the world that NGO's are out there working on who always need support from the public to make their efforts a reality.’
