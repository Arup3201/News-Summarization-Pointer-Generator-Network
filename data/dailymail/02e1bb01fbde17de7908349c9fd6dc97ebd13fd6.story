Tourism in Ireland has experienced a boost thanks to Hollywood... and Westeros.

While Northern Ireland has been a hot destination for Game of Thrones fans keen to tour key filming locations in recent years, the Republic of Ireland has also experienced a  boost since Kim Kardashian and Kanye West spent their honeymoon in the country in May.

Tourism Minister Paschal Donohoe has revealed that visitors to Ireland from Great Britain have increased by 11.3 per cent, with an extra 178,200 visitors on last year.

A spokesperson for Tourism Ireland tells MailOnline that forecasts indicate that  Ireland will welcome 8.5 million overseas visitors in 2014, an eight per cent increase over 2013.

Travel companies have capitalised on its popularity, with several running regular Game of Thrones tours from Dublin and Belfast. 

Speaking of the hit HBO series, he told TTG Digital: 'When I was in the US recently, I noticed that there were a huge number of Irish companies advertising Game of Thrones tours to US tour operators – there is no doubt that it has helped.

'I’m a big fan of the books myself,' he added, 'and they’ve been a great boost to tourism.' 

More recently, the Republic of Ireland has seen a rise in interest after it emerged that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West spent a quiet few days there  in May.

The couple jetted to Ireland from their wedding in Florence and holed up in luxury properties in County Limerick and County Laois.

During their time there the reality star and rapper stayed at both Ballyfin House near Portlaoise, and Castle Oliver in Ardpatrick.

They were spotted going to local cinemas and pubs, and are also reported to have enjoyed a cycling excursion in Ballyhoura Mountains. 

'It had a natural indirect effect,' Donohoe said of the Hollywood stars' effect on interest in travel to the country from abroad. 

'People looked at Kim and Kanye coming to Ireland and it made them think "if it’s good enough for them, there must be something worth exploring".'

'It also encouraged journalists to want to write about Ireland who might not have done so before.'

Donohoe explained that the rise in visitor numbers have prompted airlines to increase their services to Ireland too. 

'It created a competitive price point for a number of significant airlines to look at more routes into Ireland, and its not just Dublin, but Shannon airport and others as well,' he said. 

'This summer we had 6 per cent more seats flying in and out of Ireland compared with last year, and we’ll have 8 per cent more this winter.'
