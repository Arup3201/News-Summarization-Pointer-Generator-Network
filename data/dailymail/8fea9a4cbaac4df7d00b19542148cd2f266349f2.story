Anne Hidalgo, who until recently was President Francois Hollande's Socialist culture minister

A leading French politician described London as a ‘suburb of Paris’ today as the two cities continued a war of words over which is the most popular in the world.

Anne Hidalgo, who until recently was President Francois Hollande’s Socialist culture minister before running for mayor of the French capital, said there was more crime in the English capital, less entrepreneurial businesses starting up, and fewer foreign visitors.

But she did concede that there was more dog waste on Paris pavements, and that notoriously rude Parisians 'should be kinder'.

UK-based tourist agency Visit Britain claimed London broke the 16-million visitor bar last year, with Paris attracting 15.9 million people.

But in an angry riposte, Paris city hall put out a statement today saying the figures were utterly misleading.

‘So at this stage Paris remains the top tourist destination in the world,’ said a statement for the city hall.

Ms Hidalgo said: ‘Competition between the two giant metropolises is all well and good but we have to stick to the truth.

‘The figures show that Paris is still above London as the most visited city in the world’, adding:‘Paris is safer than London, where there is four times as much crime. Paris is also safer than New York if you compare crime data.’

Responding to reports of the masses of Roma gypsy gangs preying on tourists in Paris, Ms Hidalgo said: ‘Yes, there is a lot of talk about tourists in Paris being targeted and we need to deal with that.

‘That’s why we are working with the museums, the police , the transport authorities and the tourist office.

‘There are organized gangs of Eastern European criminals working here. We have to deal with this problem, but they also operate in other cities like Madrid and Brussels.’

Ms Hidalgo, 54, who was speaking to members of the Anglo-American Press Association of Paris, said 'London is in some ways a suburb of Paris'.

She said that there were too many giant retail corporations in London.

‘Shopping streets in Paris work when there’s a variety of different types of shops,’ she said. ‘This is what attracts customers and I will not change this culture just so we can have giant stores opening like in London.’

Bizarrely, she also claimed: ‘Paris has more shops open on a Sunday than London. In London it is all big commercial centres but in Paris there is a network of small independent stores that are open. We want to protect these local stores; this is the identity of Paris. It’s our strength.’

Londoners may not like to hear this, but there may be some truth in Hidalgo's pronouncement about Paris's crime figures being lower than the UK's capital.

At least where assaults are concerned.

According to the Metropolitan Police's website, there were 148,088 acts of violence against a person reported to the police in London in 2013.

Meanwhile, according to the most recent statistics available for Paris, recorded in 2011, there were just 35,000 assaults reported.

They are statistics for different years, but it's not likely Paris's assault rate has changed dramatically in two years.

However, when the population figures are taken into account, the difference narrows significantly.

Paris has a population of 2.2million, meaning there are 16 assaults per 1,000 people. But London has a population of eight million, meaning there are 18 assaults per 1,000 people.

In fact strict Sunday trading laws still exist in Paris, while almost all shops are open in London. And when it came to arguing that Paris was indeed a business-friendly city, Hidalgo again chose to compare it to London.

Ms Hidalgo, who was born in Spain, also said: ‘Paris is ahead of London in terms of the creation of start-ups. We will soon be home to the biggest start-up hub in the world.

‘Yes French people go abroad to live and to work, but they come back, because of the public services that France can offer. Just like the creches, for example. These are services of high quality that cost less than in London.’

Ms Hidalgo did concede, however, that there was more dog mess in Paris, saying: ‘It annoys me too. It’s unacceptable.’

And she said that notoriously rude Parisians could ‘be a little kinder’ to each other in the street so as not to upset tourists.

Visit Britain’s 16 million figure was actually a projection based on visitor numbers for the first nine months of 2012, said Paris city hall.

In contrast, the 15.9 million figure for Paris was for the same period in 2012, with the exact number for 2013 not yet finalised.

In fact, say the Parisians, there were 29 million visitors to Paris in the whole of 2012, and 27.6 million to London.

As the war of words threatened to turn into a full scale diplomatic dispute, the British pointed to recent reports which highlighted how Paris was falling behind the times.

A survey in 2013 revealed how London had stolen the ‘World’s Best City’ title from Paris, with the authors describing how ‘It should be a warning sign to all stakeholders of Paris.’

The office of London Mayor put the city’s success in attracting millions of visitors in 2013 down to the ‘Olympic effect’ following the  2012 games.

‘The image of London has changed because of the Olympics,’ said Kit Malthouse, deputy mayor.

‘People saw a beautiful city, open and vibrant and not just the usual cliches about Beefeaters and the Queen.’
