It used to only come between two sesame buns and surrounded by the ubiquitous McDonald's beef patty - but now Big Mac sauce is available in bottle for the first time.

However, so far only one 16oz container of the sauce has been put on sale - and it'll set the buyer back at least $18,000.

The fast food giant made the decision to release the sauce outside of a Big Mac order to raise funds for its charity arm in Australia.

Saucy: An online auction of the chain's first sale-able bottle of Big Mac sauce have attracted bids of 23,000 Australian dollars, or $18,000

'Improves everything': An eBay listing for the sauce suggests it is the ultimate condiment

Australia only: The sauce, which McDonald's said lots of people have asked about, will also be available to high online bidders

Bidders in the country have piled in on an eBay listing to get the chance to use the sauce themselves, buoyed by claims it can improve any dish - even cupcakes.

Offers for the bottle - set to be one of 200 - have exceeded 23,000 Australian dollars, or $18,000.

The eBay listing touts the exclusivity of the product, and says it will overshadow all other condiments.

It says: 'This bottle is #1 of only 200 being produced worldwide, and they won’t be sold in restaurants. That makes it rarer than a spot on Bondi beach on New Years Day.

'So slide the mustard, mayo and tomato sauce to the back of the fridge – because everything tastes better when it tastes like the Big Mac.' 

The proceeds of the sale will go to Ronald McDonald House Charities, which help ill children and their families.

Less wealthy Australians will also be able to get their hands on the sauce. Each of the country's 920 outlets have been given 600 small tubs of the sauce, weighing in at just under an ounce each.

The contents of Big Mac sauce have long been touted as a secret. But in 2012, the chain's executive chef in Canada made a video showing people how to whip up their own.

According to the clip, which has 4million views on YouTube, the ingredients are mayonnaise, sweet pickle relish, yellow mustard, white wine vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika.

The auction comes as McDonald's has been struggling with sliding profits in recent months.

Changing tastes - which see the likes of Chipotle and Shake Shack surge in popularity - have hit the retailer's customer base. Food safety scares in Asia have also harmed the bottom line.

Since the slump, McDonald's has responded with a number of feel-good initiatives, such as this charity push.

In the United States, the chain is offering some customers free food if they smile, dance or hug at the checkout during February, a promotion it announced in its Super Bowl ad.
