A musician shot and killed two members of an Iranian indie rock band and another musician early on Monday before turning the gun on himself, police said.

Two of the dead were brothers and members of the group the Yellow Dogs, 
who came to the U.S. from Iran three years ago after appearing in a film
 about the underground music scene there, according to band manger Ali 
Salehezadeh.

Another person killed was also a musician but wasn't in the
 band. A fourth person, an artist, was shot and wounded and is currently in hospital in critical condition.

Accused: Sources identified the gunman in the early Monday killing spree in Brooklyn as Raefe Ahkbar - who turned the gun on himself after shooting three dead

Investigation: Crime scene personnel work at the Brooklyn home where four people were shot and killed last night in a triple murder suicide

Group: Neighbors said the men were part of a Iranian band called 'Yellow Dogs' who were formed in Tehran in 2006 but called Brooklyn home

Day after: Police officers and crime scene personnel work on the roof of the building where the gunman was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head

The shooter was a member of another band from Iran, the Free Keys, who 
knew the victims but hadn't spoken to them in months because of a 'petty
 conflict', Salehezadeh said.

Police named him today as Raefe Ahkbar.

He angrily confronted one of the band mates before the shootings, sources said.

'He said something like "Why did you bring me over here [from Iran] and then throw me out?"' a source told the New York Post.

He allegedly shot the band’s 27-year-old guitarist, Soroush Farazmand, in a second-floor bedroom and then climbed to the third floor where he killed singer Ali Eskandarian, 35, and drummer Arash Farazmand.

He also shot Sasan Sadeghpourosko, 22, twice in the arm outside the building. He was not believed to be in the band.

Police say a musician who shot and killed three other Iranian men inside a New York City apartment before committing suicide was upset because he had been kicked out of an indie rock band

The band’s Facebook page identifies other members as guitarist Siavash Karampour and bassist Koory Mirz, who were not injured.

Commissioner Raymond Kelly said 
it appeared to be a dispute over money, but police were investigating 
the motive as well as the relationships between the victims and the 
shooter.

The four victims lived in a row house in East Williamsburg, an 
industrial neighborhood home to mostly warehouses where artists can rent
 cheaper space than in trendier parts of the city.

The shooting happened shortly after midnight. Kelly said the gunman 
opened fire with a Century Sporter .308-calibery semi-automatic weapon through a window, then went inside and continued firing.

He was then found on the roof with a self-inflicted shot to the head,
 police said.

An assault-style rifle was found next to the body. Kelly 
said it had been purchased in upstate New York in 2006 and police were 
investigating its history.

The Yellow Dogs played recent gigs in New York at indie rock venues like
 the Knitting Factory and Brooklyn Bowl, and their dance music sound is a
 little like Joy Division.

Originally from Tehran, they were the subject
 of a 2009 film, No One Knows about Persian Cats, which told the 
semi-fictional tale of a band that played illegal rock shows in Tehran.

Photographer Danny Krug said they were nice guys who held down day jobs and played music at night.

'Originally they were from Iran, and they just wanted to play rock 
music,' said Krug, 24, who lives in Brooklyn. 'And you can't do that 
there, so they managed to make their way over here.'

The band often threw parties at their apartment, Krug said.

Martin Greenman, 63, works around the corner from the shootings and said
 he would see the band members coming and going with their instruments.

'They seemed really nice, not violent or anything, just your typical 
guys,' he said. 'They never caused any trouble. I see them almost every 
day, it's really a shock.' 

The members of the Yellow Dogs are Koory Mirz, Arash Farazmand, Siavash Karampour and Soroush Farazmand.

In February, The Yellow 
Dogs told Now This News that they left Iran on an artist visa and then 
received political asylum from the U.S. government. They believed that 
if they returned to Iran they might be killed.

A neighbor, known only as Frank, told the NY Post that he had been disturbed by a number of parties at the building recently.

He said: 'During the summer, it was ongoing, really loud parties with the street blocked off by (illegal) cabs. It was the usual hipster rave scene.'

Police say officers didn't fire their weapons and reports of sniper fire on them are incorrect.
