If Maria Sharapova is feeling any pressure from being the title favourite at the French Open then Paula Ormaechea can attest that she is not showing it.

As soon as Serena Williams was cleared from her path by Garbine Muguruza, Sharapova was tipped as the player to beat.

The 2012 champion and 2013 finalist has transformed herself into the second best player in the world on clay and needed just 51 minutes to thump Ormaechea 6-0 6-0 in the third round.

It all looked so different when Ormaechea forced Sharapova to save three break points in a nine-minute opening game that was played either side of a short rain break.

But after missing those chances, it all went away from the Argentinian very quickly as Sharapova found her groove.

The Russian is an utterly ruthless competitor and barely allowed her opponent a sniff of another game to set up a fourth-round clash with 2010 finalist Sam Stosur.

The Australian knocked out ninth seed Dominika Cibulkova and could be a threat to Sharapova, but the seventh seed has won 13 of her previous 15 meetings with Stosur, including all three on clay.
