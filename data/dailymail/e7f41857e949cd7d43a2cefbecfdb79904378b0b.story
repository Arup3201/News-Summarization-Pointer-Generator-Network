It may just sound like baby talk, but mothers who hold a ‘conversation’ with their infants are actually teaching them to speak more quickly.

Researchers found new mothers who respond enthusiastically to their baby’s babbling are helping to speed up the child’s language development

They say parental feedback is a vital process that enables mothers and babies to become mutually engaged in ‘talking’.

It enhances the ability of children to communicate – unlike cases where mums did not respond attentively.

A new study, by US academics at the University of Iowa (UI) and Indiana University, serves as evidence that speaking to infants at a very early age is vital for their development.

The authors say parents who babble back at their newborns – even if they don’t understand what they’re trying to say – are a key part of the process.

The findings challenge the belief that human communication is innate and cannot be influenced by parental feedback.

Instead, the researchers argue that parents who consciously engage with their babbling infants can accelerate their children’s vocalising and language learning.

Senior study author Julie Gros-Louis, assistant professor of psychology at the UI, said ‘It’s not that we found responsiveness matters.

‘It’s how a mother responds that matter.’

Researchers observed the interactions between 12 mothers and their eight-month-old infants during free play twice a month for 30 minutes over a six-month period.

They noted how the mothers responded to their child’s positive vocalisations, such as babbling and cooing, especially when it was directed toward the mother.

Current research in Dr Gros-Louis’s lab has found similar levels of responsiveness of mothers and fathers to infants’ babbling.

Researchers discovered that infants whose mothers responded to what they thought their babies were saying showed an increase in more complex sounds, with consonant-vowel vocalisations.

They say the babbling has become sophisticated enough to sound more like words to the mother.

The babies also began directing more of their babbling over time toward their mothers.

However, infants whose mothers did not try as much to understand them and instead directed their infants’ attention at times to something else did not show the same rate of growth in their language and communication skills.

The findings are published in the latest edition of the journal Infancy.

Dr Gros-Louis says the difference was mothers who engaged with their infants when they babbled let their children know they could communicate.

Consequently, those babies turned more often to their mothers and babbled.

She said ‘The infants were using vocalisations in a communicative way, in a sense, because they learned they are communicative.’

In a survey a month after the study ended, mothers who were most attentive to their infants’ babbling reported their children produced more words and gestures at the age of 15 months.

Last month a study from American researchers showed that exposing infants to clear vocal sounds from birth helps them distinguish language from other noises.

They found that babies aged seven months can differentiate voices from other sounds - even when they cannot see the person speaking.

By the age of 11 months, before they can speak themselves, the children have already learned to differentiate their mother tongue from other languages, the scientists discovered.
