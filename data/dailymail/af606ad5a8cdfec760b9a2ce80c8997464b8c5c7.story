Steve Jobs personally blocked the release of iPhone 5 - a remodel of the phone with a larger screen.

But his successors at the company have wasted no time in moving ahead.

Japanese fan site Macotakara has reported that Sony and Hitachi are making four-inch screens - and have already shipped early prototypes to Apple's Cupertino HQ.That hints at a release as early as March.

Apple Computer headquarters in Cupertino, California: Fan sites report that prototype four-inch screens have already shipped to Apple's headquarters for testing - hinting at a spring launch

The late Apple CEO, Steve Jobs - here pictured in 1982 - blocked release of iPhone 5, as he felt that the handset was not finished. His successors obviously feel differently

The conservative lines of iPhone 4S - 
basically a remodel of the previous year's iPhone 4 - will be radically 
redrawn for next year's iPhone 5.

Website
 iLounge has spoken to sources within Apple who say that the late CEO's 
Steve Jobs refusal to upgrade to a bigger screen is going to be the 
first thing to go - the new iPhone 5 will have a four-inch screen, 
putting it on a par with many Android rivals.

Our most reliable source has spoken: expect body changes for the next iPhone,' said the site.

'Our
 source says that the next-generation iPhone will not look like 
the teardrop-shaped version that was widely rumored for release in 
2011,' said iLounge - often a reliable source of early information on 
Apple prodcuts.

'Weâ€™ve been told that the device will have a 4-inch display and will be 
8mm longer than before, with a metal casing (probably aluminum).

Steve Jobs, Apple Chief Executive: Jobs opposed radical changes for this year's iPhone model - but next year's iPhone 5 will have the four-inch screen he turned down for this year's 4S

Demand: Despite rumours that a new iPhone 5 would be launched, the iPhone 4S still proved extremely popular with people looking to purchase it in Covent Garden last month

The new version, iLounge says, is being built to cope with the increased battery drain of an LTE aerial - ie 4G.

In
 Britain, there is still no 4G network - offering far faster data 
transmission than the current 3G network - but there may be networks in 
place by the time Apple's handset launches next summer.
