Maybe the government should start thinking about bringing back the baby bonus after figures have revealed that the birth rate in Australia has continued to fall. 

The Australian Bureau of Statistics has found that the country's birth rate has reached its lowest point since 2006.

But the good news is for older mums, who are bucking the trend, with fertility rates increasing for those aged 40-44 years between 2012 and 2013.

Australia's birth rates continue to fall and it has reached the lowest point since 2006

The fall in births, along with an increase in the number of women aged 15 to 49 years - contributed to Australia's total fertility rate falling from in 2013 but older mothers bucked the trend with fertility rates increasing in those aged 40-44

The number of baby girls born in Australia in 2013 was down more than 1,200 compared to 2012

'We saw a total of 308,100 births in 2013, which is down on the 309,600 from the previous year,' said Denise Carlton from the ABS.

                           2012          2013         (+-)

Australia           309,582    308,065    - 1,517

NSW                 98,508      100,462    +1,954

VIC                    77,405       73,969      - 3,436

QLD                  63,837       63,354       -483

WA                   33,627       34,516      +889 

SA                     20,433      20,090       -343

TAS                    6,168        6,049         -119

ACT                  5,461         5,545         +84

NT                     4,104        4,053         -51 

'This fall in births - along with an increase in the number of women aged 15 to 49 years - contributed to Australia's total fertility rate falling from 1.93 in 2012 to 1.88 in 2013.'

'But the trend among older mothers - those aged between 40 and 44 years - was reversed, and their fertility rate has continued to increase since its lowest point in the mid-1970s.'

'Over the past 30 years, fertility rates for these older mums have nearly tripled, and today's results see the trend continuing', said Ms Carlton.

Breaking it down by gender, the number of baby girls born in Australia in 2013 was down more than 1,200 compared to 2012.

But the number of baby boys didn't differ too much from the previous year, only 282 births down in 2013.

There was a total of 308,100 births in 2013, which is down on the 309,600 from the previous year (1,517 less babies born)

Despite a fall in the birth rate, aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander woman actually recorded 73 more births in 2013 than 2012 although their fertility rate decreased

The national average for the media age of mothers increased only slightly from 30.7 in 2012 to 30.8 in 2013

Across the states, New South Wales had the most number of babies born at more than 100,000, followed by Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia.

Only three states recorded an increase in the birth rate which were New South Wales, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.

                                      2012            2013

Total Fertility rate          1.93            1.882

Median age of mother   30.7            30.8

Median age of father     33               33 

The Northern Territory had the least number of births at 4053. 

And the figures have also shown Australia had its fair share of twins, with 4,475 twins being born in 2013 and 75 recorded triplets or more. 

The national average for the media age of mothers increased only slightly from 30.7 in 2012 to 30.8 in 2013.

The median age of first-time mothers in 2013 was 29.3 years, 63% of whom were married at the time of giving birth. 

The ACT recorded the oldest median ages of mothers and fathers (31.6 years and 33.8 years respectively), while the NT had the youngest mothers and fathers (29.0 years and 31.6 years respectively).

The fertility rate across Australia dropped from 1.93 babies per woman in 2012 to 1.882 in 2013

The total fertility rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers also decreased to 2.34 in 2013, the lowest rate since 2006

The fertility rate across Australia dropped from 1.93 babies per woman in 2012 to 1.882 in 2013.
