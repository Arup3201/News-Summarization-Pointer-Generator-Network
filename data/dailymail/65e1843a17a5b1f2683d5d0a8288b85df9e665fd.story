An online retailer has sparked fury by selling T-shirts of Jimmy Savile with jokey slogans about child abuse.

The items of clothing, on sale for between £15 and £22, show the grinning face of the notorious paedophile next to deeply offensive messages.

The shirts were discovered for sale via on-line community and marketplace Redbubble, together with children’s clothing where they are classed as ‘art’.

Child abuse campaigners have called on Redbubble  to immediately remove them.

'It’s truly disgusting that any human being could stoop that low and make money not only off him, but off his victims,' said Pauline Carruthers, who runs the Hope charity for victims of sexual abuse.

'They should stop selling them. They have a duty to the public, and if someone who has been abused sees this, it could have a devastating impact.'

Miss Carruthers’s charity, based in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, where the DJ had one of his homes was inundated with more than 400 calls for help in the aftermath of the Savile revelations.

However, almost two years later, they are still struggling to secure the funding they need to help the victims.

She added: 'What really makes me mad is that here we are, struggling for money to help his victims, and we have sick people cashing in on him.

'But these people selling them are just unbelievable, there’s no other word for them.'
