A derelict police station which used to house scores of police officers and dozens of prisoners is expected to fetch up to £1.5million after going up for sale.

The three-storey building used to serve as the main police station for Poole, Dorset, until 2009 when the force moved to a state-of-the-art HQ nearby.

The 1930s building, that sits on a 0.89 of an acre site, has lain mostly empty since then, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of pounds a year to the taxpayer.

It has now gone on the market with interested parties invited to make sealed bids.

The property includes the large L-shaped police station that has a front desk, offices, cafeteria and social club.

There is also a separate custody suite with 18 cells, interview rooms, an enclosed exercise yard for prisoners and a car park.

For sale: The derelict building, which used to serve as the main police station for Poole, Dorset, until 2009 when the force moved to a new HQ nearby, has gone up for sale

On the market: The 1930s building, that sits on a 0.89 of an acre site, has lain mostly empty since 2009, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of pounds a year to the taxpayer

Valuation: Interested parties have been invited to make sealed bids for the property now on the market. Valuer Ed Impey can be seem measuring up the reception area

Change of use: It is likely a developer will snap up the unusual property and either convert it into office space or flats. There has even been interest in transforming the station into a care home. But because it sits in the middle of a conservation area any plans for its future use will be heavily scrutinised

Facilities: Estate agent Ed Impey said: 'This is a rare opportunity to buy an unusual property that has a lot of potential'. Pictured is the exercise yard for the prisoners (left) and graffiti on a cell door (right)

Interest: Mr Impey said his firm had seen 'a lot of interest from both commercial and residential developers'. Pictured is the alarm on the outside of the building

Previous use: Mr Impey, of estate agents Savills, said it would be 'quite easy and straight forward to turn it into offices'. He suggested it could house 15 flats

Marks left behind: The building used to house scores of police officers as well as dozens of prisoners. Pictured are marks made by plastic bullets on the reception glass

Position: The police station is situated on Sandbanks Road and overlooks picturesque Poole Park. Pictured is the police bar on the top floor

Covenant: There is also an old covenant in place which means the building can only be used as an office building or a police station

Development: Mr Impey warned that if a residential developer bought the building 'they would have to pay the local council to get the covenant removed'

Inspection: The building is thought to be worth between £1-1.5million. Valuer Ed Impey can be seen inspecting one of the corridors of the station

Features: The property includes the large L-shaped police station that has a front desk, offices and
cafeteria, along with the separate custody suite

Valuation: The property has now gone on the market with interested parties invited to make sealed bids. Mr Impey is pictured in one of the cells
