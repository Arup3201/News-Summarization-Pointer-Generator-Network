Ed Miliband will launch a campaign today to compel the Government to deal only with firms willing to pay a ‘living’ wage.

He will insist Whitehall contracts should only be offered to companies paying at least £7.20 an hour, or £8.30 in London, both far above the legal minimum wage.

The Labour leader will mark Living Wage Week by saying it is an idea ‘whose time has come’.

'Key plank': Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, who has worked closely with his brother David, right, on the plans, has said making the living wage the norm for workers is at the heart of his party's bid to return to power

But Government lawyers warn awarding contracts on the basis of hourly wage rates may be illegal.

The legal opinion was based on a 
European Courts of Justice case which found that describing a wage in a 
particular contract could be illegal unless it was universally applied 
across the country.

The opposition leader has been 
working closely with his brother David Miliband on ways to ensure the 
pay terms replace the lower minimum wage as the norm - possibly through 
naming and shaming companies that do not pay it.

Their
collaboration is a sign that tensions between the Milibands are thawing
after Ed Miliband narrowly beat his brother to the Labour leadership in
2010.

'Slog': Ed Miliband has said workers deserve a decent wage if their employers can afford it

The
leader of the opposition said the wage - defined as the minimum hourly rate needed
for an acceptable standard of living - was a key plank of his 'One 
Nation' vision to share prosperity.

The £7.20 living wage, which 
rises to more than £8.30 in London, is higher than the current minimum 
wage of £6.19 for people aged 21 and over, and £4.98 for those aged 18 
to 20.

While some 
large firms and public sector employers already pay the living wage to 
staff, Labour wants to see more companies adopting the policy 
voluntarily.

As part of its policy review, 
Labour is looking at three ways of making the pay terms the new norm, 
including naming and shaming listed companies who do not pay the wage 
through corporate governance rules.

It is also considering 
introducing rules that will see Whitehall contracts awarded to firms who
pay workers the living wage or above, and giving Treasury-funded 
incentives to companies who introduce the wage structure.

In an 
interview with the Independent on Sunday,  Ed Miliband said: 'You go out,
slog your guts out...you deserve a decent wage if the company can 
afford it.

'We've got a growth crisis in Britain but we've also got a
living standards crisis, because the proceeds of economic growth are 
not being fairly distributed any more.

'It is about giving people a proper stake in the future of the country,' he said.

In an article for the Observer newspaper, his brother David, the former Foreign Secretary, said local authorities and other employers could be offered financial incentives for insisting that private contractors pay the living wage as a condition of being awarded work.

The
Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that for every person moved on 
to the living wage, the Treasury would save around £1,000 from less 
spending on tax credits and from increased tax revenue.

'Tension': Ed Miliband, left, narrowly beat his brother David Miliband, right, to the Labour leadership in 2010

A number of major firms already pay workers and contractors a living wage or higher.

Barclays
has paid the living wage in London since 2007, while 19 local 
authorities have been accredited as 'living wage employers'.

Ed Miliband said the wage was good for businesses because staff turnover was lower.

The
idea of naming companies who do not offer the wage and paying money 
back to employers through Treasury savings was set out last week in a 
report on living standards by the Resolution Foundation.

Gavin Kelly,
the think tank's chief executive, said: 'One in five British workers 
are low paid and it's a major reason why so many lower-income families 
feel as if they're running uphill - working hard but getting almost 
nowhere.

'The high price of low pay is also borne by the taxpayer 
through in-work subsidies - so we all have reason to do something about 
it.

'Requiring listed companies to report how many of their employees
receive less than the living wage would introduce the power of 
transparency to this debate; it would be a vital step and help galvanise
change.'
