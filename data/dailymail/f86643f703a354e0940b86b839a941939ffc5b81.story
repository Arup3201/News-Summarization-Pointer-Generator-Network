A landmark legal ruling banning the tradition of saying prayers at council meetings was denounced last night as an ‘assault on Britain’s Christian heritage’.

The High Court controversially backed an anti-religious campaign to abolish official acts of worship.

Christians and politicians reacted with dismay after a judge overturned centuries of custom by outlawing a town hall in Devon from putting prayers on the formal agenda.

Controversial victory: Former councillor Clive Bone, pictured outside the town council offices in Bideford, won a legal battle to outlaw prayers at meetings - drawing instant criticism from religious groups

It prompted concern that it would 
pave the way for Parliament to abandon prayers before Commons and Lords 
business, mark the end of hospital and Forces chaplains, and could even 
lead to the abolition of the Coronation Oath, pledged by Kings and 
Queens taking the throne.

The ruling means prayers will not be 
allowed at the start of council meetings across England and Wales, 
though they may still be said before the official start.

It comes as two Christian B&B owners who refused to let a gay couple share a room lost an appeal against a ruling they must pay thousands in compensation to the men.

The Court of Appeal told Peter and Hazelmary Bull that they were entitled to express their beliefs, but not if they were incompatible with the rights of gay people.

Atheist former councillor Clive Bone 
started the case against Bideford town council in July 2010, claiming he
 had been ‘disadvantaged and embarrassed’ when religious prayers were 
recited at formal meetings.

Backed by the National Secular 
Society, he insisted that the ‘inappropriate’ practice breached the 
human right to freedom of conscience and discriminated against 
non-believers, making them feel ‘uncomfortable’.

The society claimed council meetings 
should be ‘equally welcoming to everyone in the local community’ and 
should therefore be ‘religiously-neutral’.

Mr Justice Ouseley, sitting in 
London, rejected the human rights and equality challenges. But he ruled 
that formal prayers at council meetings were unlawful because of a 
technicality in the Local Government Act 1972.

He said local authorities had no 
power to ‘say prayers or to have any period of quiet reflection as part 
of the business of the council’. Acknowledging the widespread importance
 of the case, Mr Justice Ouseley gave Bideford council permission to 
appeal.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles described the ruling as ‘very illiberal’.

He said: ‘The ruling is surprising 
and disappointing. Christianity plays an important part in the culture, 
heritage and fabric of our nation.’

He vowed to override the High Court 
ruling by bringing in the Government’s Localism Act, which would give 
councils the power to hold prayers at the start of meetings, as early as
 next Friday.

Simon Calvert, of the Christian 
Institute, said: ‘Prayers have been a part of council meetings for 
centuries, and many people, either for religious reasons or cultural 
reasons, see them as a positive part of our national life.

‘It’s a shame the courts have taken 
sides with those whose goal is to undermine our Christian heritage. It 
is high time Parliament put a stop to this assault upon our national 
heritage.’

Harry Greenway, a former Tory MP and 
ex-chairman of the National Prayer Breakfast, said: ‘If people do not 
want to attend prayers of this nature, they can stay away instead of 
meddling and busybodying with other people’s beliefs.

‘Non-believers are not harassed in 
this way by believers. Why cannot the non-believers show the same kind 
of tolerance?’

Mr Bone, who left Bideford council because of its 
‘refusal to adjust’ its prayers policy, said: ‘I’m delighted. I’m not 
surprised, I expected to win.

‘This has got nothing to do with 
intolerance towards religion. Religious freedom is an absolute right and
 so is freedom from religion an absolute right, in my view.’

Keith Porteous Wood of the National Secular Society said: ‘We’re very pleased with the judgment.’

Officials at Parliament said the 1689
 Bill of Rights meant the  Commons and Lords decided their own business,
 so a legal challenge would fail.
