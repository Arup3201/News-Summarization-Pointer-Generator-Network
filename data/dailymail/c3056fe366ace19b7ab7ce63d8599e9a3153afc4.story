Parents are losing control over what youngsters watch, experts have warned

Parents are losing control over what youngsters watch, experts warned yesterday.

This is because tablets, phones and computers allow their children to see violence and pornography without their knowledge. 

Children as young as 12 are viewing vile and often illegal websites with their friends using the new technology which parents cannot track – although some would argue that parents should be stricter about leaving their children to view content unsupervised.

This has left a generation 
desensitised to the obscene language and sexual images which have become
 the ‘wallpaper’ of children’s lives, said a report for the British 
Board of Film Classification.

Parents
 said they worried about what children aged ten to 15 were now able to 
view using phones, tablets such as iPads and computers -– even though in
 many cases they bought the devices for them.

They also expressed 
concern about the surge in sleepovers, which often have little adult 
supervision and allow children to watch films their parents would not 
approve of.

Children were also seen as desensitised to the sexualisation of young women.

The
 BBFC report said: ‘For many parents, technology is in the hands of the 
young and the balance of power within the household has shifted.’

The Daily Mail has campaigned for an opt-in system of filters.

The scheme, slowly being rolled out by the internet giants, would mean adults would actively have to ask for the household to have access to X-rated websites.

Researchers for the BBFC questioned 10,000 people – including teenagers –  about the viewing habits of young people, for the report to accompany its new guidance on film classification.

The British Board of Film Classification has also announced plans to clamp down on raunchy music videos in the UK.

Videos made featuring artists such as Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Britney Spears could be targeted following the large-scale public consultation.

The body said there are ‘special worries’ about sexual content in music videos.

The vow to crack down on the videos came as the BBFC released a report stating that parents are losing control over what their children watch.

In its report it noted: ‘A specific issue highlighted by the consultation is in relation to sexual content, where the public is particularly concerned about the sexualisation of girls, and pornography.  

‘The content of music videos and the ease of accessibility of online porn are special worries.’

It also said the ‘sexualisation of young girls was of particular concern’.

‘Music videos were identified as a key source of sexual imagery, which parents believed to be potentially harmful to young girls’ emotional wellbeing and social development,’ the report said.

‘The overwhelming reaction to the music videos content was one of shock and incredulity.’

‘Parents are working hard to maintain
 control, yet feel that the tide of information and challenging content 
can sometimes be against them,’ the report said.

‘By
 age 15, most parents argued that it was “game over” and they could no 
longer control their child’s viewing. They were fairly pragmatic about 
the way in which their children were viewing films – online, at friends,
 illegally downloading.’

The fears raised in the report were echoed by Tory MP John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee. 

‘Now so much viewing is done online. All it requires is for the viewer aged 15 to know what the parental lock password is and it’s very easy to get around,’ he said.

‘It is perfectly true that most children over 15 are very familiar and literate with digital distribution online and therefore for parents to control it is much harder.’

The BBFC report said that because children are now able to watch films using portable devices on their own in their rooms or with their friends, ‘childhood years and their innocence are felt to be under threat with children being exposed to age-inappropriate content... at an earlier age than ever before’.

The results support the findings of the Bailey review in 2011, which said: ‘Children are under significant pressure to grow up at a faster pace than ever before.

Mothers of girls were particularly sensitive to the increasingly sexual and sexualised culture that their daughters are growing up in and worry about the long-term impact on their development.’ 

Bad language was also a big concern with the shock value of four-letter words diminishing with each generation.
