Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has said he has no worries about referee Mark Clattenburg taking charge of their game at Liverpool on Sunday despite the official missing a key penalty decision in last season's corresponding fixture.

In contrast to title rival Jose Mourinho who claims there is a 'campaign' against his Chelsea team, a contrite Pellegrini admitted he regrets criticising officials and insisted he should have remembered to praise Mr Clattenburg for his performance when Chelsea and City drew 1-1 at Stamford Bridge last month.

With clear reference to Mourinho, with whom he has long held a strained relationship, Pellegrini said: 'I don't want to talk about minutes.' The Chelsea boss listed the minutes of four controversial incidents against Burnley last weekend to make his point against referee Martin Atkinson.

The presence of Clattenburg in the middle at Anfield is intriguing with City knowing victory would take them within two points of leaders Chelsea.

The official failed to award City a late penalty for handball against Martin Skrtel in last season's 3-2 win for Liverpool – a decision that looked to have handed the title advantage to Liverpool at the time.

Pellegrini, who was banned by Uefa last year for saying Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson was 'not impartial' for sending off Martin Demichelis during their Champions League defeat against Barcelona, criticised Clattenburg earlier this season for his display in City's 2-2 draw against Arsenal at The Emirates Stadium.

'He had a very bad day against Liverpool and today he had a very bad day. Arsenal scored both goals with fouls,' he complained.

But having heard Mourinho wage war on officials for the past month, the Chilean was in a far more reflective mood.

'I don't have any worries about Mark Clattenburg because I think he's a good referee,' said Pellegrini.

'I criticised him after the game we played against Arsenal because I thought he didn't do well in that game. After that, he was terrific against Chelsea and I didn't remember in that moment to say that. That was a mistake on my part, to say he refereed very well and made no mistakes.

'It is very easy for us to say the referee has made a mistake, especially after you have seen it on television from three, four, five times from different angles. It's very easy to criticise.

Pellegrini praised the way Clattenburg handled his side's game with Jose Mourinho's Chelsea this season

The City boss has used his comments as a chance to make a thinly veiled attack on Mourinho's tactics

'Last year, in the Champions League, I criticised very hard the referee who sent off Demichelis because it wasn't a penalty, it was outside the box. But I said two weeks later I regretted it. I saw on TV it was just two centimetres outside the box, it was a mistake anyone could make.

'Mistakes can happen but they go against you or in favour of you.'

Pellegrini's attitude is in contrast to Mourinho's regular claims that officials are consistently against Chelsea. The pair have not got on since Mourinho followed Pellegrini as Real Madrid manager and belittled his time at the Bernabeu.

Even so, The FA might look at Pellegrini's comments as their rules prohibit any comment - good or bad - about referees prior to games. Sir Alex Ferguson was warned about his future conduct after he talked about Howard Webb before a big game against Chelsea in 2011, even though his comments were not derogatory.

Both City and Liverpool go into Sunday's game at High Noon on the back of European defeats although City have had an extra 48 hours to recover.

Defeat for either side would be hugely damaging – City for their prospects of retaining the championship, and Liverpool for qualifying for the Champions League.

Pellegrini says he will be prepared to play James Milner even though the versatile England international is out of contract at the end of the season and attracting interest from Liverpool.

The City boss knows he can't force Milner to sign a new deal at The Etihad but says it won't affect his team selection and that the player couldn't expect to play every week in any big-six club in England.

'I will choose the starting 11 from the players I think are in the best moment, not thinking what will happen with him (Milner) next year,' said Pellegrini.

'James hasn't been distracted. I know James Milner, he's a great professional, a player who always gives 100 per cent in every game. That decision about his future is his decision so I don't have any worry about that.

'Everyone in our club wants Milner to stay. After that, you have to make an arrangement with him, there are two parts to the contract. He must decide what he wants. I think an important squad must always have two important players for each position if you want to win something.

'You play so many games, have so many injuries. You need two important players in every position, this happens at Man United, at Chelsea, at Arsenal, at Liverpool, in our team.

'Important players must fight for their places. Nobody has a guarantee they will play, not Milner, not anyone. When you go to a big team, you have high competition. But I think James has played a lot this year.'

Pellegrini will assess Wilfried Bony before naming his side. The £28million striker has had a stuttering start to his City career since returning from the African Cup of Nations, confessing he has found it hard to adjust from sweltering heat in Equatorial Guinea to near-freezing temperatures in the north-west. 

He also took a bang after coming on as substitute against Barcelona on Tuesday, a match City lost 2-1.

Influential midfielder Yaya Toure was suspended for that game but returns at Anfield.
