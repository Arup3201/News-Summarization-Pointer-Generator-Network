Toronto mayor Rob Ford wants the video of him purportedly smoking crack cocaine released as a way to prove his innocence, his lawyer said today, despite the fact he denied it even existed at first.

The  explosive allegation was made public following the release of documents that form the basis of a major drug investigation.

Police say they rummaged through the garbage of the mayor of Canada's largest city and conducted an extensive surveillance operation to monitor him and close friend Alexander Lisi, Ford's sometime driver, who has been charged with marijuana trafficking and possession.

Toronto Mayor: Rob Ford leaves his house in Toronto, November 1, after police said on Thursday they have obtained a video 'consistent' with media accounts that it shows Ford smoking crack cocaine

Defiant: Ford, who has denied he smokes crack and on Thursday asserted he had no reason to resign, said he could not comment on the matter because the video is evidence in a separate case before the courts

Doorstepped: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford stands at the doorway of his house, in front of which a police car is parked, with two unidentified men, before leaving earlier today

Denial: Ford's lawyer said his client is 'innocent of any allegations made about his smoking crack cocaine' and suggested it was another substance like marijuana or tobacco

Today Ford's lawyer said his client is 'innocent of any allegations made about his smoking crack cocaine' and suggested it was another substance like marijuana or tobacco.

Speaking to CBC News, Dennis Morris said: 'No one is going to approach the media with a video saying he's smoking 
tobacco or marijuana â€” it's not salacious enough. It's 
not going to sell newspapers, it's not going to make headlines all over 
the world.

'In my view the reporters from The Toronto Star have probably never smoked crack cocaine as [have] probably 99 per cent of our citizenry,' said Morris.

Allegations that the Canadian mayor had been caught on camera puffing on a crack pipe first surfaced in May, sparking a surveillance investigation

Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair today confirmed forensics had obtained a copy of the video and that it is 'consistent with what has been previously described in various media reports'

In another twist, Ford's friend and former driver, Alexander Lisi, an alleged drug dealer, has been taken into custody and charged with extortion in relation to the video

Documents show Ford and Lisi exchanged 349 phone calls between Aug. 7 and Sept. 19 and had at least 100 meetings, where they would often exchange a bag or parcel
