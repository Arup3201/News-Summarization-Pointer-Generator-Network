This is the selfie kidnapper Chris Edwards produced to scare his victim into handing over money.

Grinning inanely with an AK47 assault rifle, it is one of a catalogue of chilling images by the gangster.

The 34-year-old kept the menacing image on his mobile phone to threaten those who dared to cross him.

Other photos he posted on Facebook showed him lounging around in a leopard print so-called 'pimp suit', posing with a bull terrier dog and shouting at police during the 2012 riots.

In September, the Manchester-based gangster was arrested after holding a man captive for three hours and threatening him with a machete.

During his ordeal, the victim was shown the picture of Edwards in a bid to make him hand over drugs money.

The unnamed victim, 31, was later freed unharmed and went to the police.

Today Edwards from Salford, Greater Manchester was jailed for ten years after he was found guilty of false imprisonment and possession of drugs with intent to supply.

Jacob Minister, 25, of Salford was jailed for 15 years after he was found guilty following a trial of false imprisonment, possession with intent to supply and using an imitation firearm with the intention of causing harm or distress.

He said he had been storing cocaine for Minister and had decided to stop. But after he was allowed home, the man was summoned to a meeting by Edwards and Minister.

Moments later a black Corsa pulled up with both Edwards and Minister inside, the victim got in and was told he wasn’t going anywhere until he had 'paid the money he owed.'

Minister took the victim’s phone and accused him of being bugged and said if he tried to escape he would be stabbed.

They then went to Edwards’ house where the victim was terrorised before being driven home. He managed to contact his partner to say he was being held against his will and Edwards and Minister were arrested in a police swoop.

Detective Constable Sean Fitzgerald said after the case: 'These two men preyed on a vulnerable man, they provided him with drugs on tick and when he could not pay they started to use him to store their supply.

'The threats escalated and when they found out he told the police he was storing drugs on their behalf, he was kidnaped and held at knife point.

'If he had not been able to contact his partner who knows what these men could have been capable of.'

Chief Superintendant Mary Doyle, divisional commander for Salford, said: 'Over the past few years, we have had some tremendous successes in Salford in tackling organised criminal gangs.

'We have seized millions of pounds worth of drugs, firearms and cash and as residents will have already seen, we have secured some lengthy convictions for some of these organised crime group members.

'By taking so many of these gang members off the streets and seizing huge quantities of drugs and other items associated with criminality, we have made massive inroads into disrupting these criminal networks and as a result, Salford is a safer place to live and work.'
