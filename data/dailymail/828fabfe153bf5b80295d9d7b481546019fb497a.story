A Philadelphia company has unveiled its innovative bike for children that never falls over.

Called the Jyrobike, it makes clever use of gyroscopes to keep the bike balanced even when a child leans from side-to-side.

According to the company, this means a child can learn to ride the bike in just one day.

The Jyrobike (pictured) claims to offer children a fast and easy method to learn how to ride a bicycle. A rapidly spinning disc inside the front wheel acts as a gyroscope that stabilises the bike when a kid leans from side to side so that they don't fall over, and it can be controlled remotely by a parent

The Jyrobike, which is currently part of a Kickstarter campaign, works on the principle that a bike is more stable at higher speeds.

Inside the front wheel of the bicycle is a fast spinning disc.

Motor power: 14.4 watts

Battery life: 3-4 hours

Max flywheel speed: 2,000 RPM

Weight: 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds)

Size: 12 or 16 inches (30 or 40 centimetres)

Connectivity: Micro USB

Water Resistant: Yes

This creates a gyroscopic force that balances the bike even when it is ridden slowly, as might be expected for a child getting behind the handlebars for the first time.

A ‘control hub’ in the front wheel dictates how the gyroscope acts.

This can also be bought separately and attached to another bike.

It can change the rate that the disc in the front wheel spins to give a rider different levels of stability.

This means as a rider improves, the assistance can be toned down.

And ultimately, once they are comfortable, the spinning disc can be removed to reduce the weight of the front wheel by 60 per cent.

There are two versions of the bike available; the smaller 12-inch (30 centimetres) version costs £179 ($249), while the larger 16-inch (40 centimetres) bike is £219 ($299).

As seen here the Jyrobike is stable even when it is given a gentle push and it is allowed to move by itself with the gyroscope inside the front wheel enabled

A remote control can be used to alter the 'control hub' in the front wheel of the bike. This means a parent can change the stability assistance afforded to a child as they ride. This means as a rider improves, the assistance can be toned down, or it can be turned up if they are struggling

‘The genius behind our technology is that it covertly promotes correct riding technique,’ the company said on their Kickstarter page.

‘It takes the stress out of teaching, eliminates fears of falling and gets the whole family out riding together faster than trial and error, balance bikes or training wheels.’

The speed of the spinning disc in the front tyre can also be adjusted remotely, so an adult can quickly increase the stability if their child is far away and looks like they are about to fall, for example.

The disc inside the bike can be charged with a Micro USB cable and lasts for about three hours, and the software inside can also be updated by connecting it to a computer.

Production on the Jyrobike is due to start 'soon' and it is expected to hit the market in January 2015.

And next year the company also hopes to build an adult version that uses the same technology in a larger bike to help older people learn how to ride.

The Jyrobike is available to preorder now at the company's Kickstarter page, with production expected to begin later this year. The first bikes will be shipped in January 2015. The company also hopes to design a larger version of the bike next year that can be used by adults learning to ride
