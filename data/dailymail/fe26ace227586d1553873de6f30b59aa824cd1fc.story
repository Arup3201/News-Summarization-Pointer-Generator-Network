A dial-a-drug gang which took more than 1,000 orders a day from desperate customers on an advertised crime hotline has been jailed for 33 years collectively. 

At the height of its success the gang, headed by 30-year-old Sahil Patel, was delivering Class A drugs to hundreds of people across east London every day. 

It took orders for crack cocaine and heroin on a 24 hour phone number advertised across the area which customers could either phone or text to pay to have drugs delivered.

Nine of its members have been jailed at Snaresbrook Crown Court after police recovered 900g of crack cocaine and heroin with a street value of more than £60,000.  

Phone records show that over a 92 day period, more than 66,000 phone calls and 7937 text messages were made to the phone number in Dagenham, Barking, Ilford, Redbridge and Newham.  

Customers could place orders for crack cocaine or heroin and have them delivered to their front doors, the court heard. 

An estimated 750 people are thought to have contacted the number with around 700 calls and 86 texts sent every day. 

Patel, the organisation's ringleader, was in charge of setting up the phone line and taking orders while eight others were trusted to distribute drugs. 

Shenola Nightingale, 26, and Imran Shahid, 35, were also jailed. The pair were tried at Snaresbrook Crown Court alongside the rest of the gang which took more than 1,000 orders a day at its peak 

Adeyemi Adeniyi, 51, (left) was jailed for 30 months at an earlier court date while 21-year-old Aqib Mumtaz (right), the gang's youngest member, was sentenced to two years behind bars

Tashin Ali, 23, (left) was jailed after earlier standing trial while 43-year-old Abdulkadir Mohamed (right) is yet to be sentenced

He was jailed for 16 years after being found guilty of possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life, and conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.  

In 2001, when he was 19, he was jailed over separate drug offences. During a trial in Ilford it was heard proclaimed himself 'the best drug dealer in east London'. 

Eight others were charged with drug offences in the latest Metropolitan Police investigation.

Roqib Ali, 37, was also convicted of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs 

Hamza Patel, 26,  was jailed for six years and six months after admitting conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.  

Imran Shahid, 35, Shenola Nightingale, 26, Roqib Ali, 37, Aqib Mumtaz, 21, Tashin Ali, 23, and Adeyemi Adeniyi, 51, were all given varying sentences for the same offence among others which included dangerous driving. 

Abdulkadir Mohamed, 43, was also convicted of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. He is yet to be sentenced.  

The court heard how Sahil Patel was the head of an enterprise supplying Class A drugs across east London. 

During the course of the police investigation, officers from the Trident Area Gangs Command seized 620g of crack cocaine and 302g heroin with a street value in excess of £60,000.

Detective Inspector Steve Meechan of the Trident and Area Crime Command, said: 'The sentences handed out should serve as a significant deterrent to anyone involved in criminality of this kind.

'The harm caused across east London by these criminals cannot be underestimated and I'm pleased that they now face prison for a significant length of time. 

'This is an outstanding result and reflects the professionalism and dedication of the Trident and Area Crime Command.'
