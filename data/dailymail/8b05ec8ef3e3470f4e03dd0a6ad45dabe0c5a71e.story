Tragedy: The girl who was killed by a falling wall at an Edinburgh school was named locally as Keane Grace Wallis-Bennett by friends

A girl of 12 was crushed to death when a school wall collapsed yesterday after staff allegedly ignored repeated warnings that it was dangerous.

Keane Wallis-Bennett screamed that she could hear something falling but was unable to scramble out of the way as the gym changing room wall crashed down, witnesses said.

Paramedics were called to Liberton High School in Edinburgh but could not save her. Keane’s classmates escaped injury.

Police began an investigation last night as pupils said they had warned teachers about the ‘wobbly’ wall several months ago but nothing was done.

In February, Edinburgh Council was fined £8,000 after a 15-year-old pupil was seriously injured falling 16ft down a lift shaft at the school in December 2011.

Second-year pupil Demi Thomson, 13, said after yesterday’s tragedy: 'There was not a bad bone in Keane’s body. She was always smiling and she had loads of friends.

‘I was told she went into the changing room and yelled out that she could hear something falling, but couldn’t get out of the way of the wall in time.

‘We have all had concerns about that changing room for a long time and lots of people complained. It is absolutely heart-breaking, everyone was in tears when they heard.’

Devon Blyth, 13, said: ‘I told staff months ago but nothing was done. I think they should have done something about it.

‘I reported it, about two months ago, that the wall had moved when I leaned on it. The member of staff said it would be fine.

‘The wall is almost the length of the changing room and it separated the showers.’

Her father, David, said: ‘It should have been dealt with when it was reported.’

Victim: The 12-year-old died after the changing room wall collapsed and crushed her as she was getting dressed for a PE lesson

Tributes: Friends and parents left flowers and cards at the school today after the tragic death of the pupil

Message: A note was left with these roses, it read: 'Rest in peace Keane, God has gained another angel. Sleep tight princess'

News of the tragedy, which happened at
 10am, was broken at special assemblies but most of the 650 pupils had 
already read about Keane’s death online. They were later sent home for 
the day, many of them in tears.

Frantic parents rushed to the school after being alerted by text message that a pupil had died in an ‘accident’.

 Some feared the incident could be a repeat of the 1996 Dunblane school massacre.

Last
 night a floral tribute was left under the entrance to the  school with 
the message: ‘Rest in peace Keane. God has gained another angel.’

One of Keane’s best friends, Reece Anderton, 12, said: ‘She was really popular and funny. I will miss her terribly.’

Parents
 and pupils claimed school, built 55 years ago, was crumbling and said 
it had to be closed for several weeks three years ago after the roof of a
 science block caved in under the weight of fallen snow.

Chloe Scott, 14, ‘It is absolutely shocking, the school should be shut down. It is falling apart.

‘I’m scared to go back into school now. There are serious health and safety issues.’

Amy Gallacher, 14, said: ‘We were in class when we heard and everyone was in a complete state of shock.

‘The school should be torn down, it is not a safe place.

Tragedy: The girl was killed at Liberton High School in Edinburgh just before 10am this morning, with police, fire and ambulance crews all attending the scene

Accident: Emergency services attempted to revive the girl, but the crush injuries proved fatal

‘Teachers
 knew the wall was dangerous and yet they did nothing.’ Another parent, 
who asked not to be named, said: ‘I think it’s horrendous. It’s just so 
sad for her family. But the school has been falling apart for years.

‘A girl fell down the lift shaft a couple of years ago and then the school had to be closed for weeks when we had heavy snow.

‘I
 think it’s ridiculous when it comes to this. I heard it happened in the
 old gym building, which has been there for quite some time.

‘It is an old building and things are clearly going wrong.’

Politicians
 described Keane’s death as ‘tragic and troubling’ and said ‘serious 
questions’ needed to be asked. Police Scotland said an inquiry into the 
incident was under way.

Andy Gray, from Edinburgh City Council, said he was not aware of any earlier concerns about the wall.

‘We are working with the police and the Health and Safety Executive to really find out thoroughly what has happened,’ he said.

The
 Edinburgh Evening News reported in December that £80million was needed 
to patch up the city’s schools, but the council has only a £30million 
budget for repairs.

Upset: Parents came to the school to collect their children today after the terrible incident

Injuries: Morgan Seaton who fell down the lift shaft at Liberton High School three years ago. The council admitted they were to blame for the accident

Morgan Seaton was seriously injured when she plunged down a lift shaft at Liberton High, the same school where Keane Wallis-Bennett was crushed to death.

The fourth-year pupil was 15 at the time of the accident in December 2011. She suffered three fractured vertebrae, bruising to her back and a sprained wrist after falling 16ft as teachers tried to free her from a broken-down lift.

The teenager was spared from more serious injury only because she was wearing boots which stopped her ankles being shattered. She spent two days in hospital and was off school for a fortnight.

When she returned, she was unable to sit for long periods, making studying for exams difficult.

Edinburgh City Council was fined £8,000 for breaching health and safety regulations at the school.

Afterwards Miss Seaton said the accident wrecked her hopes of becoming a hairdresser. She said: ‘When your back is damaged you’re going to suffer problems throughout your life and that will be the situation for me.

‘I had to give up a career in hairdressing, which was my dream, because I wouldn’t have been able to do all the standing and bending required. My back just wouldn’t have taken it.

‘It was very disappointing, because it’s what I wanted to do. I would certainly hope the council have put regulations in place to stop the same thing from happening to anyone else.’
