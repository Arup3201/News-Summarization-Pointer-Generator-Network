A former anorexic has beaten her demons and the bullies, to conquer her illness and become a beauty queen.

Rosie Essex, 17, from Milton Keynes, was tormented for years about the way she looked.

At the age of 13, her weight plummeted to just five-and-a-half stone.

But after years of battling her eating disorder, Rosie is now a healthy size eight and is finally happy with her life and the way she looks.

Turning her life around: Rosie Essex, 17, was tormented so severely about the way she looked but now she's beat her anorexia and become a beauty queen as a result

Illness: Rosie's weight plummeted to just five-and-a-half-stone when she was 13-years-old

Healthy: After years of suffering with her weight, Rosie is now a healthy size eight and is finally happy with her life and the way she looks

Rosie said: 'I struggled to eat as my self-esteem had become so low, I just wanted to be accepted.

'It
 feels so amazing to now have the confidence to enter beauty pageants.

'It’s a long life dream that I never thought would come true.'

Rosie’s 
bullies made her believe she was overweight and after three years of 
allowing her eating disorder to rule her life, Rosie finally beat her 
illness and found the confidence to enter her first beauty pageant.

She
 said: 'It was such an amazing feeling being on stage and being 
surrounded by other girls who finally accepted me for who I am.

'I entered Miss Teen Great Britain 2014 and was in the top five and plan to enter again this year.

'The
 pageant really helped me to believe in myself and be the person that I 
want to be.

'I’m really outgoing and bubbly now which is so refreshing.

'I no longer feel like I have to hide away.'

Beauty queen: Rosie finally beat her illness and found the confidence to enter her first beauty pageant and thanks to the huge boost from the beauty pageants, performing arts and dancing Rosie has excelled

Support system: Rosie says her mother has been her rock throughout everything. ' I really don't think I could've beat this awful disease without her,' she said

Changing her life: Rosie says she was willing to do anything to rise above all the taunts and become an inspiration to other young women

Battle: Bullies targeted Rosie, pictured during her illness, for the puppy fat she had as a youngster, tormenting her and causing her to cry every day

Recalling how cruel the other children at school were, Rosie said: 'I’d be laughed at and called names like Trevor the bulldog.

'I had puppy fat when I was younger and I was timid so I guess I was easy prey for people.

'I remember when I started secondary school the bullying became so intense I would cry every single day.

'Once, some girls took my school uniform during our P.E. lesson and put it under the showers so it was soaking wet.

'I had to walk around for the rest of the day in my P.E. kit whilst everyone laughed and told me how fat I looked.'

Rosie spent every day thinking of ways to change her appearance - she hated everything about the way she looked.

So she began starving herself and putting on make-up to please her peers.

She said: 'I
 just wanted to be someone that no-one would pick on so I would starve 
myself for days. 

'When I was 14 I had a long-term relationship, I guess I felt accepted so I allowed myself to eat healthily again.

'When we broke up though I didn’t feel good enough. I relapsed as I wanted to punish myself.'

Rosie
 has since beat her eating disorder and is picking up lead positions in 
musical theatre, modelling and singing, as well as taking part in beauty
 pageants.

Now and then: Rosie, pictured, right, during her illness, and, left, now she has got her life back on track and feels much happier with herself

Happy: Rosie says she is so proud of herself and what she's accomplished in the last few years since beating her eating disorder

Rosie said: 'I’m in a completely different place now, surrounded by people who love and support me.

'I have a healthy balanced diet as well as keeping fit by going to the gym.

'I’ve met so many amazing people, I've completely changed my life and have a new open perspective of things.

'I’m so proud of myself and what I’ve accomplished in the last few years. I’ve won various awards for placing second or first in singing acting and dancing competitions, which I’m particularly proud of.'

Thanks to the huge boost from the beauty pageants, performing arts and dancing Rosie has excelled in the last year.

Rosie said: 
'Even though I was so weak from starving myself and I still went to 
every dance class because my drive for success is so powerful.

'I was willing to do anything to rise above all the taunts and become an inspiration to other young women.

'My mum has been my rock throughout everything, I really don’t think I could’ve beat this awful disease without her.

'I’m really looking forward to entering Miss Teen Great Britain again next month.

Success: Since getting better, she has won various awards for placing second or first in singing acting and dancing competitions, which she's particularly proud of

Proud: Rosie's mother said: 'She really has beat the bullies, it makes me so happy to see her smiling on that stage'

'I’m such a positive person now and I hope other girls who are being bullied like I was can see past it all.

'My advice would be to try your hardest to not let other people get you down.

'Every girl is beautiful in her own right, it seems like there’s no other choice but please just speak to someone about the way you’re feeling.

'Us girls go through changes every day, don’t let the present tarnish your bright future, because my mum always told me that after a rainstorm there is always a rainbow ahead.

'I don’t want anyone to lose three years of their life like I did.'

Rosie’s 
mother Mariette, 51, said: 'One day Rosie came home covered in cuts and 
bruises that’s when I decided to move her to a different school.

'Some boys on the bus had thrown their trainers with studs on at Rosie, I was in utter disbelief.

'I was so worried about my little girl, I hated seeing her looking so gaunt and skinny.

'She’s always been beautiful on the inside and out and I’m so proud of everything she’s achieved.

'She really has beat the bullies, it makes me so happy to see her smiling on that stage.'
