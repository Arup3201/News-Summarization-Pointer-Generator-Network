At least 40 passengers have suffered injuries after an Amtrak train crashed into a tractor-trailer that had become stuck on railroad tracks in North Carolina and toppled onto its side.

Startling images from the scene show the truck, which was carrying a mobile home beneath a blue tarp, smashed to pieces across the tracks in Halifax and two derailed train cars lying nearby.

Halifax County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Bruce Temple said the accident happened around noon and that the train's first two cars were derailed in the incident, although the second car that derailed was holding baggage. 

The North Carolina Department of Transportation reported that 25 passengers were taken to Halifax Memorial Hospital by bus and 15 passengers taken to Halifax hospital by ambulance for treatment. No deaths were reported and that none of the injuries appeared to be life threatening, authorities said.

A witness driving behind the truck told WRAL that the vehicle had been trying to navigate a left-hand turn across the tracks for around 15 minutes before the crash and was getting help from a state trooper.

They saw the train come into view and witnesses recalled seeing one person climb out of the truck.

'There was a massive jerk and we were kind of thrown forward a little bit, and the train came to a sudden stop,' passenger Charlotte Story told WRAL-TV. 'I couldn't tell you if it was trying to slow down or not. There was no whistle. It came completely out of the blue.'

Photos taken by RRSPIN show the overturned truck and wrecked mobile home on its side as investigators swarm the scene. Witnesses helped state Highway Patrol troopers pull the conductor from the wreckage, RRSPIN reported.

Sheriff's Major Scott Hall said from the crash scene that some passengers were taken to a local hospital by ambulance, but others were able to climb aboard a shuttle bus to be taken for examination.

Other passengers were taken to a nearby government center where they would meet with American Red Cross officials and investigators.

Of the passengers on the train, around 170 were unhurt, authorities told WRAL. 

'There were 212 passengers and eight crew members on board and initial reports are that several passengers have been injured and taken to local medical facilities for treatment,' an Amtrak spokesperson said. 'At this time, none of the injuries have been reported as life threatening.'

The Amtrak train was the Carolinian, which runs between Charlotte, North Carolina, and New York each day. It was headed north to New York City at the time of the crash. Authorities said there are active warning devices at the crossing.

The truck belonged to Guy M. Turner Inc., an industrial transport specialist based in Greensboro. The company said they are investigating.

The North Carolina Department of Transportation is also investigating.

'We are relieved that there are no fatalities reported at this time, and our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured,' Transportation Secretary Tony Tata said in a statement. 'Safety is always our top priority, and we continue to urge everyone to use extreme caution and stay alert when crossing our railroad tracks.'

Authorities have closed nearby roads as they clear up the scene. Halifax is about 80 miles northeast of Raleigh.

Lucky: Authorities said none of the injured passengers on the derailed train had life-threatening injuries but no deaths were reported

Smash: Of the two cars that derailed after the train smashed into the stalled vehicle, one was a luggage car, authorities said 

Taken to safety: Around 40 people were transported to nearby hospitals for treatment and 170 more were taken away by buses
