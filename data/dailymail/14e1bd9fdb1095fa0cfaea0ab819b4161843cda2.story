Many sportspeople from around the world have undertaken the Ice Bucket Challenge in support of ALS with minimum fuss.

However, PSV Eindhoven took things to the extreme when they participated in the worldwide phenomenon after being nominated by fellow Dutch side Ajax - as their squad were blasted with water by police water cannons.

The Dutch side decided to go against the original quota as such to get a bucket of ice cold water over your head, very much raising the stakes for future challenges with this impressive showing.

 As well as getting soaked by the large trucks they also warmed up with some small buckets - or in other words what everyone else has done until then.

Their Dutch counterparts Ajax, who of course nominated them, must have been impressed at the lengths their rivals took as they outdid their attempts.

Despite only being early on in the season PSV are also winning the battle on the field over their Dutch rivals.

Only goal difference separates the two sides, as well as FC Groningen and PEC Zwolle, as PSV lead the win after two games in the Eredivisie as they look to improve on last season's fourth placed finish.
