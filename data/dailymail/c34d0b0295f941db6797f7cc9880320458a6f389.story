A Tennessee patient who was put in isolation and tested for Ebola does not have the deadly virus, their results last night revealed.

The unnamed individual, from Memphis, was quarantined at Methodist University Hospital in what officials called 'an abundance of caution' after falling ill with symptoms of the disease.

Despite not meeting all of the qualifications for Ebola, the patient was blood tested and quizzed on where they had recently traveled and who they had been in contact with.

But last night, their test results confirmed they have not been struck down with Ebola, which has so far killed 4,922 people, mainly in the West African nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

In a statement, MUH corporate communications specialist Mary Alice Taylor told WAFF-TV that medics would continue to monitor the patient.

'The state health department just alerted us that the test result was negative for Ebola for the patient at Methodist University Hospital,' she said.

'We will continue to monitor and care for the patient. We proceeded with an abundance of caution and this experience makes our staff even better prepared should we face a case in the future.

'We are all pleased with the outcome, and believe we are now even better prepared going forward. We're grateful for the leadership and guidance from our local and state health departments.'

North/South: Ebola cases have been reported in the north and deep-south United States. If diagnosed, the patient would have been the first to contract the disease in the mid-south

The patient was transferred to the hospital from Methodist South Hospital yesterday amid concerns the Ebola virus had finally struck the mid-south of the U.S. as well as the deep south and north. 

Yesterday afternoon, the individual was said to be in stable condition and an 'alternate primary diagnosis was reportedly established.'

This means that the patient could have an illness with symptoms similar to that of the Ebola virus, according to WREG.  

Local Memphis reports that the patient's blood samples were sent to the State Lab in Nashville. The final results apparently came from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Ebola Virus: The Tennessee Hospital Association, Tennessee Medical Association and Tennessee Nurses Association announced that they are in a partnership with the Tennessee Department of Health as well as other agencies in a cautious effort to be proactive about any potential Ebola cases

The news of the patient comes just days after Tennessee health officials began ensuring appropriate protocols and policies to handle possible Ebola cases are in place.

The Tennessee Hospital Association, Tennessee Medical Association and Tennessee Nurses Association announced that they are in a partnership with the Tennessee Department of Health as well as other agencies in a cautious effort to be proactive about any potential Ebola cases. 

Local Memphis reported last week that Memphis EMT's have been preparing for Ebola and have been getting multiple updates daily on how to handle it.

'This is an important time for education and awareness, not only about Ebola, but our emergency preparedness and how we communicate with our EMT's and our hospitals,'  Elizabeth Hart of the Shelby County Health Department told Local Memphis.
