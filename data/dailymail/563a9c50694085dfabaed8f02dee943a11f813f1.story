Bournemouth moved a point clear at the top of the Sky Bet Championship table thanks to a 2-0 win at Rotherham after Derby had tasted defeat at home to Nottingham Forest.

Tommy Elphick and Callum Wilson were on target as the Cherries bounced back from last week's loss against Norwich to make it six wins from their last seven league games.

Derby went into the early match joint top and took the lead through a Henri Lansbury own goal, but Britt Assombalonga levelled for Forest and Ben Osborn's stoppage-time strike gave the visitors a 2-1 victory.

Ipswich moved up to second thanks to a 3-1 success at Millwall, with Noel Hunt bagging a brace for the Tractor Boys and Jonathan Parr also netting, while the Lions could only reply through Magaye Gueye.

Lee Tomlin struck both goals as Middlesbrough beat Huddersfield 2-0, while Andre Gray scored as Brentford prevailed 1-0 at Brighton, who had Lewis Dunk dismissed.

There was no dream start for new Charlton boss Guy Luzon as the Addicks were thrashed 5-0 at Watford, with Odion Ighalo hitting a double for the Hornets and Craig Cathcart, Troy Deeney and Daniel Tozser also on the scoresheet.

However, Alex Neil's honeymoon period at Norwich continued as they survived a Cardiff fightback to win 3-2 at Carrow Road, with Gary Hooper, Kyle Lafferty and Cameron Jerome putting the Canaries in control before the Bluebirds rallied through Alex Revell and Kadeem Harris.

Bryan Ruiz bagged a stoppage-time winner as Fulham edged out Reading 2-1, with Pavel Pogrebnyak having earlier equalised Alex Kacaniklic's opener.

Leeds claimed a late point in a 1-1 draw with Birmingham, with a Paul Caddis penalty putting the Blues ahead early on at Elland Road before Luke Murphy levelled on 86 minutes.

Sheffield Wednesday had substitute Sam Hutchinson sent off as they went down 2-1 at home to Bolton, with Liam Freeney and Darren Pratley on target for Wanderers before Chris Maguire pulled one back for the Owls from the spot.

Dave Edwards and new signing Benik Afobe struck late on as Wolves beat Blackpool 2-0, while Wigan and Blackburn shared the spoils in a 1-1 Lancashire derby draw, with James McClean equalising for the Latics after Corry Evans had put Rovers ahead.
