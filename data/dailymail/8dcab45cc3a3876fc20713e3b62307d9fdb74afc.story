Boris Johnson yesterday threw down the gauntlet to David Cameron by calling for tough union reforms to combat strikes.

The London Mayor warned it was time to stop the ‘endless buggeration’ that disrupts public services amid fresh threats of a General Strike by union barons.

His proposal raised eyebrows in Westminster – especially as he caved in to union demands for bonuses worth up to £35million to transport workers threatening to strike over the Olympics.

Speaking out: Boris Johnson threw down the gauntlet to David Cameron 
last night by publicly challenging him to impose a new wave of union 
reforms to combat the threat of a General Strike

But unveiling an anti-strike 
blueprint, Mr Johnson has now called for strikes to be outlawed unless a
50 per cent threshold of members take part in a vote.

The London Mayor also wants to ban 
all-out strikes among key public service workers such as paramedics, 
firemen and transport staff, forcing them to maintain a basic service, 
and stop strikers intimidating workers.

The proposals will be seen as further evidence of Mr Johnson’s ambition to succeed David Cameron as Tory leader.

His supporters say his proposals are 
the ‘21st Century equivalent’ of the union reforms pioneered by Margaret
Thatcher and Norman Tebbit in the 1980s.

Mr Johnson insisted the measures would
help Mr Cameron’s drive to boost the economy and dismissed reports he 
was plotting his downfall as ‘twaddle’.

He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We’re going through difficult economic times.

‘It [a General Strike] would be 
damaging to the economy, it’s not in the interests of unions or their 
members and it is unlikely to carry much support.

‘What we don’t want to see as unions 
start to flex their muscles in the autumn is a return to the unfair and 
unnecessary strikes and ballots that put a terrific psychological burden
on people who don’t want to take strike action.

There are hard-working people on London’s transport system who are unnerved by what is going on.

‘There are intimidating people who 
stop them getting to work, or a strike is called on the basis of a very 
small proportion of the relevant workforce.’

He insisted that it was ‘not realistic’ to introduce a total ban on strikes.

But he said: ‘What it does is take 
away unions’ power to cause endless grief and stress by threatening 
strikes and causing endless disruption and buggeration.’

Downing Street is understood to be dismissive of Mr Johnson’s plans and wants a more ‘watered down’ version.

A Number 10 insider said: ‘Most unions are a busted flush.

'If we give Boris everything he wants, it could backfire.’
