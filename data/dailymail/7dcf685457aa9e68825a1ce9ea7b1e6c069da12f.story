England stand-in captain Eoin Morgan pulled no punches in his review of his side's 157-run defeat by Sri Lanka in the second Royal London one-day international at Chester-le-Street.

The batsman, who top scored with 40 in England's total of 99 chasing Sri Lanka's 256, described it as 'abysmal', 'sloppy' and 'disappointing'.

Morgan took charge after Alastair Cook pulled out on Sunday morning with a groin strain.

'Abysmal really,' he told Sky Sports when asked about the performance.

'I cannot explain it. We lost wickets continuously throughout the whole innings and underperformed massively. We have been outplayed here today in conditions we normally thrive in. We have played poorly. It's very disappointing and we were a little bit sloppy in the field.'

England put two routine catches down and Ian Bell also admitted the team was poor in the field.

'No excuses at all,' Bell said. 'There's no excuses from us. We have got to find some answers for the next game at Old Trafford. We are just really disappointed. It was not a 99 all-out wicket.'

With the five-match series at 1-1, the teams next meet in Manchester on Wednesday.

Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews said: 'It was a pleasing performance by the whole team. All in all it was a great effort.'
