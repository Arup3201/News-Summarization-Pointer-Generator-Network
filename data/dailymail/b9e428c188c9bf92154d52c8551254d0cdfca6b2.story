Ben Thompson, 34, a Welsh rugby fan who died when he fell into a river after drinking while watching the opening game of the Six Nations tournament at the Millennium Stadium

A husband who won a 'free bar' for a Six Nations rugby match was killed when he fell into a river after an eight-hour drinking session, an inquest heard.

Ben Thompson, 34, tumbled into the water as he tried to walk back to his hotel after drinking in an executive hospitality box.

The engineer, of Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, had won a £250-a-head hospitality package through work and was wined and dined as he watched Wales play Ireland at the Millennium Stadium.

Mr Thompson and fellow business colleagues had started drinking as early as 10.15am on the day of the game.

The drink and food was laid on in the plush box  and he kept on drinking until till 6.15pm when he left a bar.

His body was found more than a month later in the River Ely in Cardiff after he fell in while trying to find his hotel.

His wife told how excited Mr Thompson had kissed her goodbye to travel to Cardiff for the game.

But he never came home - and his widow Joanne, 38, today warned sports fans to be careful how much they drink.

She said: 'I don't want anyone else to have to go through what I have gone through.

'We all go out and have a few drinks but don't go mad - something like this can happen to anyone.

'I would just like to tell other people to be careful, look after yourself, stay in touch with their friends, let them know what they are doing.

'Wives, please tell your partners to behave themselves.'

She added: 'Ben was my husband but I have been left alone because of this tragic set of circumstances.'

Fit and healthy Mr Thompson, who worked at South Hook LNG Terminal Site, in Pembrokeshire,  travelled 100 miles from his home to the Welsh capital for the first match in this year's Six Nations tournament in February.

He had been given tickets as a prize from work.

Joanne told the court: 'I hate it when he goes away, but when he went he kissed me and said don't worry, it's only two nights.

'He was so excited about going to Cardiff and he was overjoyed that he had won tickets to the game.'

Mr Thompson started his day off at the Yard pub in the city centre where he had 'two or three drinks'.

Cardiff Coroners Court heard how he then went to the Millennium Stadium and drank there for up to five hours.

Mrs Thompson, who was married for six years, added: 'He called me after the match, he was shouting and telling me he was on the way to 10 Feet Tall - which was our favourite pub in Cardiff.

'I could tell he was half cut because he kept repeating himself - that was the last time I spoke to him.'

Mr Thompson and and his colleagues drank 'all sorts of rounds and shorts' late into the evening.

Friends left him queuing to get into a city centre branch of O'Neills Irish Bar but he never made it inside.

Manhunt: A search was launched after the engineer disappeared

Mrs Thompson added: 'Ben was extremely fit and health-conscious, his metabolism was so good - this must have affected his ability to handle alcohol.

'He was not a frequent drinker but he would binge drink with his work colleagues - they were all quite big but he felt like he had to keep up with them.

'They would call people names if they couldn't drink as much and Ben didn't like that.'

The keen cyclist and hiker tried to walk more than 15 miles back to the hotel he was staying at on the outskirts of the city.

She added: 'He would rather walk home than catch a taxi - distance wasn't an issue, he would walk for miles if needed.

A witness who saw him not long before he died said he appeared drunk

'I told him not to binge drink. I told him that one day he would never come home - I didn't think it would actually happen.'

Mr Thompson's disappearance sparked a massive manhunt across Cardiff with search parties and sniffer dogs looking for the rugby fan.

His last movements captured on CCTV showed him staggering down a dead end lane leading to wasteland and the river.

Debra Sexton was one of the last people to see him alive. In a statement read to the court she said: 'I remember thinking to myself: "Gosh he's drunk".

'He was walking side to side, taking one step forward and two back - but he seemed to be walking with a purpose, he seemed to be know where he was going.

Pathologist Meleri Morgan said that hitting the cold water while drunk could have caused a heart attack or his throat to close

'I thought he must be cold because he wasn't wearing a coat, I thought he was vulnerable because he was so drunk.'

The body was finally found in the River Ely in March - more than a month after he vanished.

PC Gareth Davies said when Mr Thompson's pockets were emptied they found an Ireland v Wales Six Nations badge and change from the rounds of drink he had bought.

Cardiff coroner Miss Mary Hassell recorded a verdict of accidental death and said the cause of death was sudden immersion in water having taken alcohol.

She said: 'Ben did as literally thousands of other men did on that day, he went out, he watched the game and tried to walk home.

'He just had the misfortune to slip or trip and fall into the water - he died as soon as he entered the water.'
