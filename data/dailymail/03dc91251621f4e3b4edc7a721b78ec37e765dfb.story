Lindsey Vonn is getting over her massive disappointment at missing out at the Sochi Olympics by spending lots of quality time with her new four-legged friend, a dog who also has a bad knee.

The four-time World Cup Champion skier was 'devastated' last Tuesday when she announced that she would not be competing at next month's Olympics.

But Vonn cheered herself up a day later by bringing home Leo, a 9-month-old boxer mix, from a Florida animal shelter. Since then she's happily mentioned the new addition many times.

Pick-me-up: A day after Vonn announced that her injured knee would keep her out of the Olympics next month, the skier went out and adopted a homeless dog which also has a bad knee

Comfort: Vonn wrote on Instagram. I adopted Leo today from an animal shelter and he has cheered me up so much! He was hit by a car and has a bad knee. Maybe we can do rehab together! #meantforeachother #bumkneebuddies

On Friday Vonn posted a picture of the excited puppy running next to the waves and wrote: Morning walk on the beach with Leo. He seems very happy to be out of his cage!

'Can't wait to take him home to Vail and show him snow for the first time! #iloveleo #happydistraction' the injury-plagued skier added.

The same day Vonn paid a Twitter tribute to how much Leo is helping her mood.

'My new puppy is helping me so much. It's
 hard to not get down right now but he is getting me through it. 
#puppylove #whoisresucuingwho,' she wrote.

Upset: In a Facebook posting last week, Vonn said she is 'devastated' to miss the Olympics, 'but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level'

Together: Vonn instagrammed this photo on Friday with the caption: 'Morning walk on the beach with Leo. I think he's happy to be out of his cage :) #excitedpuppy'

Companionship: 'Maybe we can do rehab together! #meantforeachother,' Vonn joked on Instagram, adding that Leo has cheered her up so much

'He has a bad knee, just like me,' a limping Vonn told reporters as she led the pup from a Jupiter, Florida, shelter on Wednesday.

Vonn first saw the injured dog the day before Christmas Eve, according to WPBF. At the time, her high-profile boyfriend, golfer Tiger Woods wanted a different dog.

But workers at Furry Friends in Jupiter said she came back announcing 'I won!' before adopting Leo. Down in the dumps Vonn posted a photo of herself with the dog on Twitter Wednesday evening.

'Leo brightened my day,' she wrote. 'Has a bum knee bc a car hit him #bumkneebuddies #puppylove.'

'Maybe we can do rehab together! #meantforeachother,' Vonn joked on Instagram, adding that Leo has cheered her up so much.

She explained on Facebook that Leo 'has a bad knee from being hit by a 
car when he was a puppy and no one wanted him...but I do!!

Adoption: Vonn explained on Facebook that Leo 'has a bad knee from being hit by a car when he was a puppy and no one wanted him...but I do!!

Help: 'I encourage anyone looking for an animal to adopt from a shelter and save a life!' Vonn urged

'I encourage 
anyone looking for an animal to adopt from a shelter and save a life!' she continued.

Vonn is widely regarded as the most successful female skier of all time, but a February 2013 knee injury while skiing in Austria has since seriously sidetracked her career.

Until last Tuesday, Vonn had remained upbeat nonetheless.

Less than two weeks after 
reconstructive right knee surgery in February 2013, she was already sounding a positive note, saying she was 'really looking forward to
 Sochi' and defending her Olympic downhill gold medal.

Along
 the way to the next Winter Games, though, Vonn began facing more 
setbacks.

As she'd move past one, another would surface. In the end, it 
was too much, even for Vonn, the most accomplished U.S. ski racer in 
history.

Expected to be one of the biggest stars at the upcoming Games, 
Vonn announced Tuesday — exactly one month before the opening ceremony —
 she won't be able to race in Russia

In a Facebook posting, Vonn said she is 'devastated' to miss the Olympics, 'but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level.'

Like many in her risk-filled sport, Vonn has dealt with injuries often, particularly at major events. She withdrew midway through the 2011 world championships because of a concussion.

She raced with a severely bruised shin at the last Olympics. She skipped a race at the 2009 worlds after slicing her thumb open on a champagne bottle.

She hurt her knee in training and missed a pair of races at the 2007 worlds. She took a scary fall during training at the 2006 Olympics, then left the hospital to compete.

'She's come back. She'll be back,' Vonn's father, Alan Kildow, said in a telephone interview. 'You'll see a lot of Lindsey Vonn in the future.'

Vonn left the 2010 Vancouver Games with two medals: the first Olympic downhill gold for an American woman, and a bronze in the super-G.

She is also a four-time overall World Cup champion, by far the most recognized name in Alpine skiing at the moment — and, as it happens, the girlfriend of Tiger Woods.

Add it all up, and she would have been the focus of plenty of media coverage in Sochi, certainly a main character in NBC's coverage for a U.S. audience.

'Lindsey gives you great promotional value, and she's an amazing athlete and an amazing story,' said Gary Zenkel, president of NBC Olympics.

'But there are amazing athletes that are going to be in Sochi, many of which we know, some of which we haven't identified yet.'

To those in the world of skiing, there's no doubt about the sport's most important athlete of late.

'Without Lindsey Vonn, the races are 
just not the same,' Canadian women's Alpine coach Hugues Ansermoz said 
last month.

'She just attracts so much interest. When Lindsey Vonn is 
here, there are more people coming to watch the race, there is more 
interest on TV, more journalists are interested.

And her relationship 
with Tiger Woods makes even more people interested.'

Painstaking: In March 2013 - skier Lindsey Vonn published this picture to Twitter that revealed the extent of her injury and subsequent surgery to fix the damage caused

But
 Vonn has rarely been present on the elite skiing circuit the past 12 
months. She tore two ligaments in her right knee and broke a bone in 
that leg during a high-speed crash at the world championships last 
February.

As Vonn 
neared a return, she re-tore her surgically repaired ACL in a crash 
during training in November.

After finishing 40th, 11th and fifth in a 
trio of World Cup races at Lake Louise, Alberta, in early December, Vonn
 sprained her MCL during a downhill at Val d'Isere, France, two weeks 
later.

'I did everything I possibly could to somehow get strong enough to overcome having no ACL,' Vonn said on Tuesday via her Facebook page.
