Sick: Paedophile David Bryant snatched four little girls from the street in the 1980s and 1990s and was jailed for 16 years

A paedophile who snatched four young girls off the street and sexually 
abused them was finally behind bars last night after an extraordinary 
DNA breakthrough, 30 years after his first attack.

David Bryant, 65, kidnapped the four girls, aged between three and five,
in the 1980s and 1990s and subjected them to horrific ordeals that 
lasted several hours.

Each of his victims was abducted in daylight as they played outside. Two were dumped, in tears and miles from home.

Bryant avoided justice for three decades, but after police arrested a 
relative in connection with an unrelated matter, they used pioneering 
DNA technology, called familial profiling, to positively link Bryant to 
the unsolved cases.

Yesterday he was jailed for 16 years at Newcastle Crown Court. Following
months of courtroom denials, he had changed his pleas to guilty at an 
earlier hearing. 

Bryant left his victims and their families ‘traumatised’ for 30 years. 

One victim, now in her thirties, told the court: ‘Since the incident, 
whenever I hear an ice-cream van I am left with chills all over my body.
It is exactly the same with woods and I avoid them at all costs.’ 

His catalogue of sickening crimes began in August 1982, when he snatched
a five-year-old girl from outside her home in Gosport, Hampshire, as 
she played with her brother and friends, the court heard.

When she 
reappeared, she told her mother how a man had lured her to an alleyway 
with the promise of sweets and had sexually assaulted her.

Less than a year later, Bryant snatched a three-year-old girl as she 
played near her home in Southampton, Hampshire. He took her to nearby 
woods and sexually abused her.

Bryant later moved to Saudi Arabia but returned in 1994 with a new 
partner and settled in Ulverston, Cumbria, where he worked as a taxi 
driver.

Cold case: Police in Newcastle search for evidence at the scene of one of Bryant's kidnappings, collecting DNA that eventually led to his conviction this year

Within a year he had kidnapped a five-year-old as she played outside her home in Blakelaw, Newcastle.

After subjecting her to an ordeal lasting more than three hours, Bryant dumped her miles away in the centre of Darlington.

Eventually, she was found by a taxi driver, wearing only her lilac 
anorak, white ankle socks and shoes. Four months later a four-year-old 
was abducted in Newcastle’s West End as she walked 90 yards from her 
home to her mother’s best friend.

The next day she was found knocking on a door in Darlington, telling the woman who answered: ‘I’ve lost my daddy.’

Officers kept a strain of DNA on file, taken from an item of clothing belonging to one of the girls.

When Bryant’s relative was arrested in May last year, they took his DNA 
and discovered a familial match. The relative was not charged with any 
offence. 

Bryant, who has previous convictions for sexual offences dating back to 
1975, was arrested and his DNA was found to be a perfect match.

Outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Steve Binks of Northumbria 
Police described the abductions as ‘every parent’s worst nightmare’. 

‘For 30 years, Bryant left these victims and their families traumatised 
by his despicable actions and has shown absolutely no remorse,’ he said.

‘With advances in DNA technology, and the joint work with Hampshire 
Police and the Forensic Science Service, this man was bound to be caught
eventually.’
