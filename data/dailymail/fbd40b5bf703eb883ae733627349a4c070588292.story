Mr Justice Holman ruled that - although the girl was under extreme duress and aged under 16 at the time - he was barred by statute from voiding the marriage

A judge says he cannot nullify the marriage of a teenage mother who says she was forced at 'gunpoint' into becoming a bride when she was just 14.

Instead the girl, now 17 and a mother of a one-year-old, must defy her family if she wants the union formally annulled, said Mr Justice Holman at the High Court.

The teenager, who was born in Britain and whose family has lived here for 40 years, says she was shipped out to Pakistan to contract a forced marriage with a 24-year-old man two years ago.

She told how she was subjected to 'harrowing' violence and menaced with a gun to go through with the ceremony - and was two weeks later forced to have sex with her ‘husband’, giving birth to his baby who is now aged just over one.

After she came forward with her account, her local authority took both her and her baby into care and asked Mr Justice Holman to formally declare that her marriage - which effectively made her a rape victim - could never have been recognised under English law.

However, in a unique decision, the judge ruled that - although the girl was under extreme duress and aged under 16 at the time - he was barred by statute from granting a declaration that her marriage was 'at its inception, void'.

Expressing sympathy for the girl and the 'real stigma' she faced, the judge said his hands were tied and he simply had no power to make a formal ruling that 'there never was a marriage' capable of recognition in England and Wales.

Despite the council’s plea that the girl should not be forced to take 'an active step' in defiance of her family, the judge said her only option was to launch court action herself, seeking nullification of her marriage.

Whether she wanted to take that course was 'her own decision', he told the court.

Mr Justice Holman said it was, according to the girl’s account, a 'grave example of a marriage which was forced under considerable duress, involving at one stage the production of a gun and physical violence upon the girl'.

Her father, who moved to the UK 40 years ago and has been a British citizen for three decades, and her older brother had accompanied her on the trip to Pakistan, which culminated in her becoming an unwilling bride.

The judge added: 'The marriage was consummated about two weeks later, after further threats to her if she did not permit her husband to have sexual intercourse with her.'

The girl’s barrister, Vanessa Meachin, said: 'She is the victim of forced marriage and rape. She is 17 and struggling with the complexities of the two sets of legal proceedings that she is already involved in.

'It is unrealistic to consider that she is presently equipped to proceed with a petition for nullity.'

Mr Justice Holman accepted that - as the girl was 'domiciled' in the UK; had been put under duress; and, most importantly, was under 16 at the time of the ceremony - the marriage was 'on the balance of probability, void' under English law.

However, he said he was prevented from making a solemn declaration to that effect by a section of the Family Law Act 1986, which states: 'No declaration may be made by any court...that a marriage was at its inception void'.

If he were to grant the declaration sought by the local authority, the judge said he would 'frankly, be bypassing the statutory prohibition by a mere device. I cannot do that and I am not prepared to do that'.

He added: 'I do understand and have sympathy with the point and position that it might be particularly defiant by the girl of her family for herself to initiate proceedings for a decree of nullity, although she now has little contact with most members of her family.

'The reality is that, sooner or later, she needs fully to resolve her legal status and to face up to the obviously necessary step of obtaining a decree of nullity.

'That, however, is a matter for her own decision, her own timing, and her own choice. For the reasons that I have now given, I simply refuse to make the order sought.'

The court earlier heard that the girl’s ‘husband’ was not named on her baby’s birth certificate and his whereabouts are unknown.

However, he still has the rights of a ‘putative or non-marital father’ and could conceivably play a part in the care proceedings.
