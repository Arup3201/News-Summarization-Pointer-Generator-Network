The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are beloved by the nation for bringing a modern touch to the ancient institution of the British monarchy.

Notoriously sensitive to the economic climate Kate has managed to remain a fashion icon while embracing the high street and often recycling her expensive gowns.

And true to form last night the Duchess stepped out in a stunning gown which she previously debuted back in October.

The 32-year-old last night wowed in the floor length ink blue gown at a black tie gala at the National Portrait Gallery - after having first worn it in October at a Kensington Palace dinner in aid of people with addictions.

Part of one of the Duchess’s favourite designers, Jenny Packham’s Autumn/Winter collection, the dress features a low, sweeping, heart-shaped neckline and chiffon off-the-shoulder sleeves.

The waist is accentuated with a contrasting black velvet belt and the skirt falls to the floor in soft pleats.

At a cost of £2,000 it is little wonder the frugal Duchess was keen to get another event out of the dress. 

Catherine added some serious sparkle to the dress last night at the Portrait Gala with the Nizam of Hyderabad necklace, on loan from the Queen

The Duchess kept her neckline unadorned when she first wore the dress to the 100 Women in Hedge Funds Fundraising gala held for charity Action on Addiction in October

The
 Nizam of Hyderabad asked the Queen to choose two pieces from Cartier to
 mark her wedding in 1947 - and the then Princess Elizabeth chose a tiara and a 
necklace based on an English rose.

The
 tiara was subsequently broken up to create other pieces but the 
necklace remains intact. The Queen wears it occasionally still today.

The Nizam of Hyderabad necklace was originally created by Cartier in 1930s.

It
 consists of a long chain of 38 diamonds (reduced from the original 46) 
with a diamond-encrusted snap. The centre of the necklace is pave-set 
with detachable double-drop pendant, 13 emerald-cut diamonds and a 
pear-shaped drop.

The original necklace consisted of eight double-drop and three triple-drop pendants.

However,
 nine of the pendants (all eight double-drop and the larger of the 
triple-drop pendants) were later removed and sold separately.

The necklace itself found its first owner in 1936 but Cartier repurchased it a year later.

Blending her thrifty sensibilities with a respect for the royal institution, Kate caused a stir last night by pairing the dress with a priceless diamond necklace on loan from the Queen. The Nizam of Hyderabad necklace was given to Her Majesty as a gift when she married in November 1947.

Perfectly displayed against the neckline of the dress, Kate’s jewels stole the show at the black tie Portrait Gala 2014 at The National Portrait Gallery.

The Nizam of Hyderabad necklace was originally created by Cartier in 1930s. It consists of a long chain of 38 diamonds (reduced from the original 46) with a diamond-encrusted snap. The centre of the necklace is pave-set with detachable double-drop pendant 13 emerald-cut diamonds and a pear-shaped drop.

However the Duchess has demonstrated the versatility of the gown when she wore it to more subtle effect just three months ago with minimal accessories.

Attending the dinner for one of her charities Action for Addiction days after Prince George’s christening she left her décolletage bare and wore just a single bracelet and simple diamond earrings.

She wore her hair down, with heavy eyeliner, blusher and nude lips to complete the elegant look.

The 100 Women in Hedge Funds (100WHF) philanthropic initiatives dinner raised money for the charity Action on Addiction, of which she is patron.

The Duchess has been slowly easing back into her royal duties, in particular supporting her personal charities, since the birth of Prince George last summer and will soon embark on an official visit to Australia with Prince William.
