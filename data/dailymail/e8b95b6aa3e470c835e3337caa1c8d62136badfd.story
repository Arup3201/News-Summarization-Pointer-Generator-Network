The bodies of two more women have been connected to alleged serial killer Darren Vann (pictured in an undated mugshot)

The bodies of two women found in an abandoned  building have been linked to an alleged serial killer charged in the strangulation deaths of two other women.

The coroner on Friday morning said DNA had identified the bodies found on October 19 last year as 53-year-old Sonya Billingsley and 27-year-old Tanya Gatlin. Both were from Gary, Indiana. 

Darren Vann is charged with murder in the deaths of 19-year-old Afrikka Hardy and 35-year-old Anith Jones. The 43-year-old Vann has pleaded not guilty.

Police said Hardy was killed at a Hammond motel and that Vann led investigators to the bodies of Jones and five other women inside abandoned houses in Gary.

No other charges have yet been filed.  

Vann, a convicted sex offender, was arrested on October 18 last year and charged with the strangulation death of Hardy.

Her body was found the day before in a bathtub at a Motel 6 in Hammond, 20 miles southeast of Chicago.

On October 22, he also was charged in the death of 35-year-old Anith Jones of Merrillville, Indiana, whose body was found in an abandoned house  in Gary.

Five more bodies were found on October 19 in other homes, said Hammond Police Chief John Doughty, who identified two of the women as Gary residents Teaira Batey, 28, and Kristine Williams, 36.

Some of the bodies have been difficult to identify because they were largely skeletonized so other markings, like identifying scars or birthmarks, weren't present.

Members of 17 different families have called the coroner's office inquiring about the bodies, and one call led to DNA tests on the third unidentified victim, Frey said in October.

Investigators in Indiana and Texas, where Vann also lived, have been poring over cold case files and missing person reports to determine if there are more victims.

Inquiries were also being made in Illinois. Hammond Police discovered information indicating Vann may have been in various communities just across the state line  in Cook County between the day Hardy's body was found and when Vann was arrested. 

Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart confirmed that 'through technology' investigators believed that Vann was in the area of Hazelcrest, Markham and Harvey then, but he wouldn't elaborate.

A law enforcement official close to the investigation said  cellphone records tracked Vann's phone through the region.

The official, who was not authorized to speak about the investigation and would only discuss it anonymously, said investigators were also informed Vann told detectives that after a killing he would visit abandoned buildings where he'd stashed previous victims to ensure bodies had not been discovered.

Vann was convicted in 2009 of raping a woman in his Austin, Texas, apartment. He was released from prison in 2013 and moved back to Indiana. 

Before that conviction, he served a year in prison in Indiana after he grabbed a Gary woman in a chokehold in 2004, doused her with gasoline and threatened to set her on fire. 

In both cases, the charges against Vann were reduced in plea bargains, and Texas officials deemed him a low risk for violence. 

Vann registered as a sex offender in Indiana and police made a routine check in September that he lived at the address he provided.

Sherriff Buncich said he wished registered sex offenders, like Vann, could be monitored more closely than they are but that budgetary and legal constraints make that difficult.
