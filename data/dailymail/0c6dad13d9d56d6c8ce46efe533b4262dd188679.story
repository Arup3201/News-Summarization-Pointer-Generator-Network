The title company executive who committed suicide with a nail gun in the wake of investigations into his alleged financial mismanagement had a $1 million life insurance policy that named his business as its beneficiary.

But the insurance company holding the policy says it learned after Richard Talley's death that the beneficiary had changed — from American Title Service, now in bankruptcy, to his wife, Cheryl Talley, who co-founded the company and was its majority owner.

It remains unclear ow close to the 56-year-old's suicide the switch was made.

However filings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court show that Talley had a $1 million policy with Transamerica Insurance Co. in which he named American Title as the recipient upon his death, The Denver Post reported.

Richard Talley, pictured with his wife of 25 years Cheryl, committed suicide with a nail gun at his home in Colorado on February 4. It has now emerged Talley's life insurance policy was transferred into his wife's name before he killed himself

'However, subsequent to Mr. Talley's death, Transamerica received notice of change of beneficiary to Cheryl Talley,' according to an inventory of American Title's personal property in a bankruptcy filing.

Transamerica was listed among the company's unsecured creditors, indicating the company was paying the premium.

American Title also listed the Denver Broncos, the Colorado Rockies, the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame, and Valley Country Club among 62 pages of unsecured creditors.

American Title filed for bankruptcy shortly after Talley was found dead in his Aurora home on Feb. 4, the result of six finishing nails fired into his chest and head from a nail gun.

The company on Thursday changed its bankruptcy filing to Chapter 7 liquidation, citing assets of just $100 and the $1 million life-insurance proceeds. 

Other assets might exist, but American Title's underwriter, Title Resource Guarantee Service in Texas, seized its bank accounts.

Mr Talley had allegedly been having trouble with his business before he took his own life in Colorado

The company's lawyer firm, hired to 'wind-down' its operation in bankruptcy, has said in court filings that it is unable to complete many of the required documents because they were confiscated by investigators.

The attorney general's office has refused to turn over any of more than 100 boxes of records it raided from American Title's headquarters in Greenwood Village last month.

Title Resource has alleged American Title's books were doctored to cover up about $2 million in missing funds, mostly escrow payments for real estate transactions.

Investigations have been launched by the Attorney General and the state division of insurance. 

Former employees of the company have also filed claims for missing retirement contributions, with several saying the matter is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor.
