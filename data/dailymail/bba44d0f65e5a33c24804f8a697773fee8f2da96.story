If you have ever travelled with Ryanair chances are that you have had a cause to grumble.

But while most disgruntled passengers only daydream about the ways they might grab the attention of the airline's customer service team, or its notorious boss Michael O'Leary, one rather angry, and very funny, newlywed from Hertfordshire is using social media to wreak his revenge.

This week a brilliantly angry complaint went viral after customer James Lockley posted an open letter to the budget airline via his Facebook page.

Is all PR good PR? A complaint to Ryanair posted on customer James Lockley's Facebook page has received more than 60,000 shares

James and his new wife had been on their way to a second wedding reception in Bratislava when motorway traffic and 'incompetent' Ryanair staff conspired to thwart their travel plans.

As James explains in his several hundred word post: 'We went straight to the Ryan Air assistant and explained our plight. She said we were still within the time and all would be fine but we had to make the attendant at check in aware and he would assist from there. 

'We approached the attendant as instructed and explained. Unfortunately, in the main part, due to him being a child, and forgetting to bring his mother to work, he heard only half of the words before his brain fell apart like a wet cake.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary recently promised that the airline had 'reinvented' itself to become more customer-focused

'He led us to the line for closing gates,
 advised we should wait and all would be ok. We stood patiently in the 
line for 20 minutes.

'We got to the front of the line and the lady, who 
we shall from this point refer to a Vacant, explained that she had 
literally just that second closed the flight and we had missed it.

'We 
complained that we had done as instructed and she said it was the 
child’s fault because he should have advised her that we were trying to 
board a closing flight and that because he hadn’t told her it was 
therefore our fault we had missed the plane.'

In a series of withering put-downs the groom introduces ''Vacant's' other colleagues as 'Not That Bright' and 'Middle Gimp' and goes on to explain in detail how all four characters spectacularly failed to live up to the new improved customer service levels that Ryanair have recently claimed to implement.

James continues: 'Middle Gimp had clearly listened hard at Ryanair Middle Gimp school as he managed to take two perfectly calm and sane adults and in a matter of seconds reduce them to angry people considering violence.

Tweet revenge: Some of the thousands of Twitter messages in support of James's complaint

"Check in opens 3 hours before the 
flight" he barked repeatedly as if it was the answer to every question 
in life. We tried to ask Middle Gimp direct questions about why it was 
necessary for us to miss the flight because the Child had forgotten to 
do his job, and Vacant had forgotten to do hers.

‘Why is this our fault, and why should we miss the flight because Ryan Air staff have admitted they made errors?.

‘Check in opens three hours before the flight’

‘Do
 you acknowledge we have just cause for complaint as we tried to do the 
right thing and the only reason we are not on the plane is because of 
communication failures with Ryan Air Staff?’

‘Check in opens three hours before the flight’

‘What colour are my trousers?’

‘Check in opens three hours before the flight’

‘Do you think economic sanctions on Russia will diffuse the escalating situation in Ukraine?’

‘Check in opens three hours before the flight’

‘Were Man Utd right to fire David Moyes?’

‘Check in opens three hours before the flight’

‘My tinkle is hurting, could you take a look if I promise not to tell anyone?’

‘Check in opens three hours before the flight."'

Under fire: The complaint about the budget airline has gone viral on Facebook

The open letter was posted on Facebook on April 24 and within days had garnered thousands of 'shares' on the social networking site.

On April 26 James posted a Facebook status update saying: 'Staggered, over 6000 shares now for my Ryanair 
story. Unreal, flattered and really pleased I have made some people 
laugh. Thank you for all the emails and messages to show support and to 
say it made you laugh, really appreciate it.'

One week on and the post has been shared over 60,000 times and is a hot topic on Twitter as James awaits a response from the airline.

James estimates that the experience has cost him £220 for new flights, £79 for a hotel, £50 for taxis to and from the airport and £35 for 'the world's most expensive sandwich' plus stress, inconvenience and an angry wife.

He summarised his customer services experience by saying: 'So, thank you Ryan Air for a comfortable and enjoyable experience. I 
have watched a program called the news so I fully expect this to land on
 the desk of the customer services team underneath the empty bottles and
 sandwich wrappers that you also file there.

'You treated us badly, you 
cost us money and made us miss our wedding reception through a display 
of incompetence I have not seen since Greece was allowed to have money 
and a cheque book.'

Robin Kiely, Head of Communications at Ryanair told MailOnline: 'We are aware of Mr Lockley’s complaint and have contacted him directly to address these issues.'
