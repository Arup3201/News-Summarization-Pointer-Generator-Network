Paramedics were called to her home in Prince George's County to treat two unconscious children at around 2am on Sunday.

The pair were both taken to Children's Hospital in Washington, where they died a few hours later.

Police say the mother waved her Miranda rights today and gave a very detailed statement of what occurred when she suffocated them.

Today there were reports that the mother of two had been taken in for an emergency psychiatric evaluation last week - authorities are still trying to establish a motive.

Both fathers of the children have been notified of their deaths.  

According to WTOP, court records show Spoon was involved in a lengthy custody battle with Lester Thompson, the father of her eldest child.

It stated records filed in Calvert County show Spoon demanded a paternity test in February which showed he was the biological father.

Court records also show Spoon refused to sign a custody agreement in May and then was then granted primary custody.

Thompson was ordered to child support and was told he could spend time with his daughter for a handful of days each month.

He wrote on Facebook: 'Going to pick up my daughter today and I am so happy to spend some time with her.'

According to her Twitter profile, Spoon was adopted from Russia and brought to the United States when she was three-years-old.

She posted several photos of her children on the social networking site who she called 'my world.' 

Her last post on August 20 was a photo of her with Kayla which she titled 'My love.' 

Neighbors in Chesapeake Beach said that Spoon had moved in with her parents recently and they said they have seen young children around the house.

Spoon's parents, Gary and Paivi Spoon were not home at the time.   

Neighbors told the Washington Post that the Spoon's were looking to renovate their home and were letting Sonya live their while work continued.

One neighbor who didn't wish to be identified said to CBS Baltimore: 'My two oldest woke me up when they noticed all the flashing lights from the police cars and ambulances that were out here,' one neighbor who didn't wish to be identified said to CBS Baltimore.

'They kind of made a big commotion because they saw one of the children being brought out.'

A neighbor, Angela Pryor told the Washington Post that the killings had made her feel uncomfortable.

'You feel so safe living right across from the police,' she said. 'This seems very strange for this neighborhood.' 

Detective Bernard Jones underlined the fact that the murders were an isolated incident and there is 'no need for the community to be afraid.' 

'We are all saddened by this tragic event. The loss of two children that were so young tugs at our hearts. As the police investigate this horrible case, our thoughts and prayers are with the family and the people of the Cheverly community as they try to reconcile how and why this happened,' said Prince George's County Executive Rushern L. Baker III, in a statement Sunday. 

Spoon will remain in police custody pending trial.
