Brutal: The supervisor's arm can be seen to make contact with the intern's head as he launches his attack

The Ministry of Manpower said it has also been alerted over alleged abuse in the workplace.

The video entitled 'Singapore office bully' was first uploaded to the video-sharing website YouTube on May 18 and already has more than 17,000 views.

The recording shows the boss slap a 29-year-old intern before a fellow employee intervenes.

But when the other worker walks away, the supervisor van be seen to strike the intern another three times. 

A fellow intern who filmed the video said in a posting on an online forum that he had noticed the supervisor 'constantly bullying' his co-worker soon after starting his internship.

He claims that when he confronted his boss, the supervisor explained that 'there is a story behind' the abuse.

Teaching a lesson: The supervisor claimed he was trying to overcome the intern's inferiority complex

'He said that my colleague apparently has an inferiority complex and apparently my supervisor is trying to 'nurture' him to get over it,' he said.

'I felt this was stupid, as how can you nurture someone by hitting them? My co-worker is very timid and seems like the kind of guy that will not stand up for himself.'

The Straits Times reported today that after the video went viral, two former interns in the same company also came out to say they had worked in fear under the supervisor.

Local Chinese-language newspaper Shin Min said the intern, a university graduate, was being paid Sg$500 ($400) a month and that his parents may seek compensation from the firm.
