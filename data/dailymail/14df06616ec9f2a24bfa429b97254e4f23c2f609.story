Neither Arjen Robben nor Robin van Persie could get past Costa Rica's deep defence in Salvador as Holland's two key threats suffered without being able to show their usual counter attacking talents.

And in the end, after failing to break down the tournament's surprise package, it came down to penalties. Both dispatched their spot kicks and then Tim Krul played hero from the bench to send the Dutch through.

Robben might have made a renewed effort to stay on his feet after talk about his diving dominated the post match coverage following the 2-1 win over Nigeria, but he needn't have - Costa Rica constantly kicked him as they tried to stop his attacking runs by hook or by crook.

Relief: Robben and Robin enjoy their shootout win after a tough game against Costa Rica

At last! Van Persie finally gets the ball past Navas - from the spot in the penalty shoot out

Me too: And Robben confidently dispatched his into the top corner

No! Van Persie couldn't believe his lack of luck as chance after chance went begging

Tough night: Robben was kicked all over the place as he struggled to make an impact in Salvador

Thwarted: Kaylor Navas so often stopped Van Persie during normal and extra time

Van Persie was unlucky with his finishing on multiple occasions.

It was a frustrating night for the Dutch - and none moreso than their two top scorers. Both Van Persie and Robben have thrived on the counter attack in this World Cup so far but Costa Rica's defensive solidity rarely allowed them to take that sort of opportunity.

In the first half's one occasion where they were able to break with pace, their opponents found another solution: bringing Robben down with a cynical challenge as he tried to break into their half.

Van Persie did have one decent effort at goal but it was easily saved by the excellent Keylor Navas. Something had to change.

But it didn't - the second half looked to be going even worse from the off. Costa Rica became even more willing to sit deep and frustrate their illustrious opponents.

Manager Louis van Gaal kept both of his danger men on - unlike against Nigeria - and threw on reinforcements but still neither man was really firing.

Robben still caused problems for the defence but he was often brought down by challenges designed to stop him in his tracks - no need to dive this time.

Van Persie could have won it with two minutes left but missed the ball to waste a gilt-edged chance.

But by the time the whistle blew for the end of normal time the Manchester United man must have been seriously cursing his luck after his shot was cleared onto the crossbar by Yeltsin Tejeda's misskick off the line.

As a pairing - they had no luck. Two extra time shots from Robben were deflected away from goal by Van Persie, it just did not seem to be their night.

And so to penalties. Van Persie then Robben both dispatched theirs, with Tim Krul saving twice to get Holland through.

Both forwards will be hoping the luck that only joined their side for penalties will continue into the semi final against Argentina and beyond.

8 minutes: Robben goes on a dangerous charge down the right flank but Giancarlo Gonzalez puts a stop to him on the byline.

21 minutes: Van Persie has a great chance but he fires it with power straight at Keylor Navas who palms it away.

24 minutes: Robben runs at the Costa Rican defence and plays the ball wide to Dirk Kuyt who finds Van Persie but he's offside.

28 minutes: It's Van Persie's turn to run at Costa Rica's back five before playing it to Memphis Depay to shoot.

34 minutes: Robben leads a rare Holland counter but he is scythed down as he breaks into the opposition half.

41 minutes: The Bayern Munich winger slips Van Persie in but Navas comes and claims the ball ahead of him.

51 minutes: Robben has been staying on his feet so far but he justifiably goes down after being brought down by Junior Diaz and Michael Umana together. The latter goes into the book.

55 minutes: The winger pokes a ball through to Van Persie after considering his options on the right hand side. The recipient can't quite make up his mind what to do but he wins a corner.

80 minutes: Robben is dragged down by Gonzalez just outside the area and he took earns himself a booking.

83 minutes: Van Persie doesn't appear to be having any luck - the brilliant Navas denies him again.

88 minutes: Wesley Sneijder calls in a brilliant ball and Van Persie just has to get a touch to convert it but he completely misses the ball and the chance is gone. The best chance of the game.

90 minutes: Robben breaks past Diaz who again fouls him. He should see red but gets away with it.

91 minutes: First Van Persie hits his free kick straight at Navas, then his drive at the back post is cleared off the line and onto the crossbar by Yeltsin Tejeda - somehow the ball doesn't go in.

101 minutes: Robben is still full of steam and he runs down the right, cuts in but has his shot blocked. He ends up on the ball again and this time it's blocked by Riaz - the referee deems it to be his arm and gives another free kick.

106 minutes: Another way to stop Robben - Johnny Acosta goes in for the challenge on the Dutch right wing and it ends up with a clash of heads which brings Robben crashing to the ground for yet another free kick.

116 minutes: Robben sees his chance to win it cutting in from the right and ignores Van Persie and Klass-Jan Huntelaar in the box. In the end his shot actually hits Van Persie.

118 minutes: Sneijder hits the bar, it comes back to Robben but again his shot hits Van Persie!

Van Persie's penalty: He goes low to the right and it just evades Navas' dive to nestle in the corner of the net.

Robben's penalty: Sends Tim Krul the wrong way by thrashing his penalty confidently into the top left hand corner.

Tricky: Robben makes one of his trademark runs, bursting past the Costa Rican back line

Hot shot: Van Persie fires in an effort in the first half that is saved by Keylor Navas

Hard work: Robben took a few kicks from the Costa Ricans as they tried to neutralise the danger

Marked man: Costa Rica's Junior Diaz and Giancarlo Gonzalez give Van Persie no room to move
