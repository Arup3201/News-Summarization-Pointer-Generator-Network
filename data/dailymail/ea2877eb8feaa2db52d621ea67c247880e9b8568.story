More than 20 years after their bitter divorce, Steven Hawking has paid tribute to his first wife who saved him from what he calls the darkest time in his life.

In a new documentary about his life, Professor Hawking highlights his former wife, Jane Wilde, as his saviour from depression after he was diagnosed with the motor neurone disease in 1963.

Written and narrated by the scientist himself, the film, Hawking, documents the fascinating life of the famous physicist. Scroll down for video

Stephen Hawking pays tribute to his former wife, Jane Wilde, in the film by highlighting how she saved him from depression

Ms Wilde is interviewed as part of the film, and talks freely and openly about the challenges of living with the debilitating disease which affected her husband's personality as well as his body.

She is also credited with saving her former husband's life after refusing to switch off his life-support machine when he suffered a severe attack of pneumonia in 1985.

Before
their separation in 1991, she had cared for the scientist in addition to 
raising the couple's three children. Her interview in the documentary sheds light on the challenges and pressures of such responsibility.

The film also features Mr Hawking's sister and several students and carers.

Professor Hawking was married to his first wife for  
26 years before their marriage was torn apart by a whirlwind of fame and
fortune after the success of his book, A Brief History 
of Time.

In the film, Mrs Hawking reveals how her former husband's illness forced them into their own ‘black hole’ of despair.

Jane Wilde cared for her former husband Stephen as well as the couple's children for many years with the famous scientist refusing outside help

She says: ‘It got rather too much for me to cope with. We ceased to be happy as before,' adding that there were 'two faces to Stephen.' 

‘One was the public wunderkind who had
overcome motor neurone and was travelling the world. The other was our 
home situation where his illness forced us into our own black hole.’

Prof Hawking, 71, met Miss Wilde while
studying at Cambridge when he was 21. Soon afterwards he was diagnosed 
with motor neurone disease – a condition which has left him 
wheelchair-bound for almost half a century and able to communicate only 
through a voice synthesiser operated by a muscle in his cheek.

Prof Hawking describes how he became 
so desperately ill with pneumonia while he wrote A Brief History of Time
that doctors offered his wife the chance to end his misery and turn off
his life-support machine. But Miss Wilde refused to do so and her 
husband went on to complete the bestselling book which has sold 10 
million copies in 40 languages.

Prof Hawking describes the near-death 
experience in 1985 as the ‘darkest’ time of his life and explains how it
was the treatment for this illness which left him unable to speak.

He said: ‘It was very serious and I was put into a drug-induced coma and then on life-support.

Prof Hawking suffered a near fatal pneumonia attack in Switzerland, and only survived after his former wife refused to turn off life support. He went on to write the revolutionary book, A Brief History of Time which sold millions of copies worldwide

'The doctors thought I was so far gone that they offered Jane [the option] to turn off the machine.’

But she refused and ordered doctors to fly her husband, who was in Geneva when he fell ill, back to their home in Cambridge.

He added: ‘Slowly the drugs worked, though a small incision in my throat robbed me of my ability to talk.’

In the film, Miss Wilde describes the 
early days of their relationship, saying: ‘I was drawn to his very wide 
smile and beautiful grey eyes. He  was great fun and we were together 
going to defy the disease and the doctors.’

A Brief History of Time was finished 
in 1987 and Prof Hawking had become famous around the world, but the 
fame – coupled with his ill health – led to the collapse of his 
marriage.

Prof Hawking married his former nurse, Elaine Mason, in 1995. They divorced in 2006.

He describes his second marriage as 
‘passionate and tempestuous’, but dismisses allegations that he suffered
physical abuse at his wife’s hands.

Life expectancy for motor neurone 
disease sufferers is about five years, but Prof Hawking says he is not 
afraid of dying. He added: ‘Every day could be my last and, though I’m 
71 now, I go to work every day. I have a desire to make the most of 
every minute.’

The film will open Cambridge Film Festival on September 19, and will be released nationwide the following day.
