This is the shocking moment an elderly woman sparked mayhem on the roads after driving along a busy dual carriageway at 50mph in the wrong direction.

Terrified drivers were forced to take 
evasive action to avoid ploughing into the unidentified woman's red Citroen as it sped towards oncoming traffic along the A11 and A14 roads in Cambridgeshire.

Thankfully Cambridgeshire Police were able to set up a road block to stop the woman, who they said was suffering from mental health issues, before anybody was hurt.

Terrifiying: Drivers were forced to take evasive action to avoid ploughing into the unidentified woman's red Citroen as it sped towards oncoming traffic along the A11 and A14 roads in Cambridgeshire

The shocking incident was captured on video by Tom Hind, 40, who watched in horror from the back seat of a vehicle driving along the same road, only in the right direction.

Mr Hind, a piano technician from Hornchurch, East London, dialled 999 as soon as he saw the woman travelling at high speed along the busy dual carriageway.

He says police told him they had already been swamped with calls over the incident.

Mr Hind said: 'I saw someone driving the wrong way and it took me a minute to process what was actually happening.'

'It was quite startling and I immediately called the police and they said they'd been inundated with calls from people telling them someone was driving the wrong way at speed,' he added.Â

A spokesperson for Cambridgeshire Police confirmed the woman was spoken to by officers, but said it was later decided not to be in the public interest to press charges

Mr Hind says it was at this point that he took out his camera and began filming.

Throughout the clip, a number of cars travelling in the opposite direction can be seen swerving out of the woman's way, while others flash their headlights to try to get her to stop.

Mr Hind said: 'They must have been going for about 10 or 15 miles. It's an absolute miracle that no-one was hurt.'

'I could see cars pulling out of the way as the driver was on the outside lane...The driver was eventually stopped by police in the same lane.'

Mr Hind says the woman eventually came to a 'huge' road block and thankfully slowed down in time to avoid ploughing into it.

He described the fact nobody was hurt as 'miraculous'.

A spokesperson for Cambridgeshire Police told MailOnline that the woman was spoken to by officers, but said it was later decided not to be in the public interest to press charges.

They said that they had reported the woman to the DVLA however, and confirmed that her vehicle has been impounded.
