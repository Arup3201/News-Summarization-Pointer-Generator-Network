The uncle and aunt of a 2-year-old boy who is believed to have shot himself in Stone Mountain, Georgia, have been charged with child cruelty and reckless conduct in connection with his death.

The body of Kamarri ‘Cutty’ Lewis was discovered shortly after 10am on Monday morning. He died from a single gunshot wound.

The boy’s aunt, Alexia Thomas, 23, was supposed to be watching the child while the mother was at work, but has admitted to police that she was asleep.

'I've never seen a weapon inside the home,' Thomas told police, reports CBS46. 'I don't know how to respond. I'm still in shock. This is crazy. I don't know how to respond.'

She has been arrested along with the boy’s uncle Detray Shivers, 25.

They have also been charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. 

Shiver has also been charged with tampering with evidence after police found the gun - a semi-automatic pistol - in a storm drain outside the house.

Police said Shiver threw the gun in the storm drain.

Both Thomas and Shivers are in the DeKalb County jail.

Homicide charges may be added if detectives determine through gun powder residue and bullet trajectory tests that the gunshot was not self-inflicted.

'They say they found the child shot,' police Captain Stephen Fore told The Atlanta Journal Constitution. 'The child may have shot himself.'
