Once relatively thin, the ‘Butcher of Brooklyn’ has bulked up whilst at Rikers.

Levi Aron, who is accused of slaughtering and dismembering 8-year-old Leiby Kletzky after giving him a ride in a Hasidic neighbourhood in Brooklyn last year, has ballooned out considerably, adding at least 50 pounds to his 5ft8 frame.

He has also grown a full beard during his time behind bars, looking almost unrecognizable from the grim-faced arrested last year.

Heavy matters: Levi Aron, the confessed killer of an 8-year-old Hasidic boy, has gained a significant amount of weight while in jail at Rikers

Tragic: Leiby Kletzky, 8, asked Aron for directions home on July 11, 2011, and was then brutally murdered and mutilated

Aron was last seen in court in March looking relatively thin, but made a video appearance from Rikers Island today looking bloated.

A lawyer in the courtroom during Aron’s video appearance quipped: ‘He’s definitely not working out,’ according to the New York Post.

In the video, Aron is seen in a dark, long-sleeved shirt, wearing a wristwatch and a yarmulke, reclined slightly and with his gut protruding.

Aron’s defence lawyers said in court last year that their client suffered from psychotic disorders, and he was placed on suicide watch.

He is next scheduled to appear in court July 27.

Last July, Leiby got lost on his walk home from a religious day camp - called yeshiva - and asked Aron, whom he met on the street, for help.

It was the first time the little boy was allowed to walk alone, and he was supposed to travel seven blocks to meet his mother but missed a turn.

Aron, a hardware supply store clerk, took the boy home and when they returned, they watched TV before the boy fell asleep, police said.

He remained there the next day when Aron went to work, and the disappearance sparked a major search effort in his insular community, which teaches its children to be wary of the secular world and avoid interactions with strangers.

Saying goodbye: The close-knit Hasidic community said goodbye to the boy in a funeral in Borough Park on July 13, 2011; the crime rocked the Jewish sect to the core

The boy's picture was plastered on light posts around the area. ‘When I saw the fliers, I was panicky and afraid,’  Aron explained, according to police.

Aron told detectives his victim put up a struggle and that afterward he was hearing voices telling him ‘to take his own life for what he did’

Aron allegedly carved up the body with knives and disposed of body parts, including severed feet found wrapped in plastic his freezer.

The rest of the boy's body was discovered in bags inside a red suitcase in a trash bin. His legs had been cut from his torso.

According to the New York Daily News, this was the first case since the 1979 disappearance of Etan Patz to occur in New York City.

Patz’s alleged killer was charged with second degree murder Friday night.
