A series of photos have emerged from the ultra-secretive Abu Dhabi set of Star Wars: Episode VII and although none of the franchise’s big stars put in an appearance, the pictures offer some encouraging first signs of what fans can expect from the new movie.

Director J.J. Abrams began shooting the highly anticipated film last month and while little is known about the script, the photos suggest a back to basics style to filming, shunning the unpopular CGI-heavy approach of George Lucas’ prequels.

The photos reveal many encouraging signs for fans of the original trilogy. Abu Dhabi is believed to be a stand-in for the desert planet of Tatooine, Luke Skywalker’s home planet.

Extras pose for the camera on the set of Star Wars: Episode VII during filming in Abu Dhabi

Taking the production to Abu Dhabi marked a move away from the original desert locations used in the first six Star Wars installments

The impression made by the collection of photos is of a world eerily familiar to fans of the previous films, in particular Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope when we are first introduced to Luke Skywalker.

What should be especially exciting to a lot of fans of the original trilogy is the amount of practical effects that can be seen in the photos, rather than the all-green screen ‘sets’ of the prequel movies which proved unpopular with actors and audiences alike.

A crew of 600 descended on Abu Dhabi last month and started to construct the sets on a site closely guarded by security services. Filming has since been completed in the desert and filming has moved to stages in London.
