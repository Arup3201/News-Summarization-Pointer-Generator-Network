Australia was on the verge of announcing it had its own Loch Ness monster after strange S-shape and loop shape formations were spotted by a weather bureau radar off the west Australian coast.

The unusual images sparked a frenzy of rumour online with some weather groups dubbing the initial 80km-wide formation the Rottnest monster, as it appeared off Rottnest Island.

Speculation mounted after a second shape was spotted today, adding to the intrigue.

The loop-shaped formation added to speculation there was a Loch Ness-type creature living off the West Australian coast

However, the mystery was finally resolved this afternoon after the Department of Defence revealed that the formation was actually related to the navy testing a ship system in the area.

'The unusual pattern that appeared on the Bureau of Meteorology's Perth weather radar on Wednesday 12, was the result of a Defence exercise off the west Australian Coast,' a Defence spokesman said

'The exercise is a regular training activity involving ships and aircraft, that is designed to prepare a Navy warship for an operational deployment. This exercise is ongoing.

'The environmental conditions over the west Australian coast at the time of the activity provided a unique opportunity for this routine activity to be visible on the weather radar display.'

WA Weather Group administrator Sean Gray, 39, said he had hoped the formations were a sign of another life form such as a Loch Ness monster-type creature.

'The explanation totally ruined it - the mystery is over,' he said. 'I think if there's going to be a rumour, let's give it a name and make it a Rott Nest monster. It would be great for tourism and could get tours going.'

Mr Gray said people had seen navy activity in the area, but he did not believe this caused the formation. 'The thing that got everybody was how long it lingered on the radar and moved in the wind,' he said. 'It was slow moving, it was slower moving than an aircraft dumping fuel but too fast for a helicopter. The innuendo going around is not based on science.'

Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist Rabi Rivett had said there was no explanation for the giant shape, but used a process of elimination to ruling out some causes.

'It's nothing meteorological. It's not a cloud, radars don't pick up clouds, that's not what they're for.'

He said military chaff had also been ruled out. 'Sometimes military with the chaff can cause different formations, but the fact it maintained its shape as it moved north-west rules that out,' he said.

'If it was military-related they did a very good job of flying that signature in a very short period of time,' he said. 'It didn't change shape as it moved - caught in the wind it would have changed.'

WA Weather Group spokesperson Peter Coe, 19, said the formation had caused confusion among weather enthusiasts. 'It could be something like a Loch Ness monster, but that wouldn't show up on a radar,' he said.

Mr Coe has been part of the weather enthusiast group, based in Perth, since 2010 and said he had never seen anything like the formation before. 'That particular shape sparked a lot of interest - it's a bit unusual,' he said.
