A spiritual healer accused of sexually molesting women told a court his victims thought he was touching them because of a phenomenon known as ‘phantom hands.’ 

George Boak said clients would get the sensation of feeling his hands inside them when they would really be just above their body.

The 70-year-old grandfather said he had been a ‘Christian healer’ for 25 years and had the ability to send his healing powers to patients from miles away.

Boak has gone on trial at Bradford Crown Court for groping and assaulting three women who went to him for pain relief.

He accepted that he sexually touched one patient, but claimed he responded to an invitation from her to be ‘familiar.’ He stopped immediately when she asked what he was doing.

‘I apologised because I realised I had misread the signs,’ he told the jury.

The two other women may have thought he was touching them intimately when he wasn’t, the court heard.

‘From the healing you get all sorts of sensations...you could feel my hands inside you and they might be two inches above the body,’ he said.

But prosecutor Michael Smith submitted that his claims about ‘phantom hands’ were a lie.

‘No it’s not a lie it’s well-documented is phantom hands,’ said Boak.

Mr Smith said his claim showed an ‘inability’ to face up to what he had done.

The woman who reported him to police last year told the court he was the only person who could ease the chronic back pain she had suffered for years, but she felt uncomfortable about some of the remarks he made to her.

She said Boak would tell her how attractive she was, but she stopped going for healing sessions at his home because of the comments.

The patient returned out of ‘sheer desperation’ because of the pain.

The woman described how Boak put his hand inside her bra during an alleged sexual assault last year.

‘I dragged his hand out really quickly and within seconds he’s got his hand down my leggings,’ he told the jury.

She said she managed to get up and ‘hobble’ out of the house and then contacted the police.

Another patient came forward when she read about Boak appearing in court in the local paper.

She alleged Boak molested her several years ago and ‘froze’ when she read the article.

‘It felt really horrible. It just brought it all back and I thought I need to help this lady.’

She told the jury she had not consented to Boak touching her sexually and said she did not know either of the two other complainants involved in the case.

A third complainant has alleged Boak sexually assaulted her while she was naked and even kissed her breasts.

The woman asked him: ‘George what are you doing?’ and he replied: ‘Sorry, I got carried away.’

Boak, a former traffic warden from Halifax, West Yorkshire, has denied two charges of sexual assault and one of indecent assault.

The trial continues.
