Chris Eubank Jnr battered Dmitry Chudinov from pillar to post before the referee belatedly stepped in to end the Russian's brutal punishment with less than a minute of the final round remaining.

Fighting for the first time since losing to Billy Joe Saunders last November, Eubank delivered the perfect response and is also winning over the British crowd.

He dominated from the first bell and it was a miracle that Chudinov remained standing for as long as he did - but only the official will know why he didn't spare him earlier.

Ironically, the fight was almost scrapped an hour before the fighters were due to make their entrance when Chudinov's camp complained about the appointment of British referee Terry O'Connor.

The issue was resolved at the death when Sweden's Mikael Hook stepped in but one imagines Mr O'Connor would have been less hesitant.

A fast start by Eubank left his opponent, who held the WBA interim middleweight world title, with a cut over his right eye by the start of the second round. Eubank switched comfortably from boxing at range to working on the inside but was also guilty of excessive holding.

The Russian had shown in the early stages that he was prepared to fight fire with fire but he was unable to string his punches together in response to Eubank's bludgeoning blows.

By the fifth session, Eubank sensed a stoppage was possible but he would soon learn the visiting man would not go without a tear-up.

Chudinov was something of a sitting duck by the seventh round as Eubank picked him off with ease, forcing the doctor to check on the injured eye before the start of the eighth. And by the ninth, blood was coming from cuts on either side of his face, yet still he stood defiant.

Only he will know how he survived the next two stanzas but finally, with 49 seconds left on the clock, Eubank delivered one final, bruising barrage before Chudinov was rescued from his plight. 

'It was a great fight,' Eubank said. 'Hats off to Chudinov, I don't think I've ever hit someone so many times and he hasn't gone down.

'I'm surprised the referee didn't stop it [sooner].'
