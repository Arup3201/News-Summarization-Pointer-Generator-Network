Tasteless: DJ Chris Evans has courted controversy after impersonating serial sex predator Jimmy Savile live on air to nearly 10 million listeners

DJ Chris Evans has courted controversy after impersonating serial sex predator Jimmy Savile live on air to nearly 10 million listeners. 

The Radio 2 Breakfast Show host reeled off a string of the disgraced BBC television presenter's catchphrases, including 'Now then, now then' and 'How's about that then'.

He imitated Savile's distinctive drawl and claimed the paedophile sounded like singer Jessie J.

He was stopped mid-routine by his stunned producer who quickly jumped in, saying: 'We've never needed to move on more urgently.'

Savile abused hundreds of young people from 1955 to 2009, with many of his victims still alive today

Last month, it was reported that the BBC could be forced to pay up to £4million in total compensation to 120 of his victims.

Evans, 47, kicked off his tasteless impression about two hours into his popular morning show after playing Sparks' 70s hit This Town Ain't Big Enough For Both Of Us.

He claimed the American band's lead singer Russell Mael had a 'clenched-teeth' and 'overly taut-necked' style of singing - saying it was 'on the way' to David Bowie, but sounded more like Jessie.

He then indicated that the 25-year-old's Price Tag singer's voice sounded like Savile's.

Shockingly, he impersonated the sex predator while singing along to Jessie's hit Stand Up -  mumbling some of his most notorious catchphrases, including 'Now then, now then' and 'How's about that then'.

'That sounds like someone else whose name conveniently escapes me at the moment,' he joked.

The Chris Evans Breakfast show attracts 9.75 million listeners - well above its 8.95 million average this time last year - according to the latest round of audience ratings from Rajar.

It isn't the first time the DJ has courted controversy as a radio host.

In 1996, Radio 1 was forced to apologise after Evans made tasteless jokes about Anne Frank and the Holocaust.

BBC Radio 2 has refused to comment.
