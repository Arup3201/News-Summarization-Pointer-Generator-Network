Madame Tussauds London has just revealed its newest figure: heroine of The Hunger Games' franchise, Katniss Everdeen.

Complete with its own immersive backdrop, the wax replica of the film's protagonist portrays Katniss in her signature hunting outfit, which she wears in the series' second installment, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. 

This reveal follows November's cinematic release of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, the third film in the series.

Katniss, who is played by Academy Award-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence, also has wax likenesses at Madame Tussaud's New York and Hollywood locations.

In London, Katniss is clad in her iconic brown leather hunting jacket, dark charcoal trousers, knee-length tie-up leather boots and is toting her arrow bag and trademark bow - the same look she sported in the first several minutes of Catching Fire, while out hunting with Gale (Liam Hemsworth).

Her hair is also styled in her infamous side-swept braid, which later becomes a symbol of the revolution.
