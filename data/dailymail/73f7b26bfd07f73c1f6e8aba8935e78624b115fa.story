The KNVB confirmed the news in an official statement which said: 'Rafael van der Vaart will miss the World Cup in the Brazil. The Holland international has a calf strain in his right leg.

'Coach Louis van Gaal has therefore decided not to include him in the final selection.'

Former Tottenham and Real Madrid man Van der Vaart, has 109 caps for Holland and has scored 25 goals as well as helping them reach the 2010 World Cup final in South Africa where they lost 1-0 to Spain.

Van der Vaart was the most experienced player in the Dutch preliminary squad, but had already suffered an illness prior to his injury as he struggled to press his claim for inclusion in the final 23-man party which will be named on Saturday.

The injury will come as a particular blow for the veteran after he recently told Dutch television station NOS about leaving his troubles at club level behind to enjoy playing for the national team.

He said: 'It feels like such a relief after such a season with Hamburg.

'If you come to the national team, the level is higher and there players there who have won titles.

'That's why the mood is so positive, I feel really comfortable here.'

Van der Vaart's absence will also be a blow to Van Gaal after he assisted six goals for Hamburg during the 2013-14 campaign, the highest of any Dutchman in Europe's top five leagues.

Van der Vaart is part of a band of experienced players in a young Holland squad alongside Manchester United striker Robin van Persie, Galatasaray's Wesley Sneijder and former Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt.
