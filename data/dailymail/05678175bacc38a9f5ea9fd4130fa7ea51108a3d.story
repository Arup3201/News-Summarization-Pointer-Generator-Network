The skies finally broke halfway through his match on Monday, forcing Andy Murray back to the locker room for a shower and a change of kit.

Only after doing that could he step outside into the corridor and speak to his coach Amelie Mauresmo about how things were going in his fourth-round match against South African giant Kevin Anderson.

That, it turned out, was about the only inconvenience of the day as his Wimbledon title defence continues to fall into place. Everything else is going swimmingly after a superbly skilled 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 victory over the world No 18.

The watching Sir Alex Ferguson, with 
whom he consulted after the match rather than during it, will have been 
among those hugely impressed by the way he tackled a 6ft 8in opponent 
who can turn a tennis court into something akin to a coconut shy.

It
 was, for the first time in this tournament, a proper test both without
 the roof and under it, with a useful taste of tension thrown in as 
Anderson forced a set point before the tiebreak was clinched 8-6.

Murray’s day could only have been improved had his next obstacle, the 
exciting young Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, had his fourth-round tie held 
over by largely unexpected rain that has created havoc with the 
schedule.

It was not, and 
now Wimbledon has the quarter-final tomorrow it had eagerly hoped for: 
the defending champion in sublime form against the hugely-gifted 
23-year-old, long identified as the man who can break up the Big Four’s 
domination.

Murray looks in
 no state to cede his place at the top table, but is aware of the threat
 he faces: ‘He’s starting to come into his prime, he’s won a lot of 
matches this year,’ said the third seed, who came close to employing the
 Bulgarian’s coach, Roger Rasheed, before appointing Ivan Lendl at the 
end of 2011.

‘Grigor’s a 
more mature player now and makes better decisions on the court than he 
used to. He has a lot of variety in his game and sometimes it takes time
 to know how to use that — he’s starting to do it now.”

Yesterday’s
 match became tougher after the roof was closed at 3-0 in the second 
set, although Murray was not complaining about it not being shut from 
the start.

‘They should 
always try to play first with it open because this is an outdoor event. I
 started off a bit tentative when we came back  out and he hit the ball 
cleaner  but I still did well and created loads of chances.’

If
 it is the first Wednesday of July then it must be Murray in the 
Wimbledon quarter-finals, as this is his seventh consecutive progression
 to the last eight, emblematic of his admirable consistency at the Grand
 Slams.

Rivals such as 
Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer face back-to-back matches starting today,
 while Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka has the prospect of 
three straight days in action if he is to survive. Not
 for Murray the hiatus caused by Saturday’s five hours of rain or the 
absurdity, in Wawrinka’s case, of being held back then for  ‘security’ 
reasons.

Murray's Magic Moment: Wimbledon champion hits perfect drop shot

Murray need not 
worry about the other half of the draw, and had his hands full enough 
yesterday with a player whose all-round game, and remarkable movement 
for a very tall man showed that he is far more than a one-trick pony.

As
 the champion alluded, if there was a blemish on this fine performance 
it was what happened when he stepped back out at 3-0 and found himself 
confronted with a far more assertive opponent who started approaching 
the net with confidence.

It 
is possible to read too much into that passage, but you would have to 
say the restart reflected better on Anderson’s coach, ex-journeyman 
player Neville Godwin, than it did on Mauresmo in her and Murray’s first
 such  situation together.

Anderson
 (left) went out re-energised with a new battle plan while Murray 
suddenly looked unnerved. He was broken immediately and forced to cling 
on to the one remaining break he had already fashioned. We saw, for the 
first time this fortnight, the champion struggling to contain his 
frustration and berating himself, and it took him around four games to 
restore order against an inspired opponent.

A
 penny for the thoughts of Ferguson, veteran of so many half-time team 
talks, on that. The two, who text each other every so often, spoke 
briefly afterwards: ‘Not technical things or tactical things,’ said 
Murray.

‘More mental things, how you respond to tough situations. Obviously you are going to listen to someone like him.’ Two
 figures show just how authoritative, overall, his game was against a 
powerful opponent with a potent serve who did not give him a single 
double fault.

There were 19 
break points created over the three sets, and 73 per cent of the serves 
boomed down from the South African’s  end were returned in. Murray’ s 
anticipation was extraordinary, combined with lightning quick hands that
 continually saw him block the ball back.

He
 might have finished it earlier but then held his nerve in the  tiebreak
 when 5-3 turned to 5-6. A service winner saved that set point and a 
cross court backhand was to seal it.

He
 has looked supremely sharp until now and, whatever may  have happened 
after the restart, Mauresmo deserves credit for that state of affairs.
