Illness: Billy Connolly is being treated for the 'initial symptoms' of Parkinson's Disease and had an operation to deal with prostate cancer

Billy Connolly was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease during surgery for prostate cancer, it emerged yesterday.

The 70-year-old comedian underwent an operation in the US which was ‘a total success’ but doctors spotted signs of the shaking disorder.

Parkinson’s affects 127,000 Britons and symptoms include tremors while the victim rests, rigidity of muscles, slowness of movement, unsteady balance and memory loss.

Connolly’s spokesman revealed that, despite the setback, the star will continue with his work commitments.

She said: ‘Billy has been assured by experts that the findings will in no way inhibit or affect his ability to work, and he will start filming a TV series in the near future, as well as undertaking an extensive theatrical tour of New Zealand in the new year.’

Fans were concerned earlier this year when Connolly – nicknamed the Big Yin – admitted he had started to forget his lines during performances.

A show at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast in April was marred by forgetful moments where he asked the audience what he was talking about.

At the time, the father of five said: ‘This is terrifying. I feel like I’m going out of my mind.’

Connolly is staying at his home in New York.

Actor Bob Hoskins, also 70,  announced his retirement after he was diagnosed with the disease last year.

Back To The Future actor Michael J Fox, now 52,  was diagnosed as a sufferer at the age of 30. Parkinson’s is a chronic neurological disorder caused by a loss of brain cells that produce dopamine.

There is no cure and scientists have been unable to establish the cause.

Parkinson's is a chronic neurological disorder, characterised by a deficiency of  dopamine.

Actor Michael J. Fox and Muhammad Ali (right) are among the most famous people with it.

The main symptoms are slowness of movement, stiffness of muscles and shaking.

These tend to slowly worsen with time although the rate varies from patient to patient. There is currently no cure.

About 5 in 1,000 people in their 60s, and about 40 in 1,000 people in their 80s have the condition.

There is no cure for Parkinson's and scientists have been unable to work out why people get it.

Symptoms can be controlled using a combination of drugs, therapies and occasionally surgery, but often more care and support may be needed as they progress.

Sir Michael Parkinson, also battling 
prostate cancer, helped launch Connolly’s career, inviting him to a 
record nine appearances on his chat show. He said yesterday: ‘I spoke to
Billy before his surgery to wish my old friend well, and I’m pleased it
has all gone well. 

‘I’m looking forward to seeing Billy back doing what he does best – making us all laugh.’

Singer
Bob Geldof said his ‘great friend’ – married to psychologist and 
actress Pamela Stephenson – would not be deterred by his illness, 
saying: ‘He’s helped me lots in my endeavours.

'Pam and Bill are great mates. He’s as strong as an ox mentally from everything he’s been through as a kid.

‘So I don’t think this will deter him from being that individual that we know.’

Former
television presenter Michael Barrymore added: ‘Thinking of you at this 
time Billy, and the times you made  me laugh and will again. You were so
kind to me.’

Steve 
Ford, chief executive at Parkinson’s UK, said: ‘One person every hour 
will be diagnosed with Parkinson’s in the UK. Despite this, it remains a
little understood condition and we salute Billy’s bravery in speaking 
out about his condition at this difficult time.’

Coming to his aid: His audience cheered him on throughout the show despite his gaps in memory during this Irish show in April

Old problem: Billy's wife Pamela Stephenson said her husband's heavy drinking in the early stages of his career has contributed to his memory loss

'There are 127,000 people in the UK, like Billy, living with Parkinson's.

'Parkinson's can be a very difficult 
condition to diagnose, as no two people with Parkinson's are the same, 
with symptoms - such a slowness of movement or tremor - changing on a 
daily, or even hourly basis.

'Many
people, with the right medication, continue to live a full and active 
live with Parkinson's, but for some, it can be life changing and it is 
vital that Billy gets the support he needs to live with this complex 
condition.

'We wish Billy and his family all the best as they come to terms with this upsetting diagnosis.'

The disease was identified by - and named after - Dr James Parkinson who wrote An Essay On The Shaking Palsy in 1817 which established it as a recognised medical condition.

Connolly was the first superstar of stand-up, but also built a successful career as an actor, starring in a series of blockbuster films.

The 70-year-old has also presented some hugely successful travel programmes, often  linked to his stand-up tours.

Connolly was made a CBE in the 2003 Queen's Birthday Honours and awarded the freedom his home city in 2010.
