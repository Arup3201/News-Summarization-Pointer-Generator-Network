A woman who fell 80ft from a hotel balcony in Majorca lost her balance while trying to throw a spider out of her suitcase, her mother has revealed.

Chantelle Serginson, 24, of Middlesbrough, was left in intensive care after she fractured her skull and legs in multiple places when she plunged from the sixth floor of a three-star hotel in Magaluf.

Some reports suggested she fell from the balcony at the Hotel Marina Barracuda following a row with her mother, however Spanish police said the fall is being treated as an accident.

Chantelle's mother Kimberley 
Serginson, 44, who has been at her daughter's side at hospital, said: 
'We weren't having a row. You would laugh if you heard what happened.

'We had found a spider in the suitcase
and we were shouting and laughing about who was going to throw it out. 
We were saying: "You throw it out, no you throw it out".

'In the end we both grabbed the suitcase and threw the spider out.'

Mrs Serginson said that was when her daughter lost her balance and plunged to the ground.

Since the accident which happened at 
around 6pm on Friday, Chantelle was moved from intensive care to a 
regular ward, where she was being comforted by her mum.

Miss Serginson's condition had been 
described by the hospital as critical, but yesterday her mother said her
daughter had made a 'brilliant' recovery.

Speaking from Spain, Mrs Serginson 
said: 'She's doing just fine, she's talking and everything, it's been 
brilliant that she's doing so well.'

Miss Serginson was reportedly sitting 
up in bed and asking for Kentucky Fried Chicken because she does not 
like the hospital food.

Mrs Serginson has been cooperating with police and insurance companies. The accident is the latest tragedy to hit the family.

Six years ago, Mrs Serginson had her 
throat slashed in front of her daughter at her home in Middlesbrough by a
neighbour following a dispute.

Mrs Serginson required extensive plastic surgery.

Her attacker, Mark Smorthwaite, then 
34, of Middlesbrough, was jailed indefinitely and was told he could not 
apply for parole for four years by Newcastle Crown Court.

Devastating: The family were on holiday in the party resort of Magaluf when the incident happened at the three-star Hotel Marina Barracuda at about 6pm on Friday

In 1999, Mrs Serginson's seven-year-old daughter, Katie, died from a brain tumour.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of the incident and are offering consular assistance to the family.'

Three Britons have fallen to their deaths from hotels in Magaluf in the past six weeks.
