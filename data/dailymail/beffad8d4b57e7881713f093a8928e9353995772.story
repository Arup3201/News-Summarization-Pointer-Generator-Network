The six-month-old baby boy at the centre of a tug-of-love custody battle between a wealthy Pfizer executive and the family of his dead girlfriend will languish in foster care until it is resolved.

Jonathan Sporn's girlfriend Leann Leutner - who was raising son Lincoln together with her 54-year-old partner in New York - committed suicide on New Year's Day, and her son was taken into care because Mr Sporn is not his biological father.

Mr Sporn, a high-ranking executive with the pharmaceutical giant, yesterday faced his late girlfriend's sister at the Manhattan Supreme Court, where a judge said baby Lincoln would remain in foster care pending the outcome of the case.

His girlfriend's sister Susan Sylvester, 36, of Illinois, is fighting Mr Sporn for custody of the baby.

Ms Leutner, a 40-year-old corporate lawyer, gave birth to Lincoln after undergoing IVF using an anonymous sperm donor. She and Mr Sporn had been raising the baby at Sporn's apartment in Manhattan until her death.

Judge Laura Drager said at the start of yesterday's hearing: 'I believe it would be in the best interest of the child to have this matter resolved as soon as possible', but she added that the baby would remain in the care of social services until the dispute is resolved.

'I am begging this court to assist me in piecing together the shattered pieces of my heart,' Mr Sporn said in his petition for custody, according to a report in the New York Post.

The newspaper quoted a long-time friend of Ms Leutner as saying she had been estranged from her family.

Troubled: Leutner, a high-powered Manhattan corporate lawyer, had a history of mental illness and suffered from post-partum depression after giving birth to her son

Loving dad: Sporn said he was raising baby Lincoln as his own, even though the child was not biologically his because his girlfriend had been forced to use a sperm donor

Home: Leutner, Sporn and their baby lived in the Pfizer director's apartment on the Upper West Side for two years

Sporn said in the petition cited by DNAInfo.com that words cannot describe the joy he felt when little baby Lincoln was born last July.

The 54-year-old man and his 
40-year-old girlfriend, a Manhattan corporate lawyer, could not 
naturally conceive a baby, so Leutner had to undergo in-vitro 
fertilization using an anonymous sperm donor.

The couple and their new baby lived in Sporn's apartment on Riverside Drive in Manhattan for two years, but they never wed.

The
family idyll came to a tragic end on New Year's Day when the 
40-year-old mother took her own life by jumping out the window of her 
New Jersey apartment.

Since
then, the New Jersey Department of Child Protection took the infant 
away. In a desperate bid to get Lincoln back, Sporn submitted a 
heart-rending petition to the Manhattan Supreme Court on Tuesday asking 
the state to award him custody of the boy whom he considers his son.

'I
cannot change history, (the mother) is gone and while that in 
unbearable in and of itself, the fact that my son is being cared for by 
strangers and away from me, his dad, is equally unendurable,' Sporn 
wrote.

Sporn, a director of clinical 
research for Pfizer with a six-figure salary, met Leutner, a brilliant but emotionally troubled 
Yale Law School graduate, in 2010. The couple, both divorced, began 
dating and soon became inseparable, spending every weekend together and 
traveling around the country.

According
to Sporn's petition, he and Leutner were very close and even made up 
pet names for one another. She called him 'boysee,' while he nicknamed 
her 'dollzy.'

By December 2010, Leutner, a 
high-powered attorney at the renowned Manhattan law firm Simpson, 
Thatcher and Bartlett LLP, moved into Sporn's apartment on the Upper 
West Side.

'As our love for one another deepened,
it was obvious that I wanted to spend eternity with Leann, to have a 
family with her,' Sporn said in his petition.

But
the couple soon discovered that they could not naturally conceive a 
child. Determined to have a family, Leutner went to an IVF clinic at New
York University and began a grueling regimen of hormone injections and 
other treatments.

After 
several failed attempts to have embryos implanted in her womb, Leutner 
considered getting an egg donor, but Sporn urged her to keep trying 
because he wanted her to have a baby that was biologically hers.

The couple eventually decided to get a sperm donor, and Leutner finally became pregnant.

When
baby Lincoln was born in July, the couple were elated, and Sporn 
settled into the role of a caring father, reading to the infant, 
changing his diapers and playing make-believe with him.

But
Leutner had a tough time getting over her post-partum depression. The 
woman had a history of mental illness, and during pregnancy she stopped 
taking the anti-depressant Prozac, according to court documents.

Around Thanksgiving, Leutner's emotional state took a turn for the worse, and she attempted to take her life but jumping out the window. Sporn and Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, who was a close friend, admitted the mother at New York-Presbyterian Hospital.

With Leutner temporarily out of the picture, Sporn said he became a hands-on dad, 'falling deeper and deeper in love with this child,' he wrote.

'I looked forward to his cries in the night just to have another opportunity to hold this child in my arms and soothe him back to sleep.'

After 10 days in the hospital, Leutner was released home, but a few days later she made another attempt on her life by trying to jump down the shaft of a stairwell. She was committed again, but was determined to leave the hospital, which she ended up doing on December 17 with the help of a friend.

The 40-year-old woman and her son went to New Jersey, where she rented an apartment of her own. Two days after settling in the new place, Leutner plummeted to her death from the 14th floor of her building.

Sporn said he only learned of the tragedy from New Jersey caseworkers who informed him that the baby was in the custody of the state.

According to the petition, before her death Leutner had executed a formal document naming Sporn as Lincoln's guardian, and she was in the process of changing his last name to Leutner-Sporn.
