Manchester City's game against Olympiacos will go ahead in Minneapolis on Saturday night following urgent talks over the state of the pitch.

The Greek side refused to train on the temporary grass surface at the University of Minnesota’s TCF Banks Stadium on Friday and took their players to the women’s soccer facility nearby.

It is understood that they wanted the game switched to another venue and were even threatening to pull out altogether but relented during a series of meetings on Friday night.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini admitted that he was shocked by the thick, uneven grass which has been laid over the astroturf at the stadium, describing it as ‘high risk’ for his players.

‘It is more than a problem,’ he said. ‘I think this pitch is not in normal condition to play an important game. It is high risk for the players to have an ankle or knee injury.

‘I hope today or tomorrow they can make it a little bit better but at the moment it is very difficult to play football on this pitch.

‘I did not expect to have this kind of pitch here. We just played in New York on a pitch that was not a good pitch but was normal where we could pay without any problem. But that’s different from what we see here today.

‘I don’t know what can be done. You must ask the groundsman. The grass is too long and maybe they could cut it or put more water on it. I don’t know what they can do in 24 hours because we play tomorrow at 2pm.

‘It is not a reason to select one player or another, it is a reason to be worried about what will happen to all the players. That’s the problem at the moment.

‘It’s very difficult to give the players special instructions. They are running and if pitch is not in good shape maybe they can have some problems.

‘It’s a problem for injuries but also for playing good football. We’ll see tomorrow what we can do.’

The protest from Olympiacos is the second year in a row that City have been caught up in a pitch controversy on tour.

At last summer’s four-team Premier League Asia Trophy in Hong Kong, Sunderland manager Paolo Di Canio hit out at the ‘killer pitch’ after a deluge of rain disrupted the opening games and meant the surface had to be heavily sanded for the second round of fixtures, and Tottenham boss Andre Villas-Boas admitted that he would have preferred his team to pull out.
