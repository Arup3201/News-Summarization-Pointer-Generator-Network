Children from Sandy Hook Elementary School and Jennifer Hudson sang an emotional rendition of America The Beautiful as players and football fans were reduced to tears.

The 26 children who made up the choir 
all attend the Newtown school, where 20 first-graders and six adults 
were killed in a December 14 shooting.

Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers players looked deeply moved as the children sang out at the Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.

The performance was part of the pre-game
show and 
broadcast live shortly before the 6.30pm kick-off.

Shortly before her performance, Hudson tweeted: 'Such a privilege to be performing w the Sandy Hook elementary chorus at the #SuperBowl today. We go on just before kick off!'

The singer adorned her black leather Monika Chiang top with a green ribbon in honor of those lost at Sandy Hook and showed off her curvy figure in a white button-front L'Wren Scott skirt.

Before her performance, she wrote on Twitter: 'From my heart to yours! Such an Emotional roller coaster [and] So close to home.'

She continued: 'No matter who or what we r, we must pray! Thank u lord for this day! May thy will be done! Have your way , oh God!!

Each of the 26 children was picked to represent the 26 victims of the school shooting at the Connecticut elementary school.

The students wore matching white tops and tan trousers with a ribbon for the victims pinned to their lapels.

They stood on the NFL's red, 
white and blue shield-shape logo and many smiled excitedly as they sang 
the first verse before a silent and packed Superdome.

Then Hudson fronted them for a second verse that showcased her soaring 
voice as thousands of fans cheered wildly for the children.

Alicia Keys performed a jazz arrangement version of the national anthem  - and sang live - ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday.

Her publicist said the performance was live, days after halftime 
performer Beyoncé admitted singing along to a prerecorded track at the President's
Inauguration.

Crowds spent the afternoon filtering into the Superdome in New Orleans as the biggest game of the year kicked off.

The Big Easy was transformed into one massive party on Sunday as the city prepared to host the 47th Super Bowl between the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens.

The city's French Quarter was packed 
with visiting fans soaking up the atmosphere before the biggest game in 
American professional sports was due to start at 6:30 (EST).

Both
the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens completed their final 
on-field preparations Saturday, one day before the long-awaited game.

The Ravens finished their practice on the eve of the big game on Sunday 
with a 15-minute walk-through under the Superdome lights.

Children who survived the shooting 
rampage had recorded a version of Over The Rainbow to raise money for 
charity earlier this month. Proceeds benefit the United Way of Western Connecticut and the Newtown Youth Academy.

Following the Newtown massacre, many NFL teams paid tribute to the victims of Sandy Hook.

Last week, the New England Patriots released 26 white flares during a moment of silence to remember those who had died.
