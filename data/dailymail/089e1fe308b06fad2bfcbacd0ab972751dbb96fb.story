Two pilots were killed yesterday after their plane crashed into the sea during an air show in the Dominican Republic.

Carlos Manuel Guerrero and Rafael Sanchez, both Dominican military pilots, were taking part in the 'Air Show of the Caribbean' in the country's capital Santo Domingo, on the coast.

They lost charge of their small plane during stunt manoeuvres, leading the air force vessel to spin out of control.

Fatal: Both pilots were killed during the accident witnessed by hundreds of spectators

The plane crashed into the water in front of thousands of spectators gathered on the Santo Domingo waterfront.

The spot where it slammed into the Caribbean was just 500 metres from the crowd.

After the plane hit the water, its wings crumpled and it sank within less than one minute.

A military official said the area where they sank was 'quite deep', which lessened the pilots' chances of survival.

The bodies of Guerrero, 25, and 27-year-old Sanchez were recovered by divers from the country's air force and navy.

The wreckage of the Pillan plane, which was purchased from Chile in 1999, has not yet been found by authorities.

The remainder of the two-day festival was cancelled following the fatal accident yesterday afternoon.
