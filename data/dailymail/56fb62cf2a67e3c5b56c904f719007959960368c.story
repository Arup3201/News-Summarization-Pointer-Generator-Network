Merciless killer Jihadi John dressed like a gangster rapper, smoked cannabis and had an obsessive crush on a girl at school, friends have revealed.

The ISIS executioner, unmasked this week as Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, was in a violent gang which used Tasers to target rich victims and 'borderline stalked' a girl he was fixated on.

Ahlam Ajjot, 27, has spoken of her horror that the world's most wanted terrorist lusted after her when the pair were just 16 and both attended Quintin Kynaston school in St John's Wood.

'He never spoke to girls unless he had to. He was awkward,' she told Simon Wright and Dan Warburton at the Sunday Mirror.

'I never knew Mohammed liked me and I can't believe it now when I think about him feeling that way.

'I was so shocked when I saw the news that he was Jihadi John. I couldn't believe the pictures of him in a balaclava and in Syria.'

Another former friend, who wished to remain anonymous, has exposed the killer's teenage past saying he took part in rowdy vodka drinking sessions and smoked cannabis despite being Muslim.

She branded the University of Westminster graduate a 'hypocrite' and said the fact that he portrays himself as a strict Muslim is 'laughable and shameful' because of his past behaviour. 

'He smoked drugs, drank and was violent towards other boys,' she told The Sun.

'He tries to paint himself as devout, but he doesn't know the meaning of the word. The fact that he portrays himself as a strict Muslim is laughable and shameful.'

'I never saw him pray or wear Islamic dress — he would not even mention religion at all.'

It comes as sources revealed the extremist was tracked down in Syria after using a student discount code to download computer software online. 

He used a laptop in the war-torn country to download the technology with the code identifying him as the former University of Westminster computer student, the Sunday Express reported. 

Counter terrorism investigators were able to pinpoint his location from the slip-up.

'In today’s electronic age of social media and technology, we chase the digital footprint before we chase the person,' a source told the newspaper. 

'Anyone who has a credit card, a Facebook page or a national insurance number has a digital footprint.

'The same goes for a student number, these records are unique to that person.'

Emwazi who has featured in six ISIS beheading videos, moved to the capital from Kuwait at the age of six.

It has been claimed he was 'never the same' after suffering a serious head injury when he ran into a goal post as a child, according to a former classmate.

He is said to have attended anger management classes because of his violent behaviour towards classmates at school.

The female friend, who met Emwazi in 2001 when they were both 12, said he proved himself as a 'capable brawler'.

'I saw him get into a fight in the sports hall. It was over a game of pushing and shoving,' she said.

'He was suspended from school for two days because of that fight, but he didn't seem to care — he was very rebellious.'

Once they joined the same gang at the age of 13, he would skip classes and smoke cannabis outside a convenience shop.

'He would enjoy sit-sitting in the corner, smoking weed. It didn't bother him that it was illegal or against his faith,' said the friend.

Instead of attending his local mosque, he started hanging out in shisha cafes and looked up to older Asian men who drove flash cars, smoked cannabis and bragged of womanising. 

The 'painfully shy' teenager developed an intense crush on Ms Ajjot and followed her around, according to a former friend.

'Everyone could see that he was making a fool of himself and that he was borderline stalking her. But he just didn't get it,' said the schoolmate.

He said Emwazi had a habit of putting his  hand up to his mouth when he spoke after being teased about his bad breath.

The teenager was bullied and was given the nickname 'Little Mo' as he was so short. 

By the time he got to the sixth form, Emwazi's only friend was a younger boy who's older brother was killed in a US drone attack on terror targets in Somalia in 2013. 

Emwazi is said to have attended the demonstration outside the Harrow Central Mosque in North-West London in 2009 to 'celebrate' the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

The Londoner was radicalised by fanatical hate-preachers and is now on the Syrian battlefields killing in the name of religion.

One of his old friends said she saw him on Edgware Road, West London, in 2012 and he was wearing long, white Islamic robes. 

His role as Islamic State's sadistic butcher is a far cry from the 10-year-old schoolboy who dreamed of being a footballer when he attended St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school. 

Describing his ambitions for his life in his primary school yearbook, he said: 'What I want to be when I grow up is a footballer', and said by the age of 30 he would be 'in a football team scoring a goal'.

He listed his favourite band as pop group S Club 7 and said his favourite cartoon was The Simpsons.  

Kuwaiti authorities are closely monitoring several of Emwazi's relatives who  live and work in the Gulf emirate where the Islamic State executioner was born, according to reports. 

A number of the executioner's relatives are working in Kuwait and like him hold British citizenship, Al-Qabas newspaper reported.

'Security agencies have taken the necessary measures to monitor them round the clock,' the paper said, citing an 'informed source.'

His father Jassem Abdulkareem, also a British national, is currently in Kuwait and is expected to be summoned by authorities.
