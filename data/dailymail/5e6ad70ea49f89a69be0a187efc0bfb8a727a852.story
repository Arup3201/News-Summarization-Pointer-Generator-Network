Actress Kristin Chenoweth was reduced to tears after being screamed at by an airline supervisor who refused to let her fly with her beloved dog, it was claimed today.

The Glee star tried to board an American Airlines flight from Dallas to LA with her service dog Madeline when she was confronted by a gate agent who claimed she didn't have the correct paperwork.

When she protested, the agent apparently became 'verbally abusive', leaving her so shaken up she burst into tears.

Airline officials later realised they had made an error and allowed her on the plane.

After the flight on Tuesday, the singer tweeted: 'American Airlines: Dallas flight attnt supervisor Ms Kidwell. Abuse not okay. #tripfromhell'.

American Airlines told TMZ: 'We have been in touch with Ms Chenoweth to offer our apologies for the misunderstanding.

'We refunded the [$125] cabin pet charge as soon as we realised the mistake. We hope she will consider flying American again in the future.'

In November, Kristin and Madeline starred in an hilarious Funny or Die video about relationship problems to promote the American Humane Associationâ€™s Hero Dog Awards.

In the clip, she turns to a 
relationship counsellor to talk about her relationship with her 
long-suffering dog Sammy, played by Madeline.

Describing their problematic 
relationship, Kristin said: 'Sometimes we'll just be talking and right 
in the middle of a conversation he'll just get up an walk away.

'He just whines and I don't want to introduce him to any of my friends.'

The dog lovers starred in the clip to promote the airing of the awards on the Hallmark Channel on November 8.
