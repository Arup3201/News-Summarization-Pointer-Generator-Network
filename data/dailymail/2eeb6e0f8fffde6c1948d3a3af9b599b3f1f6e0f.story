David Mitchell is publishing a 6,000-word short story, The Right Sort, solely via Twitter

Award-winning author David Mitchell is using 280 tweets to tell his latest story.

Over the next week, the Cloud Atlas writer will use Twitter's 140-character posts to unveil his 6,000 short story, The Right Sort.

Mr Mitchell - who admitted the process was 'pretty challenging' - follows in the footsteps of a series of writers who have used social media to experiment with delivering their work.

There is even a Twitter account that is dedicated to posting single-tweet stories.

The author has set up a new account - @david_mitchell - on the site to tweet the story, which is about a boy who starts tripping on his mother's Valium pills.

His first post read: 'We get off the Number 10 bus at a pub called 'The Fox and Hounds'. 'If anyone asks,' Mum tells me, 'say we came by taxi'.'

Mr Mitchell told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that it is while tripping on the pills that the boy starts to see the world in short sequences of 'nice little throbs and pulses'.

He said: 'Those are the Tweets. He's basically thinking in tweets because of the Valium.

'It was really pretty challenging. It wasn't easy. But I like tight straitjackets.

'Maybe you actually need this fairly ridiculous 140-character limit to be obliged to work out something new.'

Using Twitter as a way of delivering fiction is not a new idea. Authors including Philip Pullman have used it in the past.

The short story began with this 14-character tweet - the first of 280 posts that will be used to tell the story

The story, which will be unveiled in 20-tweet bursts, is set in the same universe as his next full novel, The Bone Clocks

The social media hub even has its own fiction festival, where famous writers create 140-character poems and stories.

They then encourage regular Twitter users to do the same through the hashtag 'twitterfiction'.

The Right Sort is set in the same universe as his next full novel, The Bone Clocks. The Right Sort will be unveiled in 20-tweet bursts at 7am and 5pm every day for the next week.

The Bone Clocks will be Mitchell's sixth novel. The author was chosen as one of Granta's Best Young British Novelists in 2003, and his first novel, Ghostwritten, won the John Llewellyn Rhys prize.
