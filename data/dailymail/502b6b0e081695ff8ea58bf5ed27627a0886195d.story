To tour or not to tour - that may well be the question the Globe Theatre will have to ponder after the company sparked a furious response from human rights groups by announcing it will stage a production of Hamlet in North Korea.

The irony was not lost on critics, who were quick to point out the sinister similarities between Prince Hamlet's murderous revenge on his uncle Claudius in the Shakespearean tragedy - and North Korean despot Kim Jong Un's recent execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek.

Although Globe officials would not confirm the date of their planned performance in Pyongyang, it is included within a two-year tour of 205 nations.

Ay, there's the rub: Critics point out the irony of touring Hamlet (as portrayed by Laurence Olivier) in North Korea, where like the main character, despotic leader Kim Jong Un recently executed his uncle

The Globe will begin touring on April 23, which coincides with the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth.

Niall Couper from Amnesty International told the Sunday Express: 'North Korea is a country where the horrors inflicted on people who fall out of favour are worse than any fiction.

'No tragic play could come close to the misery that the 100,000 people trapped in the country's prison camps endure, where torture, rape, starvation and execution are everyday occurrences.'

The UN has accused of North Korea of multiple crimes against humanity and has urged world leaders to bring Kim Jong Un to trial at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

In one of his most recent shows of dictatorial power, Kim Jong Un ordered the execution of his uncle, Jang
 Song Thaek, 67, following after a military trial in December.

North Korea's official news agency said Jang had sought to 'destabilise the country' to take charge through a coup.

Before
 his death, Jang was considered one of the most powerful figures in 
North Korea and he had served as a mentor to Kim Jong Un.

In a statement Pyongyang called Jang 
Song Thaek a 'traitor to the nation for all ages,' 'worse than a dog' 
and 'despicable human scum' who planned a military coup.

In
 a sharp reversal of the popular image of Jang Song Thaek as a kindly 
uncle guiding young leader Kim Jong Un as he consolidated power, the 
North's official Korean Central News Agency indicated that Jang instead 
saw the death of Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011 as an 
opportunity to challenge his nephew and win power.

Jang was also accused of corruption, womanizing, gambling and taking drugs.

North Korea's main newspaper Rodong Sinmun ran a headline on its website that said: 'Eternal traitor firmly punished.'

A radio broadcast of the news was 
piped into the subway and people sat quietly and listened as the 
announcer listed Jang's crimes.

During his two years in power, Kim 
Jong Un has overseen nuclear and missile tests, other high-profile 
purges and a barrage of threats, including vows of nuclear 
strikes against Washington and Seoul.

The White House said that 'if confirmed, this is another example of the extreme brutality of the North Korean regime.'

Shortly after Jang's death, Kim Jong Un ordered the execution of his family members, including Jang's sister Jang Kye-Sun, her husband and Ambassador to Cuba Jon Yong-Jin and Jang's nephew and Ambassador to Malaysia Jang Yong-Chol, as well as his two sons.

Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is visited by a ghost resembling 
his recently deceased father, the King of Denmark.

The ghost tells 
Hamlet his father was murdered by Claudius, the Kingâ€™s brother, who took the throne and married Hamletâ€™s mother, Gertrude.

Hamlet is racked with guilt as he debates whether to avenge his father's death by killing Claudius.

Meanwhile, Ophelia is in love with Hamlet but their relationship breaks down as he becomes riddled with guilt. She eventually kills herself.

Hamlet arranges for a group of actors to re-enact his father's murder to gauge Claudius' reaction. He then confronts his mother and accidentally kills Polonius.

Laertes, the son of Polonius, returns to avenge his father's death. Claudius plots with him to use a poison sword, but in the event the swords are swapped and Laertes is mortally wounded.

Hamlet eventually kills Claudius but not before he too is fatally wounded.

The children and grandchildren of Jang's two brothers were also said to have been killed.

In a case of life imitating art, family loyalty and a murderous struggle for power are key themes in Shakespeare's well-known play, Hamlet, which was written between 1599 and 1602.

The play begins with Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, visited by a mysterious ghost who resembles his recently-deceased father, the King of Denmark.

The ghost tells Hamlet he was murdered by Claudius, the King's brother, who seized the throne and married Hamlet's mother Gertrude.

Hamlet is then inspired to avenge his father's death by killing Claudius.

Despite sparking criticism, the Globe Theatre has defended its decision to tour Shakespeare's masterful production in North Korea.

Artistic director Dominic Dromgoole said the company is often called upon to boycott different countries, 
including China, Russia, Zimbabwe and the US.

'The Globe resolved then that everybody meant everybody.'

Staff have also sought advice from the British Embassy in North Korea because of the potential diplomatic problems.
