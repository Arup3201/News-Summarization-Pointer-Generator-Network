Put the Rampant Rabbit away - there's a new vibrator in town. The Mojowijo is the very latest in sex toy technology -  and it could transform the way that long-distance couples communicate forever.

Billed as the toy that has transformed cybersex, the Mojowijo vibrator can be connected wirelessly to a laptop and controlled remotely, meaning that those forced to say goodnight via Skype could now see their late night calls suddenly spiced up.

The Mojowijo is a sex toy of two parts - one, a traditionally shaped pink vibrator for the ladies, the other, a blue ring-shaped device.

The ultimate long-distance sex toy? The Mojowijo is billed as the latest in cybersex technology

Both attachments are fitted to a handle that can be attached to the accessory port on a Nintendo Wii remote control.

Using the firm's patented Motion2Vibration 
technology, the device is able to transform the movements performed by each user into vibration signals and send them to another 
selected device – either in the same room or over the internet.

Couples simply download the appropriate software, dial into each other's laptops using Skype, and the presence of both Mojowijos is picked up.

Mojowijo say their 'body massagers' have been popular with couples forced to spend long periods apart

Using the motion of their own remotes, the users can then play with the settings on their partner's vibrator, upping the frequency or taking it down as required. So the more one partner moves their wand, the more the other partner's will vibrate.

One couple forced to spend six months
 apart due to work commitments say the Mojowijo has transformed their 
relationship. Amelia, 33, said: 'My partner has been working in America 
for the past six months, and we've been communicating by Skype.

'But there is only so long you can keep a spark going in a relationship without physical contact.

'These
 gadgets have really injected new life into our calls. The brilliant 
thing is that it is not just purely a masturbatory experience.

'We can control each other's device by moving our own - and it's that element that makes it so good.

'We feel so connected, even though we are on the other side of the world.'

The
 company is not the first to dip a toe into the world of so-called 
'teledildonics', but is probably the most successful to date.

Of
 their invention, the company says: 'The motions of one device are 
transformed into vibrations in the other, literally allowing you to 
share the mojo with anyone, anywhere in the world.'

'Couples
 in close relationships but separated by distance for long durations 
have been the most vocal and are looking to Mojowijo to bring intimacy 
back into their relationships or just keep them going even stronger when
 distances keep them apart.'
