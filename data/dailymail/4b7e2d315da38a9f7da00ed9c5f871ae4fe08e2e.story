A Google employee says his company hires the absolute smartest people in the world and that it's a pretty big problem.

Avery Pennarun, an engineer for Google's broadband arm Fiber based in Canada, blew the whistle on what he calls the staff's overconfidence problem in a June 30 blog post he titled The Curse of Smart People.

'Smart people have a problem,' Pennarun writes, 'especially when you put them in large groups. That problem is an ability to convincingly rationalize nearly anything.'

Stop me if you've heard this: Google employees are over-confident computer geeks with poor social skills, says Google employee Avery Pennarun (pictured)

Pennarun reasons that Google snags its smart programmers straight out of college much of the time, giving the brilliant 'computer geek types' to see how the real world works.

'Working at a large, successful company lets you keep your isolation,' writes Pennarun. 'If you choose, you can just ignore all the inconvenient facts about the world.'

Google's problem is the opposite of other less elite companies where lack of confidence plagues workers, says Pennarun.

'The curse is confidence. It's confidence that comes from a lifetime of success after real success,' he writes.

Too confident? Pennarun says that Googlers could use a dose of self-doubt in order to foster the next great innovation

So what's the solution to confidence? A blow to the ego, of course. Pennarun believes the genius masses at Google need a dose of Impostor Syndrome AKA lack of confidence.

'The people with Impostor Syndrome are the people who *aren't* sure that a logical proof of their smartness is sufficient,' he says.Â 

In Pennarun's experience, hyper confidence leads to projects being created that look great on paper but which don't lead to happy customers or innovation.

In the place of confidence, he says that Google, it's employees and its users would all benefit from some self doubt to help usher in that next great Google product.

'Impostor Syndrome is that voice inside you saying that not everything is as it seems, and it could all be lost in a momen,' writes Pennarun. 'The people with the problem are the people who can't hear that voice.'
