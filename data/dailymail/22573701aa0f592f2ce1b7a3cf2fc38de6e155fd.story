The woman who was set on fire in a vicious attack at the hands of her estranged boyfriend is now being victimized for failing to move her own - and her attacker's - vehicles from the scene of the grisly crime.

Naomie Breton, 33, says that Zuccala Towing wants $340 from the horrifically burned woman for towing her car from the gas station last Monday, in addition to $363 for ex-boyfriend Roosevelt Mondesir's car.

Ms Breton is only just recovering after she suffered second and third degree burns on her arms and chest in the assault at a Boynton Beach, Florida, 7-Eleven store on Monday, June 11.

Recovery: Naomie Breton is on the mend after she suffered second and third degree burns on her arms and chest in the assault at a Boynton Beach, Florida, 7-Eleven store

Treatment: Her arms, chest and one of her shoulders were heavily bandaged after the savage attack

Zuccala towing also says the woman must pay $25-a-day in late fees for Mondesir's car.

'I think it's a disgrace,' Ms Breton told WPBF on Thursday. 'It's not like I had a choice of where my car went to. I was on fire.'

The news station reports that since 
Ms Breton and Mondesir's names are on the car, she's got to pay up, 
according to Florida law. 'That's not right,' she added.

Mondesir is currently behind bars at the Palm Beach County Jail, being held without bond on attempted first-degree murder.

Security cameras were rolling as Ms Breton pulled up in her silver Mercedes at about 3am to meet her ex-boyfriend and pick up their son.But Mondesir didn’t bring the boy with him.

She told news station Local 10: 'He gets out of the car. He has a knife in his hand. He takes out the gallon of gasoline and starts pouring it on my car. Then he starts dousing it all at me, all at my face. Then he comes around the car and starts chasing me.'

Eventually, Mondesir allegedly took out a lighter and all Breton saw were flames.

In
the graphic surveillance video, a man can be seen threatening Ms Breton with the
large knife, struggling with her in the doorway of the store. 'Get away from 
me!' she can be heard shouting.

Ordeal: Ms Breton said Mondesir doused gasoline on her body and face and chased her with a large knife

They disappear from view for moment before in a massive fireball, screaming and running around the parking lot.

She told Local 10: 'I was screaming 
and trying to pat myself to the point the only way I saw to keep myself 
alive was to take off my shirt.'

Cops released Breton's desperate 911 call from the 7-Eleven store.

Heard screaming on tape, Ms Breton cries: 'He set 
me on fire! OK! On fire!'

In court: Mondesir is charged with first-degree attempted murder, and was denied bond during a court appearance on Tuesday

'He's still outside,' Ms Breton tells police once inside the convenience store. 'He has a knife. He set me on fire...'

'Hurry up! Please, please, please. I'm burned,'  she says.

Ms
Breton had moved out of the apartment she lived in with Mondesir back 
in March and he had threatened her several times for months after.

Just
two weeks before the attack, Ms Breton filed a restraining order 
against Mondesir, which a judge denied due to insufficient evidence, according to The South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

Mondesir, who fled the 7-Eleven on foot, was found by police officers about three hours after the incident in nearby bushes.

Tricked: Roosevelt Mondesir showed up but without their son in Boynton Beach, Florida

He is charged with first-degree attempted murder, and was denied bond during a court appearance on Tuesday.

Cops had also raided his home, where they found their 4-year-old son asleep after he had been left there alone.

'Police have been called to the house
on many times ... On March 26 he hit me and I hit him back and was 
arrested,' she wrote, according to Palm Beach County county records 
obtained by NBC.

In spite of their tumultuous history, Ms Breton said she never could have foreseen such a savage act from Mondesir.

She told Local 10: 'That night, I saw my life flash in front of me but I never ever ever would think he would do something like that to me.'

Surprise attack: Mondesir can be seen running at Ms Breton and pouring gasoline over her
