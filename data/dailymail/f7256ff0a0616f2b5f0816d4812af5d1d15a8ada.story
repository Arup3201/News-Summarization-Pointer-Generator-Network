Jeremy Lin, the newly-minted King of New York who has won the affection of the whole city by leading the Knicks to five straight wins, has finally found an apartment of his own... in suburban White Plains.

The night before his stellar performance that beat the New Jersey Nets last week, Lin crashed on the couch at a teammate's apartment after he found himself without a place to stay. Now he has rented a $3,800-a-month two-bedroom apartment in a Trump highrise in downtown White Planes, New York.

Now he as another incredible win to his name, as Lin scored the vital 3-point shot right at the buzzer of Tuesday night's game against the Toranto Raptors.

Lin credits his success on the court and his sudden rise to fame to his decision to put his fate in the hands of God.

'Sometimes you come up against a mountain and you end up making the mountain seem bigger than God,' Lin told the San Jose Mercury News.

'I was on pins and needles. I was putting all this unnecessary pressure on myself. Now, I feel like I'm free out there.'

Lin is a Taiwanese-American from Palo Alto, California, who was raised in the Chinese Church in Christ in nearby Mountain View. He has maintained his devout Christianity through playing at Harvard University and a rocky and uncertain start to his professional basketball career.

His Christian devotion and meteoric rise to stardom is reminiscent of Tim Tebow, the Denver Broncos quarterback who improbably led his team to the playoffs this fall.

Lin takes to the court tonight -- only his fifth game as a starter in the NBA -- in Toronto when the Knicks face off against the Raptors.

New digs: The upscale apartment in White Plains is home to several other Knicks players and some New York Rangers, as well

In the span of five games, Lin has gone from warming the Knicks' bench to the cover of Sports Illustrated. And until now, had no home in New York.

The 6-foot-3 point guard slept on his brother's couch at his apartment on New York's Lower East Side.

His new digs are modest compared to the multimillion-dollar mansions of his extravagantly-paid star teammates. But they're palatial for a guy whose bed was a sofa up until last week.

The apartment building, which is home to several other Knicks players and a few New York Rangers, boasts 9-foot ceilings, marble bathrooms, cherry wood floors and a built-in sound system, the New York Daily News reports.

From the 20th floor, Lin should be able to see New York City -- the town he now runs -- in the distance.

Lin is currently on the minimum salary contract for the Knicks -- a two-year, $1.2 million deal. However, some are worrying that the team will be unable to afford to keep him around at the dramatically higher salary he will no doubt demand now that he is a starting player.

Lin said admit the success and ravenous media attention, he is trying to stay focused on surrendering control of his life to God's will.

'If you look back at my story, doesn't matter where you look, but God's fingerprints are all over the place where there have been a lot of things that had to happen that I couldn't control,' he told the Daily News.

The night before his February 4 breakout game against the New Jersey Nets, NLin found himself homeless. The sofa where he usually slept at his brother Joshua's Lower East Side New York City apartment was taken -- there was a party that night there.

So Lin shacked up at the modest White Planes, New York, home of teammate Landry Fields. And crashed on his coach, a simple brown sofa. The couch is now one of the most famous pieces of furniture in NBA history.

The next day, Lin, 23, captured the hearts of New Yorkers and the attention of basketball fans around the country with his explosive play -- a career-high 25 points, five rebounds and seven assists. He's gone from sitting on the bench to the Knicks' starting lineup as the team has gone on a five-game winning streak.

And it all began on a couch.

'Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only couch made famous by @JLin7! Let the bidding begin,' Fields tweeted Sunday afternoon.

Lin, a 6-foot-3 point guard who played for Harvard University, said the couch was 'decent, but not huge.'

After his stunning performance against the New Jersey Nets, Lin told reporters about his accommodations the prior night: 'Thank you to Landry for hosting me. I think I might just move in with him,' he said.
