Two of China's most popular websites have been criticised for using 'sexist stereotypes 'on International Women's Day.

The doodles show a ballerina twirling in a music box and another depicts a girl drinking tea and surrounded by flowers while sat in an armchair.

Search engine Baidu had the ballerina in a pink dress, who first turned into a bride and then into a mother pushing a baby, on its homepage on Sunday.

Sexist doodles: The popular Chinese website has been accused of missing the point of International Women's Day with ballerina image

The depictions caused outrage on social media as websites celebrated International Women's Day on Sunday.

Video-sharing site Youku, wished female users: 'May the world treat you gently.'

Critics wasted no time in comparing the two websites to global giant Google which featured women in professions, including an astronaut, a scientist, sports players an artist, a chef and a musician. 

Weibo user @Zoexiaoyizi, said of the ballerina:  'This is how you define women and celebrate them! 

On the mark: By contrast, Google's doodle shows images of female scientists, astronauts, judges and sports stars to illustrate achievements

Chinese authorities detained several women right's activists this weekend. Some had planned to hold a nationwide protest against sexual harassment.On Monday, five were still being held police, said an activist and a friend of the women, who asked not to be identified. Beijing traditionally cracks down on activists during important meetings like this week's National People's Congress (NPC). 

'Google's doodle just makes their stupidity even worse.' 

Guo Weiqing, a professor at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, told CNN, that the imagery suggested that women are there only to be taken care of and look pretty while the business of the real world is left to men.

'Internet companies conveying such a narrow definition of women isn't good. 

'It's exactly the opposite of the International Women's Day mission, which is fighting for gender equality,' he said.

Baidu and Youku did not respond to calls for comment.
