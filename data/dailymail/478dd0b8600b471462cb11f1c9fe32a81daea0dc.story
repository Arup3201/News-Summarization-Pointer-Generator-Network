Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were today told by one of London's deputy mayors that the best way to attract more visitors is by spending their tourism budgets on promoting the capital.

Kit Malthouse - chairman of the capital's promotional team, London & Partners - said that in return London would tell visitors about spending ‘a few days up to Edinburgh or to Cardiff or to Belfast’.

The aide to Mayor Boris Johnson admitted that his suggestion was a ‘very, very hard sell’ but insisted in an interview with The Observer that all parts of Britain must recognise they can ‘win out of this’.

He said: ‘We know, for instance, that well over half - approaching two-thirds - of the people who come to the UK and who go to other parts of the UK wouldn't come if it weren't for London.

‘When you look at the pattern of tourism spending for the various regions, London comes bottom.

‘We think we will miss a trick as a nation as a whole if we don't shove it out there and point out that you can get to Edinburgh in under three hours.’

Mr Malthouse said that London spends £9million on tourism - compared to the £11million spent by Visit England, £12million by Wales, £44million by Scotland and £30million by Northern Ireland.

Last month it was revealed that of the 31million people who visited Britain last year, half spent at least one night in London. Mr Malthouse said the capital was 'the main reason the vast majority of tourists come to the UK'.

Visit Britain is looking at how it can shift holidaymakers' focus and encourage them to explore the UK's other delights, with new tourism campaigns and extra information supplied to its tourist offices abroad.

Visit Britain offices around the world are going to be given special packs to help them better 'sell' the delights of Britain, from Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, which appeared in the Harry Potter films, to Stonehenge - and experiences like our country pubs and canal network.

These will tie in with an extension of Visit Britain's ‘Great’ campaign, which has targeted key cities in key markets with films and image-led print adverts showcasing what makes Britain great.

While Edinburgh remains the second most popular tourist destination after London, many tourists miss cathedral cities such as Lincoln, York, Winchester and Salisbury.

However, Bath and Windsor often feature on itineraries for their heritage and royal links.
