A woman gave birth to a healthy baby girl just an  hour and a half after her husband crashed and rolled their car into a ditch while rushing them to hospital.

Tamarin Cox, 31, was in labour with the baby in a potentially dangerous breech position when her husband Aaron skidded on a patch of black ice.

The car slipped off the road at 30mph, and rolled down a 20ft embankment, landing on its roof.

Aaron Cox rolled his car into a ditch while driving his wife, Tamarin, to hospital when she was in labour with Islia. The couple are also pictured with their son, Kegan

Remarkably, Mrs Cox was helped out of the wreckage and was quickly taken in an ambulance to hospital, where she gave birth to a healthy 6lb 1oz baby girl, Islia.

The birth was already set to be complicated because the baby was breech - meaning she came out feet first - when contractions started in the early hours of the morning.

However, nothing could have prepared the parents for their ordeal on the way to the maternity unit in Epsom, Surrey.

Mr Cox said: 'As the car was rolling I honestly thought I had killed us. It was horrible.

'My wife was very calm and collected. She knew to brace herself and she was telling me to keep calm and not worry about it.

'When we came to a standstill I honestly thought it was a dream, because I have had that dream. So I was expecting to wake up.

The car slipped on black ice as the couple rushed to the hospital in the early hours of the morning. They were forced to climb out of the windows with the help of a passer-by

Islia had to be delivered by C-section as she was in the breech position, meaning she was born feet first

'But thankfully we came out unscathed, apart from a few scratches and aches and pains.'

Astonishingly, Mrs Cox, an NHS rota administrator, was completely unfazed by the crash.

She simply stood on the rear view mirror to climb out of the upturned Honda Jazz, conscious of trying to stay away from the shards of glass all around her.

Mr Cox managed to flag down a Good Samaritan who stopped his car and called 999, before helping to get Mrs Cox out of the crashed car.

He said: 'The ambulance arrived within about five minutes, took us to the hospital and my wife had our daughter about an hour and a half later.'

Mr and Mrs Cox and were lucky to escape the car with just a few aches and pains

Speaking from the couple’s home in Betchworth, Surrey, Mr Cox, who works for a pension provider, said his daughter was 'absolutely perfect'.

'She’s currently sleeping and is a very happy, healthy baby,' he added.

The couple, who already have one child - a two-year-old boy called Kegan - were excitedly awaiting the arrival of their first daughter when the drama unfolded on January 12.

They already had their hospital bags packed and all the documents ready before Mrs Cox went into labour.

Their carefully-made birth plan was put into action and the call was made to Mr Cox’s sister, Emma, so she could come over to their house and babysit Kegan.

Mr Cox said: 'Everything was going like clockwork until the weather played its part. My wife went into labour at about 3am. Due to our baby being breech we knew she had to get to hospital for a C-section.

'We were due to have the C-section on the Tuesday but she went into labour two days early.

'We left home about 4.30am. I was driving and as we approached a corner in the road I just lost control of the car.

'It was just through Ashtead, on the Dorking Road, only about a mile from the hospital. The hospital was just on the other side of the hill we were about to climb.

'It wasn’t a sharp bend. Not at all. When I realised I wasn’t steering the car any longer I just tried to counteract the slide.

'There were a few expletives. I was only going between 20 and 30 miles per hour. I tried to correct myself but it wasn’t happening.

'Then I hit the kerb. We did one complete roll and ended up resting on the side.'

Mr Cox said: 'As the car was rolling I honestly thought I had killed us. It was horrible. My wife was very calm and collected. She knew to brace herself and she was telling me to keep calm and not worry about it'

After checking his wife was OK, Mr Cox managed to haul himself out of the battered car window before clambering back up to the road, while also trying to call for an ambulance and the police.

'I tried to flag down passers-by,' he said. 'A couple ignored me, which I can understand, stopping for someone at that time of the morning.

'Someone did stop. He kindly helped me phone the emergency services.'

The couple have since been relating the remarkable tale to their shocked relatives.

Mr Cox said: 'I told my mother about the birth and then I asked her not to panic and said: "On the way to hospital we had a crash". She got a bit hysterical.'
