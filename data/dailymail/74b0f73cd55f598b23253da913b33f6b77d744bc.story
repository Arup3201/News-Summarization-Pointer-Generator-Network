While the first thing Lionel Messi will see each morning in Brazil is his Argentina team-mate Sergio Aguero after the two were paired to share a room, Cristiano Ronaldo will wake up to a poster of himself.

This will probably suit Ronaldo, who celebrated scoring Real Madrid’s fourth goal in the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid by whipping his shirt off and tensing his abs.

The Portugal squad arrived at their training camp to find each of their rooms had their name and squad number printed above their bed, as well as a poster of themselves hanging on the wall.

Midfielder Joao Moutinho and defender Joao Pereira both posted pictures of their rooms on Twitter and Instagram, showing the effort made to make them feel comfortable before their opening Group G match against Germany in Salvador on June 16.

Despite fears Ronaldo might miss the clash with Joachim Low’s side after struggling with thigh and knee injuries following the Champions League final, the 29-year-old looks set to play having come through 66 minutes unscathed during Portugal’s 5-1 thrashing of Ireland on Wednesday.
