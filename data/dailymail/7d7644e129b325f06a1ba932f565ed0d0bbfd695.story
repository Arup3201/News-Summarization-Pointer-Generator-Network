She's the queen of delivering rejection as a judge on her long-running show, America's Next Top Model, and now it looks like Tyra Banks has got a taste of her own medicine.

According to RadarOnline.com, the 40-year-old runway pro was snubbed by Victoria's Secret when she suggested she make a 'surprise' appearance in last December's annual CBS televised show.

'[Ms Banks] was rejected by the brand and the network, despite her long affiliation with the company,' the undisclosed source said. 'She’s outraged and is threatening to never to work with Victoria’s Secret again.'

Snubbed: Tyra Banks, 40, allegedly attempted to make a 'surprise' appearance at December's televised Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, but was rejected despite her long affiliation with the company

The reasons behind her alleged rejection? She's old news, apparently.

'Tyra’s feelings were hurt because the excuse she was given is that the audience likes to see the newest models, not the "veterans" on the runway during the VS TV show,' the source explained.

Ms Banks, who enjoyed a lucrative career as one of the lingerie giant's original Angels for eight years between 1997 and 2005, was said to have been 'dying' to make a comeback.

The sassy star made fashion history as the first African-American woman to feature both on GQ and Sports Illustrated covers.

Since then, the supermodel mogul has been running and co-hosting her wildly successful America's Next Top Model show, and will be working on its 21st cycle this summer.

She also announced earlier this year that was would be appearing in a sequel to Disney's cult hit, Life-Size, due out next year.

Newer models: Victoria's Secret apparently felt their audience were more interested in its 'newest models' (as seen in this cast shot from the show Tyra wanted to walk) rather than its 'veterans'

But as for those angel wings, it appears she won't be dusting them off and re-attaching them any time soon.

The December show, in which she reportedly wanted to appear, pulled in almost ten million viewers and showcased long-time Angels Adriana Lima, for her 14th year running, and Alessandra Ambroiso for her 13th year, as well as fledgling Angels Lily Aldridge, Toni Garrn and Behati Prinsloo. 

'Tyra doesn’t want to make a public spectacle out of the snub, because it would make all the parties involved look bad, the source concluded. 'But she isn’t happy.'
