Forget face masks and moisturizers - the latest and greatest beauty trend is to drink your way to radiant, glowing skin.

From collagen water and clay-enriched juices to superfood supplements and aloe drinks, beauty lovers around the world are now being encouraged to embrace beverages as a natural addition to their normal skincare routines.

Here, FEMAIL takes a look at the best beauty drinks on the market - each of which are tailored to tackle a different beauty concern.

CLAY- AND CHARCOAL-INFUSED JUICES

The Beauty Bombs are a new range of beauty-focused beverages created by New York-based company Juice Generation which promote the advantages of consuming clay and charcoal as part of our everyday diets.

The collection includes three cold-pressed juices, which each contain activated charcoal mixed with a variety of fruits and vegetables such as kale, lemon and celery, and two shots, which contain activated clay mixed with either rosewater or cucumber water.

Drink up! Each of the five Beauty Bombs tackles a different beauty or skincare concern

Each of the six products is aimed at tackling a different beauty issue. 

Pure Earth, a clay and rosewater shot, promises to help ease digestive issues, remove toxins from your face and body and leave your skin feeling healthy and hydrated. Activated Lemonade, a mix of charcoal, lemon, lime and raw agave, is supposed to support healthy, glowing skin, while helping to reduce bad breath and bloating. 

There's even a drink to help prevent hangovers; Activated Greens contains a healthy mixture of green vegetables in addition to the activated charcoal ingredient, a combination which Juice Generation claims will also help to support your kidney, heart and brain function.

Juice Generation founder Eric Helms, the brains behind the Beauty Bombs, spent years looking for the perfect way to bring beauty into his existing line of juices - and settled on clay and charcoal because they are so well-known for their detoxifying properties. 

'For years, I have scoured the globe seeking exotic superfruits to bring to my customers at Juice Generation,' he said. 

'While leafy greens and antioxidant-rich fruits are the core of my menu - I'm really excited to bring activated charcoal and clay to our stores. I actually looked to the beauty industry for inspiration. 

'It seems like a natural fit as both activated charcoal and clay promote inner/outer beauty - and both are fantastic detoxifiers.'

A number of celebrities have already cottoned on to the clay-drinking trend - including The Fault in Our Stars actress Shailene Woodley, Divergent star Zoe Kravitz and supermodel Elle Macpherson.  

DAILY COLLAGEN SHOTS

Banish Botox: A new wave of collagen-based beverages such as Skinade (L) and Functionalab (R) promise to tackle the most obvious signs of aging without the need for cosmetic procedures

Keeping up with her daily dose: Kourtney Kardashian is reportedly a fan of the collagen drinks and their anti-aging properties

Anti-ageing is one of the most lucrative areas of the beauty industry so it only seems right that one of the most popular beauty-focused drinks is aimed at tackling the most obvious signs of ageing: wrinkles.

A new variety of collagen-based beverages claim to banish the need for Botox and promise to provide your skin with the same smoothing effects as the cosmetic injection. 

Each of the many collagen drinks currently being marketed as the perfect Botox alternatives are aimed at supporting your body's natural collagen production, which in turn improves skin elasticity and hydration, helping your face to look smoother, plumper, healthier - and younger.

While the anti-aging beverages are now known the world over - with Kourtney Kardashian recently revealing to Cosmopolitan that she is a fan - the trend has proven particularly popular in the UK, where a whole host of celebrities have come out in support of the drinks and their wrinkle-reducing properties. 

ELLE'S SUPERFOOD SUPPLEMENT 

Created by supermodel Elle Macpherson in collaboration with renowned nutritionist Dr Simone Laubscher, the  Super Elixir by WelleCo green food supplement is aimed at providing your body with a wealth of vitamins and minerals to assist your skin's wellness and vitality.

The powder formula, which can be mixed with all manner of non-caffeinated drinks, including water, juice and coconut water, helps to alleviate the damaging effects of stress on the skin and leave you with a much more radiant and healthy complexion.

Each pot of the Super Elixir contains a balanced blend of 45 key ingredients, including bioavailable alkalising super greens, Chinese herbs, digestive enzymes and miatake mushrooms, all of which work together to help increase your skin's natural radiance.

'There's so much discussion surrounding health and fitness but what I really aspire to is wellness. Spiritual, emotional and physical... and in my experience they are closely interrelated,' Elle, 50, said the Super Elixir.

'It's not something you achieve simply through going to the gym, using expensive creams or speaking to a therapist, it's a feeling of balance and strength that originates from within and on a cellular level. 

'The Super Elixir balances and strengthens me, to enable me to be the woman and mother I want to be, and now I want to share it!'

JUICE BOOSTERS

Those in the market for something a bit fruity can get their skin-friendly fix from a variety of traditional green juices that have been specially blended to provide the perfect mix of vitamins and minerals which support a healthy, happy complexion.

Celebrity favorite Organic Avenue, which counts the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Meg Ryan and Gwyneth Paltrow among its fans, offers a selection of skin-focused juice boosters.

Fellow New York-based juice bar Juice Press also offers a selection of complexion-friendly beverages, including its Anti Aging Cold Pressed Juice and its Aloe Vera water blend. 

The Anti Aging juice contains blue green algae, which is high in proteins and fatty acids and is believed to help tackle skin aging on two levels. First, it strengthens the skin’s fibers which help to tone and lift, while also working down deep to help boost the skin’s natural structure, improving elasticity and firmness.
