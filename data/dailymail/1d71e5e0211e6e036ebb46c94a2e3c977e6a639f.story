While this summer's World Cup has been heralded as one of the best ever, for many the most memorable moments come from the 1970s - the decade that football came to life.

Television was finally allowing football stars to emerge - years before the age of Sky and BT Sport, Wayne Rooney and Lionel Messi - and it helped to establish what was an exciting period for the game.

Taschen's new book The Age of Innocence: Football in the 1970s, shows off some of the most memorable names in football in all their glory: from George Best to Johan Cruyff, Pele to Dino Zoff.

The Age of Innocence features photography by Neil Leifer, Peter Robinson, Gerry Cranham, Terry Oâ€™Neill, Volker Hinz, Jerry Cooke, Harry Benson, Sven Simon, and many others with Rob Hughes, David Goldblatt, Brian Glanville and Barney Ronay contributing as writers.
