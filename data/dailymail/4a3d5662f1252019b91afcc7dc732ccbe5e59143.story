The great-grandsons of legendary Wild West character Buffalo Bill Cody have died in a plane crash.

Kit and Barry Cody, 67 and 63 respectively, died when a light aircraft they were traveling in plunged to the ground in swamp land near Vero Beach, Florida.

Family members confirmed the brothers were among three victims of the crash. Businessman Rob Krieger, 65, was named as the final victim.

Kit and Barry were great-grandsons of William F. 'Buffalo Bill' Cody, who founded the town of Cody in Wyoming.

He was one of the most colorful figures of the American Old West and known for the shows he organized with cowboy themes that extensively toured the US and Europe.

Buffalo Bill’s Wild West toured Europe eight times. In June 1887 the show played a command performance in the UK for Queen Victoria's jubilee in front of royalty from all over the continent. 

Cody died in 1917 from kidney failure. He is buried on top of Lookout Mountain in Golden, Colorado.

Cody's great grandson Kit was believed to have been at the controls of the Cessna 310 when it crashed on Thursday.

The Federal Aviation Administration lost contact with the Cessna 310 on Thursday afternoon, and the crash site was discovered on Friday about 20 miles from Vero Beach.

His son-in-law Bryan Edwards said the three were on one of Kit’s two airplanes and had been 'island hopping' in the Bahamas before the accident occurred in the wooded Fort Drum Marsh Conservation Area, west of Vero Beach and southeast of Orlando.

Florida businessman Rob Krieger, 65, also died in the accident

Family members told the Cody Enterprise newspaper that Kit’s wife Linda was supposed to have been on the flight but dropped out at the last minute.

Kit divided his time between homes in Cody and Winter Haven, Florida. His brother Barry is a retired high school athletics director from Popular Bluff, Missouri.

Kit Cody was known for his adventurous spirit and in September 2008, at age 63, made his 1,000th parachute jump.

Following the jump he said: 'This was a good jump. Any jump you can walk away from is a great jump. In all my 1,000 jumps, I’ve never had a close call, and I hope the next 1,000 jumps will go as well.'

Kit Cody owned several motels in the Florida area and was close friends with Krieger, a prominent businessmen in the Winter Haven area.

Friends said Krieger was with the group in the Bahamas and he helped the Cody brothers with customs forms and other paper work.
