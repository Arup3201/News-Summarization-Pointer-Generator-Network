Cinema goers are guaranteed an eyeful after censors passed the film version of raunchy best-seller Fifty Shades of Grey without any cuts.

The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) have unsurprisingly made Sam Taylor-Johnson's take on E L James's 'mummy porn' an 18 certificate, but said the work 'passed uncut'.

The film, which is described as showing 'strong sex and nudity,' as well as 'the portrayal of erotic role play', stars Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as his lover Anastasia Steele.

Fifty Shades Of Grey is expected to be one of the biggest films of 2015. It is set to be released in just two weeks and The British Board of Film Classification has just passed the movie without any cuts to the sex scenes.

The movie has been widely anticipated - EL James has reportedly sold over 100 million copies of her Fifty Shades Of Grey trilogy worldwide and it has been translated into more than 50 languages

In order to stay loyal to the story, Sam Taylor-Johnson did extensive research into the world of BDSM before filming started. 

She recently revealed that she consulted a professional dominatrix for the film, which is more than two hours long, and said she 'learned a lot' from her.

She told The Independent: 'The sex scenes are pretty intense, so I'm sure people are going to feel aroused - but I've seen them so many times that I tend to forget.'

It was recently revealed that Fifty Shades is set to be the raunchiest blockbuster film in over a decade, with 20 minutes of sex in it's 100 minutes running time. 

The film - which features Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey - is said to be the raunchiest movie in a decade with 20 minutes of sex scenes 

Jamie has spoken out about his awkwardness in making some parts of the film, saying he was doing things he would not want to do to a woman 

The film, which opens on Valentine's Day, has a dozen sex scenes although Taylor-Johson said she determined not to make the whole thing about it.

She said: 'The thing that was most difficult was how and where to pepper the sex, and to not make it feel like it was gratuitous,' she said.

'So it had to be a really strong part of the story, and I had to give characterisation to each sex scene, to make them different.'

Sam Taylor-Wood has revealed that she did not want the film to be sexually explicit and says she knows that may be disappointing to some people

But even though there is a large amount of sex in the movie, she shied away from covering some of the more graphic parts of the book. 

Sam told The Guardian: 'I didn't want it to be graphically explicit, and I know that's going to be disappointing to some people.' 

'It's the build up and titillation of touch and sensuality. So I don't think it goes into the realm of porn.' 

Jamie Dornan recently revealed to Glamour magazine that he had found some of the scenes difficult to shoot.

He said: 'There were times when Dakota was not wearing much, and I had to do stuff to her that I'd never choose to do to a woman.' 

And Dakota admitted that Jamie would be the first person to cover her up, telling the magazine: 'It's stressful enough to be tied to a bed naked in a scene.

'But then they call cut, and you're still tied to the bed, naked. Jamie would be the first one to throw a blanket over me.'

The movie is one of the most highly anticipated films of the year, with the trailer having already been watched a massive 45million times on Youtube.
