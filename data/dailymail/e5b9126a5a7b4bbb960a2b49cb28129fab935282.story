A world-renowned plastic surgeon has invented a bra which supports your breasts while you sleep to stop them dropping over time, dubbed the NightLift.

According to its creator Dr. Randal Haworth, based in Beverly Hills, California, gravity takes its toll on your breasts over years of sleeping supportless, leading to 'flattening and splaying' of the tissue, as well as 'vertical chest wrinkles' when we doze on our sides.

The $98 NightLift's slightly odd appearance is down to its 'sling configuration', which cradles each breast individually and keeps them separate to avoid one putting pressure on the other, regardless of sleeping position.

'Essentially, I created a bra for each breast as opposed to a bra for a pair of breasts,' Dr Haworth tells MailOnline.

Having taken Dr Haworth's NightLift bra for a sleepy test drive, I was surprised to find it felt extremely comfortable and looked much sexier than I expected it would. 

It's far too soon, of course, to tell whether this contraption will compete with gravity on an ongoing basis, but I'll certainly be wearing it at night from now on, if just for the snugness alone.

Dr Haworth, who has performed over 2,000 breast surgeries, many of them on unnamed celebrities, claims that when worn every night, the NightLift can actually prevent the need for a breast lift further down the line.

'Prevention is what the NightLift does most effectively,' he says. 'If you’re sagging a little, our bra can’t tighten tissue that’s already stretched, but can certainly help prevent it from further stretching and sagging.'

He adds: 'Yet we have had more than a few of anecdotal reports from women stating that their breasts sit higher in the morning after sleeping in a bra.'

Harness-like: The Nightlift, which has no wiring, supports the breasts from every position and has an extra pair of J-hooks so the straps can be adjusted in seven different places to fit the wearer snugly

Mr Haworth first had his eureka moment back in 2008, when he noticed a pattern in his patients after years of private practice.

'No matter who the patient is, how old she may be, or even her cup size, those few women who make a habit of sleeping in a bra - for some reason European actresses top the list here - invariably have a higher, firmer bust-line and smoother, firmer cleavage than those who don't,' he says.

Conventional everyday bras use shoulder straps to lift the breast weight and often underwire as re-enforcement, both of which do 'nothing' when the wearer is lying down, according to Dr Haworth.

His patented system, the result of six years development and more than 47 prototypes, is called BUST (Bilateral Uplift Support Technology), and features 'cradle-shaped' outer wings to support each breast from every angle.

Coming soon: The NightLift will launch next month in three designs; the $98 bra (pictured), the $120 Cami and the $120 Nightie, all available in standard bra sizes in either black, nude or lace over nude

The Nightlift also has an extra pair of J-hooks so the straps can be adjusted in seven different places to fit the wearer snugly, and no wiring.

Well qualified: Dr Haworth (pictured) has performed over 2,000 breast surgeries 

'Wiring, which gives larger bras their structure while keeping the bra close to the rib cage, works very well for vertical support from underneath the bosom, that is, for bras worn during the day,' Dr Haworth explains.

'At night, unique gravitational forces are imposed upon the breasts which, in turn, require unique kinds of support - lateral and medial - that wiring simply can’t provide.

'Plus a lot of women find wiring uncomfortable and comfort was one of our foremost priorities.'

With comfort in mind, the bra is also crafted from foam and soft microfibers.

So could the NightLift be beneficial when worn during the day too?

'Some of our test wearers have made it their "go-to" brassiere during the day as well,' Dr Haworth remarks.

And as for wearing a regular bra at night, he says: 'A normal bra at night is better than nothing but it doesn't protect the breasts from falling to the sides when lying on your back or side.'

The NightLift will launch next month in three designs; the $98 bra, the $120 Cami and the $120 Nightie, all available in standard bra sizes in either black, nude or lace over nude.
