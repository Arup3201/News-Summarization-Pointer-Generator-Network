A Chinese man has been left with horrific burns after he fainted and fell onto the scorching ground which started to melt his skin.

These pictures show Yang Hao lying on a hospital bed in Changsha in central China's Hunan province after he was diagnosed with heatstroke.

The painful burn marks on his back were caused after he fainted and hit the scalding ground.

Much of China is in the grip of a summer heatwave with temperatures reaching 42C in some parts of the country.

It has been so hot that people have been seen grilling shrimp on manhole covers while there have been reports of eggs hatching without incubators and a highway billboard has mysteriously caught fire by itself.

The heat wave - the worst in at least 140 years in some parts - has left dozens of people dead and pushed thermometers above 40C (104F) in at least 40 cities and counties, mostly in the south and east of the country.

Authorities have declared the heat a 
'level 2' weather emergency for the first time. The category is usually 
reserved for typhoons and flooding.

Outside a shopping centre in the financial hub of Shanhai, 17-year-old student Xu Sichen said: 'It is just hot - like in a food steamer.'

Her friend He Jiali, also 17, complained that her mobile phone had turned into a 'grenade'.

'I'm so worried that the phone will explode while I'm using it,' she said.

Extreme heat began hitting Shanghai and several eastern and southern provinces in early July and is expected to grip much of China until mid-August.

At least 10 people have died of heat 
stroke in the city over the past month, including a 64-year-old 
Taiwanese sailor, the official Xinhua News Agency said.

Wu Guiyun, 50, who has a part-time job making food deliveries in Shanghai, said she has been trying to linger inside air-conditioned offices for as long as possible whenever she brings in a takeout order.

She said: 'It's so hot that I can hardly breathe.'

The highest temperature overall was recorded in the eastern city of Fenghua, which recorded its historic high of 42.7C (108.9F) on July 24.

On Tuesday, the director of the China Meteorological Administration activated a 'level 2' emergency response to the persistent heat wave.

This level requires around-the-clock staffing, the establishment of an emergency command centre and frequent briefings.

Some Chinese in heat-stricken cities have been cooking shrimps, eggs and bacon in skillets placed directly on manhole covers or on pavements that have heated up to 60C (140F).

In one photo displayed prominently in the China Daily newspaper, a boy tended to shrimps and an egg in a pan over a manhole cover in eastern Chinese city of Jinan.

In the port city of Ningbo in Zhejiang province, glass has cracked in the heat, vehicles have self-combusted, and a highway billboard caught fire by itself, sending up black smoke in the air, according to China Central Television.

The broadcaster said the heat might have shorted an electrical circuit on the billboard.

In the southern province of Hunan, a housewife grabbed several eggs stored at room temperature only to find half-hatched chicks, state media reported.

A joke making the rounds: 'The only difference between me and barbequed meat is a little bit of cumin.'Â
