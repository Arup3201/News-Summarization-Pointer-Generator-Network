Martin Demichelis has launched a broadside at Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal, claiming the Dutchman 'stank out' Bayern Munich when he was in charge there.

The Argentina defender, now at Manchester City, lost his place in the Bayern side when Van Gaal arrived at the club in July 2009.

And with the pair now on a collision course in the Barclays Premier League, it seems Demichelis hasn't forgiven his former boss.

In quotes reported by The Sun, he said: 'I achieved a great deal at Munich. I used my strengths to win a place in the first team.

'I became a fan of the club. I felt like a favourite son. But from the first moment Van Gaal arrived at Bayern the place began to stink.'

With his appearances restricted, Demichelis left for Malaga in 2010.

Despite his claims, Van Gaal won the Bundesliga title and DFB-Pokal and reached the Champions League final during his first season.

He even played Demichelis in the Champions League final defeat by Inter Milan. Van Gaal was sacked the following April.

Bayern beat City 1-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday evening, with one of the English side's former players, Jerome Boateng, scoring a late winner.

Demichelis and Van Gaal will go head-to-head when City and United meet in the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium on November 2.
