David Cameron has risked angering Tory Eurosceptics by refusing to appoint a powerful figure to spearhead a renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU.

The Prime Minister insisted Foreign Secretary William Hague and Europe minister David Lidington were ‘making good progress’ and headed ‘one of the most expert groups of people I could have’.

There have been growing calls from Conservative MPs suspicious of the Foreign Office’s attitude to Brussels for Mr Cameron to bring in a senior Eurosceptic to start talks with other EU leaders.

Those touted for the post have included former Cabinet minister Liam Fox and backbench MP Andrea Leadsom, one of the leaders of the ‘Fresh Start’ group of MPs who have been working on a blueprint for a looser, more trade-based relationship with the EU.

Others Tory MPs have suggested that a leading figure from business should be brought in to fill the role.

But Mr Cameron, asked if he intended to appoint an EU renegotiator, said: ‘I have got in William Hague and his team probably one of the most expert groups of people I could have.

‘I think David Lidington as the Europe minister played a huge role working in this area and I think we are making good progress.’

The Prime Minister said that critics had expressed doubts about the Government’s strategy when he first set out plans for a renegotiation followed by an ‘in/out’ referendum on Britain’s EU membership earlier this year.

‘Some people said at the time, “well I am not sure you will bring the business community along with this argument”. I think we broadly have - we have very strong support for negotiate and then decide with a referendum.

‘A lot of people said “well you won't get a lot of support amongst European countries for this agenda”. In fact if you read what a number of my colleagues have said there is an understanding of what Britain is trying to achieve not just for herself but the whole European Union. So I am satisfied.

‘Also, since that stage there have been some quite positive developments. The fact that we have actually cut the European budget, I think that is important, the business taskforce on deregulation, I think that is important.

‘So I think we have a very strong team, it is work done between the Chancellor, the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. We are absolutely taking the lead on this issue because it is so important for the future of our country but I am satisfied with the way it is going.’

Eurosceptic Tory backbencher Douglas Carswell expressed concern about the Prime Minister’s remarks.

‘It is very unlikely that the Foreign Secretary or the Europe Minister are even minded to get a great new deal for us, let alone likely to get one,’ Mr Carswell said.

‘The official mindset of the Foreign Office exercises a very powerful grip on ministers. The only thing that can shore up British membership is a very radical and anti-establishment renegotiation. I don’t think the establishment can deliver that.’

Mr Carswell said Mr Cameron’s refusal to appoint a special envoy to spearhead renegotiation would increase the chances of a British exit from the EU.

‘That makes it far easier for me, when the time comes, to persuade undecided voters to leave,’ he added.

Bill Cash, chairman of the Commons European scrutiny committee, said Britain needed an ‘absolutely A1 negotiating team’.

‘Those of us who were there in 1990 would be best placed to make the right judgements. If you want to deal with this properly there has to be fundamental change and the evidence is that they are just nibbling at the treaties.’

Mr Lidington yesterday wrote to a group Tory party members who had drawn up a ‘shopping list’ of EU reforms for the forthcoming renegotiation.

In his letter, reported by the Spectator magazine, the minister focused on the prospect of Europe-wide reform, rather than the likelihood of a new relationship with the EU for the UK.

‘Since the Prime Minister’s speech the debate across Europe has begun to shift: more and more national leaders are talking about powers coming back from Brussels. That is not to say that great challenges don’t remain: they do,’ he wrote.

Mr Lidington insisted that Britain has been ‘leading the charge’ on making the EU more competitive, pointing to progress towards a streamlined process for patents across Europe and capping roaming charges for mobile phone users.

He said the UK wants a new structure of EU membership that accommodates those still keen to pursue its founding principle of ‘ever closer union’ as well as those, like Britain, who do not.

‘We want an end to the obligation on all  EU members to subscribe to an “ever closer union among the peoples of Europe” and instead see the Dutch Government’s proposed principle of the “European level only when necessary, at national level whenever possible” put in place,’ he wrote.

However, the minister gave members little indication of the Government’s specific aims. He merely promised to note ‘carefully’ their views on immigration, agriculture, and employment and welfare regulation.
