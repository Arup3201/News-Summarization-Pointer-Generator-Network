An 11-year-old girl who is legally blind hasn't let her disability stop her from pursuing her passion for gymnastics.

Adrianna Kenebrew of Houston, Texas, was born with glaucoma, and as a result is extremely nearsighted and has almost no peripheral vision.

But she has high goals, and told Today.com: 'I want to be the first visually-impaired gymnast to win gold at the Olympics.'

Model athlete: Adrianna Kenebrew is legally blind, but hasn't let her disability stop her from pursuing her passion for gymnastics

Adrianna, who is in sixth grade, began taking gymnastics three years ago, and was named 2013 Female Athlete of the Year for her region by the Texas Amateur Athletic Federation.

'I just always wanted to flip and swing,' she said.

Her mother, Asha Kenebrew, said that coaches give her cues as she's approaching the vault, but she receives no other special assistance as she's navigating the uneven bars, balance beam and other types of equipment.

Adrianna uses a special magnifying machine and a small monocular lens in school, and she wears glasses when competing.

According to Kimberly Yen, a pediatric ophthalmologist at Houston’s Texas Children’s Hospital, Adrianna's vision with the glasses is 20/400 in her right eye, and 20/150 in her left eye.

Adrianna says that her impairment makes her work harder, adding: 'I like who I am.'

Mrs Kenebrew says that her daughter has had countless surgeries to prevent additional loss of vision.

'The gym is one of the only places where there are no real accommodations for her. Everything is the same. She gets on the same balance beam as everybody else,' Mrs Kenebrew said. 

'I don’t know, but I think that may be why she loves the sport.'
