Kenny Sansom pulls a story from the archives; one from the days when he was the undisputed best left back in England.

‘It was many moons ago,’ said Sansom with a smile. ‘I was at the PFA Awards dinner when this guy from Wealdstone came up and asked me if I’d mind saying hello to their left back, Stuart Pearce. He said it would give him a big boost, so I said, ‘‘No worries’’.

‘I said, ‘‘Hello Stuart, how you doing’’ and all that. Then, as I’m walking  away, this fella’s whispered to me, ‘‘That lad’s going to take your place one day, Ken’’. ‘I’d had a couple of beers and I said, ‘‘Yeah, right’’. And he did.

Plenty to offer: Kenny Sansom believes Ashley Cole can do well for England at the World Cup

‘He took my place at a time when I wasn’t in the first team. George Graham had dropped me at Arsenal and Bobby Robson phoned me at home and said he couldn’t pick me while I wasn’t in the first team.

‘I said, “Fair enough, thanks for  calling”. It happened quite sharpish really.’

Sansom played 86 times for his country and went to four major tournaments as the first-choice left back for Ron Greenwood and Sir Bobby. He has suffered addiction problems since retiring but is back in work and getting his life in order.

Stepping up: Leighton Baines is expected to go to the World Cup and could be first choice left back

The only full back to play more games for England is Ashley Cole, who has 107 caps, but the 33-year-old has lost his place in the Chelsea team this season and must wait to find if that has cost him a place in Roy Hodgson’s squad.

Hodgson will select his 23 players plus those on standby on Monday, and he must choose left backs from Cole, Leighton Baines and Luke Shaw.

‘Ashley hasn’t played that much this season and I feel maybe he’s started to doubt himself for  the first time since he was very young,’ said Sansom. ‘The flip side is that he might be fresher and well rested.

Young star: Southampton's Luke Shaw is a possible contender for the England squad

‘Leighton Baines is a better crosser, no doubt in my mind, and he can be  dangerous from a free-kick. Set pieces and crosses can be so important in big matches, when it’s tense. He’s also  comfortable taking a penalty. I’m not sure if Ashley is after missing the last one.’

Sansom added: ‘These days, the full back position is more about helping your centre half and going forward. They don’t stop as many crosses as they did, but I don’t think there are as many wingers trying to come at you.

‘The modern full back has to create on the ball. They don’t knock it long from full back, like they did. They get forward and cross the ball as much as wingers. That was more my sort of game; I loved to attack.

Ever present: Kenny Sansom won 86 caps for England before he lost his place at Arsenal and was dropped

‘Luke Shaw is exciting. He has ability and aggression. More than the other two, who tend to go wide on to their left foot, he can go either way. He can come inside and use both his feet. He’s a little bit  different. He’s younger and he’s going to be keener.

‘I’ve a sneaking feeling that Roy wants to take Shaw and I cannot honestly see him taking all three, that’s wasting a place. Personally, I’d take Cole and Baines. Ashley’s a good strong defender and Leighton’s got that lovely delivery. I’d play Cole when you have to defend and Baines if you think they’re not so strong down the right.

‘Luke Shaw is an excellent player but he’s for the future. He is one for the Euros.’

Psycho: Stuart Pearce replaced Sansom as England's left back in the late 1980s

Southampton defender Shaw, 18, has played once for England, making his debut as a half-time substitute replacing Cole in the friendly against Denmark in March. Was it the symbolic passing of the left back’s torch?

‘Luke will know, if he’s picked, that he probably won’t start at the World Cup,’ said Sansom. ‘If that happens, he’s got to look up to Baines or Cole and say to himself, “I want to be better than you”.

‘From the age of 18, every season you should add something to your game. It might be that you read the game a little bit better. It might be learning to time your jump. It could be the smallest thing, but it’s important.

‘I used to watch Ashley when he came into the Arsenal side and he’d get caught on the inside trying to tackle with his left foot, going across his body. He gave a few penalties away like that, but he worked on it until he could tackle with his right foot.

‘Whenever he had a slight problem, Ashley worked hard at it. That’s the attitude that’s got him 100 caps. Without it, there’s no way he’d have got 100 caps. He’s worked hard.

‘I think Glen Johnson went through a period when he thought he’d arrived and he didn’t play so well, then he went to Portsmouth and realised he had to pull his finger out because he hadn’t quite made it yet. He’s improved from there to become a very good full back.’
