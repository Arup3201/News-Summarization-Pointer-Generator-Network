It was the magazine cover the world had waited months for, and on Monday Kate Moss was finally unveiled in all 
her supermodel glory as the cover star of Playboy's 60th edition.

The 39-year-old showcased her slender figure as she posed topless in the magazine shoot.

While Kate may well have been naked on the glossy pages, she was wearing one thing: a glowing tan.

Before Kate bared all for the famous photography duo Mert & Marcus, she worked with St.Tropez Tanning & Skin Finishing Expert Nichola Joss to give her skin a camera-ready glow.

Here, Nichola has shared her top tips with FEMAIL on how to get the Playboy bunny look.

To create Kate Moss’ sexy, yet luminous Playboy look, Nichola started moisturising and exfoliating treatments with Kate a week before to make sure that her skin was hydrated and radiant using the St. Tropez Tan Enhancing Body Polish and Body Moisturiser.

'It’s so important to hydrate as much as possible before a big shoot because dry skin will look dull in front of a camera,' said Nichola.

Five days prior to the shoot Nichola used the classic St.Tropez Spray Tan formula to give Kate a head-to-toe skin finishing treatment, creating an even, bronzed base for further application.

Two days before the shoot Nichola applied the St.Tropez Self Tan Classic Bronzing Mousse with Applicator Mitt to keep the skin looking fresh and perfectly finished.

To add dimension and accentuate Kate’s best features, she applied an extra layer of the St.Tropez Self Tan Classic Bronzing Mousse around the inner thighs, waist, cleavage and then down her back and arms.

As a final touch, Nichola used the St.Tropez Gold Illuminator on the lengths of the limbs to make them appear longer and leaner, plus on the décolletage to accentuate her bone structure.

'The illumination and contouring makes sure the light hits the right curves,' said Nichola.

The Croydon-born catwalk star features in a huge 18-page spread of the January/February issue of the racy 
magazine, as well as the cover, to celebrate her forthcoming 40th 
birthday in 2014.
