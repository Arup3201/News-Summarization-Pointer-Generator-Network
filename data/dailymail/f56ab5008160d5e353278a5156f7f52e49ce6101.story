This is the dramatic moment that a British fugitive wanted in Belgium for alleged drug smuggling and money laundering for a Hells Angels gang is arrested by armed police in Spain.

A video filmed from a chest-cam shows one of the officers running down a street, his semi-automatic handgun outstretched as Conrad Toland is pinned to a pavement outside a restaurant in Madrid by two Civil Guard officers, with one jamming a gun into the back of his neck.

He shouts 'don't move, if you move...' as he approaches.

This is the dramatic moment that a British fugitive wanted in Belgium for alleged drug smuggling and money laundering for a Hells Angels gang is arrested by armed police in Spain

The video, released by Spanish police, begins with an armed officer running down the street towards Conrad Toland 

As two armed Civil Guard officers pin Toland to the ground - with one jamming a gun in his neck - the officer videoing the take-down points his gun at the wanted man and warns him not to move

Toland had been evading the Spanish authorities since July 2013.  

The 47-year-old Brit is described by the Civil Guard as the ringleader of a gang that smuggled 155kilos of cocaine from Ecuador to Belgium and allegedly supplied coke to a Hells Angels chapter in Bruges.

He is also accused of belonging to an armed gang by the Belgian authorities.

Toland has been brought before the National Court in Madrid to face extradition proceedings to Belgium 

Hells Angels are a fairly recent addition to Belgium, with the first chapter founded in 1997 in Gentbrugge. The motorcycle gang can now be found in seven other places including Antwerp, Charleroi City, Genk and Tongeren.

The Hells Angels MC Belgium website declares: 'They branded us as outlaws. We know, as you, only outlaws can be free.'

Controversy has swirled around the group in Belgium for a number of years, with police linking it with the shooting of three members of another motorcycle gang, the Outlaws, in 2009.

Police say that the Hells Angels are active in firearms and drug trafficking.

The first Hells Angels club was founded in 1948 in California.

Tracked down to a location in Malaga province Toland managed to dodge the Civil Guard anti-fugitive team.

But the alleged gang chief was nabbed as he left the Madrid flat of a girlfriend that had been under surveillance for months on October 13.

He has been brought before the National Court in Madrid to face extradition proceedings to Belgium.

The arrest was made by the same team that arrested Briton Trevor Moore, 45, on the Costa del Sol in January.

Civil Guard officers said in a statement that Moore was the Toland's right-hand man.

Moore, who previously lived in Belgium, is alleged to have taken delivery of 'large quantities' of cocaine from Ecuador.

Andrew Venables, a gun expert who runs WMS Firearms Training in Ffair Rhos, Ceredigion, west Wales, said today that the policemen were covert officers carrying Sig P-224 handguns.

He told MailOnline: 'I was very impressed with the video - they did a very professional job.'
