A kind hearted couple who rescued Dave Matthews from the side of the road as they drove to one of his concerts have revealed they only took the rural route as they were running late for the gig.

Emily Kraus and her boyfriend Joe were driving to see the multi-million 
selling rock star perform in Hershey, Pennsylvania when they noticed 
Matthews, 46, standing by his bike on the side of the road.

Stuck with a flat tire and no cell 
phone along a country road, the Grammy-award winner was staring down the barrel of being a 
no-show for his own gig.

In a stroke of luck for Matthews - and the couple - they were running late for his show so happened to drive past him after taking a back road route.

Kraus was driving as they passed the stranded cyclist - and her boyfriend Joe gasped as he realized who they had passed.

'We're going down the road and I'm looking out the window and I see people on the side of the roadand I'm like, "That's Dave",' he told Good Morning America.

Kraus added: 'I was like, "No, it wasn't". He was like, "I'm serious", and I turn around and I go back... and I open my window and I say "Dave?" and he says, "Pull over over there".'

Luckily for Kraus, her parents had just recently attached the bike rack onto her car.

'He says I've never seen a bike rack like this before, so Joe walks over and he's helping him put it on and I'm standing here and I'm holding his helmet,' Kraus told WHPTV.com.

Excited: The couple shared their unbelievable story on Good Morning America on Tuesday

'So we didn't know how to make 
conversation with him in fact, so we were talking about his tour and 
where he had come from,' said Kraus.

'He
 had just been in Cincinnati and he said I'm taking a short break after 
this one because I have to drop my daughters off at camp and he was just
 a very humble guy.'

After
 arriving at the venue, the couple were tailgating with friends when 
they received a call from one of Matthews' representatives asking them 
to join him for dinner.

Kraus
 said they felt a little out of place and were overwhelmed also to 
receive front-row tickets to the show, signed tickets and a personal 
thank you from Matthews during the show.

'I did not have a cell phone on the bicycle. So I thought, 'Sh*t,' said Matthews that night at his show at Hersheypark Stadium.

'And then a nice lady named Emily rode up in a red car with a bicycle rack on it and gave me a ride on to the gig.'

Grateful: He gave them front-row tickets and signed them with a message reading: 'Thanks for the ride'

Dave Matthews also signed their tickets saying thanks for the ride.

Kraus added: 'I woke up this morning, and I rolled 
over and I said, okay yeah that really happened yesterday ha ha ha ha! It was surreal we couldn't believe it.'

Last
 year, Dave Mathews, the founding member of the Dave Matthews Band 
celebrated his six straight No. 1-debuting album with 'Away From the 
World'.

And earlier this year, the father of three purchased a two-acre Malibu estate for $6,675,000.

With
 an estimated net worth of $250 million and 30 million records sold 
Matthews bought the European country-style mansion complete with a 
private beach.

The entire stretch of land in the exclusive Point Dume even has a separate 900 square foot back house for guests to occupy.
