Twelve people were killed in an horrific spate of crashes this weekend as families hit the roads for the half-term holidays.

Three men died when a double-decker coach carrying cheerleaders from Kent University collided with a broken down car on the hard shoulder on Saturday morning.

The cheerleaders – who said they were ‘lucky to be alive’ - were travelling on the M1 to an event in Birmingham when the bus collided with the Audi A3 near Flitwick, Bedfordshire.

Mr Reeves has been named locally as one of three men who died when a coach struck a car that was on the hard shoulder on the M1 at Flitwick, Bedfordshire,

In a separate accident just over an hour later, a 40 vehicle pile-up in thick fog on the M40 in Oxfordshire left one man dead and nearly 50 injured, and another person fighting for their life.

The crashes, closing two of the main motorways for traffic heading north from London, caused chaos for thousands of half-term holidaymakers on Saturday.

The collisions came as eight others were killed on Britain’s roads during the weekend’s deadly start to the half term holiday.

On Friday, two men in their 20s died when the car they were travelling in slewed off the road on and slammed into a lamp post in Featherstone, Yorkshire.

This is the scene on the M40 after up to 40 vehicles were involved in a mass pile-up near, Bicester, Oxfordshire yesterday. Another crash today, on the A511 near Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire has claimed two more lives

One man died, another suffered life-threatening injuries and  six were seriously injured in the M40 collision

A three-car collision on Saturday evening on the A11 near Attleborough, Norfolk left two women dead, while a crash between a minibus and a lorry on the A511 close to Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire yesterday (sun) morning killed two people.

Two other people died in separate collisions on Britain’s roads yesterday.

A pedestrian was killed on Sunday morning when he was knocked down by a lorry in a Bedfordshire bus station, while a woman in her 80s died in a two-car collision on the A1 in Northumberland.

One of the three men killed in Saturday’s devastating M1 motorway crash was named locally as Nathan Reeves.

Nearly 50 others suffered minor injuries during the pile-up as many families were taking to the roads for the half-term holidays

Police investigating the crash on the M40 have described it as 'extraordinary' and said it's a 'serious blessing' that more people were not killed

Eyewitnesses who saw the aftermath of the collision described the northbound M40 as being 'utter carnage'

Neighbours said the 23-year-old died just months after his cousin Shane Willett was killed as his car hit a house and burst into flames.

Mr Reeves, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was on his way back from a night out in London with two friends in their 20s, thought to be from Milton Keynes.

The driver - a man in his 50s from the capital - is thought to have been someone they met on their night out who gave them a lift home.

As they sat in the blue Audi on the hard shoulder, the double-decker bus veered off the carriageway and slammed into their car.

Police said it is too early to say whether fog would play a part in their investigation into the crash on the M40

The diver of the coach, which was carrying 63 passengers – three young men and 60 women in their teens and early 20s - was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, but was later released on bail.

Mr Reeves, one of his fellow passengers, and the driver died in the crash on the north-bound carriageway on the motorway, while the fourth man was taken to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford with severe head injuries. His condition was last night said to be critical, but stable.

None of the cheerleading squad - Kent Cheer - who were being driven to the UK University Cheerleading Nationals at Birmingham’s Genting Arena, were injured.

The team tweeted after the incident: ‘Thank you to everyone for your thoughtful messages, we’re all now safely back home. Everyone handled the situation amazingly.’

The fatal accidents happened on the M40 at Bicester, Oxfordshire, and the M1 in Flitwick, Bedfordshire 

The clean-up of the M40 carriageway took several hours because of the large amount of debris

Two young men died when the car they were travelling in slewed off the road and slammed into a lamp post.

The men, both aged in their 20s, were in an orange Ford Focus ST when it careered off the road on a bend in Featherstone, Yorkshire.

The victims, both from the local area, were travelling from nearby Wakefield when the crash happened just before midnight on Friday.

The double death was being probed by the Major Collision Team at West Yorkshire Police. 

Sergeant Ann Drury said: 'Inquiries remain ongoing today into what has clearly been a significant incident on the districts roads which has sadly resulted in two fatalities.

Cheerleader Amy Hazerhurst added: ‘Today I am feeling very lucky to be alive’, while another of the team, Jessica Hart, wrote: ‘Not gonna [sic] lie, someone up there was definitely looking out for us today.’

AA president Edmund King said: ‘These multiple deaths have brought a tragic, sad and devastating start to the weekend and half term holidays on the roads.

‘Our thoughts go out to all those who have lost family and friends in these incidents. What should be a happy day has turned into a Valentines Day Massacre on the motorways.

‘We don’t know the exact reasons for the crashes but they are a timely reminder that even though motorways are our safest roads, when there are incidents, they can have fatal consequences.’

The large number of deaths at the weekend comes despite a halving in the number of fatalities on Britain’s roads, from 3,409 in 2000 to 1,713 in 2013.

The M40 became a car park with motorists getting out of their cars after the M40 crash. The AA said the area was busy with traffic as families hit the roads for a getaway as schools are on their half-term break

A decommissioned Boeing 747 jubo jet caused more travel misery for motorists as it crawled down  the motorway behind a police escort.

Drivers who tried to avoid the chaos on the M1 and M40 came across the front section and cockpit of the 'Queen of the Skies' as it was making its way from Cotswold Airport in Kimble, Gloucestershire, to Staffordshire.

Weighing 60-tonnes, the aircraft measures 22 feet wide, 16ft 3ins high and is 137ft long. 

The aircraft left the Cotswold Airport at 7am today and headed north to Cirencester, then south east heading north up the M5 through Gloucestershire.

It will then be driven to Hereford, before arriving at the Staffordshire site.
