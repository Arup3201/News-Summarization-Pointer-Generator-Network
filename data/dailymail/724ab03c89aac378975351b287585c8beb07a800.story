David Cameron is to hold a secret Chequers summit on Thursday with his new Australian election chief to plan a crackdown on immigration and welfare scroungers to revive Tory support.

Lynton Crosby, credited with making Boris Johnson London Mayor, is to join a small group that will take charge of Conservative strategy up to the Election, due in 2015.

Dubbed the ‘Fab Four’, the group is made up of Mr Cameron, George Osborne, Crosby and No 10 chief-of-staff Ed Llewellyn.

The promotion of Crosby, together with his inclusion at this week’s meeting at the Prime Minister’s official country residence, effectively makes him the third most powerful member of the Government.

He will tell fellow members of the ‘Fab Four’ that curbing immigration and abuse of state handouts is key to winning the Election.

But his elevation has alarmed Tory 
enemies of Crosby, 55, dubbed the ‘Wizard of Oz’ for his success in 
winning election campaigns in the UK and Australia. They claim  his 
reputation for focusing on immigration and welfare could wreck attempts 
to shed the Tories’ ‘Nasty Party’ image.

When The Mail on Sunday revealed his appointment in November, officials said Crosby would work from the London office of his polling firm CTF, not Conservative HQ.

But a well-placed source said: ‘It is all a pretence. Lynton is in and out of Cameron’s office all the time and never off the phone to Osborne. The entire party is now in the hands of four men – Cameron, Osborne, Crosby and Llewellyn.’

Other Tory Cabinet Ministers have been kept in the dark about the ‘Fab  Four’ gathering  at Chequers. 

Crosby, who is being paid £200,000 a year for four or five days work per month, is renowned for his blunt macho style. He raised the hackles of  Mr Cameron’s senior female advisers by telling them  ‘there is no such thing as the women’s vote’.

‘We have spent nearly ten years trying 
to attract modern women to the party, now Crosby tells us there is no 
such thing as the women’s vote,’ said one. ‘It is an insult.’

Outspoken: Mr Crosby's elevation has alarmed Tory enemies of his. They claim his reputation for focusing on immigration and welfare could wreck attempts to shed the Tories' 'Nasty Party' image

Crosby has already clashed with Tory billionaire Lord Ashcroft, former Tory chairman, who warned  Mr Cameron not to appoint him.

Ashcroft criticised Crosby after The Mail on Sunday reported that Crosby advised Mr Johnson to focus on traditional Tory voters and not waste time chasing after ‘f****** Muslims’. 

Crosby did not deny making  such a remark but insisted he was not ‘racist’.

His return has also reduced the prospects of a Downing Street comeback for Steve Hilton, the shaven-headed Tory guru who devised the ‘Big Society’ crusade.

‘Lynton thinks that is all  airy-fairy nonsense and has no  time for Steve,’ said one insider.
