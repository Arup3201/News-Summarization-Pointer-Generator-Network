A millionaire today vowed to fight legal action accusing him of damaging the mansion house that inspired the famous hymn All Things Bright And Beautiful.

Property developer Kim Davies, 59, is the  owner of the Elizabethan manor where Irish composer Cecil Alexander is believed to have written the lyrics to the hymn sung by generations of children.

But Davies is accused of breaking tight planning regulations by making more than 60 alterations to the ivy-clad property in the Welsh countryside.

The alleged illegal alterations include replacing timber windows with 'modern' ones, the installation of a 'mosaic-clad' whirlpool bath and putting in ceiling spotlights.

Former car dealer Davies has pleaded not guilty to five charges under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The maximum penalty for a successful prosecution is two years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine.

Prosecutor Nicholas Haggan QC told a court: 'The jury will be asked to decide whether the works were executed in a manner which affected the character of a building of historical interest.

'They will also be asked to decide if those works were authorised.' 

Llanwenarth House, near Abergavenny in Monmouthshire, was built in the late 16th century and became a Grade II-listed building in 1956 because of its national importance

Davies bought the house - described as an 'historical gem' for £675,000 in 2007 and has spent more than £1million on it

Davies has previously admitted installing a new kitchen and bathrooms but has claimed the work falls outside the restrictions on listed buildings

Llanwenarth House, near Abergavenny in Monmouthshire, was built in the late 16th century and became a Grade II-listed building in 1956 because of its national importance.

The 'purple headed mountain' in one verse of the song refers to the nearby Sugar Loaf and Blorenge peaks while the 'river running by' is the River Usk, which flows close to the estate's boundary.

It was owned for centuries by the famous Morgan family, ancestors of the navy admiral and privateer Sir Henry Morgan. In 2012, the house was listed for sale with a £2.25m price tag.

Davies, who has always strongly denied the charges, is represented by London-based QC George Carter-Stephenson.

He bought the house - described as an 'historical gem' for £675,000 in 2007 and has spent more than £1million on it.

Davies has previously admitted installing a new kitchen and bathrooms but has claimed the work falls outside the restrictions on listed buildings.

Cardiff Crown Court has heard the alleged offences took place between June 25, 2007, and August 18, 2012.

Judge Daniel Williams freed Davies on unconditional bail and adjourned the hearing.

A week-long trial is due to be held in June next year.

Cecil Frances Alexander was a poet who also penned at least 400 hymns.

She was born in Dublin in 1818, and spent much of her later life in Londonderry and Strabane with her husband, William Alexander, who became Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland.

Mrs Alexander was a keen supporter of the Oxford Movement, and in 1848 published Hymns For Little Children, which include three of the most popular hymns in the English language: All Things Bright and Beautiful, Once In Royal David's City and There Is A Green Hill Far Away.

The book was published in 69 editions and all the profits were given to Irish charities.

She died in 1895 and is buried in Londonderry.
