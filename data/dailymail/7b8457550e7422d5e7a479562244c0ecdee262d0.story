Roma president James Pallotta has revealed that he has no intention of selling star midfielder Kevin Strootman, but admits the club would have to listen to 'huge' offers.

Manchester United have been linked with a £32million for Strootman, who has been rumoured to a move away from Roma despite signing a five-year deal in 2013.  

Pallotta told Bleacher Report: 'I do get annoyed. I think the papers have finally given up on the Strootman thing, because Kevin's come out and addressed it, saying he likes it in Italy and he has a five-year contract. And by the way, I wasn't going to sell him anyway!'

'My view is that I don't want Kevin to go, for example, but if someone offers a huge amount, you at least have to listen to them. 

'You're running a team, so you have to look at what's best for everyone, not just one individual. That's the way the world works.'

Louis van Gaal is a big admirer of the player having worked with him while managing Holland.

Strootman, however, has just returned from a long-term cruciate ligament injury that ruled him out of the World Cup, and says his primary focus is on playing for Roma and getting back to his best.

'I want to play more, and return to my best level,' Strootman told Sky Italia. 'I’ve signed up for five years, but so far I’ve only been playing for six or seven months. I want to play and help the team. That’s important to me.

'If I spoke about other clubs that would be disrespectful, and I don’t want to do that.'
