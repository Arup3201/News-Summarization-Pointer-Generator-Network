The Old Trafford faithful were introduced to four new heroes making their home debuts. So how did the quartet all do? Sportsmail's MARTIN KEOWN gives his expert opinion... 

ANGEL DI MARIA - 8/10

Louis van Gaal likes to have someone who can run with the ball, and Di Maria certainly does that. 

His dribbling gelled the team and helped shift defence to attack. 

Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata could all move while his movement stretched QPR.

Especially dangerous when he runs with the ball, Angel di Maria helps Man United turn defence into attack

He showed excellent technique and vision with his passing and he looked much more collective in his play - at Real Madrid he too often tried to be the main man. 

He knows how important it is to capture the hearts of the home fans and certainly did that with this performance.

RADAMEL FALCAO - 6/10

It was good that he didn’t arrive on the pitch needing to score a winner. 

He still looked tentative after his injury and will have to ease in. He made some good runs and had one chance but is still not at his sharpest.

Radamel Falcao could have, and probably should have, scored on his debut for Manchester United

DALEY BLIND - 7.5/10

An interesting footballer who almost acts as Louis van Gaal’s brains on the pitch. 

He is trusted by his former Holland and now club manager and showed great defensive intelligence to protect and press forward if needed. 

Acted as a feeder at the base of the midfield, keeping passes short on the grass. An excellent debut.

Holland star Daley Blind impressed as he provided cover for Manchester United's back four

Along with precise and uncomplicated short passing, Daley Blind was an asset in defence

MARCOS ROJO - 6.5/10

Slotted in nicely and covered his centre backs well. The change of system worked well and Rojo kept things tidy, showed good pace and strength and was happy to get forward.

Marcos Rojo was a well-balance addition to Manchester United's defence and kept things tidy
