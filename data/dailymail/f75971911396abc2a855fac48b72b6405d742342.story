A year-long outbreak of salmonella has now sickened more than 500 people in 25 states.

Health officials say recently purchased raw poultry from Foster Farms appears to be the cause.

Most of the people who have fallen sick live in California although people as far away as Texas have been infected.

Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned that the outbreak involves seven rare strains of drug-resistant Salmonella.

Shuttered: A truck enters the Foster Farms processing plant  in Livingston, California. The plant is one of three in California linked to a salmonella outbreak that has sickened 500 people across the country

Outbreak: More than 500 people across 25 states have been poisoned by Salmonella, the majority of which are in California

The government is still not issuing a recall, but instead chooses to warn people to 'handle chicken safely.'

A tiny drop of juice from this contaminated meat could easily sicken an entire family.

'Basically,
 what we’re saying is the outbreak is not over,' said Dr. Rob Tauxe, the
 CDC’s deputy director of foodborne, waterborne and environmental 
diseases to NBC News.

'As the new cases have been reported, almost all of them report eating chicken and almost all say it’s Foster Farms.'

CDC officials had originally declared the outbreak that began in March 2013 over in January.

Officials have now detected even more infections caused by the rare salmonella strains.

Infested: The plant was infested with cockroaches similar to these, officials said

Most people infected with salmonella bacteria develop diarrhea, fever, nausea/vomiting and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection.

The infection can last up to four days, but it could be months before the digestive system returns to normal.

In extreme cases it can also cause Reiter's syndrome, which can last for years and cause arthritis.

Older adults, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness from a salmonella infection.

Despite the 
illnesses, U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection 
Service officials say they have not asked Foster Farms to recall any 
potentially contaminated meat.

Fresh
 chicken parts, not frozen poultry stored in freezers, appear to be 
responsible for 524 cases so far with  194 people having been 
hospitalized because the strains are very virulent and are resistant to 
antibiotics..

More than three-quarters of the cases have been reported in California.

At
 one point, officials threatened to shut down three Foster Farms chicken
 plants because inspectors detected high levels of salmonella.

Cockroach infestation was just one of a number of problems at Foster Farms chicken slaughter facilities which were forced to close in January.

There have been five incidents at the Livingston facility
involving cockroaches dating back to last September

USDA and company officials said that Foster Farms later brought its levels into compliance.

The product in question: Foster Farms fresh chicken fillets have been linked to a salmonella outbreak that has
 sickened hundreds, with outbreaks continuing for more than a year

In a press statement
 released Wednesday, Foster Farms noted that the company was “steadily 
reducing Salmonella levels” at its facilities. The statement continued:

'Foster Farms is committed to leadership in food safety and producing the safest chicken on the West Coast.

Since
 October 2013, Foster Farms has developed a multiple-hurdle approach to 
reduce or eliminate Salmonella at each stage of production – from 
screening breeder flocks before entering the Foster Farms system, to 
farms where the birds are raised, to the plants where the chicken is 
processed as a whole bird and when it is cut into parts.

As
 a result, the company has steadily reduced the prevalence of Salmonella
 at the parts level toward a goal of less than 10 percent – well below 
the USDA-measured industry benchmark of 25 percent.'

The
 company’s statement also said: 'Foster Farms reminds consumers to 
practice proper food handling and cooking practices at all times, and 
especially during the warmer months' and quoted food-safety advice from 
the CDC: 'Salmonella illness is more common in the summer. Warmer 
weather gives bacteria more opportunity to contaminate food.'

Authorities advise chicken should be cooked to 165 degrees
Fahrenheit.
