Dream come true: Generous donations flooded in after it was revealed that 11-year-old Ashanti Smith,  who suffers from rare ageing disease, was desperate to have long flowing hair like her school friends. The youngster was treated to a pampering day where she chose a wig and had it styled at a top salon

The 11-year-old - who suffers from rare ageing disease Hutchinson Gilford Progeria and is not expected to live past the age of 15 - could not hide her delight as she had her glossy new blonde locks styled at a top hairdressers.

The youngster visited the Brighton branch of Trevor Sorbie with her mother  Phoebe and her sister Minnie.

Trevor himself helped Ashanti choose a wig from Trendo before pampering the schoolgirl at his salon. The three women also enjoyed a posh meal at Donatello Italian restaurant beforehand.

The day out came as a result of The Argus Appeal - a charitable arm of The Argus newspaper - that raised the funds for the schoolgirl. 

Speaking to the paper about their day out, her mother Phoebe said: 'Ashanti was so excited about her new wig that she didn’t go to sleep for ages.

'She loves doing these girly things. It is so nice because we can actually do something together.'

Girly day out: The 11-year-old  could not hide her delight as she had her glossy new blonde locks styled at the  hairdressers

The day out comes two months after Ashanti was forced to remove a pink wig she wore to school as the school claimed it might encourage others to dye their hair. 

The pupil at Oakmeeds Community College, West Sussex, was told to take the wig off by a teacher because it was 'not cold in the school' and she felt so humiliated that she didn't want to return.

Her mother Phoebe said at the time: 'She was devastated when they told her to take it off. Her little heart was broken. It's disgusting. It is bright but she should have the right to wear whatever colour hair she wants.'

'She was so proud of her hair but this has put her on a downer.

'When I took her into school three teachers by the office said she looked glamorous and beautiful and said how lovely her wig was.

'But as soon as I turned my back they told her to remove it. It was so embarrassing for her. 

'It's a pink wig, come on, other children would have understood. I have only got a few years left with her so we want her to live it to the full.' 

Girls day out: Speaking about their day out, her mother Phoebe said: 'Ashanti was so excited about her new wig that she didn't go to sleep for ages'

Ashanti's rare condition, Hutchinson Gilford Progeria, causes symptoms including stunted growth, hair loss, weight loss, wrinkled skin, stiff joints, and heart disease.

The pink wig was donated by friends as Ashanti's family struggles to afford human hair wigs. 

In June this year it emerged that Ashanti's father stole £3,500 of charity money that was intended for her to go swimming with dolphins.

She was given the donation by Sussex British Motorcycle Owners Club (SBMOC) in 2010 so she could go for a once-in-a-lifetime trip to America.

But her father Albi Elliott, 44, hid the money from the rest of the family and within two months had spent it - on trips to Tesco.

Blasting his actions as 'callous and despicably devious', the judge at Chichester Crown Court jailed Elliott for three years.
