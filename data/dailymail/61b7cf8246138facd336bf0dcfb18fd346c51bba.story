Tragic: Teacher Jessica Philpott, 38, was found hanging in the grounds of a psychiatric hospital three months after inspectors expressed 'major concerns' that it was not safe for vulnerable people

Friends of a former teacher who was found hanging at a psychiatric hospital have criticised the Trust for failing to keep her safe.

Jessica Philpott, 38, who suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder, had been a voluntary patient at Mill View Hospital in Hove, East Sussex, which had previously been reviewed over patient suicides.

A jury returned a verdict that Miss Philpott died of hanging which was linked to her condition, but said they could not be sure she intended to kill herself.

Yesterday, her close friends said that she should not have been allowed to die in a 'place of safety'which had a 'duty of care'towards her.

The five-day inquest at Brighton Coroner's Court heard that the former assistant head of year was found hanging in the garden of the hospital.

The garden had not been risk-assessed for ligature points and could not be seen from the main hospital because of its situation and because a light was not working.

A Care Quality Commission report that identified 'major concerns' about the safety of vulnerable people because of the number of ligature points at the hospital also failed to include the garden.

The inquest was told that the nurse most closely involved in her community care had contacted the hospital to warn them she was considering 'final acts'.

Jude Godden, a community mental health nurse, told the inquest: 'She sounded to me even more final than she had sounded before.'

But his warning was not passed on to the night staff responsible for her care, something other members of staff said should have happened.

Brighton and Hove coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley said she was 'worried about the fact it hasn't been passed on... you knew she was in danger and you were right.'

The jury also heard that Miss Philpott, of Brighton, had made two apparent attempts at self-harm that afternoon, but had still been able to get hold of a television cable which she used as a ligature.

The inquest heard that one patient warned a nursing assistant on duty that night that someone was trying to hang themselves in the garden. The assistant found the ligature and cut it down, but did not associate it with Miss Philpott.

Another patient warned nursing staff that a patient was trying to escape over the fence in the garden. Two members of staff found Miss Philpott in the garden but did not know about the incident with the ligature and so did not take further action after she insisted she was ok.

Worrying: A report on Mill View Hospital, pictured, had identified that 'vulnerable people have unaccompanied access to environments where ligature points exist, placing them at risk of harm'

The coroner paid tribute to staff who cared for Miss Philpott and said their attentiveness had 'shone through'.

But consultant psychiatrist Dr Sabine 
Munzinger said: 'When people are so infuriated and determined to do 
something, no amount of observation can save them.'

Yesterday, her close friend Justina 
Percy said: 'Jess' death should never have happened. Yes, she engaged in 
risky behaviour but that was part of her condition as was her 
impulsiveness.

'I still find it hard to accept she died whilst in a place of safety where she was owed a duty of care.

'She was not kept safe and no amount of trying to explain this away takes away the tragic outcome.'

Close friend Trudi Nicholas added: 'Jess shouldn't have died. She needed to be kept safe and this didn't happen.'

Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation 
Trust said it had implemented the 30 recommendations of an independent 
review into the hospital which began after four patients died in 2010.

The jury returned a verdict that Miss Philpott had died from the act of hanging, but that her intentions were 'indeterminable'.

Helen Greatorex from Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We are all so very sorry that Jess died as she did.

'The team supporting her over the years had come to know her well and were deeply saddened at her death. Their care and devotion to Jess were commended by the coroner.

'Our thoughts are with her family and those who loved her dearly.'
