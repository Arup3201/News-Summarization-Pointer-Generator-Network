The hackers who breached computer networks at Sony Pictures Entertainment then leaked hundreds of damaging emails and files have unveiled a seventh cache of data.

The Guardians of Peace group, which has disclosed financial information and embarrassing private correspondence from the highest echelons of the entertainment giant, heralded the seventh 'gift' in a message on a file-sharing site.

The hackers wrote: 'We are preparing for you a Christmas gift. The gift will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting.

Disclosures: Amy Pascal, chairman of Sony Pictures, was revealed to have insulted President Obama and referred to Angelina Jolie (right) as a 'brat'

'The gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put Sony Pictures into the worst state.'

According to technology site Re/code, the new information will deal with a 2006 acquisition of a video site called Grouper, later renamed Crackle.

Sony has been battered by the disclosures, which include racist emails mocking President Obama, and insults directed at Will Smith's children.

Most of the exchanges involve Sony Pictures chairman Amy Pascal, who is now said to be fighting to keep her high-powered job.

Other disclosures included accusations that Leonardo DiCaprio is 'despicable' for pulling out of a film, and a description of Angelina Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'.

Further disclosures have centered on the upcoming release of The Interview, a film depicting the assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.

Exchanges reveal pressure was applied to director and star Seth Rogen to change the death scene.

Some have claimed that the hackers are linked to the North Korean regime.

Another repercussion of the hack has been the alleged collapse of Sony's financial systems. 

According to reports Friday, the company is now unable to process transactions, which has led to external companies canceling film shoots.
