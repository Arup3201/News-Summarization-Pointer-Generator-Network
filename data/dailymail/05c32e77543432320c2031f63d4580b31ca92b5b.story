Suited and booted: Natalie Hynde, the daughter of musician Chrissie Hynde, arrives at Brighton Magistrates' Court following her arrest during anti-fracking protests

The daughter of musicians Chrissie Hynde and Ray Davies appeared in court today after she was arrested during anti-fracking protests.

Environmental activist Natalie Hynde was charged with trespassing 
on railway property at Balcombe in West Sussex on August 18.

She had been due to stand trial at Brighton Magistrates's Court in Sussex today, although her case was adjourned until next year.

No evidence was heard during today's hearing, with the 30-year-old's trial now set for March 17.

The former model arrived at court today dressed in a suit, shirt and pink tie.

She was arrested on August 18 as energy company Cuadrilla conducted exploratory drilling on the outskirts of the village at the height of anti-fracking protests.

Hynde, of St Leonards-on-Sea denies the single charge of trespassing.

Opponents of fracking - which involves high-pressure liquid being pumped deep underground to split shale rock and release gas supplies - feared Balcombe would become a site for the extraction method.

In June, a British Geological Survey claimed there may be more than 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas under the North of England alone.

Industry experts claim even if 10 per cent is recovered – more than all of the gas produced from the North Sea – it will be enough to power Britain for 50 years.

Now a similar study is being carried out in the South, with results expected next spring.

Although no fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, took place there, Balcombe was thrust into the national spotlight over the issue, with a number of protestors attempting to block equipment from being taken into the site.

Return date: No evidence was heard during today's hearing, with the 30-year-old's trial now set for March 17

The anti-fracking movement led to dozens of protesters setting up camp outside the drill site and a policing bill of around £4 million, forcing Sussex Police to apply for Home Office help.

Campaigners had turned up to the West Sussex site included Bianca Jagger and former Page 3 model Marina Pepper.

Hynde, who with her dark hair closely resembles her famous mother, was born in 1983, the year before her parent's four year relationship ended.

During their time together the pair would regularly collaborate musically, with Pretenders recording a version of the Davies-penned I Go To Sleep.

Pretenders singer Chrissie, herself an outspoken animal rights activist, went on to marry Jim Kerr of Simple Minds fame and later artist Lucho Brieva, while Mr Davies, of The Kinks was married three times.

Hynde, who grew up in north-west London and moved to Leonard’s-on-Sea in Hastings two years ago, works as a painter and decorator. She is also a veteran of the Occupy London campaign.
