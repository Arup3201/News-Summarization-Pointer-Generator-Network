Workers had an awe-inspiring view as they dangled from ropes to carry out what must be one of the most daring window cleaning jobs in the world - polishing the glass at the Grand Canyon Skywalk.

Technicians from Abseilon USA hooked up a series of ropes to polish more than 40 panes of glass underneath the horseshoe-shaped bridge on Tuesday.

The structure juts out 70 feet from the edge of the Grand Canyon, offering visitors a view of the Colorado River 4,000 feet below.

No easy job: More than 40 panes of glass underneath the horseshoe-shaped bridge were cleaned by the technicians from Abseilon USA

Abseilon USA vice president Kenneth 
Piposar said the company's work has also included rappelling down into 
the Grand Canyon to retrieve water bottles, hats and other trash.

The
 Skywalk is at the west end of the Grand Canyon on the Hualapai reservation, outside the boundaries of Grand Canyon 
National Park.

It opened in March 2007 and was expected to attract a million visitors a year to tread its glass walkway and look down three-quarters of a mile.

A Las Vegas developer spent Â£18million putting the structure together, drilling steel anchors 46ft into the limestone rim to hold the deck in place.

At the time it was opened, the Hulapai
 Indians hoped it would rescue their reservation from poverty as 
previously tourists had concentrated in the Grand Canyon National Park, 
90 miles away.

'Once 
everybody sees this, and it's televised, they're going to know to come 
here,' said Robert Bravo, the tribe's operations manager.

What a view: The structure juts out 70 feet from the edge of the Grand Canyon, offering visitors a view of the Colorado River 4,000 feet below

Project 
overseer Sheri Yellowhawk was more pragmatic. 'With so much poverty and unemployment we had to do something,' she said. 'It sounded like a good idea.'

At the opening, architect Mark Johnson said the Skywalk can support the weight of 'a few hundred people', although there is a limit of 120, and will withstand wind up to 100mph.

He equipped the overhanging section with shock absorbers to keep it from bouncing like a diving board.

Mr Johnson said his creation, twice as high as the world's tallest buildings, was 100 per cent safe. But he warned anyone who walked on it needed a steel stomach and an excellent head for heights.
