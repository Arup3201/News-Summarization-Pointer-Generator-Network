Disillusioned: Anne said she 'could not adapt' to the pace of modern life and new technology

A second British woman who grew 'tired of life' has been helped to die at a Swiss suicide clinic.

The woman, who was 99 and from London, was not ill or disabled and simply chose to end her life.

It comes after a retired art teacher committed suicide 
at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland after she grew weary of the pace 
of modern life and how technology was changing society.

The
 89-year-old felt that her failing health, as well as her belief that 
people were becoming ‘robots’ attached to their gadgets, gave her little
 reason to live.

The woman, 
who wanted to be known only as Anne, had suffered from worsening health 
in recent years, but was not ill or infirm.

The deaths have stoked the ongoing debate over balancing a right to die against the dangers that vulnerable people could be exploited.   

Retired doctor Michael Irwin has helped a number of Britons end their life at Swiss suicide clinics. He told the Sunday Express that 3,000 ­patients are helped to die every year.

He said: 'Doctors do not wish to stand by and watch their patients suffer needlessly. It has always gone on.'

He said that the second woman had not used Dignitas, but instead a smaller clinic.

He said: 'She was not terminally ill, nor was she particularly severely disabled, yet she could not find much enjoyment in living any more and felt the time was right to say goodbye.'

Mr Irwin, who founded the Society for Old Age Rational Suicide and helped with Anne’s application to Dignitas, said: ‘She was a feisty individual and a very independent person all her life.

When she became elderly and her daily activities became increasingly restricted, she decided to go to Dignitas.

‘If you are mentally competent you can rationalise whether or not you want to end your life, after you take a look around and decide you don’t like what you see.’

He said there were at least three people in similar circumstances to Anne who ended their lives in Switzerland in recent years.

There is to be a free vote in Parliament on the Assisted Dying Bill, under which two doctors could prescribe a lethal dose of drugs to a terminally ill patient with less than six months to live.
