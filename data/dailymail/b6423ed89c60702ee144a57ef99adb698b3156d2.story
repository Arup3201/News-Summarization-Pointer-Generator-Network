Three Somali pirates were killed in a fight over the ransom paid to free Michael Scott Moore, the German-American journalist freed this week after two years and eight months of captivity.

Local police said gunfight broke out in the central town of Galkayo late last night when some of the pirates who held Moore attacked their comrades, accusing them of conducting a secret deal with negotiators.

A top pirate commander was among the three people killed, police official Mohamed Hassan said, adding that one group of pirates accused the other of betrayal.

Michael Scott Moore, the German-American journalist held for almost three years for ransom by Somali pirates as he appeared during his captivity. His pirate captors have killed each other in a row over the money.

Journalist Michael Scott Moore went free on Tuesday after a ransom was paid, pirate commanders said. Germany has refused to confirm if it paid the $1.6 million which pirates say they received

The clash started after one group of pirates appeared unwilling to share the cash with others, said Bile Hussein, a pirate commander in the coastal town of Hobyo, told The Associated Press on Friday. 

He said earlier that a ransom of $1.6 million was paid by Somali intermediaries acting on behalf of Germany.

Germany's Foreign Ministry hasn't confirmed money was paid and U.S. policy forbids the payment of ransoms.

The 45-year-old Moore, who holds both German and U.S. citizenship, was flown to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, where he was said to be getting medical care after being freed in Somalia, according to Germany's Foreign Ministry. 

A statement issued Thursday through the German magazine Der Spiegel, for which Moore had freelanced in the past, said he was safe but not healthy.

Moore was seized by pirates in January 2012 in Galkayo as he drove from the airport.

Just four days later, U.S. Navy SEALs rescued an American and a Dane in a nighttime raid while killing all nine of their guards. Those two had also been kidnapped in Galkayo in October 2011.

Hussein, the pirate commander, said the pirates who held Moore grew tired of keeping him and were increasingly concerned the U.S. would attempt to use force to secure the journalist's freedom. 

The pirates had been holding out for a ransom of $5 million, he said, but decided to settle for $1.6 million offered by negotiators after a long period of silence.

The towns of Hobyo and Galkayo are well-known pirate dens in Somalia and Moore was abducted around the time pirates turned to kidnappings for income after their income from hijacking ships declined as a result of armed internationals vessels conducting anti-piracy patrols off the coast of Somalia.
