She might have been flanked by some of the biggest names in world cinema but as Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence stepped onto the red carpet outside London's Leicester Square Odeon, all eyes were on her.

The reason? A stunning quilted white gown by what has become her go-to label for big events, be they premieres, fashion shows or the Oscars, French fashion house, Dior.

Her polished red carpet look is a far cry from the early years of her career, which saw the gauche starlet suffer a series of wardrobe malfunctions and the odd fashion faux pas.

Who, after all, could forget the cheesecloth smocks and flowing skirts worn by the now 24-year-old for one of her early forays into fashion or, indeed, the overly revealing red Calvin Klein gown worn to the Oscars in 2011.

She also managed a faux pas, quickly laughed off, when the plunging custom made Thierry Mugler gown she wore to the Bloomsbury Ballroom for the Hunger Games afterparty in London last night slipped down to reveal a flash of nipple to gleeful photographers.

Nip slips notwithstanding, the last three years have seen Ms Lawrence blossom into a serious fashion player - and most of it is down to a series of well-chosen gowns by Dior, a label that also boasts Charlize Theron and Natalie Portman among its well-dressed legion of fans.

Indeed, so devoted to Dior is Lawrence, she has become a regular sight on the front row at the label's shows and viewed the brand's most recent couture outing from a perch beside Dior CEO Sidney Toledano.

'Some of the greatest red carpet moments in the last couple of years have come from Jennifer Lawrence in Dior,' comments fashion expert and blogger, Simon Glazin.

'It's a very clever partnership on the brand's side - they knew they were tapping into an actress who would "make it".

Different style: In Dior at the Cannes premiere of Jimmy P last year, at a 2012 premiere in New York and in Paris last November

Glamorous: The 24-year-old in Dior at the LA premiere of Silver Linings Playbook, at the 2013 BAFTAs and at a party in Cannes last year

'Jennifer fits the Dior aesthetic perfectly,' he continues. 'She favours the strapless gowns, and always the bigger, voluminous shapes which in turn make her stand out every time.' 

Although Lawrence undoubtedly enjoys the perks of a close relationship with the fashion house - not least of which is a lucrative contract that has seen her become the face of Miss Dior - some would argue that it is Dior that has benefited most.

After all, how many actresses would have the guts to take to the red carpet at the Toronto International Film Festival sporting a star-spangled tie-dye gown or would manage to pull off a sheer grey gown last seen fluttering down the catwalk during a premiere?

But while Lawrence has won plaudits for her sleek look, things haven't always gone to plan, not least when the actress managed to rip her dark blue Dior gown during the SAG Awards in 2013 and tripped over the skirts of her voluminous frock during the Oscars of the same year.

Nevertheless, as last night's glamorous quilted frock proved, Lawrence is now a style icon to be reckoned with and left co-stars Natalie Dormer, Elizabeth Banks and Julianne Moore looking dowdy in comparison as she appeared on the red carpet beside them.

For that, there's only one label to thank - the ever glamorous House of Dior.
