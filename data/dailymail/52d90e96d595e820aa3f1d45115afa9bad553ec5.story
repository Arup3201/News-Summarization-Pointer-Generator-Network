A New York City truck driver is accused of using a fancy bumper-retracting gadget to help him avoid paying the toll on the George Washington Bridge. 

Authorities say Pablo Ortega was seen activating a device to make his 'bumper lift to a 90-degree angle' so his license plate would be 'unreadable to the EZ-Pass reader' by an officer from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police who was positioned at a toll booth earlier this week. 

Ortega, 45, was charged with tampering with public records and possession of burglary tools.

Authorities believe that Ortega was trying to avoid paying a $95 toll for crossing the George Washington Bridge 

Police say he used a device to lift his truck's bumper at a 90 degeree angle to avoid an EZ-Pass reader

The officer observed Ortega flipping a switch on the dashboard of his red 1997 Peterbilt tractor-trailer as he entered the bridge from Fort Lee, New Jersey. 

The suspect had a load of candy he was hauling across the Hudson River.

It normally costs $95 for an 18-wheel truck to cross the Hudson into upper Manhattan.

The rear license plate of the truck was covered with grease and unreadable, the New York Post reported. 

Port Authority spokesman Joseph Pentangelo said: 'This is more sophisticated than most of the contraptions we've seen in the past.'

The device, which can be used legally to protect bumpers from getting scraped, cost Ortega about $2,500. 

It is not known how many times Ortega used the device.

The device on Ortega's red 1997 Peterbilt tractor-trailer was operated by a switch on the vehicle's dashboard��
