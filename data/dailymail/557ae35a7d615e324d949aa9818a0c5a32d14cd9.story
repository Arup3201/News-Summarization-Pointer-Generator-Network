If only all males could be so in touch with their feelings.

The latest video invoking sighs all over the world this week features a little boy choking up while listening to Say Something, a breakup song by American duo A Great Big World and featuring Christina Aguilera.

Four-year-old Jackson was completely overcome by the piano ballad that he burst into tears while riding in the car with his parents, who filmed the scene and uploaded it to YouTube.

They describe the clip as 'the first moment (Jackson) has been moved'.

The breakup song seems to have had quite the effect on the four-year-old

It's too much: Jackson's parents begin to worry they should turn the song off because of what it's doing to their son

'Do you like the sad song?' his dad asks.

Although Jackson nods, he doesn't seem to be happy and is wiping his eyes.

His dad offers to turn off the song, but Jackson says its fine.

'Give me a thumbs up if youâ€™re OK,' his dad presses.

Then Jackson gives a tiny thumbs up.

The video has so far reached over 285,000 views on YouTube.

The all-important thumbs: As the video ends, Jackson shows he's just fine with this signal

'This is the sweetest thing ever. I love how sensitive he is and I hope he continues to feel comfortable expressing his emotions,' one viewer commented.

The lyrics of the song speak of a lover that implored to make a statement that could potentially reverse a breakup, with the singers expressing humility, sadness and regret.
