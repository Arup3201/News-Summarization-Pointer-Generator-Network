The death of a British tourist in a Vietnamese hotel room remains a mystery after local doctors blamed alcohol consumption but a British pathologist insists he had not drunk enough to kill him.

Student nurse Jake O’Grady, 26, was found in his hotel room while on a backpacking expedition in Vietnam at the end of last year.

He had been travelling for just over a month with friends Katie Benefer and Ciara Desmond when he became unwell while celebrating the New Year in the city of Hanoi.

Police later entered his room Hong Ngoc Hotel and found his body in bed after his friends raised the alarm.

Student nurse Jake O'Grady, 26, was found dead in his hotel room while on a backpacking expedition in Vietnam at the end of last year

A post mortem examination was carried out by Vietnamese doctors who found Mr O’Grady had died on January 1 from acute respiratory failure as a result of alcohol abuse, adding that there was a slight blood clot to the left of his forehead, suggesting violent contact with a hard object.

But Home Office pathologist Dr Alison Armour was unable to confirm the cause of his death and said that the 212 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood was not in the fatal range.

The legal limit for driving is 80mg.

No drugs were found and there was no suggestion of violence or suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.

The details emerged at an inquest in Preston, held after Mr O’Grady’s body was flown back to the UK.

In
 a statement read to the court Dr Armour said: 'There is no evidence of natural disease to cause or accelerate 
death. 212mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood would cause a moderate degree
 of intoxication but is not within the fatal range which is nearly 
400mg. In my opinion it is insufficient to cause this man’s death.

'I can’t contribute this young man’s death to the abuse of alcohol. Death should be regarded as unascertained.

He had been travelling for just over a month with friends Katie Benefer and Ciara Desmond when he became unwell while celebrating the New Year in the city of Hanoi

'I
 disagree with the cause of death from the post mortem in Vietnam. There
 are no marks of violence to the body, no evidence to support the view 
that he had been the victim of an assault.'

The coroner heard Mr O’Grady, from Morecambe, Lancashire was an 'outgoing friendly guy who was loved by many people.'

He and his friends had travelled from the UK on November 20 2013 to go back packing around the Far East.

They had visited Thailand and Cambodia before arriving in Vietnam on December 19 and had checked into the hostel on December 29, 2013.

But on December 31, the friends became separated after a night drinking in bars.

The two girls left Mr O’Grady at around 3.30am at the Lighthouse Bar to go home but Miss Benefar had become concerned about his wellbeing after he failed to respond to her text messages.

In a statement read from Det Insp Beverley Foster of Lancashire Constabulary, Miss Benefar confirmed that she was notified by police on New Year’s Day that her friend was dead.

Miss Benefar was asked to identify his body and she confirmed her friend looked 'peaceful'.

Area
 coroner Simon Jones recording an open conclusion into his death said 
that he had two conflicting autopsy reports on Mr O’Grady’s cause of 
death.

But he said he preferred the conclusion of Dr Alison Armour in view of her accreditation by the Home Office.

He
 said: 'Dr Armour, she found no explanation for this young man’s sudden 
death, no evidence of any natural disease to cause death or collapse.

'She disagrees with the conclusion of the Vietnamese post mortem. In her view the alcohol level was not at a level where fatality occurs, which is normally around 400mg. I prefer the conclusion of Dr Armor in view of her accreditation as Home Office pathologist.

'I’m satisfied that the cause of death must be recorded as unascertained rather than acute respiratory failure due to alcohol abuse, given the comparatively low level of alcohol which would lead to a moderate degree of intoxication but would not contribute to death.

Home Office pathologist Dr Alison Armour said that the 212 microgrammes of of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood was not in the fatal range

'There is no explanation for this man’s death and I formally record as unascertained. Cause of death could not be established.'

Mr O’Grady was a former pupil of Our Lady’s High School in Lancaster and was a student at Preston College at the time of his death.

Headteacher at Our Lady’s Catholic College, Mr Brendan Conboy, said: 'The community of Our Lady’s is deeply shocked and saddened by the untimely death of a popular and fondly regarded young man.

'Jake will be remembered for his vibrancy, his caring nature and for his friendly, outgoing manner. His family are in our thoughts and prayers.'

A spokesman for Preston College: said: 'Jake had ambitions of being an adult nurse. He studied a Health and Social Care Level 2 course followed by an Access to Health professions course at Level 3, which would usually lead to further training in nursing or care work.

'Jake was a considerate, warm and passionate individual who was always supportive of other learners in the group both in their academic life and personal life. He studied with us for two years, progressing from a Level 2 diploma with a distinction star and then achieving a distinction in his Level 3 course.

'Jake made such a positive impact on his fellow students and his tutors, his ability and determination would have made Jake a top class nurse and he will always be in the memories of those who knew him. Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with Jake’s family.'
