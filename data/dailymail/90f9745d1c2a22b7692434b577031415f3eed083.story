Low fat food sold as good  for you is often anything but because it contains more sugar, a study suggests.

It found manufacturers are making their ‘healthy’ options more palatable by replacing fat with sugar.

Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Wolfson Institute, said people need to reduce their consumption of both.

Investigation: Dispatches found that one of Waitrose’s own-brand low-fat vinaigrette (right) had ten times the sugar content of the standard version (left) - 15.6g compared to 1.58g

Claim: Tesco allegedly puts almost three times as much sugar into its ‘25 per cent less fat’ peanut butter (right) than in its ordinary spread (left) - 15.2g compared to 5.5g

‘The problem is, not only are we 
developing vascular disease but we’re getting obese and getting 
diabetes, and that’s due to too many calories,’ he added.

‘Fat
 is a major source of calories but so is sugar, and added sugar is an 
unnecessary part of our diet. It is a dangerous substance that’s making 
us obese.’

The study, 
conducted for a Channel 4 Dispatches investigation to be broadcast 
tonight, found that a ‘skinny’ lemon and poppyseed muffin from Starbucks
 had 44.3g of sugar, or just over 11 teaspoons.

That
 is much more than the 35g in a can of Coca-Cola and the same as in a 
triple Belgian choc Mississippi mud muffin from the same chain.

The
 Starbucks ‘skinny’ blueberry muffin contains 34.7g of sugar – 8.6 
teaspoons – which is more than the 28.1g in the ‘classic’ version of the
 same product.

Last week, 
the World Health Organisation closed a consultation on guidance 
recommending that no more than 10 per cent of our daily calories should 
come from ‘free sugar’ added by manufacturers or naturally occurring in 
food. This is the equivalent of 12 teaspoons.

However,
 even supposedly healthy fruit juices and smoothies can contain much 
more than this. A supersize massimo version of Costa’s ‘red berry 
cooler’, for example, contains 97.1g of sugar, equivalent to around 24 
teaspoons.

Comparison: Morrisons frozen chicken tikka masala (top) meal contains 7.4g of sugar - less than half what is in the NuMe chicken tikka masala meal (bottom) of 16.3g

Fruit-based 
drinks from Caffe Nero, Starbucks, McDonald’s and Pret A Manger were 
also heavy on sugar, containing the equivalent of more than 12 spoons.

There
 is growing concern about the issue and health experts, including the 
Government’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, have suggested a 
‘sugar tax’ may be necessary to cut consumption.

The
 Dispatches study found a 400g pack of Morrisons NuMe low-fat chicken 
tikka masala and pilau rice contains 16.3g of sugar, compared with 7.4g 
in its standard frozen equivalent.

A
 similar trend was seen in low-fat yoghurt. For example, a 150g pot of 
Waitrose black cherry low-fat yoghurt has 26.3g of sugar – 6.5 teaspoons
 – compared with 21.2g in its ‘lavish creamy’ equivalent.

Lower-fat
 biscuits are another culprit. For example, Sainsbury’s ‘35% less fat’ 
lighter ginger snaps have 4.2g of sugar per biscuit, or just over a 
teaspoon. That compares with 3.4g for its standard ginger snap.

The
 study also found people eat more when food is promoted and labelled as 
low fat. ‘People take it as a green light,’ said dietician Nicole 
Berberian. ‘It is misleading.’

She
 added: ‘Low-fat foods can be good for you, but that is not always the 
case. Some might be giving you a lot more sugar than you think.’

Food
 companies are doing nothing illegal by having higher sugar levels in 
products described as low fat or light, as long as the details are 
included in nutrition panels. Statistics show that 32.3million Britons –
 61 per cent of the population – are overweight. Of these, 13.25million 
are clinically obese.

Terry 
Jones, of the Food and Drink Federation, said: ‘As an industry, we are 
committed to providing consumer choice, including lower-fat versions, 
and responding to demand for healthier choices.

‘Products have very clear calorie labelling to allow individuals to compare and choose the right product for them.’
