'We've got fans on the pitch. The game's still going on'. That's not me making a mess of Kenneth Wolstenholme's infamous words from Wembley in 1966 when the boys in red won the World Cup. 

That was Jonathan Pearce's spontaneous reaction on commentary when some Villa fans piled onto the playing area towards the end of their team's semi-final at home to West Brom.

Of course they were scenes that no one wanted to see. Except that they very nearly were. Because they were a hare's breath from what we saw when Geoff Hurst went through to make it 4-2. Only time surely makes that a less controversial incident?

The FA Cup is a tournament that we were told had lost its lustre. And attendances may well have endorsed that. 

But this season, with the FA succumbing to the scheduling charms of their new telly twins the BBC and BT, the tournament seems to have taken on a new lease of life. 

The kind of effervescent and exciting competition in which frequent nostalgic reruns of great Cup days somewhat ironically often includes the sight of fans celebrating on the pitch.

Not that that makes that group of Villa fans' behaviour justifiable. Although you might debate that a Midland derby that doesn't kick-off until Saturday tea time could just be asking for such a response?

But the timing was because, I can only assume, the slots were preordained for the BBC to include Saturday and Monday evenings. While BT had Saturday lunchtime and Sunday afternoon. And with the Beeb having first dibs on that deal.

Or in other words, Auntie had what they'd consider would be the ideal ties, with which to ensure the biggest possible audience, at the best possible times in their schedule.

This was a situation BT Sport decided to create a silk purse from. Why hadn't we'd been following this season's giant killers Bradford, a nation had cried, having been caught up in the excitement of what had gone on so far with their exploits?

Well, on Saturday lunchtime, BT went free to air to answer that call and show us this season's favourite Davids in action live against the Goliaths of...Reading. OK, not a hell of a mismatch, but Bradford were still a great story.

Unfortunately this potential silk purse of a game became something of a pig's ear on Bradford City's pitch. Indeed, such a vision in mud it was, it required the club to provide BT with a strange little turf rug on the touchline to put beneath their shiney plinth. 

Nevertheless, there it was, an old school FA Cup that we could all watch, for nothing, and keep the momentum going on what was proving to be a vintage Cup season.

By way of a precursor for the new Premier League telly deal, this sense of occasion rolled on into Monday night. Again, this was a slot that may have driven the purists mad.

Not to mention some fans from North London who would have had to make their way back from Lancashire by any means necessary on a school night. But again, if you look at the bigger picture, it was the kind of game that could once again get people excited about the Cup.

And a formidable old pro line up of Roy Keane, Alan Shearer, Ian Wright and Martin Keown alongside Gary Lineker all helped ensure that there was indeed the sense that what we were witnessing was an event.

Next up, more disruption for four teams whose replayed games will be shoe horned in to fit nicely for us folks at home. regardless of how it affects their League schedules.

But I echo Dermot O'Leary's cry of 'woohooh' when he drew his team Arsenal's ball for the semi final draw against either Bradford or Reading. Yes, it has lacked a certain sense of tradition. 

Yes, it has occasionally proven awkward for certain clubs, and their fans. And yes it provided that unsavoury moment at Villa Park.

But I celebrate the fact that the FA Cup has been put back in the forefront of our football thinking. And if it is because the BBC and BT have decided between themselves to make it their own, then I'll live with the negatives and embrace the positive.
