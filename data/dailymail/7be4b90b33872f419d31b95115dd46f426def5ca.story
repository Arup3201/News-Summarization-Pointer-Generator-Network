A bar in New York has been forced to remove a sign reading 'No Irish drunks' after complaints from customers.

The Dock Bar & Grill in Montauk on Long Island had a sign displayed in the window with a banned list which included 'Irish drunks' along with strollers and cell phones.

After complaints were made, the owner George Watson, pasted over a replacement sign which read 'No Sensitive Drunks'.

After the uproar, The Dock covered up the word Irish so the sign would read 'no sensitive drunks' this weekend

Mr Watson told Irish Central: 'If you spoke about any other religion or race they would probably take offense to it; the Irish have a sense of humor.'

There were mixed reviews on the bar's Facebook page over the offending sign. Beth Wallis wrote: 'god sake people its the Docks sense of humor I think its a great sign. lol!!!!!!!!!!!!'

Helen Milne added: 'Oooooh talk about limiting your clientele:('

However another, Helen Cangemi, wrote: 'People, get a grip! If you MUST be politically correct, please stay in the Hamptons.'

Maura Donahue also quipped: 'I am beginning to think all this outrage is just an elaborate joke that I am gullible enough to fall for. Now that would be the Irish I know and love!'

The Dock is situated in Montauk, a busy fishing town which is popular with tourists.

The owner George Watson, a former New York City firefighter, bought the bar in 1973. He makes little apology for the bar's attitude - where anyone can be the butt of the joke.

On his website he wrote: 'At The Dock, we feel that in order for a joke to be funny, it must be told at someone’s expense. We tell ethnic, sexist, and racial jokes - everyone gets their turn in the barrel.'

He added: 'If you are self absorbed yuppie scum with a cellphone and ''free spirited'' children, go elsewhere.'

Last week, an Irish cafe found itself in hot water after it put a sign in the window asking for 'no loud Americans'. 

Peter's Place in picturesque County Kerry posted the message which said: 'No bus/coach or loud Americans. Thank you.'

The Dock in Montauk, Long Island has drawn negative criticism after its sign which some believe perpetuated stereotypes about the Irish
