The brother-in-law of Columbia, South Carolina mayor was shot dead execution style Friday outside a Charlotte, NC mini-mart.

Witnesses reported hearing as many as nine shots fired at Donald Gist Jr., whose sister is Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin’s wife, in the brazen daylight murder. One witness said there were multiple bullet wounds to his head.

Authorities have fingered violent career criminal Arthur Givens, 40, as the main suspect in the killing, and have issued a warrant for his arrest as they hunt him down.

‘I was across the street. I saw him. I heard the shots. It was about eight or nine shots,’ Victor Brown told WSOC. ‘It was scary. Everybody scattered out. It was very scary.’

The shooting took place just after 1PM, according to eyewitness accounts. It occurred in the parking lot of the Queens Mini Mart.

Mr Givens reportedly hit Mr Gist with multiple rounds in the horrifying attack.

makes me mad, it makes me very mad,’ said Kevin Biddle. ‘Because this
