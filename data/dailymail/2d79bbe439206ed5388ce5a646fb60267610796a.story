Charged: Shaquille Jones, 21, was charged with murder and two first-degree home invasion

Two suspects in the fatal shooting of a University of Michigan medical student say they sneaked into Paul DeWolf's basement bedroom at his medical fraternity during a burglary attempt and that his shooting was unintended, according to police statements.

The Detroit Free Press reported today that it obtained police statements from two men jailed on murder and home invasion charges in the death of Paul DeWolf, a 25-year-old prospective surgeon whose body was found July 24.

According to the statements, the suspects and a third man not yet charged in the case broke into Phi Rho Sigma medical fraternity and entered DeWolf's basement bedroom, startling him.

DeWolf went to get something from his dresser and one of the suspects tried to strike him with the gun, but it fired instead, according to the statements.

Ann Arbor police Detective Katie Nucci recounted the statements at a November 22 warrant hearing for Joei Jordan, 20, and Shaquille Jones, 21, the newspaper said.

Using data about a stolen computer, investigators tracked Jordan to Sumter County, S.C., and Jones to North Charleston, S.C.

A third suspect accused of firing the gun is jailed in Michigan on a bond violation in another case but hasn't been charged in DeWolf's killing.

Victim: Paul DeWolf was found dead in his bedroom in a fraternity house in Ann Arbor, Michigan on July 24

In her testimony, Nucci said Jordan entered through an open rear window as Jones and the third man, 21-year-old Dajeon Franklin, remained outside.

Jordan emerged a short time later with a PlayStation 3, taken from a basement recreation room in the house and hidden in his backpack, the detective said.

Joei Jordan, 20, was also arraigned on murder charges

Jordan
 climbed back through the window and let the other two in through a rear
 door, Jones told detectives.

Eventually, they ended up in the basement,
 where they hid in a utility closet when they heard two students coming 
down a hallway, Nucci testified.

The three of them then made their way to the room where DeWolf lived and entered.

Jones
 said DeWolf got out of bed 'and was asking what was going on', the 
detective testified.

She said Jones told investigators that the third 
suspect 'pulled out a handgun and pointed it' at the medical student and 'ordered DeWolf not to move'.

'At some point DeWolf grabbed 
something off of his desk and/or drawer' and started to move toward the 
third suspect, at which time the man 'raised the gun and attempted to 
strike DeWolf with the gun, and the gun at that time fired.'

DeWolf screamed, and the suspects ran off, Nucci testified.

The next court dates are Thursday for Jones and December 12 for Jordan.

Franklin has not been charged yet.

DeWolf was an enlisted second lieutenant in the United States Air Force and was
 studying at university to complete his surgical training.

He was in his fourth year of studying and graduated from Grand Valley State University in Allendale three years prior.

Joshua DeWolf said his brother was excited about beginning a military career after graduation in May 2014.

'His life came to an end in his prime,' Joshua DeWolf said to Ann Arbor News.

'I have no tears for him,' Thom DeWolf, Paul's father, said at his funeral on Sunday. 'He is released. He is in heaven.'

Another of his close friends, Jason Halterman said that DeWolf had an infectious love of life.

'He loved everyone regardless,' said Halterman to ABC News.

'He taught me to be a better, more caring person and I love him for it.'

Police say DeWolf failed to arrive for a scheduled assignment at the Veteran's Affairs Hospital.

DeWolf was a frequent poster to Facebook about his passion for scuba diving and running marathons.

He was the captain of the cross country team at Schoolcraft High School and graduated as class valedictorian in 2006.

He
 took his bachelors degree in bio-medical sciences from Grand Valley 
State University in 2010 and then joined the Air Force - where he was in
 the top ten percent certified in officer training.

He belonged to Sigma Phi Epsilon at Grand Valley State University and Phi Rho Sigma Fraternity at the University of Michigan.

DeWolf
 was a brilliant piano and French horn player, was a certified scuba 
diver, traveled the world on several mission trips, and had competed in 
marathons. He was a devout Christian.

A statement from the university said that DeWolf was the 'epitome of everything great in the field of medicine.'

'We extend our deepest condolences to Paul's family, friends and colleagues,' UM president Coleman added to the statement.

'He
 was working and training among a close, nurturing community of healers 
and I know they will help each other through this difficult time. They 
will need the support of the broader campus community in the weeks and 
months ahead, and we will provide it.'
