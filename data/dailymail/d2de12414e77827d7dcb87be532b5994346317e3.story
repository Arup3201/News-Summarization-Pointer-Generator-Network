Police have warned pet owners after two dogs died and three others needed medical treatment when they ate poisoned meat which was found in a park.  

A mysterious poisoner apparently used the deadly toxin methomyl to poison pieces of meat which they then left to be eaten in Fryent Country Park in Brent, north-west London.  

Local police have teamed up with the RSPCA in a bid to find the culprit and prevent other animals from suffering the same fate.

RSPCA chief inspector Simon Osborne said: 'This kind of poison is extremely toxic for dogs and other animals if consumed and it is very concerning to hear that this is what caused the recent deaths.  

'We urge anyone who knows of any person who has a stock of this particular insecticide at home or in even their shed or garage to talk the police or ourselves in complete confidence, so we can investigate further.'  

A Natural England spokesman added: 'It's distressing and disturbing to think that somebody could be using such a dangerous toxin so indiscriminately.'  

Police urged dog owners to be extra vigilant, and advised people to wear gloves if handling any toxic substances.  

Danger: Pet owners should be vigilant in order to avoid the risk of coming into contact with methomyl

Sergeant Peter Rowntree, of Brent Police, said: 'With better weather and longer hours of daylight the parks will be busier and I am hopeful that any criminal activity is more likely to be seen and phoned through to us.'  

It is a criminal offence under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 intentionally to give a poison to an animal.  

No one has yet been arrested over the apparent poisonings, and it is not clear whether or not the toxic meat was in fact deliberately left around Fryent Country Park.  

Methomyl is a synthetic chemical which is extremely toxic to humans and animals.  

It is used as a pesticide, but its use is restricted in Europe because of the dangers it poses and it is not widely available in shops.  

Reports of animal poisoning increased by nearly 10 per cent in the last year, according to the RSPCA, with a total of 1,154 complaints.  

However, the charity has also warned that many animal lovers are accidentally poisoning their pets by allowing them to come into contact with toxic substances such as chocolate or rhubarb.  

Chief veterinary officer James Yeates said said: 'Chocolate poisoning is one of the most commonly reported types of animal poisoning, so Easter is the ideal time to remind people of the hazards around their home that could accidentally poison their pets.  

'Easter eggs are a tasty treat for many of us, but a hefty vet's bill won't be quite so easy to swallow if your pet ends up wolfing them down before you.'
