Fatima Dyczynski was travelling to Perth to start a new life as an intern for IBM on flight MH17

The grieving parents of Australian MH17 victim Fatima Dyczynski  saw a lot when they arrived at the Ukrainian crash site but nothing that diminished their belief that their daughter had somehow survived.

George and Angela Dyczynski   arrived back in the Netherlands on Tuesday after a five-day trip, during which they achieved something no Australian government-backed humanitarian mission has done, reach the crash site in rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine.

At Amsterdam Airport, the Perth-based parents clasped a flyer for the upcoming International Astronautical Congress in Canada and told AAP: 'Fatima is a speaker at the conference.'

There was no suggestion the couple's brilliant 25-year-old daughter might not be able to make it to Toronto in late September.

Indeed, Mrs Dyczynski later threatened to sue anyone who suggested - without evidence - that Fatima was dead.

Her parents also want their daughter's colleagues from the space science community to become involved in the crash investigation.

'She was an aerospace engineer, she was a scientist, she was a young person with new ideas and new perspectives and new horizons,' Dr Dyczynski said on Tuesday.

'We want more scientific investigations with the data that's already gathered. It should start now - not wait months and months until we forget.'

Dr and Mrs Dyczynski arrived at Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands last Friday and walked past the MH17 memorial

Dr Dyczynski and his wife, Angela, still hold onto hope that their daughter, Fatima, is alive

The couple say an expert panel including space scientists could help prevent future incidents.

Dr Dyczynski believes something is amiss in the world's skies - particularly given the disappearance of MH370 in March.

'Maybe not all things are looked at from the right perspective,' the cardiologist and acupuncturist said.

'Maybe other perspectives are important to investigate. It's not only maybe a missile [that downed MH17] but something more.

'If it would have been a missile, and the rebels shot down this aeroplane, they would not have handed out the black boxes.'

It is one thing to question how the plane was brought down, but another to believe a passenger could have survived.

The fact the Dyczynskis do is down to a combination of faith and science.

'There is a small possibility that something still survived,' Fatima's father said.

'The people of Donetsk were first at the crash site and if somebody survived maybe they have taken them.'

Dr Dyczynski threatened to sue anybody who suggest his daughter was not alive

The couple plan to stay in Amsterdam for two or three days and then likely head home to Australia.

They have received support from back home and from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop who wrote to them after the crash.

In return, the Dyczynskis left Ms Bishop, who's currently in Kiev, one of four sunflowers they took from the crash site.

The remaining three flowers are destined for the Netherlands' Princess Beatrix and Fatima's two grandmothers.

When they arrived in the Netherlands on Friday night en route to the crash site, Dr Dyczynski said he and his wife knew the dangers of the war zone, but it was something they had to do.

'Every day we believe she is still alive,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'We believe our daughter is alive and we’re going to look after her.

'We know it’s a dangerous place but we have to go because she is our daughter.'

Miss Dyczynski, who is trained in aerospace, aeronautical and astronautical engineering, was moving to Perth to start an internship at IBM 

The Dyczynskis were some of the first people to take up the Australian government's offer to fly victims' families to the Netherlands to accompany their loved ones home, if they so wish.

Miss Dyczynski, who was trained in aerospace, aeronautical and astronautical engineering, was moving to Perth to start an internship at IBM.

Miss Dyczynski was the chief executive and founder of Xoterra Space, a high-tech start-up company developing means to create tiny satellites which would connect mobile phones to directly to space technology.
