Loophole: The anonymous woman, a former foster child, had her procedure sanctioned by social services days before she turned 21

A 21-year-old foster child had a sex change operation funded by New York Children's services, it has emerged.

The patient used a loophole that covers procedures for people without health insurance to pay for surgery to become a woman last Wednesday.

It is only the second case of publicly-funded gender reassignment since the rule came into effect in 2010.

Social services approved the operation, which costs around $10,000, days before she turned 21, when most children leave the foster care system.

Transgender rights activists have hailed the anonymous woman's move as 'inspirational'.

Mariah Lopez, a member of Strategic Transgender Alliance for Radical Reform (STARR), told New York Daily News: 'What's happening now is a shift by ACS, in the largest city in the world, influencing health care nationally.'

ACS would not comment on the surgery.

A spokesman said the agency supports 'the health and well-being of all young people in its care'.

A statement added: 'ACS reviews all requests for medical treatment on a case-by-case basis, conducting internal reviews as well as consulting medical professionalsâ€™ expertise, to ascertain the nature and severity of a medical condition and determine if a procedure will provide a significant benefit to a youth.'

Supporters say the woman was entitled to the treatment as it is more than a cosmetic procedure.

It is the latest controversy surrounding sex change operations in New York, after a man became the first person to use a crowd-funding website to raise money to pay for surgery in November.

Shakina Nayfack, was born Jared Nayfack in Orange County, California, where she faced years of abuse from people for wearing nail polish and dressing in high heels.

The woman travelled to Pennsylvania for the surgery on Wednesday, which costs around $10,000

The performance artist, 32, who now lives in New York, vowed to raise $52,500 to pay for the sexual realignment surgery in a Thai clinic.

She has already spent $10,000 on laser hair removal, electrolysis and hormone replacement theory during her transition from 6ft 2ins, tattooed man to a woman.

Appealing through the website YouCaring.com, she said: 'I have been out as trans since 2001, but only decided to undergo a full gender transition toward the end of 2012.

She added:'There is really no way I can complete this process without the help of friends and online supporters.

'I decided to launch this campaign to raise the the money I need to finish my transition.

'"KickStartHer" might be the world's first ever crowd-funded sex change!'

A spokesman for YouCaring.com spoke out against the project, claiming it was not appropriate in conjunction with appeals for money to fund cancer treatments.
