Organisers of a Newtown children's choir that has appeared on Good Morning America are facing accusations they have misled the public - as the group has no formal connection to Sandy Hook.

While the Newtown Music Project features a handful of children from the school, it is organised independently and led by a teacher who quit her job at a Newtown high school after she was accused of theft.

The choir, which has recorded a single of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' to raise money for the town, will appear on the Grammy's this weekend. It is a separate choir from the Sandy Hook Elementary School choir that performed alongside Jennifer Hudson at the Super Bowl last weekend.

On Thursday, the school district superintendent Janet Robinson voiced misgivings about the choir during an appearance on CNN after parents called her office with their concerns.

Questions: The children from the Newtown Music Project are seen singing on Good Morning America last month. The group does not have anything to do with Sandy Hook Elementary School

They had complained about Sabrina Post, who is leading the choir and runs a performing arts studio in the town, and her history with the school system, Robinson said.

Post had been the choral director at Newtown High before she was charged with stealing through bogus expense vouchers and placed on leave in February 2005.

She resigned in June 2005 after agreeing to pay the school board $11,000, the Hartford Courant reported.

Robinson said parents were also confused whether the choir had been to the Super Bowl. Those students do attend the school where a gunman killed 20 students and six women on December 14.

'I just know that I've got a lot of 
people saying, "They're on Good Morning America. These aren't our 
kids,' Robinson said. 'Why are they using this name?'

Disgruntled: School district Superintendent Janet Robinson said parents are unhappy about Post's part

But Post said Good Morning America contacted her to organise the children's choir after learning she was a popular private music teacher working in the town.

'Everything is done by the book,' said Post, who is not paid for working with the choir.

Last month, the choir featured on the show, with many of the children saying they were desperate to do anything that would lift the spirits of the town.

The youngsters, who range from kindergarten to 8th grade, performed 'Over the Rainbow'.

They recorded the song with Ingrid Michaelson, Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz of Talking Heads, and copies are being sold on Amazon to raise funds for the Newtown Youth Academy.

Emotional moment: The children at the Super Bowl are all students at Sandy Hook Elementary School

Devoted: The children, from kindergarteners to 8th graders, have recording a single with Ingrid Michaelson to raise money for the town. They said they wanted to help the victims' families

The choir has since sung the national
 anthem at a recent New York Knicks game and will appear live via 
satellite at the Grammy Awards on Sunday.

'We're
 not doing it so we can sing on Grammys, though that's nice,' Post told 
the Courant. 'We’re doing it because we know we're doing 
something good for the town.

'I think it’s wonderful that the kids are being asked to give for kids, 
and using their music and talent to help other kids.'

The choir is also scheduled to perform at Radio City Music Hall in New York City in April.

New
 York producer Tim Hayes, who produced the Over the Rainbow project, has
 defended Post and the fundraising efforts. He said Robinson sent him an
 email to stop working with Post.

'I'm a little sad that someone's personal vendetta is muddying something that's completely transparent,' Hayes said. 'She attacked Sabrina and the integrity of 21 little kids.'

He added that Post does not deal with the fundraising money.

Some residents told the Courant they do not care that there is a second choir representing the town.

Monte Frank, whose children used to go to Sandy Hook Elementary, said he thought both choirs were fantastic.

'Seeing the Sandy Hook chorus at the Super Bowl made me really proud,' he said. 'And seeing [the other choir] sing Over the Rainbow… that made me really proud as well.'
