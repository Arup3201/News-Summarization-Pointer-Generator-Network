A Connecticut woman had an unfortunate brush with nature yesterday morning when she was bitten in the leg by a black bear while defending her dog - in her own backyard.

The ordeal began for Sharon Flannery of West Hartford when she had let her dog Maggie out at about 7:30am. She watched as the canine ran around but suddenly darted back into the house.

It wasn't long before she saw why - two black bear cubs and their protective mother were also in the yard - and the mother bear was chasing after Maggie.

Terrifying: Sharon Flannery calls her encounter with the black bear 'the scariest thing that happened to me'

Put down: The bear was later tested for rabies and euthanized. Her cubs were tranquilized and released into a wooded area

Ms Flannery told NBC Connecticut: 'It was definitely the scariest thing that happened to me. Before I even had time to process it was a bear, it was right in front of me.'

She said that the bear appeared to be trying to force its way into her home, so she had no choice but to fight back.

Ms Flannery told the station: 'I screamed and I yelled. It started poking its head in so I kicked it.'

The kick gave the woman time to retreat into her her house, where she called police.

Injuries: Sharon Flannery shows off her puncture wound next to her dog Maggie, who the bear chased to right to her door

The two cubs later ran up a tree in an adjacent yard with the bear. The mother bear was tested for rabies and later euthanized.

The cubs were tranquilized and released into a wooded area.

The mother bear's death riled many internet commenters, who argued that there could have been a better way to deal with the situation.

A Florida man called the Connecticut 
Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) 'absolute 
cowards' on their Facebook page.

Disturbing the peace: The bear and her cubs had wandered into Sharon Flannery's backyard, where it chased her dog

Flannery was taken to a nearby hospital, where she was treated for a puncture wound and scratches on her leg. Maggie was unharmed.

All three bears had previously been tagged by state wildlife officials.

Black bears generally avoid contact with people but can grow bolder if they regularly find food near houses.
