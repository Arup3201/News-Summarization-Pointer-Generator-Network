Thousands of jobless Brits living in Europe could be forced to return home under David Cameron's plan to reform EU welfare rules.

Downing Street yesterday warned that proposals to clamp down on so-called 'benefit tourists' would apply to unemployed British citizens living elsewhere in the European Union as well as EU migrants living here.

New research yesterday revealed that more than 30,000 British nationals are claiming unemployment and related benefits in countries around the EU.

An estimated 65,000 EU citizens claim similar benefits in the UK.

But Downing Street yesterday confirmed that they would also be affected by the Prime Minister's plan to curb migration from the EU by clamping down on benefits.

Under Mr Cameron's proposals, which were unveiled in November, EU citizens would face deportation if they failed to find a job within six months of moving to the UK. They would also be prevented from claiming in-work benefits in this country for four years.

The Prime Minister's Official Spokesman told reporters that Brits living abroad could expect to face a similar clampdown if he succeeds in his bid to change the EU's rules ahead of an In/Out referendum on Europe planned for 2017.

'The Prime Minister is seeking a number of changes to welfare rules linked to immigration.' The spokesman told reporters. 'There would be reciprocal changes across the EU.'

The Conservatives argue that curbing welfare will reduce the 'pull factors' that attract some EU citizens to come to Britain. Mr Cameron chose to pursue this route after German Chancellor Angela Merkel vetoed plans to directly curb the EU principle of free movement of people.

The decision to pursue a policy that will apply to unemployed Brits as well as EU citizens could result in a double benefit for the Conservatives, who have failed to deliver on Mr Cameron's pledge to cut net immigration to below 100,000 a year, as returning UK citizens would also count towards the target.

But critics are likely to question the economic value of forcing thousands of unemployed British citizens to return to this country to sign on.

The revelation follows new research by the Guardian newspaper yesterday revealing the extent of EU benefit tourism.

The study, based on responses from 23 of the EU's other 27 member states, suggests that more than 30,000 UK citizens are claiming unemployment benefits elsewhere in Europe.

More than a third of the total, some 11,222, live in Ireland, with the rest concentrated in Germany, France, Spain and Italy.

The number of Brits claiming benefits in these countries is higher than the number of their citizens on the dole here.

But the situation in many other EU countries is very different.

The research suggests some 14,880 Polish citizens are claiming Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) in the UK, compared with just two British citizens claiming similar benefits in Poland.

Some 4,880 Lithuanians claim JSA in Britain, while no British citizens at all are on the dole in Lithuania.

The study also found that no British citizens are claiming unemployment benefits in Romania, while 1,040 Romanians are on JSA here.

Other countries with large numbers of citizens claiming JSA in the UK include Slovakia, Portugal and the Czech Republic. In total they have almost 17,500 citizens on the benefit. By contrast, just 261 Brits are on the dole in these three countries.

In total, the study found that about 65,000 EU citizens are claiming JSA in the UK.
