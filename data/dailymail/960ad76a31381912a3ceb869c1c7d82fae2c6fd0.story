After a year roaming the surface of Mars, Nasa has failed to find any evidence that its atmosphere is supporting life, it was revealed today.

The Curiosity rover currently scanning the Red Planet has not detected any methane, a gas that is produced by living things.

Since landing in Gale Crater last year, every morning and evening the car-size probe has analysed Mars' air and scanned it with a tiny laser in search of the greenhouse gas.

Disappointment: The Curiosity rover has scanned Mars for methane every day but has not found any, which probably means it does not support life

Not finding it means that it is unlikely that microbes 
capable of producing the gas are living below the planet's surface,
 scientists said today.  

NASA had high hopes that the rover would inhale methane after 
orbiting spacecraft and Earth-based telescopes detected plumes of the 
gas several years ago.

On Earth, most of the gas is a by-product of 
life, spewed when animals digest or plants decay.

'If you had microbial life somewhere on Mars that was really healthy and
 cranking away, you might see some of the signatures of that in the 
atmosphere,' said mission scientist Paul Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Space
 Flight Center.

During Curiosity's first eight months on the red planet, it probed
the air during the day and at night as the season changed from spring to
 summer.

'Every time we looked, we never saw it,' said Christopher 
Webster, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who led the research 
published online in the journal Science.

Webster said while the 
result was 'disappointing in many ways,' the hunt for the elusive gas 
continues. While methane is linked to living things, it can also be made
 by non-biological processes.

Mars today is a hostile place - 
extremely dry and constantly bombarded by radiation. Billions of years 
ago, the planet boasted a thicker atmosphere and possible lakes. 
Scientists generally agree that nothing can exist on the Martian surface
 at present since it's too toxic. If there are living things on Mars, 
scientists theorize they're likely underground.

Just because 
Curiosity didn't detect methane near its landing site doesn't mean the 
gas is not present elsewhere on the planet, said Bill Nye, chief 
executive of the Planetary Society, a space advocacy group.

At work: Curiosity spends its time analysing all elements of Mars using a series of lasers and probes - but some results have been disappointing fo scientists on Earth

'Suppose
 you're an alien coming to Earth and you landed in the Four Corners 
area, would you feel as if you've explored the Earth?' he said.

Several
 years ago, scientists became excited at the prospect of 
methane-producing microbes after Michael Mumma of NASA's Goddard Space 
Flight Center noticed a mysterious belch of methane from three regions 
in Mars' western hemisphere.

Mumma, who had no role in the latest study, said he stood by his observations.

Earlier
 this month, Curiosity reached its first rest stop in its long trek 
toward Mount Sharp, a mountain rising from Gale Crater near the equator.
 The rover will take monthly readings of the Martian atmosphere during 
the road trip, expected to last almost a year.

Curiosity previously 
found evidence of an ancient environment that could have once been 
suitable for microscopic life. While the latest finding diminishes hope 
for present-day life, scientists still hope to uncover signs of ancient 
life by looking for organic compounds at the base of Mount Sharp.
