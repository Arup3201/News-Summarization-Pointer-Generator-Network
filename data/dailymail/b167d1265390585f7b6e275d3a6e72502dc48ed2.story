Juan Mata finished off a sumptuous move in some style as Manchester United beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield on Sunday.

The Spanish midfielder latched onto Angel di Maria's lofted pass, and twisted his body to volley a spectacular effort past despairing goalkeeper Simon Mignolet.

We're not calling it an 'overhead kick', but his finish was sublime. So, what other scissor kicks have we seen over the years?

The Spaniard's goal was the second of his double and secured a 2-1 victory for Louis van Gaal's side

Paolo di Canio (WEST HAM vs Wimbledon, 1999) 

As casual as it was genius. When Trevor Sinclair lifted the ball into the box, he would not have imagined the enigmatic Italian forward would have executed the volley to find the corner.

Di Canio's scissor kick flew past Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan, and deservedly won West Ham's player of the season award. His goal of the season gong for 1999/00 in the Premier League was no surprise, either.

The Italian forward's strike was named goal of the season in the 1999/00 Premier League campaign

Gus Poyet (CHELSEA vs Sunderland, 1999) 

Di Canio's effort wasn't the only scissor kick of that particular Premier League season. On the first day of the campaign, the Uruguayan midfielder sprinted to meet Gianfranco Zola's lofted pass and spectacularly volleyed home.

His goal was one of four at Stamford Bridge against the hapless Sunderland. And that wasn't the last time Black Cats fans would lose their cool with Poyet.

Guti (REAL MADRID vs Villarreal, 2001) 

Guti's scissor kick was one that we hadn't seen before, and haven't seen since. Standing upright, similar to Di Canio and Poyet, the Real Madrid star side foots his volley into the top corner.

The Bernabeu faithful have seen several special players this century, but not many goals as unique as this (3minutes, 10 seconds).

Mark Hughes (WALES vs Spain. 1985)

Wales 3-0 Spain. A day that will long live in the memories of Welsh supporters, thrashing the Euro 1984 runners-up in Wrexham. And not only was it an historic day for the team, Hughes' goal in his hometown will never be forgotten.

The ball spins back to the now-Stoke manager who acrobatically fires it home from shoulder-height, thundering into the top corner.

Dennis Bergkamp (INTER MILAN vs Rapid Bucharest, 1993)

Arsenal fans will have seen many special Bergkamp strikes in England over the years, but this effort in Italy may have gone under the radar.

In the last 32 of the UEFA Cup, the 24-year-old Dutch striker showed incredible technique from the edge of the box to divert this wayward pass into the bottom corner. 

Luis Suarez (BARCELONA vs Levante 2015) 

The former Liverpool striker has now forged his legacy at Barcelona with the winner in El Clasico on Sunday night, but as recently as last month, Suarez was struggling to hit top form at the Nou Camp.

This effort after Lionel Messi's dinked cross in a 5-0 victory helped things though, and he has scored seven goals since.

Sebastian Coates (LIVERPOOL vs QPR, 2012)

Coates has endeared himself to Liverpool fans defensively, and is now struggling on loan at Sunderland. So this acrobatic attempt against QPR certainly came out of the blue.

His first goal for the club, the centre half jogged up for a corner and his volley flew past Paddy Kenny in goal. However, his flaws at the back were later highlighted as the hosts at Loftus Road came back to win 3-2.

Yann Kermogant (BOURNEMOUTH vs Ipswich, 2014)

Down to the Championship now, and with runaway leaders Bournemouth. Four months ago, the Cherries took just 111 seconds to net first against Ipswich. 

French target man Kermogant lashed home a magnificent scissor kick, sending the Goldstands Stadium faithful wild.

Peter Crouch (LIVERPOOL vs Galatasaray, 2006)

The scissor kicks of all scissor kicks. Crouch's semi-overhead effort defied belief.

It was his 10th goal in eight starts for club and country, as Liverpool hung on to a 3-2 victory against the Turkish side in the Champions League. Steve Finnan will take credit with the assist...

Manuel Negrete (MEXICO vs Bulgaria, 1986) 

It doesn't get much better than scoring at the World Cup finals. 

After taking two touches to bring the ball down, Manuel Negrete fed Javier Aguirre and then met the quick return pass with a mesmeric left-foot volley which had the host nation in raptures.
