'It's been the worst week I've had. It's worse than childbirth, I think,' says Logandale resident Wynette Bodily.

Husband Kody Bodily says, '[We've had] pains, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, chills, shaking and aching all over.'

People in the town say residents became sick after a church potluck dinner was hosted on Saturday night. Locals say up to 200 people have fallen ill.

Officials with the Southern Nevada Health District called the outbreak 'isolated and not contagious.'

Potluck dinner: They  are often organized by religious or community groups, since they simplify the meal planning and distribute the costs among the participants but of course there's always a chance you could get sick

State health officials have been in the town all week, coordinating with hospitals and clergy at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

'We’ve worked very closely with organizers of the event. They’ve done a very good job of coordinating with those who participated in the event. We don’t believe any other members of the public are affected by this,' Nancy Williams, a spokeswoman for SNHD, told KTNV-TV.

Authorities have not determined which dish or dishes served at the dinner caused the outbreak and will not be testing any of the foods that were eaten that night because they were tossed in the trash after the dinner wrapped up.

'Our hearts go out, not only to the people that are sick, but those that are helping them,' church president Matt Messer told the station.

The exact number of reported cases will likely be released by the health district sometime early next week.
