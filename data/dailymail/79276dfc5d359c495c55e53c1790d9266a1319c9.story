Scott and Bailey, now in its third series, is a traditional detective show but also one about women with stressful jobs and imperfect home lives

Funny thing about severed heads: they’re more-ish, like Easter eggs. No sooner had we enjoyed Nigel Planer’s disembodied bonce, staring from underneath frosty eyebrows amid bags of frozen peas in Jonathan Creek on Monday night, than we were treated to another, on Scott And Bailey.

This was murder most foul-smelling. The police who discovered the body came reeling out of the house with their hands over their faces.

‘Body at the top of the stairs, head at the bottom, blood everywhere,’ choked one.

It was an old-fashioned whodunnit. The
 old lady, a heavy drinker, had not been alone when she died — but her 
husband Joe was bedridden, and apparently senile. ‘Joe couldn’t knock 
the skin off a rice pudding,’ insisted Sergeant Janet Scott (Lesley 
Sharp).

There were other 
suspects — and powerful motives. The couple’s four children had suffered
 years of sexual abuse — and one of them had been driving around her 
childhood streets on the night of the killing.

Nicola
 Walker stole the show as one of the daughters, a department store 
make-up saleswoman, who heard the news of her mother’s death with an 
impassive stare, but scene by scene dissolved into a dishevelled wreck.

It was an award-worthy performance, made more striking by the fact that we saw Walker on Tuesday as a daffy airhead in Sue Perkins’s sitcom Heading Out and last week as the cool-headed, gang-busting policewoman in Prisoners’ Wives.

Scott And Bailey, back for a third series, is a traditional detective show that can trace its heritage back to Dixon Of Dock Green: there’s even a blue ‘Police’ lamp in a station doorway during the opening credits.

But it’s also a show about ordinary women with stressful jobs and imperfect home lives. This wasn’t feminist, it was simply female: it even started with a good gossip in the ladies’ loo.

Later, DC Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones) was coming to terms with how boring her husband was, after the honeymoon had fizzled out. She knew he loved her, but he loved his Xbox, too . . . and he was so shallow there wasn’t much difference between the two emotions.

‘Women really are from Venus,’ Scott consoled her, ‘and men are from the planet Zog.’

As the new series of Coast, a celebration
 of this island race, began on BBC2, my prize for a woman who beat the 
men at their own game went to Rose Hanks. Rose was the first woman ever 
to ascend the podium of the Isle of Man TT motorbike races after riding 
to a sidecar victory beside husband Norman in 1968.

Coast is a 'celebration of this island race'

The camera recreated the bone-rattling circuit Rose and Norman had taken around the island’s winding moorland roads, and we saw archive stills of Rose, leaning so far out of the sidecar that she was almost surfing the Tarmac. Here she was — a true heroine.

Daredevilry was the order of the night. On Guernsey, presenter Nick Crane traced the history of the Napoleonic privateers, legalised pirates awarded a royal charter by George III to plunder French ships. ‘Privateering was a middle-class occupation,’ Crane explained, ‘whereas the Navy was for the upper classes.’

The pirate spirit lived on, during the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands after 1940. One survivor, Stanley Bochard, recalled how he and his schoolmates used to lob fistfuls of turf, like throwing hand grenades, out of a roadside ditch at the passing cars.

One sailed through an open window and hit a German officer full in the face. Brutal reprisals were avoided when Stanley’s headmaster ordered him to write a letter of apology to the Kommandant.

Heroism came to the fore again off the Norfolk coast during World War I, when Sopwith Camel biplanes were launched from boats at night. These were the earliest sort of aircraft carriers.

The captain would steer into a headwind, the pilot would rev his engine, and if there was enough breeze to lift the wings, the ropes securing the aeroplane to the boat would be cut.

Sometimes the plane would flip into the sea, sometimes the pilot would be aloft, reading his instrument panels by torchlight and hunting for Zeppelin airships. I suspect Rose Hanks, Queen of the TT, would have loved it.
