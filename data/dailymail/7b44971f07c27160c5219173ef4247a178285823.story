Brendan Rodgers has been spotted on holiday enjoying the sights of New York while his Liverpool players play out different fortunes at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

The Liverpool manager was pictured arm-in-arm with Charlotte Hind, Liverpool's former travel manager on the day England faced Uruguay in Sao Paulo.

That game saw Luis Suarez line up for Uruguay against club-mates including Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge, Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling.

Tussle: Rodgers could face a fight to keep hold of star striker Luis Suarez upon his return to Liverpool

Suarez scored twice to lead Uruguay to a 2-1 win over England, a result which ended the Three Lions' participation in the tournament.

Meanwhile, Rodgers was photographed with Ms. Hind escaping about the potential transfer saga regarding Suarez which could await him on his return to Liverpool.

The striker has been linked with a move to La Liga giants Barcelona and Real Madrid and could spark a Â£100million tug-of-war for his services.

Rivalry: Liverpool team-mates Steven Gerrard and Luis Suarez faced off at the 2014 World Cup

Last summer Rodgers stood firm as Arsenal and Real Madrid tested Liverpool's resolve over the striker, but was handsomely rewarded as Suarez scored 31 goals, helped the club finish second in the Premier League and scooped the PFA Player of the Year award.

There is uncertainty if Liverpool can hold on to their prized asset for a second summer in a row though, despite qualifying for the Champions League.

Liverpool begin their pre-season preparations with a trip to Brondby on July 16, three days after the World Cup final.

They then face Preston at Anfield on July 19, before embarking on a tour of the United States which will include games against Roma, Manchester City and AC Milan.

They finish their pre-season with a game against Borussia Dortmund at Anfield on August 10 before hosting Southampton on the opening weekend of the Premier League season.

In demand: Suarez has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Real Madrid this summer

Time out: For now, though, Rodgers is making the most of his time off before Liverpool return to pre-season
