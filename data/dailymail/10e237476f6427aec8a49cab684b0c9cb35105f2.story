A holiday company in Wiltshire will be a little more cautious about renting out one of their narrowboats to stag parties after this weekend.

A vessel hired by a group of men from Wales capsized on Saturday as the party tried to navigate the Kennet and Avon Canal near Widcombe.

Stranded: The boat was photographed at a 30 degree angle with one end submerged under water

The Yellow Weaver was negotiating Lock 11 at around 2pm when the incident happened.

The water in the lock drained away but the boat was stuck on the sill and it rolled over.

Luckily all of the men on board managed to escape uninjured.

The group had rented the boat from Alvechurch Waterway Holidays at Hilperton Marina in Trowbridge, Wiltshire.

Passer-by Paul Clements watched the drama unfold. He said: ‘It hooked its stern on the gate ledge and tilted forward as the water was let out of the lock. The guy panicked and jumped off as it rolled over.’

The Canal and River Trust posted a photograph on Twitter showing the boat at a 30 degree angle with one end submerged under water.

The Trust said the narrowboat would be lifted out of the canal by crane tomorrow at the earliest.

No-one can get in and out of Bath through this stretch of canal - 650 yards (600 metres) between Bath Bottom Lock to Bath Top Lock - until it is cleared.

A spokesman for the Trust said that the firm had launched an investigation.

He said: ‘Unfortunately it was one of ours but thankfully nobody was hurt. We don't want to say too much at the moment because we're still investigating it.’

The Kennet and Avon Canal is one of the most popular broad canals on the network, passing through pretty villages and towns, including Bradford-on-Avon, Bath and Bristol.

Boat tourism contributed £626 million to the West Country economy last year and a report published in February showed boating tourism accounted for 16,339 full-time jobs in the West economy.
