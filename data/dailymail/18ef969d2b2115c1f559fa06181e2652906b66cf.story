England look about as likely to win the World Cup as Manchester United do the Premier League after another abject performance at Trent Bridge which advertised their long-standing one-day weaknesses in all their infamy.

An England team that were so dominant by the end of the Test series have been made to look like limited-overs novices in two thrashings by a rejuvenated India who have simply come alive in coloured clothing. How can a change of format herald such a transformation of fortunes for an England side who once again looked out-dated, devoid of imagination and flair and unable to force the pace against even a moderately spinning ball?

It is a mystery which leaves Alastair Cook with much to ponder at the start of an intensive run of 50-over matches which is supposed to provide the perfect preparation for a tilt at a World Cup which England have never won.

‘It’s not a question of our strategy,’ insisted Cook. ‘It’s the fact that there are some good players there who are not showing it. It’s frustrating that we’re not playing to the standards we’re capable of.

‘Everyone keeps talking about more power at the top but we’re getting good starts. The problem is our top scores have been in the 40s and we need bigger runs than that at the top of the order.’

The one consolation from a six-wicket defeat that India completed with 42 balls to spare is that conditions at Trent Bridge, not to mention much of the support, were far more Mumbai than what awaits them in Melbourne.

India, who looked spent after being thrashed 3-1 in the Test series, were made to feel right at home by at least 60 per cent of spectators supporting them, the loud booing of Jimmy Anderson whenever he went near the ball and a pitch which again raises questions.

Notts groundsman Steve Birks was under pressure after his lifeless surface for the first Test last month but here he produced another slow turner which did little to provide either entertainment or ‘home’ conditions.

Yet the pitch is no excuse for an England side capable of losing one-day games anywhere, not least when the world champions are in such irresistible form six months before their title defence in Australia and New Zealand.

England’s collapse from the bright start provided by Cook and Alex Hales to a woefully under par 227 all out as soon as they faced spin could have happened at any time in the last 20 years, so perennial are their limited-overs limitations. All MS Dhoni, who has looked a different captain in the one-day arena, seemingly had to do was throw the ball to part-time spinners Suresh Raina and Ambati Rayudu and England’s decline was on.

Once the occasional bowlers had claimed a wicket each, Dhoni threw the ball to Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja and that decline became terminal, England crashing from 82 without loss to 182 for seven.

Nothing sums up the feeble nature of England’s batting than the fact that only one four was hit between the 18th and the 44th overs while the form of their key one-day batsman Eoin Morgan is one of the biggest causes for concern. Add Joe Root’s wretched one-day form and it is clear the batting mountain England must climb now resembles Kilimanjaro.

Decisions: Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the toss and elected to bowl first for India

Intent: England captain  Cook put on 82 runs for the first wicket with Alex Hales

Breakthrough: Hales was the first man to fall when he was caught by Dhoni off Suresh Raina for 42

Looking back with anger: Captain Cook was stumped for 44 by India captain Dhoni as England lost their way

England are expected to include Jason Roy and Chris Wood for their squad for the one-off Twenty20 international against India at Edgbaston next Sunday.

Hard-hitting Surrey batsman Roy and Hampshire left-arm seamer Wood look likely to be handed their debuts in an England side that will be captained by Eoin Morgan.

At a time when 300 has become little more than par in one-day cricket England have reached those lofty heights no more than four times in their last 37 internationals, the most damning statistic of all.

Neither spin nor pace posed many problems for India, with Steven Finn struggling to make an impact in his first appearance for England in just under a year.

It was largely plain sailing for India but there was a reminder of the acrimony that goes back to the incident between Anderson and Jadeja during the first Test when Virat Kohli was given a send-off by England and responded by pointing his bat at Anderson and Ben Stokes. Umpires Paul Reiffel and Michael Gough had words with both Stokes and captain Cook. 

Whipped off: Joe Root feel for just two runs as he was stumped by Dhoni from Ravi Jadeja's bowling

Snick: Eoin Morgan was gone for 10 when he edged behind off Ravi Ashwin to leave England 120-4

Short: Ian Bell (left) was run out with a direct hit from the deep by Mohit Sharma (right)

Direct hit: Raina celebrates after Sharma's throw from the deep crashed into the stumps and left Bell short

Otherwise there was little to be excited about, Rayudu completing his perfect day with an unbeaten 64 as India took a 2-0 lead with two to play in a series which has brought England back to earth with a thud.

‘We can turn this round quickly but it starts with individual responsibility,’ added Cook. ‘It will take someone to score a hundred and everyone will jump on the back of that, we will score 330 and things will change.’

That will take some doing as, to coin a phrase beloved of Graeme Swann, England would not appear to have a ‘cat in hell’s chance’ of emerging with even a share of this series, let alone a stab at the biggest prize in one-day cricket next February. They need a huge improvement at Edgbaston on Tuesday.

Inspiration: Raina pulled off a stunning low catch at slip to dismiss Ben Stokes for just two runs

Delight: Raina celebrates his catch with Dhoni to leave England in trouble at 149-6

Cameo: Jos Buttler's 42 down the order helped England limp past 200 at Trent Bridge

The end: Steven Finn was run out off the last ball as England scored just 227

First blow: Chris Woakes dismissed Shikhar Dhawan early when the Indian cut straight to Morgan at point

In the wickets: Finn returned to the team and ended Ajinkya Rahane's steady innings of 45

Exchange: Virat Kohli looks back in anger after being dismissed by Ben Stokes for 40

Home and dry: Rayudu's unbeaten 64 guided India to victory with seven overs to spare at Trent Bridge

Baffled: Woakes, Jimmy Anderson and Cook look short of ideas as England are thrashed again
