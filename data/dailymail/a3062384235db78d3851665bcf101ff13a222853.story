Ms Moore, who arrived a day later than her colleague, checking in on May 17, stayed for six nights at a cost of £1,187.88.

Mr Cohen's stay received a £25.66 credit from the hotel, while Ms Moore had a £21.98 credit.

Mr Cohen and Ms Moore were staying at the hotel for the LA Screenings where hundreds of top television buyers from across the world arrive in California to watch  the US TV networks' new shows and potentially buy the international rights to them.

While in Los Angeles for the annual screenings, they are also understood to have taken part in meetings with other international broadcasters and with potential co-producers.

Destination: The hotel boasts of offering '3.5 acres of Mediterranean oasis', located just off the famed Sunset Strip, and claims to be the place where the phrase 'Party like a rock star' was invented

The hotel bills itself 'as the home away from home for actors, comedians, writers, artists, filmmakers, fashion designers, supermodels, restaurateurs, billionaire entrepreneurs, and the newest breed of entertainer when the hotel opened its doors in 1963: rock stars.'

It boasts of offering '3.5 acres of Mediterranean oasis', located just off the famed Sunset Strip, and claims to be the place where the phrase 'Party like a rock star' was invented.

The hotel even has a Stay & Play package which offers guest the use of the EG-1 Traveler Guitar, in case any visiting rock stars have left their at home, and says there is room to park a tour bus in its underground car park 'if you happen to have one'. 

Sunset Marquis, which was recently renovated to mark its 50th year in business, was built by real estate developer George Rosenthal and opened in 1963.

Among those who have used the hotel as a home from home are Jeff Beck, Bruce Springsteen, Steven Tyler, Gene Hackman and Elton John while, according to the hotel website, Neil Diamond used to perform by the pool to pay his bill.

U2 have also stayed at the hotel, while singer Harry Connick Jnr reportedly met his wife, former Victoria's Secret model Jill Goodacre at one of the venue's two hotel pools.

Today, hotel features 154 suites and villas, as well as a restaurant, spa and even a recording studio, while the hotel describes how it 'continues to attract new stars like Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and various American Idol winners'.

Its advertised rates range from $305 (£195) for a standard room, to $2,000 for a two-bedroom villa, which features a dining area for up to eight and an oversized marble, granite and tiled bathrooms with an oversized bath tub - meaning that the BBC managed to make a saving with a special rate.

There is also the two-storey 'Presidential villa', which has its own private screening room and a semi-private elevator. 

A BBC spokesman told MailOnline: 'We're the world’s largest public service broadcaster, broadcast in 28 languages and have staff in 85 cities around the world – so it's unsurprising that our executives sometimes travel internationally and value for money is always a priority.'
