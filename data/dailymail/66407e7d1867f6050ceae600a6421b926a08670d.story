Choosing the perfect ski destination can be a tricky prospect. Especially if you want to take your family.

The first instinct is to think about the Alps. But if you want to go away in February half-term - which we did - then the snowiest parts of France, Italy and Austria can be busy. And a little expensive.

We happened upon an alternative. Norway.

Fill your snow boots: Norway can be an inexpensive alternative to the Alps

The slopes are snow-sure well into April, prices are reasonable and families are exceptionally well catered for. My wife and I have two children, Maisie, five and Imogen, three. That's young to start skiing, but I was told that Trysil would do the trick.

After an easy transfer from Oslo airport, we arrived at the Radisson Blu, one of two ski-in ski-out hotels. There is ten-pin bowling, an American-style diner, a soft play area and a vast multi-pool swimming area that would prove to be a huge hit with my lot. It is also right by the nursery slopes - our first morning found us riding the magic carpet to ski school.

Maisie was in a class of five, Imogen was with three others. And by a happy quirk, they were being taught by two sisters, both delightful.

By the second day, she was riding the mini drag lift and Imogen was padding around on her skis, searching for stuffed toy lions and monkeys around the kids area.

Easy does it: Trysil can be a perfect ski destination for families with young children

By the end of the week, both were skiing better than I could have hoped.

Trysil has four main ski areas, all with excellent nursery slopes - with easy routes down from all points. The ski school also runs a drop-in creche from 10.45am to 3pm for £8 an hour per child, with a 30 per cent discount for siblings. We used this for our own ski time.

The slopes are surprisingly extensive. Hogegga is an area with mostly black runs - and new for this season is the first of a series of new gladed trails through woods.

Skihytta is a charming mountain hut serving its own beers, and moose shot by the owner. Knettsettra is another must-visit mid-mountain restaurant and bar. It hosts free concerts for up to 5,000 people in March and April.

The one sting in the tail is the cost of alcohol. A draft half-litre of beer cost me £6.50 and a bottle of wine £35. But the well-priced food balanced this out over the week.

And it was not just about the skiing.

We also took the girls dog-sledding across a beautifully scenic plateau, and our highlight of the week was a horse sleigh ride with a stop-off in a Nordic yurt to cook hot dogs over an open fire.

The girls definitely developed a taste for skiing, and we have a new love affair with Trysil. We are already thinking about going back for half-term next year. Roll on February 2016.

Slopes tend to be less crowded than in France, and are snow-sure to April

Plenty of nursery slopes mean (very) young skiers can also feel at home
