Guests at a christening were in for a surprise when the parents interrupted the baptism of their son to get married.

The vicar told guests that she had an announcement as they filled the pews at St Nicholas Church in Husthwaite, North Yorkshire, for the christening of four-month-old Harry Thornton. 

Best man Jimmy Derham, a former jockey, and wedding photographer Robert Smith were in on the surprise. 

Surprise!   
Yvonne Dennis and Andrew Thornton, surprised the 80 guests at their baby son Harry's Christening at St. Nicholas' Church in Husthwaite, North Yorkshire, when they told the congregation they were also getting married

Even the couple's parents did not know about the secretly planned wedding, and shocked guests broke out into applause as the vicar told the congregation that florist Yvonne Dennis and jockey Andrew Thornton, the baby's parents, would actually be getting married first. 

The couple were happily married and the vicar then moved on to Harry's christening. 

'There was a massive applause and it was lovely - there were a few shocked faces,' said the new Mrs Thornton. 

'The vicar knew and so did the photographer, who was a friend and was sworn to secrecy. I had to tell him because I wanted him to capture people's faces.'

Secret: Even the couple's parents did not know about the secretly planned wedding, and shocked guests broke out into applause as the vicar told the congregation the good news

The 80 guests went to the couple's home in Rainton afterwards for a party. 

Although the couple have known each other since they were seven years old, they have been in a relationship for just over three years. There were no elaborate table decorations, wedding presents, sit-down meals or any organised entertainment, even though Yvonne is a professional wedding florist. 

Fuss-free wedding: The couple were happily married and the vicar then moved on to Harry's christening. Wedding florist Yvonne didn't want a frilly wedding and kept it simple

Yvonne said: 'I'm a wedding florist - I have been in the industry for about 23 years. I just see weddings week in week out and I didn't want all the frills and spill; just a really personal party and to focus on just getting married.  

'We both know hundreds and hundreds of people - especially through Andrew's job - and just thought we could get carried away with inviting 400 people easily. We didn't want to offend anybody by missing them out, so this way it was kept very personal with closest and oldest friends.'

Her new jockey husband Andrew Thornton, 41, has won nearly 1000 races including King George VI Chase, the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Scottish and Welsh Grand Nationals. 

The newlyweds' honeymoon was a trip to Sedgefield Racecourse on Tuesday where her husband was racing that day.
