Millions globally have expressed their solidarity with the victims of the Charlie Hebdo terror attack.

And now, 'The Simpsons' has unveiled its own touching tribute to the magazine's slain employees.

In a short clip at the end of Sunday night's episode, which aired on Fox, a somber animation of baby Maggie standing in front of a red, white and blue background flashed onto the screen. 

In her tiny hand, she was holding a flag emblazoned with the words, 'Je Suis Charlie' - the slogan that has gone viral following last week's attack on the satirical publication's Paris headquarters.

The episode - 'Bart's Best Friend', written by Judd Apatow almost 25 years ago - was broadcast at the same time as celebrities were paying tribute to the terror victims at the Golden Globes.

Twelve people, including two police officers and five staff cartoonists, were gunned down when two Islamist gunmen stormed the magazine's offices last Wednesday and opened fire. 

The following day, a French policewoman was shot dead in France's capital. And on Friday, four hostages were killed when another Islamist terrorist seized a Jewish grocery store.

Within minutes of 'The Simpsons's' tribute airing, people across America were taking to social media to applaud the program for showing its support for freedom of expression in the wake of the attacks.
