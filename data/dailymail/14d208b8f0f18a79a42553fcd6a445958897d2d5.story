Debt collectors are chasing thousands of students who have moved abroad without repaying their loans, it was revealed yesterday.

About 16,000 British and 7,000 EU graduates are living overseas and in arrears with the Student Loan Company (SLC) – contributing to a projected £330billion debt by 2044.

The Government said it had funded a pilot project to extend the ‘use of Debt Collection processes overseas for those seeking to evade their responsibility’.

Ministers are also considering ‘allocating additional resources needed to roll out wider debt collection processes’ abroad.

Details of the clampdown were revealed as Ministers yesterday refused demands to hold an ‘urgent’ review of the student loans system.

The Commons’ Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) Committee warned in July that the scheme was at ‘tipping point’ because of bungled Government sums and lax debt collection. The Coalition loses 45 pence in every pound it lends to student.

In a formal response to the committee, the Government yesterday insisted there was ‘no immediate pressure’ in the system.

It admitted that debt recovery ‘becomes difficult when borrowers move overseas without either informing the SLC or establishing a repayment schedule’.

Its report added: ‘We are investigating options to make repayment even easier for those overseas, and have funded a pilot project to extend the use of Debt Collection processes overseas for those seeking to evade their responsibility.

‘If this pilot is deemed successful, and cost effective, then BIS will consider allocating additional resources needed to roll out wider debt collection processes.

‘We are also in discussion with several countries to develop mutual processes for identifying overseas nationals who are not making the Higher Education loan repayments which are due.’

Adrian Bailey (pictured), chair of the BIS Committee, said the size of outstanding student debt will increase to more than £330bn by 2044

The report pointed out that the ‘majority’ of borrowers who are overseas are UK nationals

The SLC already takes ‘targeted action’ to set up repayment schedules for EU borrowers who are ‘more likely’ to move overseas.

However, a study from the National Audit Office last November claimed that 42,000 EU graduates are eligible to make repayments but 18,000 – 43 per cent – are failing to do so.

Of those, 7,000 are formally ‘in arrears’ and living abroad, while 11,000 remain in the UK without providing earnings information. Some of these may be under the repayment threshold or not in work but no details exist about them.

At the same time, 2,928,000 UK students are eligible to make repayments. Of those, 383,000 are failing to provide earnings information and 16,000 are living abroad and in arrears. This non-repayment rate is 13.7 per cent.

Graduates must alert the SLC if they plan to leave the country for longer than three months, enabling a repayment schedule to be drawn up.

The SLC started using overseas collection agents from 2011 onwards. It passes on account details of non-payers so they can be tracked down, such as through their equivalents of the electoral register.

The government pilot project extends these arrangements.

A SLC spokeswoman said: ‘Student Loans Company (SLC) has a robust system to pursue borrowers for repayment regardless of their location.

‘A part of this collection process includes engagement with overseas collections agents to ensure all funds owed are recouped. Due to the success of this process, we have worked to secure funding to extend the use of the overseas collection agents.’

Adrian Bailey, chair of the BIS Committee, said yesterday: ‘Under the current student loan system for students residing in England, the Government loses around 45p on every £1 it loans out.

‘The Government’s own estimates indicate the size of outstanding student debt will increase to more than £330bn by 2044.

‘With the prospect of a large potential black hole in the government’s budget figures, it is all the more alarming that the Government has refused to conduct a review of the current student loan system.’
