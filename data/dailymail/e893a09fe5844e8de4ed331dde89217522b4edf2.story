A transgender teenager is finally enjoying life as a woman after defying religious protests against her sexuality.

Leah Walton, 19, from Mississippi, U.S., was the victim of protests against her transition on her first day at school dressed as a woman.

She was greeted at school gates by fellow students and parents wearing T-shirts with slogans such as 'You're going to hell' and 'Abomination'.

But despite the continued abuse, Leah has refused to stop living as a woman.

Before and after: Dylan Walton was born a boy, but realised early on in life that he wanted to be a girl. When he was around 17 years old, he started dressing as a woman (right) at school and called himself Leah

Defying the bullies: Back in the classroom, Leah had to face a lot of stares and whispers from her classmates

Leah says: 'I was so upset that they were being so ignorant and closed-minded. I felt so frightened that I took a few days off school to gather myself.

'To cope with my fear, I had to build a wall around myself for a little while, but gradually my self-confidence improved.

'I'm so grateful to my mum. She was one of my biggest supporters and helped me through those difficult few days.

'When I went back to school, some people I didn't even know were coming up to me and congratulating me. 

'They said I was so brave to face the protesters as the real me.'

Back in the classroom, Leah had to face a lot of stares and whispers from her classmates.

She says: 'When I walked down the corridor, I could tell that a lot of people were looking at me. Some girls would even laugh and take pictures of me on their phones.

'But the bullies never had the courage to say anything to my face, and my friends were all there for me.

Leah was born a boy named Dylan, but always felt unhappy in her body.

At the age of seven, mum Kim Hood, 42, caught Leah wearing her lipstick, whilst doing an impression of Britney Spears.

'My mum was angry and told me that boys don't do that,' she says. 'I promised myself I'd never wear girls' clothes or make-up again.'

But by age 13, Leah's feelings had escalated.

With her larger frame and high-pitched voice, she didn't feel like she fitted in with the other boys.

Confused about her feelings, she came out to her family as gay.

But three years later, at the age of 16, Leah made a discovery online that changed everything.

She says: 'I was on YouTube when I saw the most beautiful transgendered woman I had ever seen.

'She had glamorous platinum-blonde hair extensions, and she was wearing a bodycon dress with a push-up bra.

'From that moment, I knew I had to become the woman I was always meant to be.'

And a month later, Leah told her mum, who supported her decision.

Leah had to attend counselling sessions, where she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria.

At 17, Leah started a course of hormones, including estradiol, and bought a wig. She also changed her name via deed poll.

She says: 'I was so excited to become Leah, I could hardly wait.

'I was living with my grandmother at the time, and she was worried that I would get bullied, but I just didn't care.'

With the help of her mother Kim Hood (centre), and the American Civil Liberties Union, an organisation that defends the civil rights of Americans, Leah persuaded the school to let her dress as a woman

Outside of school, Leah could finally embrace her true identity, but at school, she still wore baggy jeans and hoodies.

During Christmas 2012, Leah wrote to her school, South Panola High School, Mississippi, asking permission to dress as a woman.

Shockingly, they told her that they had never heard of transgender, and that school policy stated she had to dress for her gender.

'I was distraught,' Leah says. 'I had six months of school left, and I couldn't bear to face them in baggy jeans and a hoody.

'I just wanted to be the real me.'

With the help of her mum, and the American Civil Liberties Union, a non-profit organisation that defends the civil rights of Americans, Leah managed to persuade the school to allow her to dress as a woman.

She says: 'People were angry because they thought I was getting special treatment, but I told them I was just fighting for my right to express my true identity.'

Leah, who has been living as a woman for two years, is now working at a deli and saving for gender reassignment surgery, which will cost around $25,000 (£16,000).

Leah says: 'My life has been a bit of a rollercoaster, but things are finally starting to settle down. I have a job and a wonderful group of friends.

'I'm now hoping to have my surgery before I am 22.

'Looking back, I don't regret a thing. I only wish my grandmother was still alive, so that she could see how far I've come. She would be so happy to see how I faced the bullies and won.

'All of the names I was called and all of the stares don't mean anything. I'm finally the person I want to be, and no one can take that away from me.'

In April this year, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed into law in Mississippi, protecting religious people from legal repercussions if they verbally condemn the lifestyle of LGBT persons.

Leah says: 'I think it's crazy. I've heard of people being refused service in restaurants because of their sexuality, but it shouldn't matter who you are!'

South Panola High School was approached for comment regarding Leah's treatment, but no response has been provided.
