Rihanna was rushed to hospital after partying at the Met Gala in New York on Monday night.

The You Da One hitmaker tweeted a picture of herself attached to an IV drip in a hospital.

She was suffering from 'exhaustion and dehydration', according to MediaTakeOut.

However,
after a brief stay in the undisclosed medical center, she was 
discharged and allowed to fly back to her home in Los Angeles, arriving 
in California earlier this morning.

It comes just days after the 24-year-old singer pulled out of a Saturday Night Live rehearsal due to her tiredness.

The star has certainly been burning the candle at both ends in recent months and the new issue of America's Star magazine claims she is 'spiralling out of control'.

'Rihanna loves to party but this past month she's gotten really out of control,' an insider tells the publication. 'She's been drinking almost everyday and talking about smoking weed a lot too.'

Platonic: Darren McFadden has been linked to Rihanna but they are just friends

Her wild nights out have included a late visit to a strip club in Queens, New York, on May 2 where she was seen throwing money at female performers.

'Everyone is telling her to slow down and think about therapy, or even rehab,' the source continues.

But Rihanna has always been proud of her Good Girl Gone Bad reputation.

She has said: 'I'm crazy and I don't pretend to be anything else.'

Meanwhile, the singer has denied she is dating NFL player Darren McFadden who plays for the Oakland Raiders.

The couple were reported to have been 'making out' in Hawaii two weeks ago, according to TMZ.

But sources close to Rihanna told the website that, although the singer did indeed meet Darren in Honolulu while she was promoting her new movie Battleship, the pair are just friends.

Darren was 'with his girlfriend,' according to the website, and introduced himself to Rihanna as a fan, before the singer bought them both drinks.
