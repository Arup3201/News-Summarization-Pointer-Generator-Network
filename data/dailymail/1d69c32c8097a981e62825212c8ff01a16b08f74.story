Prime Minister David Cameron, on a visit to Yateley in Hampshire today, has insisted he will not resign if Scotland votes Yes

Parliament could be recalled as early as Saturday, if Scotland votes for independence.

David Cameron will come under immediate pressure to address the nation if the Union is torn up by Thursday's historic vote.

The final result is expected around 7am on Friday morning, which means MPs could be summoned to Westminster this weekend for the most important speech of Mr Cameron's premiership. 

There has been growing speculation that if Scotland does vote for independence, Mr Cameron will have to resign, as the Prime Minister who oversaw the break-up of the Union.

However, some economists fear a vote for independence could trigger a run on banks and a stock market crash.

So Mr Cameron's first job will be to steady the ship and provide leadership to calm the markets.

Many Tory MPs now say it is 'inevitable' that Parliament will be recalled this weekend, raising the prospect of the first Saturday sitting since the Falklands War. 

Previous Saturday sittings were ordered on the outbreak of World War Two in September 1939, the last summer sitting in July 1949 and the Suez Crisis in November 1956.

A weekend debate in the Commons would be a chance for the Westminster government to set out how it will deal with Alex Salmond, and carving up the UK's assets, at a time when stock markets are closed.

However, the move risks giving Tory MPs and others the opportunity to publicly call for Mr Cameron to resign.

During the final Prime Minister's Questions before the referendum, Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh warned Mr Cameron: 'If we were to lose the Union, it would be not only a disaster for Scotland, but a national humiliation of catastrophic proportions.'

Today Mr Cameron signalled that he will resist calls to quit. Speaking to reporters during a visit to a factory in Fleet, Hampshire, he said he was determined to fight on to next year's general election.

'My name is not on the ballot paper. What's on the ballot paper is 'does Scotland want to stay in the United Kingdom, or does Scotland want to separate itself from the United Kingdom?'.

'That's the only question that will be decided on Thursday night. The question about my future will be decided at the British general election coming soon.' 

With the opinion polls on a knife-edge, there is dismay among Tory MPs at the prospect of a possible Yes vote.

Even if the result is in favour of remaining part of the UK, some Conservative are angry at the way the three main party leaders have promised greater devolution of powers to Scotland while continuing higher levels of public spending.

It would be the first time the Commons has been recalled on a Saturday since the Falklands War, and would be used to reassure the financial markets about the impact of the break up of the UK

With less than 24 hours to go until the polling stations open, 350,000 voters still don't know who to support

Mr Cameron sought to play down suggestions of backbench unrest, saying that the whole party believed in 'our family of nations'.

'The Conservative Party and all our backbenchers want to see the United Kingdom survive and thrive,' he said.

The Prime Minister admitted that he was feeling 'nervous' ahead of the vote, but insisted that he was confident about the case for a No vote.

'Well of course everyone who cares about our United Kingdom - and I care passionately about our United Kingdom - is nervous,' he said.

'But I'm confident that we've set out how Scotland can have the best of both worlds - a successful economy with a growing number of jobs ... combined with the ability of Scots if they vote No to have even more powers and even more say over how to run their own affairs in Scotland.'

Banks have been transferring millions of banknotes from England into Scotland ahead of tomorrow's referendum amidst fears high demand on cash machines if the country votes for independence.

It is still not clear what currency would be used in an independent Scotland, meaning that some Scots could rush to withdraw as many pounds as possible in the event of a Yes vote.

In anticipation of the poll, extra supplies of cash have been moved north of the border to reassure Scottish account-holders that they will have access to their money, according to reports.

As the polls have tightened over the past few weeks, the value of the pound has fallen while large companies based in Scotland have seen their shares dip due to the market uncertainty.

Banking sources told the Independent that they had transferred additional banknotes into Scotland in case customers started panicking and withdrawing large amounts of cash.

One said: 'This forms part of our contingency planning. We are, of course, monitoring the situation very closely from hour to hour.'

Another insider told the Daily Telegraph: 'It is prudent for banks to stock up on demand. This happens normally in the run-up to Christmas, and in that sense the referendum is no different.'

Banknotes are printed by the Bank of England, but their distribution is controlled by a small group of institutions including the Post Office, Barclays, HSBC and the Royal Bank of Scotland.

They have been delivering huge quantities of cash to banks in Scotland so they can stock up at branches and cash machines.

However, the Bank of England would stand behind the pound in Scotland as well as the rest of the UK at least until March 2016, when the country is set to split in the event of a Yes vote.

In another attempt to reassure banking customers, financial institutions such as the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds have promised to move their headquarters to London if Scotland becomes independent, so they can enjoy the support of the UK Government.
