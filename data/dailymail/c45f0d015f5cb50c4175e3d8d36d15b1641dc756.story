A new baby boom of Hispanic, Asian and black children is coming to America - and it will make whites a minority by 2050.

The surge is not due to new immigrants coming to the United States - but instead stems from the immigrants who are already here having children, according to Brookings Institution demographer William Frey.

His new book, Diversity Explosion, recounts how falling white birth rates and rising birth rates for minorities will change way the United States of America looks - and votes - forever. 

Baby boom: By 2050, minorities will outnumber whites - thanks to shrinking birth rates for white families and growing birth rates non-whites

Go east, young man: Hispanics are moving rapidly from the southwest and California eastward and through the South (green dots)

Diverse Midwest: The Midwest, Florida and southeastern US have all also see a large increase in the Asian population

Integration by marriage: Biracial families will become dramatically more as more and more people find love outside their own races. Fifteen percent of all new marriages are multiracial 

There are already nearly as many non-white babies being born as white children, according to Census Bureau statistics. It's only a matter of time before minorities children outnumber white ones. 

The result, Frey tells the Atlantic, will be very similar to the Baby Boom after the Second World War - except this time it will be minority children being born.

'Back in the 1950s, we had a lot of Americans across the board in their childbearing years - we had all these babies,' he said. 

'Now, that's really only the case for some of the newer minorities.'

And it's not just cities that will be changing. The suburbs are already becoming more diverse and are likely to become progressively less white year after year. 

Between 2000 and 2010, the population of Hispanics in suburbs grew by more than eight million. Major cities added just three million Hispanics. 

Even among black Americans, the population of suburban dwellers is growing. In the last decade, the population of suburban blacks grew by three million and the population of urban blacks shrank by several hundred thousand. 

Mixed race: In the next 40 years, the number of mixed race Americans will nearly triple, the number of Asians will double and the number of whites will decline by six percent

Hispanics, blacks and Asians are all moving to the suburbs in greater numbers than whites

The influx of blacks to suburbs is also cutting the segregation in America as neighborhoods outside the city core become more diverse

Suburban sprawl: The number of blacks moving to suburbs has skyrocketed. Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Miami and Washington, DC, are the top cities where black Americans leaving city centers

Headed back South: Two generations after black families fled segregation and poverty in the South, they are beginning to move back. The population of blacks in Atlanta has grown dramatically in recent decades

White birth rates are falling while immigrants and other minorities are having more children

The population surge comes from immigrants having children in the US - not directly from immigration

Minorities are also moving to the suburbs at faster rates, ensuring they are getting more diverse

The population of mixed race Americans will grow dramatically in the next 50 years - nearly tripling
