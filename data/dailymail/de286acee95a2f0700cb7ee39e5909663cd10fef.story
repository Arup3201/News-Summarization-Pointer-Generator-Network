They say having sex gives you a spring in your step - and it seems it's actually true.

Belgian researchers watched videos of women walking, and were able to tell whether they regularly had orgasms from intercourse.

At the Universiti Catholique de Louvain, Institut d'itudes de la famille et de la sexualiti, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, they set about proving the theory right.

They took women with known histories 
of either vaginal orgasm or inability to orgasm from sex and videotaped 
them walking on the street, and their orgasmic status was judged by 
sexologists blind to their history.

‘In the sample of healthy young 
Belgian women, half of whom were vaginally orgasmic, history of vaginal 
orgasm that was triggered solely by penile-vaginal intercourse, was 
diagnosable at far better than chance.

The researchers think that, as well as having an effect on people's mental health, orgasms can 'loosen' muscle groups.

They wrote: ‘Research has demonstrated the association between vaginal orgasm and better mental health. Some theories of psychotherapy assert a link between muscle blocks and disturbances of both character and sexual function. In Functional-Sexological therapy, one focus of treatment is amelioration of voluntary movement.

'The present study examines the association of general everyday body movement with history of vaginal orgasm.’

The team said the objective was to determine if appropriately trained sexologists could infer women's history of vaginal orgasm from observing only their gait.

The walk of a woman who has had orgasms, but not from intercourse with a man is visibly different

‘Clitoral orgasm history was unrelated to both ratings and to vaginal orgasm history. Exploratory analyses suggest that greater pelvic and vertebral rotation and stride length might be characteristic of the gait of women who have experienced vaginal orgasm.

‘The discerning observer may infer women's experience of vaginal orgasm from a gait that comprises fluidity, energy, sensuality, freedom, and absence of both flaccid and locked muscles.

'Results are discussed with regard to previous research on gait, the effect of the musculature on sexual function, the special nature of vaginal orgasm, and implications for sexual therapy.’
