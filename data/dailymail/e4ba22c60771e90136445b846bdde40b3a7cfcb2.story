'Inspirational': Joshua Cawley, 22, died from the injuries he suffered as a baby 21 years earlier, an inquest heard

An 'inspirational' son died in the arms of his adoptive family from injuries he suffered 21 years earlier when he was 'thrown into his cot' as a baby, an inquest heard.

Joshua Cawley, 22, was born a healthy baby boy but developed quadriplegic cerebral palsy, vision problems and epilepsy after a vicious head injury when he was aged just 10 months.

At an emotional inquest in Bolton, Greater Manchester, his adoptive parents blamed Joshua's 'ticking timebomb' condition on the alleged abuse he suffered as a baby.

The parents told the hearing that no one should live such as short life and die in such a tragic way.

The inquest heard that Joshua's birth family were charged in 1990 with causing his head injury by throwing him into his cot but a judge in London kicked out the case due to 'evidential differences'.

His adoptive parents Lynn Cawley and Ruth Wood said Joshua's death had left a 'big hole' in their lives, adding: 'We consider ourselves privileged to have been allowed to care for Joshua.Â 

'However, we are mindful that Joshua only came to us as a result of the shocking abuse he suffered as a child.

'While the inquest process has been painful for us, we are grateful that this verdict marks a recognition that Joshua should not have lived and died in the way he did.'

Joshua, who was born Dean Gill in London, was rushed to Great Ormond Street Hospital in May, 1990 with a severe head injury.

'Ticking timebomb': Joshua developed quadriplegic cerebral palsy from the head injury when he 10 months old

His mother and step-father were charged with actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm and child cruelty for both Joshua and his older brother and stood trial in January, 1991 at Inner London Crown Court.

It was alleged they had thrown Joshua into his cot and caused the head injury. It was also claimed his mother had hit his brother.

But due to 'evidential differences' the judge directed the jury to find the pair not guilty.

Joshua was in hospital for six 
months. His severe head injury caused quadriplegic cerebral palsy, 
vision problems and epilepsy but as he got older his condition worsened.

'Abuse': Joshua suffered the devastating head injury when he was allegedly thrown in his cot as a baby

He
suffered from severe muscle spasms, which often fractured and broke his
bones, and Joshua had numerous operations and procedures throughout his
life.

When he was aged two, Joshua was fostered by Ms Cawley and she and partner Ms Wood adopted him when he was five, and provided him with 24-hour care.

Tragic: Joshua's adoptive parents say his death has left a 'big hole' in their lives

Joshua attended Newfields School, in Darwen, Lancs, and the Nugent Centre, in Farnworth, Bolton. He had two adopted siblings and two birth siblings, who were adopted into a different family.

Forensic pathologist Dr Daniel du Plessis, who specialises in child abuse cases, told his inquest the injuries that Joshua had sustained when he was a baby were 'strongly associated with child abuse' and injuries to his gum were often caused by forcing a dummy or bottle into a baby's mouth.

He added the injuries 'involved shaking with an impact and that caused Joshua to stop breathing and that caused the brain damage that led to his disabled state and eventually the fatal pneumonia'.

Dr du Plessis added that in his opinion it was 'non-accidental'.

Joshua tragically passed away at his adopted home last June from a respiratory infection developed as a result of his severe disabilities - which Bolton's deputy coroner Alan Walsh said were caused by a 'non-accidental injury'.

Mr Walsh, recording a narrative verdict, praised Joshua's adoptive parents and said their care had been 'magnificent' and said he could not speak highly enough for the care he received from various agencies in Bolton.

He said Joshua was 'brave, courageous young man'.

At Joshua's funeral at Bolton's St Andrew's Methodist Church - where he was described as 'a beloved son, brother, nephew and cousin, he was a friend and inspiration to so many' - friends were asked to celebrate 'his wonderful life' by wearing bright colours 'to reflect Joshua's wonderful personality.'

Donations in Joshua's memory were used to buy much needed medical equipment in Haiti.
