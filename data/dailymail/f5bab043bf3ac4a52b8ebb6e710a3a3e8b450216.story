Jodi Arias planned to have the prosecutor who has left her facing the death penalty killed and was disappointed that he didn't 'love her', a former cellmate has claimed.

Cassandra Collins said that Arias boasted that she would get prosecutor Juan Martinez murdered by slitting his throat in a mafia-style hit.

'She's very dangerous.. very dangerous,' Collins told Fox affiliate KSAZ. The women shared a cell before Arias' high-profile trial earlier this year.

A date has yet to be set for the second penalty stage of Arias' hearing, which will determine if she gets the death penalty for murdering Travis Alexander, her ex-boyfriend, in June 2008.

But Collins claims that Arias told her that if she gets capital punishment, she planned to get her own back against prosecutor Martinez.

'She said that if she was given the death sentence... she wanted to get her revenge... she knows inmates on the outs to do a mafia bow tie... yeah. Cut his throat,' Collins told KSAZ.

The former cellmate also believes that Arias was really threatening Martinez's life. 'I really think she would try to hurt someone,' Collins added.

Collins also said that Arias appeared to have some sort of fascination with the prosecutor and would ask why Martinez didn't 'love her.'

Her prison companion said she would reply: 'He's your prosecutor.. he's there to prosecute you for a crime.. and I'm like why doesn't he love you?... She's out of her freakin' mind.'

Collins said she thinks Martinez needs to look out for his own safety. KZAZ reported that the attorney's office and Arias' defense team will be looking into the claims.

On Tuesday Arias' attorneys said they want a judge to compel jurors in her penalty phase retrial to reveal their Twitter user names so the accounts can be monitored to ensure they aren't communicating about the case.

Arias was convicted of murder in May in the 2008 death of boyfriend Travis Alexander in his suburban Phoenix home.

The same jury failed to agree on her sentence, setting the stage for a second penalty phase.

During a hearing Tuesday, defense attorney Kirk Nurmi argued that Arias needs juror Twitter accounts to ensure they are not being influenced by outside elements.

Prosecutor Martinez calls it an invasion of juror privacy. The judge hasn't ruled.

Judge Sherry Stephens is banning live television coverage of Arias' sentencing phase retrial as prosecutors again seek the death penalty.
