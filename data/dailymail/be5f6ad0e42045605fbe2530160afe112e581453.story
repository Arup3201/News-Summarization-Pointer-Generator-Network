It might not be everyone's idea of a perfect home - but at least there will never be a queue for the lavatory.

This toilet in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, has just sold at auction for £100,000.

The brickbuilt structure was used as a public convenience up until 2012 when it was closed as part of a cost-cutting review by Derbyshire Dales District Council.

The Derbyshire toilet block fetched £100,000 at auction - ten times more than its guide price

Although the building still contains toilets, it is unclear what the new owner will use it for

The single-storey building, which comes complete with roof lighting and running water, has two rooms - a gents' and a ladies'.

Each has a row of wash basins and cubicles, with the gents having the added bonus of 10 urinals.

Other perks include toilet roll dispensers and hand dryers.

Auctioneer Simon Riggall said the unusual triangular shaped property sold for ten times its £10,000 guide price.

He said: 'With a building like this, the beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

Two rival buyers embarked on a bidding war which saw the sale price of the block rocket

The auctioneer said there had been plenty of interest in the single-storey triangular building

The council said the money from the sale would be put towards a capital fund

'We
 have to distance ourselves from it and allow the public to have their 
ideas and visions and decide for themselves what it is going to be.

'In the end, it came down to two bidders who kept going right up to £100,000.'

Retired auctioneer Barry Pearson lives close to the toilet block and was shocked to hear how much it reached.

He
 said: 'I thought about £25,000 to £30,000 would have been perfectly 
reasonable but I’m absolutely staggered at the figure it’s made.

'I’ve seen amazing prices over the years but this has to be one of the most extraordinary I’ve ever seen.'
