As the U.S. and Russia jostled for supremacy during the cold war, both sides spent a great deal of time and money investigating how animals could be used as spies.

Many of the ideas sound bizarre, but at the IQ Zoo in Hot Springs, Arkansas, experts had a government contract to train animals specifically for defense and intelligence work.

Not all of their attempts were successful, some never got past the drawing board, but others were used during the cold war era for spying purposes included training ravens to deposit and 
retrieve objects, conditioning pigeons to warn of enemy ambushes and 
even teaching cats to eavesdrop on human conversations.

Bob Bailey and his team at the IQ Zoo in Arkansas had government funding in the 60s and 70s to develop animals such as ravens for spying purposes

‘We never found an animal we could not train,’ Bob Bailey, who worked on the program, told Smithsonian.

Now 76, he was the first Director of Training in the Navy's Marine Mammal Program, before he joined IQ Zoo and  becoming general manager of Animal Behavior Enterprises (ABE), the company who owned the zoo.

Although animals had been used for military intelligence purposes since ancient Greek times, it was during the 1960s that the work came especially into vogue.

As well as a tourist destination where parents could take their children to watch chickens play baseball and macaws ride bicycles, the IQ Zoo started to receive funding from governments agencies - including the CIA - to use animals for other purposes.

IQ Zoo was founded by Marian and Keller Breland, who were advocates of operant conditioning to train animals such as this 'muscular goat' which could trip a sledgehammer to ring a bell

‘They came to us to solve problems,’ said Bailey. ‘It was the height of the cold war.’

The zoo was opened by Keller Breland and his wife Marian, who had been students of the psychologist B.F. Skinner, who had devised the concept of operant conditioning and teaching animals to carry out complex processes.

During World War II, Skinner had received defense funding to research a pigeon-based homing device for missiles, although it was never deployed.

Prior to joining IQ Zoo, Bailey had been the first director of training for the Navy’s pioneering dolphin program, which developed methods of training them to perform tasks including detecting and clearing mines to retrieving tools.

A partially declassified 1976 CIA document on naval dolphin training notes, the Soviets were ‘also assessing and replicating U.S. systems while possibly developing countermeasures to certain U.S. systems.’

Soon after joining ABE, Bailey got involved in the ‘acoustic kitty’ project, after the CIA’s Directorate of Science and Technology had proposed using cats as listening devices. 

Both the Russians and Americans tried to dolphins to perform tasks including detecting and clearing mines and retrieving tools

According to Bailey, the theory was that no one would pay attention to the animals’ comings and goings.

‘We found that we could condition the cat to listen to voices,’ said Bailey.

‘We have no idea how we did it. But...we found that the cat would more and more listen to people’s voices, and listen less to other things.’

Using cochlear implants, his team attempted to use cats as transmitters with a wire running from the cat’s inner ear to a battery and instrument cluster implanted in its rib cage. 

The cat’s movements could be directed - left, right, straight ahead - with ultrasonic sound.

The fate of the ‘acoustic kitty’ isn't clear as there were conflicting accounts about the project. 

Ex-CIA official Victor Marchetti claimed in the book ‘The Wizards of Langley’ that the cat was run over by a taxi before his skills could be utilized.

Keller Breland, training a dolphin for the Navy, started IQ Zoo with his wife after working with acclaimed psychologist B.F. Skinner

Ravens were another creature that Bailey and the team found could be used for spying purposes.

He recalled building a ‘movie set’ of the area around the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C. and then conditioning a raven, via a laser spotter, to pick out a particular room.

Bailey claims that both ravens and cats were successfully used to spy, but the program suffered a cut in funding following in 1975 after the Senate Select Committee to Study Government Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities was formed to investigate abuses of power at several U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA.

In more recent years, the work carried out by Bailey and team at IQ Zoo has been overtaken by technology.

'Today, all you have to do is illuminate someone with an infrared laser and pick up the scatter back from that, and you can listen to their conversation without any trouble at all,' he said.

'You don’t need a cat.'

Cats were also taught how to eavesdrop on humans

Funding for the research ended in the mid-70s and spying nowadays uses advanced technology
