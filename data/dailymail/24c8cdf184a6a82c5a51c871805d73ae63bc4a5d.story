Jailed: Arnie Rogers, 23, described his driving as 'careless mischief' when he was arrested by police following the fatal crash in Swindon in May

A driver who killed another motorist in a hit-and-run accident said 'that's £9,000 down the drain' after being told his car had been written off in the fatal crash, a court heard.

Arnie Rogers, 23, was driving at more than 70mph in a 40mph zone when he 'obliterated' a car being driven by 61-year-old Peter Winters.

Mr Winters' 33-year-old son, Paul, died after being thrown out of the passenger seat while Mr Winters, who was trapped in the wreckage, suffered multiple injuries and  fell into a coma.

Rogers abandoned his Vauxhall Astra and fled the scene in Swindon, Wiltshire, after the accident in May. He was arrested less than three hours later while sleeping on a friend's sofa.

When officers told him that his car had been wrecked he said: 'That's £9,000 down the drain then.'

He was jailed for six years and eight months at Swindon Crown Court on Friday after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving. 

Judge Peter Blair QC described the quip as 'despicable'.

He told Rogers: 'Your recklessness gave Paul Winters a death sentence and his father Peter terrible injuries.

'Your driving in the moments before the collision was frighteningly dangerous. You offered no attempt to help your victims or stay at the scene to warn other drivers.

'I cannot fail to mention the despicable comments you made when you didn't even ask about the welfare of your victims.'

The father and son were driving to a car boot sale in their Nissan shortly after 6.20am when they were hit by Rogers, who had left a nightclub in the centre of Swindon at 3am.

Other road users saw Rogers driving erratically through the town, tailgating and overtaking at high speed.

Hannah Squire, prosecuting, told the court: 'One road user describes the car as carrying out chicane movements in and out of the traffic, and the driver as irresponsible, dangerous, and stupid.'

Mr Winters was turning into a retail park when Rogers' Vauxhall jumped a red light and smashed into his car. The collision report showed the Astra was travelling between 76 and 87mph at the time of impact and the Winters' Nissan was driving at 12mph.

Witnesses said they saw two men, Rogers and his passenger, run away from the accident. 

Miss Squire said: 'When Peter woke [from his coma] he was told of the death of his son. Peter remembers nothing of the accident and was in intensive care for two and a half weeks.

'He suffered serious internal injuries with fractured ribs and a broken collar bone.'

Rogers was arrested at 9am at a flat in Swindon as he slept on the sofa in blood-stained clothes, the court heard.

Miss Squire said: 'Once he got to the police station he asked how his car was looking,' said Miss Squire.

'When told it was a wreck he said, "Well that's £9,000 down the drain". He described his driving as 'careless mischief'.

'There is a lack of remorse shown at the scene or any responsibility for his actions.'

In his victim impact statement, Peter Winters, who is still recovering from his injuries, said: 'At my age I may never recover fully.

'The most devastating impact is the loss of my son, Paul, and not a minute goes by when I do not think of him. It is not possible to put into words how devastating this has been for my family.'

Rob Ross, defending Rogers, said his client was regarded as a hard worker and normal lad.

'It is apparent to me that he feels genuinely aghast at what he caused,' he told the court.

'He accepts he drove like an idiot. Whatever comes out of this will show other young men that motor vehicles are dangerous.'

The court was told that Rogers, of Swindon, has previous convictions from September 2010 for drink driving, driving without insurance and failing to stop after an accident for which he was banned for driving for 19 months. He was handed a further ten-year driving ban at the hearing on Friday.
