Everton were beaten by newly promoted Leicester 1-0 in a pre-season friendly game played in humid conditions at the Suphachalasai Stadium in Bangkok.

Gary Taylor-Fletcher scored the only goal of the game, netting in the 54th minute after the Foxes had seen two previous goals ruled out.

Nigel Pearson named £7million club record signing Leonardo Ulloa in a strong Leicester team which also included Kasper Schmeichel, Wes Morgan and David Nugent.

Leon Osman captained a young Everton 
side which started without an out and out striker as they wore their new
 black away strip for the first time.

And the Toffees' skipper had their best chance of the first half forcing a good stop from Schmeichel who also kept out a Luke Garbutt free-kick.

Nugent had the ball in the back of the net for Leicester on 36 minutes with a first time volley but the goal was ruled out for offside.

Leicester
 made 10 changes at the break with only Morgan being kept on for the 
second half and it proved a success as they broke the deadlock within 10
 minutes of the restart.

Everton midfielder Darron Gibson continued his return from a long-term knee injury with his second appearance of pre-season.

Martinez made six changes in total at half-time switching from a back four to a back three with John Stones one of those introduced.

Taylor-Fletcher
 gave Leicester the lead in the 54th minute when he converted Jamie 
Vardy's cross from five yards after Vardy had beaten Everton goalkeeper 
Joel Robles to the ball.

Riyad Mahrez came close to doubling Leicester's lead late on but the Algerian shot wide.

The
 newly promoted Premier League side held on and saw out the win which 
will give reason for hope ahead of the upcoming campaign.

‘It was a difficult match for both teams,' said Martinez. 'We tried the best we could in very humid condititions. It was the type of game where you had to get through much physical pain and I’m happy with the work we put in.’

The two sides meet again on the opening day of the season at the King Power Stadium.
