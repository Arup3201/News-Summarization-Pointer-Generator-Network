Arsenal want to sign Real Madrid and Spain keeper Iker Casillas before the end of the World Cup.

Arsene Wenger is on the lookout for a new keeper to provide competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the departure of Lukasz Fabianski to Swansea.

And Madrid-based paper AS claim that Wenger's number one target is Casillas, who was frequently rotated with Diego Lopez by Real boss Carlo Ancelotti last season.

The 33-year-old has three years left on his contract at the Bernabeu but his wages decrease year on year and that may force him to asses his options.

Wenger is hopeful Casillas' compatriot Santi 
Cazorla and former team-mate Mesut Ozil can convince him to make the 
switch to the Emirates. 

Arsenal have also been linked with a move for Cardiff keeper David Marshall and have had a £6million bid rejected. AS, meanwhile, claim that Wenger will move for Malaga's Willy Caballero or Saint-Étienne's Stephane Ruffier if he can't sign Casillas.
