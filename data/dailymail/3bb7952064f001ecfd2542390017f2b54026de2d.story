Falling out: James Pepe allegedly tried to hire a hitman to kill a former colleague he believed was spreading vicious rumours about him

A teacher tried to hire a hitman to kill
a former co-worker after he suspected him of spreading a rumour that he
was a child molester, police have said.

James J Pepe, of Brandon, Florida, allegedly tried to hire a contract killer to kill Robert Meredith, of Plant City, who he blamed for his troubles at work.

But the police were made aware of Pepe's plan, and brought in the FBI who set up a sting operation where the 55-year-old allegedly told an officer he was willing to pay $2,000 to have Meredith killed.

Police say the two teachers fell out while working at Strawberry Crest High School, in Dover.

The rift saw Pepe transfer to another school, according to reports, while economics teacher Mr Meredith, 49 remained at Strawberry Crest.

Mr Meredith has said the news had come as a 'complete shock' to him as the pair had never socialised or fallen out.

But Officer Tray Towles, a Plant City Police Department spokesman, told the Tampa Bay Times that police understood Pepe felt Meredith was behind anything negative which happened to him at work.

He said the breaking point came when 55-year-old Pepe suspected his colleague was spreading rumours about him.

Officer Towles said: 'Meredith was allegedly telling everybody (Pepe) was a child molester.'

Police have said officers worked with the FBI to set 
up a sting operation following a tip-off, where a Plant City 
undercover officer played the role of a hitman.

They allege during a call on 
September 13 Pepe told the undercover officer he 'had an issue he might 
need take care of' and was willing to pay $2,000.

They have said during a second call the officer attempted to arrange a meeting, which Pepe refused, but still allegedly said he wanted Meredith killed.

Arrest: Pepe was arrested at the school at the of class by police and now faces a charge of solicitation of first-degree murder

Officers arrested the history teacher - known by students as Dr Pepe - at the end of school on Thursday outside the school.

He faces a charge of soliciation of first-degree murder and was being held without bail at the Hillsborough County jail.

Meredith meanwhile has said he knew of Pepe but never socialised with him.

He told ABC Action News he never exchanged words with Pepe or engaged in a scuffle.

He said: 'This came as a complete shock.'

Pepe started working for the Hillsborough County School District 28 years ago.

Former student Dee Dee Cardenas, 22, of Dover, who was in Pepe's government class at Durant High in 2007, said she was stunned to hear her former teacher was behind bars.

She said: 'I just remember him being really good teacher. It is a little disturbing to hear this.'Â
