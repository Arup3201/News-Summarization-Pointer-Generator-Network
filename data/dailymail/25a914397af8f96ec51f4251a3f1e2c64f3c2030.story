Three forgers were today jailed for a total of 12 years following what police believe was the largest ever plot to make fake pound coins in the UK - some of which may still be in circulation.

Kevin Fisher, 53, of Goffs Oak, Hertfordshire, Daniel Sullivan, 28, of Hornchurch, east London, and Mark Abbott, 44, of Edmonton, north London, were all sentenced at Southwark Crown Court today.

The three men were behind what is thought to be a record number of fake coins worth £1.5million, which were discovered after an undercover Metropolitan Police operation in May last year.

A 40ft storage container that contained 1,600,000 metal discs was found in Waltham Abbey, Essex, with £20,000 of fake coins. There was also £30,000 in fake coins in a car nearby.

Scotland Yard said the haul was ‘the tip of the iceberg’ for the gang, and that the coins were of high enough quality to pass off as real. It said some of the fake currency might now be in circulation.

Bucketfuls of bogus 'good to go' coins worth £85,000 were seized at another site in Waltham Abbey.

Some 30,000 coins were also discovered buried in the flooring of Abbott's Chrysler people-carrier, stashed in 30 boxes each containing £1,000, the court heard.

Grandfather: Mark Abbott, 44, was 'in financial hardship and promised money for his participation'

The gang used pay-as-you-go phones and coded messages to try to slip under the radar.

Ringleader Fisher was jailed for seven years, co-conspirator Sullivan for three, and trader Abbott for two.

Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said: 'This was a scheme to manufacture and pass counterfeit coins on a very large scale indeed.

'I have no way of knowing how much counterfeit currency had been passed into the economy but the minimum number of coins and discs seized in this case was over 1.5million.

'This was a sophisticated and carefully run operation with pay-as-you-go phones and coded text messages to prevent detection. The reliability of the money in our pockets is essential in everyday life.'

Shaven-headed and wearing a grey fleece jacket, Abbott put his head in his hands and appeared to be on the verge of tears as the sentence was passed.

Fisher, wearing a beige sweater, light blue shirt and glasses, and Sullivan, sporting a black long-sleeved top, remained stony-faced as they were led out of the dock.

Alexander Cameron, defending Fisher, insisted he was not the person who produced the blank discs or hired the containers, adding that someone else was ‘making money out of it’.

Jason Dunn-Shaw, defending Abbott, said the father of three and grandfather of one was part of a 'close family’, adding: 'He was in financial hardship and was promised money for his participation.’

Fisher was found guilty of conspiring to pass counterfeit coins, and having custody of items to make counterfeit coins.

Sullivan was found guilty of conspiring to pass counterfeit coins, but cleared of having items to make them.

Abbott pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiracy to pass or give to another to pass a counterfeit of a protected coin.

Metropolitan Police Detective Inspector Bruce South said outside court: ‘These three men are organised criminals who were intent on undermining the UK monetary system.

‘There is nothing fake about the reality they must now face of life behind bars. We remain steadfast in our determination disrupt and tackle organised criminal networks’.
