The best man won. This has been Cristiano Ronaldo's year, a 12-month carnival of extraordinary forward play. It has been so good, even the man who doesn't like him had to admit it.

'Yes, it was justified,' Lionel Messi noted through gritted teeth. 'It was deserved.'

Much is made of the tensions that exist between Ronaldo and Messi but this is not a rivalry to promote something. This antipathy is genuine and was evident from the moment they walked into a cavernous room in Zurich's Kongresshaus for a pre-ceremony conference.

In marched Ronaldo first, peacock proud, chest puffed out; a glistening diamond in each ear, not a hair out of place, a man who – with 31 goals in 30 La Liga games in 2014 – looked every inch the superstar.

Messi shuffled in next, ahead of Manuel Neuer, in a grey hoodie and jeans, appearing as if he had just walked out of the classroom. There had been anxieties within FIFA that Messi might not turn up for their big night and the Argentine hardly gave the impression of wanting to be in Switzerland.

He scored a staggering 56 goals in 2014 but, unlike his rival, he will not look back with any kind of affection; a failure to reach the last four of the Champions League, a lost World Cup final and recent simmering tensions at the Nou Camp have knocked Messi from his pedestal.

Did he try and steal some of the spotlight back here? Perhaps. Turning up for the actual ceremony in a garish purple tuxedo, Messi set tongues wagging with a cryptic answer to an innocuous question from the floor, hinting that the unthinkable – leaving Barcelona – might be possible.

'I'm not sure if I will go back to Newells Old Boys one day,' said Messi. 'I'm not sure where I will be next year. I have always said I will end my career at Barcelona but as Cristiano said, only God knows the future. Things can change in football overnight.'

Cue a raising of eyebrows. If Messi is sulking about Barcelona's current state, he didn't try to hide his emotions. When a video with a message from current coach Luis Enrique was shown, wishing him well for the award, Messi's face never cracked. Enrique's words during the broadcast were equally cold.

Asked later to define his relationship with Enrique, Messi bluntly replied: 'A manager-player relationship, just like any other.'

He was only third behind Ronaldinho and Frank Lampard in the 2005 Ballon d’Or but Steven Gerrard won a special prize via social media on Monday night. 

Twitter users mocked last season’s infamous slip in the crucial defeat against Chelsea by awarding the Liverpool captain the ‘2014 Fallon D’Floor’.

Clearly all is not well. Messi is not doing anything to quell the storm that is brewing around him and it did not go unnoticed that he voted for Jose Mourinho in his top three coaches of the year. Coming a week after he started following Chelsea on Instagram, the conspiracy theories will run.

This night, however, was about more than Messi. It was a coronation of genius, which is what Ronaldo is; it should not be taken for granted what he has achieved or what he has become since he first came to our attention as a spindly yearling in the summer of 2003.

Ronaldo has matured into the most magnificent specimen. Tall, powerful, with the neck of a boxer and the speed of a sprinter, his third Ballon d'Or puts him up with Gods such as Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten. Joining Messi on four will be a certainty if he holds his form.

'This is one of the happiest nights of my life,' he said shortly after coming off stage. 'Fantastic. It was a dream come true for me. I never thought I would win three Gold Balls. Fantastic. I want to win as many as possible. It's hard, it's very difficult to win. But everything is possible.

'A fourth? It depends on what I am going to do during the season but this is going to give me motivation to work hard and get myself more and more and we will see if I am here next year. It's more difficult to win it the third time than the first time.'

During that early afternoon Q-and-A, Messi, the outstanding Neuer – a keeper who 'dominates absolutely everything', according to Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola – and Ronaldo had been asked which players from the past they would have most like to work with.

None, out of fear of being received to be disrespectful, felt it appropriate to pick out an individual, so Ronaldo played to the gallery and said it would be nice 'if us three guys' could be on the same team. Messi then cracked and said Ronaldo had been excellent.

The internet can be a cruel place as social network users were quick to mock Steven Gerrard

So how did it feel to hear that from his greatest rival?

'Listening to Leo felt good,' said Ronaldo. 'Listening to my team-mates and rivals say good things feels great. Especially Leo. I think the same about him. Maybe he has helped me become a better player. People mention that and it's possible. It's good.

'I hope he does that for many years to motivate me to win more things for the club and individual things too. This gives me motivation to be a better player all the time. I'm really happy, it's a fantastic moment in my career.

'I want to carry on with more titles, collective and individual, and see if we are here again next year.'

If they are, it will be the ninth consecutive year they have shared this particular stage. Some may argue there is no fun in a two-horse race but this, beyond question, is a rivalry to be savoured. There may never be another like it.
