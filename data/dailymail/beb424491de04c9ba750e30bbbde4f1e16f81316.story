A bank teller in Northern Kentucky who said she has held her job for 24 years claims to have been fired for telling a customer: 'Have a blessed day.'

However the U.S. Bank in Walton say that Polly Neace had numerous strikes against her name, including lecturing one person about salvation.

'I say 'have a blessed day' all of the time,' Neace told Fox 19.

'I don't think there's any better kind of day you can have than a blessed day.'

Neace filed a lawsuit against U.S. Bank on the grounds that her termination was based on her religious beliefs.

"I say 'have a blessed day' all of the time," says Polly Neace. "I don't think there's any better kind of day you can have than a blessed day."

Neace filed a lawsuit against U.S. Bank claiming she was discriminated against for her religious beliefs.

Neace clams after years of saying "Have a blessed day" to customers, she was reprimanded in March 2011

She said it all started in March 2011 when someone complained she had told them 'have a blessed day'.

In a Code of Ethics violation, US Bank states several customers had complained when Neace said the phrase, which has Christian connotations.

The written warning also states that Neace asked a customer 'Did you take the Lord's name in vain?' and then proceeded to talk to that customer about salvation.

That Code of Ethics Violation warns Neace that 'effective immediately you will no longer discuss the subject of faith or religion with customers and co-workers alike'.

'I was upset with the fact they were stifling me and not allowing me to act on my beliefs,' Neace told Fox 19.

Neace admits she was reprimanded again a few months later.

'A customer went through the drive thru and I waited on them. She said, ''God bless you'',' Neace said.

'I said, ''Thank you, God bless you too''.'

Polly Neace is a devout Christian who attends church each Sunday

U.S. Bank says they are confident they can fight the claims of Polly Neace

Neace said the final straw then came when she jokingly told a manager something along the lines of: 'Maybe I should just go back to saying ''Have a blessed day''.'

She was then fired.

'I can't back down from this. It's the principle behind everything,' Neace said.

However U.S. Bank says they are also willing to fight.

'At U.S. Bank, we hold our employees to high ethical standards when interacting with customers and co-workers, and take violations of these standards seriously,' the bank said in a statement.

'While we cannot comment provide comment on pending litigation, we believe that this lawsuit is without merit and believe the facts presented in future legal proceedings will justify our actions.'
