Germany boss Joachim Low told Mario Gotze to prove he is better than Lionel Messi minutes before the Bayern Munich attacker scored the winning goal in the World Cup final.

And Low insists Gotze’s stunning strike seven minutes from the end showed exactly that.

He said: 'I told Gotze at the break in half time at extra time: ‘show you are better than Messi, show you are a better player than him and can win a World Cup”.

'He did that.

Germany,
 who destroyed hosts Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final, had maintained the 
start of the tournament that their target was to win the World Cup and 
that is exactly what they did.

The 54-year-old explained how the triumph in Rio de Janeiro was the culmination of a decade's work.

‘We have been together for 55 days, we have started this project ten years ago and this is the result of many years of work,' he explained.

'This was started by Jurgen Klinsmann, we improved our performances and made constant progress. Champions do it, we believed in it and we worked in it.

‘We showed the best performance of all the teams over seven matches. We have to look back on ten years’ preparation. We have developed an unbelievable team spirit.

‘We have the willpower to carry it out, as well as technical ability.

‘We are the first European team to win in south American and this makes us proud.'

Captain Philipp Lahm said: ‘Whether we have the best individual players or whatever does not matter, you have to have the best team. 

‘We stepped up time and again in the tournament, we did not let ourselves get distracted by any disruption, went on our way. 

‘And at the end you stand there as world champions - an unbelievable feeling. The team has remained quiet and patient.’

Lahm later returned to the pitch at the Maracana after leaving dressing room celebrations to be with the travelling German fans still singing in the stadium.

Schurrle, who scored three times for Germany at the tournament, said: ‘This is the best moment of my life. I had to cry because I was so overcome. 

‘I couldn't stop it. It was always a dream to become a world champion. We are so looking forward to celebrating with our fans in Berlin.’

Mats Hummels, one of the stars of the tournament, claimed Germany acted as a team throughout.

The central defender said: ‘I am still completely trapped in another world, physically too exhausted to be able to rejoice euphorically. But that will come in the coming days.

‘You can only be world champions when you act as a team. We wanted to make that clear to everyone the whole time and we achieved that, even if we got that little bit of luck in the final as we were already a bit waiting for penalties.'
