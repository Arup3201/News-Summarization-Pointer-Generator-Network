Two were arrested on Dick Cheney's lawn as dozens gathered outside the former vice president's home to protest torture on Saturday.

The crowd of 20 demonstrators was there to mark the 13th anniversary of the opening of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and protest the torture of detainees held by the United States.

The protesters, some clad in orange jumpsuits reminiscent of those worn by inmates at Guantanamo, along with black hoods, walked across the snow-covered lawn of Cheney's home in McLean, Virginia.

Code Pink, the group organizing the demonstration, also had members in front of the home of CIA Director John Brennan, calling it their 'Guantanamo Anniversary Weekend Torturers Tour.' 

A 6,000-page report from the US Senate released last month detailed how the CIA misled the White House and public about the detention and torture of prisoners held as part of the War on Terror.

The report included instances of 'rectal feeding' and 'rectal rehydration,' and said in some cases detainees were kept awake for up to a week. 

On Fox News, Cheney called the report 'full of crap' and 'deeply flawed,' though he admitted he had only 'seen parts' and 'read summaries.'

He also defended the techniques used on detainees as 'successful.'

'The question is what are you prepared to do in order to get the truth about future attacks against the United States,' he said to Fox News host Bret Baier.

This is in spite of findings in the report that showed torture techniques to be ineffective at creating actionable intelligence, and instead leading detainees to stop talking or fabricate information.

Deeply flawed: Former vice president Cheney called the Senate report on torture 'full of crap' and claimed that torture was successful in stopped attacks on the US, though no evidence has yet been presented

The Guardian reports that Senator Dianne Feinstein claimed investigators could not find one instance where torture produced intelligence used to prevent future attacks that had not already been obtained through other means.

The Senate report also found that at least 26 of the 119 prisoners believed to have been detained at Guantanamo were 'wrongfully held.'

Fairfax County police spokesman Roger Henriquez said that police arrested two protesters who refused to leave the property after being asked to leave.

Code Pink identified the two as Tighe Barry, 57, and Eve Tetaz, 83, and told Reuters they were unfairly singled out.
