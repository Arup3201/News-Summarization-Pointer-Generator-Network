Earlier in the day, they had greeted huge crowds outside Buckingham Palace as the country rejoiced at victory in the Second World War.

And this is how – according to filmmakers, at least – the young Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret subsequently mingled with the masses as the raucous VE Day celebrations continued into the night.

Girls’ Night Out is a fictionalised version of the evening of May 8, 1945, when the future queen and her sister slipped out of the  Palace and joined in with the party spirit.

Elizabeth detailed the occasion in her teenage  diaries, recalling the event was ‘great fun’ as she mixed with revellers in the streets.

Elizabeth's friend and cousin, the Honourable Margaret Rhodes, claimed many years later in her memoir the group slipped out of the palace to join the nation's carousing.

The new film will put what it will claim is flesh on the bones of that extraordinary assertion. However, that flesh is likely to prove highly controversial as it will suggest Princess Margaret danced exuberantly in a Trafalgar Square fountain and the sisters then went on to a club in Liverpool.

Trafalgar Square has been transformed for the filming of VE Day production Girl's Night Out (pictured). Hundreds of actors took to the London landmark today to film scenes for the movie - which is a re-imagining of events on May 8 1945

Revelers smile at the camera as they celebrate the end of the Second World War in Europe. It is thought more than one million people in the UK celebrated on that night - many of whom flocked to Trafalgar Square

Princess Margaret, played by Bel Powley, lifts up her skirt to make her way round the fountain in the re-imagined VE Day celebrations. The script has not been verified by the Palace - although the book on which is it based is thought to have been approved by the Queen

The fictional Princess Margaret dances in rather raucous celebration - a scene that is certainly not documented in Mrs Rhodes' extraordinary memoir

The
 Final Curtsey by Margaret Rhodes was written with the 
full knowledge of the Queen - who is said to have read and approved 
sections of the text.

However, there has been no official corroboration of its account of the VE Day celebrations.

The book recounts how, on the night of May 8, the Queen 
enjoyed ‘a unique burst of personal freedom; a Cinderella moment in 
reverse’.

Mrs Rhodes 
writes: ‘I can’t remember exactly what we got up to, and so the Queen 
has provided me with an aide-memoire taken from her diary entries for 
that time.’

The memoir 
states young Princess Margaret's diary entry for the following day 
reads: 'PM announced unconditional surrender. Sixteen of us went out in 
crowd, cheered parents on balcony. Up St J’s St [St James’s Street], 
Piccadilly, great fun.

'Out
 in crowd again – Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly, Pall Mall, walked simply
 miles. Saw parents on balcony at 12.30am – ate, partied, bed 3am!’

It
 also says the future Queen wrote in her diary: 'Out in crowd, 
Whitehall, Mall, St J St, Piccadilly, Park Lane, Constitution Hill, ran 
through Ritz. Walked miles, drank in Dorchester, saw parents twice, 
miles away, so many people.

Later she wrote: 'Out in crowd 
again. Embankment, 
Piccadilly. Rained, so fewer people. Congered into house [a reference to
 the conga and Buckingham Palace] . . . Sang till 2am. Bed at 3am!’

Actress Sarah Gadon, who plays the young Princess Elizabeth in the film, can be seen enjoying the crowds in a fabulous pink embellished dress

The cast of Girls' Night Out celebrate the fall of Nazi Germany by climbing on to a lion statue in Trafalgar Square. The filming took place exactly 69 years after the original public holiday

The party continues among the crew of the film, which has an all-star cast and has been filmed in numerous locations across the country

Later in the memoir, Mrs Rhodes, writes: 'A
 gang of us, including the two Princesses, were given permission by the 
King and Queen to slip away anonymously and join the rejoicing crowds on
 the streets.

'There must
 have been about 16 of us and we had as escort the King’s Equerry, a 
very correct Royal Navy captain in a pinstriped suit, bowler hat and 
umbrella.

'Princess 
Elizabeth was in uniform, as a subaltern in the Auxiliary Transport 
Service – the ATS. She pulled her peaked cap well down over her face to 
disguise her much-photographed image. Miraculously she got away with it.'

Uniformed cast members vigorously wave a selection of British and American flags in one scene

Revelers wade in to the water at the central London landmark  - hitching up their skirts and shorts. The film has already caused controversy as it depicts a young Elizabeth kissing an RAF gunner

The celebrations continue for the cast members - many of whom are wearing hats and waving small Union Jacks. The film is a re-imaging of events, based on a memoir

A fun-loving cast member wrapped in a Union Jack flag with a party hat on her head smiles as she walks through the streets

The new film, Girls Night Out, however, varies from this account somewhat.

In
 some scenes, the young royals are seen chatting with handsome young men -
 before Princess Margaret jumps into the Trafalgar Square fountain.

Young
 Elizabeth can be seen getting very close to a man in uniform - and is 
later shown kissing a dashing young RAF Lancaster gunner.

The film stars Rupert Everett 
as King George VI, Emily Watson as Queen Elizabeth as well as Sarah Gadon as 
Princess Elizabeth and Bel Powley as Margaret.

According
 to the film an adventurous Margaret, then just 15, slips away from her guards and hops on a bus.

Princess
 Elizabeth then races around the city in a bid to find her younger sister - finding the gunner, who has no idea who she is, along the way

As she attempts 
to find Margaret, she and her companion visit a couple of sleazy Soho nightclubs - and eventually the princess's identity is revealed.

Two female characters seem to be having a whale of a time drinking beer and waving their flags while wandering through the crowds on set

Men from the armed forces wave flags and drink from bottles of beer while chatting to young women. Despite what the controversial kissing scene in the film would suggest, Princess Elizabeth had already met Phillip by 1945
