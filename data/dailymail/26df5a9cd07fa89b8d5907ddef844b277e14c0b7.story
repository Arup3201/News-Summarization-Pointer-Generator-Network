Top independent schools are for children of oligarchs as British parents have become priced out of the market, according to a leading headteacher.

Andrew Halls, head of King's College School in Wimbledon, south west London, said an 'endless queue' of rich families from outside Britain had led to a rise in fees at the £20,000-a-year school.

He claims the 'limitless' costs had forced local lawyers, accountants and military officers to stop sending their children there and it was a 'ticking time-bomb' he likened to the 2008 financial crisis.  

Andrew Halls, head of King's College School in Wimbledon, says British parents can no longer afford fees as an 'endless queue' of rich families from outside the UK push up costs at the £20,000-per-year school

The 185-year-old school, which has been named by Sunday Times as independent school of the year, charges £19,455 a year for senior school boys aged 13-18 and girls aged 16-18.

Mr Halls told the paper: 'We have allowed the apparently endless queue of wealthy families from across the world knocking at our doors to blind us to a simple truth: we charge too much.

'Somewhere along the way, first the nurses stopped sending children to us, then the policemen, the armed forces officers, the even the local accountants and lawyers.

'The most prestigious schools in the world teach children of the very wealthiest families in the world.

King's College School was named as independent school of the year, but its headteacher says less local lawyers, military officers and nurses are sending their children their because it 'charges too much'

'We are in danger of coming across as greedy because we can charge what appears to be limitless fees, but in truth there is a fees time-bomb ticking away. It feels like the build-up to the banking crisis.'

The cost of sending a child to private schools has risen by about a fifth in the last four years - around four times faster than rises in earnings, according to recent research.  

Mr Halls suggested a collapse could be brought about by the supply of foreign families eventually drying up, while British families could elect to send their children to high-performing state schools.
