A South African man has appeared in court accused of torturing his five children and keeping them captive for as long as 16 years.

The 36-year-old from Johannesburg is alleged to have abused his children who were aged two to 16 and even used electric cables and a blow torch to harm them.

The man is described as a successful Afrikaans businessman, but is not being named to protect the identity of his children.

Beeld, an Afrikaans-language newspaper reported that his children had never been to school or had left the house.

It is also alleged that the man's wife told police that he also assaulted her by stripping her naked and assaulting her.

It is thought that the case came to light last week when his 11-year-old son broke free from the house, alerting neighbours to call the police.

Police then rescued four of the children, as the boy who escaped was secretly taken to relatives in a neighbouring province.

However, his wife eventually informed the authorities where they boy was.

Beeld also reported that when police searched the house, they uncovered chains, blowtorches, ropes and pornographic DVDs.

On his appearance in court, a small number of protesters gathered outside saying the man should be refused bail. 

The man was remanded in custody and will reappear in court again next month.

According to AFP, the children were being cared for in a safe place separately to their mother.
