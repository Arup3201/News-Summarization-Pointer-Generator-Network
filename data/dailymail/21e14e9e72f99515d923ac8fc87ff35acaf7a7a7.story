Parents who deprive their children of love and kindness could be jailed for up to ten years under a proposed new law.

Changes to child neglect legislation would make ‘emotional cruelty’ a crime for the first time under what is being dubbed a ‘Cinderella Law’.

David Cameron vowed there is 'nothing more important than the protection of children', as details emerged of the new offence which is expected to be included in the Queen's Speech in June.

The new law would make it a crime to 
deliberately harm a child’s ‘intellectual, emotional, social or 
behavioural development’ and sits alongside the physical or sexual abuse
 of children.

Those found guilty would face up to ten years in jail. The change will update existing laws in England and Wales.

Currently, adults responsible for a child can only be prosecuted if they have deliberately assaulted, abandoned or exposed a youngster to suffering or injury to their health.

The updated law could include deliberately ignoring a child or depriving them of love over prolonged periods, which would be deemed to have damaged a child’s emotional development.

The Prime Minister's official spoeksman said: ‘There is nothing more important than the protection of children.

'This is an area of concern. One of the issues that has been raised by the groups that have considerable expertise in this area is that the law has not been updated for some time.

'In terms of legislation, I cannot comment on what may or may not be in the Queen’s Speech but it is certainly something that is under very active consideration.’

Other new offences could include forcing a child to witness domestic violence, making a child a scapegoat or forcing degrading punishments upon them.

Robert Buckland, a Conservative MP and part-time judge who has been campaigning on the issue, said the ‘time for change is long overdue’.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: ‘Not too many years after the Brothers Grimm popularised the story of Cinderella, the offence of child neglect was introduced.

Overdue: Robert Buckland said: 'Our criminal law has never reflected the full range of emotional suffering experienced by children'

‘Our criminal law has never reflected the full range of emotional suffering experienced by children who are abused by their parents or carers. The sad truth is that, until now, the wicked stepmother would have got away scot free.’

He added: ‘We need a clear, concise and workable definition of child maltreatment — an alternative code that reflects the range of harm of done to children and which provides appropriate legal mechanisms to tackle some of the worst cases.

'Emotional neglect must be outlawed, the term "wilful" should be replaced and the criminal law should be brought into line with its civil counterpart.’

As many as 1.5 million British children are believed to suffer from neglect. The legal changes will allow police to intervene earlier and build a criminal case before children are physically or sexually abused.

At the moment, civil intervention by social workers is only possible when abuse is classed as emotional neglect.

Campaigners pushing for a change in the law have included Women’s Aid, which says current legislation focuses too much on specific incidents, such as an assault – and not enough on psychological harm.

They also say the law fails to take into account power and control, which are the essence of domestic abuse.

Women’s Aid, domestic abuse group the Sara Charlton Charitable Foundation and stalking advice service Paladin have also urged the Government to criminalise ‘coercive control’, patterns of abusive behaviour that causing psychological harm, in order to make it easier to prove long-running abuse.

In an online survey of 258 abuse victims carried out by the groups between December and last month, 88 per cent said they did not think the criminal justice system took psychological harm into account.
