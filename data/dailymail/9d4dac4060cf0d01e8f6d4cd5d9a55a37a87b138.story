An 11-year-old girl has been charged with beating a two-month-old baby to death while her mother was babysitting the newborn. 

The unnamed pre-teen appeared at the Lake County Juvenile Court in Ohio on Monday to be formally charged with murder in connection to Zuri Whitehead's death last Friday.

Photographs captured by WOIO show the 11-year-old sitting silently and with her head down in the court room as the judge addresses her.

She had been on a downstairs couch with her mother, 39, and Zuri when her mother fell asleep around 3am on Friday, Wickliffe police Chief Randy Ice said at a news conference on Monday.

The mother was awakened less than an hour later by her daughter, who was holding the badly injured infant.

Accused: The unidentified 11-year-old girl is pictured in court in Lake County, Ohio on Monday after she allegedly beat a two-month-old baby to death on Friday as her mother cared for the newborn

Tragic: Zuri Whitehead, pictured, was badly beaten while she was being watched by a friend of her mother's on Friday. Police say that the babysitter's 11-year-old daughter beat the baby, who later passed away

Ice said the 11-year-old had taken the infant upstairs while her mother slept, and when she returned downstairs, the infant was bleeding and her head was badly swollen.

The 11-year-old's mother immediately called 911, Ice said. She told the dispatcher that Zuri was having trouble breathing and that her eyes were closed, according to WOIO. 

Zuri was flown to Lake West Hospital and later transferred to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland but passed away during surgery on Friday morning, police said.

The baby had suffered 'massive brain injuries, severe damage to the liver, spleen and kidneys, and extensive internal bleeding,' Ice said.

'An autopsy performed by the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office determined that the cause of death was multiple blunt force trauma to the head and torso,' police said in a statement. 'The death has been ruled a homicide.' 

The mother of the 11-year-old and Zuri's mother, Trina Whitehead, had known each other for five or six years but weren't related, Ice said.

Trina Whitehead has three other children and had the girl's mother keep Zuri overnight to give her a break. 

Juvenile: A judge ordered the girl to undergo a competency trial, which will be carried out over the next month

Heartbreaking: Zuri had been staying in an apartment in the 1500 block of Ridgewick Drive, Wickliffe (pictured) overnight on Thursday to Friday to give her mother, who has three other children, a break for the night

The 11-year-old girl's is not facing charges at this time, Ice said. 

Neither Ice nor a Lake County juvenile court official could recall a murder suspect being as young as 11.

Court administrator Chris Simon said 13 is the youngest age that children are typically detained at the county's juvenile detention center, where the girl is being held. 

Juvenile Judge Karen Lawson entered a not guilty plea for the girl at a detention hearing Monday and ordered that she undergo a competency hearing, which will likely be held over the next month.

The girl cannot be tried as an adult. A child must be at least 14 years old in Ohio to be turned over to adult court.

An 11-year-old can, however, be sentenced to a state Department of Youth Services facility until age 21.

The middle school the girl attends had called police about the girl on one occasion for a non-violent incident, Ice said. The girl and her mother have been questioned.

The girl did not show any remorse, Ice said. 'I'm not sure she appreciated the gravity of what she did,' he said.

The girl's public defender declined to comment on Monday.

Ice is considering counseling for the officers who responded to the scene.

'We're having a hard time getting (our) heads around this,' he said. 'You don't see stuff like this.' 

Neighbor Devyn Woods called the situation 'absolutely heartbreaking'.

He said: 'All I saw was four cop cars lined up and I knew something was happening. But I didn't know to the gravity of the situation. It's terrible.'
