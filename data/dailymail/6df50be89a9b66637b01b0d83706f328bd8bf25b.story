If he is looking a bit glum, perhaps it’s because he’s just seen the forecast. 

This Christmas is highly unlikely to be a white one, according to meteorologists.

Instead, it will bring a mixture of rain and bright spells across the country – alongside rather mild temperatures.

Bad news: If he is looking a bit glum, perhaps it's because he's just seen the forecast. This Christmas is highly unlikely to be a white one, according to meteorologists

And with highs of 11C on Christmas Day, this extremely well-insulated robin may even find himself feeling slightly toasty.

Martin Hicks, who snapped  the bird perched on a string of fairy lights in the garden of his home in Crawley, West Sussex, said: ‘I’ve never seen such a fat-looking robin. It just sat there staring at me.’

But while the round robin may look like he has swallowed a bauble or a few mince pies, experts said his size was probably not due to over-eating.

Grahame Madge of the RSPB said: ‘They eat more in the winter as they need more energy to survive the cold. Eating more creates a fat store but it doesn’t usually make difference to their weight as they burn it off quickly.

‘They fluff up their feathers during cold weather so they  trap air close to the body to keep them warm.’

For
those of us who aren’t able to use such tactics, umbrellas and 
raincoats may come in useful today instead, as persistent showers are 
forecast into this evening.

The South-West is set to get the worst drenching, and there is a risk of localised flooding with two-and-a-half inches of expected to fall in less than two days.

Other parts of Britain have also been warned to brace themselves as successive bands of heavy rain move across the country. The Environment Agency said swathes of southern and south-western England, south-eastern Wales and the Midlands should be alert to the possibility of flooding today.

Looking ahead to Christmas Day, Met 
Office forecaster Dan Williams said: ‘At this early stage, it looks that
we won’t see a white Christmas for a large part of the country. Perhaps
there will be a chance of snow on highest Scottish peaks.

‘Generally, it is looking like it will be a mild day for much  of Britain, with temperatures of up to 11C.’

Travel
to the Isles of Scilly will be much harder over Christmas after Land's 
End Airport announced that it will close from today until December 27 because of the severe weather.

The west Cornish airport only reopened on Tuesday after closing on Friday due to a waterlogged runway.

Worse is yet to come: Shoppers in Exeter, Devon, endure rain yesterday but conditions were expected to get worse overnight

It means families may have difficulty getting to and from the island to visit loved ones for Christmas.

Nick
Sanders, Group Commercial Manager for the Isles of Scilly Steamship 
Company, said: 'The water table at Land's End in this weather - we've 
had 15mm of rain last night - takes us beyond the point of no return 
because of the grass runway.

'Landing heavy aircraft on grass would tear up the ground, so we're now running passengers up from Land's End to Newquay, free of charge.'

Plans to potentially solve the runway problem at Land's End could include hardening the whole runway or bringing in Perfo plastic meshing.

On Tuesday night, the Environment Agency issued three flood warnings for South West England and one in East Anglia.

The band of heavy rain expected to 
arrive in the South West early yesterday morning would exacerbate an 
existing problem with standing surface water, officials said.

‘This will be followed by a band of 
further rain, throughout Wednesday night into Thursday morning,’ the 
agency added. ‘The outlook for the weekend is unsettled.’

A further 41 areas have been put on 
flood alerts, mostly in the 
South West, but also in the South East and 
North East of England as well as parts of the Midlands.

Emergency services in Devon and Somerset are advising motorists of the dangers of ignoring warning signs and driving through floodwater.

The fire service said conditions could be similar to those experienced at the end of last month - with heavy rain falling on already saturated ground.

During one 24-hour period in November alone, Devon and Somerset Fire Service attended 51 incidents involving vehicles stuck in floodwater.

For days after the flooding, crews were still being called to vehicles stranded in floodwater after motorists had ignored or moved road closure signs.

Fire officers are asking residents not to drive through floodwater, as they could be putting themselves or others in danger.

Crews attending preventable incidents could also be diverted from other incidents where lives are at risk.

Area manager Alex Hanson said: 'It is impossible for motorists to tell how deep water is or the condition of the ground beneath.

'There is a significant risk to life if motorists become stranded.

'We recommend that people do not make non-essential journeys tonight or tomorrow morning if they live in areas prone to flooding.

'If they do see floodwater on the road, they should not attempt to drive through it but should try to find an alternative route.

'And if a road has been closed, it is for the safety of the public and closure signs should be respected.'

Large swathes of England and Wales 
were brought to their knees last month when flood water surged through 
streets and down roads.

Communities were cut off and dozens of residents were forced to flee their homes, while travel became a dangerous minefield.

Rivers burst their banks and fields were flooded as several days of rain fell in just a few hours.

Many people in 'risk' areas will now 
be torn between going to see their loved ones and staying at home to 
save what they can if their houses are hit by more floods.

With the ground already saturated, the wet weather is likely to lead to property flooding from rivers and surface water as well as disruption to road and rail networks.

The counties of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex and Northamptonshire are particularly at risk, and people are being urged to keep up to date with the latest information from the Environment Agency website, sign up to free flood warnings, check their route for disruption before travelling, and not to drive or walk through floodwater.

Craig Woolhouse, flood risk manager at the Environment Agency, said: 'Our teams are out around the clock to minimise the risks and prepare for flooding, clearing drainage channels and ensuring that flood defences are working properly.

'We urge people to keep up to date with the weather forecast and local news overnight and remain prepared for flooding in their area by signing up to receive free flood warnings and staying away from dangerous flood water.'

For the past three weeks, huge swathes of the Somerset Levels have remained submerged as the deluges from the November storms continue to cause misery and the forecast new rain will only add to the chaos.

One family forced to rush to safety from their home after costly new flood defences in a Worcestershire village failed last month have been given a home over Christmas by the local vicar.

The Crosby family had to evacuate their rented house after expensive pumps were overwhelmed and stopped working at the Kempsey flood defences.

The vicar of Kempsey, the Rev Mark Badger, has taken his house in Worcester off the market and has given it to the family to stay in so they have a roof over their heads for the festive season.

Malcolm Crosby said the offer was 'very generous and really unexpected' and said it meant his family would now have 'a bit of stability before Christmas'.

The Kempsey flood defence pumps were officially unveiled in July, as part of a £1.5m project that included earth embankments and a series of sluice gates.

About 30 houses in the village were evacuated in the early hours of Sunday November 25th after heavy rain led to flooding.

Traffic information company Inrix said around 18 million drivers could take to the road this festive season, and driving home for Christmas could take up to six times longer than usual in places - especially if the roads are icy and wet.

Tyre company Michelin said those living in London would travel the furthest, motoring an average of 167 miles (269km). It added that around 7% of drivers had changed their travel plans due to the rising cost of petrol.

Wash out: The Environment Agency issued three flood warnings for South West England and one in East Anglia, plus 41 flood alerts in the South of England and the Midlands

British Airways predicted its busiest day would be Friday, with the airline handling more than 100,000 passengers.

Even on Christmas Day, BA will carry 27,000 people, with the busiest day after the Christmas break being January 2, when more than 91,000 passengers will fly.

Top long-haul destinations for BA this Christmas are New York, Miami, Cape Town, Dubai and Hong Kong, while the top short-haul spots are Edinburgh, Geneva, Glasgow, Amsterdam and Manchester.

Gatwick said around 1.5 million people would be travelling through the West Sussex airport between December 17 and January 2.

Its busiest departure date is set to be Saturday, with around 56,000 festive travellers leaving.

Gatwick’s top three Christmas destinations are Geneva, Edinburgh and Dubai.

Travel website lowcostholidays.com said its top-selling destinations for the festive period were Tenerife, Egypt, Dubai, Malta and Mexico.
