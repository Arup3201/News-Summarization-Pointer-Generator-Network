When Samantha Manns' great grandmother died in February the 18-year-old says she was left with a hole in her heart that she didn't immediately know how to fill.

It wasn't until reflecting on her great grandmother Virginia Booth's 89-years of life that it dawned on her.

'Some of her last words were, "I don’t want anybody to be upset." And I was really upset for a few days,' Ms Manns told the Chillicothe Gazette. 'Then I thought, "Maybe I can’t be happy right now, but I can do things to make other people happy."'

Inspired: Ohio teen Samantha Manns has set out on a mission to complete exactly 89 random acts of kindness in memory of her grandmother Virginia Booth's 89 years of life, both pictured here

Sharing: Since Ms Manns' page's creation late last month, five day's after her grandmother's death, she has received more than 7,000 'like's while documenting her work

It was at that moment she set out to share the same love and happiness that her great grandmother, whom she had nicknamed Jinjey, had bestowed upon her.

'I am performing 89 acts of kindness to remember the 89 years my great grandmother spent sharing her kindness,' she wrote on a Facebook page dedicated to documenting and sharing her effort.

And in effect, she has remarkably inspired others to do the same.

'Act One; Tuesday, February 19, 2012,' she documents on her Facebook page of her first act while driving with her mother.

'I went through the McDonald's 
drive-through and placed my order, then continued to the first window 
like normal. I paid for the woman behind me, too,' she writes. 'When I 
watched her reaction upon receiving her paper instead of a receipt with a
cost on it; she started to cry and smiled huge! It made me very happy 
to see her reaction.’

In memory: Ms Manns posted this photo of her grandmother, she nicknamed Jinjey, holding one of her great granddaughters on her lap

Paying it forward: After losing her grandmother, center, Ms Manns, right, set out to fill the hole left in her heart with random acts of kindness that she believes expresses her grandmother's own life

Traveling: Ms Manns is carrying her project to Columbus after starting school at the Vet Tech Institute where she hopes will lead her to a career fighting animal cruelty

But trying the act for a second time two days later proved to be even more rewarding as she found.

'Act Two; Thursday, February 21, 2013: Again, another drive-through pay it forward :) But this time, the act began a chain, and the man paid for the car behind HIM! What an awesome experience!' she writes.

The Ohio teen has continued on, documenting her effort that so far includes several donations to her local humane society, a surprise birthday cake for a friend and in her latest effort giving blood.

In a matter of days since her page was created on February 20, her page has received more than 7,000 'likes.'

She's asked that those with other ideas toward her goal - which she acknowledges will take many months - directly contact her on her site.

'I want to really stress that even though I'm gaining (a lot) of popularity, it's really all about helping people, and about what Jinjey would have wanted for something like this,' she wrote on her page on Wednesday.

'I want people to feel the happiness that comes with giving selflessly and with caring uncontrollably. While it's a good feeling to be known, it's an even better and more rewarding feeling to know I'm inspiring people to commit their OWN acts of kindness! Thank you, everyone who has been supporting me and Jinjey through this!'
