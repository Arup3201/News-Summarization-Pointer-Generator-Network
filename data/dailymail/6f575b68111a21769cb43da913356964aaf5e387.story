The mistress of married 60 minutes correspondent Steven Kroft sent him raunchy selfies while he demanded she dress low key in a bid to keep their illicit affair secret.

The messages between veteran broadcaster Kroft, 69, and Lisan Goines, 41, include pictures of the corporate lawyer posing in her underwear.

The newsman also asks her a number of raunchy questions - including how many New Years resolutions she had broken. 

Ahead of a date at the Park Hyatt in the capital in September 2011, he told her dress 'in Washington is Either professional or Laura Bush' and insisted she did not look like Beyonce to avoid attracting attention. 

A source told the New York Post's Page Six Kroft was 'really paranoid about right-wing zealots' finding out about their three-year illicit affair and threatening his career at CBS. 

They also said: 'He was unwilling to be seen publicly with [Goines] because she’s black — because they’d be more noticeable.'

Affair: Lisa Goines, the mistress of married 60 minutes correspondent Steven Kroft, would send him selfies posing in her underwear while they exchanged raunchy messages  

Demands: The newsman told Goines (pictured) to dress more like Laura Bush and not Beyone in a bid to keep their affair a secret. He was reportedly paranoid 'ring-wing zealots' would find out about the illicit relationship

The paper  reported that Kroft boasted in the texts about his rapport with President Obama who he has interviewed on numerous occasions.

Their source said: '[Kroft] definitely said Obama feels comfortable with him, because he was the first person to take him seriously when he was running for president,” the insider said. They have a rapport. They used to smoke together.'

Kroft's representatives however have denied the allegations, saying they are 'filled with distortions, exaggerations and outright falsehoods.'

In the string of messages Kroft says: 'Wanting to taste you again' before Goines replies by saying 'same here'. 

The next morning he the told her: 'Gonna explode if I can’t have you soon.'

While staying in the same Washington Hotel they had a date in he messaged Goines saying: 'I’m in my room at the same Washington hotel where I remember having you for a four hour full course Meal plus desert.'

Illicit: The texts between the pair included selfies of Goines while Kroft arranged to meet her at a hotel 

Plans: The messages also include Kroft asking how many New Years resolutions she had broken and how the pair should celebrate Kroft's birthday 

He also said: 'Very hard playing golf with A bulge in my pants.' 

Earlier this month, a week after the veteran correspondent admitted to a lengthy affair with Goines , a snap has emerged of the pair together. 

The pair, who are both married, met for drinks at the five-star Essex Hotel and were later seen kissing in the back of a cab, according to the National Enquirer.

Kroft has admitted to the affair, calling it 'a serious lapse in personal judgment' after the magazine revealed that the duo had carried on a three-year relationship.

'My wife and I are committed to each other and are working hard to get past this,' he told the New York Post. 

'Mistress': 41-year-old Goines, who is also married, met 69-year-old Kroft in a hotel bar in 2011

The 60 Minutes correspondent, who is married with one son, and Goines hooked up in hotels across Manhattan and Washington, D.C. after meeting at a bar in 2011, it reported.  

Kroft had spotted Goines - who was then engaged to be married - from across the room in the St Regis and went to talk to her and her friend.

While her friend was using the restroom, 'Steve quickly told Lisan, "I have to see you again",' a source said.

A few weeks later, they arranged to meet for cocktails and afterwards, he handed her a room key so he could be alone with her, convincing her he was in a sexless marriage, the Enquirer reported.

Throughout their affair, Kroft and Goines exchanged a series of racy text messages, including one in which he told her he 'would rather be eating your pudding' than be at work.

'Don't work too hard this week bc I wanna wear you out afterward,' Goines reportedly replied.

In another message, he told her: 'Miss you and all that goes with it. Especially my favorite tastes and colors... pink and brown,' according to the publication. 

He also asked her what her 'preference' would be, and she reportedly responded:  'U all over and deep inside of me.'

Sources also revealed the couple's bedroom habits, including his use of Viagra and how he poured champagne in her behind before drinking it.

But while their affair began at the $700-a-night Four Seasons hotel, it quickly lost its luxurious edge and went 'kind of low end', a source said.

She would often meet him while he was working in Washington D.C. and once asked him to buy her a ticket, and he agreed but only footed the bill that once, the report added.

'The whole thing soured because she got to the point where it was only about Steve,' a source said.

They added that Goines never had any intention of leaving her husband and did not want Kroft to leave his wife, so ended it - until they were spotted out in Manhattan together on December 17.  

Questions: Kroft, pictured left in 1992 with Al Gore (center) and Bill Clinton (right) famously confronted Clinton about his womanizing during an interview during his election campaign in 1992

The reports come more than two decades after Kroft confronted Bill Clinton over his womanizing when he was Arkansas governor. 

He has been married to Conant, 55, for 23 years. She is a journalist and author of four books about World War II, including three New York Times bestsellers, including 'A Covert Affair: Julia Child and Paul Child in the OSS'.

The couple lives in New York and they have one son, John.

Kroft joined CBS in 1980 and has been with 60 Minutes for 26 years. His reporting has earned him three Peabody Awards and nine Emmy awards, including a lifetime achievement award.

He told the New York Post that his 'personal failure' has no impact on his job as a journalist.
