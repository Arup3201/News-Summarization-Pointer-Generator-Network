A British backpacker sparked a major search and rescue operation in Australia after his belongings were found at a suicide spot - while he spent the night with two girls he met on a night out.

Joe Stuttle, 19, was touring Tasmania on a bike on his gap-year when he left his bike and bag containing his passport chained to a fence while he hit the bars.

But unbeknown to him, the student had left his belongings at a notorious suicide spot when he went into a nearby town to watch the Christmas lights get switched on.

Mr Stuttle went drinking and met two girls who invited him to stay at their house and only returned to get his valuables the next day.

He was amazed when he turned up at Launceston Gorge at lunchtime last Saturday and found dozens of officers and TV crews searching for him.

Police had even contacted his parents in Billingborough, Lincolnshire, telling them their son was missing.

But an embarrassed Mr Stuttle had to admit to police he had spent the night with two local girls which is why he left his belongings chained up and his tent was left empty.

Alert: Joe Stuttle's belongings were discovered not far from a bridge in Cataract Gorge, Tasmania, which is a notorious suicide spot

Speaking earlier today, he said: 'It's a long story. I met someone and slept in Launceston. I had a great night but when I came back in the morning, I found my bike stolen.

'Thankfully there were 30 officers in hiking gear from state police so I asked them and it turned out they were looking for me.

'There was an incredible fuss but it really is a reflection of the fantastic work of Tasmanian police. They were efficient, fast and friendly.

'They had a formal press announcement within two hours of finding the bike, after interviewing everyone who had seen me.

'They phoned people I knew in England and Australia, organised search parties and informed my family.

'But when I sauntered back like an idiot, they didn't even seem to mind. They were just happy I was safe.

'I shouldn't have left my passport and everything out all night and I should have come back at 8am instead of noon.

'But I got a bit on two TV stations and a ride in a Holden police car, which I've wanted to do ever since I've arrived.'

False alarm: Backpacker Joe Stuttle returned to the area he had left his gear after spending the night in Launceston, Northern Tasmania, to find police and TV crews carrying out a massive search operation

Mr Stuttle apologised for causing such worry, particularly for his parents, and said he was grateful that Australian authorities had taken the incident seriously.

Blogging about his night, he described the moment he met his new friends before realising the commotion at the suicide spot was about him.

He wrote: 'I end up meeting a man called Cat and two cousins called Steph and Alita.

'They are, like all Tasmanians, comically friendly.

'We just met in the street and became friends, it was as easy as that.

'I get a bed for the night with these girls just like it's nothing and it seems strange to them that I'm so grateful.

'Hungry as I am I keep turning down food as these people on this island seem so friendly that to abuse their hospitality would be tantamount to gross disrespect.

'I woke up at 11 and say my farewells to my new friends.'

When he got back to the beauty spot he believed his belongings had been stolen when he was unable to find them, unaware the police had seized them as possible evidence.

His parents Lorraine, 49, and Chris, who still live in Billingborough, were away on holiday and were thankfully not too worried about their son's antics.

His father said: 'Anyone who knows Joe will not be in the least surprised by this story. It certainly didn't come as any surprise to us.'

Joe plans to spend the next 11 months in Australia, after studying at the Robert Manning Technology College, now the Bourne Academy, Bourne Grammar School and The Deepings School.
