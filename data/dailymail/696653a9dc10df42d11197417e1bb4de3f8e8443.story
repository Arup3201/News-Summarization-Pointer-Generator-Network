A TV host who mistakenly received a pair of hamburger earmuffs due to a mix-up with his Amazon order has helped turn the kitsch item into a highly sought-after – and extremely rare - gift this Christmas.

Josh Gates, who hosts the SyFy reality show Destination Truth, ordered a $9.99 T-shirt from the online retailer on December 6, but was perplexed when last Thursday he received a pair of hamburger earmuffs instead.

An avid Tweeter, Gates took to the social media forum to voice his confusion over the unusual item to his 200,000 plus followers.

Gates, who hosts the SyFy reality show Destination Truth, ordered a $9.99 T-shirt from the online retailer on December 6, but was perplexed when last Thursday he received a pair of hamburger earmuffs instead

Mix-up: Gates ordered this $9.99 T-shirt with the title of his SyFy show written across from Amazon, but instead got the earmuffs

Gates initially seemed bemused by the mix-up, but his tweets quickly became more comical as he realized that a set of hamburger earmuffs was something that he had been missing his entire life - even if he had never realized it before.

Over the past week Gates has posted a series of hilarious photos of him wearing the earmuffs in a number of situations and even his girlfriend joined in the fun. He has documented his earmuff adventures on Twitter with the hashtag #HamburgerEarmuffs.

‘I was immediately confused because there were hamburger earmuffs looking back at me,’ Gates told GoodMorningAmerica.com about the moment that he opened the package.

‘I was then immediately amazed and overjoyed by it. They are just so hilarious. Of all the things that could accidentally have been shipped to you, hamburger earmuffs are probably the best thing.’

The publicity that Gates’ viral campaign has created is something most retailers can’t buy, but unfortunately so too are the earmuffs after the company selling them on Amazon sold out of their final few pairs.

ThatsRad had already sold 85 per cent of their stock prior to Gates’ receiving a pair by accident.

In the flurry of publicity after Gates started to posting, ThatsRad quickly sold out of his remaining 30 pairs sold and unfortunately because the product is manufactured in China it will now be weeks before there are more in the country.

ThatsRad owner Todd Herriott told Mail Online that the timing of the sudden spike in interest was unfortunate.

He has been selling the product for the past three or four years and while it has always been a good seller, the publicity surrounding Gates’ tweets meant there was more demand than ever before.

Gates's Twitter escapade has gained him a few thousand Twitter followers to the earmuffs and he says he feels like he has come out on top in the Amazon mixup

Herriott said it was unlikely that he 
would seek to restock on the product because he fears that 
post-Christmas most people will have moved their attention on to some 
other must-have item.

Gates, who has gained him a few thousand Twitter followers following the whole earmuff debacle, has said he really feels like he has come out on top thanks to the mistaken delivery.

'I feel like I won here. Dollars and cents wise, I'm ahead. I just feel like it's a gift. I don't want to return them,' Gates said.

'[Amazon] would be happy to fulfill my original order. … They have not asked me to return them. They'll have to pry them out of my cold dead hands at this point.

'They are weirdly kind of great. They are warm and fuzzy and kind of amazing. It's a Christmas miracle,' said Gates.

Gates' gave the product a glowing review on Amazon, but unfortunately it is now sold out
