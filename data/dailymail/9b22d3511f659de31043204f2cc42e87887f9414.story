Charges of sexual assault against college football champion Jameis Winston from Florida State University that were dropped in December last year are being re-examined once again.

An independent investigator claims to have found evidence that FSU administrators and Tallahassee police 'took steps to both hide, and then hinder' the investigation.

A reporter for Fox Sports News has uncovered thousands of pages of documents.

Winston was the target of a rape investigation after a fellow student said he sexually assaulted her while she was intoxicated back in December 2012 as a teammate filmed the act.

Accused, Jameis Winston: University's police chief obtained original police reports at least four days before the case was turned over to the local prosecutor responsible for investigating serious crimes and filing criminal charges

The main suggestion is that the Tallahassee Police Department seemingly let the case go dormant for nine months.

Police reports were effectively 'sat on' for almost a year before they were given to State Attorney Willie Meggs, but which point the chance of bringing charges against Winston was far weaker. 

Fox Sports News claims that on November 8, 2013, a reporter for the Tampa Bay Times contacted Tallahassee police to request copies of reports of the alleged rape involving Winston.

The Tallahassee police forwarded the reports to David Perry, chief of the Florida State University Police Department. 

FSU officials and campus police then attempted to learn more about the reporter seeking the documents. 

In an e-mail to Perry obtained by FOX Sports, Bonasorte asked, 'Do we no (sic) if its sports dept?'

later that morning the Tallahassee police records clerk sent an e-mail to Perry identifying the reporter who requested the documents.

The university's police chief forwarded the reports to a high-ranking administrator in the Florida State athletic department, and within days they ultimately wound up in the hands of Winston's defense attorney

There was then some debate over a series of emails as to whether a report had been released into the media.

Four days later on November 12, a reporter from TMZ came by to ask for more information over the assault charges. 

This time, Jim Russell of the FSU police responded: 'I can advise you that Jameis Winston is not under any investigation by the FSUPD, nor has he been questioned regarding any criminal case by the FSUPD. I just called the on-duty shift to make sure nothing was breaking right now and they report nothing regarding Winston going on. Thank you for contacting me regarding this rumor – I am glad I can dispel that one.'

Although Russell's e-mail was accurate, Winston, was the subject of an investigation by the Tallahassee Police Department, not the university police department

Russel then sent and email to the FSU Police Chief Perry and Jeanette M. DeDiemar, associate vice president for integrated marketing and communications saying: 'Wow – crazy! Rumor control!'

Two critical witnesses signed affidavits backing Winston's version of the incident even before police had spoken to them

The following day, on November 13, Willie Meggs, Florida's State attorney was notified of the allegations against Winston.

Winston's attorney, Tim Jansen, had received the police reports days earlier. 

In the days that followed, Jansen met with Winston's teammates Chris Casher and Ronald Darby, who had witnessed some of the sexual encounter between Winston and the woman

A notary was hired who recorded identical statements by Casher and Darby swearing that the encounter was consensual before they had even spoken to the police. 

TMZ then published the first report of the allegations against Winston that night, hours after Meggs had first learned of their existence.

By this point, it was almost a week after the allegations had been made and key witnesses had been  

University administrators and Winston’s attorney, Tim Jansen, had a head start on the state attorney in Tallahassee responsible for investigating and prosecuting serious crimes. 

Florida State administrators, had all the police reports at least four days before State Attorney Willie Meggs was handed the case.
