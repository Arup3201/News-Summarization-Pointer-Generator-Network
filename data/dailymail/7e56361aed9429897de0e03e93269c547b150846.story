On Wednesday evening, England's Under 17 side will take on Holland in the final of the European Championships out in Malta.

They will draw inspiration from the one and only other time England have lifted this trophy - just four years ago when they beat Spain 2-1 in Liechtenstein.

That talented side featured the likes of Ross Barkley, Jack Butland, Saido Berahino, Josh McEachran and Connor Wickham.

But what became of the other members of the Class of 2010? Sportsmail tracks their careers since their Euro triumph.

THE STARTING LINE-UP IN THE FINAL

Jack Butland

The goalkeeper played for Birmingham City at that point and had been named their Young Player of the Year prior to the tournament. His fine form continued at the finals, where he earned a place in UEFA'S 22-man technical team selection.

Remaining understudy to Ben Foster, he enjoyed two profitable loan spells at Cheltenham Town in League Two and was attracting a great deal of interest from top clubs.

In the end, after representing Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics in London, he moved to Stoke City for £3.5m on deadline day in January 2013.

Now 21, Butland has been unable to displace Asmir Begovic as No 1 and spent the last season on loan at Barnsley and Leeds United.

Bruno Pilatos

Was highly-regarded at Middlesbrough and had signed a four-year deal in 2010. A broken leg saw him depart the Riverside Stadium last year and he played for Darlington 1883 in the Evo-Stik League during the last campaign.

Luke Garbutt

The left-back has progressed well in Everton's youth ranks and made his first-team debut as a substitute for Phil Jagielka in a Capital One Cup win over Leyton Orient back in August 2012.

Has since spent time on loan at Colchester United, where he made 19 appearances in League One last season.

A member of Peter Taylor's squad for the FIFA Under 20 World Cup last summer after Sam Byram had withdrawn through injury and capped once for the Under 21s, in a 6-0 win over Scotland at Bramall Lane.

Conor Coady

The team captain in 2010, Coady continued to play for Liverpool's youth and Under 21 teams, and made his senior debut in a UEFA Europa League tie with Anzhi in November 2012.

The centre-back made his Premier League debut in a 3-1 win over Fulham at the tail end of the 2012-2013 campaign, before spending last season on loan at Sheffield United.

He made 50 appearances in all for the Blades in an extraordinary season that saw them flirt with relegation from League One before finishing seventh and reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup.

Andre Wisdom

A
 success story from the Class of 2010, Wisdom has made 22 senior 
appearances in the Liverpool back line after being handed his debut by 
Brendan Rodgers in a Europa League tie against Young Boys in 
Switzerland.

Signed a 
new long-term contract at Anfield in January last year and spent a 
successful campaign on loan at Derby County in which they reached the 
Championship Play-off final. A regular in the England Under 21 squad.

Nathaniel Chalobah

Chelsea starlet who has captained their reserve and youth sides, including the team that beat Blackburn Rovers in the final of the 2012 FA Youth Cup.

After impressing in a loan season at Watford in 2012-2013, in which they reached the Championship Play-off final but lost to Crystal Palace, Chalobah signed a five-year contract with Chelsea.

He spent last season on loan at Nottingham Forest and then Middlesbrough and has made 13 appearances for the England Under 21 side.

Will Keane

One of the brightest prospects to emerge from the Old Trafford academy, Keane followed up his England success by guiding Manchester United to FA Youth Cup success against Sheffield United in 2011.

Stepping up to the reserves, he was rewarded with a senior debut in the League Cup tie with Aldershot in October 2011 and a Premier League debut later that year.

Niggling knee injuries checked his progress until this season, where he spent time on loan at Wigan and QPR, helping the London side to the Championship Play-off final. Capped three times for England Under 21s.

Benik Afobe

Arsenal man Afobe is still waiting for his chance in Arsene Wenger's first team and has featured in their youth and reserve sides when not out on loan.

Since the 2010 triumph, he has spent time at Huddersfield Town, Reading, Bolton Wanderers, Millwall and Sheffield Wednesday to gain experience.

Josh McEachran

The much feted McEachran is still waiting for a first team opportunity at Chelsea that grows less and less likely with every passing season.

He made a first team debut for the Blues just a couple of months after the European Championship success against Zilina in a Champions League qualifier and made a number of appearances that season, leading to a five-year contract at Stamford Bridge in July 2011.

Chelsea appeared to have grand plans for him but opportunities were limited and McEachran ended up on loan at first Swansea, then Middlesbrough, Watford and Wigan.

The latter was fairly profitable, helping the Latics to the Championship Play-offs and an FA Cup semi-final, where he played against Arsenal.

Ross Barkley

The outstanding success story of the Class of 2010, Barkley has advanced from Under 17 talent to member of Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad and a Premier League regular in just four years.

He was one of the outstanding players of Everton's first season under Roberto Martinez and featured in 34 of their 38 league games en route to a fifth-place finish.

The 20-year-old made his senior England debut against Moldova in a World Cup qualifier back in September 2013 and was shortlisted for this season's PFA Young Player of the Year Award.

Before winning a regular starting berth at Everton, he spent a little time at Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United on loan.

Connor Wickham

England's match-winner in the final against Spain, Wickham has finally realised his potential this season in helping Sunderland avoid relegation from the Premier League.

His performances for Ipswich Town in the Championship persuaded the Black Cats to shell out £11m for him in the summer of 2011 but he hasn't shown consistent form for them until this year.

A loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday, where he scored eight times in 13 appearances, helped set up a storming end to the season in which crucial goals against Manchester City, Chelsea and Cardiff City kept Sunderland in the big time.

THE REST OF THE SQUAD

Sam Johnstone

Highly-rated Manchester United academy product who has not yet made a first-team appearance but has enjoyed profitable loan spells elsewhere.

Oldham, Scunthorpe, Walsall, Yeovil and, most recently, Doncaster have been the goalkeeper's clubs. He was also named in Peter Taylor's squad for the 2013 FIFA Under 20 World Cup.

George Thorne

West Bromwich academy graduate who has made a handful of first-team appearances and spent time on loan at Portsmouth, Peterborough United, Watford and Derby County.

Brought back to The Hawthorns in the middle of the 2012-2013 season when Steve Clarke was short of players, Thorne impressed in a number of games before a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament ruined his chances of more regular first-team football.

Helped Derby reach the Championship Play-off final, scoring in the semi-final, second leg against Brighton.

Saido Berahino

Striker who enjoyed a breakthrough year at West Bromwich, scoring eight times and playing in 28 matches. Scoring the winning goal at Old Trafford, his first in the Premier League, stood out as a highlight.

Before that, loan spells at Northampton, Brentford and Peterborough showed his goalscoring potential.

Called up to the England Under 21 team at the start of this season, Berahino has been in fine form, scoring six times in five outings.

Robert Hall

Forward who followed up his win with England by signing a first professional contract with West Ham in October 2010.

He would make seven first team appearances for the Hammers, gaining most of his experience in loan spells at Oxford United, MK Dons, Birmingham and Bolton.

Hall eventually joined the latter of those clubs in July last year and played regularly at the Reebok Stadium in the Championship.

Ben Gibson

Middlesbrough defender who has forced his way into the first team this season after useful loan spells at Plymouth Argyle, York City and Tranmere Rovers in recent seasons.

Played 20 times for the Teesside club this season and is set for many more. Called up for the Under 21 team for their recent qualifier with Wales.

Tom Thorpe

Centre-back who is still awaiting a first team opportunity at Manchester United after progressing through their youth and reserve teams.

Helped them win the FA Youth Cup in 2011 and the inaugural Under 21 Premier League title in 2013.

Spent the second half of this season at Birmingham City alongside Tyler Blackett and Federico Macheda but only made half-a-dozen appearances before suffering ligament damage and returning to Old Trafford for treatment. Has one cap for England Under 21s.

Luke Williams

Middlesbrough striker who has made a few appearances for the Riverside club spread over the last five seasons. Gained his most recent football on loan at Hartlepool United last season, where he scored twice in seven games.
