England coach John Peacock has named his squad for next month's UEFA European Under-17 Championship in Bulgaria.

The Young Lions are the defending champions, having beaten Holland on penalties in the final last year, and progressed to this edition with a 100 per cent record in qualifying.

They have been placed in Group D alongside Holland, Italy and the Republic of Ireland this time around and will open their campaign against Italy in Burgas on May 7.

Goalkeepers: Paul Woolston (Newcastle United), Will Huffer (Leeds United)

Defenders: Danny Collinge (Stuttgart), Reece Oxford (West Ham United), Easah Suliman (Aston Villa), James Yates (Everton), Jay DaSilva (Chelsea), Tayo Edun (Fulham)

Midfielders: Trent Arnold (Liverpool), Daniel Wright (Sunderland), Herbie Kane (Liverpool), Tom Davies (Everton), Marcus Edwards (Tottenham Hotspur), Nathan Holland (Everton), Chris Willock (Arsenal)

Forwards: Layton Ndukwu (Leicester City), Stephy Mavididi (Arsenal), Ike Ugbo (Chelsea)

 

The squad contains talented young players from a host of Premier League clubs including Jay Dasilva and Ike Ugbo of Chelsea and the Arsenal duo Chris Willock and Stephy Mavididi, who is called up for the first time.

Liverpool pair Herbie Kane and Trent Arnold have earned a recall after missing the Elite Round of qualifiers last month, in which England beat Romania, Norway and Slovenia to reach the finals.

Their other matches are against Holland on May 10 and Ireland on May 13. 

Arsenal's Chris Willock has been called up to the squad for the first time ahead of next month's tournament
