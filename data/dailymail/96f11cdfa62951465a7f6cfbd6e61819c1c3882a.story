A homeless man's lucky day was cut short by police after he was able to withdraw over $37,000 from a Maine ATM.

Police in Maine are investigating after a malfunctioning ATM at a bank spit out the whopping sum -- though the homeless man originally requested $140.

South Portland police were called to a TD bank branch at 1am on Thursday morning when a man was sleeping next to the ATM, WGME-TV reports. Officers moved him along, but he later returned.Â 

A malfunctioning ATM at a South Portland TD Bank, seen here, dispensed $37,000 to one lucky homeless man early on Thursday morning

At about 5:30am, police received a call from a woman who said a man was spending an unusual amount of time at the ATM she was waiting to use, the station adds.

When officers returned, they saw the same man from before stuffing money from the ATM into a shopping bag.

Lieutenant Todd Bernard told the station that police have dealt with the man before, and that he used his bank card to withdraw $140 -- but the ATM kept giving him more money.

Bernard said a machine glitch caused the man to withdraw over $37,000 in an apparent stroke of good fortune.

The money was returned to the bank, and bank officials said they don't want to press charges. Police continue to investigate the case. The identity of the man wasn't released because he hasn't been charged.

A bank official described the problem as a 'code error' and said no customer accounts were affected.

The ATM in question was listed as out of service later on Thursday.

The ATM now displays a sign which says it's out of service. A bank official says a 'code error' caused one lucky man to receive over $37,000 from the machine
