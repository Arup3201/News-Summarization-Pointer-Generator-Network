A Florida teen has reeled in what could be a record for largest swordfish ever caught in the area.

Adam Satter, 17, is an avid fisherman but was only on his second swordfishing trip when he set sail his father on Labor Day.

When they returned to Jupiter, Florida, they brought with them a nearly 700 pound swordfish.

Big headed: 17-year-old Adam Satter caught a nearly 700 pound swordfish on his second ever swordfishing trip

Massive: The 14-foot fish was so big it had to be towed to the dock outside the boat

According to WFLA, the fish was so big it had to be towed into a dock because it wouldn't fit inside the boat.

The 693-pound fish measured 14-feet long.

The fish was so big, in fact, that at first Adam didn't think it was a fish at all.

'Came up twice. All we saw was a big shadow — thought it might have been a big shark,' the North Palm Beach teen told WPTV.

Incredible: Adam was 30 miles off the coast of Jupiter, Florida when he made the incredible catch

Big as a shark: Before he caught it, Adam thought it was a shark swimming near the boat

After Adam and his dad weighed the whopping fish for official purposes, they generously gave the valuable meat away to friends at the dock.

They kept just the swordfish's impressive bill for themselves.

Adam and his dad told reporters they've submitted the catch in the hopes it will be deemed a record.

In 2010, a 683-pound swordfish was caught off the Florida Keys.

Captain Billy Rabito Jr. presided over the catch of a that October. He was fishing on the Mystique, owned by Katherine MacMillan, 30 miles south of Marathon. 

The fish was caught on 80-pound-test line, spooled on an electric sportfishing reel and was therefor ineligible for the record.

Is it a record? Adam and his dad have submitted their catch in hopes it will be deemed a record swordfish
