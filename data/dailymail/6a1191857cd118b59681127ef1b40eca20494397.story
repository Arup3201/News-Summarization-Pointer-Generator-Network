A mother of two young children was killed in a car crash just days before her husband was due to receive a life-saving bone marrow transplant.

Eileen Petters, 31, died in hospital on April 7 following a head-on collision. Her daughter Autumn, two, and six-month-old son Marley were strapped into the back seat of the car and suffered minor injuries but it was not believed that Mrs Petters was wearing a seatbelt.

Mrs Petters' husband Ryan had been diagnosed with leukaemia for the second time in February and was due to receive a bone marrow transplant on April 19 at Hollings Cancer Center in Charleston, South Carolina. 

Unbearable: Eileen Petters was killed in a car crash in South Carolina on April 7 which injured her son Marley and daughter Autumn. The tragedy occurred days before her husband Ryan was due to undergo a bone marrow transplant for terminal cancer

In her last Facebook post on March 27, Mrs Petters 
wrote about the glimmer of hope her family had been offered.

She wrote: 'WE ARE 
HAVING A TRANSPLANT!!!!! WE ARE HAVING A TRANSPLANT!! EVERYTHING IS 
WORKED OUT WITH MEDICAID, AND THE TENTATIVE DATE IS .... DRUMROLL 
PLEASE!!! APRIL 19!!! HOORAY! HOORAY!'

After losing his wife, Mr Petters' life-saving surgery has been pushed back until May 2 - although his family believe her death has not really impacted him yet.

His father told  Nj.com: 'Emotionally he is doing well, but he has his times just like everybody else.'

Destruction: Mrs Petter was driving her two children when they had a head-on collision with a van on Easter Saturday. She later died in hospital

Ryan Petters has been unable to tell his two-year-old daughter Autumn that her mother has died. 

His sister-in-law Kim Petters told the paper: 'Autumn doesn’t even know yet. She is used to her mom not being there for weeks at a time because she would have to visit daddy at the hospital.'

Mrs Petters' 2009 Honda collided with an Astro 
van at 4.30pm on Easter Saturday in Anderson. 

She was cut from her car 
by firefighters and flown to hospital where she later died from her 
injuries on the operating table. The driver of the van, Perry 
Sutherland, was released from hospital the following day.

Battle: Ryan Petters, pictured with his late wife Eileen and their two young children, was told he his leukaemia had returned in February

Mr Petters was first diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia last 
year while his wife was pregnant with their second child.

He beat the disease after being treated 
with aggressive chemotherapy at the Medical University of South Carolina, traveling four hours for treatment from his home in Belton.

Although he had been given the all clear, the cancer returned in February - and the father-of-two's best hope of beating the disease again was with a bone marrow transplant.

Tragedy: The Petters family had been offered a glimmer of hope when a bone marrow match was found for Mr Petters after an 18-month battle with cancer

Mr Petters, who is originally from 
Harrison Township in New Jersey but moved to South Carolina with his 
wife, still has only a 50 per cent chance of survival.

After
several setbacks, including a donor who backed out of the transplant, a
match was found last month and the operation scheduled for April 19. 
The surgery has now been postponed until May 2.

Following the surgery, Mr Petters must be kept in isolation for three months to lower the risk of infection on his weakened immune system and will be unable to see his children to help them come to terms with the loss of their mother.

The Petters family have struggled under the financial burden and various fundraisers have been organised to help them pay the mounting medical bills of the grieving father.

Kim Petters, who is caring for Marley and Autumn, added: 'When he gets out, we have faith he will make it. We cannot lose him because his kids need him.'
