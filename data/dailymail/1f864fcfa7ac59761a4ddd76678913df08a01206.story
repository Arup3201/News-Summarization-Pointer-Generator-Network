Inappropriate: Nicola Newman, 33, made the comment when her colleague asked why she had not been invited to her hen party

A 'racist' nurse who imitated Ali G in front of a colleague has been found guilty of misconduct.

Nicola Newman, 33, told colleague Marilyn Rowe she was not invited to her hen party in Las Vegas 'coz you is black' in front of other employees at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

The comment, which Ms Newman said was 'banter' left Ms Rowe feeling 'disgusted' and 'quite upset' and was judged by a member of a misconduct panel as being racist.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council accepted Newman, a junior sister at the time, had been imitating the comic character and intended the remark as banter.

But panel chairman John Haines insisted its content was racist, whether it was said in jest or not, adding the behaviour 'clearly' amounted to misconduct.

He continued: 'For a junior sister to direct a racist joke at a staff nurse in a hospital ward is so clearly misconduct that the contrary cannot be argued.

'It's vital to proclaim to members of the profession and public at large that this type of behaviour is never to be condoned.'

The hearing was told the conversation took place in front of other employees and near a patient on ward 10 of Birmingham Children's Hospital.

Newman later approached her colleague to say she had only been 'having a laugh' by alluding to Ali G's catch phrase: 'Is it coz I is black?'

Panel chairman Mr Haines said there was concern at Newman's 'limited' insight into her actions and had decided, as a result, that her fitness to practise was impaired.

Comedy act: Sacha Baron Cohen's Ali G character used 'Is it coz I'm black' as one of his many catchphrases

Asked by Chloe Binding, for the NMC, whether Newman had replicated his accent or body language, Ms Rowe replied: 'No, not at all. She said 'it's because you are black.'

Ms Rowe continued: 'I felt quite distressed to be honest. I was quite upset about it.

'It was a joke about my colour. Something I did not ask for and something I did not find funny.

'I thought it was a racist joke. Words said as humour to one person is not humour to someone else.'

But Chris Green, defending, insisted Newman - who apologised that night - had used Ali G's exact words and added actions to stress her point.

He said Ms Rowe laughed along with the others at first, before abruptly changing her mind.

Mr Green also suggested to Ms Rowe - who said she had used a 'jokey' tone when asking why she had not been invited to the hen do - she should have expected a 'humorous' reply.

The panel accepted Newman's account as it was consistent with the recollections of the other colleagues present.

Newman admitted making an 'inappropriate' remark to Ms Rowe on or around August 12, 2007, but denied being racist.

She was also accused of asking a Muslim colleague Ferhat Shaheen whether she wore a headscarf because her hair was greasy on a night-out in July 2007.

Newman accepted making an 'inappropriate' comment, but denied being racist and using those exact words.

Colleagues: Ms Newman and Ms Rowe had been working together at Birmingham Children's Hospital when the 'offensive' comment was made

The panel agreed the comment was not racist, but 'disparaging to religion' and therefore amounted to misconduct as well.

A third allegation, that Newman asked staff nurse Alia Murtaza at some point in 2006 when Ramadan was going to end because she was 'suffering', was found not proved.

The hearing will continue at a later date, where Ms Newman will find out what sanction she faces for the misconduct charge.
