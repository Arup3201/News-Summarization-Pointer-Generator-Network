David Cameron had admitted that Britain will have to continue to support the Afghan army 'long after 2014', when UK forces are officially due to withdraw.

Speaking at a press conference in the presidential palace, where Taliban forces attacked last week, the Prime Minister admitted that Britain has paid 'a high price' after 12 years of war.

He said: 'While our combat troops will return home, we have already committed to support and sustain the Afghan security forces with financial support long after 2014.'

Mr Cameron said Britain 'has not made any commitments' beyond the military academy but he did not rule out doing more and explicitly said Nato may well need to do more 'to assist Afghan forces'.

Prime Minister David Cameron made an unannounced visit to Afghanistan today to frontline troops in Helmand province as a senior military official admitted that British soldiers will need to stay in the country beyond the end of 2014

He added: 'I want to pay particular tribute to the 444 British men and women who have died serving our country here.

'I think of their families and 
friends. We have paid a high price but since British troops arrived here
 over a decade we have dramatically reduced the terror threat emanating 
from this region.

'We came here to make Afghanistan safer. To make Britain safer. And together we are achieving that.'

Earlier a senior military figure suggested that British troops will be in Afghanistan until the end of the decade.

Despite the start of 
political reconciliation, a senior commander has conceded that British 
troops will have to stay for 'three to five years' after the UK ends 
combat operations in December 2014.

That means British forces could still be in the war zone in December 2019.

Mr Cameron visited the frontline to mark Armed Forces Day and announce plans for a permanent Afghan war memorial in the UK.

Mr Cameron later flew on to Islamabad, where he will hold talks with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari.

Today, a senior diplomat revealed that troops will have to work alongside their Taliban enemies.

Prisoners from the militant group will be released as part of peace negotiations and senior sources say they will be 'put in uniform' in the Afghan military.

That will dismay the families of the 444 British servicemen who have died in Afghanistan since 2001.

It had already been announced that 
170 British troops will remain after the end of 2014 to run the Afghan 
officer academy at Qarga, known as 'Sandhurst in the sand'.

But senior commanders have now admitted that Afghan forces will need far more help than just training.

Nato's
 follow-on mission will also have to help with medical evacuation, 
logistics, planning helicopter operations and integrating ground combat 
with close air support.

Army
 chiefs say the Afghan military are now a match for the Taliban on the 
battlefield, but lack the ability to run support operations properly.

An Afghan operation in Sangin was abandoned recently because the brigade ran out of fuel.

It is also likely that some British special forces will remain to conduct counter terrorist operations.

The UK currently has 7,900 troops in Afghanistan and will fall to 5,200 by the end of 2013.

The number of bases will fall from 11 to four or five by the end of the year.

Mr Cameron's trip was designed to hail progress over the last 13 years.

But
 a senior diplomat admitted that political gains - including six million
 children now attending school - are 'not irreversible', though 
politicians hope that the younger generation of Afghans will resist a 
slide back to the old warlord culture.

Diplomats also admit that the Taliban are likely to win greater power after 2014.

Talks are under way to change the Afghan constitution, which gives 'godlike' powers to the President.

Changes would make it easier for the Taliban to control the Southern and Eastern parts of the country.

Mr Cameron met troops at Camp Bastion in Helmand province before travelling to Lashkar Gah and a forward operating base.

He
 announced £3.8million of funding for military charities, including 
£300,000 to fund a permanent Afghan war memorial at the Armed Forces 
Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.

Another £2.5million has been awarded to programmes supporting treatment and awareness of mental health issues for veterans.

The
 plan will see an impromptu memorial built by troops at Camp Bastion 
flown home and incorporated into a permanent roll call of the dead back 
home.

The new memorial will be erected in 
sand coloured stone over the next 18 months and dedicated once combat 
operations in Afghanistan have ended.

The money will come from banks fined over the Libor scandal.

The
 Prime Minister said: 'Britain must never forget those who gave their 
lives in Afghanistan. A Bastion Memorial Wall back at home deserves 
every penny of this funding.

'It
 will give us a permanent place to remember those who made the ultimate 
sacrifice in Afghanistan and to show how proud and thankful we are for 
all they gave serving our country.

'They must never be forgotten.'

The trip came as General Nick Carter, the commander of British troops in Afghanistan, said opportunities were missed in 2002 to talk peace with the Taliban.

In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, he said: 'Back in 2002, the Taliban were on the run.

'I think that at that stage, if we had been very prescient, we might have spotted that a final political solution to what started in 2001, from our perspective, would have involved getting all Afghans to sit at the table and talk about their future.'

Mr Cameron agreed that talks with the Taliban could have begun earlier.

He said: 'I think you can argue about whether the settlement we put in place after 2001 could have been better arranged.

'Of course you can make that argument.
 Since I became Prime Minister in 2010 I have been pushing all the time 
for a political process and that political process is now under way.

'But
 at the same time I know that you cannot bank on that which is why we 
have built up the Afghan army, built up the Afghan police, supported the
 Afghan government so after our troops have left, and they will be 
leaving under the programme we have set out, this country shouldn't be a
 haven for terrorists.'

Troops could stay three to five years longer than previously announced, the official said (file photo)

A senior No10 source said the National Security Council would have to decide whether British troops would play a wider role after 2015.

The source said: 'The PM has been clear that we have paid a heavy price and already given a lot.

'Our combat troops will leave at the end of next year. The only military commitments we have made beyond 2014 are to part run the Officer Academy and to provide financial support to sustain Afghan forces.

'We have not been asked to do anything more. The PM view is that we have done our fair share and it will now be for other International Security Assistance Force partners to carry the main burden.'
