Celebrities and health fanatics alike have long touted the benefits of drinking water, and now one woman has put it to the test.

Health care journalist Sabrina Bachai told ABC News that she was inspired when she saw a girl on Instagram with 'beautiful skin and beautiful hair' who said that her secret was consuming three liters of water a day.

So for an entire week, she drank the same amount - which equates to a little more than eight 12-ounce glasses a day - and the results were surprising.

Hydrated: Three liters is a little more than eight 12-ounce glasses, or six bottles of Poland Spring

Not only does Ms Bachai say that her skin felt smoother and looked 'fuller', but she also slept better and ended up losing two pounds.

To help her get the water down more quickly, Ms Bachai drank it through a straw. She didn't change anything about her diet, and she stuck to her normal gym routine.

One thing she noticed was that drinking all that water made her feel fuller. 'I wasn't snacking as much, so that helped curb my appetite a little bit. Because a lot of times when you're hungry, you're not really hungry - you're just thirsty.'

The only setback was having to use the bathroom seven to eight times a day.

Ms Bachai may have been pleased with the results of her experiment, but ABC's chief health and medical editor Dr Richard Besser says too much water can actually be harmful.

'Drinking water to the extreme - really 
there's nothing to show that that will benefit you,' he explained.

Strike a balance: ABC's chief health and medical editor Dr Richard Besser says three liters isn't too much, but drinking water to the extreme can lead to seizures or even death

'Our kidneys regulate
 the salt in our blood very finely. If you surpass what your kidneys can put 
out, you'll get something called water intoxication that can lead to 
seizures. In fact some people have died from drinking too much water.'

Three liters, though, is not enough to do any damage. 'For an average man, 
three liters is about what's recommended,' he said. 'I drink that in a day, but I 
do it by listening to my body.'

'If you don't drink enough water,Â  you get dehydrated, your skin's going to look bad and 
you'll feel terrible'

The important thing, says Dr Besser, is to find the right balance and not go to either extreme.

'If you don't drink enough water, 
that's not good,' he said. 'You get dehydrated, your skin's going to look bad and 
you'll feel terrible.'

It's not the first time a woman has shared her success story after increasing her water intake.

In October, 42-year-old Sara Smith revealed to MailOnline how drinking three liters of water a day made her look ten years younger.

Sarah, a mother-of-two, carried out her experiment for an entire month, and by the end she was two pounds lighter and an inch slimmer. Her complexion improved tremendously, and her chronic headaches disappeared.

'I feel fitter, leaner and healthier, and my husband and friends tell me I look ten years younger,' she wrote at the end of the month.

'Who in their right mind would not want to try something which gets such incredible results?'
