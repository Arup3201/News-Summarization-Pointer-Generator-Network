As shivering Christmas shoppers battled driving rain, icy winds and hailstones bigger than pound coins yesterday, their festive cheer was probably diminishing.

They might have perked up, however, had they known the odds of it being a white Christmas have been slashed from 6/1 to 4/1 in London and from 5/2 to 2/1 in Edinburgh.

With such unsettled weather and temperatures falling as low as -12C (10F), it's not difficult to  understand why.

This week is set to be another wet and wild one. Winds and unusually high tides have caused damage in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire

In Cornwall, people had to run for 
cover during a violent ice shower, with some comparing the noise during 
the hailstorm to the roar of a 'war zone'.

Meanwhile flood alerts remained in 
place last night across much of the country, with downpours causing 
travel disruption in the South West and coastal towns across England and
Scotland.

Flights were cancelled as Land's End airport was forced to close for a time due to a waterlogged runway.

Yesterday the Environment Agency had 
seven flood warnings in place, while a further 80 areas in England and 
Wales were under the less serious 'flood alert' threat.

Forecasters said that the deluge 
would ease in the next couple of days but heavy rain and strong winds 
are set to return on Wednesday.

Met Office forecaster Alex Fox said: 'We will see outbreaks of rain and strong winds throughout the working week.

'You will need your umbrella, 
particularly from mid-week. It will not be particularly nice out and 
about doing Christmas shopping.'

The Met Office added that the unsettled weather would continue for the next two weeks.

They said the conditions are too 
unpredictable for there to be any clear indication as to whether snow 
would fall on Christmas Day.

But Jessica Bridge from Ladbrokes said: 'We could be facing one of the biggest ever white Christmas payouts in history.'

After heavy seas and relentless rain fall, fossil hunters in Charmouth in West Dorset, brave the large waves to be first on any overnight cliff falls along the Jurassic coastline

The heavy December rain and strong winds have already claimed a few victims.

An angler who was swept out to sea yesterday has died in hospital it was confirmed today.

The 33-year-old man, from the 
Peterlee area of County Durham, was rescued after getting into trouble 
while fishing at Blackhall Rocks.

But he died at James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough, on Saturday night.

Another man, a 57-year-old, was 
discharged from the same hospital after receiving treatment for shock 
and the effects of being in the sea.

A sailor was also killed on Saturday after waves and hurricane-force winds damaged a ship in the North Sea.

And a Christmas party reveler was rescued from a flooded brook this morning after a late night out.

The unnamed man was found three hours after falling in but managed to save himself by climbing a tree.

It is believed he had answered a 'call of nature' at around 1am but gone
the wrong way and ended up in the flooded watercourse in Exeter, Devon.

He was discovered in the brook by three men who were out hunting nearby.

The Environment Agency today issued six flood warnings and 89 alerts are in place

Rescuers said he slipped into the brook off the River Exe which had swollen to six feet deep after heavy rainfall.

Three fire crews including a specialist rescue tender from Bridgwater, 
Somerset, quickly located the man and used an extension ladder to pull 
him from the freezing water.

He was taken to an Exeter hospital 
suffering from hypothermia.

A major rescue operation 
took place in Sunderland yesterday afternoon after 15 fishermen were 
knocked off their feet by waves which crashed over Roker Pier.

A man in his 60s was left with a broken leg following the incident at 
1.30pm. He was winched off the pier by helicopter and taken to hospital 
in Newcastle.

Rescue teams were forced to evacuate the other men through a tunnel underneath the pier.

The weather was so severe yesterday 
that pensioners were forced to flee their homes because of raging 
coastal floods in Aberdeenshire. 

High tides and drastic conditions led to 25 people being taken from sheltered housing complexes at Stonehaven.

Further north at Peterhead, about 30 people were evacuated from properties in the Roanheads area.

Hailstones the 'size of pound coins' have already fallen in Penzance, Cornwall

After last week's freezing conditions, temperatures are now slightly above average for December, with eastern parts seeing the best of the sunshine. This was the scene in Tynemouth, Tyne and Wear, this morning

Land's End airport in Cornwall has been closed due to a waterlogged runway.

Skybus, which provides flights to the Isles of Scilly, said it had to close following torrential rain until at least Monday.

The grass runaway was only reopened last weekend after being closed for 
more than a week following earlier heavy rainfall this month.

Passengers were being transported to Newquay Airport to get to the Scillies.

Hailstones the 'size of pound coins' have already hammered the southernmost tip of England today.

The balls of ice sent people and animals 'running for cover' in Penzance, Cornwall.

Photographer Mark Stokes was tending his chickens when he was bombarded by the hailstones.

He said: 'All of a sudden the chickens legged it inside and it began hammering down.

'It was really intense - for ten minutes it was like being in a war zone. The racket was unbelievable.'

The 50-year-old hid inside the chicken coop until the deluge of ice stopped, at around 9.30am.

He added: 'The last time I saw hailstones that big was in 1979 in South 
Africa. I never thought I'd see hail that big in England.'

But after last week's freezing 
conditions, temperatures are now slightly above average for December, 
with eastern parts seeing the best of the sunshine, according to the Met
office.

The wet weather did not stop the first Great Lyme Regis pudding race

While
it is wet, the freezing conditions of last week seem to have melted 
away, with temperatures  peaking at eight degrees and dipping to three 
degrees by tonight.

Tomorrow
will have a similar outlook, with scattered and occasionally heavy 
showers and highs of eight degrees, while Wednesday will also be wet and 
windy.

Further rain is likely on Thursday.
