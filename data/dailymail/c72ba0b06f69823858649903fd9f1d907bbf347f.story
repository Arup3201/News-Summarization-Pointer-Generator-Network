The locals complain that they are being swamped by wealthy city dwellers buying second homes in their seaside enclave.

But the buy-up looks likely to continue after St Ives in Cornwall was voted the most sought-after place to live in Britain.

According to a poll by property website RightMove, people believe St Ives would be the most ideal location to reside in.

Trouble in paradise: St Ives in Cornwall has been voted the place we'd all most like to live - but the locals are not happy, because it means they can no longer afford to live in their own town thanks to investors

The coastal locations of Poole, in Dorset, and Brighton came second and third, followed by the historic cities of Edinburgh and York.

Liverpool and Harrogate also scored highly, followed by Bristol, Cardiff and Dartmouth.

St Ives families say they cannot buy homes in their community because outsiders have flooded the market and sent prices rocketing beyond their grasp.

Last month, locals called for all future new-build homes to be restricted to permanent residents only. 

The proposal was contained in a draft version of the St Ives neighbourhood development plan, which they hope will be voted into local planning regulations next year. 

Andrew George, the town’s Lib Dem MP, said high numbers of holiday homes in Cornwall meant some areas became ‘ghost communities’ in the winter when holidaymakers returned to their main residence.

He said: ‘Without a doubt, high numbers of second homes do have a detrimental impact on the opportunities for local families to buy.’

But while many dream of living by the sea, others simply want to live near a good pub.

The RightMove survey found that being within walking distance of a pub was more important than being near a park or supermarket when choosing where to live.

If money was no object, people would choose a detached house with three bedrooms, one kitchen, two living rooms, two bathrooms, a garden and a utility room.

Miles Shipside, a RightMove analyst, said: ‘While we gave people the chance to choose a home fit for royalty, on average they said they would be happy in a more modest home with plenty of space and practical features, instead of rattling around in a massive mansion.

‘This shows that the perfect home for many is one that they know they could possibly live in one day, depending on where they are looking to buy, rather than a pipe dream.’
