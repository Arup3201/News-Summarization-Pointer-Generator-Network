Investigators told a woman who was allegedly assaulted by Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston that her life 'would be made miserable' in the 'football town' if she reported the alleged attack.

The accusation was made by family members of the alleged victim on Wednesday.

According to ESPN, the player's DNA has been found on the underwear of the accuser in relation to the attack which allegedly took place last year. 

Allegations: Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston smiled on the sidelines of a recent game but is now fighting serious claims

The quarterback has been accused of sexually assaulting the woman at an off-campus apartment in the early morning hours of Dec 7, 2012.

The woman immediately contacted police and was cooperative with their investigation, said the family statement first published by the Tampa Bay Times.

When the FSU player was identified as her attacker, her ‘family grew concerned that she would be targeted on campus,’ the statement continued, adding that a lawyer was retained.

A detective ‘told the attorney that Tallahassee was a big football town’ and that the victim should give her allegations some thought because ‘her life will be made miserable.’

Despite the allegations being made almost a year ago, police only referred it to a court last week.

‘Everybody wants to know what's going on,’ William Meggs, state attorney for the 2nd Judicial Circuit told ESPN.

‘So do we. We're in the process of trying to figure out what's going on,’ he added.

ESPN said they had seen the DNA analysis report undertaken by the Florida state crime lab.

The alleged victim carried out a sex assault test at the time of the alleged incident.

The presence of DNA is not an indication of sex assault but does suggest the football player had sexual relations with his accuser.

Meggs told ESPN that investigators plan to use a combination of physical evidence and testimony to determine their course of action.

Officials blamed the delay on the accuser abandoning her cooperation with police in February.

‘In February 2013, the case was classified as open, but inactive, when the victim in the case broke off contact with TPD, and her attorney indicated she did not want to move forward at that time,’ a spokesperson told ESPN.

Accused: Mr Winston can outrun anyone on a football field, but he hasn't yet been able to distance himself from allegations almost a year old

Winston made his customary media appearance Wednesday before Saturday’s game, but the school prohibited him from answering any questions related to the investigation, according to ESPN.

He will be the starting quarterback for this weekend’s game against the University of Idaho.
