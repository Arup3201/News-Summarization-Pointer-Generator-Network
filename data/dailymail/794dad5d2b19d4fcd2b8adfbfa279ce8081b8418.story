Boxer Amir Khan has admitted he was 'silly' to post an online photo of him holding a wad of cash in front of a woman dancing on a pole in a Las Vegas nightclub.

The former world champion, who is a devout Muslim, put the photo on Twitter with the accompanying message reading: 'Let's play lol.'

But Khan, 25, deleted the picture after followers accused him of being disrespectful to his fiancée Faryal Makhdoom and setting a bad example to fellow Muslims.

He has now issued an apology in which he claimed the cash he is pictured holding was 
fake, and that the woman on the pole was not a stripper but a woman 
performing 'acrobatics'.

In hot water: Boxer Amir Khan has admitted he was 'silly' to post an online photo of him holding a wad of cash in front of a scantily clad woman on a pole in Las Vegas

After he put the photo up, Miss Makhdoom, 20, tweeted 'Ew. Woke up to something very disgusting & disturbing.'

She quickly downplayed her reaction adding: 'Oh well! I'll still smile through my day. Hehe.'

But when the backlash started against Khan, who she met in July last year, she then took to her Twitter account defending her husband-to-be.

The New York student tweeted: 'Everyone needs to take a chill pill. I am aware of everything my man does. Thanks for the concern. However, there's a big difference between a strip club & a normal club. I think most clubs in Vegas do have pole dancers. Even I knew that lol.'

Apology: This morning Kahn took to his Twitter to apologise - although he ended up reposting the offending photo next to his statement

'Also, a relationship is all about trust, not stupid stuff like this lol.'

But she was forced to retaliate when a Twitter user wrote: 'Tut tut. What's the world coming to. 
Letting ur fiance dance with other girls and shoving money down their 
knickers haha.'

Miss Makhdoom reposted the tweet and wrote: 'Aw, were u there to witness it all? Lol damn, I 
should hire u to investigate my man. Seems u have a lot of time on ur 
hands. Look within before judging others.'

This morning Kahn took to his Twitter page to apologise - although he ended up reposting the offending photo next to his statement.

'Hi everyone, I want to apologise for the picture I tweeted last week. I admit It was silly of me, but I wanted to make some things clear, first the money I held was fake money the club put on our table and the girl in the back is not a stripper, she was doing acrobatics on the pole.

'It is not a strip club. I wud never spend or waste money that way. I was in a club as a guest but believe I did nothing wrong, that's why I tweeted the picture myself in the first place.'

Just one of the angry tweets Khan received said: 'Sort urself out Amir, when mrs sees this u be knocked out first round.'

Khan later tweeted: 'Just blocked over 100 people on Twitter for talking rubbish.'

In January the couple made their engagement official by exchanging rings 
in front of 1,000 of their nearest and dearest at a lavish engagement 
party.

They celebrated with a £150,000 bash at the Bolton Wanderers' Reebok Stadium.

Friends
including Ricky Hatton watched as Khan presented his wife-to-be with a 
£100,000 platinum ring encrusted with three diamonds.

In return, Ms Makhdoom  gave Khan a platinum ring.

Meanwhile Khan has vowed to make it third time lucky after Manny Pacquiao dropped his WBO welterweight title to Timothy Bradley.

Pacquiao, a close friend of Khan's was beaten for the first time in seven years.
