The Oklahoma City Thunder will have a huge task in front of them tonight as they attempt to level the series with the San Antonio Spurs.

NBA analysts Reggie Miller and Greg Anthony agree that now third best player Serge Ibaka is missing the series with an injury, Scott Brooks' squad are over-reliant on star duo Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.

The Spurs dominated in game one on their way to a blowout 122-105 victory.

Over-reliant: The Oklahoma City Thunder are too reliant on star duo Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook and must find a way to have a reliable third scoring option after the injury to Serge Ibaka

Missing: Thunder forward Serge Ibaka will miss the series with the San Antonio Spurs because of injury

'You just can't rely on Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook because Coach Pop (Gregg Popovich) will live with those guys getting 70 points and seeing where that other 30 is going to come from,' said Miller an Hall of Famer who is now an analyst for TNT.

Serge Ibaka is suffering with an injured calf and is not expected to play in this series. He is the Thunder's best inside defender and also their third option on offence.

The Spaniard was averaging 12 points, seven rebounds and two blocks before injuring himself. Nick Collison started in his place in the game one defeat, but had no points in just 15 minutes of play.

Miller added: 'You would assume it would be Reggie Jackson (to pick up the scoring slack). He's had his way with the Spurs in the regular season, he averaged 21 points and shot almost 60 per cent in their four games.

Third option: Reggie Jackson could be the one to take up some of the scoring slack

'If you're going to start Kendrick Perkins, Nick Collison and Thabo Sefolosha those guys can't have five points combined, because then you're playing two against five.

'If you're the Spurs you can load against Westbrook and Durant. But if those guys score 5-7 pts each then it's a little bit different because you've got to play everyone honest.'

Miller, a five-time all-star with the Indiana Pacers, added: 'I see Perry Jones being a player with potential in this series. I could see him being the type of player getting you seven-10 points. But it's got to be by committee whoever that third scorer is going to be.'

Evergreen power forward Tim Duncan, 38, scored a game-high 27 points in the opener, with Ibaka's absence allowing Duncan to get a number of good, open looks.

The best ever: Tim Duncan, 38, scored a game-high 27 points in game one of the Western Conference finals

Greg Anthony, who played on six teams in a 10-year career, said: 'You have to start by acknowledging that he's the greatest power forward to ever play the game. The most dominant two-way player we've had at that position without a doubt.

'I have no idea how he's been able to continue at that level (despite his age). Pop has been phenomenal to help balance that but it comes down to him being a consummate professional.'

Miller added: 'What I love about Tim is that it's always been about fundamentals throughout his career.

'He wasn't like Charles (Barkley) or (Karl) Malone who had great athleticism or brute strength, he played a thinking man's game.

'It shows if you have great footwork, if you can think the game, you can play at a very high level for a very long time. There's not been a huge drop off because he never had to rely on athleticism, it was more of a chess game for him, whereas a lot of guys have been playing checkers throughout their careers.'

Disruption: If the Thunder are to stand a chance tonight they have to find a way to disrupt the Spurs

Anthony does believe that the Thunder have a chance to steal tonight's game, however.

'The Spurs are the most difficult team to guard in the NBA because the ball finds the right guy,' Anthony, also an NBA analyst, said.

'You don't know where the shot is going to come from when you face San Antonio becasue their ball movement is so flawless and their spacing is terrific.

'That's the challenge for OKC, defensively they have to disrupt timing and spacing. Can you throw them off, get deflections, contain them, get them out of rhythm. If you can do that you can have success.'

Game two tips off tonight at 2am.
