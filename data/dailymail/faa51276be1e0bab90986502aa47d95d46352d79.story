Rohit Sharma hit his maiden World Cup century as India claimed a clinical 109 run victory over Bangladesh in the second quarter-final here on Thursday.

It was the reigning World Cup champions’ 11th consecutive victory in a World Cup, second best only to Australia’s run of 25 matches between 2003-2011, as MS Dhoni won his 100th one-day international match as captain.

Featuring in their first ever World Cup knockout match Bangladesh promised much early on as they restricted India to 125-3 from 30 overs but fell away under the pressure of the occasion, though there was an element of controversy.

The platform for the resounding victory was set-up by Rohit’s measured innings as India posted 302 for six and was backed-up by an impressive 4-31 from Umesh Yadav as Bangladesh were bowled out for 193.

It’s hard to think of another set of fans that turn out in such support for their side and with such vociferously worldwide as the Indian supporters do.

At times the noise from the immensely vocal crowd will tell you all you need to know about what is going on in the middle.

And, while that support no doubt buoys the Indian players, it equally places them under an incredible amount of pressure.

The type of pressure that has seen Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja’s places in the side constantly questioned because of the limited time they spent in the middle during the tournament.

The mere fact that they have batted so little because the rest of India’s batsmen have performed so well is left by the way side.

But if any of the players are feeling the weight of burden upon them then they are refusing to let it affect their game. In fact the players have risen to the task.

Arguably Sharma came into this match as one the few top-order Indian batsmen who had yet to really impress, having made just 159 runs in his previous six innings.

When required though, the 27-year-old rose to the challenge producing some of the best shots of the entire tournament.

The Indian innings began uncharacteristically slowly as Bangladesh’s attack produced a master class in tight bowling.

Shikhar Dhawan, having prodded and probed his way to a modest 30 of 50 balls, was stumped off the bowling of Shakib Al Hasan after being beaten by the flight of the ball and failing to drag his foot back in time.

England’s ultimate destroyer Rubel Hossain erupted in jubilation eight balls later as he had star batsman Virat Kohli caught behind for just three.

The dismissal was all the more impressive, with Mushfiqur Rahim taking a low catch, as the wicketkeeper was stood so far back a car could have fit between him and the stumps.

And when Ajinkya Rahane mistimed a loft over extra-cover from a fuller Taskin Ahmed delivery to depart for painful 19 off 37 balls, India looked to be struggling.

If discipline defined the first 30 overs for Bangladesh, having bowled an impressive 107 of those 180 as dot balls, then meltdown almost perfectly defined the last 17.

Mashrafe Mortaza took the ball in the first over of the batting powerplay and after Suresh Raina sent the ball between two fielders, the Bangladeshi captain stood and berated his players.

However, the game-changing over followed four overs later as Rubel believed he had Rohit caught at deep midwicket for 90, only for the delivery to be called a waist-high no ball.

Confusion ensued, with the Bangladeshi players calling for a third-umpire second opinion but Ian Gould remained unmoved and Rohit remained at the crease.

After reaching his ton off 108 balls the right-handed batsman let loose, lofting a beautiful inside-out drive for six.

Taskin eventually had his man, bowling an excellent yorker – a delivery so rare now but still a marvel when produced perfectly – as Rohit departed to a standing ovation from the 51,000 strong crowd.

It seemed surprising then that the 19-year-old bowler was another who found himself on the end of a verbal rollicking from his captain as India passed the 300 run mark for the third time in the tournament.

At the beginning of the year 302-6 would probably have been seen as an achievable target against an Indian bowling attack that looked anything but international players.

But with MS Dhoni’s pack of bowlers having claimed 60 wickets in six matches Bangladesh needed Tamim Iqbal to fire from the beginning.

Having found the boundary rope four times, Tamim departed for a run-a-ball 25 as Dhoni took a low catch off Yadav’s bowling. Without a run being added to their total, a mix-up in the middle saw Imrul Kayes run-out for five and Bangladesh two down for 33.

Bangladesh did their to best to keep up with the rate but the constant loss of wickets hindered their chances of making the match a contest.

Soumya Sarkar (29), Mushfiqur (27), Sabbir Rahman (30) and Nassir Hossain (35) all made starts but Bangladesh failed to ever really trouble the Indian bowlers who bowled out their opposition for a seventh consecutive match.

While Rohit walked away with the man-of-the-match award, having become the fourth Indian batsman to hit a century during this World Cup, the Indian bowlers contribution to the side remains invaluable.

Ridiculed ahead of the start of the tournament and spoken of as India’s weak link, Yadav, Mohammad Shami and Mohit Sharma continue to carry their side to outstanding victories.

India look intent on holding on to the World Cup and at the moment it would take a very brave individual to bet against them.

The winner of Friday’s match between Australia and Pakistan await in the semi-finals.
