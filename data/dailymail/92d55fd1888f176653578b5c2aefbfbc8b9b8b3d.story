An Arkansas mother is dead and her young son is fighting for life after a 911 operator failed to send help when their car skidded into a pond on Monday.

Jinglei Yi, 39, and five-year-old Leo Yang's SUV hit black ice on a road in west Little Rock at around 8 a.m. and they plunged into the icy water below.

Yi called 911 from the vehicle, telling the operator that she and her son were trapped in the car, which was sinking.

The operator hung up the call and contacted an ambulance service, which was dispatched a few minutes later, but police officers and firefighters weren't dispatched until about a half-hour later â€” after the ambulance service called to verify that they were en route.

Tragedy: Arkansas mother Jinglei Yi, pictured left, died and her young son Leo Yang, right, is fighting for life after a 911 operator failed to send help when their car skidded into a pond

According to a spokesman for the city's police and fire departments, the operator did not enter Yi's call into a computerized dispatching system that would have alerted police and fire dispatchers.

The operator has been placed on paid administrative leave while authorities investigate why she didn't alert dispatchers, but she's not been charged with any wrongdoing.

When they arrived, after 43 minutes, emergency crews recovered Yi and her son from the pond in about five minutes. The mother died hours later in hospital.

After calling 911, Yi called her husband, Dangyong Yang, a surgeon, who rushed to the pond.

'I came right away,' Yang told KTHV, through tears.

'She said "Me and my son have gone into the water." I said "Where are you?" "Some water is in the car," she says, "It is almost to my knees,"' Yang said.

Jinglei Yi called 911 at around 8 a.m. on Monday after her car skipped into the pond.

On the call, a county 
dispatcher describes Yi's situation to the operator in Little Rock while
Yi remains on the line.

Then, Yi describes her location and explains that there is water in her vehicle.

'The water is in my car right now,' she says.

The operator then asks Yi for her name and tells her to hang on.

'OK, ma'am, we're going to get some help on the way for you, OK?' the 
operator says.

Yi responds, 'OK. Thank you,' then the call appears to end.

When the father got to the site his little family was nowhere to be seen.

'I didn't see any car over there. I just saw in the water bubbles coming up,' he recalled.

'Some firefighter (was) changing, preparing to go into the water, I tell him this is too long, it's too late, too late.'

It's still not clear whether the delay played a role in Yi's death.

A doctor pronounced her dead at a local hospital at 11:45 a.m. on Monday.

A medical examiner is expected to determine the exact cause.

On the 911 call, which The Associated
Press obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, a county 
dispatcher describes Yi's situation to the operator in Little Rock while
Yi remains on the line.

Then, Yi describes her location and says there is water in her vehicle.

'The water is in my car right now,' she said.

The
Little Rock operator asked Yi for her name and asked her to hang on.

'OK, ma'am, we're going to get some help on the way for you, OK?' the 
operator said.

'OK. Thank you,' Yi said. Then the call appears to end.

As well as failing to enter the 
details of the call into the system, the operator also ended Yi's call 
instead of using a transfer option that would have allowed her to keep 
Yi on the line while contacting the ambulance service.

Too late: When they arrived, after 43 minutes, emergency crews recovered Yi and her son from the pond in about five minutes and also hauled out the car, pictured

Rescuers: The 911 operator who failed to enter Yi's call into the system has been placed on administrative leave

'Proper protocol would be ... we have a one-button transfer switch where you get (the ambulance service) on the line and you remain on the line with them until you're sure that they have handled the call,' city spokesman Laura Martin said.

The operator, who was hired in March and completed a six-month probation period in September, has not been identified.

Yang said his son Leo's brain was without oxygen for sometime. He has not woken up but is showing improvement.
