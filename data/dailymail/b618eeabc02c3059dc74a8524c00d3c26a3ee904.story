Too many social workers view parents, drug addicts and alcoholics as ‘victims’ who are powerless to turn round their own lives, Michael Gove warned today.

The Education Secretary said his own life was ‘transformed’ by good social workers, who took him into their care before he was adopted.

In an emotional speech today he said the best social workers deserve to be viewed on a par with doctors, barristers and teachers, but he will warn that the training of social workers needs major reform.

Tough message: Michael Gove,
Secretary of State for Education, said some social workers 'acquiesce' the bad choices of feckless parents

Mr Gove was born in August 1967 to a young student single mother, and was adopted four months later.

Describing his own experience today, he said: ‘As someone who started their life in care, whose life was transformed because of the skill of social workers and the love of parents who were not my biological mother and father but who are - in every sense - my real mum and dad, this is personal.

‘A child’s opportunity to flourish should not be a matter of chance - it should be the mission which guides all our actions.’

He warned: ‘I believe that we have not been either systematic, radical or determined enough in our efforts to reform the system of child protection in this country. But that is changing.’

Pledging to ‘strip out’ trendy attitudes within the profession, Mr Gove said that many social workers believe their main role is to secure benefits and services for their clients rather than forcing them to address their problems.

Many are too quick to ‘explain away’ appalling behaviour that can lead to domestic violence and child abuse, he said.

And he warned that the training of social workers needs major reform.

‘In
too many cases, social work training involves idealistic students being
told that the individuals with whom they will work have been 
disempowered by society,’ he said.

‘They
will be encouraged to see these individuals as victims of social 
injustice whose fate is overwhelmingly decreed by the economic forces 
and inherent inequalities which scar our society.

‘This
analysis is, sadly as widespread as it is pernicious. It robs 
individuals of the power of agency and breaks the link between an 
individual’s actions and the consequences.

‘It risks explaining away substance abuse, domestic violence and personal irresponsibility, rather than doing away with them.

‘Social workers overly influenced by this analysis not only rob families of a proper sense of responsibility, they also abdicate their own.

‘They see their job as securing the family’s access to services provided by others, rather than helping them to change their own approach to life. Instead of working with individuals to get them to recognise harmful patterns of behaviour, and improve their own lives, some social workers acquiesce in or make excuses for these wrong choices.’

Mr Gove’s comments are made in a speech to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.

They come ahead of the publication tomorrow of a serious case review into the shocking case of Hamzah Khan who was starved to death by his mother and left in his cot for almost two years.

Sir Martin Narey, the former head of Barnardo’s, is currently carrying out a review of social worker training for Mr Gove, and is expected to call for major changes.

Sources said Mr Gove said better training was vital in improving standards in a profession that has been rocked by a string of scandals.

Mr Gove highlighted the success of the new ‘Frontline’ initiative, which aims to fast-track top graduates into social work. More than 4,000 people have applied for the scheme in its first six weeks.
