Sony Pictures' 'The Interview' has made more than $31 million from its online and on-demand release, according to the studio.

Sony announced digital figures Tuesday for the film spanning its first 11 days of release since debuting December 24. 

Sony had previously said the film made $15 million in its first four days online, so demand for the Seth Rogen comedy has slightly declined as Sony has added more platforms.

While $31 million constitutes the most lucrative digital release for a Hollywood film, 'The Interview' stood to make more in a wide theatrical release. It had originally been forecast to earn about $30 million in its opening weekend alone.

Still, the significant total represents a sizable recoup for Sony after the film appeared dead.

The film follows a entertainment television talk show host and his producer, who score an interview with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The CIA recruits the two men to assassinate Kim.

James Franco plays television host Dave Skylark, with Seth Rogen playing his producer Aaron Rapoport. Randall Park portrays Kim Jong-un. 

After hackers the FBI have said are North Korean threatened violence in theaters showing the film, North America's top theater chains pulled out of showing 'The Interview' and Sony canceled its release entirely.

Sony said in a December 18 statement picked up by media outlets 'In light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film, we have decided not to move forward with the planned December 25 theatrical release. We respect and understand our partners' decision and, of course, completely share their paramount interest in the safety of employees and theater-goers.' 

But cobbled-together release in independent theaters and digital outlets has proven modestly successful. Playing in select theaters, 'The Interview' has made about $5 million in two weeks.

It's currently playing in 558 theaters, far less than the approximately 3,000 it originally planned to open in.

Sony has steadily increased digital operators in the last week, adding cable on-demand providers to a range of streaming options like YouTube and iTunes. 

The studio said the film has been rented, streamed or purchased 4.3 million times.

While the grosses will be divided with each distributor, Sony could potentially earn back the roughly $40 million production budget for the comedy.
