Budget carrier Tigerair is offering dirt cheap $13 airfares for flights around Australia in a four-hour Halloween sale on Friday night.

But the airline is gambling its servers won't be spooked by an expected stampede of bargain-hunters when the sale goes live at 8pm tonight.

The low-cost tickets will be offered on nine routes, including Sydney to the Whitsundays, Brisbane to Darwin, Adelaide to Sydney and Gold Coast to Sydney.

Tigerair says consumers should 'pounce' on the fare deal

'We're certainly prepared for a surge in demand this evening,' Tigerair spokeswoman Vanessa Regan told Daily Mail Australia, adding the company was 'very hopeful' their systems would cope. 

The sale comes less than a week after angry travellers took to social media to criticise Jetstar's website and phone lines crashing in the midst of a one day sale frenzy. 

The special airfares only apply to 'thousands of seats' between June 2 and June 24, 2015:

Adelaide – Melbourne

Hobart – Melbourne

Melbourne – Mackay

Gold Coast – Sydney

Adelaide – Brisbane

Adelaide – Sydney

Sydney – Whitsunday Coast

Brisbane – Cairns

Brisbane – Darwin

Thousands tried to snap up cheap $88 flights from Australia to Bali when seats went on sale, but Jetstar's systems crashed shortly after it began.

As angry travellers vented on Twitter using the hashtag #JetstarFail, the airline apologised to its customers. 

While Tigerair is confident it will avoid a system meltdown, they could face customer backlash over the hidden credit card charge attached to the $13 fares and limited availability.

The fares are only on offer for flights between June 2 and June 24 next year. That is the period before school holidays in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. 

The bargain fare does not include that $8.50 'booking and service fee' for credit card users, although Australian Mastercard debit card holders can escape being slugged the extra fare.

The airfares include 10kg of carry-on baggage.  

Ms Regan said the sale is likely to 'surprise, shock and sweeten your senses' and urged customers to 'pounce' on the deal as soon as possible.
