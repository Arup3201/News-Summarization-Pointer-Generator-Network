Research by the children's watchdog found that 100 per cent of 14-year-old boys in one school had watched pornography (file photo)

Pornography is so pervasive that entire classes of young teenage boys have watched it, the deputy children’s commissioner has warned.

Sue Berelowitz said access to pornography among children was so easy it should trigger 'moral panic' among parents, teachers and ministers.

She quoted unpublished research into access to pornography among children which found it is much more widespread than previously thought.

It showed that every boy and half the girls in a year nine group of 14-year-olds had accessed pornography in one school in England.

Miss Berelowitz said she had evidence that children as young as 11 had been found actively to be 'seeking out pornography'.

Some boys now felt they had an 'absolute entitlement to have sex with girls, any time, any place, anywhere, with whomsoever they wished'.

The watchdog was so concerned that it had commissioned more research to see if boys actually understood what ‘giving consent’ to sex actually meant.

On Tuesday, the Daily Mail revealed that 15 children a day are excluded from schools for sexual misconduct.

This paper has been campaigning for tough restrictions on web porn to protect youngsters, following fears it is warping children’s views of sex and relationships.

David Cameron has promised new protections whereby all new computers will be automatically fitted with web filters unless parents specifically lift them.

But no timetable has yet been put in place to implement the scheme.

Miss Berelowitz made her comments on BBC Radio 4’s Bringing Up Britain, which is examining 'parenting and pornography'.

She said: 'We came across one study where they were looking at the whole cohort of year nine pupils within a large local authority in England.

'The findings were that 100 per cent of 14-year-olds is accessing pornography. And about 50 per cent of the girls.

'The girls did not want to look at the porn – they were being made to by the boys.'

Conservative MP Claire Perry told the Bringing Up Britain programme that parents should tell other parents about the problems of children watching pornography

'We have commissioned research into young people’s understanding of consent... It raises very serious questions about whether boys in particular have any understanding of the concept of consent.'

Miss Berelowitz said: 'No one should be panicking, but why should there not be a moral panic?

'Because what we are uncovering is the scale of what this is doing to children and young people’s sense of what is reasonable.

'If that does not generate some huge moral anxiety amongst us as a responsible population, government and community then quite frankly I would be very worried.'

Claire Perry, David Cameron’s adviser on childhood, told the programme the problem of children accessing sex websites should be treated like a 'public health issue' such as nits by parents.

Parents should contact others, saying 'my child has seen porn, he may have sent it round his classmates, please can we all get together and talk about it', she said.

Miss Perry said: 'One of the worst things is that parents are so shocked and ashamed that they find it difficult to talk to their children, let alone the other parents.'

She said that it was up to parents to take back control of the internet, adding: 'If your children said, "actually mum I want to go and drive the car", or “I would just like to eat crisps and chocolate for every meal”, we would feel we had some level of responsibility or some ability to control those decisions.'
