She is the £10m poster girl for real women whose curves have been voted as second only to Marilyn Monroe.

But it's not just her curves that take the crown when it comes to the public's love of Holly Willoughby.

The most famous girl-next-door in Britain regularly tops best hair, smile and all-round beauty polls too.

Famed for her rosy cheeks, plump lips and smokey eyes, Holly's natural beauty is the envy of women worldwide.

And while she can afford the most lavish
 products on the market, the This Morning presenter has shared her beauty secrets with
 MailOnline - and fans will be delighted to know that most of them come in at 
under £10.

Revealing all: Holly Willoughby, who is often 
voted the world's most beautiful woman, has revealed her beauty secrets 
with MailOnline as she poses for Oral- B's 3D White Lux toothpaste

Speaking about her beauty regime, the TV presenter said: 'My number one beauty secret would be anything that is quick, easy and fits into my life without me having to make too much effort.

'I've got a really amazing body wash at the moment, it's a Sanctuary Spa 2 day moisture shower oil and that's really good because when I get out of the shower I don't have to moisturise so that really works,' she said.

As for her glowing skin, Holly swears by face and body exfoliators. She said: 'I love Liz Earle's Cleanse 
& Polish, I love the smell of it in the morning when I wake up and 
it's really good at taking off those lasting bits of make-up at the end 
of the day.

'I also love the Sanctuary Spa 4 Day 
Moisture Oil Scrub, I use a lot of body scrubs just because I think it 
keeps your skin more even-toned, especially in the summer.

'I
 think people are fearful of them because they think "oh no, it's going 
to scrub off the suntan" but I think it keeps your skin looking all 
nice.'

As for her luscious lips she 
explained that a good lip balm like a Sisley lip balm is very important 
because she is constantly putting lipstick on and off and being under 
the light whilst filming really dries her lips out.

The mother-of-two also swears by Vaseline for her lips and even to help heal cuts and grazes.

Speaking about her beauty regime 
before a big night out with her friends, she said: 'For a night out with
 friends I love a big flicked eye.

'I
 like to have an eyeliner that's almost like a felt tip pen because I 
just find it really easy to control; Lancome do a really good one.

'I use loads of mascara and maybe an eyelash. I have had to practise for a really long time to put those on though.'

She
 added: 'It depends where I'm going but if I want to vamp it up and go 
for a red lip then my favourite is MAC Red or Speed Dial, which is a 
really nice pinky nude colour.'

Holly was recently voted as having the 
best celebrity smile, with dentists
even claiming that many patients actively request the pearly whites of 
32-year-old Miss Willoughby when having whitening treatments. But what's the secret behind her Hollywood smile?

'Being on telly and saying "good morning", the first thing people see is your smile and having a white, bright, shiny smile is really important to me and my job.

'So Oral-B 3D White Lux is a brilliant toothpaste because it keeps the dentist happy by beating tartar and the important things but it makes me happy because it keeps my teeth white, which is just what I need and how I like them,' she revealed.

While she is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful people in the public eye, Holly admires the looks of two very different looking women.

She said: 'There are so many gorgeous beautiful women out there but different women for different things.

'I look at Dita Von Teese and think she is a really mysterious dark sex goddess and a beautiful woman who is committed to her look, and she looks so feminine and striking so I really admire her for that.

'But then on the flip-side, I love the look of someone like Heidi Klum who probably looks the exact same when she gets out of bed in the morning.

'She probably doesn't have to put any make-up on and she has this really fresh, beautiful face and she is just effortlessly natural.'

Holly is currently busy as a presenter on This Morning, has just released a children's book with her sister and is working with Very on her clothing range, but she still has big plans for the future.

Asked if she would ever consider unveiling her own beauty range, the starlet said: 'I get asked quite a lot if I would ever bring out my own range of beauty products.

'Maybe, I do have an interest in it. I really love that side of things. I love getting a new product and thinking: "ooh how does this one work?"

'But I do have my favourite things that I use over and over again. I'm not really very experimental with changing things up so would I?

'I think it's more down to a time issue with me. I have enough on my plate as it is and I want to do the things I'm committed to as well as I possibly can so maybe in the future but not right now.'

The future's bright: Asked if she would ever consider unveiling her own beauty range, the starlet said she has thought about it but wants to focus on her current projects at the moment
