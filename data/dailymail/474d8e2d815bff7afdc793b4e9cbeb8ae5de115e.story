Newlywed NASCAR driver Trevor Bayne has revealed he has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, but said he will continue to race.

Despite the diagnosis, Bayne - who became the youngest driver ever to win the Daytona 500 in 2011 - has been cleared to race and will still compete in the Homestead-Miami Speedway this weekend.

As he announced the diagnosis on Tuesday, he said it had only made him more determined to win.

'I've never been more driven to compete,'
said Bayne, who hails from Knoxville, Tennessee.

Diagnosis: Trevor Bayne, pictured after winning the NASCAR Nationwide auto race in June, has revealed that he has multiple sclerosis - but said he has no symptoms and will continue to race

'My goals are the same as they've been since I started 
racing. I want to compete at the highest level and I want to win races 
and championships. I am in the best shape I've ever been in and I feel 
good.'

Bayne's younger sister, Sarah, also has multiple sclerosis.

The announcement comes just five months after he married girlfriend Ashton Clapp on June 4 - and, speaking to Fox Sports, he credited her with getting him through.

'She's been completely supportive and 
awesome,' he said. 'She's been by my side all the way 
through this... She's never wavered or doubted or 
anything like that.

'She's been completely supportive of whether I announced this or whether I don't. Whatever decisions I've made, she's 
completely stood by me and given me good perspective, and that's been 
awesome.

Multiple sclerosis is a potentially 
disabling disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous
system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.

All the nerve fibers in the body are covered with a protective coating called myelin. It works like an insulating cable, helping messages from the brain get to the spinal cord and other parts of the body quickly.

In MS, the body's immune system turns inward and starts to attack the myelin. When it becomes damaged, the messages from the brain slow down or have trouble getting through. Depending on where the damage to the myelin occurs, this will affect different parts of the body.

Symptoms
can be mild, such as fatigue, or severe, including paralysis, loss of
vision and slurred speech.

There is no cure, but treatment can help manage symptoms and 
reduce the progress of the disease.

It is twice as common in women than men. Between 250,000 and 350,000 people in the U.S. have M.S., and more than 2.1 million people are affected worldwide

'Sometimes she's as competitive, if not more
than I am, about racing stuff, and she's the same about this. We want 
to go after it and, obviously, trust in the Lord and his plan for me.'

Bayne said that plan includes improving awareness of multiple sclerosis, a
chronic neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system.

For Bayne, symptoms began to show themselves around two years ago - but he did not realize what they were indicating.

Just months after winning Daytona 500, he developed swelling, rash and bumps on his left
arm which he blamed on a bug bite.

But when the swelling failed to go down after taking antibiotics and he began to feel numbness, Bayne checked himself into the
hospital.

He later woke up with blurred vision, nausea 
and fatigue and underwent tests at the Mayo Clinic 
in Rochester, Minnesota days later.

He underwent a spinal tap during his hospitalization, and doctors ruled out Lyme disease at the time. Over following months, he continued to return for tests.

'In the beginning they were unsure, and 
they're not going to give it a diagnosis until they are sure,' Bayne told Fox.

'From 
all the testing we've done there through their knowledge and experience 
they were able to diagnose me.

Winner: In 2011, the then-20-year-old became the youngest ever person to win the Daytona 500 race

'I have no symptoms. It was really on our
doing, of continuing to pursue a diagnosis and continuing to find out 
answers.‚Äù

He said that he does not take medication for his condition but manages it with diet and exercise instead.
