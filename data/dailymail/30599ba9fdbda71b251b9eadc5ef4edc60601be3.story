What does the eldest of four daughters need when all of her sisters are either married or engaged? Apparently, a drink.

In a hilarious photo posted by Arlene Lassin, a Huffington Post blogger, the writer shows her friend Lauren Finkelstein standing next to her three sisters, according to the Post.

As her three younger sisters show off their wedding or engagement rings, Finkelstein shows off a bottle of champagne as she pours herself a glass.

Oldest: Finkelstein, 32,  (photographed) is a disc jockey in Houston and the oldest out of four girls 

Lassin wrote that Finkelstein's youngest sister, Melanie, recently got engaged and with that, Finkelstein needed to prepare herself for the impending slew of questions from family members concerned about her 'biological clock' -- hence the glass of champagne.

At 32, Finkelstein is a single,  popular disc jockey on a top 40 Houston station, according to Lassin. 

Finkelstein knows that among the congratulations her sister will receive on her engagement, she will receive just as many questions about when she's going to get married and start a family.

'I've been asked so many times when is it going to be my turn, I've lost count,' Finkelstein told Lassin.

Completely Happy: Finkelstein is 'completely happy, independent, and successful' and the funny photo celebrates Finkelstein's confidence and contentment

Though the photo illustrates Finkelstein's sentiments about the wave of questions she's bound to be asked, Lassin writes that the DJ is, of course, genuinely happy for her younger sister. 

'Most of all, it shows her terrific sense of humor,' Lassin wrote.

'In fact she told her father that her birthday gift to him is his not having to pay for her wedding this year.' 

Lassin said that the four sisters, her friends, are very close-knit and live just minutes from one another.

The sisters, ranging in age from 26 to 32, all socialize together, and are rarely seen without one another, the blogger writes.

Lassin noted that Finkelstein is 'completely happy, independent, and successful.' She wrote that the photo celebrates Finkelstein's confidence and contentment.
