Standing at over 10ft tall this stunning sculpture of a fairy palace takes the art of making sand castles to a new level.

It was built by professional sand sculptor Matt Long, who is paid as much as $70,000 for one of his creations.

Mr Long has made his living building sand castles for the past 12 years and has made elaborate sculptures for clients such as Rockefeller Plaza in New York, Ringling Brothers, and Nickelodeon.

The 58-year-old from Staten Island, New York, said: 'I started creating sand sculptures with my kids about 18 years ago while we were on vacation.

'I saw someone create something in the sand, and I thought, "gee, I can do this."

'These days I don't really create sand castles - what I do is make people smile and that's become it for me.'

His work has taken him across the world where he builds sculptures for private parties, events and corporations.

The fairy palace features a staircase wrapping around a high tower supported by intricate arches - made only of sand and water.

It is so detailed, individual 'bricks' are visible and passersby can see every tiny window. 

Mr Long, who has placed in world championship sand sculpting competitions, was built to showcase his talents.

His most expensive sculpture cost almost $71,000 (£44,000) and was constructed over five days using 200 tons of sand. 

Mr Long said there is a process to follow goes each sculpture that starts with a base pile of wet sand.

He said: 'You carve from the top down as you go, if you don't follow these steps you will be starting over.

'The quality of the sand is very important - it should to be fine and have an angular grain structure.'

To preserve sculptures, he mixes water-based glue with water and sprays it on top of the sculpture.

The sand sculptures can stand for up to four months when coated with the mixture - and even withstood a hurricane.

Mr Long said: 'I put 13 gallons of fixative onto our 16ft, 65 ton sand sculpture, and Hurricane Irene didn't touch it. It stood the entire rainfall.'

But the beautiful works of art eventually disappear over time, and he says that he cannot get attached to the sculptures.

The sculptor said: 'When I first started, it was far more difficult to let go of a sculpture, but I guess you just get used to it.

'The art of sculpting sand is a very temporal form - I think what you're attached to is the performance of the work.'

Mr Long will be sculpting at Comic-con in New York this year, and will be participating in a contest in November in Siesta Key, Florida.
