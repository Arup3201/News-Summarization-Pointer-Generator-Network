A mother who allegedly dumped her baby boy in a trash can three years ago has been convicted of unlawful imprisonment after jurors failed to reach a verdict on a more serious charge of kidnapping.

Elizabeth Johnson, 26, suffocated her eight-month-old son Gabriel, put his body in a diaper bag and threw it in a dumpster in 2009, according to the boy's father.

Last month, Logan 
McQueary testified in the Texas court that Ms Johnson told him 
in phone calls and text messages what she had done to their son.

Authorities said Ms Johnson later 
recanted and told police she gave the baby to a couple at a San Antonio 
park but she never divulged the couple's identities.

It's
unclear whether Gabriel, who would have turned three in April, is still
alive. San Antonio police searched a landfill for him, but his body was
never found, which is why Ms Johnson was charged with kidnapping rather
than murder.

The Maricopa County jury deliberated 
for a day-and-a-half before returning the verdict today against 
Elizabeth Johnson, 26, in the December 2009 disappearance of Gabriel.

The
young woman, who was wearing a striped shirt and dark blazer with her 
long, brown hair in a ponytail, shifted in her chair but showed little emotion when the verdict was read out.

Aggravating circumstances: The court hearing continued after the verdicts to determine whether aggravating circumstances could make Ms Johnson's punishment more severe

No verdict: Jurors failed to reach a verdict on the most serious charge against the young mother, kidnapping

The jury also found Ms Johnson guilty of custodial interference and conspiracy to commit custodial interference.

Both charges carry a maximum penalty of 3.75 years in prison while 
unlawful imprisonment carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison.

Ms
Johnson, who has been in jail since her December 30, 2009, arrest could
walk away with time served or face a prison term as much as nine and a 
half years when sentenced on November 1.

The court hearing continued after the
verdicts were read, to determine whether there were aggravating 
circumstances that could make Johnson's punishment more severe.

She had originally faced up to 27 years in prison if convicted of kidnapping and the other charges.
Ms Johnson was initially found mentally unfit to stand trial but later was cleared to proceed.

Loss: At the time of his disappearance, Ms Johnson was discussing putting Gabriel up for adoption

Fallout: Mr McQueary, pictured, testified how the relationship quickly broke down after the birth of Gabriel in 2009

In closing arguments, prosecutor Angela Andrews said Ms Johnson used Gabriel as a pawn in her disputes with Mr McQueary.

The prosecutor alleged Ms Johnson ran
off to another state with the child to get back at Mr McQueary after he
ended their tumultuous relationship. The boy's father isn't suspected 
in the child's disappearance.

Ms Johnson's attorney, Marc Victor, 
presented no defense witnesses at trial. He had said the jury likely 
would convict Johnson on the custodial interference charge because she 
violated a judge's custody order. But he argued prosecutors otherwise failed to prove his client's guilt.

Mr Victor described Ms Johnson as an 
unsophisticated single mother who was under a lot of stress, was in a 
volatile relationship with the boy's father, and was being manipulated 
by a woman who wanted to adopt Gabriel.

Investigators said Ms Johnson brought
the child from Tempe to Texas, stayed for a week and then took a bus to
Florida without him.

Heartbreak: Logan McQueary testified against his former girlfriend, claiming she told him she had killed their eight-month-old son, Gabriel, and thrown his body into a dumpster

Ms Johnson had been fighting with Mr 
McQueary about whether to give up Gabriel for adoption. She signed over 
temporary guardianship of the boy to a Scottsdale couple for about 10 
days before she picked him up and left Arizona.

The would-be adoptive mother from 
Scottsdale, Tammi Peters Smith, was accused of lying on a court document
about the child's possible paternity in an effort to keep Gabriel from 
his father. Ms Smith was convicted of forgery and conspiracy to commit 
custodial interference.

Testifying on September 24, the boy's father said 
told jurors Ms Johnson, with whom he had broken up, allegedly admitted 
that she just killed Gabriel after driving him to San Antonio.

'I remember asking her over and over 
again where she was at,' McQueary said. 'She told me that she killed 
Gabriel. She said, "You made me. You made me kill my baby boy".'

Speaking outside the court, he added to CBS5 that he has not given up hope his son is still alive.

Charged: Gabriel's body has never been found so Elizabeth Johnson, pictured in court, was charged with kidnapping

Struggle: Ms Johnson allegedly texted Mr McQueary to say that their break-up had pushed her to kill their baby son

'It's a slight possibility,' he said. 'It's hard to believe it sometimes when you read the reports and all the investigation.'

He added that he was hopeful that his former girlfriend would one day tell the truth.

'I am hoping that someday she will,' 
Mr McQueary said. 'She's given a lot of different stories and everything is
inconsistent, so its hard to believe anything she says, really.'

Mr McQueary stuck
to the story he has told before in his testimony. It is an account he 
also told earlier this year during the trial of Tammi Smith.

He detailed their rocky relationship and how they started dating in 2007 after Ms Johnson's brother moved in with Mr McQueary. She fell pregnant months later, the Arizona Republic reported.

But
after the birth of the baby boy in 2009, their relationship 
deteriorated. On December 8, 2009, he moved out of their shared trailer 
home in Tempe and took the baby with him - at Ms Johnson's request.

Innocent: Mr Johnson told Mr McQueary she wanted him to sign for the baby to be adopted, but he refused

The next day, Ms Johnson called him and 
asked for him to sign for their son to be adopted by Ms Smith, who 
she had met weeks prior.

'I told her I wanted to be part of Gabriel's life,' Mr McQueary said. 'I didn't want to put him up for adoption.'

But she told him he was never going to see Gabriel again, he said.

He filed for custody and was awarded shared custody later that month. Ms Johnson was meant to hand over Gabriel to him on December 20, but she never showed up.

On December 28, 2009, he said Ms Johnson sent him a text saying she had killed Gabriel. When he called her, she added: 'You made me kill my baby boy.'

'I just kept saying, no you didn't,' he told the court.

Becoming increasingly suspicious of her, he recorded the phone calls and took them to the police. By the time they arrested Johnson in Miami, Gabriel was gone - and has never been found.
