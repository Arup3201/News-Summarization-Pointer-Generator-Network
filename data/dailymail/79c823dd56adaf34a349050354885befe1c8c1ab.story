Scot Young, pictured with former girlfriend Noelle Reno, left an NHS mental health facility hours before he fell to his death from a flat

Doctors face an inquiry into the death of tycoon Scot Young after it emerged he left an NHS mental health facility just hours before he fell 60ft from a flat.

Mr Young, 52, who was involved in one of Britain’s most notorious divorce cases, landed on metal railings outside a £3million apartment earlier this month.

It has emerged that he had admitted himself to the NHS Gordon Hospital in central London on December 5.

The facility specialises in treating the most severe mental health problems and its website says it only admits patients who are ‘in an acute phase of a serious mental illness’.

But Mr Young walked out on December 8 and was dead hours later, after showing up at his ex-girlfriend’s apartment and warning he was going to jump.

Health workers were obliged to contact him within 24 hours for a check-up, but he was dead by the time they called.

Doctors were accused of failing Mr Young, who had twice previously been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and was taking prescription medication for bipolar disorder.

His family is furious that he was allowed to leave the facility when he was apparently acting ‘manic’ and ‘crazy’. But as Mr Young had not been sectioned, hospital staff could not force him to stay. The NHS has begun an investigation to find out why he was discharged.

James Creed, one of Mr Young’s closest friends, said: ‘He was in a mental home. He was in the same place two years ago, it’s a horrible place. He called me when he was there, every day. Then he called me on the Monday and said he was coming out. I don’t know why.’

Mr Young, a former fixer to the super rich, was found impaled on railings outside a flat in Montagu Square, Marylebone. He was one of Britain’s wealthiest men, with a fortune of up to £2billion, luxury properties in Surrey, Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Miami, a collection of supercars and a private jet.

But he became embroiled in one of the most high profile divorces ever seen in the UK, with former wife Michelle, 50, accusing him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters. He claimed he had lost all his money in a Russian property deal but she demanded £300million, saying he was worth ‘a few billion’.

The businessman, a friend of Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green and late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, was last November ordered to pay her £20million, plus £6million in legal costs. He was also jailed for refusing to reveal how much money he was worth.

After his release, Mr Young became engaged to 31-year-old American fashion designer and TV presenter Noelle Reno. She was a star of the Bravo reality show Ladies of London.

But he was apparently drinking heavily and using cocaine, and she split up with him a few months ago. When Miss Reno arrived home on December 8, she found him inside apparently ‘manic, crazy and probably high’ and she demanded he leave, friends said. She allegedly walked out and called the police to remove him, while he phoned her, saying he was going to jump out of the window. By the time police arrived, he was dead.

Mr Young previously claimed he had been followed by private detectives hired by his ex-wife.

‘In the condition I am in, paranoia can manifest in many ways, especially when you have eight people following you,’ he said. ‘I spent 14 days in hospital under the Mental Health Act … It was not a nice experience.’

Police insist Mr Young’s death is not being treated as suspicious but there has been much speculation, including claims he was linked to the notorious Adams crime family. Friends also claimed he was targeted by Russian mafia who had previously dangled him out of a window at the Dorchester Hotel, Park Lane.

One said he was the fifth member of a ‘ring of death’ – five friends who have died in unusual circumstances in recent years – including TV star Trinny Woodall’s ex-husband Johnny Elichaoff, millionaire property tycoon Robert Curtis, who dated model Caprice, entrepreneur Paul Castle and Mr Berezovsky.

An inquest into Mr Young’s death was adjourned on Tuesday and will resume next month.

A spokesman for Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘We are also investigating his care and his mutually agreed discharge from the ward to home.’

The Russian exile who fled for Britain fearing for his life

Oligarch Boris Berezovsky was found dead in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March last year – after fleeing Russia fearing for his life.

The 67-year-old businessman amassed a huge fortune after the Soviet Union collapsed and state assets were privatised.

But after a high profile falling out with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he was granted political asylum in the UK in 2003.

During his life, Mr Berezovsky survived many assassination attempts, including a bomb which decapitated his chauffeur.

In 2012, he lost a £3 billion damages claim against Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich in 2012, after which he told family members he feared he had been poisoned.

Mr Berezovsky was also one of the investors who, alongside Scot Young, lost a lot of money in a mysterious property deal in Russia named ‘Project Moscow’.

In March, he was found hanged by a scarf and police investigated possible foul play. It was later declared that there had been no sign of a struggle – even though an expert speaking at the inquest into his death said he could not have killed himself.

Professor Bernd Brinkmann, who deals with hanging and asphyxiation cases, claimed the marks on the oligarch’s neck indicated he had been killed.

Mr Berezovsky was more likely to have been strangled by someone else and then hanged from the shower rail in the bathroom, he said.

His daughter Elizaveta Berezovskaya told the inquest she feared he was assassinated for warning that Mr Putin was a ‘danger to the world’.

Trinny’s Woodall's ex who friends 'cannot comprehend' would kill himself 

Financial adviser Johnny Elichaoff, who used to be married to TV presenter Trinny Woodall, died last month after falling from the roof of a London shopping centre.

The 55-year-old was a drummer and managed rock bands such as Fairground Attraction before getting involved in business.

He became friendly with Scot Young through his work as a financial advisor but had also hit hard times – first divorcing his TV presenter wife in 2009, before more recently being forced to sell his businesses.

Just weeks before his death at Whiteleys shopping centre in west London, he had been talked down from the same roof.

Friends said they were devastated, but could not comprehend that he would have wanted to take his own life.

The tycoon who dated Caprice but lost it all and fell under Tube train

Millionaire property tycoon Robert Curtis is another friend of Young’s who was killed in recent years.

The 47-year-old businessman, who used to date model Caprice, died after being hit by a train in North West London two years ago.

He had made his money in the 2000s alongside Mr Young in the London property market and was known for his lavish lifestyle, expensive cars and designer wardrobe.

At the height of his success, he was the director of 15 firms and worked from an office in upmarket St John’s Wood, near Lord’s cricket ground, while being chauffeured in a Rolls Royce with a personalised number plate.

The money suddenly dried up in recent years, though, and he faced huge debts. All but one of his companies folded.

Before his death, the father-of-one had moved out of home and was living in a Travelodge hotel in Whetstone, North London.

He had £25 cash in his pocket when he was killed by a southbound Jubilee Line train at Kingsbury station in North West London.

The polo fan who played with Prince Charles and died near his London office

Entrepreneur Paul Castle also died after being hit by a Tube train.

The tycoon, 54, had come from little money and had few qualifications but managed to make a fortune in property and flew between homes in the UK, France and Switzerland in his private plane.

Mixing with elite crowds, he boasted of playing polo with Prince Charles and was photographed shaking hands with the Queen after the match.

The father-of-two had been married three times and was due to marry his fourth wife but was apparently hit badly by the recession.

Mr Castle, who is said to have socialised with Mr Young at London’s exclusive Cipriani restaurant, was killed in 2010.

He was found under a carriage at Bond Street, near his London office. 

The lawyer who foresaw his death days before fatal helicopter crash

High-flying lawyer Stephen Curtis was killed in a mysterious helicopter crash near Bournemouth in 2004.

Mr Curtis, said to have been worth £100million, told a friend just a week before he died: 'If anything happens to me in the next few weeks, it will not be an accident.'

Scotland Yard said there were no suspicious circumstances at the time and referred the deaths of Mr Curtis and pilot Max Radford, 34, to a coroner, who ruled he lost his bearings in torrid weather.

But the family of Mr Radford say Russian oligarchs were behind the crash which killed the pair.

Mr Radford's mother, Gloria, 72, said: 'It was no pilot error - that is balderdash.' 

Father-of-one Mr Curtis, 45, is said to have lost much of his fortune after investing in Project Moscow.
