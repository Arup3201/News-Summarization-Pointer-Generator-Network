A security expert claims to have uncovered a major flaw in the traffic system in in major cities around the world including London and New York.

Cesar Cerrudo, an Argentinian security researcher with IoActive, says he can control traffic lights and even reroute traffic.

He discovered is was possible to control the sensors embedded into the road and used by control systems to monitor traffic.

The Argentinian security expert claims to have uncovered a major flaw in the traffic system in in major cities around the world including London and New York.

Sensys has 250+ customers in 45 US states and 10 countriesImportant US cities have deployments: New York, Washington DC, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle, etc.50,000+ devices deployed worldwide (most of them in the US)Countries include US, United Kingdom, China, Canada, Australia, France, etc. For instance, some UK cities with deployments: London, Shropshire, Slough, Bournemouth, Aberdeen, Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council, Belfast, etc. Australia has a big deployment on one of the most important and modern freeways.

He was able to take control of the sensors –Sensys Networks VDS240 wireless vehicle detection systems– which are installed in 40 U.S. cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, DC, as well as in nine other countries.

The system is comprised of magnetic sensors embedded in roadways that wirelessly collect data.

MailOnline contacted Sensys, but it did not respond to requests.

Cerrudo saiys he was inspired by the movie Die Hard, which sees hackers contolling a city's traffic.

'Probably many of you have watched scenes from 'Live Free or Die Hard' (Die Hard 4) where 'terrorist hackers' manipulate traffic signals by just hitting Enter or typing a few keys,' he wrote in a blog post revealing the hack.

'I wanted to do that! I started to look around, and while I couldn't exactly do the same thing (too Hollywood style!), I got pretty close.

'By exploiting the vulnerabilities I found, an attacker could cause traffic jams and problems at intersections, freeways, highways.'

Cerrudo said that once he bought a sensor for himself, he found it was relatively easy to control.

'After getting the devices, it wasn't difficult to find vulnerabilities.

'The vulnerabilities I found allow anyone to take complete control of the devices and send fake data to traffic control systems.

'Basically anyone could cause a traffic mess by launching an attack with a simple exploit programmed on cheap hardware ($100 or less).

'I even tested the attack launched from a drone flying at over 650 feet, and it worked!'

Cerrudo said he even let the firm that makes the sensors know.

'What I would like to mention is that the vendor was contacted a long time ago (September 2013) through ICS-CERT (the initial report to ICS-CERT was sent on July 31st, 2013). I was told by ICS-CERT that the vendor said that they didn't think the issues were critical nor even important.

'Another excuse the vendor provided is that because the devices don't control traffic lights, there is no need for security.

'This is crazy, because while the devices don't directly control traffic control systems, they have a direct influence on the actions and decisions of these systems.'

He says he will now reveal details of the hack at a conference next month after the firm failed to address the problem.

'This should be another wake up call for governments to evaluate the security of devices/products before using them in critical infrastructure, and also a request to providers of government devices/products to take security and security vulnerability reports seriously,' he said.

'By exploiting the vulnerabilities I found, an attacker could cause traffic jams and problems at intersections, freeways, highways, etc.

'It’s also possible to cause electronic signs to display incorrect speed limits and instructions and to make ramp meters allow cars on the freeway faster or slower than needed.

'These traffic problems could cause real issues, even deadly ones, by causing accidents or blocking ambulances, fire fighters, or police cars going to an emergency call.'
