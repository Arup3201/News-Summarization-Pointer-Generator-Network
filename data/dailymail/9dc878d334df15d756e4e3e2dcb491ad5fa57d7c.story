It's been a dismal start to the Australian snow season this year as snow slopes have been uninvitingly bare and brown.

While it's usual for snow fall to be infrequent this early in the season, temperatures have been too warm for snow machines to be brought out by ski resorts.

And it doesn't look very promising as snow forecaster Peter Taylor says it's going to be an average season.

Despite the slow start to the snow season due to warm weather, families enjoyed Thredbo Ski Resort's opening weekend celebrations

One snow gun was used at Thredbo on Friday night

Mr Taylor, the operator of snowatch.com.au, said this hasn't been a good start to the season which officially begun on Friday.

'It's been very slow,' he said.

'But there usually isn't enough snow at the start of the season. 

'Although warmer temperatures meant that snow machines couldn't be used until last night.

'They usually bring out the snow guns two weeks prior but it was too warm to do that this year.'

This was the case at Thredbo as their spokeswoman Susie Diver confirmed they only brought out their snow guns last night.

Snow forecaster Peter Taylor predicts it will be another average year for snowfall this year

Mr Taylor also believes it will be a slow start to the snow season this year. Pictured is an Australian ski resort, Thredbo, on Friday

'But the temperatures dropping now and we’re expecting to see a few centimetres of snow tonight,' Mr Taylor said.

He predicts that the snow season will be 'average' this year but it'll certainly be better than the last.

'Thankfully season 2013 is well and truly behind us as it was one of the worst seasons on record,' he said.

'And because of the El Nino patterns, we're less likely to get a good season this time round but it'll definitely be better than last year.'

Thredbo’s spokeswoman Susie Diver said there probably won’t be enough snow for skiing and snow boarding this long weekend.

‘But we can't be too sure as it's very unpredictable,' she said.

Despite the minimal snowfall, Thredbo are gearing up for the Queen's Birthday long weekend.
