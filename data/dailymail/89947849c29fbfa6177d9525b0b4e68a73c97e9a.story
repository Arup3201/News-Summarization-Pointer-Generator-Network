A bizarre photograph of a goose taped to a boot of a vehicle has emerged online.

The photograph, posted by Sina Weibo on China Smack on Thursday, shows a brown box with a goose popping out of it taped to the trunk of a silver sedan.

It's understood the owner of the car was heading home ahead of the Chinese New Year, which starts on Thursday, while driving at a speed of  100 km/h in China.

A caption along the photograph said: 'The owner of this car, when you’re driving at speed up to 100 km/h, have you considered how this goose would feel? When going home for Chinese New Year, have a safe journey!'

The photograph has attracted a significant amount of comments in response to 'how this goose would feel'.

One person wrote: 'Hey hey hey! I’m just a goose. Are you trying to get to the moon driving this fast?!!!'

Mighty joked: 'He should tie a cat and pretend he's driving a Jaguar.' and in response, Kai said: 'LoL, probably have to switch it from the trunk to the hood though.'

Biggj wrote: 'That's a pretty good idea.'
