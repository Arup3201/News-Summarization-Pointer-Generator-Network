Olympic under-performers British Swimming have been left paying the price for their miserable Games after seeing their funding from UK Sport severely slashed.

Swimming was the major casualty in Tuesday's funding announcement for the four years leading up to Rio 2016 after it returned just three medals at London 2012.

There was good news for athletics, 
cycling, rowing, boxing and gymnastics from the record £347million 
total but there were reductions for volleyball and archery, while backing for basketball
and handball was cut altogether.

Slashed: Rebecca Adlington won two bronze medals at London 2012 but it didn't prevent UK Sport cutting funding by £4m.

With Rebecca Adlington picking up two bronze medals and Michael Jamieson one silver, bosses at British Swimming had been braced for the bade news.

David Sparkes, British Swimming CEO, said: 'Overall we are satisfied with the outcome. While disappointed with the award for swimming, we recognise we need to rebuild confidence that we can deliver medals at Olympic level consistently before we can demand more investment.

'We had a disappointing Olympics in swimming and we now need to focus our energies on driving the cultural change needed moving forward and this will be built around a no compromise approach underpinned by performance management and strong effective leadership.

'Everyone involved in swimming remains committed to working hard towards achieving success in Rio and beyond.'

Despite the cuts, British Swimming saw an increase in funding for four other aquatic sports - disability swimming, diving, synchro and women's water polo.

'We are delighted to see increased investment in disability swimming and diving which is richly deserved although there remains still much to do in these areas before Rio,' said Sparkes.

'The funding of women's water polo and synchronised swimming is welcomed as clearly UK Sport recognises the tremendous progress these two sports have made in the last four-to-five years.'

Team GB did better on the athletics track than expected, with the highlights including gold medal performances from Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford, and this has been reflected in their funding.

Golden: Mo Farah won two gold medals at London 2012.

What a lass: Jessica Ennis won gold in the Heptathlon.

Joy: Greg Rutherford took a gold medal in the mens long jump.

UKA Performance Director, Neil Black, said: 'We're very pleased to receive the increased levels of support across both Olympic and Paralympic performance programmes.

'The investment in athletics reflects the progress made over the last four years and demonstrates confidence in our plans for the next Games cycle.'

UKA Paralympic head coach, Paula Dunn, added: 'Funding from UK Sport and the National Lottery was an integral part of our success in London this summer and we are absolutely delighted to be receiving an increased investment of 59 per cent into the Paralympic programme.'

Di Ellis, Chair of British Rowing, said: 'The GB Rowing Team would not be where it is today without the backing and support we have received from UK Sport and the National Lottery.'

There was also a welcome from sailing, with RYA Performance Director John Derbyshire saying of the increase from £22,942,700 for London: 'Sailing's Olympic award is broadly welcomed and will enable us to start implementing our plans for the Rio cycle, off the back of having successfully delivered another five medals at the Olympic Games this summer to remain one of Great Britain's most consistently high-performing Olympic sports.

'We're grateful to UK Sport for their continued confidence in the RYA's World Class Programme, and look forward to the clarity and opportunity that these awards now provide us with in our planning for Rio 2016 and 2020.'

Hero: Britain's legendary sailor Ben Ainslie won his fourth gold medal at London 2012 to help secure an additional 6.1% funding for his sport.

Winners: Katherine Copeland and Sophie Hosking claimed gold in the Lightweight Women's Double Sculls in London and their funding has been increased from £27.3m to £32.6m

Disappointment: GB beach volleyball stars Zara Dampney and Shauna Mullin seen competing at the London games but they are unlikely to be in Rio in four years.

Losers: Handball lost all funding causing Great Britain handball player Chris McDermott to tweet in anger

Sad: GB volleyball star Maria Bertelli has tweeted her dismay at the decision
