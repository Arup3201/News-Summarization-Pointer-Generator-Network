From wonderfully detailed portraits to striking Marimekko style designs, artist Yulia Brodskaya's work might look like the result of careful work with a paintbrush but in this instance, appearances are deceptive.

Instead, Brodskaya's intricate creations are made using a technique called 'quilling', which involves using strips of paper that have been rolled and then twisted into shape.

'It takes a couple of days to make the simple designs and a few weeks for more elaborate and complicated pieces such as the portraits,' reveals the Russian artist.

Incredible: Yulia's wonderful work looks like was created with oil paint rather than strips of paper

With a background in origami and a degree in graphic communication, quilling wasn't in Brodskaya's early plans but she says that when she finally discovered it, it was love at first try.

'I started to use it about five years ago,' she explains. 'I was planning to create a small brochure with my hand-drawn illustrations to be sent out to potential clients and I was looking for an eye-catching image with my name (Yulia) for the cover.

'I created a number of hand-drawn variants, but I didn’t like any of them and then I remembered an image from some school book showing a paper strips standing on edge and tried to make the letters using this technique.

'The attempt was successful and over the next couple months I switched to quilling completely.'

Quilling itself dates back to the Renaissance when it was used by monks and nuns in France and Italy to decorate book covers.

Later, it became popular as a hobby during the 18th century, when it was considered an appropriate pastime for gentlewomen.

After years in decline, the art form resurfaced in the 1980s when quilling became hugely popular with enthusiastic children in search of a hobby.

'My mum got interested in quilling after seeing my work so now she practices it as a hobby and makes presents for friends,' adds Yulia.

While few laymen will manage to hit the heights achieved by Yulia, she does have some tips for those who would like to take up the craft. 

'There are lots of lessons on Youtube 
and you can buy ready to go quilling kits and tools,' she suggests.

'The main thing is 
to have lot's of patience since it is a quite slow and time-consuming 
craft but I believe the result is worth it.'
