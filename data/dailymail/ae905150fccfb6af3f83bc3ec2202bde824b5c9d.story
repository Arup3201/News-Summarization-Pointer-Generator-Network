Charged: Yadina Morales is accused of manslaughter after her baby suffocated

A drunk mother killed her two-month-old daughter at her Maryland home on Saturday morning after passing out while breastfeeding.

When the baby's father, Dwayne Bryant, tried to wake his girlfriend, Yadina Morales, he found the lifeless body of his daughter trapped under her.

The 22-year-old woman, who has been charged with manslaughter, 
was apparently so drunk she didn't even realize her child had been rushed to hospital, police said. 

'We found that the mother was highly 
intoxicated and had actually been breastfeeding the child and passed out
 and ultimately smothered the child,' Sheriff Douglas Mullendore told NBC Washington.

The
 baby was rushed to hospital but it was too late to save her. A post-mortem 
examination is now due to be carried out in Baltimore.

According to court records, 
the baby's father, Mr Bryant, called emergency services who found him 
screaming in the car park of the couple's home, Business Insider reported.

'She had no idea what was going on. She 
didn't even know EMS had been there and took her child to the hospital,'
 a police deputy said in court documents.

A blood test found Morales, who has two other children, was three times over the legal drink-drive limit.

Her boyfriend told police she had been drinking vodka just before the baby started crying.

Nursing mothers are advised to not drink while breastfeeding because the level of alcohol in breast milk and the mother's blood is the same.

Women are also advised against falling asleep next to newborns because of the risk of suffocation.
