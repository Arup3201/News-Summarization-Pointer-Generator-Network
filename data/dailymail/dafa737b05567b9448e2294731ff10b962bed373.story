A postwoman left a cancer-stricken elderly man and his wife without their post for two weeks - because she refused to duck under their handing baskets to deliver it for them. 

Peter and Hazel Kelly, from Woburn Sands, Buckinghamshire, missed out on bank statements, an invitation and a letter from the hospital, all because the postwoman said it hurt her back to avoid the two large hanging baskets.

Until now they had received nothing but praise for their annual floral display, with photographs being used on calendars and postcards.

Peter Kelly said that his local postman will no longer deliver mail to his house because of the hanging baskets

Not all roses round the door: Peter and Hazel Kelly complained after missing out on two weeks of post

Mrs Kelly, 76, said the gardening helps her 75-year-old husband -  who is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, having been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

She said: 'We couldn't understand why we hadn't any post for two weeks. My husband was outside the front tidying up and saw the postwoman. He said: "Good morning my duck, we haven't had any letters for a while" and she said "No I am not delivering to you no more".

'She said it was damaging her back to get to the front door. They are tied in place securely at the front of the porch and if it was that much of a problem for her to get past she could have put them on the mat. 

'We have always had big hanging baskets there and the postman and the postwoman we had before did not complain.'

Bloomin' heck! The postwoman refused to deliver to the couple because their hanging baskets 'hurt her back' 

Beautiful display: The elderly couple had only ever received praise for the floral displays before

The colourful baskets are full of trailing begonias and geraniums. and have always attracted a lot of attention. 

'Until now we have had nothing but compliments about our hanging baskets and garden. People say it is a little ray of sunshine,' said Mrs Kelly - who has four children, 12 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

'We have been doing the baskets for 30 years. A couple who had just got married knocked on the door and asked if they could have their pictures taken and one Chinese lady was so taken with our garden she bought 60 postcards of Woburn Sands to send as Christmas cards.

'We do the garden and baskets together and it helps my husband who has been going through a very hard time with his chemo.'

It's not difficult! Mr Kelly, 75, who is undergoing chemotherapy, says he has no trouble getting to the front door

Mr Kelly, who was disabled while serving in the army, added: 'We're in our late 70s and duck, so I can't see why she can't do it. We have had bigger baskets than that in the past. The previous post lady used to just walk through.' 

The couple contacted the JVS consumer programme on Three Counties Radio. As a result, Royal Mail sent a Health and Safety investigator to the cottage and the deliveries have now been resumed. 

Royal Mail spokeswoman Felicity MacFarlane said: 'We'd like to apologise to Mr Kelly for his recent concerns over his mail delivery.

'There has been no formal delivery suspension but our postwoman has experienced difficulty on recent occasions delivering the mail.

'Mr Kelly's mail has been delivered to him today and Royal Mail is discussing the matter with the customer.'
