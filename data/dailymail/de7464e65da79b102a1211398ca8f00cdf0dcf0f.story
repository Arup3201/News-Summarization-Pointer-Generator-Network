A circus acrobat who starred in Britain’s Got Talent lost his 'Wheel of Death' stunt act after a disgruntled nephew stole it and sold it for scrap, a court heard today.

Wayne Vanderwesthuizen, 46, was planning to use the machine after he got through to the second round of the ITV talent show.

But it went missing from storage in Blackpool, Lancashire, after a row with his nephew Jeremy, 26, over £3,500 unpaid wages, it was said.

Jeremy took the 'Wheel of Death' machine to the scrap yard - selling it for just £585 then sold his uncle’s Ford van on eBay to a man in London for £2,500, the court heard.

It emerged Wayne had originally paid £3,000 for the act but then added to it adapting it through the years, spending a further £3,500.

The fallout occurred last November after South African-born Wayne employed Jeremy to help run his circus act in which three acrobats walk, skip and jump on a set of triple revolving wheels whilst blindfolded.

Preston Crown Court heard Wayne spent his winters in South Africa and summers touring around England attending agricultural shows, outdoor shows and festivals with his death-defying act.

The Wheel of Death is a steel construction of two or three wheels connected by spokes which revolve at high speeds

He would occasionally get bookings over New Year and Christmas and Jeremy was paid per event but during 2010 business began to slump and Wayne fell behind paying wages.

Wayne told the jury: 'I have been doing it since 1984. Jeremy is my sister’s son. I brought him over in 2005, I trained him up with the hope eventually, one day, he would take over from me.

'I was hoping to keep it in the family, I was hoping to pass it to the next generation.

'I paid him £250 for each performing day and he took care of his own tax situation.

'In the recession, in 2009, bookings were hard to come by and I was struggling a bit, I was in some debt in South Africa as well.

Wayne Vanderwesthuizen bought the Wheel of Death in 1984 and has been touring with it ever since

'I asked if I could pay him back at a later stage.

'2010 was worse: I went to work in a traveling circus in Israel because there were no bookings. In 2011 he worked with me from April 25 to July 9. I terminated it (his contract).

'A booking on a triple wheel came up, there was a guy I was using that he didn’t like - but there was a contract. I told him it doesn’t matter whether you like him or not, I need to make sure I fulfil the contract.

'He eventually did agree but (he) said only if he could work the rest of the season and I said as long as you are clean-shaven, but he refused.'

Wayne returned to South Africa in the second week of September last year, putting his van and equipment into storage in Blackpool, whilst Jeremy remained in England.

Jeremy Vanderwesthuizen denies two charges of theft in relation to the disappearance of the Wheel of Death

Wayne Vanderwesthuizen said that the recession led to a decline in bookings for the Wheel of Death

He said he had been in touch with the man managing the storage to say they would be back in the beginning of the New Year to practice because they had gone through to the second round of Britain’s Got Talent.

Wayne said he bought the van in July 2011 for £2,750 and had bought the Wheel of Death in 1987. He said the only communication he had with Jeremy since last July was an email saying that he would clear the debts with any bookings he got, which included the Abu Dhabi Grand prix.

Wayne said he had already repaid his nephew £1,100, through £100 pay outs and still owed him £1,300. He has since bought another Wheel of Death from Holland at £5,500 and was still paying it off.

The truck has been returned to him after police tracked it down a short time afterwards.

Jeremy denies two charges of theft. Paul Hague prosecuting said: 'He accepted that he took it but he felt like he was entitled to do so because he had no money.'

'The question is his honesty. He says he was entitled to do so, or he believed he was entitled to do so - the crown say he told lies that he must’ve known that he was not entitled to scrap this piece of equipment or sell the van to some innocent third party down in London.'

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
