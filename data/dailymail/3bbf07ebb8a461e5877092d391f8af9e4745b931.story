Convicted: Glamour model Katherine Nwaiwu, 28, has blamed 'pre-menstrual syndrome' for launching a violent attack against her husband and the manager of an exclusive central London hotel

A glamour model has blamed 'pre-menstrual syndrome' for launching a violent attack against her husband and the manager of an exclusive central London hotel.

Katherine Nwaiwu, 28, flew into a rage during a row with her husband at the Kensington Close Hotel in west London.

A court heard Nwaiwu - also known as Katrina Wild - violently grabbed and kicked her husband and pushed the hotel manager who tried to intervene.

The meltdown - described by a judge as 'thoroughly anti-social' was so
 bad fellow guests called the police.

The model, who has posed for magazines including Fiesta, Knave and Escort, 
pleaded guilty yesterday to assaulting husband Chukwudi Nwaiwu and hotel manager Boris
 Vasquez-Gallo, by beating.

The court heard first-time offender 
Nwaiwu, who makes £25,000 a year from her modelling work, blamed 
pre-menstrual syndrome for her behaviour.

In response to that, deputy district judge Mr. Timothy Godfrey said: 'I take that into account, but it is no excuse.'

Nwaiwu only pleaded guilty to the 
charges after viewing CCTV evidence, which showed her violently grabbing
 her husband and pushing the manager in the corridor.

Prosecutor
 Mr Vijay Khuttan told the court the defendant also aimed 'kicks' at 
her husband, who she became angry with when he told her: 'I'm leaving,' 
during a row.

'As the 
husband was leaving the hotel she assaulted him and pushed the manager 
in the process of trying to get to the fire escape,' he said.

'It
 is a push to the shoulder against the fire exit door, there is no great
 force as she was trying to push him out of the way, but he had some 
bruising, which was pointed out by someone else.'

Sentencing her, Mr Godfrey added: 'You did behave in a thoroughly anti-social way that was serious enough to upset other hotel guests that did complain.

'This stemmed from you losing your temper with your husband in your room and you did assault him and the manager, who was only doing his job.'

Nwaiwu, of Malmesbury, Wiltshire, was conditionally discharged for 
twelve months at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court and ordered to pay £400 
costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

No orders were made for compensation following the incident on January 24.

A charge of assaulting one of the police officers who arrived was dropped.
