It may be the first official day of Spring, but it would be wise not to pack away the scarves and gloves just yet. 

Forecasters predict a colder-than-average March, with parts of north-west England and Wales expected to wake up to at least 2in of snow tomorrow.

According to long range forecasts, the cold snap is expected to last throughout March and will see Britain covered in more snow and frost.

Then April will bring in a long-awaited warm and sunny Easter, where temperatures could peak at an above-average 21C (70F).

However despite it being the first official day of Spring today and much of the UK enjoying fine weather, this is not expected to last past the evening.

Much of Britain woke up to sunshine and temperatures of around 10C (50F) today after a break from the cold snap and a relatively mild weekend.  

But the mercury is expected to plunge to below freezing tonight and tomorrow evening, with around 2.4in of snow forecast to fall in western Britain.

Around 4in of snow may fall over the Pennines and the Scottish Highlands on land above 1,300ft (400 metres).

Temperatures will be slightly below average for this time of year, dipping to zero tonight and -1C (30F) tomorrow evening. 

Chris Page, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'This week will be cold with sunny spells and some wintry showers.

'These showers will see snow fall on the hills in the north of the country. 

'Temperatures this week will get a little bit colder and will certainly feel cooler because of the blustery winds.' 

The Met Office has issued a weather warning for this evening, with heavy rain expected to fall and turn into wintry showers and ice by the morning.

Snowy conditions are forecast in the north of the UK on Monday and Tuesday, giving way to showers by Wednesday as cold weather continues

Two lambs were born in Shugborough Hall this week and are pictured with Melissa Underwood-Grattage - a sign of the start of Spring. But the cold temperatures are not over yet - with snow and sleet forecast for this week and the cold weather expected to last throughout March

Cold westerly winds from Canada will bring sleet, snow and hail overnight this evening. The mercury is expected to hover at around 5C to 7C this week - considerably colder than the highs of 10C and sunny conditions seen this weekend that saw snow melt on the Derwent Dam in the Peak District.

Mr Page added: 'The cold air is pushing in from the North, and temperatures are likely to drop down to zero overnight for the next few days and there is some potential for icy patches.' 

The cold weather this week comes as Spring officially began today. 

Two lambs were born this week at at Shugborough Hall estate near Stafford, the first of around 100 lambs and goat kids that are expected to be born throughout Spring. 

Crocuses have also sprung up in the eight-acre field of the village of Inkpen in Berkshire - another sign of the changing of the seasons this week. 

But the newborn lambs are unlikely to see this season getting warmer yet as cold conditions continue throughout March, which is forecast to be drier in the second half of the month but with colder nights and frost.

However, by Easter Sunday on April 5 the mercury is expected to reach 21C - around 8C above average for the time of year. This is likely to be caused by a build-up of higher pressure that will bring warmer and more settled conditions.

And May could be even warmer, with temperatures of up to 27C, according to British Weather Services. The warmer than average weather is leading to hopes that Britain could be on course for a hot dry summer.
