The oldest runner in this year’s London Marathon has vowed to carry on competing for another two years until his 16 year-old grandson can take over from him.

Paul Freedman, 89, only started running when he was 61 but now has 170 marathons under his belt. This Sunday will be the 22nd time he has taken part in the London race.

One year he ran just 12 months after a massive heart attack.

Mr Freedman, a retired retail buyer, has raised over £100,000 for charity over the years and was awarded the MBE in 2008 for his efforts.

His grandson Samuel Freedman, 16, has begged him to keep doing marathons until he turns 18 and is old enough to take over from him in the London event.

Samuel hopes his grandad will remain fit enough for them to run together in the 2016 marathon before he takes the family baton.

Mr Freedman, from Hornchurch, Essex, said: 'I took up running when I was 61 because I had been stuck in a desk job but I had always been an active person.

'It’s the crowd that pushes you round the marathon course and I crack jokes as I’m going round to keep people’s spirits up.

'Samuel has said: "Please granddad, wait until I’m 18", but I’m not sure how well I’ll hold up to be honest.

'I’m a lot more unfit than I was but I’m still determined. My breathing isn’t as good as it used to be and my mouth gets dry.

'But I still exercise each week and I’m determined to finish in under eight hours this year so I can get another medal.

'Two years is a long time away but I’m going to do all I can to make sure I get to run in a marathon with my grandson.'

Student Samuel said: 'I said to him I wanted to do just one with him. I think he’ll be well enough to do it because he walks a lot.

'He said I’ll be much fitter than him but obviously for the first one I’ll walk alongside him and I can just take in the atmosphere.

'And then I’ll be able to spur him on. I’m very proud of him. No one has a granddad like mine.'

Mr Freedman was inspired to start fundraising for the St Francis Hospice, Essex, after his wife Reene died of lung cancer in 2007.

He has dedicated an entire room in his home to all the medals and memorabilia from the races he has entered.

Mr Freedman, a dad-of-one, added: 'I had a heart attack in 2003 and was in hospital for three weeks. I wasn’t allowed to run the 2004 marathon after that which I wasn’t happy about.

'The doctors told my son I would need a pacemaker but because I was so fit I didn’t need one.

'I still go to the hospice where they cared for my wife Reene every Christmas and I put on shows for them to fundraise too.

'I will be wearing orange for the hospice and my bib will have ‘officially the oldest runner’ on it.

'When I won the MBE I told the Queen I ran the marathon every year and she said: "You run right past my house". I wanted to say "Yes, but you never wave at me.”'

Paul is hoping to raise £6,000 this year.

The oldest ever London Marathon runner was Fauja Singh, from Essex, who completed the race in 6 hours, 7 minutes at the age of 93 in 2004.
