It is meant to be a day of solemn reflection on the sacrifice paid by those who fought and died for their country.

So many of those who lined the streets of Bristol were left outraged when a man dressed as a devil chose to gatecrash a Remembrance Day march to honour the war dead.

These shocking pictures show a masked man, wearing a pink corset and stockings, skateboarding alongside the parade of marching troops in Bristol today.

The man was seen cutting in and out of the regiments after the formal ceremony had finished, during which wreaths were laid.

His behaviour was in marked contrast to elsewhere across the country, where the war dead were remembered with suitable solemnity as the Queen led the nation in honouring the fallen with the Duke of Cambridge joining her at the Cenotaph.

Affront: Horrified onlookers shouted at the bearded man as he disrupted the city's Remembrance Sunday parade today

The Bristol intruder was tackled by a policeman who dragged him through the crowd - as people shouted their disgust at him.

Witnesses say several police officers then had to pin the man down as he initially attempted to resist arrest.

Avon and Somerset Police stayed at the
 scene and surround him to protect him from a small group of men who 
threatened to harm him.

Today Jose Paulo Da Silveria, 38, was charged under the Public Order Act, police said.

An Avon and Somerset Police spokeswoman said: 'Police arrested a 38-year-old man at the Remembrance Sunday service in Bristol city centre.

'He was taken into custody.'Jose Paulo Da Silveria has been charged under the Public Order Act and will appear at Bristol

Magistrates’ Court on December 4.'

As he was bundled into a police car 
yesterday, officers had to forcefully remove several males who approached him and 
shouted obscenities and ‘death’s too good for you’.

Witness Nick Calvert, 51, said: ‘He came down on a skateboard and was wearing a pink outfit and a mask with horns.

‘A policeman grabbed him and dragged 
him through the crowd rather swiftly. When he saw the policeman he tried
 to get off his board but he got him.

‘There was a general show of disgust from the crowd because he was showing no respect. I have no idea what it was about.’

Ray Turton, 68, said: ‘The police dragged him through the crowd and tried to rip his mask off.

‘He put up a lot of resistance and they had to use quite some force to restrain him. People were shouting "rip his head off".’

At the Cenotaph memorial in London the monarch laid the first wreath to commemorate members of the Armed Forces who died fighting in all conflicts since the First World War.

In brilliant autumn sunshine, senior members of the monarchy joined Prime Minister David Cameron, military chiefs, servicemen and women and thousands of watching spectators in paying their respects.

When the first stroke of 11 sounded from nearby Big Ben, Whitehall observed a two-minute silence only punctuated by the hum of distant London traffic and birds. The Queen laid the first wreath, followed by the Duke of Edinburgh.

Then the Duke of Cambridge, wearing his RAF uniform, laid a wreath, under the gaze of the Duchess of Cambridge, who watched from a balcony at the Foreign Office alongside the Countess of Wessex and the Princess Royal's husband Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Lawrence.

William was followed by the Duke of York, the Earl of Wessex, the Princess Royal, Prince Michael of Kent and Field Marshal Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank.

Wreaths were also laid by Mr Cameron, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, opposition leader Ed Miliband and Westminster Plaid Cymru group leader Elfyn Llwyd, as well as high commissioners from Commonwealth countries and leaders of the Armed Forces.

The crowds watching the service in central London could be the largest yet, the Royal British Legion said.

Tribute: Thousands of people had gathered in Bristol to pay their respects to the millions of people who had fought and died for their country

The charity's head of remembrance, 
Helen Hill, said that numbers were swollen as recent conflicts brought 
the realities of war home to a new generation and created ‘people who 
are aged 18-and-a-half who are veterans of recent conflicts’.

‘Once again the British public has 
shown its support,’ she said, adding that the number of veterans 
marching had increased by 3,000 in the last five years.

‘The numbers are going up, not down. 
There are an increasing number of associations looking after the veteran
 community. More and more people want to participate in the activities.’

The Prince of Wales and Duchess of 
Cornwall earlier attended a ceremony in Auckland as part of their 
Jubilee tour of New Zealand.

Under grey skies the royals sat with 
New Zealand's prime minister John Key, veterans from across the decades,
 and members of the public around the Auckland Cenotaph.

The Duke of Kent was also overseas, representing the Queen at a service in the Falkland Islands.

Thousands of people also respected the
 two-minute silence on Twitter, abstaining from posting messages during 
the period of reflection. The idea was spread using the hashtag 
#2minutesilence.

In Northern Ireland, the prime 
minister of the Republic of Ireland Taoiseach Enda Kenny attended the 
remembrance service in Enniskillen. The symbolic visit came as the Co 
Fermanagh town marked the 25th anniversary of the IRA Poppy Day bomb 
attack, which claimed the lives of 12 people.

Mr Kenny laid a laurel wreath at the cenotaph, only yards from where the no-warning blast detonated a quarter of a century ago.

Veterans' representatives laid wreaths
 at the Cenotaph before almost 10,000 ex-servicemen and women marched 
past to commemorate their fallen comrades.

This year's Remembrance commemoration 
is the first to take place since the death of the last veteran to serve 
during the First World War on either side, according to the Royal 
British Legion.

There was warm applause from the crowd as the parade marched past the giant war memorial, inscribed to The Glorious Dead.

In Scotland, First Minister Alex 
Salmond joined the Lord Lieutenant and Lord Provost of Edinburgh Donald 
Wilson, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore, military leaders, veterans and
 serving personnel at the Stone of Remembrance at the City Chambers in 
Edinburgh.

He observed a two minute silence and 
laid a wreath on behalf of the people of Scotland. The First Minister 
then attended a Service of Remembrance at St Giles Cathedral.

Meanwhile, in Yorkshire inspirational 
war hero Ben Parkinson - the country's most injured serviceman to 
survive his wounds - paid his respects to his fallen comrades by bravely
 walking to lay his wreath at a Remembrance Day Service.

Lance Bombardier Parkinson has become a
 symbol of the bravery of British war heroes as he battles back after 
losing both legs and breaking his back, hips and ribs in a landmine 
blast in Afghanistan in 2006.

Watched by hundreds of people, Ben rose to his feet from his wheelchair, helped by mum Diane Dernie and stepdad Andy Dernie.

The 28-year-old slowly walked 300 
yards, with the aid of crutches, to pay his respects at a war memorial 
in his hometown of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, as a wreath was laid on 
his behalf.

He spent about 10 minutes on his short
 prosthetic 'stubbies', before returning, smiling, to his wheelchair to a
 raucous applause from the crowd to join in

singing the national anthem.

He said: 'I am very proud to be here. 
It is important for me to pay my respects. I'm doing unbelievably well, 
but there's still a lot further to go. I want to do even better next 
year.'
