The worst of thousands of London rioters was jailed for eight years today after his ten hour 'orgy of looting' in which he smashed a brick through a police car while wearing a skull mask.

Alexander Elliott-Joahill, 19, went on a 
night long rampage, looting and hurling rocks at police officers while 
disguised behind a full face hoodie painted with a skull.

He also attacked a WPC, smashing a brick through the window of her police car and making her fear for her life.

'Worst': Alexander Elliott-Joahill, 19, went on a

He was eventually arrested alongside Exeter University student Laura Johnson and another youth on a ransacked retail park in south London during last August’s riots.

He was caught loading TVs into a car driven by the 20-year-old millionaire's daughter.

Straight A-student Johnson was ealier jailed for two years for using her Smart car to act as a chauffeur for rioters including Ellioot Joahill.

Today, Blackfriars Crown Court heard of Elliott-Joahill’s rampage before his arrest.

He had started his crime spree ten 
hours earlier when he was seen wearing a hoodie that zipped up to cover 
his face with a skull and brandishing a five inch bladed serrated 
fishing knife.

Police officers manning a line to stop
rioters spreading through Lewisham saw Elliott-Joahill making jerking 
stabbing motions towards police before egging other rioters on by 
hurling bricks at them.

An 
hour later still brandishing the knife Elliott-Joahill was part of a mob
that descended on two officers in a police car with Elliott-Joahill 
leading the attack by throwing a brick that pierced a door next to a 
WPC.

He then picked up the 
brick again and hurled it threw the window showering glass on the 
terrified policewoman and cutting her hands and arms.

Prosecutor Alison Wilkes said 'panic and terror' pervaded the car and in a witnesses statement the WPC said: 'I was scared if we did not get the car started we would be dragged out of the car and badly hurt or killed.'

The court heard the car started and the officers made it to Lewisham Hospital but had to be evacuated because rioters were heading there too.

Sentence: Elliott-Joahill is seen 
breaking fried chicken shop in Catford where he sprang on to the 
counter with a gang of hoodie rioters in front of the terrified worker 
and a couple and a child in a pram around 7pm

Still wearing his skull hoodie the 
teenager, who has previous convictions for a gunpoint robbery and having
a knife, then took part in the breaking in and looting of an antiques 
shop as the owner and his son sat terrified inside.

Elliott-Joahill
was seen throwing bricks at the window before escaping with a bundle of
DVDs and then throwing bottles at officers who came to the shopkeepers 
aid, forcing them to retreat.

The shopkeeper was beaten up inside his shop until members from his local mosque came to protect what remained of his shop.

He then played a leading role in the 
robbery of a fried chicken shop in Catford where he sprang on to the 
counter with a gang of hoodie rioters in front of the terrified worker 
and a couple and a child in a pram around 7pm.

The
owner came under a hail of chairs and tables as the gang tries to steal
the till and he responded by throwing hot oil in a bid to defend 
himself. Undeterred the thieves made off with the till and £600.

Frightening: Elliott-Joahill started his crime spree ten hours
earlier when he was seen wearing a hoodie that zipped up to cover his 
face with a skull and brandishing a five inch bladed serrated fishing 
knife

Elliott-Joahill
admitted violent disorder, robbery, criminal damage, having a knife, 
three burglaries and three offences of handling stolen goods.

He had denied attempting to cause GBH with intent on the attack on the WPC but was found guilty after a trial.

Sentencing Elliott-Joahill, now 19, Recorder Julian Malins QC said: 'This is plainly one of the worst series of offences committed during the riots.'

While accepting he had shown remorse he added: 'Nevertheless, you must appreciate each of these offences were very serious offences.

'Taking the overall criminality of these two days, it must be plain to you as it is plain to anyone that has seen the CCTV, let alone the victims of these crimes, your case must be one of the most serious cases arising from the riots of last year.'

Elliott-Joahill of Lee, South East London, was jailed for five years for the attack on the WPC, and a further three years for the other offences.
