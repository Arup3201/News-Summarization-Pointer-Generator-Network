Meteoric rise, and ignominious fall: Former chief executive of News International Rebekah Brooks

As a young reporter, at the beginning of her career, Rebekah Brooks was described by her editor as 'the most ambitious person I have ever met'.

Mystic Meg, an early friend and colleague, couldn’t have forecast it better.

It took 20 years for the Cheshire-born redhead to rise from researcher on the News of the World’s Sunday magazine to the head of News International, the UK arm of Rupert Murdoch’s global empire.

At each stage of her meteoric rise her ability to survive in the cut-throat world of newspapers, dominated by middle-aged male executives, was questioned.

'It won’t last,' was a favourite comment said behind her back.

They were right.

But it was her determination, hard work and total focus on her career that got her noticed, and promoted.

Early critics harped at her lack of a traditional hard-news apprenticeship, she hadn’t served her time on local papers.

But her secret weapon was that most traditional of journalistic tools, the ability to target and foster important contacts. And her skill was to remain friendly with them after the stories had run.

During her first job at News International, as feature writer on the News of the World’s Sunday magazine, she was sent to interview footballer Paul Gascoigne, who had moved to Rome to play for Lazio, and his wife Sheryl.

Rebekah turned up at the airport to travel out with the couple to discover that she was being joined on the trip by a very experienced reporter from a rival newspaper.

Most young journalists would have buckled and come back empty-handed.

Rebekah unleashed the charm that would shape her career to befriend Paul, and more importantly, Sheryl.

She came back with her first splash for the News of the World and the first of many strong contacts that would help shape her future career.

Patsy Chapman, the then editor of the News of The World, was impressed and within days Rebekah was yanked 'upstairs' to join the paper.

'It’ll never last,' was muttered around El Vinos.

But times were changing for newspapers, and their staff.

The
market was becoming more competitive and the pressure to be sharper 
than the rest was growing. Long liquid lunches were on the way 
out.

Rebekah put in the hours, always going the extra yard to give herself an edge in her quest to move up.

For
instance when fellow colleagues moaned that they didn’t have a clue 
what was going on in TV soaps, as they were never home in time to see 
them, Rebekah had them taped for her.

As
she waited for the first edition of the paper to print she used her one
bit of down time to watch the tapes and catch up on the storylines, 
making sure she could answer Piers Morgan’s quickfire questions he fired
at his staff during his editorial conferences as editor of The News of 
The World.

And so she impressed and moved up through the ranks of the features desk to become features editor and then deputy editor.

She summed up her early struggles up the newspapers career ladder with this recollection from her 2009 Hugh Cudlipp lecture to aspiring journalists at the London College of Communications.

'When at the age of 27, I was made deputy editor of the News of the World, some struggled with the concept.

'At a corporate event, a senior male executive lost the buttons off his shirt.

'The editor and I were busy meeting and greeting our high profile guests when suddenly a shirt and some buttons were thrust into my hand.

"When you’ve got a minute darling‘ – sew ‘em back on for me."

'Despite needlework not being my strong point, I did have the shirt ready in time.

'And we were all sorry to hear what happened to him!'

He didn’t last.

The toughest part of working at a red top tabloid, with its constant 'turning over' of people is keeping hold of your contacts.

But Rebekah had the unique flair for befriending people that were important to her and keeping hold of them.

She worked hard at making sure celebrities and their agents fell for her charm.

She was tagged, 'The most charming tabloid operator of all time'.

She even took golf lessons so as she could network at the News International celebrity golf tournament.

It worked. On the course she met Ross Kemp, then one of TVs' biggest stars thanks to his role as Grant Mitchell in EastEnders.

He was smitten, wooed her with a £20,000 art deco engagement ring and they married in 2002 in Las Vegas.

The
marriage didn’t last, in fact it exploded in November 2005 when Rebekah
was arrested for an alleged assault on hard man Ross.

She was released without charge and went straight from the police station to the morning news conference she was due to chair.

For
once, the usually boisterous room was hushed as the news editor read 
through his list of news stories getting no reaction from a head-bowed 
Rebekah.

By chance or design he had left on his list an item about domestic violence.

Rebekah’s reaction sums up her abilty to deal with adversity. With all eyes on her, she looked up with a smile that said, 's**t happens'. The room erupted with laughter and normal service was restored.

As her career moved up so did her circle of contacts and friends.

After a spell as deputy editor of The Sun in 1998, where she questioned whether it was time to stop running the Page Three girls, she became, at the time, the youngest editor of national British newspaper just days before her 32nd birthday when she was appointed editor of the News of the World in 2000.

It was there, following the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne, that she launched her controversial Sarah’s Law campaign to name to name and shame convicted sex offenders.

'I had just joined the News of the World as editor,' she explained, 'and after the daily pace of The Sun was frustrated by the waiting room atmosphere of a Sunday paper newsroom on a Tuesday.

Courting controversy: Rebekah Brooks with Sara Payne, mother of murdered Sarah Payne. Brooks campaigned for Sarah's Law, to name and shame sex offenders

'So I took a chance and drove down to see Sarah’s parents Mike and Sara.

'The press pack waiting outside were more than a little surprised when I turned up on the doorstep.

'Inexplicably Mike and Sara agreed to see me and the repercussions of that meeting started the Sarah’s law campaign.'

In 2003 she became the first female editor of The Sun.

The Sun prides itself on its political influence. Its owner Rupert Murdoch expects it.

Rebekah made sure she delivered.

She became close friends with then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.

When Rebekah married former racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks in 2009 wedding guests included Tory leader David Cameron and Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

And when Rebekah threw a Christmas 
party at her Cotswold home last December, top of the invite list were 
near neighbours the Camerons.

But the most important person she has charmed in her career is Rupert Murdoch.

In 2009 he appointed her chief executive Officer of News International.

Media commentators refer to her as 'close to the family' and for her birthday Rupert gave her an original painting by L S Lowry.

Way things were: Elisabeth Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks at a lunch for women in business at 10 Downing Street. Today it emerged that Miss Murdoch allegedly accused her erstwhile friend of 'f******' the company

As the phone hacking scanda grew, Rupert Murdoch showed his support for Rebekah.

He was pictured smiling as 
he left a restaurant in central London with his arm round her following an hour-long meeting at his luxury flat last weekend.

When asked what his top priority was, Murdoch gestured at her and said: 'This one'.

As pressure grew for Rebekah to 
resign, with even David Cameron calling the action 'truly 
dreadful', he said: 'Recent
allegations of phone hacking and making payments to police with respect
to the News of the World are deplorable and unacceptable.

'I
have made clear that our company must fully and proactively cooperate 
with the police in all investigations and that is exactly what News 
International has been doing and will continue to do under Rebekah 
Brooks' leadership.'

And, while the media commentators 
predicted and awaited the news of Rebekah’s resignation, Murdoch once 
again pulled the rug from under their feet by choosing to close the 
168-year News of The World instead.

But in the end even that monumental decision couldn't save the fiercely ambitious high-flier.

Today it emerged that Rupert's daughter Elisabeth allegedly said Rebekah had 'f****** the company'.

They said it wouldn't last.

It hasn't.
