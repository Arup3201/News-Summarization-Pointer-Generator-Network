The wife of a biker who was severely injured by a Range Rover that was trying to escape a swarm of motorcyclists has held a candle-lit silent vigil outside the hospital where he is being kept.

Dayana Mieses has insisted that her husband, 26-year-old Edwin Mieses Jr., was simply trying to help another rider when he was hit.

She said the biker, from Lawrence, Massachusetts, suffered broken legs and spine injuries that have left him paralyzed.

Motorcyclists joined Dayana Mieses in a vigil for her husband and their fellow rider Edwin, who was severely injured

She was joined by friends, relatives and dozens of bikers in a silent rally outside St Luke's Roosevelt Hospital, the NY Daily News said.

However, not as many people showed up to support the biker as had been planned because police stopped large numbers of them riding to the hospital together, the NY Post reported

The crew was planning to assemble 100 bikers in East New York and ride all the way to St Luke’s Hospital.

But police officers were waiting to intervene and break up the gang's joint ride.

As friends gathered in silent support of their friend, the NYPD released images as they asked for help in identifying and locating suspects wanted in connection with the attack.

Police released images of men they wanted to talk to in connection with the attack, it was reported

'Victim': Edwin Mieses Jr, 26, from Massachusetts was hit by a Range Rover as it tried to escape a group of bikers. But Mieses' family has said that he was simply trying to help another biker who was hurt

Emotional: His mother sobbed as she said how the spinal damage meant he would never walk again

Speaking out: Dayana Mieses insisted that her husband was not part of a gang but simply enjoyed riding

Anger: The family of Mieses said they are considering pressing charges against the driver

'There's no hope for his back,' Mrs 
Mieses said. 'They crushed his spine. They broke it in two different 
places, so he will be forever, forever paralyzed.'

His devastated mother, Yolanda Santiago, sobbed: 'He's never going to walk again.'

The
father-of-two, an aspiring rapper who also goes by the name Jay Meezee,
was part of a group of bikers that allegedly surrounded a SUV driver 
after he hit one of them in Manhattan on Sunday.

The
driver, 33-year-old Alexian Lien, was scared for the safety of his wife
and two-year-old child, who were both in the car, and knocked a few of 
them down so he could escape, police said.

Mieses, who is a father, was among 
the bikers hit but his family have claimed that he was not intimidating 
Lien and was simply trying to help another biker.

'When all the bikers stopped, my husband got out, parked his bike to walk over to try to help his friend,' she said.

Fears: Mieses, pictured left and right with his wife Dayana, will not walk again, his family has said

'He walked over towards the front of 
the vehicle when, at this point, I don't know what happened: the man was
scared, the man just peeled off and ran over my husband.'

She said that the bikers have all been portrayed as villains.

'Everyone wants to blame the bikers for something this man did,' she said.

'I'm devastated. I'm devastated,' 
Yolanda Santiago, Mieses' mother, added to NY1. 'All his ribs are so badly 
bruised that they say he's still on the ventilator.'

The family said they are considering pressing charges against the driver and friends set up a Facebook group to 
rally for 'justice'.

They posted: 'He's the victim yet he and his group 
are being treated like they are the criminals.'

Arrest: Christopher Cruz is pictured (in white) before he was rear-ended by Range Rover driver Alexian Lien on Sunday - which sparked a massive chase. Cruz has been arrested for reckless driving

'My son is out of surgery thank God,'
Mieses' father, the Rev. Edwin Mieses, wrote on his own Facebook page. 
'Now comes dealing with him not able to walk again.'

Police said the bikers continued to chase Lien and ambushed his car when it came to a stop in Manhattan traffic. They they allegedly attacked him, leaving him needing stitches.

Police said they do not expect to arrest him but Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said they were still investigating the incident.

'Well, it depends on what the circumstances are,' Kelly said.

'It depends on whether or not your vehicle is being attacked, whether or not you think you're being attacked, whether or not your wife and child's in the car.

'You have to look at the totality of the circumstances, and that's what we're doing.'

A motorcyclist was charged yesterday 
with reckless driving after prosecutors said he sparked the tense 
encounter with the driver of an SUV and a throng of other bikers that 
ended with terrible injuries.

Fears: Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York on Sunday as he tried to protect his wife and child. He hit some bikers in a bid to escape them but they caught up and beat him

Christopher Cruz, 28, of Passaic, New 
Jersey, declined to comment as he was released on $1,500 bail, facing 
misdemeanor charges that also include unlawful imprisonment. His 
attorney, H. Benjamin Perez, said his client denied all the allegations.

'He will come back to fight this case and clear his name,' he said.

Cruz is the only person charged 
criminally so far in the Sunday encounter that was caught on a 
helmet-mounted camera worn by another biker and was posted online 
anonymously.

The Manhattan district attorney's 
office decided not immediately to prosecute a second person arrested, 
Allen Edwards, 42, who surrendered to police on Tuesday.

But prosecutors said the investigation
continues, and they served notice that they intend to take the case 
against Cruz to a grand jury - a sign that more serious charges are 
likely.

Karen Friedman-Agnifilo, the 
prosecutor overseeing the DA's investigation, said authorities were 
trying to build the strongest cases possible.

Police are still searching for other motorcyclists who dragged Lien out of the Range Rover and beat and slashed him.

Lien, a Columbia University graduate
who now works at Credit Suisse, was taken to Columbia University 
Medical Center, where he received stitches. He was later released.

The
footage of the run-in was captured on a helmet camera of a motorcyclist during an 
annual bikers' event in New York City, at around 2pm on Sunday.

A police spokesman said that Lien recalled how a large number of 
motorcyclists were driving 'erratically' and he 'accidentally collided 
with one'.

The footage shows one motorcyclist brake hard in front the the car and seems to get bumped by it.

He
pulled over but some of the bikers started to damage the vehicle, he said. The 
NYPD spokesman told MailOnline the driver drove off 'to avoid an 
impending assault'.

The video shows the Range Rover accelerate suddenly knocking over bikes and motorcyclists, driving over the top of them.

The footage shows them following the vehicle for several minutes, at times getting close and intimidating the driver. Eventually the bikers surround the vehicle, blocking its path.

Fearful: The bikers had been riding alongside the Range Rover before the incident. Shortly after this moment, the biker in blue jeans - Christopher Cruz - braked

Intimidating: Within minutes, the whole pack has caught up with the vehicle, with the family inside

Seizing
an opportunity to confront the driver, one biker dismounts and tries to
open the door, but the SUV speeds off again, knocking down at least one
more motorcyclist.

The
family are eventually brought to a standstill in Manhattan traffic and 
immediately bikers run to attack the vehicle, smashing the driver's 
window with a helmet and attempting to smash the rear door window, where the child was sitting. The footage then stops.

The
video was posted by a biker, under the name GIXXARDR on Liveleaks, from
Melbourne, Australia, this morning. He claims one biker was killed, 
which the police said was not true.

Already it has received numerous comments, most are in support of Lien.

One
person, whose profile name is Sgt Pepper, says:  'I would do exactly 
the same thing. They're intimidating him and he's probably fearing for 
his life.'

Altercation: Apparently intimidated, the driver then accelerates away knocking down bikers in its path

Smashed: When they come to a standstill in heavy traffic, it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle, smashing the driver's window with his helmet

Another, known as 'zacarra' says the driver acted in 'self defense'.

'Did
you see the biker break (sic) check him in the beginning. This poor guy
was running for his life from the start,' zacarra writes.

'charlesferg' says the NYC has now banned the riders' annual event.

State Senator Adriano Espaillat (D-Washington Heights) told MailOnline he's fed-up with motorcycle gangs rabble-rousing on his district streets.

'There’s too much out-of-control motorcyclist behavior in our community, and it's made Washington Heights residents feel unsafe,' said Sen. Espaillat.

The lawmaker added that on multiple occasions he's experienced the same provocative tactics the motorcyclists used on Sunday against Lien’s family.

'The victim of this attack was clearly scared of the motorcyclists’ aggressive posturing. We need common-sense safeguards to stop this behavior.'
