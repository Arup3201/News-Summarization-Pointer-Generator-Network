Danny Cipriani’s hopes of a Six Nations recall have been boosted by two conversations with England head coach Stuart Lancaster.

The Sale fly-half has been in outstanding form following a summer in which he made two substitute appearances on England’s injury-hit tour to New Zealand — his first international caps for six years.

The 27-year-old, who will consider a move to French club Toulon if he is overlooked for the upcoming tournament, remains behind Bath’s George Ford and Saracens’ Owen Farrell in England’s No 10 pecking order.

But he is putting pressure on current third choice Stephen Myler, of Northampton, following some superb recent displays. 

Lancaster met last week with Cipriani — whose brushes with authority and high-profile lifestyle have made England coaches wary of recalling him — and Sportsmail understands they also spoke on Tuesday.

‘Danny’s encouraged by the conversations with Stuart,’ said a source.

Cipriani is expected to be named in the Saxons side to face Irish Wolfhounds on January 30.

Lancaster and his coaches will hold a selection meeting on Thursday. 

He will announce his 33-man Six Nations squad next Wednesday ahead of the opening fixture against Wales on February 6.

Meanwhile, London Irish are set to announce the signing of All Black star Ben Franks. Sportsmail understands the 41-cap prop will join the Sunbury-based outfit after the 2015 World Cup in a deal worth around £300,000 per season.

The Exiles also confirmed that another Kiwi — highly rated Chiefs assistant coach Tom Coventry — will take over as director of rugby from the departed Brian Smith next season.

Coventry said in a radio interview in New Zealand: ‘I’m pretty sure he (Franks) has gone through the process of signing his contract with them.

‘It’s good to have him there, another Kiwi and a quality player.

‘Obviously I was training teams to combat Ben’s strength so it would be nice to have him on my side for a change.’
