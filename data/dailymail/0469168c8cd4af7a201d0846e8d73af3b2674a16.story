A legal panel deciding whether a nurse who called a colleague an 'a***hole' should keep her job, failed to reach a ruling today, clocking off at 4pm because they were 'too tired'.

Anne Gallacher must now wait to find out if she can remain in the nursing profession 
after her hearing at the Nursing and Midwifery Council in London was adjourned, with no date set for it to be concluded.

Final submissions in the case had all been heard by around 2.30pm at which point chair of the three-person tribunal Pamela 
Mansell said the final decision should probably be be left until a later date.  

A legal panel deciding whether Anne Gallacher (pictured) can keep her nursing job after calling a colleague an 'a***hole' clocked off at 4pm because they were 'too 
tired'

She said: ‘The panel, after careful consideration, do not anticipate
being able to conclude this afternoon.

‘We cannot be seen to be working late and making decisions when the panel are tired and risking legal challenges.’ 

The panel last appeared in the courtroom at 4pm.

Gallacher, who works at the Princess Elizabeth Hospital in Guernsey, has 
been found guilty of assaulting her colleague and using racist language 
against her.

She admitted 
calling the woman an a***hole and saying ‘the black girls in the 
lounge’, but denies that this was racist.

She defended the use of the word 'a***hole by claiming it was a ‘figure of speech in Scotland’, the 
Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

The row began in the communal lounge of their accommodation on Route de Cobo, Castel, Guernsey on June 4, 2011.

Gallacher and her boyfriend entered the room where the woman was sitting with two friends.

The hearing heard the boyfriend began threatening the housemate and she called the police.

Gallacher is then accused of slapping the woman in the face, though she claimed she was trying to push the phone away.

Rachel Ellis, for the NMC, accused Gallacher of hurling racist abuse at the woman and her friends.

‘She was crying and you started mocking her,' Ms Ellis said. ‘The reason she was crying is because you assaulted her.

‘It’s correct that you leaned across, slapped her in the face and pushed her shoulder.

‘You
were convicted of assaulting her at Guernsey Magistrates Court, you 
pleaded not guilty and gave evidence and the judge was satisfied beyond 
all reasonable doubt that you assaulted her.’

The housemate told the hearing: ‘She managed to slap me on my left side.

‘I
just couldn’t believe she had hit me and she started singing "you hit 
me, you hit me - I should have hit you until you were black and blue you
f****** c***, you a***hole".'

Gallacher, originally from Glenrothes, Fife, then went on to talk about ‘you lot taking over the place’, the woman claimed.

‘She
was just speaking to anyone that would listen to her - police and other
nurses that were there. With her arms she was gesturing into the room,’
she said.

‘I have never seen her with a face like that before. She was more like snarling at me - it was like nobody mattered.’

Gallacher
is also accused of racially motivated abuse to another woman known as 
Miss B, after allegedly saying ‘these foreigners are taking over the 
house’ and referring to ‘all of the black people’ on an unknown date.

The Scottish nurse was found guilty of assaulting Ms A - but claims the attack was racially motivated were dismissed.

Judge
Philip Robey said while Gallacher was aggressive and abusive, the 
assault was a minor one and imposed a bind over order to be of good 
behaviour for two years.

She was previously convicted of disorderly conduct and fined £600 at Guernsey Magistrates Court on 9 August 2010.

Gallacher
was also convicted of driving while unfit and resisting or obstructing 
police at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court on 29 June 2004.

On that occasion she was put on probation for 18 months, disqualified from driving for four years and ordered to pay £300.

The hearing continues.

Gallacher told the hearing she used to have drink 
problems and a series of further charges have been proved against her in
relation to criminal convictions which happened when she was drunk.

The panel will now have to resume their deliberations on a date to be fixed.
