With the only female under 50 in the camp engaged, Essex playboy Mark Wright was undoubtedly becoming a little restless in the Australian jungle.

So the helpful I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! producers came up with a plan to raise temperatures and create a little romance around the campfire.

Australian model and DJ Emily Scott arrived in the jungle last night as the newest 'celebrity' recruit.

New recruit: Australian model Emily Scott joined the celebrities in the jungle tonight

Flirtation: It wasn't long before Mark Wright was making his move on the model

The 28-year-old arrived at the camp at nightfall, greeting her new camp mates with 'Knock, knock! Hi, I'm Emily, I'll be joining you.'

Mark's delight was clear to see as he took in the new recruit, and he later admitted: 'I heard someone say "hello," and I turned around and first I saw blonde hair, then I saw a treasure chest.'

Dougie was equally impressed, but given his taken status, he preferred to estimate how long it would take for Mark to make his move.

Reality show pro: Emily has already competed on Love Island 2007, Cirque de Celebrité 2007 and Australia's Dancing with the Stars 2009

Within a few minutes Mark and Emily were making plans to go out in the Gold Coast once their time in the jungle was up.

Pat teased Mark about moving in on Emily so quickly, calling him a 'a little tinker.'

Pat pointed out that Emily’s skin was very fair. 'Makes a change from an Essex girl' retorted Mark.

Even Jessica-Jane welcomed Emily with open arms. 'It's a nice change to have another younger girl,' she said. 'I have a new playmate!'

'I thought she was a kiss-o-gram,' admitted Chrissy.

Miss Scott is best known in the UK for appearing on ITV's Love Island in 2006, and briefly dating David Walliams in 2007.

She was voted Australia's Sexiest Woman by FHM readers that same year and has appeared in a number of other celebrity competitions including Australia's Dancing with the Stars in 2009 and Sky One's Cirque de Celebrité in 2007.

Celebrite

She met her former husband Ritchie Neville of Nineties boy band 5ive on the latter: the pair married in 2008 and moved to Sydney, but split four months later.

Their marriage was largely out of the public eye until June 2009 when Neville was given an AVO following allegations of domestic abuse. Scott alleges that a scar on her face is the result of Neville cutting her with glass.

But the club DJ is rather unrecognisable from her modelling days in the lads' mags - she is now sporting a short, candy pink bob.
