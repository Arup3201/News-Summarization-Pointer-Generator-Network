The region of Molina de Aragon, in Spain, is as barren as it is beautiful.

Since the 1950s and continuing through to today, the process of de-industrialisation and de-population has left behind a vast region of Central Eastern Spain that is infamous for its staggeringly low number of inhabitants.

In fact, there are so few people who live in these particular municipalities that the area now competes with Siberia and the Arctic provinces of Lapland as the least populated zone in Europe.

Despite the barren landscape, agriculture and ranching remain the main economic sources all around the vast region.

The square footage of the underpopulated Central region is as large as Austria, and just two hours drive from Madrid.

Quickly becoming known as Europe's largest desert - at least in terms of population - the area is made up of the provinces of Soria, Guadalajara, Teruel and Cuenca. 

And the population that remains is aging.

Currently, 41 percent of the whole population is over 65 years of age, while a shocking eight per cent is under the age of 15.

Juan Romero, for example, is the only boy in the village of Selas, a municipality located in the province of Guadalajara.

The school is Selas was shut down in 1974 and moved to Molina de Aragon, which is the largest village in the region, with a population of 3,706.

Every weekday, Juan has to travel 68 km to get to school. 

According to official figures, the area has 1.63 inhabitants for every square kilometre, compared to the 1.8 of Laponia and 3 inhabitants for every square kilometre in Siberia.

However, Javier Munoz, the former mayor of Selas, points out that these figures could be even lower than suggested because the official census does not represent the actual population of the villages.
