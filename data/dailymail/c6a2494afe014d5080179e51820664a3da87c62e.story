Italy midfielder Daniele De Rossi was full of praise for England captain Steven Gerrard, describing facing him as 'always a pleasure and an honour'.

Speaking after Italy's 2-1 win over England in Manaus, the Roma star compared Gerrard to Andrea Pirlo, Xavi and Andres Iniesta, as well as England team-mate Frank Lampard.

The Italian hard-man also had a pop at team-mate and match-winner Mario Balotelli, saying the former Manchester City striker would score three times the number of goals if he made the right movements.

'It is never normal for me to play against Gerrard,' De Rossi said after the game. 'It always gets me emotional, I won’t deny it.

'Of course, on the field you’ve got to get stuck in there, but it is always a pleasure and an honour. He’s also a very nice guy, always very approachable.

'I cheered on Liverpool until the end, but they lost the Premier League title in an incredible way.

'Players like Gerrard, Andrea Pirlo, Frank Lampard, Xavi or Iniesta never go past the apex of their careers.'

De Rossi was less kind about Mario Balotelli, who scored the goal which beat England in Brazil on Saturday night.

'Balotelli is a player with great quality and his goal was scored with the movement of a real hitman.

'He has the quality of the greatest strikers, but sometimes doesn’t move the way they do. This is a problem for him, as he’d score triple the goals if he made the right movements.

'Mario is starting to understand that now, as his teammates and the Coach help him. You can see he is beginning to mature tactically.

'In my view if Balotelli learned to run into space and stretch out the team, he’d become unstoppable, because physically there are no defenders who can hold him.'

Italy are second in Group D behind Costa Rica, who shocked Uruguay on Saturday. The two sides meet in Recife on Friday, with a win virtually guaranteeing progress to the knock-out stages.
