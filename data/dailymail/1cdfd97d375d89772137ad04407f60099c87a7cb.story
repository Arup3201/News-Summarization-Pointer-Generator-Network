'I used to love going to the match. I still do, but not as often as I'd like to anymore. When I do go it reminds me of those happy days as a kid.'

And on a rare visit to Anfield on Monday the former X Factor judge was treated to a vintage Liverpool performance as Brendan Rodgers' side ran out comfortable winners against the south Wales club.

Alberto Moreno, an Adam Lallana brace and an own goal by former Red Jonjo Shelvey secured a 4-1 win with Gylfi Sigurdsson netting for the Swans.

Liverpool leapfrogged Newcastle and Monday's opponents Swansea to move up to eighth in the Premier League.
