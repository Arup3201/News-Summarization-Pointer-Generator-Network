The New York subway could remain closed for up to four days until flood waters were pumped from tunnels, authorities said on Tuesday, but there was yet no timetable for when the system would reopen.

Seven subway tunnels under the East River were flooded and many stations submerged as the city was battered by the full force of Hurricane Sandy.

Metro Transit Authority chairman Joseph Lhota said: 'The New York City subway system is 108 years old, but it has never faced a disaster as devastating as what we experienced last night.'

The NY subway system is used by around
five million commuters a day and closing the network will have massive 
repercussions for the city's economy.

Residents
of Manhattan were effectively marooned on the island and those living 
in outlying boroughs had limited means of travel as almost all bridges 
were closed and many roads blocked by flood waters and fallen trees.

It
will take 14 hours to four days to get out the water that has flooded 
the subway tunnels in New York, Metro Transit Authority spokesman Kevin 
Ortiz said.

The greatest problems had happened in the subway tunnels connecting Manhattan to Queens and Brooklyn under the East River.

Transport shutdowns affected every borough across New York, New Jersey, Long Island and stretching into Connecticut. 

The Long Island Rail Road was partially evacuated and suffered flooding in an East River tunnel.

The Metro-North Railroad went down 
from 59th Street to Croton-Harmon on the Hudson Line and also to New 
Haven on the New Haven Line.

Several bus depots were flooded along with the Queens Midtown Tunnel and Hugh Carey Tunnel.

MTA workers were working through the night and only beginning to assess the damage in the tunnels and on lines.

The Lincoln Tunnel is only one which remains open.

The PATH train linking New York and New Jersey remained closed from noon on Monday due to the widespread storm damage.
