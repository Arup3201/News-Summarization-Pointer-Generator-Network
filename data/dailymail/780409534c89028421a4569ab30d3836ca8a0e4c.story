Angela Wegg, pictured, pocketed £43,000 in disability allowance by claiming she struggled to dress and cook for herself. However, she was actually working two jobs

A mother who claimed £43,000 in benefits by saying she needed help washing and dressing was working two jobs in a bakery and a nursing home, a court heard.

Angela Wegg, 34, from Ipswich, Suffolk, told authorities her disability meant she needed help washing, dressing and cooking meals.

In a claim form for Disability Living Allowance, the mother-of-two said she struggled with mobility - and could only walk one to three metres.

But Department of Work and Pensions investigators launched an urgent probe after receiving a tip-off she had two jobs.

Investigators discovered that Wegg
 had been working in the bakery at a Tesco store in Ipswich as well as 
at the town’s Monmouth Court care home.

They also saw Wegg walking over two miles with her two German Shepherd dogs as well as walking her children to school without using an aid.

The court heard how Wegg, who suffers from a syndrome which affects connective tissues in her body, pocketed £43,000 over a period of seven years by failing to notify the authorities her health had improved.

Wegg admitted dishonestly failing to notify a change in her circumstances between November 2005 and June 2013.

Sentencing her, Judge David Goodin said Wegg had the 'dreadful misfortune' to suffer from a hereditary illness.

But
 he said although her original Disability Living Allowance was 
genuine, she had failed to notify the authorities when she became able to
 work and walk more than three metres or about 10 feet.

Wegg was given a four-month prison sentence suspended for 12 months 
and ordered to attend a Women’s Emotional Well Being course.

Wegg had no previous convictions - and was ordered to repay the 
amount she had been overpaid in £20-a-month installments.

Ipswich Crown Court heard how Wegg's secret employment proved she did not need the benefits she was being handed.

Marcus Croskell, prosecuting, said both her jobs were physically demanding.

He added: 'Part of these duties involved bending, stretching, walking and carrying items.'

The court was told how Wegg was prescribed oral morphine by her GP to control her pain last November.

Despite claiming she could only walk one to three metres, the mother-of-one was holding down two jobs - one at a Tesco bakery and another at Monmouth Court Care Home, pictured

However, Declan Gallagher, defending, accepted that Wegg’s capabilities became greater than she had declared.

He added she hadn’t been living an 'extravagant lifestyle' and her jobs had only paid the minimum wage.

A proceeds of crime hearing will take place later in the year.

A DWP spokesman said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system. Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of.

'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime and, if convicted, you will be handed a criminal record and be ordered to pay back the money.

'Don’t wait for our fraud investigators to find you. Tell us of a change now.'

Wegg, who suffers from a condition that affects connective tissue in her body, failed to notify authorities when her condition improved, the court was told. She fraudulently claimed £43,000 over seven years - and was handed a four month suspended sentence
