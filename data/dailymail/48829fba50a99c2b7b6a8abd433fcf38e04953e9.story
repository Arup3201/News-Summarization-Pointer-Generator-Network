Serena Williams attended an event for lingerie and sports bra brand Berlei on Thursday, the day after the world No 1 was announced as the top seed for the Australian Open.

Williams, who is the face of Berlei, took centre-stage in a TV advertising campaign for the brand that aired for the first time on Monday, a week before the tournament kicks off.

And Williams - who was pictured showing off one of the bras - joined models at the event in Melbourne, where the sportswear range was put to the test with a series of exercises.

Speaking earlier this week about her involvement with Berlei Williams said: 'My mom first discovered Berlei while on a trip to Australia almost 10 years ago and I have been wearing their bras ever since – for every tennis match without fail.

'So when the brand approached me to work with them on their latest campaign for 2015, I jumped at the chance.

'I had such a great time shooting my very first TV commercial for the brand, it's such an exciting campaign that I'm very proud to be part of.'

Meanwhile, two-time champion Victoria Azarenka faces the prospect of drawing a top player in the first round at the Australian Open after missing out on a seeding Wednesday.

Last year was one to forget for Azarenka - injuries to her left foot, then right knee and right foot restricted her to just 24 matches last year and her WTA ranking has dropped to 41. 

The top 32 players are seeded, and tournament officials went strictly by the rankings released Monday to determine the seedings list this year on both the men's and women's side.

Williams and No 2 Maria Sharapova will be on opposite sides of the draw after their world rankings were reflected in the seedings for the first major of the year.

Former No 1 Azarenka, who won the Australian Open in 2012 and 2013 and reached two Grand Slam quarter-finals in 2014 during an injury-interrupted year, dropped from a No 32 year-end ranking.

Azarenka's first-round loss last week at the Brisbane International to Karolina Pliskova, after wasting two match points in the second set, cost her any chance of climbing back into the top 32.

China's Li Na has retired and won't be defending her Australian title. Dominika Cibulkova, the losing finalist last year at Melbourne Park, is seeded No 11. 

Eugenie Bouchard, the 20-year-old Canadian who last year reached the semi-finals at the Australian and French Opens before making the Wimbledon final, is seeded No 7.

Rafael Nadal was put through a rigorous workout on Thursday ahead of the tournament 

On the men's side, Nos 1-3 Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are all seeded ahead of defending men's champion Stan Wawrinka, who is No 4.

US Open finalist Kei Nishikori of Japan was seeded fifth, one spot ahead of three-time Australian Open finalist Andy Murray.

On Wednesday, Nadal had a strong training session at Melbourne Park, indicating he might be overcoming some recent health and injury issues.

Nadal was sidelined for three months with a right wrist injury after Wimbledon. He briefly returned at Beijing in late September where he advanced to the quarterfinals. He then had appendix surgery in early November which he is still recovering from.

'This is the third comeback of my career after injury, so we will see how it goes,' Nadal said.
