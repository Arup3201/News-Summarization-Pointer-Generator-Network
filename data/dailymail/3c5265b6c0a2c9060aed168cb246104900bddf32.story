The train, which had been travelling from Narayongong, about 18 miles from to Dhaka, was forced on its side near Kamlapur Railway Station when the lorry collided with it.

'Either the driver lost control or there was negligence on his part,' Railway Minister Mazibul Hoque told BDNews24 when visiting the scene.

Witnesses told the online newspaper that the lorry driver did not stop even as the train was entering the depot.

Others say the lorry has attempted to cross the tracks in front of the train, but was too slow.

The lorry became stuck in the side of the train, and was dragged some 50 yards along the tracks.

Kamalapur Police said two people had died at the scene, while the other four succumbed to their injuries at hospital.
