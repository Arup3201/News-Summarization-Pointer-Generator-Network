Boxing great Muhummad Ali has won his bout with a severe urinary tract infection.

The three-time world heavyweight champion was released from a hospital Tuesday night, family spokesman Bob Gunnell said Wednesday.

Ali is back home and looking forward to celebrating his 73rd birthday on January 17 with his family and friends, Gunnell said.

'He's in great spirits and enjoying being back home,' Gunnell said. 'He's back in his daily routine.'

Initial reports of Ali's hospitalization declined to reveal where the sports legend was being hospitalized.

However, his daughter Rasheda Ali-Walsh told TMZ in December her father was being treated in his home state of Kentucky.

'My daddy is a strong man. He's so resilient and we're all very grateful and blessed,' Ali-Walsh said at the time.

Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, was diagnosed with the brain disease about three years after he retired from boxing in 1981.

Ali's public appearances have diminished in recent years as he continues to battle Parkinson's disease, but he still enjoys getting out and watching sports and visiting friends.

Ali was hospitalized December 20 with what was initially believed to be a mild case of pneumonia. 

Doctors later determined Ali was suffering from a severe urinary tract infection and not pneumonia, Gunnell said.

He said the Ali family appreciates the outpouring of support and well wishes.

Ali appeared in public in September at a ceremony in his hometown of Louisville for the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Awards. Ali did not speak to the crowd but posed for photos with award winners, including former NFL great Jim Brown.

Brown leaned over and whispered to the seated Ali during the photo session. Later, Brown said he told Ali: 'You're the greatest of all time.' 

Ali and his wife, Lonnie, have homes in Paradise Valley, Arizona; Berrien Springs, Michigan; and in Louisville. Gunnell would not say which of his homes Ali had returned to.
