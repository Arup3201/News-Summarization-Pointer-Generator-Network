Ukip has been forced to scrap a freepost address - after receiving packages containing blood and faeces.

Nigel Farage's anti-EU party, which is currently leading the polls for the European elections later this month, has been inundated with packages from hostile voters.

The party used a freepost address on a leaflet for a campaign in Norwich in 2010 in a bid to drum up support.

Nigel Farage is growing in popularity ahead of this month's crunch European elections - but he is also extremely divisive

But the address was leaked on the internet - allowing opponents of Mr Farage and his party to bombard the address with letters and packages which Ukip would have to pay for.

A campaign began for people to send anything heavy to the address - such as bricks or bottles of water. Other people sent flyers, leaflets and household junk.

Twitter has been inundated with pictures of various packages sent to the Ukip freepost address in a bid to rack up a huge postal bill for the party.

One voter sent a huge Dostoevsky novel using the service complete with Farage's face taped over the picture of 'The Idiot'.

But over the weekend the Ukip's Bexley branch confirmed the freepost address had been cancelled.

On Twitter the local party posted a memo which read: 'You may be aware that there have been incidents of inapproriate mail items being sent to a UKIP Freepost address.

'This includes items which are prohibited (such as blood/human faeces) and present a health and safety risk both to you and our Royal Mail colleagues.

The hostility to Mr Farage was exposed when he was egged by a protester in Nottingham

'The Freepost address for UKIP has been cancelled.'

One angry Ukip supporter wrote: 'What kind of person sends faeces or blood to a political party? Are people OK?'

Despite hostility to the party, Ukip is currently on course to beat the Tories and Labour in this month's European elections.

A poll in The Sunday Times put Ukip on 29 per cent, one point ahead of Labour, with the Conservatives in third.

A second poll for The Sun on Sunday had Ukip three points ahead of Labour.
