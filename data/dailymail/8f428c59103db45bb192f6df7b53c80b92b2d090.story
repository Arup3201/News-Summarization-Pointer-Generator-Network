Former Liverpool midfielder Dirk Kuyt helped his Fenerbahce side remain top of the Turkish Super Lig after bagging a brace against Kasimpasa.

The 34-year-old - who netted 51 league goals in 208 games during a six-year spell with Liverpool - opened the scoring with a fine placed effort from 22-yards after team-mate Diego tucked the ball back to him on the edge of the area.

The Dutchman the showed he still has the attacking instinct when he added a second with a drilled strike following some nifty movement inside the Kasimpasa box.

The 34-year-old scored twice as his side went on to win 3-0 and stay top of the Turkish Super Lig

The Istanbul-based side have now gone 11 games unbeaten, winning their last six games in the Turkish top flight.

Liverpool (2006-2012) - 208 appearances, 51 goals

Fenerbahce (2012-) - 80 appearances , 24 goals 

Hot on their heels are city rivals Galatasaray - who sit just a single point adrift of Fenerbahce - after overcoming struggling side Rizespor thanks to a goal and an assist from Wesley Sneijder.

The Dutchman, who has featured for Ajax, Real Madrid and Inter Milan, put his side ahead on seven minutes with a neat left-footed finish.

Sneijder then helped his side double their lead with a skilfully executed through ball for Bruma to latch on to and lob the on-rushing goalkeeper.
