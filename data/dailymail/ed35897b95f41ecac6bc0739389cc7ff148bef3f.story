High profile: Hacked Off, which has the backing of Hugh Grant, will not reveal who its top donors are

Pressure group Hacked Off is refusing to reveal who is bankrolling them despite campaigning for more transparency in the press.

Senior members would not comment on claims that rich benefactors keen on greater media regulation were covering the costs of the group, which is supported by celebrities including Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan.

Blogger Guido Fawkes claims he has a list that shows key donors include Lady Annabel Goldsmith, mother of Jemima Khan and Zac Goldsmith and billionaire Lord Sainsbury, who was one of Labour's biggest financial backers under Tony Blair.

Another four high-profile donors were claimed to be philosopher Alain de Botton, tycoon Arpad Busson, hairdresser John Frieda and BBC star Jeremy Clarkson.

Mr Clarkson, who is alleged to have made a £1,000 payment to Hacked Off, denied this on Twitter yesterday.

The net worth of these rich and powerful men and women is far in excess of £1billion, and they may have helped support the parents of Milly Dowler and Madeleine McCann from press intrusion.

Members were in front of the the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee today, but were criticised for their performance.

Tory MP Conor Burns, said: 'The champions of openness that is Hacked Off refuse to name large private donors in non-answers to my questions'.

Philip Davies, one of 14 Conservative MPs who rebelled last night 
over a Commons amendment enabling the courts to impose exemplary damages
on newspapers which do not sign up to the new regulator, said it was 
'laughable' for Hacked Off to pose as champions of a free press.

'You are not here to represent a free press. You're here to represent
people who on the one hand court publicity for all it's worth if 
there's a financial return for them but don't like the negative 
publicity that sometimes goes with it,' he said.

'You're here representing the Hugh Grants of the world. You are not here representing the free press of the world.'

Claims: (Left to right) Presenter Jeremy Clarkson, hairdresser John Frieda, billionaire Labour donor Lord David Sainsbury and philosopher Alain De Botton have all allegedly donated to Hacked Off. Mr Clarkson has denied it.

After pressure from campaigners all political parties must declare 
donations of more than £5,000, but Hacked Off appears unwilling to do 
the same.

The group later hit back saying that newspapers should stop lobbying ministers over the creation of a new press regulator.

Hugh Tomlinson QC, a leading member of the group which campaigns for tighter press regulation, said the newspapers had had the chance to make their case to the Leveson inquiry and should now accept its findings.

Anger: MPs called on Hacked Off to reveal who was donating to them

On the offensive: Brian Cathcart, Executive Director of Hacked Off, told MPs today that papers were abusing their power

Speaking to MPs today Hacked Off director Brian Cathcart accused some newspapers of an 'abuse' of their power in an attempt to protect their own position.

Mr Tomlinson, who was one of four Hacked Off representatives present at the late night talks where the deal was hammered out, said newspapers were not entitled to a fresh chance to influence ministers.

'We don't think they are entitled to lobby,' he said.

'There was a public inquiry where they were represented by a total of eight or 10 different QCs who argued their case, they have brought their evidence, the judge considered it, the judge came to his conclusion.

'We think that the press shouldn't have a second bite of the cherry trying to lobby ministers again with arguments that failed in front of the public inquiry. We continue to think that those recommendations ought to be implemented.'
