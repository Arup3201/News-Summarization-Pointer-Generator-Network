Andrew Clarke, 42, was jailed for stealing £100,000 from his employer to pay for daughters' education at the Royal School in Haslemere, Surrey

A father has been jailed for stealing £100,000 from his employer to pay for his daughters’ £21,000-a-year private education because he felt ‘pressure’ from their mother.

Andrew Clarke, 42, a financial controller, submitted a series of false invoices at F. E. Robinson Ltd in Hooton, Merseyside – almost costing the company and its 30 staff its business.

He had been using the money to send his two daughters to the Royal School in Haslemere, Surrey, which was founded in 1840 with Queen Victoria as a founder donor and its president is Princess Anne – a regular visitor to the school.

A court heard that he was only found out after his bosses became suspicious when he began taking holiday whenever external accountants came to check the figures.

Clarke, who has previously been jailed for fraud, pleaded guilty at Chester Crown Court yesterday to one count of fraud between May 2012 and August 2013.

Meirion Lewis-Jones, prosecuting, told the court Clarke had been hired by the managing director, Guy Williams, as a financial controller of the company.

He said the family-run company makes ‘tooling materials’ which are used by Airbus in Broughton as well as consumer products such as wood-burning stoves.

Mr Lewis-Jones said had a member of the Williams family not put in £150,000 to keep the company going, it would have gone out of business due to the fraud.

The managing director became suspicious of Clarke, who is from Merseyside, after working with him for about seven months when the accounts he produced seemed ‘too optimistic’.

An external accountancy firm was called in to look into the books and initially found nothing.

Mr Lewis-Jones said Clarke began acting suspiciously by taking holidays whenever the external accountancy firm was checking the figures and the managing director became convinced the firm was missing money.

It found Clarke had been giving in false invoices using legitimate suppliers names to the company with his bank details on, amounting to a total of £102,063.42.

Clarke admitted his guilt when arrested by police and also confessed to what he was doing when confronted by Mr Williams and paid back £8,000.

Mr Lewis-Jones told the court Clarke had previous convictions for fraud and in 2008, at Guildford Crown Court, he was given a community order for 18 offences of obtaining services by deception.

In 2009 he was jailed for 15 months for 31 offences of making false representations to make a gain and he had asked for a further 94 offences to be taken into consideration by the court for a total fraud worth £54,803.35 from a southern based accountancy firm.

Peter Barnett, defending, said the offences happened as Clarke felt ‘under pressure’ to continue paying his two daughters’ £7,000 per term school fees from his former partner.

He also spent £1,000 on his second wedding to a new partner.

Mr Barnett said Clarke had recently been diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum which meant, in his case, he was unable to tell the difference between problems - such as not being able to pay school fees - from a catastrophe which led him to criminality.

Judge Raj Shetty, said while Clarke may have felt ‘pressure’, the main motivation was ‘straightforward greed’.

His employers, F. E. Robinson Ltd in Hooton, Merseyside (pictured), and 30 staff almost went out of business because of the fraud, which amounted to over £100,000, and was only saved after a family member stepped in

He said: ‘Your job was to protect and advance the financial interests of the company but instead you stole its money.

‘This put the company in real jeopardy until the benevolence of a family member saved it.

‘I accept you co-operated with the police and your former employers and I accept that due to your autism you may feel pressure and stress easily.

‘But that is no different from what a lot of other people feel and you still know right from wrong.

‘The bank statements show you spent most of the money on entertainment and eating out. The main motivation in this case was straight forward greed.

‘You wanted to have an excessive and extravagant lifestyle and put at risk decent, working people’s jobs.’

Clarke was sentenced to two years in prison.

Following the sentence, Guy Williams, managing director of F E Robinson Ltd said: ‘It is hoped the sentence passed reflects the gravity of the situation and the fact that as a result of such actions, 30, skilled full time jobs from this company were put in serious jeopardy.’
