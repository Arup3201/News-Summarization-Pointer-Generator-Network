An outlaw who teamed up with his wife to help his jail-bird brother run a drug-trafficking operation from behind bars has also been jailed. 

Peter Burgess, 30, took instructions from his brother Lee as he served a five-year sentence for supplying heroin and cocaine. 

The father-of-three, who bizarrely posed in a Wild West themed portrait with his family before being convicted, enlisted the help of his wife, Sophie, to produce and sell drugs in Droylsden, Greater Manchester.

Taking orders from 26-year-old Lee Burgess in Risley Jail in Warrington, the group, which also included the convict's girlfriend, Brogan Dean, gathered more than £30,000 in cash before being arrested.

Peter Burgess admitted supplying cannabis, possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply, production of cannabis and abstracting electricity following a trial at Manchester Crown Court. 

He was jailed for five-and-a-half years while his wife Sophie was given a six-month sentence suspended for two years for conspiracy to supply cannabis and allowing her property to be used to produce the drug. 

The court heard how Burgess smuggled a mobile phone into his brother's jail cell to allow him to control the drug ring from behind bars.

Peter Burgess and his wife Sophie stashed money at their home as well as a large quantity of cocaine and cutting agents 

The couple were described by police as wanting to line their own pockets without putting in honest work 

With the help of his wife and his brother's girlfriend, he would produce and distribute the drug across Manchester streets and store the profits at home. 

In January last year police seized drugs paraphernalia and around £37,000 in cash at Brogan Dean's home. 

Two months later they discovered the remains of a cannabis farm at the home of Peter and Sophie Burgess as well as several thousand pounds worth of cocaine and cutting agents. 

Dean was handed a 12 month sentence suspended for two years and ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work, while Lee Burgess was jailed for two years 

Following their sentencing, Detective Constable John Harrop from Greater Manchester Police described the case as a victory for the community. 

After searching the couple's home and that of Lee Burgess's girlfriend, Brogan Dean, police seized around £30,000 in cash 

Risley Prison in Warrington where Lee Burgess was serving a five-year sentence for previous drug offences 

'It is clear from the volume of cash we recovered it was a lucrative enterprise and it was almost certainly the lure of easy money that persuaded Burgess to continue to pull the strings despite being locked up for dealing drugs,' he said. 

'Unlike the vast majority of people who work for a living, these four simply wanted to line their own pockets producing and peddling drugs and I am delighted this operation has been exposed and they have been punished for their criminal behaviour.

'It must be galling for people in our community to see drug dealers like this who can't be bothered to find honest work driving around in flash cars and enjoying the wealth criminality can bring so it's a victory for our communities as much as anyone else to see these people brought down a peg or two.'
