Fraud: Jodie Farrow, 24, admitted stealing from her grandfather when she appeared before magistrates

A grandfather was left heartbroken after his 'angel' granddaughter helped herself to his life savings.

Jodie Farrow, 24, stole £937 from a credit card belonging to Harold Evans, 75, and also cashed cheques worth £387.

Despite magistrates in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, being told the young woman is remorseful, Mr Evans said the trust has now gone from their relationship.

Farrow admitted fraud but was spared jail after a court was told she had promised to pay her grandfather back.

Speaking after the case, retired crane fitter Mr Evans said he was heartbroken to have been conned.

'I used to call her my little angel, we were so close,' he said. 'It only seems like yesterday I was bouncing her on my knee as a little one.

'I’d have done anything to support her but she’s ended all of that. She got in with the wrong people and changed from the little girl I doted on.

'We didn’t go to court, it would have been too difficult to see her standing there. I didn’t want her to go to jail but it is right that she was punished.'

Fraud: Jodie Farrow, 24, was given 200 hours unpaid work and ordered to repay the money

Magistrates ordered Farrow, of Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, to carry out 200 hours unpaid work and to give £1,324 back to her grandfather.

The theft almost completely wiped out Mr Evans' life savings, the court was told. However, Farrow still hopes that he will find it in his heard to forgive her.

But Mr Evans said: 'Now that the trust is gone it’ll be hard to move forward. She’s never even said sorry to me.'

The court heard Farrow was leading an 'ordinary life' working as a carer and building a future with her steady boyfriend.

But she lost her job and her boyfriend was later jailed and her life went into a downward spiral.

Probation officer Julie Norman said: 'She was left living in a flat by herself, with mounting debts which she did not want to discuss with family.'

Magistrates heard Farrow took the cheques on one of her regular visits to her grandparents Mr Evans and his wife Jeanette.
