As the U.S. loses its top-notch credit rating, consumers face rising interest rates and borrowing costs that may cost taxpayers billions of dollars.

Analysts warn the Standard & Poor's downgrade would increase the costs on everything from student loans to car payments.

The downgrade could also spread to a state and local level, pushing up the costs of borrowing funds for schools, roads and parks.

S&P cut the long-term U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+ Friday night on concerns about the government's budget deficits and rising debt burden.

‘The downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan (falls) short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilise the government's medium-term debt dynamics,’ an S&P spokesman said.

Foreign creditors such as China who hold U.S. debt will be concerned by the move

It follows a fierce battle in Congress over spending cuts and raising taxes to reduce the debt burden and allow the statutory borrowing limit to rise.

President Barack Obama signed legislation on Tuesday designed to reduce the fiscal deficit by $2.1trillion over 10 years.

But that was well short of the $4trillion in savings S&P had called for as a good ‘down payment’ on fixing America's finances.

The political gridlock and the failure to seriously address U.S. long-term fiscal problems came against the backdrop of slowing economic growth.

It also led to the worst week in the U.S. stock market for two years.

The S&P 500 stock index fell 10.8 per cent in the past 10 trading days on concerns that the U.S. economy may head into another recession.

There are also fears the European debt crisis has been growing worse as it spreads to Italy.

U.S. Treasury bonds, once seen as the world's safest, are now rated lower than bonds issued by countries such as Britain, Germany and France.

S&P said the outlook on the new U.S. credit rating is ‘negative' - a sign that another downgrade is possible in the next 12 to 18 months.

The impact of S&P's move was 
tempered by a decision from Moody's Investors Service this week that 
confirmed, for now, the U.S. AAA rating.

'It's not entirely unexpected. I believe it has already been partly priced into the dollar. We expect some further pressure on the U.S. dollar, but a sharp sell-off is in our view unlikely'

Fitch Ratings said it is still reviewing the rating and will issue its opinion by the end of the month.

‘It's not entirely unexpected. I believe it has already been partly priced into the dollar,' said Vassili Serebriakov, of Wells Fargo in New York.

'We expect some further pressure on the U.S. dollar, but a sharp sell-off is in our view unlikely.'

‘One of the reasons we don't really think foreign investors will start selling U.S. Treasuries aggressively is because there are still few alternatives to the U.S. Treasury market in terms of depth and liquidity.'

S&P's move is also likely to concern foreign creditors - especially China, which holds more than $1trillion of U.S. debt.

Beijing has repeatedly urged Washington to protect its U.S. dollar investments by addressing its budget problem.

The downgrade could add up to 0.7 of a percentage point to U.S. Treasuries' yields over time, increasing funding costs for public debt by some $100billion, U.S. securities industry trade group SIFMA said.

S&P had placed the U.S. credit rating on review for a possible downgrade on July 14.

‘The downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that Congress and the Administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics'

S&P statement

It was on concerns that Congress was not adequately addressing the government fiscal deficit of about $1.4trillion this year, or about 9.0 per cent of gross domestic product - one of the highest since World War II.

The unprecedented downgrade of the nation's AAA credit rating by a major ratings agency comes only 15 months before the next presidential election, where the downgrade and the debt will be top issues for debate.

Bitter political battles remain over the ideologically fraught issues of spending cuts and tax reform.

The compromise reached by Republicans and Democrats this week calls for the creation of a bipartisan congressional committee to find $1.5trillion of deficit cuts by late November, beyond the $917billion already identified.
