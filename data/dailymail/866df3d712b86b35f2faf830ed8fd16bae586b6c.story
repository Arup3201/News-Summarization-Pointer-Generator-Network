Pupils at a Christian school have been branded bigots after a young boy gave the wrong answer when asked what a Muslim was.

Durham Free has been told to close after inspectors branded it an educational failure and said some children displayed ‘discriminatory views’ toward people of other faiths. The boy’s answer to the Muslim question apparently included a reference to terrorism.

But teachers said the verdict was grossly unfair and based on a throwaway and ignorant comment made by a single pupil. They said the school’s Christian ethos made it an easy target for officials who wanted to show they were promoting the Government’s diversity agenda.

Closing down: Durham Free has been told to close after inspectors branded it an educational failure and said some children displayed ‘discriminatory views’ toward people of other faiths

A second Christian school in the area has been put into special measures. Inspectors also concluded its children were intolerant after allegedly asking ten-year-old pupils what lesbians ‘did’.

Teachers at Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland said the critical Ofsted report came as a shock because it was performing well. 

There are claims that some schools – mainly those with a religious ethos or in areas with few ethnic minority pupils – have been put under undue pressure by a requirement to promote British values such as tolerance, fairness, respect for other faiths and the rule of law and democracy.

The rules were introduced to combat extremism in the wake of investigations into the Trojan Horse takeover scandal in Birmingham.

Prebendary Rod Thomas, of the Reform Council and a member of the General Synod, said the plight of the two schools was disturbing.

‘When the future of entire schools can be prejudiced on the basis of what appear to be a few conversations with individual pupils, it raises very serious concerns,’ he added.

‘These two cases highlight important issues about how Ofsted are interpreting the guidance they have been given.’

Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute said: ‘The Government’s British values regime is twisting Ofsted’s priorities out of all proportion. Inspectors are asking all kinds of invasive questions and then issuing reports that the parents whose children attend the school don’t recognise.’

Durham Free School, which has 94 pupils aged 11 to 13, was praised by then education secretary Michael Gove after it opened in September 2013. But when it was inspected in November, Ofsted failed it on a wide range of factors including poor teaching, attainment and behaviour. ‘Standards are low and progress is inadequate,’ inspectors said. ‘Students’ achievement is weak.’

It will now close at Easter after Education Secretary Nicky Morgan announced her department was withdrawing its funding.

The inspecting team, which was led by Joan Hewitt, concluded: ‘Leaders are failing to prepare students for life in modern Britain. Some students hold discriminatory views of other people who have different faiths, values or beliefs from themselves.’

But according to teachers, the team based this view on speaking to the boy of around 12 who was asked about Muslims during a group discussion. His answer included a reference to terrorism. Acting headmaster Julian Eisner, 57, said: ‘The pupil’s reply displayed a very disappointing level of ignorance but, in the context, did not provide evidence of a discriminatory attitude.

‘The school wholeheartedly agreed with Ofsted inspectors that there is progress to be made to guarantee all pupils articulate and share the tolerant attitudes that are embedded in the school’s Christian ethos.’

Petrina Douglas, who is a parent governor, said: ‘It feels like the school has been made a scapegoat. Durham is primarily white British so knowledge of other cultures is not as prevalent. But I don’t think the children are bigoted.’

Chris Gray, principal of Grindon Hall, said: ‘It is now well known that the manner in which inspectors questioned our pupils in November was hostile, inappropriate and raises serious safeguarding issues. Ofsted’s approach to us was negative at every stage, as if the data collected had to fit a predetermined outcome.’

Yesterday, a Department for Education spokesman said of Grindon Hall: ‘This school has been troubled for some time and Ofsted have been monitoring it carefully. This report shows that problems persist and there are continued concerns about leadership, the quality of learning and safeguarding.’

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said of Durham Free School: ‘It is failing to ensure children are looked after, failing to provide an environment in which children are able to learn and failing to provide the quality of education that we expect.’  

Open: Grindon Hall, which teaches pupils aged four to 18, has a Christian ethos but no faith-based selection criteria, resulting in an intake that includes pupils from various religions
