President Barack Obama
says he's declining to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu during the
Israeli leader's visit to the United States in March because it
would be 'inappropriate' for him to meet with the prime minister two weeks before an election in that
country. 

Netanyahu's trip has become a diplomatic sore point with
political overtones on both sides. House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, invited the Israeli prime
minister to address Congress without informing the White House
or congressional Democrats.

Originally scheduled for February, the White House first said Obama would consider meeting with the foreign head state. 

But after Boehner acquiesced to a request from Netanyahu to move the speech to March 3 so that he could the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference in Washington, D.C., a spokesperson for the president's National Security Council said a reunion was no longer on the table.

President Barack Obama says he won't meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visits the U.S. in March because it would be 'inappropriate' two weeks before Israel's election

A meeting so close to Israel's March 17 election could be
seen as helping Netanyahu.

'I'm declining to meet with him simply because our general
policy is we don't meet with any world leader two weeks before
their election,' Obama said in an excerpt of a CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria released on Wednesday.

'I think that's inappropriate, and that's true with some of
our closest allies,' the Democratic president told Zakaria after pointing out that he speaks with Netanyahu 'all the time.'

Obama said he met with British Prime Minister David
Cameron in an election year because he scheduled his recent visit to Washington far enough away from
his country's election so 'that it doesn't look like in some
ways we're meddling or putting our thumbs on the scale.'

The U.S. president wouldn't comment on Boehner's invitation or Netayahu's decision to accept it, saying he'd leave that aspect for the two leaders to sort out.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said both men's actions were 'inappropriate,' however, and the Obama's spokesman said Boehner's speech violate normal 'protocol,'

Netanyahu's trip comes amid delicate negotiations
between world powers and Iran over its nuclear program. 

Some
U.S. lawmakers, Democratic and Republican, have embraced
Israel's skepticism on the talks and want to impose additional
economic sanctions on Tehran. 

A group of Senate Democrats sent Obama a letter on Tuesday saying they would hold off on pushing for sanctions for two months.

Netanyahu, whose relations with Obama are strained, has
defended his planned speech as a moral obligation and a
strategic necessity. He said on Sunday his priority was to urge
the United States and other powers not to negotiate an Iranian
nuclear deal that might endanger Israel.

'Our general policy is we don't meet with any world leader two weeks before their election,' Obama said in an excerpt of a CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria released on Wednesday

The Obama administration has said negotiations are crucial
to maintaining pressure on Tehran and hopefully achieve a
breakthrough by the end of June.

'For us to undermine diplomacy at this critical time for no
good reason is a mistake,' Obama said in the CNN interview.

Obama said he hadn't yer heard a 'persuasive rebuttal' to his argument that the current sanctions regime was created to force Iran into diplomatic negotiations.

So far, he said, Iran hasn't violated an interim agreement. 

'We have lost nothing during this period of negotiations,' he said, yet we have a 'chance' at making sure Iran doesn't develop a nuclear weapon.

The U.S. president again promised to veto any legislation that calls for new sanctions on Iran before talks have concluded and reiterated a commitment to further punish Iran 'the day after' it walks away from a 'reasonable' deal.

With Republicans now in control of the Senate, what makes the administration so sure that any deal it approves would also get the green light from the upper chamber.

'I think it's important for us to actually have a deal in place, and then make an argument for what the deal is,' Obama said, restating his position that he would take 'no deal over a bad deal.'

If he were to come to the Senate with a deal scientists say would stop Iran from becoming nuclear capable and Republicans still weren't on board, Obama said a public debate would ensue in which he would ask Members of Congress why they would 'prefer a potential military option that would be less effective in constraining Iran's nuclear program and would have extraordinary ramifications at a time when we've already got too many conflicts in the Middle East.'

'And I'm pretty confident I can win that argument,' he added.
