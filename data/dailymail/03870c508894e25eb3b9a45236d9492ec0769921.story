Finally, Sunderland have had a happy Monday. After 12 years and 21 games, they won a match on a Monday, clinching a vital win against Crystal Palace.

But while Gus Poyet enjoyed his start to the week, the same can’t be said of Neil Warnock.

The Palace boss left incensed after referee Phil Dowd failed to award his side what looked a clear penalty inside the opening 25 seconds.

Warnock is already in hot water with the FA over comments made about referee Craig Pawson following the defeat by Chelsea last month.

And he may find himself in further trouble after another rant after last night’s loss.

‘I think everyone knows it was a penalty, I think the only chance we’ve got of getting a penalty at the moment is if a player picks up the ball and throws it at the referee,’ said the Palace boss.

‘We are at Manchester United next, I don’t think we’ll get many decisions there. Major decisions change games and major decisions haven’t gone for us.’

There’s no doubt about it, Sunderland got away with one, and Poyet knew it too.

‘It was time for us to get a little bit of luck,’ said the Sunderland boss. ‘We’ve not had much so far this way. What’s important is that we take advantage of that luck and win the game.

‘It means a lot — it means more than anyone can think. It’s been a difficult couple of weeks.’

Spectators were still finding their seats as the night’s main talking point unfolded.

There looked to be no danger as Marouane Chamakh flicked on Scott Dann’s hoist forward, but as Sunderland hesitated in dealing with the second ball, Fraizer Campbell burst past John O’Shea into the box.

Santiago Vergini lunged but failed to make any contact with the ball before taking Campbell’s legs away from him.

Selhurst Park rose to its feet fully expecting a penalty, but Dowd waved Palace’s appeals away. Warnock was less than impressed. You can only wonder how he felt when he saw the replays. It was as clear a penalty as you’ll see this season.

In the aftermath, the Palace boss approached fourth official Mike Jones. Not long after, Dowd made his way over to the Palace bench for a word with Warnock.

Having conceded 10 goals in their last two games, Poyet would have been content to see his side on level terms after 30 minutes.He’d have been ecstatic three minutes later as Sunderland took the lead.

There was a hint of offside as Patrick van Aanholt collected the ball down the left — but as Palace appealed for a free-kick the Dutchman found Steven Fletcher, who leaped highest to plant a header past Julian Speroni.

Palace had a second penalty appeal dismissed by Dowd two minutes after Fletcher’s goal when Van Aanholt collided with Wilfried Zaha down the right.

Again, the Sunderland player made little or no contact with the ball. If Warnock was angry at his side’s first failed penalty shout, he was apoplectic with this one.

But in Dowd’s defence, replays showed that the tangle occurred just outside the box. The incident was Van Aanholt’s final contribution, as he was carried off after lengthy treatment following the collision with Zaha.

Palace’s predicament could easily have worsened before the break as the Black Cats were denied three times by Speroni; Fletcher, Vergini and Wickham all denied by the Argentine.

Ten minutes into the second half, Palace grabbed a deserved equaliser. Zaha was at the centre of it, tormenting Sebastian Larsson before standing up an inviting cross to Campbell at the far post.

The former Sunderland striker’s powerful header was brilliantly saved by Costel Pantilimon, but the keeper was helpless as Wes Brown diverted Campbell’s back-heel from the rebound into his own net from two yards.

But having dragged themselves back into the clash, Palace slumped to defeat after a miserable final 10 minutes.

Jordi Gomez smashed home a 20-yard drive in the 79th minute to send the travelling support into delirium, Mile Jedinak heaped further misery on the home side as he was sent off for a second yellow card for a foul on Gomez before Fletcher, put clear by Liam Bridcutt, added a third.
