An American aerospace company has developed a light-weight solar-powered drone that can fly at 65,000 feet for five years.

The Solara series, the largest of which measures 60 metres wide, are classed as a 'High Altitude Long Endurance solar atmospheric satellites capable of carrying telecom, reconnaissance and atmospheric sensors.'

The Solara aircraft is self-sufficient - it is covered in around 3,000 solar panels 
producing about 7 kW of electricity - it will fly above the clouds, so it
 would be exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours and store energy for the night flight.

New dawn: An American aerospace company has developed a light-weight solar-powered drone that can fly at 65,000 feet for five years

Capabilities: The Solara series, the largest of which measures 60 metres wide, are classed as a 'High Altitude Long Endurance solar atmospheric satellites capable of carrying telecom, reconnaissance and atmospheric sensors'

Self-sufficient: The aircraft has 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kW of electricity and would be above the clouds, so it would be exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours

Cruising speed for the Solara is about 65 mph, and the unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles, reports CBS Local Las Vegas.

The largest plane Texas-based company Titan Aerospace plan to build, is the Solara 60, which could carry up to 250 pounds of payload, such as  anything from signals intelligence gear or electro-optical sensors to communications equipment.

The Solara 50 and Solara 60 will be launched with a catapult, according to Flight Daily website.

Travel: Cruising speed for the Solara is about 65 mph, and the unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles

Capacity: The largest plane they plan to build, the Solara 60, could carry up to 250 pounds anything from signals intelligence gear or electro-optical sensors to communications equipment

Power: It is covered in around 3,000 solar panels 
producing about 7 kW of electricity - it will fly above the clouds, so it
 would be exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours.

Wingspan and payload: 60 metres wide. Carry a payload of 250 pounds

Costing : Estimated to cost in the region of $2 million.

Speed: Cruising speed for the Solara is about 65 mph, and the unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles.

Function:  Carrying out functions such as surveillance, crop-monitoring, weather and disaster oversight, or any other monitoring that low-altitude satellites track.

Distance: The unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles.

They are designed to be cheaper than the cost of a satellite, while carrying out similar functions such as surveillance, crop-monitoring, weather and disaster oversight, or any other monitoring that low-altitude satellites track.

One is 
scheduled for completion next year and could cost less than $2 million, according to Forbes, reports CBS Las Vegas.

The magazine quotes Dustin Sanders, Titan’s chief electrical engineer, as saying, 'We’re trying to do a single-million-dollar-per-aircraft platform. And the operation cost is almost nothing — you’re paying some dude to watch the payload and make sure the aircraft doesn’t do anything stupid.'

Titan’s website says it has orders for three of the Solara 50s and one of the Solara 60s.

Although they have not divulged who placed the order Breaking Defense website speculates the most obvious customers for the Solara in the defense and intelligence world would be the CIA, NRO and NGA.

Chief Technology Officer Max Yaney, told Breaking Defense, early discussions had been held with some of the intelligence agencies.

To illustrate how responsive the aircraft are Mr Yaney told the website that two planes could be positioned in a satellite orbit at either end of the United States and if needed in an emergency they could be repositioned to take photos, provide 4G cell coverage or help with mapping.

Pioneering: Mr Yaney said of the Solari series: 'This is the holy grail of edge-of-space access...'

Future: Chief Technology Officer Max Yaney, told Breaking Defense, early discussions had been held with some of the intelligence agencies

Functions: They are designed to be cheaper than the cost of a satellite, while carrying out similar functions such as surveillance, crop-monitoring, weather and disaster oversight, or any other monitoring that low-altitude satellites track

New beginnings: The Solara series differ from the more traditional drones developed such as the Predator drone, right,  which is powered by an engine, driven by a propeller, can fly up to 400 nautical miles (740 km) to a target, loiter overhead for 14 hours, then return to its base

Mr Yaney told Flight Global: 'We've been developing this for a number of years.'

'Obviously
 there are some very exciting programmes that have been attempted over 
the years. This is the holy grail of edge-of-space access.... We've 
taken the lessons learned from all of those programmes'.

'We
 make heavy use of the latest and greatest composite materials and 
advanced composite techniques developed over recent years,' Yaney 
continues.

'There are 
actually fantastic advances in composites that allow us to meet the 
strength and weight requirements. We employ the entire spectrum.'

The Solara series differ from the more traditional drones developed such as the Predator drone, which is powered by an engine, driven by a propeller, can fly up to 400 nautical miles (740 km) to a target, loiter overhead for 14 hours, then return to its base.
