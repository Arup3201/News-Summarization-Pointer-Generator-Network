The taxman will soon be taking more money from financially prudent savers, homebuyers and shareholders than from duty collected on alcohol and cigarettes.

By the end of the next financial year, the amount raised from inheritance tax, stamp duty land tax and stamp duty on shares is forecast to reach £21.9billion, according to Treasury figures.

This contrasts with £21billion set to be raised from ‘sin’ taxes on tobacco, wine, beer and cider.

Cigarettes and beer: The taxman will soon be taking more money from financially prudent savers, homebuyers and shareholders than from duty collected on alcohol and cigarettes.

Last night, backbench Tory MPs said the situation was a ‘mistake’ which would ‘have a dampening impact on aspiration’ - and called on the Government to make reforms, particularly to inheritance tax.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, Conservative MP for North East Somerset, told The Daily Telegraph: ‘We promised at the last election to increase the inheritance tax threshold.

'That was an extremely popular promise. I hope when we can afford it we will come back to that, and we should certainly be looking at whether you raise more revenue with lower rates.

'You should look at the dampening effect it has on aspiration. It hits people who do all the right things: who work hard, who save, who build up a nest egg for their families. They get penalised. That is a mistake.’

Before the last election, the Tories promised to increase the inheritance tax threshold from £325,000 to £1million but the plans were abandoned due to Liberal Democrat opposition.

Inheritance tax is levied at a rate of 40 per cent on the value of an estate above the threshold - and rising property prices are putting even more people in the firing line.

Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, told the newspaper: ‘The continuing increase in the amount of inheritance tax collected raises the importance of tackling this tax burden for many middle-income families.

‘Inheritance tax was designed as a tax for the rich, and is now paid by many middle-income families who have accumulated assets – usually their homes – paid for out of income that has already been taxed. I hope the next Conservative government will be a position to change this.'

'It hits people who do all the right things: who work hard, who save, who build up a nest egg for their families. They get penalised. That is a mistake'

By the end of the decade, the gap between the two types of taxes will have increased further still, the Treasury predicts.

Some £27.2billion will be raised from inheritance tax and stamp duties on land and shares, compared with £23.7billion from alcohol and tobacco duties, the Treasury predicts.

Last night, a Treasury aide said: ‘These figures were published in March at the Budget and while we are having to pay off Labour’s deficit, couples can still leave £650,000 tax free.

‘Importantly, freezing the inheritance tax threshold means we can pay to end the scandal of people having to sell their homes to pay for social care – meaning they often had no home to leave to their children and grandchildren in the first place.’
