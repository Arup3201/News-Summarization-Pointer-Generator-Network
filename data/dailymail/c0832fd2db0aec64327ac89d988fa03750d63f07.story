A British couple who survived the Costa Concordia sinking are seeking more than Â£1million in damages.

John and Mandy Rodford were among the last passengers to be plucked to safety from the stricken Costa Concordia, which struck rocks hours after leaving port for a seven-day Mediterranean cruise.

Both attended the trial today of the luxury liner's captain Francesco Schettino, who is accused of multiple manslaughter and causing the disaster which cost the lives of 32 people - with one body still to be found.

Traumatised: John and Mandy Rodford, pictured returning to the UK after the disaster in 2012, revealed to the trial of the Costa Concordia's captain that they are seeking a million Euros each in damages

Mr Rodford, 48, told the hearing at Grosseto: 'We have asked for a million Euro each in damages.

'Costa Cruises [the ship's owner] did not give us any emergency instructions when we left - instead something was planned for the following day.

''It is difficult to accept that the company is still operating and we are having trouble sleeping more than two years after the tragic events of that night.'

Mandy, 46, told the hearing: 'Costa Cruises needs to suffer as we have - we almost lost our lives.'

They described how they were initially told 'everything was under control' but then scenes of panic developed as the ship began to list, leaving objects to slide off tables and crash to the floor.

Because of the angle at which the ship was leaning, lifeboats could not be launched and they had to clamber back out of the first one they boarded because it would not deploy.

Stricken: Costa Cruises, which owned the ship, has already offered 17,000 Euros in compensation to each of the passengers and crew on board when the ship hit rocks in 2012 off the Italian island of Giglio (pictured)

The couple, from Rochester, Kent, were on the Costa Concordia to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary when disaster struck in January 2012 and were among 35 Britons on the ship.

Costa Cruises has already offered compensation of 17,000 Euros to each of the 4,000 passengers and crew who were onboard the Costa Concordia that night.

But many have slammed the offer as 'ridiculous' and are taking out individual compensation cases against Costa Cruises, which could end up costing the firm millions of pounds if they lose.

The trial has already heard how Schettino - dubbed Captain Coward for abandoning ship while passengers were still on board - is said to have deliberately steered his ship close to the island to show off, recklessly endangering lives.

Another survivor, Italian Tommaso Napoli, told the court that after the ship struck rocks he 'feared I would never see my wife and children again'.

On trial: Captain Francesco Schettino is accused of multiple manslaughter and showing off by sailing too close to the island - but he insists he was given out-of-date nautical charts. He faces 20 years in prison if convicted

He added that as he tried to reach a lifeboat he was 'bowled over by sea of people convinced they were about to die.'

Other witnesses told the hearing of the scenes of chaos on board the liner with confused crew ordering passengers to return to their cabins as there was a 'temporary blackout'.

Ohers were ordered to muster points in restaurants after the Concordia struck rocks off the island of Giglio.

Schettino denies the charges against him, and has insisted that he instead saved lives. His case is that the ship struck rocks because he had been given out-of-date charts.

Prosecutors want him jailed for twenty years and the trial is not expected to end until 2016 at the earliest, with hundreds of people due to testify.
