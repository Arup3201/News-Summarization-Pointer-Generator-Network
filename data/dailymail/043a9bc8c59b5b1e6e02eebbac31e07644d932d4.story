Two teenagers’ bodies were recovered yesterday after they drowned in separate incidents while cooling off in dangerous waters during the heatwave.

The tragedies followed another death on Tuesday, when a 13-year-old boy went into a fast-flowing section of the Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, to retrieve a football.

A high of 28.6C (83.5F) was recorded in the Solent in Hampshire yesterday, with other parts of the country seeing similar temperatures and occasional heavy showers.

The sweltering heat, which is due to continue today, coincided with the start of the school holidays – prompting the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents to issue a warning to young people.

Leisure safety manager Dave Walker said: ‘Even on a hot day, the water might be a lot colder or deeper than you were expecting, and there may be underwater debris that you cannot see.’

Rony John, 15, was found dead at 2am yesterday, ten hours after he got into trouble while swimming in the Great Ouse river near Hartford in Cambridgeshire.

Search teams then discovered the body of Conor McColl, 16, from Luton, just after 1pm. 

Conor also disappeared on Thursday, at around 6pm, after swimming in a disused quarry in Clophill, Bedfordshire.

Two other teenagers were rescued from the water.

Weak swimmer Rony had jumped into the river with fellow pupils from St Peter’s School, Huntingdon.

One girl at the scene said: ‘Apparently he couldn’t swim and he went in with a group of boys.

‘They all held on to him so that he wouldn’t go under and then he said that he could swim.’

The two tragedies today come just 
days after Arran Cooper, ten and Kyrece Francis, 13, died in separate 
tragedies earlier this week.

Schoolboy
 Arran, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, died in hospital in the 
early hours of Wednesday after he fell into the River Orchy, in the 
Caledonian forest reserve in Argyll and Bute, Scotland.

His
 death came less than 24 hours after 13-year-old Kyrece Francis drowned 
in the River Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire after apparently jumping 
in the fast-flowing water to retrieve a football.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution also urged the public to take care in the sea, after a 12-year-old girl and her 21-year-old brother had to be rescued on Wednesday.

The pair were nearly swept into the path of a shipping lane by currents in Ramsgate, Kent.

Thousands are being tempted to the coast as ocean temperatures have hit a seven-year high in some places.

The water has reached 20.4C (68.7F) off Start Bay in Devon – a full degree warmer than Santa Monica in Los Angeles.

Elsewhere, a mother who abandoned her baby in a boiling car to go shopping was cautioned by police.

Passers-by called the emergency services after noticing the child had been left alone in the Surrey supermarket car park on Tuesday, when temperatures hit 20C (68F) in the shade, The Sun reported.

Police gave the mother a caution for ‘wilful abandonment’. The baby did not require medical treatment.

Forecasters said the high temperatures would continue today – making Britain hotter than Crete – before falling by up to four degrees on Sunday.

Sun-worshippers who end up looking more like a lobster than a bronzed beauty can now get relief – using the first burn lotion containing ibuprofen.

The cream, called Soleve, delivers the painkiller directly to burnt skin.

In trials it was found to remove the stinging sensation for eight out of ten users.

The lotion, which costs £9.95 for 100ml, also contains the emollient isopropyl myristate, which soothes and moisturises the skin and traps in water, helping the body’s healing process. Surveys show three out of five Britons have suffered from sunburn in the past five years, and say it has blighted their holidays.

Other after-sun lotions currently available are simply forms of moisturisers and can do nothing to relieve the pain of mild to moderate sunburn.

Dr Phil Rosher of Diomed Developments, which created Soleve, said trials showed it helped to relieve pain, swelling, inflammation and tenderness.
