The England squad were treated to some samba dancing and a score prediction from a Brazilian youngster as the team travelled through Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday.

The cheeky youngster held his fingers up, clearly predicting England to win or lose '2-1' against Uruguay on Thursday before breaking into some samba dancing by the side of the coach.

Taking to his officila Facebook page to share the video, Oxlade-Chamberlain wrote: 'On the coach today on the way back from training... Have a look at this cheeky kid telling us the score and then pulling out the FIFA samba celebration at the end!!'

The Arsenal youngster will no doubt be in high spirits after completing his first full training session since suffering a knee injury on Monday.

Oxlade-Chamberlain had heavy strapping on his right knee and broke off from training with the rest of the group after around fifteen minutes to do some individual work as he builds his way back to full fitness.

Roy Hodgson will be hoping he can call upon Oxlade-Chamberlain sooner rather than later as England face World Cup elimination if they lose to Uruguay on Thursday night.
