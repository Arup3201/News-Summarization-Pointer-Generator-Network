The world's longest and widest multi-pylon cable-stayed bridge has opened in China after seven years of construction work

The Jiaxing-Shaoxing Sea Bridge stretches 6.2miles (10 kilometres) over the Hangzhou Bay, in Shaoxing, China.

It is mainly supported by two cable-towers, both of which reach 745ft in the air, and has a main body stretching 2,560ft wide.

Long cross: Jiaxing-Shaoxing Sea Bridge is the world's longest and widest cable-stayed bridge, and stretches so far in the distance the end disappears in the mist

The six-lane bridge opened to traffic on May 28th but the final tweaks were made on Monday.

The high speed bridge is designed for 
vehicles travelling exclusively above 60mph and pedestrians, motorbikes 
and cars with a maximum speed below 45mph are not allowed to cross.

It starts from the front part of Maqing Road in Haicang District in Xiamen and ends at Houzhai, Longhai in Zhangzhou.

A cable-stayed bridge has one of more towers where the cables are attached to support the bridge's deck.

Hard(hat) work: Electricians work on the Jiaxing-Shaoxing Sea Bridge earlier today in Shaoxing, China as it is finally completed

Held together: The 6.2miles (10 kilometres) long bridge is held up by two cable-supported towers, both of which are 745ft (227 metres) tall

They can appear similar to a suspension bridge, but its construction differs.

Before the construction of the 
Jiaxing-Shaoxing bridge, China already had three bridges in the top ten 
of largest cable-stayed bridges.

The top position was held by The 
Russky Bridge, in Vladivostok, Russia, with China's Sutong Bridge in 
Suzhou, Nantong in second place.
