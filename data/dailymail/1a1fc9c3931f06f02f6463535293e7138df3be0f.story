Pep Guardiola left the field in anger after his Bayern Munich side lost 2-1 to the MLS All Stars in an eventful friendly in Portland on Wednesday.

The Bayern boss did not shake hands with opposite number Caleb Porter, angry at some of the tackles by the MLS players at Providence Park.

US Soccer president Sunil Galati later tweeted that Guardiola did shake hands with Porter in the tunnel.

Galati tweeted: 'All good with Pep Guardiola and Caleb Porter. With them for nice handshake outside the locker room after the game.'

Robert Lewandowski scored a stunning first-half strike for his new team but Landon Donovan scooped the MVP award after scoring the winning goal. 

Donovan was left out of the USA squad for the World Cup by manager Jurgen Klinsmann but he seized his opportunity in the annual MLS All Star Game on Wednesday.

The match in Portland was Bayern's second and last on their summer tour having beaten CD Guadalajara 1-0 on Thursday in New Jersey.

The German champions will return home and take on Borussia Dortmund in the Super Cup on August 13 before kicking off their Bundesliga defence against Wolfsburg at the Allianz Arena on August 22.

Poland striker Lewandowski gave Bayern the lead in the eighth minute as his piledriver from the edge of the area left MLS goalkeeper Nick Rimando with no chance.

Substitute Bradley Wright-Phillips, who joined New York Red Bulls from Charlton in 2013, drew the MLS All Stars level early in the second half.

The former Manchester City and Southampton forward latched onto a through ball and smashed a left-foot shot past Tom Starke into the top corner in the 51st minute.

Donovan then made his mark on the game, snatching victory for the MLS All Stars with a deft finish past Neuer in the 70th minute.

Bayern ended the game with the likes of Neuer, Dante, Jerome Boateng, Philipp Lahm, Arjen Robben, Mario Gotze, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller on the pitch.

But Guardiola left the Providence Park pitch feeling annoyed at some of the tackles made by the MLS All Stars.

Bastian Schweinsteiger, who came on in the 80th minute, left the game just before the end after picking up a knock in a heavy tackle.

LA Galaxy striker Donovan told ESPN: 'I understand he doesn't want his players to get hurt. 

'They're not great tackles but they're not the worst tackles I've ever seen and I hope Schweiny's not hurt.'

Bayern Munich later tweeted that Schweinsteiger 'has a bruised ankle but nothing serious.'
