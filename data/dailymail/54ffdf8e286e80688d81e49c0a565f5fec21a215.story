A U.S. government website aimed at girls between the ages of 10 and 16 attracted attention its creators likely didn't want on Friday, as news emerged that it includes graphic information about sex acts along with advice about puberty and disease.

GirlsHealth.gov was spotted - and lambasted - by CNS News, a conservative website. But the government program was launched in 2002, during President George W. Bush's first term in office, and acquired its racy content during his second term, in 2006.

Historical versions of the website, kept available online at Archive.org, span nearly eight years and confirm that the graphic sexual language first appeared sometime between October 2005 and June 2006.

Today's GirlsHealth.gov is updated with a modern look, including social media tools and celebrity interviews, all calculated to appeal to girls - including the very young

GirlsHealth.gov's 'About this site' page describes it as a health resource website for girls as young as age 10

While many parents might want 10-year-old girls to know that sexual molestation is wrong, few would teach kids that young about 'mutual masturbation.' But the government-run website's glossary provides a frank definition

In language seemingly calculated to appeal to 'tween' female audiences, the government-funded website takes girls through everything from their first menstrual cycles to health issues related to homosexuality.

But the frank language in its 
glossary definition of anal sex - 'sex that involves putting the penis 
in the anus, or butt' - is likely to shock even parents who are used to 
seeing sex education programs in public schools.

Definitions of 'mutual masturbation' and 'oral sex' are also included in the glossary, aimed at millions of girls who have not yet reached puberty.

CONDOMS OR CRUSHES: Which is more appropriate for a fifth-grade girl?

Wanda Jones (L), then-Deputy U.S. Assistant Secretary for Women's Health, led the implementation of GirlsHealth.gov. Perot Systems, the computer company founded by billionaire two-time presidential candidate Ross Perot (R), won a $16 million contract extension in 2006 to continue working on that website and others

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded its first contract in 1998 to Soza and Company Ltd., a Fairfax, Virginia company tasked with building and managing a handful of health-related websites for the federal government.

Perot Systems Corp., the company founded by multi-billionaire and former presidential candidate  Ross Perot, acquired Soza that same year.

Perot won a $16 million contract in 2006 to continue the work - a contract that specifically mentioned GirlsHealth.gov. It was in that year that sexually explicit language first appeared on the site.

In a twist worthy of Hollywood, the personal computer maker Dell Inc. acquired Perot systems in 2009, meaning that the company millions of parents trust to provide their children with computing resources is also teaching many of their fifth-graders about anal sex.

Current Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius may be busy with pans to implement Obamacare: Her office didn't respond to questions about the GirlsHealth.gov website

Tommy Thompson (L) was HHS secretary throughout George W. Bush's first term in office when the website was launched. Mike Leavitt (R) took over the agency during Bush's second term, and was at the helm when the graphic information about sex acts was added

Wanda Jones, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health at HHS, was reportedly behind the development of the GirlsHealth.gov website. She entered federal government service in 1987, during the Reagan administration, as an HIV laboratory trainer and rose through the ranks, later being promoted to found the Centers for Disease Control's Office of Women's Health.

'We have nothing to sell but health,' Jones told a Voice of America interviewer in 2007.

She described the content on the GirlsHealth.gov website as 'U.S. government-source information, that ... can be trusted to be based on the most credible science.'

Neither Jones' office, nor that of HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, responded immediately to emails seeking additional information about the age groups targeted by the website's sexually explicit material.

Don't blame me - it's just another Republican trick!

It's all part of my global health 'strategery'

You know, I really wish I'd thought of that!

One online exercise helps young girls to dispel misconceptions about sexual activity by clicking on them to reveal 'the truth.'

One of those elements focuses on pregnancy prevention via the ineffective 'withdrawal' method.

'My boyfriend says he'll just pull his penis out before anything happens,' girls visiting that web page read.

Clicking brings them to a screen reading, 'The truth: It takes a lot of self-control for a guy to pull out. Also, some sperm can come out before a man ejaculates ("comes").'

Digital snapshots of the website 
maintained at archive.org show that in addition to descriptions of anal 
and oral sex, and mutual masturbation, when the website was updated 
between late 2005 and mid-2006, it acquired new information about date 
rape, ejaculation, sexual intercourse and a host of  sexually transmitted
 diseases.

No change was made, however, to the state age-range of its target audience.

The website's 2002-era feel was a cross between New Age and unicorns

Other new vocabulary, however, included sections on virginity and sexual abstinence. The Bush administration launched a major initiative in 2006 aimed at promoting abstinence-only sex education among late-teen and 20s audiences. At the same time, similar messaging began to appear on GirlsHealth.gov.

Some of that language is still available on the website. 'Few people regret waiting to have sex, but many regret starting early,' one section reads.

'Read on to see why abstinence - not having sex - makes a lot of good sense.'

Other sections, however, presume the very young target audience is already sexually active, even as they promote abstinence

The page containing that language, according to a notice on the website, was last updated in October 2010.

This helpful exercise, aimed at girls as young 
as 10, dispels myths about the withdrawal method of birth control during

A conservative website sounded the alarm, but the website and its graphic content came long before Barack Obama

Federal health regulators awarded a $16 million contract in 2006 to operate that website and others, to a company now owned by Dell computers
