Disturbing CCTV footage has emerged of the moment a man dragged his ex-partner to the ground and allegedly attempted to murder her as she started work.

Detectives believe the woman may have been killed if two police officers had not been at the Canungra Hotel investigating an unrelated matter around 10am on Thursday morning.

The hotel's security footage shows the man hauling the woman to the ground, assaulting her and pulling a knife.
