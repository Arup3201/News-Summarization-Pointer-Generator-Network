Britain and Germany were at odds last night over claims that UK spies run an eavesdropping centre from the roof of the British Embassy in Berlin.

Foreign minister Guido Westerwelle summoned the British ambassador to hear a formal protest about the snooping network allegedly operated by the Government Communications Headquarters.

The German Foreign Office said it had warned Simon McDonald that using a diplomatic mission to tap communications would violate international law.

Leaked US National Security Agency 
documents suggest the UK could be using high-tech equipment on the 
embassy roof to gather economic and political intelligence, according to
 The Independent newspaper.

Aerial photos show a white tent-like structure thought to have been in place since the embassy was opened in 2000.

Equipment
 in it ‘would be capable of intercepting mobile phone calls, wi-fi data 
and long-distance communications across the German capital’, it is 
alleged.

Germany said it had
 asked Mr McDonald to respond to the reports, based on documents leaked 
by the American whistleblower Edward Snowden.

A spokesman for the German foreign 
ministry said: ‘At the instigation of foreign minister Westerwelle, the 
British ambassador was asked to an interview in the Foreign Office.

‘The
 head of the European Department asked for a response to current reports
 in the British media, and pointed out that the interception of 
communications from the premises of a diplomatic mission would be 
behaviour contrary to international law.’

The
 British embassy refused to be drawn on the details of the talks. An 
embassy spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that meeting has taken place but
 we are not commenting on anything else to do with this at all.’

Downing
 Street insisted the ambassador had been ‘invited’ to attend a meeting, 
but the German Foreign Office said on Twitter that he had been ‘called 
in’, a less friendly form of words in diplomatic circles.

Spying
 by supposed allies is a sensitive issue in Germany after revelations 
that the US had listened to mobile phone calls made by Chancellor Angela
 Merkel since 2002.

A 
spokesman for David Cameron said the Prime Minister had not spoken to 
Mrs Merkel about the spying allegations, but insisted their relationship
 was ‘excellent’.

The 
spokesman declined to comment on security issues, but said Britain’s 
intelligence services operated under a ‘strong and clear legal 
framework’.

The allegations could cause embarrassment to Mr Cameron, who has strongly defended the UK's intelligence agencies in the wake of the Snowden revelations.

Last month Mr Cameron condemned ‘lah-dih-dah, airy-fairy’ criticism of the British and American intelligence services.

The
 Prime Minister said his fellow EU leaders should stop complaining about
 snooping by GCHQ and the NSA because British spies have saved their 
citizens from terrorist attack.

And
he accused whistleblower Edward 
Snowden and ‘newspapers helping him’, of giving assistance to terrorists
 ‘who want to blow up our families’.
