Crooked bankers could be made to hand back some of their pay under plans floated by Britain’s bank chief Mark Carney.

The Governor of the Bank of England said bonuses should not be the only thing regulators are able to ‘claw back’ if corrupt behaviour is uncovered.

Mr Carney said ‘standards may need to be developed to put non-bonus of fixed pay at risk’ as well.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney suggested regulators should be able to claw back bankers' pay and not just their bonuses

Mr Carney said fundamental change was needed to overhaul bankers’ behaviour in the wake of fresh financial scandals hitting the City.

It comes days after six banks were fined £2.6 billion after global regulators found traders had clubbed together to rig foreign exchange markets.

That came in the wake of the Libor-rate rigging scandal which had already cost firms billions in penalties.

Mr Carney said: ‘The repeated nature of these fines demonstrates that financial penalties alone are not sufficient to address the issues raised.

‘Fundamental change is needed to institutional culture, to compensation arrangements and to markets.

‘The succession of scandals mean it is simply untenable now to argue that the problem is one of a few bad apples. The issue is with the barrels in which they are stored.’

Mr Carney's warning came after David Cameron warned that the 'red warning lights' were 'flashing on the dashboard of the global economy'

In a speech in Singapore, Mr Carney said in some cases the link between those at the top of the bank who should have set out the ‘cultural norms’ among employees had been broken.

The public had been ‘rightly angered’ that leaders who had been responsible for ‘sowing the seeds of the crisis’ and allowing wrongdoing to develop had been able to walk away.

New measures to hold individual executives and board members to account as well as claw back bonuses after up to seven years are being introduced in the UK but Mr Carney said additional reforms may be necessary.

‘Senior manager accountability and new compensation structures will help to rebuild trust in financial institutions,’ Mr Carney added.

It comes after David Cameron warned  that the global economy risked another crash.

He said in an article that 'red warning lights' were 'flashing on the dashboard of the global economy' and the eurozone was 'teetering on the brink' of another recession.

Mr Cameron's warning follows claims by International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde has also expressed fears that a diet of high debt, low growth and unemployment may yet become 'the new normal in Europe'.

In an article in the Guardian, Mr Cameron said global instability such as the continued eurozone problems and the ebola outbreak threatened Britain's recovery.

He wrote: 'In six months' time, Britain will face a choice: the long-term plan that has seen it prosper, or the easy answers that would surely have seen it fail.

'By sticking to our long-term plan at home and standing up for Britain's interests abroad, we will do everything possible to protect our economy and give hardworking families a secure future in a Britain they are proud to call home.'
