Voices: Joseph L Nerone, 54, allegedly stabbed his elderly mother to death at their Chicago home

A man accused of stabbing his mother to death has blamed Satan for killing her, authorities said.

Joseph L Nerone, 54, was ordered to under go psychological testing after he was arrested at his home on Friday 'covered in blood'.

A neighbour discovered Nerone and the body of his elderly mother Elaine Nerone, 84, at the home they shared in Chicago.Â 

The victim had multiple stab wounds and several knives were found at the scene.

The alleged killer had minor injuries to his arms.

Nerone, who has a history of mental health issues, told officers that 'Satan did it and was inside of him', according to the Chicago Tribune.

The 54-year-old was being held at Cermak hospital after being refused bail by Judge James Brown today.

He appeared in court wearing a hospital gown.

A medical examiner ruled that Elaine Nerone had died as a result of stab wounds and blunt force trauma.

According to the Tribune, in 2010 Nerone was given 18 months of conditional discharge for attacking a neighbour while telling his victim: 'I'm god and it's your time.'
