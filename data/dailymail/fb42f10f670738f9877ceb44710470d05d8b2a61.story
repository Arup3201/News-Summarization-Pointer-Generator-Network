The story plays out like a Hollywood film – separated at birth, adopted by different families on two different continents, and the shock of discovering there was someone halfway across the world that exactly resembles them.

But that’s exactly what happened for suspected identical twins Anaïs Bordier, a French fashion design student living in London, and Samantha Futerman, an American hoping to break into acting in Los Angeles.

Now, the ‘twins,’ both 25, have started a Kickstarter page to fund a documentary to chronicle their first meeting and their subsequent adventures together – and, of course, they’re hoping to get a DNA test to find out once and for all if they are identical twins.

Sisters? The two young women have launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a documentary and meet each other in person

One of Ms Bordier’s friend’s first pointed out Ms Futerman in a YouTube video. Ms Futerman, an aspiring actress living in Los Angeles, then received a strange message from halfway across the world.

Ms Bordier wrote Ms Futerman on Twitter, saying that she discovered both of them shared the same November 1987 birthday.

Both were born in Seoul, South Korea, and they shared an uncanny resemblance.

‘I received a message via Twitter that would erratically change my life,’ Ms Futerman told Mashable. ‘At first glance, I saw only my own face staring back from “her” profile picture.’

Growing up: Bordier grew up in France while Futerman spent her childhood in New Jersey

Twinterest: The two will get a DNA test to confirm their relations, and hope to make a documentary together as they travel and learn about each other's lives

Ms Bordier was adopted by French parents and grew up as their only child outside of Paris, and knew that Ms Futerman grew up with two biological brothers in New Jersey.

The two first chatted on Skype – and can be seen in their Kickstarter video reacting to one another for the first time.

They also found a shared love of cheese, as well as ‘an apparent Napoleon complex.’

As of Wednesday afternoon, they have already surpassed their $30,000 goal, with more than $34,450 raised for their meet-up, documentary, and DNA testing.

More than 800 people have donated to their cause.
