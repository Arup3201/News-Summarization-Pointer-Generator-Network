Ed Balls embraced the prospect of a Labour coalition with the Liberal Democrats yesterday by declaring that Nick Clegg was a man of ‘integrity’.

In an apparent u-turn, the  shadow Chancellor said he understood why Mr Clegg went into government with the Conservatives and said they recently had a ‘very friendly and warm’ chat.

Mr Balls’ intervention indicates that senior Labour figures are keen to open the door to a possible deal with the Lib Dems after the general election next year.

Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls now says he could work with Nick Clegg, who claimed Mr Balls is the only politician he has a personal feud with

Thawing relations: Mr Clegg later posted a tweet saying only 'Ed Balls' - a reference to when the shadow sparked an internet phenomenon when by writing just his own name on Twitter

In an interview with the New 
Statesman, he said: ‘I understand totally why Nick Clegg made the 
decision that he made to go into coalition with the Conservatives. I may
 not have liked it at the time, but I understood it.’

He added: ‘I can disagree with Nick Clegg on some of the things he did but I’ve no reason to doubt his integrity.’

Mr
 Balls said he ‘had a nice chat’ with the Deputy Prime Minister recently
 about how things were going. ‘The only conversation I’ve had with Nick 
Clegg in the last 18 months was very friendly and warm,’ he said.

His comments are significant because he has previously stated that he would not go into government with Mr Clegg.

When the Tory/Lib Dem coalition was formed in 2010, senior figures in the Labour party were furious at what they saw as their natural allies on the left.

Mr Balls repeatedly criticised the Lib Dems and Mr Clegg in particular, claiming his decision to do a deal with David Cameron’s Tories was ‘shocking’ and would make it ‘very difficult’ to work with him in future.

But after the Labour lead in the polls halved to around six or seven points in 2013, senior party now accept that they could be faced with having to form a coalition in 2015.

The move to so warmly embrace Mr Clegg
 by one of Labour’s most factional figures will be viewed as a sign of a
 lack of confidence that Ed Miliband can become Prime Minister with an 
overall majority of his own.

A senior Lib Dem source also played down the idea of a long-lasting rift: 'It's no secret that Ed Balls and Nick Clegg disagree about a number of issues.

'But it's also true that they get on when they speak to each other. They are both thick-skinned and capable of having a joke at each other's expense in the rough and tumble of politics.

'But ultimately, they are more than capable of a friendly chat when they bump into each other.'

In a further sign of the thawing of relations, Mr Clegg later posted a tweet saying only 'Ed Balls' - a reference to when the shadow chancellor in April 2009 sparked an internet phenomenon when he wrote just his own name on Twitter.

The much-mocked gaffe became such a hit that two years later Mr Balls repeated it to mark the second anniversary of 'Ed Balls Day'.

November 2011'I don’t think there’s a single member of the shadow cabinet who’d find it easy to sit down with Nick Clegg. What Clegg did last year was so shocking'December 2011'I could serve in a Cabinet with Chris Huhne or Vince Cable tomorrow. I don't think it's possible for Nick Clegg to lead that move'

September 2012'Ed and I are both clear Nick Clegg is an obstacle'

January 2013‘I think what you always have to do is deal with politics as you find it. We’ve never, I don’t think, ever had a cross word.’

Before Christmas Mr Clegg claimed Mr Balls was the only politician he has a personal feud with.

The Lib Dem leader said: ‘I always try to keep a good sense of humour, and if I have an argument with someone to keep the argument about what the argument is about and not allow it too often to become sort of personal.

'I make one exception, for a man named Ed Balls. But other than that I try not to make it about insults and stuff.'

But in the latest interview Mr Balls brushed aside the criticism: ‘I saw that subsequently he made a further statement to one of the newspapers that these things weren’t about personalities, and I think he’s right about that.’

He added that he can ‘understand totally’ why Mr Clegg made the decision to go into coalition with the Tories.

‘I may not have liked it at the time, but I understood it. I also understood totally his decision to support a credible deficit reduction plan, because it was necessary in 2010.’

However he criticised the decision to accelerate the deficit reduction plane, cut the top rate tax cut and cut welfare.

Mr Balls added: ‘I can disagree with Nick Clegg on some of the things he did but I’ve no reason to doubt his integrity, we’ve never, I don’t think, ever had a cross word.’
