Two men have today been arrested by Jimmy Savile detectives on suspicion of sexual offences as part of Operation Yewtree.

The duo have been taken into custody after one was arrested at an address in Hampshire and another in west London.

The two men have been arrested under the strand of the investigation labelled 'others' as detective sort through hundreds of accusations made after the revelations about the late disgraced Jimmy Savile.

The pair have been arrested as police investigate accusations made in the wake of revalations about disgraced Jimmy Savile

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Officers working on Operation Yewtree have today arrested two men on suspicion of sexual offences.

'A 53-year-old man ('Yewtree 9') was arrested at approximately 8am at an address in Hampshire and taken into custody locally.

'A 59-year-old man ('Yewtree 10') was arrested at approximately midday in west London and taken into custody at a London police station.

'Both individuals fall under the strand of the investigation we have termed 'others'.

'We are not prepared to discuss further.'

Held: Ted Beston was arrested by police  and bailed

The force is leading the national 
probe into claims made against the disgraced TV presenter and figures in
the entertainment industry.

The
arrests come after former BBC producer Ted Beston 'vehemently denied' 
claims that he molested young women while working for Jimmy Savile.

Mr Beston, 76, was arrested by Operation Yewtree detectives in December last year on suspicion of historic sexual offences.

In
a statement released through his lawyers on December 20, the former 
Radio 1 producer said he was shocked by the allegations and had not 
known about Savile's revolting abuse.

The producer, nicknamed 'Uncle' Ted by Savile on air, was bailed until February.

Mr Beston, 76, was held at his home in Bromley, South London, at 6.30am and taken to a police station

He became a close friend of Savile’s while working for years as his producer on Radio 1 on shows including Savile’s Travels.

Beston is accused of procuring girls for Savile and other men to molest in the 1960s and 1970s.

Some women have also claimed that he sexually assaulted them himself.

He was the eighth man to be arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, the Savile sex abuse investigation.

Mr Beston produced several shows for Savile and also used his skills producing hit shows for DJ Mike Read and latterly Simon Mayo's Breakfast Show in the 80s.

At the time a police spokesman said: 'The man, who is in his 70s and from London, was arrested at 06.30hrs on 
suspicion of sexual offences and taken into custody at a south London 
police station.

'The individual falls under the strand of the investigation we have termed "Savile and others".'

In
some cases victims will not be identified or press charges. But in at 
least a dozen cases, police are reported to believe there is enough 
evidence for the celebrities to be arrested.

The
investigation has three strands, one dealing with allegations directly 
involving Jimmy Savile, the second involving allegations against 
associates of the disgraced DJ and the third involving 'others'.

Operation Yewtree has already cost around £2million and involves a team of 30 officers.

In December a man from London in his 60s was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences.

PR guru Max Clifford was arrested earlier on suspicion of sexual offences but was later bailed as part of the probe.

A man aged in his 80s from Berkshire was interviewed by detectives three weeks ago.

Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis and a man in his 70s, reported to be former television producer Wilfred De'Ath, have been arrested and bailed as part of the probe.

On Monday, Starr and Clifford were re-bailed to return on dates in February and March pending further inquiries.

Officers are looking at claims against Savile, those against Savile and others, and those against others.

Police revealed a total of 31 allegations of rape have been made against Jimmy Savile.

Detectives said they had received 199 complaints of sex attacks against the late BBC star from 450 different people.

Savile is said to have carried out the attacks in 17 police force areas.
