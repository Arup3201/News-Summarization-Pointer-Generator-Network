A key NHS target for GPs to refer everyone with cancer symptoms to a specialist within two weeks has failed to have any impact on survival rates, a shocking new study has found.

Despite being heralded as a way to boost the UK’s poor record on cancer survival compared with the rest of Europe, patients ‘fast-tracked’ to hospital are still having to wait for treatment after their initial appointment.

The study by the King’s Fund, an influential think-tank, also found that hospitals struggling to meet the target have been forced to delay treatment of cancer patients referred in other ways, for example after turning up at casualty with symptoms. 

Target: The fast track system sees patients with cancer symptoms referred to a specialist within two weeks - but the target has not impacted on survival rates

In some places, waiting times for breast cancer treatment have increased. GPs in some parts of the country are also referring too many patients along the fast-track route who later on turn out to be free of cancer, contributing to the delays.

The report found there was ‘no difference in survival’ between those referred along the two-week route compared with those referred in other ways and concluded the two-week target ‘cannot be judged to be effective’.

Lead researcher Anthony Harrison said: ‘The popular perception is this target has a more positive effect than it actually does – and politically it looks very good.

‘But the majority of cancers are still not being detected via the two-week target – most are being picked up after patients come into A&E departments with symptoms.

‘The fast track is just picking up a minority of cancer patients – about  25 per cent of all cases – but it appears to be causing delays for others. For patients, it is a huge psychological benefit to know they can see a specialist within two weeks and it would be politically disastrous to abolish the target. But maybe it could be relaxed to three weeks while also improving the time it takes to access treatment.’

Delays: Researchers said the majority of cancers are still not being detected via the two week target - most are picked up after patients present at A&E departments with symptoms

The target was introduced by former Prime Minister Tony Blair in 1999 and by 2010, 95.5 per cent of all patients referred this way by GPs were seen within two weeks by a specialist.

But the King’s Fund report said delays further along ‘offset the gains that the two-week rule is intended to produce’.

It also found that the proportion of patients referred via the two-week wait who were later found to have cancer had fallen from 13 per cent in 2007 to 11 per cent in 2009-10.

The report said: ‘This suggests that patient selection has worsened rather than improved in recent years.’

Sara Osborne, head of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Diagnosing cancer at an early stage has a huge impact on survival, and we hope to see further efforts made to ensure that GPs have access to the right training and resources to diagnose cancer quickly and accurately.

‘The Government is giving GPs direct access to diagnostic tests, which could reduce delays.’

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Earlier diagnosis is at the core of our £750 million cancer strategy and plays a vital role in our aim to improve survival rates and save an extra 5,000 lives every year by 2014.’
