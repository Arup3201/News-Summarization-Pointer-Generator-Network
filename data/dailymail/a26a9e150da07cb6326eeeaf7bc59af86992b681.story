Dog owners who are bored of playing fetch have a new way to make the everyday pursuit more exciting - a tennis ball cannon.

The K-9 Kannon helps kick walkies up a notch by adding real firepower to an amble in the park.

And it is also an ideal remedy for the lazy pet owner, as it takes all the effort out of throwing a ball around.

Device: The K-9 Kannon is designed to turn walking the dog into some sort of extreme sport

Range: The cannon can fire a tennis ball up to 100ft, making the game of Fetch much more fun

The innovative device costs Â£15, and is designed to fit tennis balls which it can propel up to 100ft.

Even more usefully, it features a hands-free pick-up capability so owners do not have to handle chewed-up, slobbered-up and dirty tennis balls.

Sarah Bell, director of marketing at Hyper Pet, said: 'The development process lasted over a year before the first prototype was ever produced.

'It was a collaboration between our product engineering and development department.

Take aim: The K-9 could be a dangerous weapon in the wrong hands... but thankfully it seems to be restricted to benevolent dog owners

Gadget: The cannon is designed by Hyper Pets, an animals accessories company based in Kansas

'Our primary goal is to bring new and innovative products to market that increase interaction and nurture the bond between pet and owner.

'And the K-9 Kannon definitely delivers on both!'

Hyper Pet, based in Wichita, Kansas, has been producing pet toys and accessories for over 30 years.

Man's best friend: But the cannon also allows you to pick up tennis balls hands free to avoid dog slobber

Easy: Dog owners need never tire themselves out with excessive throwing ever again

The K-9 Kannon recently won a 'Becker's Best In Show' award at the Global Pet Expo in Florida this year, which has led to a spike in demand for the device.

'It's something that owners of any age can enjoy, it inspires people to let loose and just have fun with their pets,' Ms Bell added.

'Our four-legged product testing team is still recovering!'
