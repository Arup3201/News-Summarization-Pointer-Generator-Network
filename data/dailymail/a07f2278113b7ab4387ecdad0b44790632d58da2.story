This is the moment a Metropolitan Police officer was caught on camera appearing to use a mobile phone while behind the wheel of a marked vehicle.

The policewoman was filmed apparently using a device while at the wheel as she waited at traffic lights in Hackney, east London, on Wednesday.

Passing cyclist Junaid McClymont, 24, said he spotted the WPC 'holding the phone up to her mouth' and purposely caught up with the marked police van to catch the incident on camera.

The young female officer was filmed apparently using a device (right) and 'holding it up to her mouth' (left) while behind the wheel as she waited at red traffic lights in the marked police van in Hackney, east London

He said: 'I was cycling through Hackney with my friend and the police van went past us. He realised she was on the phone and we thought "We can get them here".

'Luckily the lights went red so they had to stop and we caught up to them.

He said that it was at this point he filmed the footage which allegedly shows her using a mobile behind the wheel.

'She had no idea until I got to the window.' he added. It's hilarious.'

In the short video, the young policewoman can be seen holding an object - believed to be a mobile - just inches from her face.

He can be heard confronting her by saying: 'I just caught you on your phone while driving,' but she quickly denies any wrongdoing through the window and replies: 'I'm not on the phone, am I?'

Mr McClymont, a fitness instructor from Tottenham, north London, said: 'When she sees me, it looks as though she tries to hide it.

He added that it appears 'she's been caught doing what everyone else does' by lowering the object onto her lap out of view when confronted.

'Everyone thinks it's so funny that she's been caught,' he said.

Cyclist Junaid McClymont, 24, said he saw the policewoman (pictured) 'holding the mobile phone' before confronting her by saying: 'I just caught you on your phone while driving'. She responded: 'I'm not on the phone, am I?'

'I posted it because I wanted to say "You're not perfect, you're just as bad as everyone else".

'All the information is there, and if I wanted to, I could take it further.'

Mr McClymont captured the van's registration plate before he cycled away and is thought to be considering whether to report it to the force.

The Metropolitan Police confirmed it had been made aware of the footage.

A spokesman said: 'The majority of police personnel in Hackney borough work extremely hard and to the highest standards of professionalism to keep our communities safe. 

'When officers or staff fall short of these high standards, it is absolutely right that it is brought to our attention. 

'Senior officers at Hackney have been made aware of this particular incident and will take the appropriate action.'
