A student was left feeling sick when she opened a box of doughnuts delivered by Domino’s Pizza and found them covered in mould.

Chloe Smith, 20, and a friend ordered a pizza and the sweet treats - a recent addition to the chain’s menu - from a branch in Teddington, south-west London, following a late night study session.

But they opened the doughnut box and were hit by a stench, with all four covered in black mould. Now Miss Smith has insisted she will not be buying from Domino’s again after the nasty surprise.

'Mould and fur': Miss Smith has insisted she will not be buying from Domino’s again after the nasty surprise

She said: ‘At first we thought it might be chocolate chips but then the stench that come from the box was so overpowering. They were covered in mould and fur.

‘It’s amazing we weren’t sick. How could someone put that in a box and send it out for delivery? If I’d eaten one of those I could have been seriously ill.’

The manager of the Domino’s branch apologised and offered a refund to Miss Smith, a primary education student at St Mary’s University, Twickenham, who is from Dulwich.

She said: ‘I spoke to the manager from the store and all he wanted to offer was a refund, but that’s not good enough.’

A Domino’s spokesman said the matter was being taken ‘extremely seriously’.

She said: ‘Food quality is of utmost priority for Domino’s and we have strict processes and procedures in place for handling all ingredients and products.

‘We have asked that the customer contact us immediately in order for us to conduct a full and thorough investigation into this issue.’

Miss Smith has complained to Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council and environmental health officers are now investigating.
