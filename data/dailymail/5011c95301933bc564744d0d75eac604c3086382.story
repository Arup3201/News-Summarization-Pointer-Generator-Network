A teenager dressed as Slenderman was kicked out of a Oz Comic Con in Sydney for repeatedly touching members of the crowd.

Slenderman is a fictional character that originated as an Internet meme. The character is depicted as a gangly, unnaturally tall man with a white and featureless face, who invariably dons a suit.

It was responsible for a spate of moral panic earlier this year when it was linked to the stabbing of a 12-year-old girl in Wisconsin,as well as an arson attack by a young girl in Florida on her own family home.

Last week, a contingent of Wisconsin residents successfully demanded that local costume shops ban the sale of Slenderman costumes for Halloween.

Daniel Simao,who dressed Slenderman for the Sydney Oz Comic-Con last week, told Daily Mail Australia the costume appealed to him because of his physical dimensions, rather than the macabre connotations.

'I'm 7-feet tall and pretty gangly. Slenderman works for my build, plus it's a pretty easy costume. I just bought the Lycra skin suit and wore a black suit over the top. You don't need to do makeup or anything.

'I obviously didn't choose it because of the messed up stuff that happened in America.'

The costume was so convincing that at one stage, Stargate SG-1 actor Chris Judge ran from the stage he was doing a Q and A from because Simao began to approach. Security told Simao to leave as he was disrupting the session.

Simao says it was his first time attending Oz Comic Con, though he had been to similar events in the same costume without any difficulties.

'I've been to Supernova and EB Expo with the Slenderman routine. It was never a problem. Funnily enough I attended both days, but it was only on the Sunday that I was asked to leave.'

Simao was eventually kicked out by security for invading the personal space of members of the crowd. He said that while he did make physical contact with members of the public, he did not see it as inappropriate.

'I was softly poking people, pacing my palm on their shoulders then taking it away. I touched a couple of peoples hair. It wouldn't say it was improper.'

'For the most part, people were into it. Most of them asked for photographs aftrerwards or played along with it. They pretty much all freaked out.'

Simao said he was approached for photos by countless members of the crowd

Simao said he made physical contact with members of the crowd, however it was not inappropriate

Nonetheless, Simao regrets his conduct.

'I regret it because I don't generally like getting too much attention. About 90 per cent of the reactions online have been negative. The discussions sort of snowballed. It made me reconsider.'

Simao was warned at 1pm, when he found himself encircled by security.

'I can only see about four feet ahead of me in the suit, but when I took the mask off I could see they had surrounded me. They said I needed to stop invading peoples personal space.'

After that, he says he was closely monitored.

'I hung by the Dance Central stage for a few hours after that. I didn't touch anybody else, and I was still being approached for photos. Eventually the guards came up and said I wasn't following the instructions and that I had to leave.'

He believes the security overreacted, since he abided by their first warning. Simao added that he probably won't return to any other Comic-Con events, since anyone in a Slenderman costume will be 'discriminated against.'

'If it's the same security, I won't be going back. I'll be on their radar. It won't be much fun.' 

Simao said he regrets his behaviour because it garnered too much negative attention online

The event director of Oz Comic Con, Bernadette Neumann, confirmed that Simao was told to leave the event

The event director of Oz Comic Con, Bernadette Neumann, told Daily Mail Australia that a member of the crowd in a Slenderman costume was was asked to leave the event after 'inappropriate behaviour.'

'While management did not witness every single incident, the fact a number of complaints were made indicated there was an issue which needed to be addressed straight away,' she said.

'Oz Comic Con has a zero-tolerance policy on any form of harassment at these events. Anything that is reported to staff and security is immediately acted upon in the appropriate manner.'

Comic-Con events have a strict code on harassment. In July, a group of  San Diego Comic Con organisers pressured the country's premier fan convention to crack down on unwanted physical contact at the events, which is generally a prominent complaint.

In response, organisers at Comic-Con conventions in some cities have adopted tough anti-harassment policie, and an interactive Google map was created to collect and display the stories of harassment experienced by cosplayers at Comic-Con conventions.
