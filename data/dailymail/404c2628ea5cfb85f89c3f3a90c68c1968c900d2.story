Banned: Adam Walker has been prevented from teaching again after driving at a group of boys

An outspoken BNP activist has been given a lifetime teaching ban for chasing children in his car after they were verbally abusive towards him.

Adam Walker, who has been pictured on BNP marches with the far-Right party's leader Nick Griffin, had initially been banned for two years by the College for Teaching and Leadership.

However, Education Secretary Michael Gove has over-ruled that decision, and imposed a lifetime ban on returning to the classroom.

Walker, 44, has 20 years of teaching experience, having worked in Japan before returning to North-East England, where he taught at Houghton Kepier School in Sunderland.

He was given a six-month suspended prison sentence and lost his licence for 12 months after he pleaded guilty to dangerous driving at Durham Crown Court.

At a St George's Day celebration in 2011 at Tudhoe, near his home town of Spennymoor in County Durham, Walker was abused by three boys aged between 10 and 12, the court heard.

He chased the children in his car, then slit the tyres on their bikes with a Stanley knife.

Recorder Ben Nolan said that his actions were extremely dangerous, and claimed he could have killed the boys.

When the teaching council imposed a ban, it said: 'He had been provoked, but his reaction failed to meet up to the high standard expected of a teacher both in and out of school.'

'Vendetta': Walker, right, insists his teaching ban is politically motivated and not based on his crime

However, Walker insisted that the punishment imposed on him by Mr Gove was excessive, and the result of a 'personal vendetta' based on his controversial political beliefs.

'Clearly the Secretary of State has an axe to grind,' he said. 'I was dealt with first by the courts, then the teaching council, and accepted their decisions, but the Secretary of State has overruled all that.

'When I compare the punishments given to other teachers, including proven paedophiles and the like, what's happened to me seems totally disproportionate.'

In his judgement for the Secretary of State's office, Alan Meyrick said: 'Mr Walker's convictions involved threatening behaviour and criminal damage of a serious nature aimed at children.

'The reputation of the profession would be seriously damaged by allowing a teacher with this combination of convictions to be able to teach again.'
