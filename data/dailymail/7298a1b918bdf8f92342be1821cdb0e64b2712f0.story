First they hired supermodels to model their Spring Summer range, and now Tesco's F&F hold a star-studded fashion show for Autumn Winter 13.

The once upon a bargain brand, the supermarket label have upped their game yet again with an impressive show for their winter season offering following on from a restyle for SS.

Last season's model Jon K, a high fashion name who's worked with Tom Ford on numerous campaigns and won many modelling awards, returned for a spectacular runway appearance.

Red hot model Jon K modelled their SS13 collection and now walks for AW13. He has won countless awards

The front row was studded with glamorous celebrity faces, including rugby hunk Thom Evans and his stunning new girlfriend, 90210's Jessica Lowndes.

Denise Van Outen was also seen sitting front row, along with Lauren Pope. They both looked super stylish in monochrome ensembles.

F&F say of their collection: 'The season that lies ahead symbolises bravery and a carefree attitude.'

'We see the F&F woman come full circle from ladylike chic to rebel with a cause; a smart, independent, modern woman with a desire to challenge the ordinary and tear up the rule book.'

They paired chunky maroon knitwear with a fur trim wool coat and leather leggings.

An alternative take on styling the LBD, they accessorised a sexy bodycon number with sheer panelling around the bust with chunky boots and leather glove.

Black palazzo pants featured heavily, paired fine cream shirts or tangerine blouses.

Sea hues of moss and azure featured on skirts and fur coats paired with that same chunky pair of boots.

'Wear these pieces how you want, where you want and be confident about your choices; it’s an empowering feeling.'

'This season, the F&F woman sees a juxtaposition of texture and fabric across style pieces that embody the dynamism of the grunge luxe of the 90s and the daring silhouettes of the 40s. '

A men's collection features in similar hues and patterns, plus sportier jackets like parkas and bombers

'The F&F man redefines traditional formalwear with a sophisticated, smart selection of head-to-toe looks with details that make for a polished aesthetic whilst breaking the rule.'

'For the stylish men and professionals who are looking for the combination of exquisite fit and style; high quality suiting and complimentary accessories embody an irreverent take on heritage prep that looks distinctly youthful.'

While it can be straightforward enough to go luxe for Spring Summer, the real test of a brand restyle must be Autumn Winter.

Fabric is heavier, quality is more important to keep out chills, while keeping us cosy and comfortable - but clothes still need to look polished and sophisticated.

F&F have turned out a simple and sophisticated collection with a punky edge - and some real hero pieces.

A shearling coat, black sheer panel dress and leather panel pencil skirt will be versatile and won't ever age.

A pair of nice-enough chunky boots were used a tad too much in terms of styling - a pair of slick stilettos or even sophisticated boots would have worked better with the bodycon dress.

Menswear impressed equally with fitted tailored suits done well  and quirky styling with sporty coats.
