Sending a manned mission to Mars is 'necessary if the human race is to survive', Nasa chiefs have said.

It comes as they announced ambitious plans to land on the planet by 2030.

Speaking at the Humans to Mars summit in Washington, head of the US space programme Charles Bolden, said: 'If this species is to survive indefinitely we need to become a multi-planet species, we need to go to Mars, and Mars is a stepping stone to other solar systems.'

Nasa plans to capture an asteroid by 2015 and take it into the moon's orbit.

Astronauts
 making the journey to their captive space rock will hitch a ride on the
 next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, which will also be 
used for trips to the Moon and Mars.

Up
 to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid, compared to the maximum
 three in Apollo, in a trip that utilises both solar power and the 
moon’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft , according to the 
video.

Once
 the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the 
crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the 
conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take 
photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows.

Once in orbit, astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the Orion spacecraft by as early as 2021.

Mr Bolden revealed plans for the series of 'stepping stones' to the red planet, which included 'lassoing' an asteroid, The Times reports.

It also included growing plants in space, and using 3D printers for onboard repairs.

Nasa plans to capture an asteroid by 2015 and take it into the moon's orbit, send a spaceship to it and collect samples before returning home in less than a month round trip.

In an effort to attain a better understanding of asteroids, meteors and other near-space objects, the space exploration arm of the U.S. government plans to capture an asteroid, fly a crew to it in a next-generation spacecraft, take samples and return home to a splashdown in the ocean.

Nasa is developing the capabilities needed to capture an asteroid by 2015 and send humans to Mars by 2030

Funding for the project is included in the space agency’s upcoming budget, and details of the asteroid mission were outlined in a video released by Nasa last year.

It revealed that astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock will hitch a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, which will also be used for trips to the Moon and Mars.

Up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid, compared to the maximum three in Apollo, in a trip that utilises both solar power and the moon’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft , according to the video.

Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows.

Using a combination of solar power and gravity-aided thrust, the Orion will make the 10 day trip to the asteroid

Though it bares a resemblance to the earlier Apollo, Orion can hold more crew and is far-more advanced

Once in orbit, astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the Orion spacecraft by as early as 2021.

Once the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loop around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video.

Announced in the aftermath of the asteroid that exploded over Russia last year, injuring well over 1,000 people, Nasa plans to dedicate $100 million (£60 million) to this project in the coming year, the agency said.
