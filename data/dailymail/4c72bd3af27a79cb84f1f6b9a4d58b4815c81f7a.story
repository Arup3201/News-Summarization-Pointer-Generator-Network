Nurse: Genene Jones was convicted of murdering 15-month-old Chelsea McClellan in 1984, two years after she injected her with a lethal dose of muscle relaxant

A nurse convicted of the murder of a baby in 1984 and suspected of killing up to 46 more under her care will be released from prison after serving just one third of her 99-year sentence, it emerged today.

Genene Anne Jones, 63, may be released from prison as soon as 2018 because of an expired Texas law that grants a 'mandatory release' to inmates with good behavior.

Jones was convicted of murdering 15-month-old Chelsea McClellan in 1984, two years after she injected her with a lethal dose of muscle relaxant while she was still in her mother's arms in hospital.

Petti McClellan told ABC: 'I was holding Chelsea, she was facing 
me, and Jones gave her the first shot in her left thigh.

'Immediately 
Chelsea had trouble breathing. Chelsea was trying to say my name, but 
she couldn't. I was extremely upset.'

Jones was sentenced to 99 years in jail along with a 60-year sentence for injuring another child, who survived, which she was ordered to serve concurrently.

Ron Sutton, the criminal prosecutor who 
won the murder conviction, estimates that Jones is responsible for the 
deaths of between 11 and 46 infants in Bexar County from 1978 and 1982.

Cheryl Pendergraph worked at Bexar County Hospital with Jones after she was hired in 1977. She was a shift supervisor and gave patients assignments to nurses.

In 1981, she - and other nurses - began to notice a significant increase in the unit's infant mortality rate and when she looked at the patient logbooks she noticed a distinct and unsettling pattern.

'Most of the deaths were on the 3-11 
shift, which was the shift that Genene Jones worked on,' she told ABC. 'And most of the 
infants who died were Genene's patients. She was assigned to them.'

Petti McClellan and a number of others opposed to Jones being released are trying to find more of her alleged victims to prevent her release.

They are appealing to parents whose children died or became more ill in the hospital - now known as University Hospital of San Antonio - in the four years she worked there to come forward.

'Just the idea of a serial killer walking free in the United States of America is the craziest thing I have ever heard of,' she said.

'This is going to happen. There is 
nothing we can do. Nothing I can do,' Petti McClellan, continued. 'This 
has nothing to do with the parole board, the courts. Genene Jones is 
going to walk free.

'It makes no rhyme or reason. Not just for me and my family, but anybody who suffered. There were so many other victims.

'I truly feel it in my heart that this 
is something I have to do,' McClellan said. 'How does it make me 
different from her if I don't do anything?'

Jones will be released because of a Texas law called Mandatory Supervision which was enacted in 1977. It allows all convicted criminals to be automatically released on parole after they complete a certain amount of calendar time and if they have behaved well, and participated in certain work programs.

Her projected release date according to the website is February 24, 2018. She will have served just one third of her sentence.

Medical facility: Jones is suspected of murdering up to 46 babies while she was a nurse at Bexar County Hospital - now The University Hospital of San Antonio - from 1978 - 1982

The 63-year-old is currently being held in the Carole S. Young Medical Facility, a correctional center in Dickinson, Texas.

A Facebook group called 'Victims of Genene Anne Jones' has been set up and currently has 60 members.

Joann Garza, the group's administrator, had a twin brother her family believes was killed by Jones.

Baby Joel was taken to Bexar County Hospital after he choked on his bottle and, according to Garza, was given shots by Jones along with two unidentified twin girls. All three children died.

The hospital have not responded to requests for comment.
