He already has the most hardware of any Olympian, but is Michael Phelps on his way to the boob tube?

The Olympic swimming sensation, who is hoping to build on the sensational 19 medals he has won in the pool, has made no secret about the fact that he plans to retire after the London games.

Though Phelps hasn't divulged post-retirement plans, America's top TV networks are reportedly falling over themselves hoping to land Teams USA's golden boy as a sports commentator.

Most wanted: Michael Phelps could make millions after his retirement from swimming if he becomes an Olympics analyst for networks like NBC and ESPN

TMZ reports that NBC, ESPN and ABC are preparing to capture Phelps as a future Olympics commentator with huge contracts that could be worth millions - in a possible bidding war.

While the networks try to woo Phelps with dollar signs, there is only one thing on the swimming champ's mind: His final race today with rival Ryan Lochte.

Their first showdown of the London Olympics went to Lochte in a runaway on the opening night of the swimming competition. This one figures to be a lot closer.

The U.S. stars will compete against each other for the last time in the 200-meter individual medley tonight.

Lochte qualified fastest in 1 minute, 56.13 seconds. Phelps was 98-hundredths of a second back in third.

'We love racing against each other,' said Phelps, who plans to retire after the games. 'Neither one of us likes to lose. I like to say we bring out the best in one another.'

In between them again is Laszlo Cseh of Hungary. He's been the perennial also-ran in the last two Olympics, taking bronze behind Phelps at the 2004 Athens Games and silver four years ago in Beijing when Phelps won and Lochte was third.

Phelps could accomplish one more bit of history on Day 6 at the pool.

A victory would make him the first male swimmer to win an individual event in three consecutive Olympics.

Japanese star Kosuke Kitajima failed to defend either of his titles in the 100 or 200 breaststrokes, leaving Phelps a chance to accomplish the feat.

He missed on his first two tries at a three-peat, finishing fourth in the 400 IM (Lochte won) and second in the 200 butterfly.

Lochte has a busy schedule on what could be a big night for the U.S.

He'll try to defend his title in the 200 backstroke final, with teammate Tyler Clary pressuring him as the fastest qualifier. Then a short time later, Lochte returns for the 200 IM final.

Though friends, the two have sparked a rivalry in the pool, with many Americans split on who to support.

But Phelps appears to have one backer that Lochte does not - the leader of the free world.

Phelps, still reeling from the previous day's tweet, described the call as 'pretty cool'.

'I answered the phone and the voice said "Michael?" "Yes." "Please hold for the President of the United States,"' he told reporters today, after qualifying for the 100-meter butterfly semi-final.

'I was like, "wow."'

The president, he said, told Phelps the country was supporting him and proud of his performance.'He finished by saying 'make sure you tell your mom I said hi'.'

Phelps' mother Debbie, who raised Phelps and his two sisters single-handedly, is considered to be a great contributor to his success, helping him with his hyperactivity, and egging him on from the stands at every meet.

The U.S. team continued its strong showing with victories yesterday by Nathan Adrian in the 100 free and the team of Missy Franklin, Dana Vollmer, Shannon Vreeland and Allison Schmitt in the 4x200 free relay on Wednesday.

Adrian won a thrilling race that came down to the end. He got to the wall one-hundredth of a second ahead of James 'The Missile' Magnussen of Australia, becoming the first American to win the 100 free since Matt Biondi at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
