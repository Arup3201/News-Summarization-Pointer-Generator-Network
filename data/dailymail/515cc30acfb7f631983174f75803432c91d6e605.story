Leicester have made a £1million offer for Cardiff striker Fraizer Campbell and hope to seal a deal this weekend.

The Bluebirds are keen to keep the 26-year-old, but a move back to the Premier League will surely tempt Campbell.  

The Foxes have already snapped up Brighton defender Matthew Upson and Aston Villa's Marc Albrighton as they look to strengthen their squad ahead of the Premier League season.

Cardiff chairman Mehmet Dalman told BBC Sport: 'Fraizer's done fantastically for us, not just this season but the previous season.'

'He's very much loved at the club and we want him to stay.'

Nigel Pearson's side have also signed Manchester United youngster Jack Barmby on a two-year deal from July 1.
