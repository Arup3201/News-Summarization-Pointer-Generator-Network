Staff at a percussion shop in Wisconsin couldn't believe their eyes when this woman sat at a drum kit and gave them an impromptu performance.

'We’re still in disbelief this happened…' the staff posted on their own website, accompanied by a video of the show.

To people's amazement, the woman stepped into the shop, sat down and just started playing.

Mary the drumming granny shocked onlookers and staff when she sat down at a drum kit in a music shop in La Crosse, Wisconsin

Getting into the swing of it, she even starts to spin her sticks

Rocking out several different beats and rhythms, she looks to be thoroughly enjoying the attention.

She even spins the drum-sticks, to whoops from her audience.

The video, posted on youtube.com by the shop staff, says: 'Say hi to Mary, the Grandma Drummer!'

The post points out she is playing a Gretsch Catalina Birch kit with a 5.5x14 Gretsch Brooklyn snare and Zildjian cymbals.

As she shows off her skills onlookers can be heard whooping her on

There's no stopping the white-haired drummer as she bashes out lots of different beats and rhythms

The Coalition Drum Shop, in La Crosse, Wisconsin, sells drums and percussion, as advertised in the video by drumming Mary.

The video has since been picked up by online media site Hypervocal.com, which praised the 'young lady's' talents.
