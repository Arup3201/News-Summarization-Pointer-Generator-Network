Eight months since qualification and Steven Gerrard feels England are ready. ‘It’s time to walk the walk,’ says the captain, game-face on, at ease with his leadership responsibilities.

There will be butterflies in the bellies in the dressing room in Manaus. Young players at their first World Cup like Jordan Henderson will look up, see Gerrard and feel better that he is the man who will lead them on to the pitch.

‘It is here now,’ said Gerrard. ‘All the distances and the miles we have covered, the heat preparation, we’ve done all that. There are no excuses now. It is time to walk the walk. In every tournament, the FA leave the players with no excuses and maybe it’s 99.9 per cent right. This time they’ve put everything in place and done everything possible for the players to perform.

Time to perform: Steven Gerrard says there will be no excuses for England when they face Italy on Saturday night

Talking tactics: Roy Hodgson and Gerrard investigate the pitch in Manaus ahead of the game

‘When the whistle goes against Italy, you are on your own. You are with your team, your squad, and you have to have belief in what we are going into the tournament with. I think we are in a good place.’

The six months since the draw, which threw England into Group D with Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, have been encouraging. Italy have not won a game and Uruguay’s Luis Suarez has had knee surgery.

And Roy Hodgson’s team has evolved, refreshed with youngsters. No 1 goalkeeper Joe Hart reclaimed his place at Manchester City and centre forward Daniel Sturridge has been prolific.

‘This is the most difficult and the most pressurised stage to deliver on, both personally and as a group,’ said  Gerrard. ‘It is all right having all the ability and talent, but it is also being cute, clever and having that knowledge of how to beat these sides.

‘Everyone has a good blend of players, everyone will think they’ve prepared right and then it boils down to who wants it the most; who gets the small details right; who has that bit of luck.

‘Are we going to be lucky? Will the small details and the referee decisions go our way? We will have to wait and see. All we can control we have done. It is not just about the 11. A lot of things around can be big factors. We have a good staff, it’s like a tree with Roy and Ray Lewington at the top and down to the pillars in the dressing room, experienced players who have been there.

Pivotal: But Gerrard conceded that the 'fearless' England youngsters will need guidance

‘No doubt about it, these young lads are going to need a bit of guidance.

‘There will be times when they help us with a bit of energy or legs or a sprint back and that is why it becomes so important that everyone pulls together.

‘The confidence and belief we would get if we do get the right result could be massive. We have to be clever and cute. People talk about playing the Liverpool way, but to go to Manaus and play the Liverpool way may not be possible.

‘We have a game plan to attack with confidence and belief. One of Roy’s main strengths is having a team that is well organised. That will never change, but it is the players’ responsibility to get the transition right; when to be bold and brave and attack and go for the jugular and when to stick together.’

It is 40 days since Liverpool’s title bid unravelled at Crystal Palace. A week earlier, it was Gerrard’s slip which allowed Demba Ba to put Chelsea on course for a victory which would change the destiny of the title. ‘What happened against Chelsea was a setback for me,’ said Gerrard. ‘But when you play at the top you’re under pressure every game. I am going to make a big mistake from time to time. I am human. I am normal.

Team spirit: The England players have prepared well for their game, which will be hot and humid

‘I haven’t been too hard on myself. It drove me mad for a few nights.

‘I would rather be in the position to  be shot down than be underneath the level of the Premier League and international football. I would much rather be out there and take the responsibility.

‘I’ve moved on. I’m in a great place mentally and physically. I feel strong and I believe I can perform. My form over the whole season got stronger and stronger. Certainly when I moved back into the controlling role it’s been up there with some of the best football I’ve played.’

Gerrard will win his 112th cap against Italy and can break David Beckham’s record of 115 appearances as England’s most-capped outfield player — if they make it into the knock-out rounds.

‘From an international point of view, this is the pinnacle but I would be very selfish if I was sitting here thinking about my own caps rather than how the team is going to perform,’ he added.

‘I will probably say something in the dressing room. It will be a message to say, let’s not have any regrets. Let’s relax and let it happen.’
