A former NFL player being sued by his insurance company after he took part in Survivor even though he has a disability rating says he was able to get through the show with 'pain medication'.

Ex-defensive tackle Brad Culpepper received $175,000 in workers' compensation two years ago before his appearance in the reality series in 2013 alongside his wife Monica. 

The 46-year-old, who started his professional career with the Minnesota Vikings, told doctors he had 'low back pain and stiffness which is almost always present'.

However California-based Fairmont Premier claim Culpepper, who is now a personal injury attorney, 'willfully and deceptively provided false information' to the medical professionals who examined him.

They watched him perform a number of physically challenging tasks during the show - including lifting heavy crates, paddling canoes. 

According to a lawsuit seen by ABC News, the University of Florida graduate said he had 'quite a bit of difficulty... getting into or out of the bath and performing heavy activities around his home.'

He then went on to describe a list of injuries from head to knee traumas as well as vision problems.

However the insurance company contends that he is 'exquisitely fit and conditioned' and 'not disabled'.  

He told the station: 'I was on pain medication, and I had a back procedure right before that.

'Just because I chose to do things that are contra [sic] to my body, doesn't mean I'm not in pain, and doesn't mean I'm not impaired.'

Culpepper played nine seasons in the NFL after graduating from the University of Florida. 

He was picked in the 10th round in the 1992 and would become a regular starter for the Vikings, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Chicago Bears. 

Following his retirement he became an injury lawyer in Tampa Bay, Florida, and has slammed the case against him as 'ludicrous'.

Anger: During a TV interview, which is set to be broadcast on Monday evening, Culpepper ripped off his shirt in frustration and showed the camera his torn bicep before asking: 'Is this normal?'

He added: 'I've worked too hard in my life to have this as a headline.' 

Culpepper's frustration reached boiling point during a TV interview with ABC's Brian Ross, which will be aired on Thursday night.

He ripped off his shirt and showed a torn bicep and a shoulder injury to to the camera, asking: 'Is that normal?' 

Despite the controversy, he says he has no regrets competing in the show. He was voted off after 14 days and finished 15th. His wife was the show's runner-up.  

The lawsuit against Culpepper was filed in Orange County, California, in July. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Fairmont contended he was feigning injury while taking part in highly-publicized athletic competitions.

It read: 'Defendant Culpepper's conduct was fraudulent, deceptive and designed to inflate the value of his claim and to take advantage of and abuse the California workers' compensation system.'

The claim added that following his retirement he had taken up mixed martial arts, but failed to tell doctors about the new hobby.  

In response, Culpepper's attorney Scott Schutzman called the insurance company attorneys' version of events an 'exaggeration.' 

Challenge: Culpepper (pictured second from front in the boat) completed a number of arduous tasks during the 2013 reality series - including paddling a canoe and lifting heavy crates 

Career: Culpepper (pictured tackling St Louis Rams' Kurt Warner in January 2000) played nine seasons in the NFL after graduating from the University of Florida
