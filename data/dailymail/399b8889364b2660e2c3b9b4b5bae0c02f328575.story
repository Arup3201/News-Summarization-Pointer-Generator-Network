Australian cyclist Loren Rowney was knocked off her bike moments before crossing the finishing line during the European women's cycling tour, after a spectator reached out and hit her handlebars.  

Rowney was just a few metres away from finishing the Molecaten Drentse 8 in Holland.

The contact with Rowney's handles sent the 26-year-old tumbling to the ground. Spiritedly, Rowney did manage to finish the race by crawling over the line in seventh place, but she is understood to have suffered a broken collarbone.

South-African born Rowney lay on her back until medical officers helped her off the track.

Race winner and two-time world champion Giorgia Bronzini of Italy described the finish as 'strange'.

'I thought at first that maybe it was my fault,' she told, the Sydney Herald.

'But I've already seen the footage and it looks like a spectator grips her wheel. Very strange.'

Rowney took to Twitter to thank everybody for the well wishes. 

'I'll try and get back to you all... it's hard with 1 arm! on my way to Hamburg for treatment,' Rowney wrote on Friday.
