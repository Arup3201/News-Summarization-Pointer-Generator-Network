A pensioner broke down in tears when staff at a bank told her that a safety deposit box containing around £20,000 of family heirlooms had been lost.

Hayat Panwar had deposited the box, containing sentimental items such as her father's gold pocket watch and gold wedding jewellery belonging to her mother and grandmother, at NatWest bank in Solihull, West Midlands for safe keeping.

But when she went to collect the valuables for a wedding, staff told her that they could not find the box.

Devastated: Hayat Panwar was left in tears when staff at the NatWest in Solihull, West Midlands, told her they'd lost her safety deposit box containing £20,000 of family heirlooms

Mrs Panwar, 69, said: 'I went in and I had the box number and a set of keys, but they said they couldn't find it.

'I cried, I was so upset. It makes no sense to me - how they could lose it?

'How can you trust a bank that loses something like that?'

She said her health has suffered and she has been 'sick with worry' since being told of the loss in November last year.

And after almost six months of investigations, NatWest has so far been unable to trace the deposit box and has apologised to Mrs Panwar.

Mrs Panwar, who lives in the village of Cheswick Green, Solihull, said the bank has now asked her to supply a value for the goods so they can discuss compensation.

'I'm not interested in money,' she said.

'The money is worthless to me, the items are sentimental and no amount of money would pay for it.'

She said she had planned to pass the jewellery on to her daughter, sons and grandchildren.

Blunder: NatWest Bank has been investigating the loss for the past six months

A spokesman for NatWest said: 'We apologise to Mrs Panwar that we have so far been unable to locate her safe custody box deposited with us in February 2009.

'We continue to do all we can to locate the box, to try to bring about the very best outcome for the customer.

'In addition, we have made a request for information from Mrs Panwar as to the contents of the safe custody box in order to discuss compensation to go some way to make amends for the loss she has experienced.'

The bank added that it has been keeping Mrs Panwar regularly updated on the progress of its investigation as to what has happened to the deposit box.
