Hollywood film makers use the services of a British company to provide them with stunning wintry scenes.

Darcey Crownshaw, who lives in Gloucester, has been providing the white stuff for films such as Harry Potter and James Bond for 30 years.

His firm, Snowbusiness, provides 200 different types of snow made from materials including paper and plastic.

Some effects are created using a candle sized firework which produces a snow-like ash.

And real snow, which can last for up to three days if stored correctly, is also used on some sets.

One machine can distribute a square metre of snow in two seconds, and the firm has even sold its products to Siberia.

Mr Crownshaw, the Head Snowman said: 'Everywhere you go the snow you see will probably be ours, from Harrods, Oxford Street, Selfridges and the programmes on your television and films at the cinema.

'My favourite film we've worked on has to be The Day After Tomorrow - we filmed it in Montreal and it was minus 40 degrees outside so we were making fake snow inside as it was too cold.

'When I see our snow on screen, it's terrifying - I just look for faults in the snow, how it is laid out, whether the icicles look right - the only time I can appreciate it is when I don't realise it is ours.'

The company makes snow in 200 different ways, depending on the requirements for the film shoot.

Directors may need snow that falls slowly, small flakes or bigger flakes, all of which can be provided by Mr Crownshaw and his team.

He said: 'You name it we've got it. There are more ways to make our snow than the Eskimos have words for it.

'The most snow used was in the TV series Band of Brothers which used an entire aircraft hanger of snow over the course of three months filming.

1. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

3. The Day After Tomorrow

4. Bridget Jones

5. Love Actually

7. James Bond - Quantum of Solace

10. Gladiator

'When filming Sherlock a couple of years ago our lorry of snow got stuck in real snow and we've even sold snow to places like Siberia.

'Even though we come up against real snow sometimes ours is better - if you lie down in real snow its cold and wet - we supply film stars with comfy snow - sometimes on top of real snow.

'Working with snow is great because some days you can do nothing but others you can lay acres of snow.

'Challenges
 come when we work with directors who want their snow bigger and better -
 for the film Malificent the director wanted an incredible ice effect on
 water and didn't want to use CGI.'

Snowbusiness
 is the largest artificial snow producer in the world and have created 
some of the world's favourite snow-filled film and television moments.

These include festive scenes from Love Actually, Die Hard and Pirates of the Caribbean.
