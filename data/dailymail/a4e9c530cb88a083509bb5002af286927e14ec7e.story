Southampton are hoping to finalise a £5million deal for Feyenoord midfielder Tonny Vilhena.

Manager Ronald Koeman confirmed his interest in Vilhena last week and is continuing discussions over the loan of Benfica midfielder Filip Djuricic.

Serbia international Djuricic is already on loan at Mainz in Germany and has to have that deal cancelled first.

His compatriot, Southampton winger Dusan Tadic said: 'Filip's a really good player and a really good guy - we play in national team together. 

'He's having difficult time in Mainz, but he's a good age and a good player with quality. 

'We didn't talk but I probably will talk to him today. I don't decide, but I think he would be good here.'
