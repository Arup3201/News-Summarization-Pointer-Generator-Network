A math teacher and cross-country coach at an elite New Jersey boarding school has killed himself on the same day investigators went to the campus to look into allegations of sex between a teacher and student.

Donovan Dickson, 24, an apparently popular teacher at Peddie School in Hightstown, plunged to his death from the New York side of the George Washington Bridge last Friday morning.

Authorities refused to say whether or not he was the target of the investigation by police and county detectives and would not say if the two incidents were connected.

Suicide: Donovan Dickson, pictured with some of his students, has jumped to his death. It occurred the same day police went to the school to investigate reports of sex between a student and teacher

No charges have been filed in the case, a spokeswoman for the Mercer County Prosecutor's Office told The Times of Trenton. No charges means that the teacher cannot be identified.

Detectives had gone to the private school, which teaches around 500 students, on Friday to look at the possibility of bringing criminal charges against a teacher.

Hightstown Police would not provide details about the investigation or what had sparked it.

Dickson, who had been teaching math and coaching cross-country and wrestling at the school since 2011, jumped from the bridge on Friday morning, a Port Authority spokesman confirmed.

A police lieutenant 
reported that a person had been found beneath the bridge at 11.30am Friday.

Teacher: Dickson had worked at the school for two years as a math teacher and track and wrestling coach

Questions: Police in New Jersey would not say whether or not 24-year-old Dickson was the teacher who had potentially had sexual relations with a teenage student at the elite boarding school

He was pronounced dead at the scene and 
authorities were able to identify him through his keys, tattoos and by a
positive ID from his brother.

The school's headmaster, Peter A. Quinn, 
sent a letter to parents of students this week about the 'troubling 
events' that had taken place in the previous week.

Quinn did not say what is believed to 
have occurred between a student and a teacher at the school but assured 
parents that pupil safety was the key concern for staff.

'The broad outlines of those events are known; the details I cannot discuss,' he said simply.

He also spoke about two meetings he had had with students since Dickson's passing.

'At the first, I spoke to our students
about the ways in which people grieve,' he wrote. 'At the second I 
emphasized that their safety and well-being are always our top priority.

'I told them, there is no situation in which an employee is absolved from responsibility.'

Elite: Peddie High School is a private school in Hightstown, New Jersey, attended by 500 students

Scene: Dickson was found dead beneath the George Washington Bridge last Friday morning

Dickson,
who grew up in Concord, New Hampshire, was called a 'serious student 
and teacher, admired for his intellect and his patience' in his obituary.

'He
loved to laugh and make others laugh, and was always the first one to 
don a cape, face paint, or a costume to celebrate any occasion,' it 
said.

As news of his death broke amid the potential scandal at the school, students also shared their thoughts.

One student tweeted: 'Mr.Dickson you were one of my favorite teachers for two years. You were an extremely important part of Peddie.. RIP.'
