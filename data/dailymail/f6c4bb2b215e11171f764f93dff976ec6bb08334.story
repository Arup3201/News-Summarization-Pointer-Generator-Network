Angry motorists abused police officers and paramedics as they battled to save the life of a man who jumped from a multi-storey car park. 

Officers closed the NCP car park on St Jude's Passage, in Birmingham City Centre after they received reports of a man acting suspiciously. 

Members of the public became concerned after spotting the man sitting on the ledge of the car park and called the police. 

Emergency services were abused by angry motorists who wanted to access this Birmingham car park as they battled to save the life of a man who had fallen from the structure shortly after 4.15pm today 

Police immediately prevented anyone else from entering the building, which is only a short distance from the Bull Ring shopping centre, while a specialist team of negotiators raced to the scene. 

Unfortunately, the man, who is believed to be in his 40s, fell from the building. 

As police and paramedics battled to save the man's life, they were abused by motorists who wanted to retrieve their cars from the car park. 

West Midlands police confirmed that the man died in hospital shortly after the incident. 

Officers alerted the West Midlands Police Professional Standards Department who will investigate the handling of the case because officers were at the scene when he fell.  

Inspector Mat Minton, from Birmingham Police, said: 'As officers battled to save the man's life, police community support officers who were stopping people entering the area were met with abuse from drivers angry at being unable to return to their cars.

'My officers who attended have been left greatly upset by the tragic incident but all our thoughts remain with the man's family.

'Because our officers were at the scene when the fell, I have notified our Professional Standards Department in line with national guidelines.'

The area has been cordoned off while forensic officers examine the scene. 

The man has not yet been formally identified although his next of kin are believed to have already been informed about the tragedy.
