A British backpacker is lucky to be alive after breaking his neck and spine in an accidental plunge at a Central American waterfall, and being told he only had whiplash.

Ben Street, 26, was trying to climb beside the beauty spot in Nicaragua when he slipped and fell nearly 20 feet into the water below and cracked his head on a rock.

He surfaced with blood pouring from a wound and was given 100 stitches and painkillers by local doctors who told him he would be fine once his 'whiplash' had worn off.

Mr Street spent two days recovering at the local hospital before resuming his holiday, in a neckbrace, with girlfriend Jess Bains, 23.

They made their way to the capital city of Managua where he asked for another examination as his injury failed to clear.

It was here that X-rays and CT scans revealed he had suffered a compression fracture in his spine and a broken neck.

Mr Street was told he was lucky not to be paralysed, or even dead, because the slightest wrong movement could have caused irreparable damage.

He was put in special back and neck restraints to fly the 5,450 miles back to Britain where doctors said it was a miracle he is still alive.

Mr Street, from Norwich, Norfolk, has been ordered to spend five hours a day in bed to avoid any movements which could paralyse the right side of his body.

He said: 'When I hit my head and came up I was just so confused because I had hair in my eyes.

'Then I realised my scalp had just been pulled forward by the impact.

'Every time I talk about it I still get that little chill. I didn't lose consciousness but I took a real hit to the head.

'The look on my girlfriend's face when it happened was of the most complete horror and shock.

'She kept telling me it was just a bump but I could just see loads of blood in the water.

'I really thought that was it. When I came up out of the water I couldn't breathe and there was just a shooting pain down my back.

'I got taken to a local charity hospital and they started to stitch me up. They didn't have any anaesthetic and trust me I felt everything.

'There was about half an hour of surgery and I had 70 dissolvable stitches inside my head and 30 outside.

'I was there for about two days. They took X-rays but came back to me and said I had whiplash. They gave me a soft neck brace and let me go.

'When I got to the capital I went to see a private specialist and had some CT scans and things.

'It was there that I got told that I had a broken neck and a compression fracture in my spine.

'I was one knock away from being paralysed down my whole right side.

'When I was out there I was twisting and turning but now when I take the brace off to shave or something I hardly move.

'Every doctor that I have seen since then has said that I am lucky to be alive.'

Mr Street had trekked through Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras when he arrived in Nicaragua at the beginning of July.

The accident happened as he and student nurse Ms Bains visited the stunning waterfall at the Tisey Estanzuela Natural Reserve.

Mr Street will find out in two weeks if he needs to have metal pins fitted to help reset his spine and neck.

He is the drummer in rising band The Coasts, whose music has featured in Made in Chelsea and was one of the theme songs in the coverage of Euro 2012.
