Speaking to the camera: At the beginning of the interview she describes herself as a 'relateable woman on a couch' before revealing the content of the emails 

Speaking about the release of the emails, following pressure from her opponents and the media, she says: 'Go ahead, read them, you won't find squat.

'Those emails are as clean as a whistle. What did you think those emails said? "Hey it's Hilary I really screwed up on Benghazi".'

Referencing her probable run for president, she also insists: 'There will be no mistakes in my rise to the top.'

She then describes the nature of the content in the messages, suggesting they will either by 'fun woman talk' or 'mature romance' - relating to correspondences with husband Bill.

Giving an example, she reads out a fake email from a Gmail account sent by one of her friends: 'Hey Girl! Still up for a movie tonight? I heard that new Bradley Cooper one is hot. What do you want to see?'

Then, referring to what could be a saucy conversation with her former President husband, she reads an example: 'Dear Sir or Madam, Congratulations on your continued marital success. I would like to schedule a sit-down at your earliest convenience. Regards, The Office of Hillary Clinton.'

Clinton goes on to say she would also open up her Netflix account and her private Instagram account - showing pictures of her on a roller coaster and a beach looking down at her phone.  

At the end of interview, she insists that she will get through the scandal, saying: 'I have survived everything that has been thrown at me.

'I shall rise from the ashes like a Phoenix, nay, Hilary Clinton.' 

Throughout she also refers to her potential candidacy for the presidential race by saying: 'If I run, who knows.'  

The scandal was also brought up later in the show during the Weekend Update segment where anchor Colin Jost said he felt sorry for whoever would have to sit through the 50,000 emails essentially sent by a 'grandma'.
