The two new offences apply to anyone who maliciously or deliberately spreads intimate images of another person

In Victoria, it is now banned to circulate intimate images of anyone under the age of 18.

it is also illegal to send images of any person without their consent

Those who illegally spread such images can be jailed for up to two years.

If a person threatens to send these images, they could face up to a year in jail. 

The new laws also introduce exceptions to child pornography offences so those under 18 will not be prosecuted or placed on the sex offenders' register for consensual, non-exploitative sexting.

Attorney-General Robert Clark said it was important the law kept up with changing technology.

'Previously, the law provided only limited protection against malicious distribution of intimate images and this behaviour can cause considerable harm to victims, especially when images go viral,' he said in a statement.

In September, a Sydney pool cleaner become the first man in NSW to be found guilty of 'sexting' after a judge jailed him for at least three years.

Peter Lewis Sheather, 42, appeared in The Downing Centre Local Court where he admitted to using a mobile phone to harrass women by sending them lewd text messages, photographs and videos on his iPhone 5 between December 2013 and April this year.

The court heard that the resident of Cammeray, north Sydney, was a 'depraved' man who sent sexually explicit material to nine women telling them of his desire to 'f****' them by the pools that he cleaned.

Police stated that Sheather's sexting campaign caused 'fear and offence' against the eight women pool owners. Sheather was sentenced to three years in jail

He had been charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend after police seized laptops and documents from his home in late April.

In sentencing the 42-year-old magistrate Roger Prowse said Sheather was a 'depraved' man.

'If you had to look up the word depraved, you would find an entry: Peter Sheather,' he said.

He said Sheather deserved nothing less than a jail sentence for harrasing his nine victims  - customers of two pool maintenance firms, Pool Doctor Services of Roseville on Sydney's upper north shore and Swim Art in Rose Bay, in the eastern suburbs.

Sheather referred to several of his victims by name in a message saying, 'I'd love to f*** you in your pool', the court heard.

Victoria's Attorney-General Robert Clark says it is important the law keeps up with changing technology, to consider the damage that occurs when intimate images go 'viral'

Police facts tendered at a court hearing in June court stated Sheather's sexting campaign which caused 'fear and offence' against the eight women pool owners began on March 4 this year when he sent a text to a woman named Sheila at at 12.29pm saying, 'Hey u. Did you get my photo this morning'.

A second text to Sheila on March 14 at 7.12pm said in part, 'I'd love to f*** you in your pool ... Sheila'.

Police say the text frightened and offended the victim due to its 'overtly sexual nature' and the fact it shows the accused knows the victim's name and the fact the victim has a pool which cannot be seen from the street'.

The new Victorian offences rule that those who illegally spread sexually explicit images of people under the age of 18 or without an adult's will can be jailed for up to two years

Sheather's next victim was a woman named Brittany who on March 7 at 7.03am he texted a message with 'a picture of a male standing naked with a semi-erect penis'.

The head and face of the man could not be seen in the photo. The accompanying message read, 'Shower time. Wanna join me honey?'

Nicole did not answer because she believed the message was spam, however just over seven hours later, at 1.47am on March 20, Sheather sent her a 15 second long video which police say 'depicted an erect penis being masturbated and ejaculating' with a message saying, 'Nicky McSticky?'.

Sheather's last victim was a woman called Catherine, who he texted at 5.30pm on April 10 saying, 'I'd love to take to [sic] downstairs and f*** your brains out in your pool while you look over the harbour'.

Those who threaten to distribute images illegally can be jailed for up to one year according to Victoria law
