The son of a Canadian couple mysteriously under 
investigation in China for threatening national security has insisted that they were not undercover missionaries in North Korea.

His denial came as it emerged that Kevin Garratt, 54, and Julia Dawn Garratt, 53, from Vancouver,  were sent hundreds of thousands of pounds from a Canadian church to fund their North Korea-focused charity and made regular trips to the secretive state.

News of their Christian work in North Korea raises the possibility that the couple are facing persecution 
because of their religious beliefs, but their eldest son Simeon, 27, denied they acted as undercover missionaries in 
China or that their cafe on the China/North Korea border served as a front for unsanctioned religious 
activity.

Mr Garratt poses for some photos on social media.  Their eldest son Simeon said that his parents had a meeting with Canadian consular officials on Wednesday for half an hour each and said in a message through them that they were 'safe' but confused by their detention

'That stuff was all through the government
 of North Korea,' he said as he insisted his parents did not 'sneak 
across the border.'

Simeon, who now lives in Canada, told the Huffington Post that his parents had a meeting with Canadian
 consular officials on Wednesday for half an hour each and said in a message through them that they were 'safe.'

'The conditions are fine. The Chinese side kept 
emphasizing the fact that they're meeting with every human rights code,'
 he said, adding that his parents were being held in a guesthouse under 
constant guard.

'They're not allowed to leave or talk to anybody.'

'The
 best way I could describe is my dad is upset, for sure. I think he's 
angry, mad, confused, there's a lot of things that they have going on 
and it's not just them that suffers from this.'

His denial came as it emerged that Kevin Garratt, 54, and Julia Dawn Garratt, 53, from Vancouver  were sent hundreds of thousands of pounds from a Canadian church to fund their North Korea-focused charity and made regular trips to the secretive state

The couple are 'suspected of gathering and stealing intelligence materials about, among other things, China's military objectives and important national defence research projects,'  according to China's foreign ministry.

Their son who left China permanently in 2011, told the Vancouver Sun that
 Canadian officials have told him 'they do want to be involved' but have
 suggested the family hire a human rights lawyer to also start 
advocating for their parents’ release.

Simeon believes his parents will eventually be released, but will likely have to return to Canada.

'That’s hugely crushing — that’s pretty much their entire lives,' he said.

The couple, who have four children, moved to China in 1984 and run a coffee shop in Dandong, on the China-North Korea border

Today Rich
 Kao, head minister at a small church just outside Vancouver that backs 
the Garratt's charity, North Star Aid, said the couple, who moved to China in 1984, had been doing missionary work in the country and launched North Star Aid.

He said they were moved 
to focus on North Korea after seeing the poverty in the country and the 
contrast with improving conditions in China.

North
 Star operates as a subsidiary of Five Stones, Kao said, but is run by 
the Garratts from Dandong and largely staffed by church volunteers.

North Star's funding largely comes from outside the church, he said, and the group relies heavily on word-of-mouth for support.

'God said, in a prayer meeting, go to Dandong and I'll meet you there, and he said start a coffee house. We serve the best coffee on the border ... and we do some other things too,' said Mr Garratt

The
 charity's website says it serves North Korea 'with love and practical 
assistance' and features a photo gallery of workers delivering aid from 
trucks.

The investigation comes a week after 
Canada took the unusual step of singling out Chinese hackers for 
attacking a key computer network.

The Chinese embassy in Ottawa, however, is dismissing questions about the timing of the Garratts' detention.

'We
 believe there is no need to overinterpret this case,' spokesman Yang 
Yundong said in a statement. 'Various rights of the couple have been 
fully guaranteed.'

It is 
unusual for foreigners to be charged with violating China's state 
secrets law - a serious crime that is punishable by life in prison or 
death in the most severe cases.

China, who 
is Pyongyang's only major ally, has a very broad definition of state 
secrets and North Korea is deeply suspicious of Christian proselytising 
activities, punishing them harshly.

Doing anything that could be seen as overtly religious along the sensitive border with North Korea was risky, experts said.

'North
 Korean authorities cooperate really closely with China basically 
throughout the border region ... of course there is more risk along the 
border,' said Adam Cathcart, a specialist on China-North Korea ties at 
the University of Leeds.

In
 March 75-year-old Australian John Short was freed after the Christian 
missionary made a grovelling apology for 'insulting' North Koreans by 
'secretly' spreading the gospel.

Short, a South Australian missionary with the Global Hall Bretheren had faced up to 15 years in a harsh North Korean prison.

Last
 year, North Korea sentenced Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American, to 15 years
 of hard labor on charges he planned to topple the government through 
religious activities.

Washington
 has repeatedly called on Pyongyang to release Bae, expressing concerns 
about his health, but Kim Jong Un's regime has so far refused to budge.

There have been reports that the couple also helped people plan tours to North Korea, (pictured) but their son  insisted it was not a business and they just helped to arrange visits because they have a deep interest in the country and had become friends with local tour guides

Bae,
 45, was widely reported to have been conducting missionary work in 
North Korea. His family says he ran a company specializing in tours of 
the secretive country.

Two American tourists are also currently being held in North Korea - Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Edward Fowle.

Fowle is suspected of leaving a Bible in a nightclub in the northern 
port city of Chongjin, but a spokesman for Fowle's family said the 
56-year-old from Miamisburg, Ohio, was not on a mission for his church.

Less is known about Miller, or about what specific crime he allegedly committed.

The Garratts
 did little to hide their Christianity, according to people who had been
 to their Dandong cafe, which they set up in 2008 and which they said was known as a meeting point for
 foreign Christians in the area.

'It
 couldn't be any more Christian. It's always busy and they play 
Christian rock music in there,' said Gareth Johnson of Young Pioneer 
Tours, a travel company based in China that takes tourists to North 
Korea and who has visited the shop.
