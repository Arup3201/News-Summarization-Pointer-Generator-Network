Nicky Morgan claims teachers are ‘working far too hard, for far too long’ and has promised to slash their workload.

The Education Secretary lined up with Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg to propose ways to lighten the burden on school staff.

This includes not making alterations to qualifications in the academic year or during a course unless in ‘exceptional circumstances’.

Her conciliatory approach will be seen as another attempt to distance herself from predecessor, Michael Gove, who confronted the Left-wing educational establishment. She has earned the nickname of Ms U-Turn after a series of departures from Mr Gove’s policies.

In a joint article published in the Times Educational Supplement, Mrs Morgan and Mr Clegg said: ‘The commitment, dedication and sheer hard work of teachers up and down the country is inspirational. But far too many are working far too hard, for far too long – and it’s simply not sustainable.’

In contrast Mr Gove told teachers in September 2013 as they prepared to strike that they’d never had it so good.

The measures to reduce teachers’ workload follow a survey launched by Mrs Morgan last October called the Workload Challenge survey, which generated 44,000 returns.
