Baroness Warsi last night refused to back David Cameron's gay marriage bill, over fears it does not provide enough protection for religious groups

Baroness Warsi last night refused to back David Cameron’s gay marriage bill, over fears it does not provide enough protection for religious groups.

The faith minister and former Tory party co-chairman abstained on a crunch vote in the House of Lords where an attempt to throw out the bill was crushed.

Although members of the Government were given a free vote, many have privately felt under pressure to comply with the Prime Minister’s push for same-sex marriage.

Minutes before the vote, Lord Ancram, the former Tory party chairman, even urged ministers to give assurances that Tory peers would be allowed a ‘genuinely free vote’ after concerns that MPs were bullied into backing the Government.

But Lady Warsi refused to follow other Conservatives and vote in favour of the Bill, telling the Mail: ‘I have a number of ongoing concerns which have been raised by faith communities and others.

'I am in discussion with colleagues about them. At this stage, I felt that I could not vote for the Bill and so I abstained.’

Her remarks came as the party leadership warned that grassroots activists were abandoning the Conservatives over gay marriage.

A survey by ITV News showed three-quarters of local associations have lost members – and half of these said it was because of attempts to legalise same-sex marriage.

Despite their misgivings, Britain was a step closer to legalising gay marriage last night. Gay weddings could be conducted as early as summer next year if it is brought into law.

Religious organisations would be able to ‘opt in’ to offer gay weddings, although the Church of England would be banned in law from doing so.

A ‘wrecking’ amendment by Lord Dear, a former chief constable, was defeated by 390 votes to 148. Lord Dear had warned the legislation would ‘completely alter the concept of marriage as we know it’.

The bill was ‘ill-thought through’, had no democratic legitimacy and was ‘fatally flawed’, he said.

Critics of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill had argued that it had been fast-tracked through Parliament and was not in the Conservative Party’s manifesto or Coalition Agreement.

In one extraordinary intervention, Lord 
Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said the legislation was against 
everything he had fought for as a soldier for 40 years.

Lord Mawhinney, another former Tory party chairman, said he was sad that Mr Cameron failed to listen to concerns over the bill.

He accused Lord Feldman – co-chairman of the party – of snubbing his call for a meeting with the Conservative Grassroots movement so they could hand deliver a letter of protest.

In a dig at claims that Lord Feldman had privately criticised Tory activists at a dinner, Lord Mawhinney said that instead of listening to their concerns ‘we get referred to as “swivel-eyed loons”.’

During the debate, Baroness Stowell of Beeston, the equalities minister, said the legislation was a ‘force for good’.

The bill – which applies to England and Wales – will now face further scrutiny in the Lords, when peers are expected to attempt further amendments.

The Scottish government has also pledged to introduce gay marriage.
