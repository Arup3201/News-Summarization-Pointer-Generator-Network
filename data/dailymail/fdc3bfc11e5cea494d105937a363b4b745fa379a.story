A squalid end: The coroner's report details that Whitney's room was littered with drugs

The gory details of singer Whitney Houston's lonely death have finally been laid bare.

Whitney's
body was discovered face down in the bath tub, 'her eyes were congested
and there was a bloody purge coming from her nose.'

There
was 'superficial abrasions to the left side of her forehead and the 
bridge of her nose.' She also had cuts on her left arm, hand and 
shoulder.

It was a sordid end for the award-winning star, and officials insist there were absolutely no signs of foul play.

They
do note that the water in the bath where Whitney was found, with some 
evidence of trauma including a cut lip, was 'extremely hot.'

Not surprisingly, the beloved performer,
who was due to attend her mentor Clive Davis' Grammy Party at the same 
hotel that night, had scald marks on her back.

The report also confirms details of the drug paraphernalia found amidst the minutiae of the diva's final hours.

There was a 'spoon with a white crystal-like substance on it' and a 
'white powdery substance' which was later tested and determined to be 
cocaine in the late singer's hotel room.

The report, which gives a detailed description of the state of the Beverly Hilton hotel room when officials arrived reads: 'Located on the south portion of the counter was a small spoon with a white crystal-like substance in it and a rolled up piece of white paper, along with other miscellaneous items.'

'Located in the top drawer, in the north side of the counter were remnants of a white powdery substance, and a portable mirror on a base.'

Officials found more white powder on the base of the mirror.

It also reveals the probable cause of death: '[Whitney] possibly overdosed on a narcotic substance, prescription medications, over the counter medications and alcohol.'

Singer Whitney Elisebeth Houston was pronounced dead at quarter to four in the afternoon but almost six hours later at twenty-five to ten at night, the temperature in the bathtub was still 93.5 degrees.Â 

The final autopsy: This report contains all the gory details, and it's heartbreaking

Narrative: The police detective pieced together exactly what she discovered in the initial aftermath

The level of Whitney's drug abuse was evident due to a 'perforation of posterior nasal septum.'

The report also notes that when officials discovered the body, Whitney was wearing a brown wig 'tightly attached to the hair.'

The wig was removed revealing a a full head of wavy black hair with 'no balding.'

Houston also had traces of marijuana in her system as well as Xanax (anxiety medication), Flexeril (muscle relaxer) and Benadryl (allergy medication).

The report also describes a plastic bag ripped open with pills spilling out, medication bottles and an ashtray with cigarette butts all over the place.

What happened: The final hour of Whitney's life is accounted for here

Tragic: Whitney's death was ruled an accident, with all suggestions of foul play disregarded

When the 48-year-old singer's official cause of death was released in March her heart disease was mentioned, but the new detailed report also cites that she had a hole in her septum and that she was suffering from mild emphysema.

Kristy McCracken of the Beverly Hills Police Department also noticed an old needle puncture wound on Houston's inner left elbow.

On the day she died, Whitney Houston complained of a sore throat, so she decided to take a bath in at her hotel room at the Beverly Hilton before getting ready for Clive's party.

Sad details: The report mentioned that Whitney had benign tumours in her uterus

Secene: Whitney was found in her bathtub in the Wilshire Tower at the exclusive Beverly Hilton Hotel on February 11

The singer's assistant left Houston to run an errand at department store Neiman Marcus.

When the assistant returned to the singer's room around 3:35 p.m. on Saturday Feb. 11, Houston was lying face down in the bathtub in approximately 13-inches of water.

Devastated: Whitney with Bobbi two days before she died

The singer was pulled out of the tub by her assistant and bodyguard so resuscitation attempts could be made.

Whitney was found to be well-nourished, with a thick head of hair and scars from breast implant surgery.

Meanwhile, it has emerged that the singer's 19-year-old daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, is facing intervention from her family and friends.

She has allegedly turned to pills and marijuana to help her cope with the trauma of her mother's death.

According to America's Star magazine, Bobbi's aunt Pat recently arranged for several close family members and friends of the youngster to speak to her about her substance use, but their words fell on deaf ears.

A source said: 'Everyone is worried sick about Krissy ... her aunt Pat got a number of her friends and family to come to Atlanta and have a serious talk with her about her sobriety. There were lots of tears, but Bobbi Kristina didn't listen.'

Pat has even asked Whitney's long-term mentor Clive Davis to speak to Bobbi - whose father is the late singer's ex-husband Bobby Brown - about her problems.

The source added: 'Clive keeps telling Bobbi she needs to go to rehab, and that if she does, he'll help launch her music career. He's doing everything he can.'
