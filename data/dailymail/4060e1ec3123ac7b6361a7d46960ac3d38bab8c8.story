Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the government did not want to be in the 'business of vetoing aspiration'

Council houses are to be sold off for just 30 per cent of their market value to help more people get on the property ladder.

The government is to increase the discount available under the Right to Buy scheme first launched by Margaret Thatcher from 60 to 70 per cent.

Ministers said they did not want to be in the ‘business of vetoing aspiration’ and wanted to make it easier for families to own their own home.

David Cameron has ordered the government to do more to boost home ownership, increasing the numbers who can access taxpayer-backed mortgages and buying council houses.

Today it emerged house prices have soared by 8.4 per cent in the last year, fuelling fears of a new property price bubble.

House prices in Manchester have surged by 21 per cent, the fastest rate anywhere in the country.

Critics say a lack of new homes being built means supply is failing to keep pace with rising demand, and as prices soar many on low incomes will see the dream of buying a house disappear.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today announced that from this year council houses will be available to buy at a discount of 70 per cent.

A £75,000 cap on the cash value of the discount will also start rising in line with the CPI rate of inflation in a bid to revitalise the Right to Buy scheme.

Labour said the Government was failing on its promise to replace each and every home sold under right to buy and reiterated the party's pledge to build 200,000 homes if it wins power in 2015.

Mr Pickles said increasing the discount on houses from 60 per cent to 70 per of the full market price would drive aspiration and allow an acceleration in the rate Government delivers new affordable homes. The discount now matches that available on flats.

He said: ‘For years the Right to Buy was slowly strangled, with a miserly cap on discounts killing the prospect of home ownership for most social tenants.

‘We don’t think governments should be in the business of vetoing aspiration.

‘That’s why we reinvigorated the Right Buy. It’s all part of our long-term economic plan to make Britain a country on the rise, where hard working people can be rewarded with the security and peace of mind that comes from owning their own home.

‘We’ll also continue to plough the cash from additional sales back into delivering new affordable homes for rent, which will help drive up the rate of housebuilding across the country.’

A department spokesman said the law will need to be changed to bring in the increased discount before May.

But
 Labour’s shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said: ‘The Tory-led 
Government has failed to build the homes our country needs.

‘Housebuilding is at its lowest peacetime level since the 1920s, contributing to the cost-of-living crisis families face.

‘David
 Cameron has also broken his promise to replace every home sold through 
right to buy with another built. Only one home has been built for every 
seven homes sold.’

The 
changes come into effect at the beginning of the new tax year in April 
and Mr Pickles said there would be a £100 million fund to boost access 
to mortgages and provide right to buy ‘agents’ to help people through 
the process.

The Department for Communities and Local Government said 50,000 household had got onto the housing ladder since 2011, including 13,400 via the right to buy scheme.

The 50,000 figure represents the total of new property owner households aided by the Government, not the whole housing market. It also includes 36,000 assisted on to the property ladder through the Help to Buy and earlier schemes.
