A stillborn jaguar was brought back to life after a dedicated vet gave it mouth-to-mouth.

Dr Patricia Garrido gave the kiss of life to the jaguar cub, christened Ali, after it was found not to be breathing following a rare caesarean at a vet clinic in Madrid, Spain.

Ali's mother, Xena, had been taken from the local zoo to undergo the c-section as she had killed her two previous cubs shortly after giving birth.

The dramatic operation was captured on camera by fellow vet Antonio Rodriguez at the El Bosque Veterinary Hospital in Madrid, Spain.

He said: ‘The experience of seeing an animal start living and breathing after our help is really amazing. It is indescribable.’

The operation involved a team of 12 vets, nurses and assistants, and began well when they successfully deliverered a young male.

However, it was soon found not to be breathing and they began to perform CPR to kickstart its tiny heart.

They then began using a pump to force air into its lungs and when that failed Dr Garrido incredibly began mouth to mouth resuscitation.

When little Ali failed to start breathing following the surgery, one veterinarian resorted to giving mouth-to-mouth to bring him back to life

After a frantic eight minutes the team were relieved to find a heartbeat.

They then made sure to dry the cub, who has since been named Ali, and keep it warm as it recovered from the traumatic birth.

Mr Rodriguez said: ‘Ali could have died in eight minutes if it was not for the efforts of the team.

‘I do not have words to explain the emotion. I'm really happy with my team's work and we got a great reward.

‘Many of the workers are mothers themselves and they have a special sensibility to newborns.’

Following surgery, Xena has now been returned to a local zoo where she lives with her mate, Tango.

Ali is being hand-raised at another, smaller zoo as he cannot be returned to his potentially dangerous mother.
