Andrew Jeffrey Flanagan was sentenced to four years in jail in Texas for a string of offences

The conman-executive who got a six-figure job at Myer after fabricating his CV served time in jail in the early 1990s for a string of serious offences.

In 1992, Andrew Jeffrey Flanagan, then known as Jeffrey Wayne Flanagan,  was sentenced to four years in jail for burglary, reckless driving, assault and resisting arrest, The Australian Financial Review reported.

Mr Flanagan, believed to be from Arkansas, pleaded guilty to the offences in a Texas court and was later paroled by the Dallas County Sheriff's Office.

It is not known how long he served in jail.

The jail term came after he had been on probation for offences related to the illegal use of credit cards, The Australian Financial Review reported.

Mr Flanagan, was fired from Myer last week, on his first day as general manager of strategy and business development after the company discovered he had lied on his resume.

He claimed he had held the position of managing director and vice-president of Asia Pacific for Inditex, the Spanish company that owns popular fashion chain, Zara.

However, Inditex contacted Myer on Monday, just hours after Mr Flanagan started work at the company, to inform Myer that Mr Flanagan had never worked for them.

This was not the first time Mr Flanagan had committed the deception.

He was reported to the police in January after he was fired from the Australian Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry (AACCI) for providing references and credentials that turned out to be false.

Mr Flanagan was introduced to Myer by Quest Personnel and it is unclear how he duped the recruitment company who claimed they interviewed him several times as well as conducting international and local reference checks.

Mr Flanagan currently lives in Melbourne with his family.

Myer hired Mr Flanagan as general manager of strategy and business development and he began working for the company on Monday, but was fired before the end of the day

Myer CEO Bernie Brooks was not the only one to be fooled, several other companies considered Mr Flanagan for roles at their companies on the basis of his falsified resume
