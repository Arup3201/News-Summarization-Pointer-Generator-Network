Cristiano Ronaldo has told referees around the world to make sure defenders in the wall keep their distance from free-kicks.

The Portugal and Real Madrid star is already one of the best set-piece takers in the world, but his suggestion for a rule change could see him sending even more shots into the top corner.

'One rule that will work if it is used everywhere, is that when you have a free-kick, the referee puts the mark on the floor to make sure the defenders keep their distance,' Ronaldo said when asked at the Dubai International Sports Conference.

Rule change: Cristiano Ronaldo, speaking in Dubai, said he would like referees to use a marker to keep the wall 10 yards - he was asked questions by legendary referee Pierluigi Collina

Net gains: The Real Madrid and Portugal forward is already a free-kick expert, and the rule change could mean the Portuguese star scoring even more goals for club and country

Honour: Ronaldo was given the Global Soccer Award at the conference in Dubai

PEP GUARDIOLA, BAYERN MUNICH MANAGER

As a coach I would like to be able to make more substitutions, this would allow me to manage the team in a better way. It would be nice to have more players on the bench overall, really. Everyone would benefit from this because players would be less tired, as well.

FABIO CAPELLO, RUSSIA MANAGER

I would go for a timeout. From the bench we can't speak, have a tactical change, we can't convey a message. In Russia, when a player is down, we have a one-minute break to give other players the chance to hydrate. We could talk then.

ANTONIO CONTE, JUVENTUS MANAGER

Fabio stole my idea. A timeout would be a nice thing to have because form the bench it is not easy to communicate. If you see something is wrong, a two-minute timeout would be very useful.

Ronaldo, who has 40 goals in 32 games for club and country this season, was quizzed by legendary referee Pierluigi Collina. The star was also awarded with the Global Soccer Award for 2013 during the conference.

Luckily for the forward, FIFA recently confirmed that referees will be given a spray during the World Cup that will do exactly as he wants.

Several other players and managers were 
present at Dubai, including Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola, Juventus 
manager Antonio Conte and Russia coach Fabio Capello.

Guardiola said he would like to be able to make more substitutions to 'manage his team better'. Both Capello and Conte said they would like to see a time-out introduced.

The pair would like either a one-minute or two-minute break at some point during the game to be able to speak with their players.

The Portugal skipper hit four goals in 
two matches in the World Cup play-offs to qualify at the expense of Zlatan 
Ibrahimovic's Sweden, but Ronaldo believes his team will face a tough 
task in Brazil.

'I will be honest,' he said, 'I think we have to take it game by game because we have a very difficult group (USA, Ghana and Germany), starting with the first match against Germany, a fantastic team.

'For our country, passing the group is very important.'

Ronaldo also said 'hard work and dedication' are the only secrets to his success.

'Every season is a new challenge to me and I always set out to improve in terms of games, goals, assists,' he added.

'The
last six or seven years, I am always better than the previous year. It 
is part of me to make improvements and I try to dedicate myself all the 
time.'
