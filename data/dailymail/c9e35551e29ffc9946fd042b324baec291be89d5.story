Despite their father's claim that they 'tend to do everything together' most siblings would balk at sharing their wedding day with their brothers and sisters - particularly the brides.

However the five Waldie siblings - Emily, Sydney, Walker, Bradford and Brooke - synchronized their weddings and all married on the same day, one after the other, at the LDS temple in Mesa, Arizona. 

The brothers and sisters - aged between 20 and 28 - then threw a joint reception so large it had to be held in a hangar at an airplane museum.

The joint Mormon wedding took place on August 10. One by one, the ceremonies were held - three in the morning with a break for lunch and then two in the afternoon.

Getting married en masse was the suggestion of father Doug Waldie. After seeing that his children were in serious relationships, he joked that they should all tie the knot together.

Doug Waldie told the Desert News: 'We do tend to do everything together. We’re the ones who would take all eight 
to the grocery store. But I never thought they would each give up their 
special day; they did it to be together.'

The Waldies have eight children - one child is already married, another attends Brigham Young University while the third is still living at home. 

The details of the big day fell to the siblings' mother Kristen who made four of the five wedding cakes and most 
of the food for the 1,200 guests who were invited. She also sewed special folders to hold all five invitations that were sent out.

The reception was held in Mesa's Air Force museum - with signs hung from the rafters to designate each couple's special wedding zone. However all the important moments were taken together - including first dance and removing the brides' garters. 

Fortunately for each bride, the marriage proposals took place separately.

The eldest Waldie sibling Emily was the first to get engaged to partner Will Allen at Disneyland in California back in March. The couple met at work after Mr Allen moved to the state from Utah.

Younger sister Sydney got engaged 
less than a month later on April 16 after falling in love with Doug 
Schaub over a shared love of college football. 

Brothers
 Bradford and Walker made it a joint affair by proposing to their 
girlfriends - Megan Turner and Jillian Alger respectively - on the same day, April 21, albeit in different locations.

Kristen
 Waldie said as the family began to plan for four weddings, it made 
sense to combine the events so that family from out of state and across 
the world could see all the brothers and sisters getting married. 

The huge celebration was completed when sister Brooke and her boyfriend Todd Cook got engaged just two months ago in June.

The couples were already planning to mark their special day by organizing a joint trip to mark their first wedding anniversary next year.
