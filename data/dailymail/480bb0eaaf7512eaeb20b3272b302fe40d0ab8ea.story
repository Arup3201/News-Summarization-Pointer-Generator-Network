Alex Birkenstock, heir to the eponymous sandal company fortune, has listed his Manhattan penthouse for more than double what he paid three years ago.

Birkenstock picked up the 3,424-square-foot, 30th-floor pad at 40 Broad Street in 2011 for $5.86 million, then engaged in a $5 million renovation spearheaded by Miami-based interior designer Steve Harivel, the force behind nearby Soho House.

Lined with exposed brick, 1920s Art Deco doors from a Hawaiian theater and hardwood floors from the Portuguese embassy in Paris, the pad is now on the market for $12.99 million.

Platinum Properties' Daniel Hedaya and Khashy Eyn have the listing, according to The Real Deal.

The master bedroom was modeled on the 15th-century church in Palma, Italy

In 2012, Birkenstock sold a triplex penthouse in Miami Beach for $25 million, a record price for the area at the time.

The latest listing is a two-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment situated above the wellness center The Setai in the Flatiron District.

Following the mass-renovation, the place is full of exposed brick and furniture sourced from all over the world.

According to the listing, the sauna bathroom, one of three bathrooms within the penthouse, features reclaimed 1930's floral patterned hand-cut blue stone tiles from Belgium, and a grand stone tub which was cut from a single stone that was imported from Mexico.

'The room evokes the 15th-century church in Palma, Italy, on which it was modeled,' the listing reads.

'[There's] a highly curated array of fixtures and furnishings including Napoleon III chairs, tufted sofas in mohair, vintage French leather club chairs, haberdashery from a custom shirt and tie store in Boston, industrial factory lights and tables, 1920's street lights from Brussels and various mid-century modern items.

'The ceiling is made of reclaimed tin from institutional buildings. Adjacent to the kitchen are two floor-to-ceiling Gagganeau wine refrigerators that are located in close proximity to a custom 16-foot metal bar.'
