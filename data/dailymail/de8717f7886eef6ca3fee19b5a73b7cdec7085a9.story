'Client': Eliot Spitzer, pictured, enjoyed violence in the bedroom, pinning a former call girl to a bed and clutching at her throat until she struggled to breathe, she claims

Eliot Spitzer lusted after violence in the bedroom, pinning a former call girl to a bed and clutching at her throat until she struggled to breathe in a kinky role play, the ex-hooker claims.

In a new explosive book, Rebecca Woodard tells of the alleged tryst with the politician who she claims lusted after rough and tumble, forcing her to pretend she had just taken a self-defense class in the posh, Murray Hill apartment they had just met for their tawdry tryst at.

In graphic detail, the $1,500 hooker describes how Spitzer pretended to test her karate skills, exclaiming, 'Well, then, let's see if you learned anything,' before pouncing on her.

'The more struggle there was, the more he was into it,' the blonde writes in the book, 'Call Girl Confidential,' according to the New York Post.

'When he grabbed my throat, that was too much.'

Spitzer vehemently denies the claims.

'This is an old story, a complete fabrication, that is unequivocally untrue,' his spokeswoman, Lisa Linden, told MailOnline on Sunday.

'As the NY Times and NY law enforcement have already debunked the lies in this book, anyone who reprints it is knowingly repeating falsehoods. Eliot has no ties whatsoever to the person in question.'

Woodard, who writes for Simon & Schuster under the alias 'Rebecca Kade,' claims she worked for two notorious New York madams and eventually became a police informant, helping prosecutors take down Anna Gristina, known as the 'Soccer Mom Madam.'

Rebecca Woodard has recalled acting out the violent fantasies of former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer. The former call-girl claims Spitzer would enjoy strangling her and wrestling her before they had sex in her new book, Call Girl Confidential

'He wasn't squeezing,' Woodard 
recalls of the then-governor's bedroom antics, according to The Post. 
'He was pushing down. I was on my back. I don't know if he was trying to
 really hurt me, but he was...

'I was nervous. I was worried. This is not OK, I thought...

'It got rough. And then he put his 
hands around my throat, strangling me. He wasn't pretending to be a 
rapist. But he was like an attacker.'

She said she still had her lingerie on but he was naked and aroused at the time.

'I thought, What do I do to get this part over with? What can I do? At some point, we have to get down to having sex and move on,' she recalls.

Woodard does not mention whether Spitzer kept his calf-length black socks on - which he notoriously did in other encounters with prostitutes.

Woodard claims she was warned by the madam who booked the appointment that the at first anonymous client was 'important,' 'definitely wanted a struggle' and that 'mainstream intercourse' wouldn't be enough.

The now 37-year-old who describes herself as having a 'slim waist' and 'natural breasts' waited for the exploit to begin at an apartment in the Corinthian on Manhattan's East 38th Street.

Arriving in a shirt and tie, Spitzer told her he didn't want to use a condom, she writes in the book, but she replied that was 'not negotiable.'

The wrestling session then began, she claims.

'He was like some of the guys who envision themselves in a porn movie,' she said of the beginning of the role-playing.

She said she was in charge at first but he gained control.

'It was all about restraint and holding me down until I was nearly helpless. He really put on a lot of pressure, pinning me to the bed,' she writes.

'It takes a lot to scare me. I've been through a lot. But at this point I was starting to get worried...'

Woodard writes that he ignored her when she begged him to stop and never said 'I'm sorry' or 'Are you OK?' Though she explains he did give her a big tip when he was sated.
