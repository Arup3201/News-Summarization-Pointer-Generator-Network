British pupils lag behind their counterparts in the Far East because they spend considerably less time doing homework, a new analysis suggests.

International research spanning 65 countries shows a clear link between time spent on homework and higher academic performance.

Teenagers who put in the most homework hours tended to do better in an international maths test, according to the study, which is one of the biggest ever carried out into homework patterns.

It also revealed that British 15-year-olds complete a fraction of the homework of peers in East Asian nations which regularly take top spots in international maths rankings.

British teenagers spend 4.9 hours a week doing homework – substantially less than the 13.8 clocked up by counterparts in Shanghai, China.

The city, the biggest in China, came first in last year’s international table of teenagers’ maths performance in 65 countries and regions produced by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which also carried out the homework study.

In Singapore, which came second in the table, average homework hours are 9.4, while in Hong Kong, which came third, pupils put in six hours.

Britain – whose homework hours are the same as the international average - came an undistinguished 26th in the table, which is based on results in the so-called PISA test (Programme for International Student Assessment), given to 15-year-olds in participating countries every three years.

The study also found that Britain has one of the highest totals of pupils who do no homework at all.

Teenagers in Shanghai, China, came top of the OECD's list - clocking up 13.8 hours of homework every week

And the country has one of the largest gaps between pupils from middle-class and disadvantaged backgrounds in the amount of homework time clocked up.

The OECD concluded that spending more time on homework could influence the results of individual pupils and schools.

The benefit to pupils of attending a school which sets lots of homework could equate to six months of schooling, the research suggested.

But the OECD was unable to say that adopting more homework as a national policy would drive up a country’s performance in the rankings.

It said that other factors – such as the quality of teaching – were likely to be more crucial to the achievement of a country as a whole.

The study said: ‘The amount of time students spend doing homework is related to their individual performance in Pisa and to their school’s Pisa performance: students who spend more time doing homework tend to score higher in PISA, as do their schools.

But it added: ‘While the amount of homework assigned is associated with mathematics performance among students and schools, other factors are more important in determining the performance of school systems as a whole.

‘The average number of hours that students spend on homework or other study set by teachers tends to be unrelated to the school system’s overall performance.

Research showed that other factors, such as the quality of instruction and how schools are organised, have a greater impact on a school system’s overall performance

‘This implies that other factors, such as the quality of instruction and how schools are organised, have a greater impact on a school system’s overall performance.’

This may explain why Finland, which came 12th in the maths table, sets the lowest level of weekly homework among countries studied, at just 2.8 hours.

Experts said, however, the implications for individual pupils were clear.

‘These findings should finally silence sceptics who have argued that homework is bad for youngsters, causing stress and division in families,’ said Professor Alan Smithers, of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham.

‘Homework is clearly very important to reinforce lessons that are learnt at school. It is worrying that in this country there are lots of 15-year-olds who are not doing any homework at all,’ he told the Sunday Times.

‘It is a failure of schools if they are not setting and enforcing homework. The best schools set it, mark it and hand it back quickly and make a fuss if it isn’t done.’

He suggested that 15-year-olds should be doing 1.5 hours a night of homework, five nights a week.

‘That gives young people time to size up the problem and put in the effort, check it and then have some time to develop their hobbies later in the evening,’ he said.

The research will add to intense debate about the role of homework amid claims by some contributors to parenting website that it should be banned, at least in primary school.

Justine Roberts, co-founder of Mumsnet, said she wanted to see schools doing more to lean on pupils to complete their homework instead of expecting parents to police it.

‘If schools are serious about homework parents will support it, but it should not all be left to parents to make it happen. Where parents get really frustrated is where they feel they are battling alone to enforce it,’ she said.

The study prompted the OECD to call on schools to offer classrooms where pupils could work after school and help parents motivate children to finish their homework before surfing the web.

Andreas Schleicher, OECD education director, said: ‘One good way to make sure that homework doesn’t perpetuate differences in performance that are related to students’ socio-economic status is for schools and teachers to encourage struggling and disadvantaged students to complete their homework.

‘This could involve providing facilities at school so that disadvantaged students have a quiet, comfortable place to work, and/or offering to help parents motivate their children to finish their homework before going out with friends or surfing the web. The homework still has to get done; but maybe students and their parents will find it a little less troublesome.’
