A hero netball coach saved the lives of her team on the way to a match by grabbing their bus' steering wheel when their driver suddenly fell ill.

Lisa Stanley rushed from her seat as the driver slumped forward and the vehicle veered dangerously towards a ditch.

The 33-seater coach was picking up speed and had gone onto the hard shoulder of the M1 motorway in Derbyshire.

Quick thinking: Lisa Stanley, 35, at the wheel of her car, who stopped the bus as the driver blacked out at the wheel - and prevented a big accident

But Lisa managed to slam her feet on the brakes, bringing them to a safe stop.

The drama happened on Saturday just days after a Belgian coach crashed in Switzerland, killing 28 people.

Paramedics rushed the driver to hospital after he recovered consciousness.

Lisa, 35, coach of Team Northumbria's Netball Superleague team,said her 'instincts took over'.

She said: 'I noticed the bus speed up and go up over the hard shoulder and I looked up to see what the driver was playing at.

'But I saw his head slump towards the window and he slipped towards the floor.

'I just jumped up to try to take control - it was like my instincts took over.'

The team had been travelling from the North East for a Superleague clash at Loughborough Lightning in Leicestershire when the accident happened on Saturday.

The team had stopped for a break just half an hour before the driver, who worked for Stanley Coaches, fell unconscious near Junction 29A on the southbound carriageway at Holmewood, Derbyshire.

Lisa said the driver, who is in his 60s, had been in good spirits with the girls as they set off again, but just a few miles down the road he blacked out.

'I put my hand on the wheel but the bus was heavy and it had hit the first barrier,' said Lisa, who has a nine-year-old daughter, Ellie.

'I pulled it away, but because it was heavy it came round and hit the barrier a second time.

'I got one leg over the driver who was falling to the floor and got my foot on the brake, and my other leg on the clutch, and pulled it straight before slamming on the brakes.'

It was over in a matter of seconds but Lisa, of Seaham, County Durham. said the team had a lucky escape, as the bus was travelling at over 60mph.

Lisa added: 'About five or six of the girls were asleep at the time when the bus hit the barrier.

'They were actually flung from their chairs, whereas those who were awake had managed to brace themselves.

'I was just in adrenaline mode when I grabbed the wheel, but a lot of the girls were screaming around me.

'The bus was doing about 60mph, and some of the speakers on the overhead fell out because of the impact.

'A fellow member of the coaching staff was actually struck on the head by one of the speakers.

'They're are a few girls on the team who are only 17 or 18, so it must have 
been really scary for them.

The 13 players and four staff members escaped uninjured.

The bus driver regained consciousness as the bus came to a halt and was cared for by the team's manager and physiotherapist.

Emergency services were called and the driver was kept overnight in hospital, but has since been released.

The match had to be postponed as the girls were too shaken to play and were taken back to the North East.

'It all happened that quickly no one realised what was happening,' said Lisa, a former England international netball player.'

'But they were shaken when they got off the bus and a while later there were a few tears when the reality kicked in.

Andrew Scott, director of Stanley Coaches, said: 'The driver has well over 20 years experience and has driven all over the country and abroad.

'Fortunately, one of the girls reacted straight away and knew what was going on, jumped over the seat and took control of the steering wheel.'

He said the driver had been given a series of tests at hospital but doctors were unable to discover what had caused him to lose consciousness.

He is due to be kept under observation by his local GP.

Team captain Sam Holt said: 'Everyone is hailing Lisa a hero.

'I saw exactly what she did. I saw her jump over the driver and take control of the wheel.

'It was extremely surreal but we are just extremely happy Lisa had the reaction she did and grateful.'
