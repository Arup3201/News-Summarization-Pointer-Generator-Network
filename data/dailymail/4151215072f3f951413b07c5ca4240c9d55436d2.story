UKIP is harvesting thousands of votes from the BNP, Nigel Farage boasted yesterday.

He said his anti-EU agenda and tough line on immigration was proving increasingly attractive to supporters of the far-Right party, and had already persuaded a third of them to switch their allegiance.

The Ukip leader insisted he had ‘no truck’ with the BNP’s ‘racist agenda’ and said he was ‘proud’ to be attracting its voters.

Speaking at an event at Chatham House, in London, he said: ‘We are saying to BNP voters, if you are voting BNP because you are frustrated, upset with the change in your community but you are doing it holding your nose, because you don’t agree with their racist agenda, come and vote for us.

‘I would think that we have probably taken a third of the BNP vote directly from them.’ BNP candidates secured 940,000 votes in the European elections in 2009, but the party’s support has slumped since then.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said no one had done more than him to tackle the BNP

Mr Farage’s comments came as Nick 
Clegg claimed Ukip exploited the same ‘politics of blame’ as France’s 
far-Right National Front, which inflicted heavy defeats on the ruling 
socialists in local elections at the weekend.

The
 Lib Dem leader said both parties were feeding off a ‘profound sense of 
anxiety and insecurity’ created by the financial crisis.

‘It
 is understandable that when politicians who come along in different 
guises and say to people, all your problems can go away, just blame 
someone else – blame foreigners, blame immigrants, blame Brussels – that
 politics of blame becomes very appealing,’ he said. ‘But however 
appealing that might be it isn’t an answer to the modern world... you 
can’t turn the clock back to the 1950s.’

Nick Griffin's BNP won two seats in the 2009 European elections, but has lost support since

The
 Deputy Prime Minister also criticised Mr Farage for praising Vladimir 
Putin’s ‘brilliant’ handling of the civil war in Syria.

In an interview with GQ magazine, published yesterday, the Ukip leader was asked which world leader he most admired.

He
 replied: ‘As an operator, but not as a human being, I would say Putin. 
The way he played the whole Syria thing. Brilliant. Not that I approve 
of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?’

Speaking
 at a Westminster press conference, Mr Clegg said: ‘I think it is 
utterly grotesque that Nigel Farage apparently admires someone, Vladimir
 Putin, who has been the chief sponsor and protector of one of the most 
brutal dictators on the planet, President Assad.’
