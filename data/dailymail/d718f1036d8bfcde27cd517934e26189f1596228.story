Agreeing to judge the Miss Monaco beauty pageant in London in the run up to the F1 Grand Prix was not the toughest decision of my life.

Let me think about this: 21 stunning women, motor racing's most glamorous event, followed by the Grand Prix's most luxurious after-party. Yes, please.

The winner of Miss Monaco 2014 will have the arduous task of sitting aboard the Infiniti Podium Lounge 120ft tri-deck super-yacht to watch the race from the best spot on the race-track, with Moet champagne on tap. Next, if she isn't too exhausted, it's off to the Infiniti Podium Lounge after-party on the penthouse terrace of Zelo's nightclub.

Normally, this kind of A-list hospitality package would set you back around £10,000 per person, so it's safe to say that the competition is intense.

As I arrived, there were gorgeous women limbering up, hair being teased into shape, vertiginous high heels attached, last-minute make-up applied and Vaseline being put on teeth - it's an old beauty pageant tip to help contestants smile easily.

I also noticed a couple of rather racy ladies who were wearing little more than some bodypaint.

A few of the models came over to me before the start to say hello and bat their eyelids, but I made it clear that I would be a totally impartial judge.

One of them was well over six foot in her heels and towered over me, and was kind enough to slouch in our photo together.

Another contestant's boyfriend came over; he was very keen to point out that she was not single.

With that in mind, I took my seat on the judging panel next to the Infiniti Podium Lounge organisers John Clayman and Tim Johnson.

Following the eveningwear round a couple of favourites were way out in front.

It was a tough decision, but in the end we decided the winner was number 14, Hannah Matthews.

I think it was her impassioned speech about world peace and loving animals that clinched it - that, and the fact she was absolutely stunning.

But despite all that, the real winner on the night was the gorgeous model and Made In Chelsea newcomer, Emma Miller, who rocked up near the end of the night with her friend Victoria Gucci.

I invited Emma to go to the Infiniti Podium Lounge in Monaco with me, so hopefully Emma will agree to be my Miss Monaco.

Lots of love,

Spencer
