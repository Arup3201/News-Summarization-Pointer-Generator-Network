A transvestite has been jailed after claiming he was disabled and pocketing £88,000 in benefits while performing as the star of a drag act called Glitterlips.

Mark Hawthorne, 49, said he could barely walk and needed around the clock care to help him get out of bed in order to receive  disability handouts for almost a decade.

By night, however, he adopted the stage name Aunt Tilly and would strut his stuff in nightclubs to Tina Turner and Diana Ross songs as part of a double act.

He was caught out when fraud 
investigators discovered a video of him in action in a blonde wig, high 
heels and a cocktail party dress, which had been uploaded on YouTube and
Facebook.

Yesterday, 
Hawthorne was jailed for six months at Stafford Crown Court after 
admitting three counts of failing to notify the Department of Work and 
Pensions of a change of circumstances and two counts of fraud.

Judge Michael Challinor described his offending as ‘truly breathtaking’.

He
told him: ‘There are many unfortunate people in this country who are 
entitled to benefits. They get little enough as it is and people like 
you deplete the fund.

‘While
you were claiming, you appeared on stage as a female impersonator, 
regularly wearing high heels in an act that was often energetic.

‘You should have confined your acting ability to female impersonation rather than defrauding the state.’

Flamboyant: Prosecutors said an anonymous tip-off prompted its investigation into Hawthorn's 'systematic fraud' of the benefits system

Hawthorn had also failed to pay income tax or national insurance contributions from his on-stage earnings as alter-ego 'Tilly' 

In total, he fraudulently claimed £84,534 and admitted two further counts of knowingly and fraudulently evading national insurance payments and income tax to the tune of £3,759

The
court heard Hawthorne, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, claimed to suffer 
from a host of health problems in order to make fraudulent benefit 
claims between 2003 and 2012.

The drag artist claimed he could barely walk when he was in fact performing energetically on stage

He
claimed he needed care seven days a week, required help washing and 
could not walk more than a few feet without being left desperately out 
of breath.

On claims forms, 
he wrote that he needed to use his inhaler several times a day and that 
he suffered from neck pain and throat illness.

Meanwhile,
he was secretly going to the gym during the day, lifting weights and 
taking part in aerobics classes while carrying dumbbells.

After
a tip-off to the DWP, he was secretly filmed three times going to the 
gym in June 2012, arriving in his Nissan Qashqai, a car provided under 
the Motability scheme.

DWP 
investigators also came across a 50-second video, ‘The  Legend of Aunt 
Tilly’, showing him performing in front of screaming crowds.

Investigators
later discovered he was paid up to £250 a time as a ‘showgirl’ in bars 
in the Midlands and that he wrote on credit card applications that his 
job earned him up to £25,000 a year.

In
total, Hawthorn was overpaid £84,534 in disability living allowance, 
income support, council tax benefit and housing benefit over nine years.

He
also avoided paying almost £4,000 in income tax and national insurance 
while working as ‘Tilly’ for entertainment company Telstar.

Trevor Meegan, prosecuting, said: ‘This was a flagrant and systematic fraud.

‘He went by the stage name of Tilly, performing as part of a double act called Glitterlips, or The Tourettes.’

In
mitigation, Kate Thomson, defending, said Hawthorn suffered from 
depression and was, despite his alter ego, a ‘very shy individual’.

She
said her client had had a ‘horrendous’ early life and was then 
diagnosed with a ‘severe illness’ which, although not disclosed in 
court, had seen him given a year to live by doctors, when first 
identified more than a decade ago.

It
was this condition which led him to make his initially truthful benefit
claim, she said, adding that he was  ‘very remorseful’.
