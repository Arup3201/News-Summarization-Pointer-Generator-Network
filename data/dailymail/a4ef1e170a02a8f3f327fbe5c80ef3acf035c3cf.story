A teenager who visited doctors with 'heartburn' was amazed to find he actually had a cyst the size of a grapefruit crushing his heart, and forcing it 3cm to the right.

Stunned doctors told 19 year old Daniel Tamburro if they had not caught the growth his heart would have exploded.

Mr Tamburro, from Halesowen, West Midlands, had initially believed he was suffering from chronic heart burn but was rushed to hospital after collapsing at work.

Now and then: Doctors told Daniel Tamburro (now, left) if they had not caught the growth his heart would have exploded (after the operation, right)

Doctors performed an X-ray which revealed a large shadow on his left lung but medics were left in shock when a CT scan revealed a grapefruit-sized cyst pressing against his heart.

They said it  was growing at such a rapid rate it was literally forcing his major organs across to the opposite side of his body.

He underwent a six hour operation at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, in June to remove the 15cm by 12cm growth.

But, remarkably, Mr Tamburro was back at work as a production assistant within three months of the massive operation and has since made a full recovery.

He said: 'I was just at work and sat down but every time I breathed in it hurt. It was like indigestion.

'The boss said go to hospital to get it checked. I expected to be back by lunch but ended up being off for three months.

Scarred: The cyst was growing at such a rapid
rate it was literally forcing his major organs across to the opposite 
side of his body.  It measured 15cm by 12cm - the same size as an average grapefruit

'I was really worried after the scan, I didn’t know anything about it. 

Today the teenager is back in good health and is back at work

'They said it was really rare and they had never seen anything like it. It had moved my heart 3cm to the right.

'I was in theatre for six hours in the end. They cut me open from the back and they had to crack a few ribs.

'They managed to cut it out and reconnect a vein that it was connected to. I was in hospital for six days after and had three months off work.'

'I couldn’t sit up properly and even now I can’t lift heavy stuff. It was terrifying. I can’t believe something so big was growing inside me and I didn’t know anything about it.

'Doctors told me it was like dodging a seven inch bullet. I’m surprised to be alive today.'

Mr Tamburro had been planning a holiday for the end of June.

But doctors told him if he had left the cyst untreated until then, it would have killed him.

He added: “Doctors said if I had gone on holiday in a plane like we were planning to in June, the pressure would’ve been too much and my heart would’ve exploded.

'I’m very grateful to the hospital for operating so quickly.

'My parents were really worried about it and my girlfriend Danielle hated it because the operation was on her 18th birthday.

'She knew how important it was though and as soon as I came back around she was fine. I feel very lucky to be here today, it’s amazing my life was saved thanks to a bit of indigestion.'
