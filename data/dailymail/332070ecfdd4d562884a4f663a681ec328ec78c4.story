Stark warning: Former teen conman Frank Abagnale says the personal details revealed by millions on Facebook enable identity theft

The famous former teenage conman whose exploits were immortalised in the Hollywood blockbuster Catch Me If You Can has issued a stark warning about the dangers of Facebook.

Frank Abagnale, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the Steven Spielberg film, said that the personal information revealed by millions on the social network is a rich seam for identity thieves.

Children in particular need to be made aware of the serious risks of unwittingly revealing personal information online, he added.

Once dubbed the world's greatest conman, Mr Abagnale spent half his teenage years on the run as a confidence trickster, imposter, cheque forger and escape artist in the Sixties.

The 64-year-old is now a security consultant for US law enforcement agencies -  including the FBI -  having switched sides when he was eventually caught.

He said Facebook gives away too much personal information about you and this can allow con artists and impersonators to use your history of ‘likes’ to discern your personal info, lifestyle choices and personality traits.

He also warned against using ‘passport style’ photos as profile picture and said being pictured in group photos was safer. 

‘If you tell me your date of birth and where you’re born on Facebook, I’m 98 per cent of the way to stealing your identity,’ he told the Guardian.

‘Never state your date of birth and where you were born on personal profiles, otherwise you are saying “come and steal my identity”,’ he warned.

Window to the soul: Facebook gives away too much information about you and this can allow impersonators to use your history of ¿likes¿ to discern your personal info, lifestyle choices and personality traits, he warned

Frank Abagnale spent half his teenage years in the Sixties on the run as a confidence trickster, imposter, cheque forger and escape artist.

He became one of the most famous impostors ever, claiming to have assumed no fewer than eight identities.

He escaped from police custody twice (once from a taxiing airliner and once from a U.S. federal penitentiary), before he was 21 years old.

He served fewer than five years in prison before starting to work for the federal government and is currently a consultant and lecturer for the FBI academy and field offices.

He also runs Abagnale & Associates, a financial fraud consultancy company.

He said children in particular need to be made aware of the serious risks of unwittingly revealing information online.

‘What I did 40 years ago as a teenage boy is 4,000 times easier now,’ said Mr Abagnale, who is known as one of the most successful impostors of all time, assuming the identities of pilots, doctors, lawyers, and even a U.S. prison agent.

‘Technology breeds crime,’ he said.

‘I’m not on it Facebook, but I have no problem with it,’ he said, addressing the Advertising Week Europe conference in London last night.

He added: ‘I have three sons on it. I totally understand why people like it. But like every technology you have to teach children, it is an obligation of society to teach them how to use it carefully.’
