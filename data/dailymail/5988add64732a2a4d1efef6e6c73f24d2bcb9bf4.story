She has lived a rock chick lifestyle.

But it appears that Patsy Kensit’s love life is decidedly un-rock ’n’ roll. 

The 45-year-old actress has revealed that she has had just four boyfriends – and they all became her husband.

Although Miss Kensit has only ever married musicians, she sealed her reputation as a rock chick when she began dating Oasis front man Liam Gallagher, who went on to become her third husband.

Speaking at a debate in London on the importance of a woman’s looks in public life, the star was asked if she had ever used her body to trap men.

Miss Kensit, who once stripped off for a topless session with Vogue in the 1990s, declined to answer the question directly and instead quipped: ‘I married all my boyfriends.’

Her first marriage came as she made her own foray into the pop world as the lead singer of Eighth Wonder, who had two top 20 singles in 1988.

She married Dan Donovan, the keyboard player in Big Audio Dynamite, in the same year at the age of just 19, having already made her name as an actress in the lead role of the film Absolute Beginners.

They split three years later and she married Simple Minds lead singer Jim Kerr in 1992. They had a son James, now 20, but broke up after four years.

Within a year, Miss Kensit had married Mr Gallagher after meeting him on a plane. They had a son, Lennon, in 1999 but separated the following year. 

In November 2007 she declared she was marrying Jeremy Healy, a member of 80s novelty pop group Haysi Fantayzee and now a leading club DJ. 

She described him as ‘perfect’ and they finally married in April 2009, but it was all over little more than a year later. 

She did not rule out falling in love again. ‘I have to say at this point that I am a hopeless romantic,’ she said. 

‘I truly am. I do believe in love and still believe in love and I shall continue to do so.

‘I would never dress up for a man, unless I was going to get some pleasure from it too.

‘Sex as you get older gets a bit scarier. Do I control men with the way I look? The ones I married? They fell in love for my sweet nature.’

Despite being romantically linked to a string of high-profile men over the years – including comedian David Walliams, Spandau Ballet guitarist Gary Kemp and actor Leo Gregory – in her recent autobiography, Absolute Beginner, she only describes being in relationships with the four men she married.

Miss Kensit, who has forged a career on TV soaps Emmerdale and Holby City in more recent years, also spoke in the debate of the pressure to stay thin.

‘This whole weight thing is horrible,’ she said, before adding that a woman’s approval ‘means so much more to me than a man’s’.
