Chilling photos show killer cab driver Christopher Halliwell prowling the streets for a victim on the night he murdered office worker Sian O'Callaghan.

A series of CCTV images show him cruising though Swindon in Wiltshire in his green Toyota Avensis searching for a victim after clocking off from his shift.

He found his pretty victim after she 
left a city centre nightclub shortly before 3am - but it would have 
quickly become apparent to the terrified young woman that she was not being 
driven to the home she shared with her boyfriend Kevin Reape.

The timeline of images helped lead police to the savage killer, who yesterday was sentenced to a minimum of 25 years after pleading guilty to the murder of 22-year-old Miss O'Callaghan on March 19 last year.

When police tracked down the 48-year-old murderer, he was sickeningly displaying a missing person's poster in the back window of his car - which he had used to drive the terrified office worker to a nearby forest where he killed her.

Colleagues said he had also callously discussed her disappearance with them, as he pretended to be helping in the search for missing woman.

In fact the taxi driver knew exactly where the young woman was.

After picking up Miss O'Callaghan, he drove her to nearby Savernake Forest where he sexually assaulted her and stabbed her to death.

In the six days before he was arrested by police, he moved the woman's half-naked body to near the Uffington White Horse landmark in Oxfordshire - 15 miles from where she lived.

Other CCTV images show him calmly filling up with petrol and paying at a cash desk displaying the missing person poster after the murder.

The prowling taxi driver now faces questioning over a string of unsolved killings, it emerged last night.

But
last night sources revealed he could now face questioning over the 
disappearance of Melanie Hall – who vanished outside a nightclub in 1996
and whose body was found by the M5.

He is also likely to be quizzed over the whereabouts of two other women who both lived in Halliwell’s home town of Swindon.

Detectives have discovered Halliwell 
owned 80 cars over the years and have since tried to trace their current
owners through the DVLA in case forensic evidence can still be 
recovered.

Police were further worried when a 
colleague said Halliwell had speculated about there being lots of bodies
buried while discussing Miss O’Callaghan’s disappearance.

Killer Halliwell pretended to be helping in the search for the missing 22-year-old by displaying a 'missing person' picture in the back of his car

He told him: ‘Who knows what or who you find buried out there? There could be loads of people over the years.’

He led detectives to Miss 
O’Callaghan’s body on the day he was arrested, it was found face down 
and naked from her waist to her ankles.

A swab subsequently revealed she may have been bitten on the left breast by her killer.

Detectives in neighbouring force Avon 
and Somerset have told their Wiltshire counterparts they believe he is 
the strongest suspect yet for the murder of Melanie Hall.

The officer in charge of the investigation said the disappearance of the university graduate 16 years ago is ‘top of our list’.

Similar to Miss O’Callaghan’s 
abduction, the petite blonde was last seen leaving a nightclub in Bath 
in 1996. Her remains were found tied together with a piece of blue rope 
beside the M5 in south Gloucestershire in 2009.

Officers have been informed that 
Halliwell was working as a taxi driver during this period and could have
been taking bookings in the city.

His internet history also revealed he 
heavily researched rope knots and binding techniques. The disposal of 
her body is also extremely similar to that of Miss O’Callaghan’s.

Other cases being looked at include 
those of prostitute Sally Ann John, 24, from Swindon, who went missing 
in 1995 and lived in the same street as Halliwell, and Vietnamese 
immigrant Thi Hai Nguyen, 20, who vanished from Swindon in 2005.

Several books on DNA and forensic testing were found in his loft along with a stash of wet wipes.

Sentencing Halliwell to a minimum of 
25 years for Miss O’Callaghan’s murder, Mrs Laura Justice Cox DBE said: 
‘You abused your position as a taxi driver... and as someone Sian 
thought she could trust. There was here a prolonged period of time in 
which she would have suffered extreme fear and terror as well as severe 
pain from the injuries you inflicted upon her.’

Miss O’Callaghan’s mother Elaine said:
‘There is never total closure, just accepting my life has changed for 
ever. I am just a mother who wants her daughter back.’

Speaking outside the court today, Miss 
O'Callaghan's mother Elaine described her daughter as an 'incredible 
person' and said she  would 'continue to inspire' her family.

'Christopher Halliwell has by his actions taken my daughter and caused unimaginable distress,' she said.

'The sentencing today of Halliwell will not bring Sian back, but will mean he can't take any more.

We will all endeavour to get on with our lives, the way Sian would have wanted,' she said.

Sian's father Mick welcomed the life sentence for his daughter's killer.

'Justice has been done today,' he said, before thanking the family's QC, the CPS and police.

'It has been a very emotional day.'

Referring to the withdrawal of the separate charge against Halliwell related to the death of Becky Godden-Edwards, Mr O'Callaghan said: 'Our thoughts go to Becky's family.'

Becky Godden-Edwards devastated mother Karen Edwards tearfully described her family's anguish outside the court following today's hearing.

The mother gave an emotional speech 
about how her daughter had become addicted to drugs, but she had never 
given up hope that one day she would return home to her family.

'After a very complicated and painful journey over the last 18 months Sian's family have today had the justice for murder of their beautiful daughter,' she said.

'However, our family's fight for justice for Becky has only just begun.

'Even though Becky has been found, after all this time we still have no full understanding of how she met her death.

'As you can imagine this has been a very dreadful time for all our family and I would like to thank everyone for the continued support in our struggle for justice for Becky.

'I would like the full support of you all to help me get justice for my daughter Becky,' she added.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission said in a statement it was to independently investigate breaches of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 in the investigation into the deaths of Becky Godden-Edwards and Sian O'Callaghan.

IPCC commissioner Naseem Malik said: 'Now that the criminal process has concluded the IPCC can start its investigation into the police investigation into the tragic deaths of these two young women.

'We were unable to start work before criminal proceedings concluded on the advice of the Crown Prosecution Service.

'I have no doubt that there will be considerable interest in the circumstances that led to the IPCC investigations but I would urge patience while we find out what happened.

'The IPCC has already concluded an independent investigation into five complaints against Wiltshire Police relating to the actions of the police during the investigation.

'Three of these complaints were upheld and the force has agreed our recommendation to offer the complainant an apology.

'The force has also confirmed to the IPCC that it has accepted our recommendation that it reviews its family liaison policy.'

The IPCC said it would also separately investigate allegations that Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher spoke about the case to some media outlets on separate occasions contrary to force instructions, the force media strategy and policies.
