The death penalty carries a heavy price in California, and not just to those executed.

The legal practice also costs taxpayers billions, at a time when the state languishes under crushing debt.

Golden State taxpayers have spent more than $4 billion on capital punishment in 
since it was reinstated there in 1978, or about $308 million for 
each of the 13 executions carried out there since then, according to a 
new report.

The analysis by a senior federal judge and a law 
professor estimated that the additional costs of capital trials, security on death row and legal representation through long appeals for the 
condemned adds $184 million to the budget each year, reports the Los Angeles Times.

The study's authors, U.S. 9th Circuit Judge Arthur L. Alarcon and Loyola Law School professor Paula M. Mitchell, predicted that the death penalty will cost California $9 billion by 2030, when death row will house more than 1,000 condemned inmates.

For their report 'Executing the Will of the Voters: A Roadmap to Mend or End the California Legislature's Multi-Billion-Dollar Death Penalty Debacle', the authors examined previously unavailable records from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

Mr Alarcon and Ms Mitchell suggested three options to reduce the ballooning costs of capital punishment: fully preserve the practice with $85 million more in funding each year; reduce the number of death penalty-eligible crimes for an annual savings of $55 million; or abolish capital punishment and save taxpayers about $1 billion every five or six years, reports the Los Angeles Times.

Mr Alarcon prosecuted capital cases while serving as a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney in the 1950s and served as clemency secretary to Governor Pat Brown. He said he does not oppose the controversial death penalty and believes California voters do want to keep it as an option.

Ms Michell is his long-time law clerk, though she says she favours eliminating capital punishment in her state.

Even so, both authors claim they approached their report as impartial academics, focused on the economics of the issue.

Four years ago, Mr Alarcon pointed out that it took an average of 17 years from conviction to execution in California, two times the national average.

Now, it takes longer than 25 years, and no executions have taken place in the state since 2006, despite a crowding death row that now numbers 714 inmates.

No executions are likely in the near future, according to the Los Angeles Times, due to legal challenges to the state's lethal injection procedures.

The report stated: This 'reflects a wholesale failure to fund the efficient, effective capital punishment system that California voters were told they were choosing' in the battery of voter initiatives over the last three decades that have expanded the penalty to 39 special circumstances in murder.

Unless major reforms are made, the authors claim 'capital punishment will continue to exist mostly in theory while exacting an untenable cost', writes the Los Angeles Times.

Among their findings to be published next week in the Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review:

The state's 714 death row prisoners cost $184 million more per year than those sentenced to life in prison without parole.

A death penalty prosecution costs up to 20 times as much as a life-without-parole case.

The least expensive death penalty trial costs $1.1 million more than the most expensive life-without-parole case.

Jury selection in a capital case runs three to four weeks longer and costs $200,000 more than in life-without-parole cases.

The state pays up to $300,000 for attorneys to represent each capital inmate on appeal.

San Quentin: Federal judges have found fault with about 70% of the state's death row convictions, sending them back to trial courts. California also has a lack of lawyers who are experienced in death row appeals cases

The heightened security practices mandated for death row inmates added $100,663 to the cost of incarcerating each capital prisoner last year, for a total of $72 million.

The study echoes findings by the bipartisan California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice in 2008 and a 2009 report by the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California.

There is a lack of death penalty-qualified attorneys in California, perhaps only 100, which leads to long delays.

Federal judges have found fault with about 70% of the state's death row convictions, sending them back to trial courts. 

The report claims voters have not been apprised of the real costs of capital punishment over the years.

The authors concluded: 'We hope that California voters, informed of what the death penalty actually costs them, will cast their informed votes in favour of a system that makes sense'.
