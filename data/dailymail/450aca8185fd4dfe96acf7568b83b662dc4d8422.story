It may be known for its rude waiters, but Paris is today celebrating after another of its restaurants was awarded three Michelin stars.

Chef Yannick Alleno, who runs the Pavillon Ledoyen in central Paris, was crowned with the coveted three stars in the Guide's latest France edition.

There are now 609 Michelin-starred restaurants in France – one fewer than last year, although the capital city has gained a new three-star restaurant.

Paris alone had nine three-star restaurants, including the Pavillon Ledoyen, under a new chef Yannick Alleno in the kitchen.

'We found a Yannick Alleno at the top of his game,' said Mr Micheal Ellis, director of the international guides for Michelin, who singled out for special praise a soufflé of smoked eel with a watercress reduction, The Telegraph reported. 

The 46-year-old had already received a three-star rating in 2007 for his cooking at the Hotel Le Meurice, which he left in January 2013. 

Restaurant La Bouitte, in Saint-Martin-de-Belleville in eastern France, helmed by chefs René and Maxime Meilleur was also awarded the exclusive three-star rating.

The father-and-son team Rene and Maxime Meilleur were described as 'extraordinary.'

Their 'extraordinary' skills with fish, and their meals were hailed as 'generous, authentic and full of emotion,' by Mr Ellis.  

In all, 609 French restaurants received at least one Michelin star this year.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who is also in charge of tourism planning, introduced this year's Michelin guide to the country's best restaurants. 

The gala celebration of French cuisine underlined the message that France aims to cater to visitors who come for the food.

The news was announced on the official Michelin Twitter account

Michelin was hoping to encourage more road trips - and thus more tire sales - when it started its guide in 1900. At the time, the free book also had listings for gas stations, mechanics and hotels as well as city maps.

Today, Michelin has a multitude of guides, some focusing on restaurants, others with a range of tourism-related listings. The company has expanded to include separate versions for New York City, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Macau. 

The 2015 guide crowned 80 two-star restaurants, seven of which were new, and 503 one-star restaurants.

France has 29 three-star restaurants, nine of which are in the capital. 

The three previous editions of the guide crowned one new three-starred chef each and none in 2011.

Last year, the most coveted accolade in gastronomy went to Arnaud Lallement, of the family-run L'Assiette Champenoise near Reims in northeastern France.

The new guide was unveiled at the French foreign ministry on Monday 2 February. 

Star ratings for restaurants in other counties will be published at different dates in the coming months.

The criterion for winning three stars is that the restaurant must serve up 'exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey'.
