Wayne Rooney is under pressure and facing the biggest challenge of his 93-cap England career.

There are four attacking positions in Roy Hodgson’s team and it is beyond dispute that Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling are now automatic names.

Rooney had that security once but he is now vying with Ross Barkley, Adam Lallana, Danny Welbeck and James Milner for the other two spots.

Time to perform: Wayne Rooney must produce a good display in England's second World Cup game against Uruguay to remind us of his class

Night of frustration: Though Rooney set up England's goal, scored by Daniel Sturridge, he struggled to contain Italy's Matteo Darmian and Antonio Candreva

Headscratcher: Roy Hodgson must decide whether to keep Rooney in his left-sided position against Uruguay on Thursday

Playing him wide left against Italy — something I advocated 10 days ago — has increased the debate about his place in the starting line-up after he had problems containing the excellent combinations Matteo Darmian and Antonio Candreva.

In the months building up to the World Cup, Hodgson was urged to be bold in his selection and that is exactly what he was. It is why the majority are still upbeat even though Group D began with a defeat in Manaus that has left no margin for error.

Criticism of Rooney came from the fact he looked lost defensively but, when you have a striker operating in that area, those are the risks associated with being more adventurous; that he ventured into the space left by Darmian to create Sturridge’s goal showed the benefits of playing him there.

Hodgson could have gone for a more solid line-up and played Milner but what would the reaction have been? Same old cautious Roy.

Rooney, who should have equalised in the second-half, was put in the role so England had players coming from deep to cause Italy more problems and the system was also designed to stop the control that Andrea Pirlo would have on the game.

No longer automatic: Rooney faces competition from a number of players for his place in the England team

Competition: Raheem Sterling occupied a central position against Italy in order to more effectively link up with striker Daniel Sturridge

Better form: Sturridge continued his scoring streak this season when he converted Rooney's cross on 37 minutes

Sterling did the first bit brilliantly with a performance that showed he has come of age but the peerless Pirlo — and the outstanding Daniele De Rossi — could not be stopped pulling the strings with their remarkable pass completion statistics; both were more than 90 per cent.

England’s problem on the left was more with Leighton Baines than Rooney. A full-back can see the whole picture but they were both caught in between positions too often; Baines should have ordered Wayne to tuck in and stop the supply to Candreva.

The other option would have been for Wayne to stick close to Darmian and Baines could have pushed on to Candreva.

Defensive duties: Rooney attempts to block a cross by the impressive Antonio Candreva but Italy held the upper hand on that flank for much of the match

Tormented: Antonio Candreva caused endless problems for Leighton Baines in the England left-back position

This culminated in the winning goal when Baines was caught between pressing Darmian or staying  with Candreva. He did neither and England paid the ultimate price. The communication from Baines should have been better.

Uruguay, however, do not have a  playmaker like Pirlo and that means Wayne can take a more central role on Thursday. People will say ‘why should we accommodate him?’ when Sterling was so impressive in that role against Italy.

I just feel with Uruguay’s defence in disarray after the defeat to Costa Rica, Sterling could terrorise whoever plays at right-back in the absence of the suspended Maximiliano Pereira and Wayne could wreak havoc in the middle.

Return? Luis Suarez is likely to be in the Uruguay team when they face England on Thursday after recovering from a knee injury

Another persuasive factor for Rooney to start is the fact he offers goals. He has yet to break his duck at a World Cup finals but, even so, he has got 39 for England and when he sets foot on to a pitch he will firmly believe he can score at this level.

Taking him out of the team would dilute England’s threat and it has to  be remembered the combined international tally of Welbeck, Lallana,  Milner and Barkley stands at nine — and Welbeck has eight of those. Would any of them have the same belief as Rooney?

No player should be included on the back of past glories and it is clear that Barkley and Lallana are breathing down his neck. But until he plays in his favoured central role, firm judgements about Rooney should be reserved.

Replacement: Adam Lallana could come in for Rooney if Hodgson decides to drop him for the next match

In contention: Ross Barkley could start against Uruguay after coming off the bench in the Italy match

If we do not get that performance in his favoured position it may be time to make changes but, right now, the time has come for Rooney to deliver.

He needs a performance to remind us why he was an automatic selection for so long.
