For 31 years, a committed couple celebrated their wedding anniversary at Red Lobster in Missouri.

But when the cancer-stricken husband died in March, his grieving widow decided to continue the tradition this week with her daughter.

After sharing their story with the server, the unidentified mother and daughter were shocked to find a kind handwritten note instead of the check.

The woman's son shared the heartwarming letter on Reddit under the username Coppin-it-washin-it.

'We are sorry to hear about your 
husband's passing, but we appreciate your loyalty in spending 31 years 
of your anniversary with us,' the note said.

'For our appreciation your meal is on us! We
 look forward to spending your next anniversary with us! Sincerely, Red 
Lobster & your server, Taylor.'

Taylor's moving note has gone viral on the internet, with Red Lobster and various media agencies confirming its authenticity.

'What Taylor, the server, and Chad, the manager on duty, did demonstrates how our teams live Red Lobster's core values of genuine caring and hospitality each day,' Red Lobster spokesperson Erica Ettori told News Channel 5.

'All of us at Red Lobster are truly proud of the Columbia team and appreciate their commitment to making every guest's dining experience a special one. We also extend our wishes to the family who dined with us and look forward to serving them again next year!'
