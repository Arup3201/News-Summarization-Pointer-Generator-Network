He is best known as the world's most renowned astrophysicist. 

But now Professor Stephen Hawking could soon be topping the music charts after making a cameo vocal performance on the brand new album by Pink Floyd.

The computerised voice of the acclaimed Cambridge scientist will feature on the track entitled 'Talkin Hawkin' on the new record called The Endless River.

The album, which is the band's first studio record in 20 years is one of the year's most eagerly anticipated new releases, which is due out next month.

In the song his computerised voice begins by saying: 'For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination.'

However, it isn't the first time Professor Hawking has featured on one of the band's songs.

In 1994, he appeared on the band's last studio album called The Division Bell in a song called Keep Talking.

The track featured a sample of his narration for a British Telecom commercial.

It is thought that vocalist Dave Gilmour wanted to include the narration after seeing the advert, which nearly made him weep.

Professor Hawking suffers from motor neurone disease and despite being confined to a wheelchair since the 1970s, he has produced a stream of first class research, including probably his most important contribution to cosmology.

This was the discovery of Hawking radiation, which allows a black hole to leak energy and gradually fade away to nothing. 

In the 1980s, Professor Hawking and Professor Jim Hartle, from the University of California at Santa Barbara, proposed a model of the universe which had no boundaries in space or time.

The track called Talkin Hawkin will feature on the album The Endless River, the band's first new studio album in 20 years 

The concept was described in A Brief History Of Time, which sold 25million copies worldwide.

In recent years, Professor Hawking has examined the relationship between science and religion, writing a 2010 book, Grand Design, which argues that evoking God is not necessary to explain the origins of the universe.

But he is as much a celebrity as he is a scientist, appearing on TV cartoon The Simpsons and starring in Star Trek.

Earlier this year he also produced a mathematical formula on how to take the perfect penalty in football to help boost England's chances at the World Cup.
