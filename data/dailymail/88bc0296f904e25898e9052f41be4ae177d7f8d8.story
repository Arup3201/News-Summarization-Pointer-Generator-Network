It was supposed to be Rory McIlroy who suffered from freaky Fridays but instead it was Tiger Woods whose bid to become Open champion was nearly over before the weekend after a shocking five-over-par second round of 77 at Hoylake.

After an impressive opening 69 it was not out of the question that Woods could still somehow conjure a magnificent victory in just his second tournament following major back surgery in March. In the end only a birdie at the final hole helped the 14-time major winner survive into the weekend with a score of two-over-par after two rounds - right on the cut-mark.

Alas, it was not his back that was bothering him but his achilles heel.

Woods won at Hoylake eight years ago by employing his ‘stinger’ iron of nearly every tee but in strong winds here he was forced to reach for his driver on both of the opening holes. Woods struggled to control the flight of his ball and opened with a double bogey, followed by a bogey at the second.

From then on Woods played remarkably steady golf, carding 14 pars in succession but failing to take advantage of three par fives – holes where birdies are crucial for anyone hoping to lift the game’s ultimate prize come Sunday evening.

Then, on the 17th tee, disaster struck. Woods again reached for the driver but carved it wildly out of bounds into the hospitality tents on the right. He walked down the fairway in the vain hope that his ball was playable but was soon forced back to the tee. Again Woods took driver, this time he hooked it way left and into deep rough.

A triple bogey seven was the inevitable result and suddenly the former world No 1 was scrambling to make the cut.

Woods needed a birdie at the last to ensure his place in the field at the weekend. A good drive was imperative. But, with out-of-bounds again lurking down the right, Woods opted to hit a three-wood. He nailed that down the middle of the fairway but left 261 yards for his second shot, which missed to the right of the green. A deft chip left a nervy six-footer for birdie and a chance to play at the weekend.

Hoylake held its breath. Woods had never suffered back-to-back missed cuts in his entire career, which has been built upon his ability to deliver in the tensest moments - just like this.

Typical Tiger, he nailed the putt. But with Woods just scraping through to the weekend he will now face further questions over whether his driver swing will ever again be able to deliver the four majors he still needs to overtake Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18.

'I got off to a terrible start
 again,' Woods said. 'And I had some opportunities to make a few birdies along the way
 to get back to even par for the day, and I just never did. I just never
 made anything. I had myself in good positions to make birdies, and I 
just didn't do it.'

Woods is still hopeful of a victory, and referred to Paul Lawrie's heroics at the 1999 Open, when the Scot completed the biggest comeback in major championship history by recovering from 10 strokes behind in the final round, and winning the subsequent three-man play off against Justin Leonard and Jean van de Velde.

'I'm pretty far back. Luckily I've got two rounds to go. And hopefully I can do something like Paul did in '99. He made up, I think, ten in one day. Hopefully I can play well on the weekend and at least give myself a shot at going to the back nine on Sunday.'

McIlroy, meanwhile, shot a second successive 66 to move to 12-under-par and heads into the weekend 14 shots ahead of Woods.
