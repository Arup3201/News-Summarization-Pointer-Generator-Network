Leaping from high cliffs into dangerous, crocodile-infested waters - these are the moments a herd of gnus put their lives at risk as they migrate in search of food.

Many of the animals, also known as wildebeest, do not make it out alive as they take the treacherous leap of faith down the sheer ridge 

The stunning shots were taken in the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya  by French photography duo Laurent Renaud and Dominique Haution.

Leap of faith: The gnus jump from the high, sheer cliff face into crocodile-infested waters as they migrate in search of food and drinking water

Treacherous times: One gnu plunges head-first into the muddy river (left) while another slips and gets stuck down a crack in the cliff (right)

All creatures great and small: A herd of zebras joins the gnus, also known as wildebeest, as they make a slightly easier crossing through a river

Sure-footed: The gnus have to be extremely careful as they descend the steep cliff face that they do not land badly and kill or injure themselves

I believe I can fly: A brave gnu soars from the edge of the rocks and into the water below, before trying to swim across to safety 

Pack mentality: The gnus travel in herds, as this makes it easier from them to overcome obstacles together and to protect the young and weak

'The gnus need to make the dangerous trip down the cliff and across the river, so they don't run out of food when the winter months come,' Mr Renaud said.

'The gnus throw themselves off the ridge and some get stuck into the ridges of the cliffs, which is jaw-dropping to watch.'

The animals' migration starts at the end of the East African rainy season, as they go off in search of drinking water and food, and they come back months later when the rain also returns.

Stunning: The incredible photographs were captured by French duo Laurent Renaud and Dominique Haution in the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya

What goes down must come up: The herd of gnus make their way up the bank after crossing the river (left) while one makes a huge leap down the cliff (right)

Making a splash: One of the migrating beats has a very sloppy landing as it slips from the cliff face and falls backwards into the river

Far more graceful: Another gnu looks far more comfortable as it leaps elegantly into the waters below to join its companions

You're next: A group of gnus, including some young, stand at the edge of the cliff and wait their turns to undertake the terrifying ordeal

To tackle the obstacles that are presented to them, they travel in large herds, learning from and protecting each other.

They protect the smaller, weaker members of the group from predators by keeping them in the middle of the herd, and having the strongest animals on the outsides. 

Mr Renaud and Ms Haution have been taking pictures together for over 20 years and they come to the Kenyan reserve every year to try and capture the incredible shots.

Ms Haution said: 'We know when the gnus are going to migrate so we set our cameras up and just wait to see what happens.

'It is always so exciting and an incredible experience. I can't wait to go back and watch it next year.'
