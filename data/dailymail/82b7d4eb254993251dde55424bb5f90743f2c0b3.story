Tottenham scouts are monitoring Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette.

The much-coveted 23-year-old has been in excellent form this season with 24 goals in all competitions. 

The France international has scored an impressive 13 goals in his last 11 games, although he has drawn a blank in the last two of those. 

Tottenham have sent scouts to watch Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette ahead of a possible move

Newcastle United attempted to sign him last year but he is keen to move to a side that can compete in the Champions League. 

Liverpool and Manchester City have also monitored his performances alongside Lyon's other star attraction Nabil Fekir.

Lacazette is tipped to become as good if not better than compatriot Karim Benzema and Lyon face a battle to hold onto him in the summer.

Tottenham watched him in the match against Lille which Lyon lost 2-1 but they remain a point ahead of rivals Paris St Germain at the top of the French league. 

Lacazette has been in superb form for Lyon this season, scoring 24 goals in 26 games so far
