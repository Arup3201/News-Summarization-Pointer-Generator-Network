Gabby thinks she might have left it too late. 'It's not looking likely,' she admits

She feared she might never become a 
mother after failing to conceive a child naturally. Then a lengthy 
course of IVF led to Gabby Logan having twins.

But
 despite longing for a third baby, the 40 year-old TV presenter says she
 will not endure more fertility treatment– even if it is her final 
chance at motherhood.

Mrs 
Logan, pictured, who suffered a near-fatal haemorrhage after giving 
birth to twins Lois and Reuben in 2005, said she and husband Kenny, 41, 
had forced themselves to accept that their family will not grow any 
bigger.

'I would have loved to have more children and I do feel broody sometimes,' she says.

'My brother has a one-year-old son and he's adorable. Every time I see him, I want to have a baby. But I think I might have left it too late now, it's not looking likely.

'I wouldn't go through IVF again. It's such a desperate thing to say but, if we could have had more children, then I am pretty sure we would have had more children.

'But I think we're at the end of the road now.

‘It is hard when you don’t get pregnant naturally, but Kenny and I feel blessed with what we have.’

Mrs
 Logan also told Closer magazine how getting older had made her more 
relaxed about her body. ‘I might be 40 but I do feel confident about my 
figure,’ she said.

‘When you
 are older you just think, “Oh what the heck!” I feel healthier and 
that’s important to me. I keep in shape by following a balanced diet and
 doing swimming and cardio.’

In an interview with the Mail last week, Gabby said her biggest disappointment is not having more children.

'I’d love to have had more children,' she said.

'If we’d been able to have children 
naturally, my husband Kenny and I would definitely have had more. 
Another couple would have been lovely. But that decision was out of our 
hands.'

Gabby
 endured a gruelling 36-hour labour with twins Reuben and Lois, now 
eight, and just about pulled through after haemorrhaging badly.

'I
 began losing blood. I am not sure exactly what caused it, but 
haemorrhaging is a possible side effect of a multiple birth,' she said.

She recalls feeling 'extremely tired and as if I was drifting away' before she lapsed into 
semi-consciousness.

After being rushed into the nearby operating theatre, surgeons battled 
for nearly three hours to save her life.
