A 50-year-old Republican Senator is the best-looking person in Washington politics, according to the latest edition of an annual list naming the capital's hottest residents.

Jeff Flake, from Arizona, beat a number of younger contenders including Oprah Winfrey's goddaughter Kirby Bumpus to clinch the top spot in The Hill's '50 Most Beautiful' list, which was released today.

But overall it was the Democrats who triumphed in this year's rankings, taking 26 places on the list compared to 16 for the GOP.

The list - which once featured Barack Obama as a young Senator - is compiled by soliciting 
nominations from Washington insiders who read the political newspaper, 
with staff then picking out the winners from a shortlist of 500.

As
well as high-profile Senators, Congressmen and TV anchors, junior 
employees working in the legislative and executive branches are also 
eligible for the honour.

Just
over half those named to the list - which was evenly split between men 
and women - were Democrats, with 16 Republicans and eight who are not 
affiliated to any party.

However,
this dominance is more likely to be due to the larger number of 
Democrats currently working in the capital, with the party controlling 
the White House and the Senate.

Runners-up: Hawaii Congressman Tulsi Gabbard, left, and White House chef Sam Kass, right, came in sixth and third place respectively

Pioneers: Sara and Chellie Zou of C-SPAN are the first pair of twins the list, in fourth and fifth place

1) Jeff Flake, 50, Arizona Senator

2) Kirby Bumpus, 27, Department of Health and Human Services

3) Sam Kass, 33, White House chef

4) Sara Zou, 24, C-SPAN

5) Chellie Zou, 24, C-SPAN

6) Tulsi Gabbard, 32, Hawaii Congressman

7) Eric Ortega, 26, congressional aide

8) Zack Condry, 30, Republican strategist

9) Julie Goldfarb, 27, congressional aide

10) Alisha Johnson, 28, Environmental Protection Agency

Among the Democratic lawmakers 
to make the list are 32-year-old Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii in sixth place,
dashing Texan Beto O'Rourke, and Florida's 70-year-old Congressman 
Frederica Wilson.

In the Senate, by contrast, it seems to be freshmen from the GOP who are capturing observers' hearts.

Mr Flake, elected last year to represent Arizona, and South Carolina's Tim
Scott, the first African-American to represent the state for more than a
century, both made it on to the list.

Number
one pick Mr Flake is known for looking younger than his 50 years, which
he attributes to a healthy lifestyle, and also for his efforts in pushing immigration reform.

He
is a devout Mormon, meaning he has never consumed alcohol, tobacco, 
coffee or tea - although he admits to having a weakness for ice cream 
and Diet Coke.

The Senator 
is also a survival fanatic - when he was a member of the House of 
Representatives, he spent a week alone on the Marshall Islands, and 
earlier this year he took his two sons back to the area for a vacation 
adventure.

Dominance: Democrats such as Frederica Wilson, left, and Beto O'Rourke, right, form a majority on the list

Dashing: CNN's Jake Tapper, left, and Senator Tim Scott, right, have also been honoured

From the media, Jake Tapper will 
doubtless be delighted to see that his new job hosting The Lead on CNN 
has not gone unrecognised by Capitol Hill aesthetes.

Less
high-profile figures from the world of TV to make the list include 
Claire Shipman and Mary Bruce of ABC, while Sara and Chellie Zou, 
production assistants at C-SPAN, are the first pair of identical twins 
ever to receive the accolade, placing fourth and fifth respectively.

White
House nutrition adviser Sam Kass will surely be one of the most 
sought-after names on the list - in addition to the good looks which 
propelled him to number three, he is an experienced professional chef.

Other
heartthrobs who have caught the eye of their DC colleagues include Miss
Bumpus, the daughter of CBS's Gayle King and Oprah Winfrey's 
goddaughter, who works at the Department of Health and Human Services, 
and Sam Sanchez, son of Filipino pop star Keno.

Couple: ABC journalist Claire Shipman, left, is on the list - but her husband Jay Carney, right, is not

This year sees the 10th anniversary of the list, which is hotly anticipated every year by insiders.

'For
the last 10 years, we've enjoyed letting our hair down in showcasing 
people who, some high-profile, some not so, most importantly have great 
personal stories to tell,' says Hugo Gurdon, editor-in-chief of The 
Hill.

'We're 
extraordinarily proud to mark a decade of what's become a mainstay for 
DC and political enthusiasts, and look forward to 10 more years.'

Pennsylvania was the best-represented state, with five entries, followed by four each from Texas and New Jersey.

In
addition to Mr Obama, entrants on previous editions of the list include
failed presidential candidate Michele Bachmann and GOP White House 
hopeful Marco Rubio.
