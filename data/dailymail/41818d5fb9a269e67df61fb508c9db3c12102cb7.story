Pre-Christmas tension looks to be striking couriers earlier than usual this year in Australia as their shoddy delivery of packages is the latest ‘breaking’ news across the country.

It was anyone's guess what else was broken when this TNT delivery driver was filmed dropping large packages from the back of his truck in the middle of Sydney on Wednesday afternoon.

9News reported that the delivery man was filmed carelessly dropping several boxes to the ground on Pitt Street. Some even bounced off others as they fell to the ground. 

The TNT driver carries out his delivery by leaning out of his van and dropping a package to the floor

The driver sends the package flying through the air and towards the ground

All the driver can do is watch as the package hits the ground heavily

It's not clear what was in the boxes or if they contained fragile goods – not that the large bald-headed driver seemed to care anyway. The company has been contacted for comment but has not replied.

A video was posted to YouTube by Bob Vance with one comment saying: ‘What a s****y human being.’

The driver then decides to just shove packages out onto the ground from the van to save time

With four packages scattered on the ground the driver goes back into the truck to get more

The incident follows a similar one that took place on November 4 in Adelaide. Footage again shows couriers recklessly throwing packages. It had over half a million views in a day.

The clip was posted on Facebook by a 'Pinky BuaChompoo', the alias used by an Adelaide kick boxer, who filmed the scene from inside a car at Adelaide Airport.

It shows three men in high visibility shirts carelessly hurling the parcels against the back of a DHL truck.

The man that uploaded the video, who chose to remain anonymous, told Herald Sun he was angered by what he witnessed.

'The reason why it bothers me is that I send stuff all the time internationally and domestically and the stuff ends up in damaged boxes.

'Now I know why, so this is my little protest.' 

A spokesperson for DHL confirmed the clip was legitimate.

'DHL is obviously shocked to see the handling of the shipments in such a way,' she said.

'It's contrary to all of our policies and has spurred us to really prompt action.'

A spokesperson for DHL said they are shocked by the video, and have taken prompt action

DHL said that only one of the men in the video is employed by their company, and has not been stood down as a result of the video

'We are working closely with the contractor so that those suppliers are aware of the gravity of what has been done here.' 

They said that only one of the men in the video is employed by DHL, and the employee has not been 'stood down' as a result of the video. 

Similar videos have surfaced in the past, prompting the creation of community pages such as 'Don't Throw My Package', which expose couriers  mishandling packages.

The site lists on it's Facebook page it was 'born in an effort to showcase, reveal and rectify the modern-day mishandling of human-delivered packages.'
