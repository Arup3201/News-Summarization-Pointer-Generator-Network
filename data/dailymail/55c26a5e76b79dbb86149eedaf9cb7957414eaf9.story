Notorious 'serial stowaway' Marilyn Jean Hartman has struck again.

The 63-year-old California resident was arrested Monday in Jacksonville, Florida, after she allegedly snuck onto a flight from Minneapolis Sunday by using someone else's identity.

Once in Jacksonville, the woman allegedly used a fake name, Maria Sandgren, to get transportation to Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort, where she checked into a $300-a-night villa. 

But her triumph was short-lived: Hartman fled hours later when the real guest showed up at the hotel.

She's baaack! Notorious 'serial stowaway' Marilyn Jean Hartman, 63, was arrested in Florida after allegedly sneaking onto a flight and then checking into a posh resort using someone else's name 

The fleet-footed senior citizen was discovered by security guards the following day hiding in a vacant room that was been renovated, reported NBC News. 

Hartman has been charged with felony fraud, defrauding an innkeeper and misdemeanor trespassing. She is due back in court Tuesday. 

The stowaway's long criminal record lists numerous similar incidents involving boarding flights without a ticket and entering places under false pretense. 

In August 2014 alone she was arrested no fewer than three times.

Hartman has blamed her penchant for sneaking onto planes on an unrecognized medical condition she called 'whistleblower trauma syndrome. 

According to the woman, she was a whistleblower who was forced by the FBI to flee her home, forcing her to live on the streets. 

Police picked her up at Sky Harbor International Airport August 26 on suspicion of criminal trespass after officials noticed her loitering near the baggage claim. 

Repeat offender: In August 2014, Hartman was arrested no fewer than three times, including at Phoenix airport

Just two weeks earlier, Hartman was ordered to spend 117 days in jail 13 for a probation violation after she was spotted at Los Angeles International Airport when a court had banned from the premises just days earlier.

However Hartman - who is said to have a 'fixation' on airports because they make her feel safe - was released Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood on August 16 - just three days later -  due to overcrowding.

It is unclear how she made it from L.A. to Phoenix in the last 10 days. 

After her August arrest in Phoenix, the 63-year-old wondered aloud at a press conference, 'Why has the government allowed me to get past security points?' 

Hartman, who has made previous attempts 
to sneak aboard flights at other airports, was arrested August 4 after successfully taking a Southwest Airlines flight from San Jose to Los Angeles without a
 ticket. 

At Mineta San Jose International Airport, Hartman tried at least three times to get to a plane before she finally went past a security screener who was busy checking a family's documents, law enforcement officials said.

She later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft and was sentenced to two years of probation.

Her boarding status was discovered once the Southwest flight landed in Los Angeles, the officials said.

Hartman later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft. A judge ordered her to stay away from LAX unless she had a valid ticket.

Outside
 the courthouse after sentencing, Hartman said she would never try to sneak 
onto a plane again.

'It was stupid, and it is something I don't want to 
repeat,' she said.

She added, 'Obviously they'll be on watch for me so I wouldn't dare attempt this again. I don't want to be that position. I want to go with a paid ticket,' reported News4Jax at the time.   

However, 
Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said he had a feeling 
the woman 'with a fixation on flying' would return to LAX, so police 
passed out fliers with her picture.

Can't stop: Hartman was sentenced to 18 months probation for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound flights last year. She spent three days in jail

'She was (then) seen wandering through several terminals in what appeared to be a scouting mission,' he said.

In February, Hartman was sentenced to 18 months' probation in San Mateo County after being arrested for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound flights at San Francisco International Airport on three separate days. 

Her breach of security at the San Jose airport caused federal officials and the airline to launch investigations.

It also prompted criticism of the airport in light of the trespassing of a teenage boy who stowed away in the wheel well of a Hawaiian Airlines flight and survived an arduous journey to Maui.

Hartman, who authorities say has a history of mental illness, has now been arrested eight times for trespassing at airports this year - though this is the first time she's been caught after successfully boarding a flight.

She said last week that homelessness drove her to take 'desperate measures,' and that she feels safer being in airports than in the streets.

San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said that Hartman has no family and has never married.

According to a her blog, found by the San Francisco Chronicle, she has lived in sketchy motels and squalid apartments from Seattle to San Diego in the last few years.

Records indicate Hartman was arrested November 6, 2010, at the Lihue Airport in Kauai after trespassing into the baggage claim area, the Chronicle reported. She was charged with simple trespass, but failed to show up for court hearings - and remains the subject of a bench warrant.

Plane fixation: Hartman tried at least three times to breach airport security before she was able to get through a checkpoint without a boarding pass at Mineta San Jose International Airport  August 4

According to the newspaper, Hartman said in her blog that she had successfully hopped a plane once before. She was found out and detained - but later released without charge.

In May - after being arrested seven times at San Francisco International Airport - Hartman was placed in a mental treatment program but she stopped attending last month.

'She declined all of our efforts to offer her assistance,' Wagstaffe said.

'And we tried all of the alternatives we had because we weren't interested in locking her up on our end.'

Then she went back to the San Francisco airport, but Wagstaffe's office declined to file charges after her seventh arrest in July for another failed attempt.

On Monday, Hartman was only caught after the plane landed at Los Angeles International Airport and the crew counted the passengers who remained on board for the final destination to Phoenix.

She was hauled off the plane and charged with trespassing by the Los Angeles Police Department.
