A former beauty queen has swapped pageantry for selling hot dogs, snapping up a job aboard the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.

Alexandra Longo, who was crowned Miss Addison, Chicago, in 2010, was scouted by the firm in her final semester at the University of Wisconsin at Madison last April.

And she loves it.

 She's no baloney! Alexandra Longo, Miss Addison, Chicago, was recruited for the Wienermobile at college

Swapping pageantry for fast food: She said she didn't realize how exciting and interesting the job would be

'My initial thought was that I didn't go to college so I could hand out hot dogs for the rest of my life, but that's not what this job is about,' she told the Chicago Tribune.

She started with driving lessons, getting to grips with the enormous wheeled sausage.

Then it was on the road for Longo.

With her colleagues, she has toured across the North and Midwest - and even pitched up in Times Square, New York.

Crowned: This is the moment in 2010 that Longo, who plans to work in public relations, won her title

On Father's Day, she surprised her parents by parking the Wienermobile outside their house.

'If we park at the front of the parking lot [at a store] people think there's an event going on,' she told the Tribune.

'As my boss tells me: "You can't sneak in anywhere in a 27-foot-long hot dog."'

Ecstatic though she is, Longo plans to sideline hot dogs this June to pursue a job in personal relations, having studied journalism at college.
