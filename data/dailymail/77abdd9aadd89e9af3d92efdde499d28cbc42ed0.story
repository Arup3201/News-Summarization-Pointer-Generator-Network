The USA 
have been one of the surprise teams of the World Cup, having qualified 
for the last 16 at the expense of Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal, but one 
thing is for sure - their fans have always believed.

And
 when the US take on Belgium on Tuesday, it will be no different. 
Thousands of American fans in  Salvador - and millions more back home - 
will believe they can reach the quarter finals and will proudly declare 
so.

'I
 believe that we will win, I believe that we will win, I believe that we
 will win,' will ring out around the Arena Fonte Nova.

Support: An American fans holds up a banner with the famous 'I believe that we will win' message

Stars and stripes... and scarves: The American fans show their colours at the start of the match

Doubling up: This fan in Natal was showing he support for the United States and Colombia

Talking tactics: Jurgen Klinsmann (centre) addresses his players during training on Monday in Brazil

Warming up: Michael Bradley (centre) and his team-mates get down to the serious business of training

The
 simple, yet surprisingly rousing, chant has become a hit in America, 
with celebrities such as Will Ferrell and Kevin Costner starring in TV 
adverts aimed at inspiring the nation to get in to the World Cup spirit.
  

The fervor has clearly caught on with the song now the unofficial chant of Jurgen Klinsmann's side.

The chant was originally created, according to Yahoo, by Naval Academy Prep school student Jay Rodriguez, who taught it to his class-mates. In the 16 years since, it has spread from American university campuses to navy football matches and now the greatest show on earth in Brazil. 

It
 may not be the most creative of chants but it is certainly catchy and 
undoubtedly goose-bumping. It also seems to inspire, with the USA 
managing to defy expectations and make it out of a tough group they were
 expected to struggle in.

No doubt America will believe it can inspire their players to pull off another victory against Belgium on Tuesday evening.
