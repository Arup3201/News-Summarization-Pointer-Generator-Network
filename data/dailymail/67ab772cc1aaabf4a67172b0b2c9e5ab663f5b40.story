Wrexham will travel to Stoke armed with hope for their FA Cup third-round tie, even if boss Kevin Wilkin is fearful of being on the wrong end of a Britannia Stadium thrashing.

The non-league Dragons will make the trip to Stoke aiming to write another memorable FA Cup chapter in their history following on from their 1992 scalp of then-league champions Arsenal at the Racecourse.

Stoke boss Mark Hughes, who was born in the North Wales town of Ruabon - less than six miles from Wrexham, will be mindful of his hometown team causing another shock in this competition.

However, Wilkin is weary that Hughes' side have the potential to heap plenty of misery on his Vanarama Conference outfit.

'You look at anyone in the Premier League, they are all athletes, they are all big strong powerful men, and they can play a bit as well, so we are under no illusions; we know what to expect and we will take it on on the day,' he told the Daily Post.

'Clearly we will be the underdogs - a Conference side playing a Premier League side, you would expect no different. 

'We can go there with no fear, you want to go into the game with no fear but we very much respect what Stoke can do and we are very aware of what they can do to teams, and one thing you don't want to do is go there and be on the end of a real good thumping, but the gulf between what they are and the money they can spend and what we spend is huge.

'Hopefully we can have a day where things happen for us and things drop in to place and we can give a good account of ourselves, if we do that then I don't think anyone can ask for anything else from us.

'I don't think anyone is daft enough to overlook the gulf in leagues that there is between the two sides, and on the day you need things to happen for you and need a little bit of fortune on the day and if you get that then who knows what can happen?'

However, one thing Wilkin is not banking on is local lad Hughes underestimating his men.

'I am sure Mark won't take anything for granted, and that is the reason why they are having such a fantastic season and Mark Hughes is the manager he is,' he added.

'He is very professional in everything he does and if we can learn one or two things off him as we go along then hopefully it will stand us in good stead for the rest of the season.'
