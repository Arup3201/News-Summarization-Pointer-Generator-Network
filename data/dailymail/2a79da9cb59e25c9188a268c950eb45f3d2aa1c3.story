It is one of the most enduring and baffling crime mysteries of modern times: The disappearance and murder of candy heiress Helen Brach.

The horse-loving Helen, who inherited a multi-million dollar fortune from her husband, Frank, vanished in 1977, following a visit to a clinic in Minnesota, for a routine medical check up.

No-one has ever been convicted in connection with her disappearance.

But now recently revealed documents, and the claims of a former federal investigator, show that there is evidence and testimony that may finally solve the mystery.

Brach, it is alleged in the documents, was kidnapped, beaten, shot and her body disposed of in a steel furnace, on the orders of a notorious Chicagoland horse dealer.

Missing: Horse-loving Helen Brach, who inherited a multi-million dollar fortune from her husband, Frank, vanished in 1977, following a visit to a clinic in Minnesota, for a routine medical check up

Implicated: Richard Bailey was a well-known Chicago lothario who took up with the rich widow

How sweet it is : Brach's Confections was founded in 1904 by Emil J. Brach, the father of Helen's husband. He opened a candy store and factory in Chicago, the building used in the 2008 film The Dark Knight

Treats: The company's first product was caramels, but they are best known for their candy corn

The heiress, 65 when she disappeared and a dealer in horses herself, had stumbled into the dark underbelly of the trade, discovered major fraud and, it was feared by the plotters, was going to tell all.

It was an insurance fraud, where highly-prized horses, many of them show jumpers, were killed for cash.

A new book Who Killed the Candy Lady? by James Ylisela and published by Agate has brought together all the evidence – and sheds doubt on the involvement of the one man serving a prison sentence linked to the murder, Brach's lover, a sweet-talking conman called Richard Bailey.

Bailey, now 85, is in a federal prison in Florida serving a 30-year sentence. He pleaded guilty to a federal racketeering charge, being part of an ongoing conspiracy to cheat elderly women out of their money.

But, in an unusual sentencing hearing in 1995, the judge agreed to hear claims from prosecutors of his involvement in the murder of Helen Brach.

And the judge agreed, on the preponderance of evidence rather than beyond reasonable doubt, that Bailey was involved in her disappearance and murder. 

On that basis, the judge handed down the 30 year sentence, 20 for his alleged involvement in Brach's murder. 

Brach's disappearance nearly three decades ago continues to fascinate.

The former hat check girl from Ohio, a beauty in her youth, was 38 when she met and married then 60-year-old Frank Brach, who died in 1971.

Founded in Chicago in 1904 by Frank's father, Emile J., the brand was arguably best known through its jingle 'Stop where you are, buy a Brach's candy bar'.

Following the death of her husband, and living alone in her home on the north shore of Chicago, Brach began to get involved in selling and buying horses.

And this was how she stumbled into a world of deeply unsavory characters involved in fraud, implicated in murder and with links to the Chicago Mob.

It was also how she met the smooth- talking conman named Richard Bailey.

Ylisela, a Chicago-based author, has been following the story for some 15 years, driven by the belief that Richard Bailey had nothing to do with the disappearance, or murder, of Brach.

'The reason I was fascinated is because it's a story with everything,' Ylisela said.

'It's got bad guys, commen, gigolos, horse thieves, an heiress, money and murder. This makes it a complicated story because there are so many characters, You could not make them up.'

Ylisela writes: 'Richard Bailey is an interesting character, a born conman.'

When he met the widow Brach in the mid 70s, he was already middle-aged and quite the lothario.

'He has a particular quality that things will always be better around the corner. He was friendliest, brightest inmate I have ever interviewed.'

Ylisela has interviewed Bailey in prison a number of times over the past 15 years.

'He's not a good guy but one thing I do not think he is, is a murderer.'

Ylisela believes, based on the recently revealed documents obtained by the author and interviews with a former federal investigator, that Brach became a victim of a sinister 'horse mafia' that operated for decades in the Chicagoland area.

For much of that time it was led by an individual named Silas Jayne, the head of a family of horse dealers.

Jayne, who died in the mid 1980s, was implicated in a series of murders, and convicted of conspiracy to murder his own brother.

Jayne is a central figure in the files detailing what two senior investigators, John Rutonno, recently retired from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and John O'Connell, of the Cook County state's attorney's office, believe happened.

The files were produced following an investigation carried out ten years ago after an individual named Joseph Plemmons came forward with claims he knew exactly how Brach was killed and her body disposed of.

Horsing around: All fingers point to Silas Jayne as the man who was responsible for Brach's disappearance and death, says the author. His motive: Helen had discovered his insurance fraud scheme

Guilty? Helen's houseman Jack Matlick, appeared at a probate hearing in 1984 to determine if Brach should be declared legally dead. But he was implicated in Brach's disappearance by an eyewitness

Plemmons, who alleged he was part of the gang that kidnapped and killed Brach, implicates Jayne, claiming the notorious horse dealer ordered Brach's murder from his prison cell, where he was serving time for conspiracy to murder his brother,

Plemmons named names of those involved in the plot, a motley, and pretty nasty, crew including Brach's long time house man Jack Matlick, long a prime suspect in her disappearance.

Plemmons is still alive and living in Florida. Two others, Frank Jr, and Lee Reiter, the police officer, are also still living. Neither of the two would speak to the author.

Plemmons tale, and the painstaking efforts of investigators to independently verify his claims, is laid out in gruesome detail in the files produced by the investigation but only recently revealed.

Brach was targeted after she threatened to reveal to authorities details of a major fraud involving horses orchestrated by Silas Jayne.

Horses were bought and insured, then killed for the insurance money.

The elderly heiress was beaten, shot point blank and her body disposed of in a blast furnace in an Indiana steel plant, according to Plemmons.

Crucially, Ylisela argues, Bailey is not implicated in the gruesome plot. His name does not appear in the files,

But following the investigation, no further action was taken by prosecutors.

Target: Helen got involved in the horse trade and came across a scheme run by mobsters where horses were bought, insured and then killed for the insurance money

Innocent: The author has been following the case for some 15 years, driven by the belief that Richard Bailey had nothing to do with the disappearance, or murder, of Brach

The home where Helen Brach lived in Chicago

Rutonno, the former ATF agent deeply frustrated at the failure to pursue the prosecution following Plemmons' 2005 revelations, said there was still a chance, probably the last, to solve this great crime mystery.

Rutonno told Ylisela: 'There is no secret to the Brach case. We know how, we know why and we know where. I'll go to my grave knowing that we had it done.'

Ylisela believes Bailey was the victim of a system and federal prosecutors who wanted the crime solved.

He believes that Bailey should be released from the Coleman federal correction institution, not least because of his age.

'He long ago served his 10 years for fraud. The extra time was a sentence for the Brach murder. But he's served enough even on that. The fact is they were wrong to add that time.'

Ylisela believes if Bailey knew anything of the murder he would long ago have revealed everything.

'Even if somewhat damaging to him, he would have played that card a long time ago and blamed anybody if he could have.'

Ylisela added: 'Bailey is not the hero by any stretch but the Feds wanted to solve this case and going after Bailey was the only way to do that.'
