These previously unseen pictures reveal the preparations in the hours leading up to the US nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

The atomic bombings of the two cities in Japan were conducted by the US during the final stages of World War Two in August 1945.

To this day, the bombings remain history's only acts of nuclear warfare.

Once the 'Fat Man' device was virtually complete, workers began to sign their names on it

By August 1945, the Allied Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory had devised two types of bombs.

The 509th Composite Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces was equipped with a Silverplate Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands, to the south of Japan.  

A uranium gun-type atomic bomb, code-named 'Little Boy', was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, followed by a plutonium implosion-type bomb, called 'Fat Man' on the city of Nagasaki on August 9.

Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the effects killed 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000–80,000 in Nagasaki. 

Almost half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. 

The completed bomb was then towed towards the airfield under cover with an escort

The bombs were placed inside this pit in Tinian in the Mariana Islands, to the south of Japan 

The bomb was lowered manually by a group of workers, some with their shirts open, towards the pit

The bomb was raised up on a hydraulic lift and the metal gutters which guided it over the pit were removed

The device is lowered in to the pit where two men work - it remained covered up for security reasons

The aircraft used to carry the device backed up slowly over the pit to collect the bomb

During the following months, large numbers died from the effect of burns, radiation sickness, and other injuries, compounded by illness. 

In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizeable garrison.

On August 15, just days after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet Union's declaration of war, Japan announced its surrender to the Allies.

The 'Little Boy' bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, killing 90,000 - 166,000 people - almost half were killed on the day it landed on the city

Three days later, the 'Fat Man' bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, which killed 60,000 - 80,000 people

The rare pictures were revealed in the same week that the US Department of Energy released transcripts of the 1950s hearings on the security clearance of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory. 

The Project developed the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

The once-celebrated physicist lost his security clearance following the four-week, closed-door hearing when he was accused of having communist sympathies. 

Transcripts were released this week of the 1950s hearings on the security clearance of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory

Oppenheimer was accused of having communist sympathies after a four week, close-door hearing 

Officials also alleged that Oppenheimer's wife and brother had both been communists and he had contributed to communist front-organizations.

Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists, said the release of the documents finally lifts the cloud of secrecy on the Oppenheimer case.

'This was a landmark case in U.S. history and Cold War history,' Mr Aftergood said. 'It represents a high point during anti-communist anxiety and tarnished the reputation of America's leading scientist.' 

After the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer served as director of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study until he retired in 1966.

President Lyndon B. Johnson later tried to erase the embarrassment of Oppenheimer's treatment by honouring him with the Atomic Energy Commission's Enrico Fermi Award in 1963.

Oppenheimer died of throat cancer in 1967.
