The Government's inquiry into historic child abuse should be scrapped and started again, a leading member of the panel overseeing the investigation has told MPs.

Ben Emmerson QC, the leading lawyer advising the inquiry, said the Home Secretary needed to disband it and set up a new investigation with statutory powers to compel people to give evidence.

He said the abuse inquiry had been undermined by internal leaks by a leading member of the panel and could no longer do its job.

Mr Emerson's remarks comes six months after the Home Secretary Theresa May first announced the inquiry.

But it has been beset by problems and has been without a chairman since November after Fiona Woolf resigned over links to the late Tory peer Lord Brittan, whose handling of abuse claims in the 1980s has been questioned.

Predecessor Baroness Butler-Sloss had resigned four months earlier, also over her links with establishment figures.

Mr Emmerson was last week accused of 'bullying' child abuse survivor Sharon Evans, who sits on the inquiry board.

Mrs Evans told MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee last Tuesday that Mr Emmerson was 'overstepping the mark with advice and rewriting of letters'.

The allegations prompted the chair of the committee, Keith Vaz, to summon the barrister to answer questions on his role in the inquiry.

Speaking this afternoon, Mr Emmerson said panel members' letters 'were not my responsibility', and accused Ms Evans of publishing 'misleading statements that have had an impact on the work of the inquiry'.

He also claimed his fellow panel member was behind the 'leaking' of a Home Office letter sent to panel members on December 15.

In a frank exchange between Mr Emmerson and the committee chair, the human rights lawyer accused Ms Evans of a 'breach of confidentiality', describing the row as a 'terrible distraction from the really crucial and vitally important work that the panel has been trying to do in difficult circumstances'.

In earlier responses to Ms Evans accusations, the remaining members of the inquiry said they had 'full confidence in the integrity, advice and impartiality' of the lawyer in his role as 'facilitator' while a new chair is appointed.

Mr Emmerson also rejected claims that he had 'intimidated' Ms Evans as 'entirely baseless' and 'unfounded'.

The leaked letter last week revealed that the Home Secretary Theresa May was considering disbanding the panel.

Mrs May could set up a new inquiry panel under statutory terms. In a letter to the panel members, she said: 'I am currently considering these options and I appreciate this has implications for members of the panel.'

Mrs Emmerson said it is his assessment that the panel cannot do its work because of Evans conduct.

Although she is a survivor herself, what she has done has not served the interests of survivors, he said.
