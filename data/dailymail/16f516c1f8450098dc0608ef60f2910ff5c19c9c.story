She's rockstar royalty who grew up around Kate Moss, modelled for Chanel and counts Cara Delevingne and Harry Styles as her best friends - is Daisy Lowe Britain's coolest young model?

It would seem so. American Eagle Outfitters - a popular US clothing brand -  wanted to tap into the magic so snapped the 25-year-old up to front its latest campaign - and she couldn't be happier about it.

'It's my perfect aesthetic,' she told MailOnline of her new campaign. 'The clothes are comfortable and cool and exactly what I wear myself. I am London born and bred so I am hoping to bring that edge to the campaign.'

Daisy, who grew up in Camden with mother Pearl Lowe, showcases the trendy label's denim shirts, cosy beanie hats and skinny jeans in the shoot.

Exuding an edgy but relaxed vibe, Daisy says the whole campaign is an accurate reflection of her own style, which was shaped by trips to Portobello Road market with her mother.

'My mum would always take me to the market and buy these lace dresses and Dr. Martens. I felt like a Victorian witch at the time but it's actually shaped my style and I really love my mother's dress sense, it's amazing,' she said.

One person she doesn't take style advice from is best friend and fellow model and muse, Alexa Chung.

'We're best friends, we don't sit around giving each other style advice. She does obviously have amazing style and always look brilliant though,' she adds. 

Daisy and Alexa are part of what's been dubbed 'the new Primrose Hill set', along with Nick Grimshaw, Harry Styles, Pixie Geldof and Cara Delevingne. They frequent the capital's hottest parties, set the trends and have a good time doing it - but you won't catch Daisy taking it for granted. 

She relishes every opportunity and still gets starstruck despite her starry roster of pals.

Daisy, who cites walking in Burberry's show as her ultimate career coup, said: 'Meeting Tom Ford was pretty unreal. I couldn't believe my luck at wearing his clothes. He said to me "You look amazing and you smell amazing", it was unreal,' she gushed.

Despite being one of Britain's most famous clothes horses, Daisy doesn't starve herself and recently penned a cookbook, Sweetness and Light, full of healthy recipes.

Speaking about her diet, she said: 'I like to do everything in moderation but I'm certainly no angel! The horrible food guilt feeling is the reason I wrote my book, it's the worst! 

'When I eat wheat and sugar, I can actually feel it and it feels like I've been badly behaved. If I eat chocolate, I notice a spot from it a few days later.'

Instead, she created recipes such as  goji berry chocolates, which are a big hit with her pals who raid her fridge for her healthy treats when they come over.

'I wanted to share self-loving recipes with the world. As a society, we are so self-depricating and I wanted to find a way we could feel good,' she added. 

Staying trim: Daisy says she is no angel but credits healthy treats, swimming and meditation for her balanced lifestyle 

She also credits working out four times a week, swimming classes and pilates as the secrets behind her healthy figure. Meditation, which has become a favourite amongst celebrities in recent months, is also key to her lifestyle.

'My godmother got me into it. After she started doing it, I noticed a stillness behind her eyes, a quiet calmness that I wanted.'

It took Daisy four months to master the art but now she meditates twice a day - on trains, in hair and makeup and in taxis - and says it helps the flow of her day.

So what's next for the in-demand young star? 'I have plans but I'm keeping them to myself,' she said.

'I keep my wishes to myself because if I tell anyone, then they might not come true.'
