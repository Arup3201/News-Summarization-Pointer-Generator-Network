Teacher Margareta Dragut has been charged with allegedly forcing young women and girls into prostitution

A Romanian teacher has been charged with allegedly forcing forcing young women and girls into prostitution.

Award-winning teacher Margareta Dragut allegedly trafficked young women she sold into prostitution.

Prosecutors this week confirmed they were charging her and her boyfriend Claudiu Giorsan Belecciu, the alleged ringleader of a trafficking gang.

They say that they have identified a number of suspected victims, but police believe there may be more and confirmed that they were still looking to identify as many of these other victims as possible.

They are investigating whether the alleged victims included schoolgirls that she had worked with directly - or whether it was only young girls from other schools.

A police spokesman said: 'It is highly likely she used her position in teaching to groom young women for prostitution.'

Colleagues of Dragut, 41, who worked at the Mihai Eminescu high-school in the Romanian city of Constanta, were reportedly shocked at her arrest in January.

The school principal Camelia Ciurescu said: 'On Friday she came to school as usual, she never missed a lesson and never ever had a professional problem.

'I did not expect her to do that. Although we assume charges are not directly related to her teaching activity, we can not ignore them because they are so serious.'

Prosecutors claim she worked with her boyfriend Belecciu, 47, who was also the trafficking gang leader, and that she posted adverts and photos on the internet offering underage schoolgirls who were working in the 'Pink Cats' massage parlour in the city of Constanta, and in other resorts on the Black Sea.

Prosecutors also claim members of the group had people helping them in other state institutions, including two police officers, Lucian Borcea and Nicolae Peniu, who had the role of protecting the suspects and escorting prostitutes to their meetings.

All the male members of the gang are still behind bars in investigative custody, while Dragut has been the only member of the gang released on bail.

The identities of Dragut and her boyfriend were exposed following police raids at the massage parlour and the homes of gang members.

Prosecutors say the group members began their business recruiting young girls in 2012.
