A teenager who harboured a deep-seated hatred of the lower classes has been jailed for two years after he drove his van into a man drinking outside a pub.

Duncan McAlpine, 19, claimed he wanted simply to frighten the pub patrons, whom he described as beer-drinking football-watching 'dossers', after two of them ‘humiliated’ him by intervening in an argument with his girlfriend, the court was told.

But his van slammed into 49-year-old Terry Canavan, who was flung across the street, leaving him with 'life-changing injuries’.

And when he called 999, McAlpine, who was living opposite the pub in Old Woking, Surrey, at the time, told police: 'I look out the window every day and they’re standing there with their pints of Stella and their packets of pork scratchings watching the football - it’s all they do. It’s like they are a bunch of dossers.'

Wendy Cottee, prosecuting, said he ‘looked down on these sort of people’ and the unpleasant comments were indicative of his attitude.

Jailing him, at Guildford Crown Court, Judge Peter Moss told him: 'What you did was unforgiveable. No sentence I can impose can right the wrong you have done to Mr Canavan - which is very severe.'

He said McAlpine, whose father Ian runs one of the UK’s leading equestrian centres, had used his van as a weapon and driven it at the crowded pub 'with appalling consequences' to the victim who just happened to be in the way.

Mr Canavan has been left without a sense of taste or smell and is deaf in one ear, and is unable to work as a result of the injuries he had sustained.

He also sustained a fractured cheek and experienced problems with his vision.

Judge Moss told McAlpine: 'He has suffered very seriously at your hands.'

The court was told the incident happened on May 7 this year, when Mr Canavan and his friend Ben Ryan intervened after witnessing what they thought was the defendant assaulting his pregnant partner Vicky Brackley, outside the Kingfield Arms pub in Old Woking.

In the process McAlpine was knocked to the ground and made to look foolish with the pub customers laughing at him, the court heard.

McAlpine, who said he suffered from spinal problems from a young age and feared assault in case it would leave him paralysed, said the incident had brought back memories of being bullied as a child.

Jurors were told that McAlpine, who 
suffered from Asperger’s Syndrome, was bullied so often that he 
frequently had to change schools, leaving him with a fear of 
humiliation.

And it was this that led to him ‘completely losing control’ when he saw what he regarded as 'nasty working men' escorting his partner away.

'He was blinded by rage,' Ms Cottee said.

The situation was not helped by the hatred he felt for drinkers at the Kingfield Arms. Ms Cottee told the court: 'The defendant looked down on these sort of people.'

She said it was the defendant’s desire to get his own back which led to him driving his van at the patrons of the Kingfield Arms with such appalling consequences.

She added that if McAlpine’s vehicle had ploughed into the pub or the party of customers drinking outside the building, the outcome could have been unimaginable. 'It would have been a massacre.’

McAlpine admitted threatening to smash up cars belong to people at the pub. But he added: 'I never meant to hit anyone.'

He said he had only driven his Ford Transit at the pub to frighten the customers there. 'I wanted to scare them. But Mr Canavan leapt in front of my van,' he said.

Ms Cottee added, however, that there was evidence that McAlpine’s vehicle had mounted the pavement by the pub.

Mr Canavan was unconscious for two weeks after being hit by the defendant’s van and suffered a fractured skull which caused internal bleeding into his brain, the court was told.

In evidence to the court, the defendant’s mother Ms Annee Charland described her son as a bright boy but someone who found it difficult to make friends of his own age.

McAlpine, whose father runs Painshill Farm Stables in Cranleigh, Surrey, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and causing grievous bodily harm.

The defendant had been acquitted by a jury after a week-long trial of a separate charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent - an allegation which he had denied.

But Judge Moss said the offences which McAlpine had admitted were serious enough.

After studying reports on the defendant, the judge described him as a 'volatile' young man.

'His views on the world are very ego-centric. He finds it very difficult to see things from the point of view of other people,' said Judge Moss.

He added that it was time that the defendant 'grew up' instead of trying to shelter behind his undoubted psychological difficulties.

David Castle, defending, said his client had found life on remand in custody very tough indeed.

'He has been subject to bullying. He was beaten up and spent two days in the infirmary,' he said.

Referring to the jail term that McAlpine faced, Mr Castle said: 'It’s a sentence that he’s going to find extremely difficult to serve.' McAlpine was also banned from driving for 18 months.
