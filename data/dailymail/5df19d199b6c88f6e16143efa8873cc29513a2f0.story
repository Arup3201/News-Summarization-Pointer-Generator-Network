Liverpool's stars have been taking in the sights of Boston on their pre-season tour, but Glen Johnson and Pepe Reina got a little more than they bargained for.

England right-back Johnson uploaded a photo of the Reds duo to his official Twitter account, but was surprised at the stranger - complete with big hair and face-paint - in the background.

He posted the picture with the message: 'Me and @PReina25 got photobombed by a very odd character!!!'

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers put his players through an intense training session at Harvard University ahead of their second US tour match against Greek side Olympiacos on Sunday.

The Reds lost 1-0 to Roma on Thursday and the players wasted no time in getting ready for their next encounter as they were back training the following day.

Goalkeeper Reina, who spent last season on loan at Napoli, jumped over bars and trained hard despite much speculation surrounding his Anfield future.
