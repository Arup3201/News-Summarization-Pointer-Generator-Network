Nearly 100,000 people are living with HIV in the UK but a quarter of them are unaware that they have the disease, according to the Health Protection Agency.

The latest figures show the number of sufferers has risen from 86,500 to 91,500 between 2009 and 2010.

Of the 6,660 people newly diagnosed with
HIV in 2010, half came forward for testing after a time when treatment 
should ideally have started.

Early treatment boosts chances of living longer with the precursor to Aids. Of the 680 people with HIV who died in 2010, two thirds had been diagnosed late.

Heterosexual men were the most likely to be diagnosed late, at 63 per cent compared with 39 per cent of gay men and 58 per cent of heterosexual women.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks the body's immune system, which we need to fight disease and infection.

The virus specifically attacks CD4 cells. Although the body will try to produce replacements, the number will eventually decline and the immune system will stop working.

Once the person acquires a life-threatening condition, such as pneumonia, they are said to have the last stage of HIV - Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

HIV is spread through bodily fluids - most commonly during unprotected sex.

There is no cure but since the 1990s treatments have been developed to slow down the spread of the disease. This allows people to live with the disease for a very long time.

In 2009, the World Health Organisation estimated there were 33.4m people across the globe living with HIV/AIDS.

In 2010, more than 3,000 gay men were diagnosed with HIV - the highest ever annual figure.

One in 20 gay men are now infected with HIV nationally, rising to one in 11 in London.

Today's data also suggests that a stigma is still attached to the condition, revealing that one in five people visiting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic in 2010 did not accept an HIV test.

The HPA is recommending that, in areas where prevalence of HIV is high, testing should be offered in places where it is not currently the norm.

Testing should be offered to all people signing up with a GP and those admitted to hospital, but only with the patient's permission.

Dr Valerie Delpech, consultant epidemiologist and head of HIV surveillance at the HPA, said: 'HIV is an infection which can nowadays be treated and those diagnosed promptly can expect to experience similar life expectancy as an individual without the infection.

'However, we are very concerned that a large number of people in the UK are unaware of their HIV status and are diagnosed late.

'We want to see increased access to HIV testing routinely offered in clinical settings such as new registrants at GPs and hospital general admissions, in areas of the country where rates of HIV infection are high.

The cost of treating someone with HIV in the UK is estimated to be around £18,000 per year when they are not showing any symptoms.

This is based on the price of care as well as triple-drug antiretroviral therapy.

However, it costs £21,500 to treat patients who are showing symptoms and £41,000 for those with full-blown AIDS.

Patients who have four drugs cost the NHS between £22,775 and £48,000 per year.

The annual cost of providing HIV treatment and care in the UK could be as high as £758m by 2013, according to a study in PLoS One. 

'We are also urging sexual health 
clinics to ensure that HIV testing is offered as part of a universal 
sexual health screen at every new attendance.'

Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: 'The number of people who don't know they have HIV and are diagnosed late is a serious issue.

'Not only does it have a severe impact on health and reduce life expectancy, this largely accounts for the onward transmission of HIV as people aren't taking the necessary steps to avoid passing it on.'

She added: 'People shouldn't be scared of HIV testing, but they should be scared of undiagnosed HIV.

'The advances in HIV treatment have been one of the biggest success stories in the 30 years since the virus first emerged, but too many people test too late and so fail to benefit from these drugs.'

Sir Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'HIV rates in the UK remain dangerously high and to bring them down we all have to take responsibility for our sexual health.

'We can't just rely on partners, or chance, to keep sex safe.'

The HPA has previously predicted that by 2012 there will be 100,000 people living with HIV in the UK.

The study comes just ahead of World Aids Day on December 1.
