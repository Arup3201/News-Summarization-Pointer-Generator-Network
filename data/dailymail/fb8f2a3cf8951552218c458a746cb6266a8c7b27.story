If the mysterious underwater world wasn't already fascinating enough, a diver has captured various fish, crabs, shrimps and coral inhabitants of the Indo-Pacific oceans like never before. 

Underwater photographer Alex Tyrrell 
used a standard DSLR camera in an underwater housing, along with external flash 
strobes to create the surreal effect.

His stunning images show the flora and fauna that live off the coasts of Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines illuminated in bright colours shining like aliens submerged in the deep waters.

London-based underwater photographer Alex Tyrrell took these ultraviolet images of underwater creatures as he travelled across Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. He used external flash strobes to illuminate the underwater flora and fauna and, to create the glowing effect, also filmed the marine life using filters and fluorescent lighting. This image shows a golden mantis shrimp

When diving with a fluorescent mask the diver said he was blown away by the psychedelic colours and immediately wanted to capture the effect on camera.

The 39-year-old, from London, took the photos at Koh Tao, Thailand, the Lembeh Straights, Sulawesi, Indonesia and Anilao Luzon in the Philippines.

Tyrrell said: ‘I enjoy fluorescent photography as it's a bit different from normal underwater photos.

'When diving the same area repetitively and seeing the same creatures, it makes things more interesting.

‘Not too many people have done fluorescent photography well, so it's quite unique and more of a challenge.

‘My camera is a standard DSLR in an underwater housing with external strobes - but you need excitation filters over the strobes to create the fluorescent effect and then Barrier Filters over the lens to strip away the excess blue light - letting the camera record the fluorescence.

‘You also need a fluorescent light to be able to see the fluorescent in the first place and a yellow barrier filter over your mask, which performs the same task as on the camera but for your eyes.’

In one image, Tyrrell captured a hydroid decorator crab clinging to the side of coral. Small decorator 
crabs are often found with stingers on the top of their heads to deter 
predators.

Decorator crabs have also been known to snap off small branches and hook them onto their shells for camouflage and defense.

Another shot shows a freckled frogfish. Frogfish are masters of camouflage and change to match their surroundings.

A
 stalk between their eyes mimics the movement of other smaller fish and 
is used to lure in the frogfish's prey. Their mouths open and expand to 
the width of their bodies to easily devour their prey.

Freckled frogfish, pictured left, are masters of camouflage and change to match their surroundings. A stalk between their eyes, shown in green, mimics the movement of other smaller fish and is used to lure in the frogfish's prey. Their mouths open and expand to the width of their bodies to easily devour their prey. The dusky nebrotha, pictured right, is a member of the Nudibranch family. It is found either on its own, or as part of a pair on coral and rocky reefs, particularly in sand and rubble

In this shot, Tyrell managed to capture the juvenile raggy scorpionfish. Although Tyrrell used red lights to illuminate this fish, adults are best recognised by the tiny light-blue 'eyes', or ocelli cells, scattered across their bodies, as well dark triangles below the eyes. Small juveniles have three distinctive white spots along the back and the species typically lives in coastal reefs, often where the fish can be well camouflaged in areas of algae and seagrass. The spines pictured along the bag are venomous

While the dusky nebrotha, which looks 
like a cut out on a Halloween pumpkin in Tyrrell's photos, is a member 
of the Nudibranch family. It is found either on its own, or as part of a
 pair on coral and rocky reefs, particularly in sand and rubble.

Nudibranch are slow moving creatures that
 swim using either muscular contractions, or by the millions of tiny 
hairs they have on their 'feet'. Nudibranch lay their eggs in a ribbon 
effect on the sand, and each species produces a slightly different 
colour egg.

Among Tyrrell's images is also a Achaeus 
japonicus, known as the orangutan crab. It has relatively long arms 
that are thickly covered with fine hairs that are reddish brown in 
colour, similar to its mammal namesake.

These two images show mushroom coral from a distance, left, and close up, right. This type of coral varies in shape and colour and the species is generally solitary and can often appear bleached or dead. Mushroom corals are able to change sex in response to environmental changes

This image is of the Achaeus japonicus, also known as the orangutan crab. It has relatively long arms, which are thickly covered with fine hairs that are reddish brown in colour, similar to its mammal namesake. These hairs collect debris to help camouflage it further and it hangs from underwater plants

Brain coral, pictured, is the name given to the Faviidae family because its surface and grooves resemble that of the brain. Each head of the coral is formed by a colony of genetically identical polyps that release a hard skeleton of calcium carbonate. Brain corals are found in shallow warm water and use their tentacles to catch food at night. During the day, these tentacles are used for protection

The fimbriated moray, pictured, is a moray eel found in the Indo-Pacific oceans, around reefs and harbours. It is often founds at depths of 147ft (45 metres). It is pale green-yellow in colour and has black spots on its face. The eel can can reach a maximum length of 31 inches (80 cm)

Tyrrell used standard DSLR in an 
underwater housing to take these shots.

He fitted it with external strobes, as well as so-called excitation 
filters over the strobes to create the fluorescent effect.

Additionally, a Barrier filters was placed over the lens to strip away any excess blue light - 
letting the camera record the fluorescence.

Tyrrell said: ‘You
 also need a fluorescent light to be able to see the fluorescent in the 
first place and a yellow barrier filter over your mask, which performs 
the same task as on the camera but for your eyes.’

In another shot, Tyrell managed to capture the juvenile raggy scorpionfish.

Although Tyrrell used red lights to illuminate the fish in his photo, adults are best recognised by the tiny light-blue 'eyes', or ocelli cells, scattered across their bodies, as well as dark triangles below the eyes.

Small juveniles have three distinctive white spots along the back and the species typically lives in coastal reefs, often where the fish can be well camouflaged in areas of algae and seagrass. The spines pictured along the back of the fish are venomous.

A number of corals were also captured by Tyrrell during his travels.

Two images show mushroom coral - one from a distance and a second close up.

This type of coral varies in shape and colour and the species is generally solitary. It can often appear bleached or dead.

Mushroom corals are able to change sex in response to environmental changes.

Elsewhere, brain coral is the name given to the Faviidae family because its surface and grooves resemble that of the brain.

Each head of the coral is formed by a colony of genetically identical polyps that release a hard skeleton of calcium carbonate. Brain corals are found in shallow warm water and use their tentacles to catch food at night. During the day, these tentacles are used for protection.

The torch coral, pictured left, is often known as trumpet coral or pom-pom coral. It is brown or green and has yellow tips on its tentacles. The yellow will sometimes appear to glow, like in Tyrrell's image. The left-hand image shows a spawning magnificent sea anemone sat on torch coral

This mean-looking fish is the yellowface wrasse. When not lit using UV lights, the fish has a grey body, and as its name suggests, a yellow head with pink bands. They live in coral areas along the shoreline, as well as in lagoons

This staghorn coral is also known as green forest because of its similarity with forests above the ground. It is one of several corals of the genus Acropora which is instantly recognisable for having skeleton branches similar to the antlers of a stag
