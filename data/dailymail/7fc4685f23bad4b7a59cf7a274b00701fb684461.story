Arsenal's injury-prone midfielder Abou Diaby played 90 minutes for Arsenal Under 21s as they continued their strong start to the season at Villa Park, thanks to two goals from Chuba Akpom.

Diaby, who has been plagued with injuries over the past four years, was playing his second game for the academy side this season at an empty Villa Park, with just 377 fans in attendance.

The French midfielder was strong and composed in the centre of the park, and showed occasional signs of his undoubted quality by threading sumptuous through-balls between the heart of the Villa defence.

One such pass resulted in a glorious chance for speedy striker  Akpom, but the 18-year-old was unable to round Craig Hill.

By that stage Akpom had already capitalised on some calamitous defending by Villa captain Lewis Kinsella to put Arsenal 1-0 up with a composed finish.

And the striker, who broke the Arsenal record for the 10m sprint last week, doubled his tally late on, showing strength to match his speed as he held off a defender before finishing calmly with a flick of his right boot.

Akpom was one of several Arsenal youngsters who will hope Arsene Wenger was watching their impressive displays on Thursday night.

Hector Bellerin and Isaac Hayden will both expect a chance in the first team this season with Wenger so light on defenders, while Gedion Zelalem once again showed why he is rated so highly at the Emirates.

But it will have been the performance of Diaby that most pleased Wenger. He managed just one Premier League appearance last season, a 15-minute run out in May against Norwich, but if he can keep fit, he can provide the steel in Arsenal's light-weight midfield.
