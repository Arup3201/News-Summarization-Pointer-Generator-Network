Jesse Helt was given 30 days in county jail, placed on supervised probation for 12 months and fined $572 and ordered to pay restitution. In February 2012, he made Polk County's Most Wanted List

The homeless man who accepted Miley Cyrus's VMA gong is on the run from police after breaking probation following a drugs test, it has been claimed, just as he heads home.

Jesse Helt, 22, told MailOnline he is looking forward to seeing his mother, but his homecoming may have a sting - in 2011, a judge in his home state of Oregon issued a warrant for his arrest for repeatedly violating the terms of his probation.

Helt could be arrested on arrival. He was arrested in October 2010 after he tried to break into a flat where he said a man had sold 'bad marijuana' to him.

He was charged with burglary, criminal mischief in the third degree and criminal trespass in the 1st degree. The burglary charge was later dismissed.

On November 23 of the same year, he was given 30 days in county jail, placed on supervised probation for 12 months and fined $572 and ordered to pay restitution.

In mugshots obtained by MailOnline, Helt was booked on probation violations on July 24, 2011 and August 22, 2011.

In February 2012, Helt made the Most Wanted
 List for Polk County. He was listed number two on the list wanted for 
first degree trespass.

Local Judicial Services Specialist Jon Troike told The Sun: 'He still has an outstanding warrant. If he's contacted by the police in Oregon he would be arrested.'

Helt is accused of using marijuana, not providing a urine sample, failing to report to his probation officer, not abiding by the set curfew and not completing community service as mandated.

Last night Helt boarded the 7.50pm Alaska Airlines flight from Los Angeles International Airport that took him back home, the $360 economy ticket paid for by Cyrus

Run-in with the law: In this mugshot dated October 30, 2010, Helt has longer hair

Wanted: In this booking mugshot taken on August 22, 2011, Helt has gotten rid of his longer hair. In that year a judge in his home state of Oregon issued an arrest warrant for repeatedly violating the terms of his probation

He was wearing scruffy black jeans, trainers and a black hoodie and had no luggage with him other than a small carry-on sports bag and a skate-board, which he clutched under his arm.

He left the aeroplane behind other passengers and the were no family or friends to greet him as he walked through the airport.

Instead Helt took a taxi for the 45-mile journey back home to Salem, south of Portland.

Speaking briefly to a MailOnline reporter on the same plane, Helt said that he was ‘glad’ to be finally back home. ‘I miss my mom, I haven’t seen her in three years,’ he added.

And referring to his troubles which began when he was a teenager and led to him living homeless in Los Angeles, he added: ‘I’ve been suffering since I was the age of 13, but I’m glad to be back home.’

Miley Cyrus paid the $360 economy ticket for Jesse Helt to go back to Salem, Oregon

Helt became famous when took to the stage to accept Cyrus's gong and made a speech about homeless young people in California that reduced the singer and many of the audience to tears.

Cyrus reportedly 'auditioned' 'six or seven homeless kids' before choosing Helt to accompany her to the VMAs, according to The Sun. 

Linda Helt, 62, told MailOnline: 'Jesse's had ups and downs like anybody else... he didn't wanna give up and run on home to mommy, but only he knows the reasons, that's for him to say.'

Speaking from her home, Mrs Helt, who has three other sons and a daughter, said: 'He wanted to be in Los Angeles and he had opportunities and he took them, but you know, he's had his ups and downs like anybody else.

'It was his choice, he was always welcome, he could always come back any time. If he needed help, I'd help him, we help one another,’ she added.

Helt grew up in Salem, and he went to Chapman Hill Elementary, Myers Elementary and West Salem High School.

Mrs Helt said that her son moved to Los Angeles a few years ago: 'Because he wanted to make it on his own.'

Stunned by his appearance on the VMAs on Sunday night, Mrs Helt said: 'This will change his life, absolutely. This will turn things around for him and I believe God is the one that is doing it, God is making a difference and Jesse believes that.

'He's a good kid. He was nervous up there on stage, but that's how it is when you have a passion for something like he does. Somebody's helping him and he wants to help someone too.'

Mrs Helt praised Miley for taking action on youth homelessness. 'Miley has taken Jesse to her heart and I’m really glad for Jesse,' she said.

Mrs Helt told The Oregonian said Jesse had called her at 1am  following his appearance at the VMAs, revealing was now flying home after Miley gave him some money.

She told that at one point, Jesse's living situation in LA became so bad he called her and said: 'Mom, I'm living in a bush!' 

Delighted with the attention her son has got, she said: 'It's time for him to have some good luck. He needs to be blessed.'

Just a cursory look online reveals that Jesse had attempted a career as a model, posting pictures on the Model Mayhem website and writing: 'I'm Jesse and I just moved here from Salem, Oregon about a year ago. If your interested in working with me please shoot me an email. I'm not turning down any work right now and would love to work with all kinds of photographers.'

He also posed for photographer Zell Thomas and on his Facebook page describes himself as 'really super nice' and a 'Christian'.

Cyrus, 21, told Ryan Seacrest on his radio show that she chose to this year's VMAs to spread an important message after last year's racy duet with Robin Thicke made headlines across the world, saying: 'I just didn't realise my platform, I didn't realize my power.

'I really realised it after the VMAs [last year] … there's something special and there’s only few people that experience this that no matter what I do, there's no winning or losing, it’s just going to be talked about. Period.'

She added: 'There's going to be talk, so what do I want them to talk about? If I'm going to be given this loud of a voice and this big of an image and this big of a platform and this huge of an opportunity to talk to young people in American right now, what am I really trying to say? Because I don’t think what I was trying to say is what happened the year before.'

And she admitted she kept things so hush hush that she did not tell anyone about her plan - even her friend Katy Perry, whom she was sitting near at the VMAs.

During the show, Miley even pretended that Jesse was her boyfriend, prompting Katy to offer him a drink, as Miley laughed: 'I'm like, "This kid has to give this speech!"

'I’m like, "Katy, please don't get Jesse drunk right now" … I didn't want to tell her because I was scared if someone found out, they’d try to stop me … no one knew. The only person I told, because I knew that he would respect it, was Juicy [J], who was sitting next to me. I couldn't hold it in, I was so excited. I knew that he would respect Jesse and it was cool to have someone there who could keep us both calm.'

Pictured sitting on the side of the stage with a nervous Jesse gave his speech, Cyrus said: 'The courage that he showed to get up there and give that speech.

'I didn’t know how everyone was going to be and seeing his hands shake, it kind of broke me. I wish they wouldn’t have kept putting the camera on me to make it about me crying. I cry when I’m the happiest.'

And as for her Moonman trophy - Cyrus said that Helt gets to keep the statue.

It came as a complete surprise to the millions of viewers and the audience when Helt walked up to collect Miley's trophy.

My Friend's Place Executive Director, Heather Carmichael, told MailOnline that Helt was 'incredibly brave' to stand up and talk at the VMAs.

But she said the charity wasn’t aware that he would be invited to speak at the awards ceremony, saying: 'We did not know about the invitation and we certainly didn’t know what that evening would look like.

‘But I really feel like that Miley has a genuine intention to raise awareness and it's stunning for this issue.

'This issue exists in every community and people are stepping over these young people on the street and don’t want to acknowledge that there's a problem.'
