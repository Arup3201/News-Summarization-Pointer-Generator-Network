Barbara Young, chief executive of the charity Diabetes UK has criticised plans to offer free weight loss surgery

Plans to offer free weight-loss surgery to almost one million adults are nonsense, experts said last night.

In guidelines issued this week, the NHS watchdog NICE said patients who are obese and have type 2 diabetes should be considered for gastric band or bypass operations.

Up to 900,000 patients meet the criteria and it would cost £4.5billion if all wanted bariatric surgery, which includes gastric bands  to constrict the stomach and bypasses that reroute the digestive system.

NICE claims the surgery helps patients with type 2 diabetes lose weight and control the disease.

But experts said the NHS could not afford to pay for all the procedures and patients would do better to diet and get more exercise.

There are also concerns that the obese will give up trying to lose weight because they know they can have free surgery instead.

Baroness Barbara Young, chief executive of the charity Diabetes UK, said: ‘The idea that we’d all, or a significant proportion of us, go and have an operation as part of a programme seems to me to be a sign of failure.

‘Give me the £5,000 you’d spend on an operation and put it into a weight-reduction program and we could win. The more important thing is that people who head for obesity get effective interventions long before they fall into criteria that would justify surgery.’

James Halstead, a bariatric surgeon at Leeds hospital, said: ‘Expecting the UK to have the provision to operate on nearly a million people is an unrealistic proposition. The majority of people, their degree of obesity will be corrected by exercise alone.’

Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, he added: ‘The idea that the NHS could deal with 900,000 extra patients with this alone is nonsensical.’

About 2.6million Britons have type 2 diabetes, and up to a third of adults have prediabetes, a precursor to the illness.

There are also concerns that the obese will give up trying to lose weight because they know they can have free surgery instead

Diabetes costs the NHS £14billion a year, much of which spent treating debilitating complications such as blindness, strokes, kidney failure and amputations. NICE says evidence shows bariatric surgery helps patients control their diabetes and in some cases effectively cures them.

Gastric bands cost at least £5,000 and gastric bypasses cost £9,500 or more. Last year 8,024 operations were carried out.

Both reduce the size of the stomach, which causes patients to lose their appetite. At the moment, the NHS only offers them to morbidly obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or more – equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman of 20 stone. BMI is based on height and weight. The obese are those with a score higher than 30.

The new guidelines propose offering surgery to anyone with type 2 diabetes and a BMI of at least 30 – equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman weighing 15st 10lb.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘A considerable number of people who have had diabetes for some time and have been receiving medication will see a way out and they’ll say, “That’s for me”. But the Health Service is going to say, “No, we’re out of money, you can’t have it”, and that’s going to create friction.’

Professor Mark Baker, of NICE, said: ‘The mainstay of weight reduction continues to be diet and exercise. But some people, whose lives are threatened by diabetes, can be transformed if they are offered surgery earlier than current guidance would allow.’
