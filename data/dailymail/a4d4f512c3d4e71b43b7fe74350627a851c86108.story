The king of the Maoris has vented his anger over a diplomatic row that saw him pull out of a meeting with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

King Tuheitia said he was ‘not some carnival act to be rolled out at the beck and call of anyone’ after officials offered him  a supposedly paltry 90-minute meeting with the royal couple during their visit to New Zealand next month.

The king blamed ‘faceless bureaucrats’ for ‘a grave error of judgment’, and said the full reasons for his refusal were ‘conveyed to the royal couple in a personal letter . . . several weeks ago’.

The furore risks overshadowing William and Kate’s tour of the country, which begins in Wellington on April 7.

Not only was the meeting considered to be hugely important as a mark of respect to the indigenous community, but William and Kate would have been following in the footsteps of the Queen and Prince Philip, who visited King Tuheitia’s mother, Dame Te Atairangikaahu, in 1953.

The Queen visited her again in 1995 and shortly
 before she died in 2006 and was succeeded by her son, Prince Charles 
wrote to the queen to congratulate her on the 40th anniversary of her 
coronation, saying: ‘Our two families have enjoyed a wonderful 
friendship.

‘The 40 years of
 the leadership, courage and stability you have so far given to the 
people of Aotearoa New Zealand and indeed to the wider world... is an 
immeasurable treasure.’

The
 Maori people had hoped that the Duke and Duchess would visit their 
ruler at his home at Turangawaewae Marae - his people’s ‘sacred’ place -
 during a visit to the country’s North Island.

Locals had been 
planning the couple’s itinerary for weeks, saying they were looking 
forward to welcoming the young royals to the ‘heart of the kingitanga’, 
the Maori monarchy.

But on Tuesday the Mail revealed that King Tuheitia was so insulted by the suggestion the couple could offer only 90 minutes out of their schedule, he pulled out of the visit completely.

According to sources, the long list of demands around the visit and 
tight timeframe would have broken proper protocol on the marae.

In a statement yesterday his office said: ‘The King was never asked anything, he was simply told.

‘The
 government-appointed committee overseeing the visit never met with any 
officials from this office and when we did seek to contact them, they 
were not willing to be negotiable or flexible in their approaches to the
 king.

‘A senior rangatira [official] noted that the king and the 
kiingitanga [the royal line] are not some carnival act to be rolled out 
at the beck and call of anyone, and nor should we be prepared to 
compromise our tikanga [customs] to fit into a pre-determined schedule.’

History: The Royal couple would have followed in the footsteps of the Queen, who met the Maori king's mother Dame Te Atairangikaahu in 1953 and again in 1995, when she wore traditional dress (left)

It added: ‘The king wanted to give his best to this couple to reflect their status, he was being prevented from doing that.’

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key described the king’s decision as ‘a shame’. He said the ‘generous’ slot offered was longer than most engagements the couple had in the country.

A Kensington Palace spokesman also stressed there would be ‘numerous chances’ to meet members of the Maori community at the many traditional welcomes from different tribes the couple will receive.

They said: ‘The programme for the visit, including the Maori elements, has been signed off by the New Zealand Government.

‘Many elements were considered and we have worked with the New Zealand Government to include several appropriate events on the visit to recognise the significant of Maori culture.

'These include a substantial Powhiri, or ceremonial welcome, in Wellington, together with Maori engagements in Dunedin, Christchurch and elsewhere.’

The Duke and Duchess - accompanied by their son, Prince George - will arrive in New Zealand on April 7 and visit Wellington, Blenheim, Auckland, Hamilton, Cambridge, Dunedin, Queenstown and Christchurch before leaving for Australia on April 16.
