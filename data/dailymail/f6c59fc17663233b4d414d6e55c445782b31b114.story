The devastated relatives of a family killed in a car crash have paid tribute to their loved ones, as an 18-month-old baby - the sole survivor of the accident - remains in hospital.

John Kehoe, 72, his wife Margaret, 65, their son-in-law Martyn Pugh, 47, and 28-year-old Alison Hind all died in the three-vehicle collision in West Wales last week.

Baby Holly Hind was the only survivor. She is currently being treated at Cardiff’s University Hospital Wales, where she is said to be in a stable condition, with her father at her bedside.

Investigations into what caused the crash on the A44 near Llangurig are continuing.

Survivor: Holly Hind, 18 months, (left) was the sole survivor when her great-uncle Martyn Pugh's car was in a pile-up with a fuel tanker and a van, killing her 28-year-old mother, Alison (right), Mr Pugh, 47, and his partner’s elderly parents, John and Margaret Kehoe

All four of those killed had been travelling in a Ford Focus. The other vehicles involved in the crash were a tanker and a van.

The driver of the van escaped uninjured as did the lorry driver.

But the four adults in the Ford were killed. Holly, who was strapped into a child seat, was airlifted to hospital in Cardiff.

Her 
father, 36-year-old mechanic Steve Hughes, is at her bedside. The 
incident led to a 21-mile stretch of the road being closed for 12 hours.

The family of Holly’s mother, Ms Hind, said they were utterly heartbroken.

John Kehoe, 72, his wife Margaret, 65, died in the crash last week. Relatives have paid tribute to a 'devoted couple'

Their son-in-law Martyn Pugh, 47, was also killed. The family of Mr Pugh, who was Ms Hind's brother-in-law, said he would be 'deeply missed by his large circle of family and friends'

Scene: The 'dangerous' A44 in Powys was closed for 12 hours after the tragic crash

'She was a lovely, kind and caring person,' they said in a statement.

'She was a great mother, partner, daughter and friend to all who knew her.

'Alison
 doted on her two children Ethan and Holly. She was dedicated to her 
family and friends, always putting other people before herself and an 
extremely hard worker.

'She will be missed by all her family and friends enormously, and will never be forgotten.'

The
 family of Mr Pugh, who was Ms Hind’s brother-in-law, said he would be 'deeply missed by his large circle of family and friends'.

Tragedy: 18-month-old Holly Hind was rescued from the vehicle's wreckage and flown to hospital by air ambulance after a collision involving a fuel tanker and a van in Wales

Holly was flown south to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and is today in a serious condition in hospital but is expected to survive. Her father is with her

They said: 'Martin was a fun-loving, caring and considerate person. He was a devoted family man and a dedicated partner to Lynn and dad to his two children, Matthew and Nicole.

'For the last 11 years he has cared for his partner Lynn but previously worked at Laura Ashley’s. He enjoyed fishing and spent most of his time caring for wider family members.'

And the family of John and Margaret Kehoe said they would always remember the 'devoted' couple.

'Mum and Dad were devoted to each other and their family. Their passing is a great loss to us all and our pain has been increased so much by having them both taken from us at the same time and in such tragic circumstances.

'Although we mourn their deaths, we take comfort from the warmth and love of the family they left behind.

'We will forever carry them in our hearts and thoughts, and will always be able to smile when remembering the joy and happiness they gave to all those, whose lives they touched.'

It is believed the family were driving home following a trip to the seaside at Aberystwyth on June 17.
