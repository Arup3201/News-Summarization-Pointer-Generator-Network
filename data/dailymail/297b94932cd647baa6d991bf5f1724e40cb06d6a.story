Doctors have been working tirelessly over the past two weeks to keep Sharon Budd alive after a football-sized rock tossed from an overpassed shattered her skull.

Screws, bolts and plates now hold together the face of the 52-year-old seventh-grade teacher from Uniontown, Ohio, who was left with a large, gaping wound across her forehead and broken bones when she was struck on July 10 in Pennsylvania.

That is when police say four teenagers — three now charged as adults, one as a juvenile — decided to throw rocks from an Interstate 80 overpass as Budd, her husband and a daughter happened to be passing through, on their way to see a show in New York.

That first night, surgeons at Geisinger Medical Center did what they could to clean out pieces of her skull that were jutting into her brain. They also removed parts of her intact skull to allow for the swelling they knew would soon follow.

‘We had to make sure that she was going to survive, that was our immediate goal for the first 72 hours,’" Dr. Atom Sarkar, her neurosurgeon, said Monday.

The damage destroyed barriers the skull forms that make separate compartments needed to avoid infection of the brain from the nose and mouth.

Doctors also had to use a piece of her skull to fabricate a bridge between her eyes.

Kaylee Budd, 19, one of the Budds' four children, was driving just before midnight July 10 when the rock crashed through the front windshield of their Nissan Rogue.

The college sophomore stopped and turned on the light to see her 52-year-old mother, a breast cancer survivor, had suffered horrifying injuries.

From some 20 feet above, the rock apparently struck Sharon Budd directly on the forehead.

It hit like an explosion, said Randy Budd, who described the injuries as so gruesome that he wasn't sure what he was seeing — blood and possibly brain matter amid shattered glass.

Waiting for help, Kaylee and Randy held Sharon's hands, prayed, did what they could to reassure her and tried to prevent her from rubbing her head wound.

Altered: Doctors have been forced to remove the right frontal lobe of Sharon Budd's brain, which helps determine personality

Randy Budd said his wife had just 
finished speaking with their eldest son, Lucas, before the vehicle was 
struck by the rock.

The
 28-year-old was scheduled to leave for Afghanistan with the Ohio 
National Guard for a one-year deployment but his departure has
 been delayed as his mother fights for her life.

After hanging up the phone, she asked him to send her a photo from his station in Fort Bliss, Texas, which he did.

'He wrote back, "I really miss you mom",' Randy Budd said.

At
 the hospital, a physician braced Randy Budd for the worst, saying she 
was perilously close to death and advising him to call loved ones.

‘Two
 gentlemen came up and said: 2We're going to do an emergency surgery. 
Give her a chance to live.” I just signed. Some eye doctors came in and 
basically said the same thing. I signed,’ Randy Budd said.

It took her about a week to recuperate enough for ear, nose and throat surgeons to perform more comprehensive work on her face.

It
 was during that follow-up surgery last Thursday that doctors realized 
damage to the right frontal lobe of her brain and some parts of the left
 were likely to continue giving her problems and needed to be removed 
during a 13-hour operation.

The
 frontal lobe helps determine your personality, a particularly bitter 
fate for Sharon, a woman with a wide network of friends and a devotion 
to her career as a language arts teacher.

‘That
 part of the brain actually affects your social interactivity, how she 
is as a person, if she's warm and compassionate, or bubbly and 
ebullient, or just quiet and reserved,’ Sarkar said. ‘That doesn't mean 
that she can't be the person she was.’

Her
 arms and legs appear to be moving appropriately, but doctors don't know
 how her dexterity and fine motor control will be affected. It is likely
 she has permanently lost the use of her right eye.

A
 tube in her brain was removed Monday, and although she is somewhat 
sedated, she has been able to follow her doctors' commands, mostly 
shaking her head or wiggling her fingers and toes, Randy Budd said 
Tuesday.

Doctors hope to perform additional skull reconstruction, and at some point remove the hardware.

The
 scar from the rock runs from her right ear across her forehead; the one
 from the procedure to remove portions of her skull goes across the top 
of her head, from ear to ear.

Now they wait to see how she progresses.

‘We can say she's not going to die,’ Sarkar said, ‘but there's a very far gulf between not dying and being the person you were.’

Fears: Randy said when he saw her injuries, 'it was the most gruesome thing that you could ever imagine'

Three Pennsylvania teenagers have now been charged as adults in the near-fatal highway rock-throwing incident.

Milton resident Tyler Gregory Porter, 17, appeared in court Monday on charges including aggravated assault and conspiracy. Court records indicate he told police another boy threw the rock that hit Budd's car.

Two other teens, including 18-year-old Brett Lahr and 17-year-old Dylan Lahr, were previously arrested on those counts.

A fourth juvenile identified only by his initials KLN was also apprehended. 

The group face felony charges of aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, and counts of propulsion of missiles into an occupied vehicle or onto roadway, possessing of instruments of crime and recklessly endangering another person, the Daily Item reported.

KLM told state police that they had been driving in his Mitsubishi Eclipse when they stopped on the overpass to Interstate 80, according to the criminal complaint, the Daily Item reported.

Dylan Lahr and Porter got out and threw rocks at and struck passing vehicles, KLM told troopers. He said he saw a vehicle slow down but that they fled to the Lahrs' house.

They then got into the Lahr family's gold Honda Accord and drove past the scene to see what was happening and when they saw a police car, they returned to the home.

KLM and Brett Lahr headed back to the scene again and saw several more police cruisers before returning to the Lahrs' house.

Police checked the license plate of the Honda, which was registered to the Lahr family, and went to their home in New Columbia.

When questioned by police, Tyler Porter said he threw one rock onto I-80 but did not strike a vehicle whereas Dylan Lahr threw at least two rocks and one of them struck a car.

Brett Lahr, the older brother, remained in Union County Prison in lieu of $50,000 bail, while Dylan Lahr was released on supervised bail.

Sharon Budd's family has set up a GoFundMe page to help with her medical costs, which so far has collected more than $18,000 in donations. Another online fundraiser has been launched on YouCaring.com, where as of Tuesday afternoon supporters have surpassed the $25,000 goal.
