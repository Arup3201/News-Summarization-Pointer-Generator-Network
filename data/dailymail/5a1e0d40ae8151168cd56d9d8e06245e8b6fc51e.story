The biggest investment in Britain’s railways since the Victorian era and the age of steam is to be announced by the Government next week in a bid to get the nation’s struggling economy back on track.

Up to £10billion is expected to be spent boosting the railways and even reversing some of the infamous ‘Dr Beeching’ cuts imposed by the efficiency expert during the 1960s which saw vast swathes of the rail network and stations dismembered.

But fares are set to rise by 3 per cent above the RPI rate of inflation over the next two years.

Passengers
paying for their tickets are on course to pay 75 per cent of £5billion a
year total cost of running the railways by 2014 – up from 50 per cent.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening is set to announce the funding for a range of schemes including electrification and the opening of new stations designed to improve train services for millions of passengers while pumping much needed cash into a flat-lining economy.

One idea set to be resurrected is a ‘Varsity line’ linking the university towns of Oxford and Cambridge.

Whitehall sources said:’ It is on track to be the biggest investment in the railways since the Victorian era.’

However, with rail users facing a new round of inflation-busting fares – as taxpayer subsidies in the railways reduce – many passengers will be wondering if they can afford to use the trains.

Full details are to be released early next week but the total package is estimated by the rail industry insiders to cost between £9billion and £10billion. 

Projects are expected to include new rail electrification, including of the Midland Main Line from London to the East Midlands and Sheffield, and local lines in the Welsh Valleys.

It means rail journey times between London and the north of England will be cut.

It is predicted that the journey time between London and Sheffield could be cut from about two hours and 10 minutes to two hours.

Trips between Liverpool and Manchester could also be up to 10 minutes faster.

Electrification between Manchester and Leeds is likely to be extended.

Projects around Manchester in what is termed ‘The Northern Hub’ are set to get the green light to boost capacity to allow more and faster trains across the North of England.

Also envisaged are upgrades to the main East Coast Line from London to Leeds and Newcastle

Investments in rail freight to ports such as Southampton and Felixstowe are likely in a bid to get more lorries off the road.

There will also be some new and reopened lines. Ministers want a new line into Heathrow from the west and are expected to confirm the reopening of the East-West link from Oxford and Aylesbury to Milton Keynes.

Funds for local councils to bid for new lines and stations – or re-open old disused ones – are also expected, as well as for redeveloping and upgrading stations, improving accessibility, and  carrying out smaller scale upgrades such as re-instating tracks and platforms removed in the past.

There will also be funds to finish projects already underway such as Crossrail and Thameslink in London and electrification of the lines from London to Bristol and Cardiff, and from Manchester to Liverpool, Blackpool and Leeds.

The details will be released in a dossier called the High Level Output Specification (HLOS) which is expected to be published on Monday, covering allowed expenditure on the railways for the five years from 2014-19.

Ministers will also continue with their support for the controversial High Speed rail link to the Midlands and the North, set to begin from 2026.

Some of £10billion extra investment will be borrowed by Network Rail, some will be direct Government funding, and some will be from the letting of rail franchises, as well as from cost saving efficiencies.

The Campaign for Better Transport said: ‘Whilst we welcome more investment in rail, massive fares increases shouldn’t be used to pay for it.

‘Rail use is booming, and has continued to grow through the recession, for both passengers and freight. The number of people using trains is now at levels not seen since the 1920s, on a smaller network.

‘Some rural branch lines that were proposed for closure years ago are now seeing record growth and use overcrowded trains. ‘

A spokesman added: ‘The Government sees infrastructure as a way of boosting the economy and creating growth, and the railways are part of this. Consequently, we expect significant investment.

‘But while we welcome more investment in rail, massive fares increases shouldn’t be used to pay for it. ‘
