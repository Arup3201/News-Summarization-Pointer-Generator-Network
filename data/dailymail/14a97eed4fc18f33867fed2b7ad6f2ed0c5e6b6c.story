England Women will face France, Colombia and Mexico in the group stage at next year's World Cup in Canada.

Manager Mark Sampson's side won all 10 of their qualifying matches and conceded just once in the process, raising expectations that were checked by last month's 3-0 defeat to European champions Germany at Wembley.

England have reached the quarter-finals in each of their three previous World Cup appearances, and have ambitions of improving on those showings.

They were placed in Group F in a draw conducted at the Canadian Museum of History in Ottawa, with seeds France, ranked fourth in the FIFA rankings, the toughest early test for Sampson's side.

From the six groups, 16 teams will advance to the knock-out stage.

The tournament runs from June 6 to July 5.

England's opener will be against France in Moncton, New Brunswick, on June 9. The teams are also due to play each other in a friendly in England on April 9, at a venue still to be announced.

England, ranked seventh by FIFA, will then face Mexico, also in Moncton, on June 13, before tackling Colombia at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal four days later.

Controversy has been sparked by FIFA allowing the tournament to be played on artificial turf, with a group of over 50 players, including United States star forward Abby Wambach, filing a legal complaint against the decision, citing gender discrimination.

They have challenged the move under Ontario's Human Rights Code, but on the eve of the draw FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke called it "a nonsense" and "completely crazy" to suggest discrimination was an accusation that could be levelled at the world governing body.

Goal-line technology will be implemented and tournament prize money rises to 15 million US dollars (£9.6million) - a 50 per cent rise from the 2011 tournament.

The prize pot for the 2014 men's World Cup was 576 million US dollars (£370million).

Tournament hosts Canada, drawn in Group A, will face China on the tournament's opening day in Edmonton, before playing New Zealand and Holland.

Defending champions Japan have Switzerland, Cameroon and Ecuador to negotiate in Group C.
