Ronald Koeman has revealed he wants to make Ryan Bertrand's loan deal at the club permanent.

The 25-year-old is currently on his seventh loan spell from parent club Chelsea, but appears to have finally found his rhythm and has been impressing Southampton's manager. 

Bertrand was brought in as a replacement for Luke Shaw, who moved to Manchester United in the summer for £31.5million. But while Shaw has struggled to make an impact at his new club, Bertrand is playing arguably the best football of his career.

2006: Bournemouth

2007-08: Oldham Athletic

2008-09: Norwich City

2009-10: Reading

2010-11: Nottingham Forest

2014: Aston Villa

2014-15: Southampton 

When asked whether he was interested in signing Bertrand on a permanent basis, Koeman told the Southern Daily Echo: 'If we have the money, yes. If its up to me, yes.

'Maybe it's too early to talk about that, but I am very happy until now with the performance of Ryan.'

Bertrand won both the Champions League and Europa League with Chelsea, but his career stagnated in the years that followed. Now, Koeman believes regular football is helping him to develop once more.

He said: 'Ryan got the opportunity (at Southampton) to play every weekend what he missed in Chelsea, he’s still a young player  and the best way to develop yourself is playing every weekend.'
