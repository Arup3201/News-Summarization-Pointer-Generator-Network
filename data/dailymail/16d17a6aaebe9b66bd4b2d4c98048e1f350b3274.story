Michael Jamieson's silver medal was a rare highlight for British Swimming at London 2012.

At the Commonwealth Games he will go for gold for Scotland on the opening evening, and might need to break the world record to get it.

Despite receiving £25m in funding during the four-year build up to the Games, Team GB returned a paltry three medals.

The other two were bronze, both won by Becky Adlington. They fell two medals short of their pre-games target and had their funding slashed by 15% ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics.

But Steve Parry, who won one Olympic and three Commonwealth medals during his career, claims British swimmers are about to bounce back in Glasgow.

‘At the Olympics we were always there or thereabouts, but we didn’t get medals and obviously that looked like the British swimmers had underperformed,’ said Parry, ‘But there are over 200 countries that compete at the Olympics — it is incredibly competitive and Britain have never managed to get more than three medals since the mid-80s. So it wasn’t a disastrous Games for us.

‘But Glasgow is a massive opportunity to put that right. It’s still on home soil and that will be a benefit. There will be a great deal of energy in there and it’s up to the athletes to feed off that and fulfil their potential.’

Jamieson will lead the charge in the 200m breaststroke. His Olympic final, where he came second behind Hungary’s Daniel Gyurta, was screened live at Parkhead before his beloved Celtic’s European clash with HJK Helsinki that same night.

He will take centre stage on Thursday evening when the action gets underway.

Swimming legend Mark Foster says Jamieson will be aiming for a world record.

‘He’s got the body to do it, he’s got the ability to do it, he’s got the mind to do it,’ Foster said, with Jamieson’s PB standing at 2:07.43mins — just 0.42seconds outside the world record. ‘There’s no reason why he can’t do it.

Jamieson might have to break the world record to win gold, such is the quality of the field. Australian Christian Sprenger, the Olympic silver medallist in the 100m, will be a threat as will the Scot’s training partner, Englishman Andrew Willis.

If Jamieson can win gold, it could the pave the way for further glory in the years to come, with the Rio Olympics just two years down the line.

Given that Adlington, now retired, won over half of Team GB’s swimming medals at the last two Olympics, British Swimming could struggle in Brazil.

But Adlington thinks it’s back on the right track.

‘I don’t see the amount of medals in Rio being hugely different because we have never won more than three, it’s predicting the colour that’s hard,’ said Adlington, who was speaking at an Everyone Active, Fit For Sport and Legacy Games Day.

‘Michael Jamieson is likely to still be up there and there are good youngsters coming through. To have something like the Commonwealth Games is such an amazing stepping stone so hopefully there’ll be a roll-on effect. We’re definitely in a better place than we have been in a long time.

‘My old coach Bill Furniss is now Head Coach and Chris Spice is Performance Director. We should have had them for the last ten years. We’ve been attempting to replicate America and Australia, now we’ve got our own plan.

‘Let’s not follow, let’s lead.’
