A farmer has been ordered to tear down a castle he secretly built and hid beneath haystacks and tarpaulin after losing a six year planning battle.

Robert Fidler built the impressive castle - complete with ramparts and cannon - on his land in Redhill, Surrey, in 2001 but kept it hidden under the 40ft-high stack of hay bales until 2006.

The 63-year-old thought he would be immune from planning rules as his family had been living there for more than four years and nobody had objected to it.

A farmer has been ordered to tear down a castle he secretly built behind haystack after losing a six year planning battle

Robert Fidler built the impressive castle - Honeycrock Farmhouse - on his land in Redhill, Surrey, in 2001 but kept it hidden under a 40ft-high stack of hay bales and tarpaulin until 2006

Guidelines state that anything built without planning permission, but remaining unchallenged for four years or more, could not be ‘enforced against’ by planners.

But Reigate & Banstead Borough Council refused to grant retrospective planning permission and he was ordered to demolish the four-bed property - Honeycrock Farmhouse - in 2007.

For the past six years Mr Fidler and wife Laura has been through the appeals system as they fought to keep their home.

They have been through hearings at the Planning Inspectorate and the High Court and many appeals, but were finally ordered to knock down the castle after a two-day hearing of the Planning Inspectorate, a government agency responsible for ruling on planning appeals.

The report, written by inspector Sara Morgan and published last week, said Mr Fidler had kept his home ‘concealed’ behind a shield of straw bales’ and that he had ‘set out deliberately to deceive’ the council by using the four-year rule.

She wrote: 'His actions in constructing the dwelling house behind a wall of straw bales, and then living in the building for over four years before the bales were removed, was intended to conceal the building and its use from the council’s knowledge and thus prevent any enforcement action being taken before it was too late.'

Councillor Mike Miller, Reigate & Banstead Council’s member for planning and development, said last week: 'We are pleased with the outcome of the appeal and the planning inspector’s decision.

'It supports our argument that the building is unlawful and that our earlier enforcement notices are valid.

'Had this appeal been allowed, it would have set an unacceptable precedent for development in the green belt.

Mr Fidler was relying on guidelines which stated that anything built without planning permission, but remaining unchallenged for four years or more, could not be 'enforced against' by planners

'The council has a duty to protect the green belt from unlawful development and the character of the borough - that is what our residents want and expect of us.'

Speaking at a previous appeal hearing at the High Court in 2010 Deputy High Court Judge Sir Thayne Forbes said it was ‘clear’ the castle had been built in ‘clandestine fashion’.

He told the court: 'Mr Fidler made it quite clear that the construction of his house was undertaken in a clandestine fashion, using a shield of straw bales around it and tarpaulins or plastic sheeting over the top in order to hide its presence during construction.

'He stated that he knew he had to deceive the council of its existence until a period of four years from substantial completion and occupation had occurred as they would not grant planning permission for its construction.

Speaking previously, Mr Fidler said he would ‘never demolish his home’ and that he would go to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary, adding: 'This house will never be knocked down. This is a beautiful house that has been lovingly created. I will do whatever it takes to keep it.'

Mr Fidler was ordered to pay the council’s costs for the appeal.

A spokesman for Reigate & Banstead Borough Council said today that Mr Fidler has six weeks to appeal to the High Court against the latest decision - ordering him to knock down his castle.

She said that Mr Fidler also has two new planning applications in place - one for building a new barn and another for retrospective planning permission to keep the castle for ‘agricultural use’.

She added: 'Mr Fidler has the right to challenge the Planning Inspector’s decision and has six weeks to appeal to the High Court if he wishes to do so.'

'These latest appeals are different to the applications that were the subject of his earlier High Court appeal - these were against our refusal of three further applications for Certificates of Lawfulness (to retain the house and patio) submitted between 2009 and 2011.

'Mr Fidler also has two new planning applications in with the council which are awaiting determination - one for a small open sided barn structure and the other for retrospective permission to retain the house on grounds of an agricultural need case.'

'We cannot comment any further at this stage as we cannot prejudice the determination of the planning applications or our legal position.'
