Naked Rambler Stephen Gough - who has spent years in solitary confinement in a Scottish jail - was branded arrogant and self-indulgent by a sheriff after refusing to get dressed and go home to England.

Gough, from Hampshire, was brought into a draughty courtroom naked but for a pair of handcuffs today to be quizzed on why he had refused social work and psychiatric help.

The ex-marine was jailed for five months at Kirkcaldy Sheriff's Court, Fife, for committing a breach of the peace.

He was found guilty of the offence last month after strolling naked near a swing park 
where children were playing in Dunfermline, also in Fife, and refusing to 
put on clothes.

Sentence had been deferred for social workers to assess 
whether he needed psychiatric intervention.

His arrest in July came just three days after he had been freed from 
prison in Perth, 30 miles to the north, after spending six years in 
solitary for previous offences involving nakedness.

Gough, 53, who insists he is not a naturist and claims his naked rambles
are 'a protest,' was initially removed from the dock after only five 
minutes when he refused to sit down so his privates were hidden by the 
wooden dock.

He said: 'I just want to be treated like anybody else.'

After he was brought back in, and agreed to sit, the court heard he had 
refused to meet social workers and so no assessment was available.

Prosecutor Brian Robertson said the Crown was prepared to help him go back to England if he co-operated.

Mr Robertson said: 'The authorities are prepared to facilitate his 
return home if his behaviour doesn’t cause alarm to the public.'

Sheriff James Williamson told Gough, who has refused legal 
representation, said that he was concerned that he had not met or co-operated
with social workers drawing up the background report ordered.

The sheriff said: 'Will you meet with them and assist them?'

When Gough responded, 'No, not really', Sheriff Williamson said he had been left with no choice but to jail him for five months.

The sentence was backdated until July 20th, the date of his arrest, 
meaning Gough will be freed again before Christmas.

If he wins 50 
percent time off for good behaviour - unlikely unless he drops his 
protest - he could be out in three weeks.

He is likely to serve his sentence in Edinburgh’s tough Saughton Prison.

Sheriff Williamson told Gough he realised his motives for refusing to 
get dressed were not 'sinister,' but slammed him for his refusal to 
co-operate with the preparation of a social background report.

He said: 'I had hoped it [the report] would assist me in dealing with 
you without sending you back to prison - but you leave me no choice.

'The police officers who arrested you told you that if you carried on 
your journey you would pass a playground occupied by children.

'You were given three options - one, change direction, two, cover your 
private parts, or three, enter a police van which would take you around 
the playpark and release you on your way at the other side.

'Despite that, you refused, which showed disregard for other members of 
the public, in particular children who have the right not to see naked 
men.

'It shows arrogance.

'That self-indulgence carries on today.

'I have no other alternative option but to impose a custodial sentence.'

Gough, of Chamberlain Road, Eastleigh, Hampshire, now has 18 convictions for nakedness.

He first achieved notoriety during a naked walk from Land’s End to John O’Groats in 2003.

He went on to be repeatedly arrested and jailed for walking naked, and refusing to get dressed.

He had tasted only minutes of freedom - usually being re-arrested at the
prison gates for being naked - until his release from on July 17th.

Earlier this month Gough’s former partner Alison Ward, the mother to his
two children, Kiana, 16 and Yarin, 14, said she could not comprehend why he had given up family life, and knowing his children, simply to 
walk around naked.

She said: 'I don’t think Steve is a bad person, but he’s made bad decisions.

'I feel very sad for him, for what he’s given up.

'He lost his 
relationship with me. He has two beautiful children who are a real joy, 
but he hasn’t been a father to them.

'The price he’s paid for his determination to go naked is too high.

'When I told Steve, ‘You can’t see the kids if you’re going to go naked’, he said, ‘Right, I won’t see them.

'He chose his cause over his children and he’s continued to do so.'

A Crown Office spokesman said: 'The actions of the accused made his arrest and prosecution necessary.

'Mr Gough intentionally caused shock and alarm to children and their parents.

'The evidence in this case clearly established that despite repeated police requests not to do so, he was determined to deliberately walk naked past a busy children's play-park in Fife.

'He knew that in doing so he would provoke anger and upset.

The sheriff held that his conduct constituted the crime of breach of the peace.'

The spokesman said the police had gone to great lengths to to preven further offences being committed by Mr Gough.

'For example,' he said, 'on release from HMP Edinburgh in 2007, police officers offered to take Gough to an address of his choosing in Yorkshire.

'Although he originally agreed to go with them, he changed his mind and attempted to walk from the prison along the A71 when he was arrested again.

'The authorities are prepared to facilitate his return home providing his behaviour does not, as in the current case, cause public alarm and necessitate arrest to protect the public.
