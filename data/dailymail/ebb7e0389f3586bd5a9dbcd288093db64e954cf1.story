Florida is on alert as a toxic red tide, the biggest since 2005, is threatening holidaymakers as it moves down the coast.

The red tide, with the scientific name of Karenia brevis, is caused by microscopic algae blooms that explode in numbers when the conditions are right.

Usually a phenomenon that occurs in late summer or early autumn, the tide can produce harmful chemicals and cause respiratory problems.

If the red tide gets within a mile of the beach, the crashing waves could release the toxins into the Florida air

Don Anderson, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, told NBC News: 'These kinds of blooms damage wildlife, people, tourism, everything. It can kill fish by the millions.'

The red tide can be also be damaging to people, especially those suffering from chronic asthma, bronchitis, or emphysema.

Even those who don't suffer from respiratory conditions can feel the red tide's effects.

Humans near the bloom may experience coughing, sneezing, itchy skin and teary eyes.

'When the wind blows, you can't really breathe,' said Anderson, who has experienced it first-hand.

'You start wheezing and coughing and you have to wear a surgical mask or move inland.'

The microorganism can only be seen with a microscope.

While it is always present in the Gulf of Mexico in negligible amounts, large blooms turn the sea a reddish brown color.

The current bloom is around 20 miles off the coast of Florida, too far away to affect beachgoers, at least for the meantime.

While the red tide appears almost every year, officials have not seen one this size since 2005. It is currently thought to be stretching 90 miles long, 60 miles wide and at least 100 feet down.

So far, the animal death count in the sea is moderate. Around 1,000 fish and some crabs and octopi have been killed, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, but that could change if it moves closer to shore.

Holidaymakers could be in danger if the red tide drifts to within a mile of the beaches. Once it’s that close, the crashing waves can release the toxins into the air.

While humans risk a few nights resting in bed, the powerful toxins are much more harmful in other animals and can kill fish, shellfish, mammals and birds. 

In 2013, a smaller red tide bloomed closer to the Florida shore, resulting in the deaths of 276 of the state’s 5,000 manatees.

The endangered mammals eat the toxic algae when it settles on the sea grass that they feed on.

In 2004, around 100 dolphins were found dead in the same area. When scientists examined their stomachs, they found fish contaminated by the algae.

Red tides are a natural phenomenon that happen almost every year and are very unpredictable. There is no real way to stop them. 

Two underwater robots from Mote Marine Laboratory and the University of South Florida have been  monitoring the red tide in Florida and surrounding oceans since they were deployed on 1 August.

The results from the robots are helping to shape short-term bloom forecasts.
