For hardened criminals that have spent a lifetime trying to evade the police, politely offering to get The Bill might not come naturally.

But that's exactly what inmates from HMP Prescoed and HMP Cardiff will soon be doing when they swap their overalls for aprons and sharp suits to work at a new restaurant inside the high security Cardiff jail.

You might expect an eatery run by prisoners to serve up stodgy dishes, but the aptly named Clink Cymru restaurant will provide high quality food in a fine-dining environment.

A total of 30 cateogry D prisoners will be offered jobs as chefs, waiters and cleaners at the new restaurant which can serve up to 96 people at any one time.

The diner will be the second of its kind to be launched in the UK following the opening of The Clink at HMP High Down in Surrey three years ago.

Employees at the new restaurant in Cardiff will all be criminals who are all close to their release date with  no drug addiction or anger management issues.

Alberto Crisci - formerly a chef at Mirabelle in London's Mayfair, which was once owned by Marco Pierre White, cooked up the concept and is the man behind the Wales venture.

Talking about why he decided to embark on the new scheme Crisci, who will be assisted by head chef Mike Arnopp, said he wanted to help prisoners stand on their own two feet again after their release.

He said: 'Once the prisoners come to prison they've committed a crime.

'If it was your son would you prefer that he was banged up, beaten, treated with disrespect, treated inhumanely?

'As far as I'm concerned he's in 
prison, he's lost his freedom and he has to do what he's told 24 hours a
 day and that's his punishment.

'If
 he has no qualifications, if he has no prospects, when he is released 
if they have no job, no family, no accommodation, no qualifications the 
likelihood is they are going to come back. We're trying to break that 
cycle.

'It's a very 
short-term view to say get them in, bang them up, treat them bad, they 
won't come back. If they have no other choice, no other means of finding
 a job, of supporting themselves, the chances are they will come back.'

Prisoners will earn £14 for a 40-hour week, working five days a week, 52 weeks of the year, with no holiday.

They
 must return to their respective jails at the end of every shift and 
only inmates with between six to 18 months left on their jail terms 
qualify for the project.

The goal of the restaurant is to 
reduce the chances of re-offending as 74 per cent of prisoners with no 
job or accommodation currently commit another crime within a year.

The
 results of the restaurant in Surrey show a dramatic impact on this with
 only 10 per cent of those who have worked at the diner reoffending 
within a year.

In addition to providing a new employment route after leaving jail the Clink charity also assists prisoners with things like CVs and disclosure forms.

The restaurant has a strict zero tolerance policy – and introduces father figures to prisoners who may never have been told off or indeed praised.

It is also hoped that providing a direct link between prisoners and the public will help to change perceptions about prisoners.

Everything at the restaurant – from full meals to biscuits and bread – is made from scratch by the prisoners. Even the tables and chairs have been made by offenders, and the food is sourced from a prison farm at HMP Prescoed.

The restaurant, which will open its doors on September 19 will serve breakfast and lunch between Monday and Friday, but initially at least will not offer alcohol.

If the restaurant proves as successful as its forerunner in Surrey the plan is to open two more Clink restaurants every year for the next four years at prisons across the country.
