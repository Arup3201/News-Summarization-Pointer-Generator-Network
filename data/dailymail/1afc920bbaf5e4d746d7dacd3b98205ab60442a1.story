A teenager who killed her best friend in a car accident when she ‘showed off’ driving into a blind bend and collided with a tree just four months after passing her test was today jailed for six months.

Naomi Jones, 19, of Wesham, Lancashire, admitted causing the death of Elysia Ashworth, 17, of St Annes, by careless driving after crashing her Vauxhall Corsa near Blackpool Airport in July 2011.

The pair had been close friends since the age of 13, regularly had sleepovers at each other's houses and Jones had even gone on holiday to Cyprus with Miss Ashworth's family three years ago.

Blackpool Sixth Form College student Jones, who wanted to become a teacher, admitted careless driving at her Preston Crown Court trial last month in which she was cleared of dangerous driving.

Jones lost control of the car on the narrow, uneven road and failed to negotiate the left-hand bend, which left rear seat passenger Miss Ashworth with multiple injuries. She died two days later.

The car hit two bumps in the derestricted Division Lane in quick succession, and an accident investigator estimated the speed at point of impact with the tree at between 30mph and 35mph.

Her approach speed must have been more than 35mph, the jury heard. Judge Christopher Cornwall said the verdict should not be questioned but he believed it was not far short of dangerous driving.

He told her: ‘There seems to have been every conceivable reason that you should have reduced your speed on that road.

‘There is no doubt in my mind that the considerable jolt you experienced ought to have acted as a warning that your speed was unacceptably fast.

‘There was no evidence of braking; only a desperate attempt to steer around the corner which failed.’

Judge Cornwall accepted she was not racing but pointed out ‘there may however have been an element of showing off to your friends in the car and those following’.

'This is an accident that could have happened to only someone like you who was driving at a wholly unacceptable speed'

Judge Christopher Cornwall

He continued: ‘I do not accept this is an accident that could have happened to anyone. This is an accident that could have happened to only someone like you who was driving at a wholly unacceptable speed.’

Jones, whose mother had bought her the car as a present, will serve her sentence in a young offenders’ institution. She was given a 12-month driving ban and ordered to take an extended re-test.

Jones said she was ‘completely devastated’ at the loss of her best friend. Tearfully giving evidence, she said she had broken her left arm and right ankle in the crash, requiring reconstructive surgery.

She had had to use a wheelchair for two months and still had pain in her ankle. She was undergoing counselling and psychotherapy after she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Life cut short: Elysia Ashworth (left and right), known as 'Elly', had been preparing to take her driving test and wanted to study performing arts after her final year of studies at King Edward Queen Mary School in Lytham

She suffered nightmares and flashbacks about the accident.

‘There has not been a day since the accident that I have not thought about the accident and Elly (Miss Ashworth),’ Jones said in a statement to police given several months after the crash.

'I have been left completely devastated by the consequences of this accident but I know whatever I am going through does not compare to the suffering felt by Elly's family and my thoughts are with them always'

‘I have been left completely devastated by the consequences of this accident but I know whatever I am going through does not compare to the suffering felt by Elly's family and my thoughts are with them always.’

Jones was re-taking her A-levels after her studies were affected by the crash.

Another girl in the car, Ellen Richardson, also suffered serious injuries in the collision but was recovering and was studying at university, the court heard.

Miss Ashworth had been preparing to take her driving test and wanted to study performing arts after her final year of studies at King Edward Queen Mary School in Lytham.

On the night of the crash, the girls were planning to meet friends in Lytham but took a detour when Miss Ashworth had asked her to drive past the home of her boyfriend whom she had argued with.

'In circumstances such as these there is no direct relationship between the sentence of the court and on the other hand the inexpressible grief of Elysia's family'

Judge Christopher Cornwall

Miss Ashworth's parents, Chris and Maxine, had written to the judge before the trial to express their feelings of injustice that their daughter's life had ended and Jones's would continue.

He said he had also read their ‘intensely moving’ victim impact statements.

The families of the victim and the defendant sat together in the public gallery at the trial but today they were separated in court with Jones's parents flanked by a uniformed police officer.

Judge Cornwall said: ‘In circumstances such as these there is no direct relationship between the sentence of the court and on the other hand the inexpressible grief of Elysia's family... the value of Elysia's life is beyond all measurement and calculation.’

Mr and Mrs Ashworth made no comment as they left court.

Education: Jones was a student at Blackpool Sixth Form College (pictured) and wanted to become a teacher

Michael Shorrock QC, defending, said a suspended custodial sentence or a high community order could be imposed. He said Jones had to ‘live forever’ knowing that she had killed her best friend.

He added it was a lack of attention, probably momentary, which caused her to lose control but the judge rejected that view.

'She has expressed genuine remorse. This offence has had serious consequences as far as she is concerned'

Michael Shorrock QC, defending

Mr Shorrock said: ‘She has expressed genuine remorse. This offence has had serious consequences as far as she is concerned.

‘What possible purpose can be served in a case like this to send a young girl to prison? What she did could have happened to anyone. It came about through inexperience.’

He said it was ‘an accident waiting to happen’ with the former layout of the road, but that the ‘overwhelming probability’ was that would not have happened today after changes had been made.

Mr Shorrock said her ‘supportive, loving family’ would help Jones deal with the ‘terrible, terrible’ consequences of her driving and that she had already been ‘severely punished’.
