An independent Scotland would find itself at the back of the queue to get into the EU, David Cameron claimed today.

The Prime Minister said Scotland would have to wait its turn behind Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro before it would be readmitted.

Mr Cameron's provocative remarks come after the Scottish Tories announced that they now backed full income tax powers for the Edinburgh Government - if the country voted to stay in the United Kingdom.

David Cameron told workers at an electrical goods warehouse in Newark that Scotland would not automatically get back into the EU if it left the UK. He said the country would have to apply like every other country

David Cameron risked a Conservative backlash by going much further than Labour in offering new powers to Scotland in a bid to persuade voters to reject independence later this year.

The PM's remarks are also likely to infuriate Scottish nationalists who insist that the country would not even have to reapply for membership of the EU if it voted for independence.

Mr Salmond has predicted that negotiations to stay in the EU 'will be completed within the 18-month period between a yes vote in September and achieving independence in March 2016'. 

But European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has said it would be 'extremely difficult, if not impossible' for Scotland to join. 

Today Mr Cameron insisted Scotland would have to 'queue up' like all other countries trying to get into the Brussels club.

He also hit out at Alex Salmond's decision to block Scots living in England from taking part in September's independence referendum.

Mr Cameron said it was a 'source of regret' that Scottish people living in the rest of the UK would not be able to vote in the poll - but insisted that the decision was Mr Salmond's.

The PM made the remarks on the campaign trail in Newark this morning ahead of Thursday's by-election.

He said: 'If Scotland vote for independence they are no longer members of the EU and it's become clearer and clearer since this campaign started that they would have to reapply to join the EU and as such, as an independent country, they would have to queue up as it were behind other countries - for instance those in the western Balkans that are already on the path towards membership.

'This is yet another reason why I very much hope that the Scottish people will vote no, will vote to remain in the United Kingdom. I think we're a successful family of nations all bringing something to this United Kingdom.

'Let's hope that we'll stay together. I think the risks of separation are very great.'

Mr Cameron was in Newark campaigning on behalf of the Conservative candidate Robert Jenrick in the upcoming by-election, where he is desperate to hold off UKIP's challenger Roger Helmer

Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia are all categorised as candidate countries by the European Union, meaning they are in the process of integrating their laws with the EU.

Mr Cameron said he was 'confident' that the No campaign would win and said the issue of Europe was just one of the risks.

He added: 'The risk that outside the UK you wouldn't keep the pound, the risk that outside the UK you've got to reapply to the EU, the risk that outside the UK you wouldn't have such a strong economy with so many jobs and you know in the end its a positive argument I'm making because I think the UK has been a great success story.

'We're there for each other. You know when there was a banking crisis and a big Scottish bank goes down you've got the whole of the UK there to support that bank and that economy. We're stronger and better off together.

'We obviously have great rivalry on the football field and rugby field and one or two other things but we're a family of nations and I hope we stay together.'

Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson today u-turned on her previous opposition to further devolution by backing plans to hand the Holyrood Parliament full income tax powers 

Some Tories warned the move would fuel resentment in England and disenfranchise Scots who do not want the Scottish Parliament to have chance to levy swingeing new taxes on the better off.

MP Philip Davies said: ‘This is an idiotic idea that will only serve to hasten the break-up of the UK.

'How can you have a referendum where you get more independence whether you vote yes or no?

'Where does that leave people who want to preserve the Union as it is?’

Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson meanwhile today came out in support of full tax raising powers for Scotland. She said Holyrood was like 'a tricycle' where politicians can spend without any accountability for their actions in the tax system.

She has pledged to 'take the stabilisers off' and give the Scottish Government full control over income tax if it votes No to independence, as part of the Tories' devolution offering drafted by former Leader of the House of Lords, Tom Strathclyde.

Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have backed the proposals, Ms Davidson said.

Launching the report of the Strathclyde Commission in Glasgow, Ms Davidson said: 'What we have at the moment is like a tricycle, what the Scotland Act 2012 brings in is a bike with stabilisers, and what this builds on is taking the stabilisers off.

First Minister Alex Salmond has dismissed promises by the unionist parties to hand more powers to Edinburgh in the event of a 'No' vote. He has also insisted that an independent Scotland will not have to reapply to join the European Union

'So it does allow MSPs to take decisions not just over the rates of taxation that we levy, but it also allows them to vary one or more.

'It allows them to introduce a new band of income tax. It allows them to find the formula that best allows the work that the particular government of the day wants to carry out and has a mandate for in Scotland.

'I think that flexibility shows a responsibility.'

Scottish VAT receipts should also be given to the Scottish Parliament, according to the Strathclyde Commission.

Holyrood should be given more responsibility on some welfare issues, particularly where a cash benefit is related to a devolved policy area such as housing benefit and attendance allowance, it said.

All three parties supporting Better Together are now signed up to giving Edinburgh more powers if the country votes to stay in the UK.
