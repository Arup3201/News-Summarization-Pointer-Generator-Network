In a damning indictment of community policing, one in four people has never seen a bobby walking the beat.

Despite millions of pounds being poured into making the forces of law and order more visible, the streets are still too often devoid of that reassuring presence.

Even the ‘Blunkett bobbies’ designed for just that purpose are seen infrequently.

Damning indictment of community policing: The revelations will reignite controversy about police efficiency

High visibility: The Home Office spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training civilian staff to become PCSOs

The disturbing findings were uncovered in a survey of almost 50,000 by the Home Office.

The British Crime Survey discovered that 55 per cent of the public had seen police officers or police community support officers walking the beat at least once a month.

But this fell to one in seven, or 14 per cent, when they were asked if they see officers on a daily basis.

And 25 per cent said they had not at any stage seen either a fully-fledged police officer or PCSO on the beat.

PCSOs, introduced by David Blunkett when he was Home Secretary, are supposed to spend the bulk of their time pounding the streets.

The Home Office spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training the civilian staff, who do not have proper police powers and cannot make arrests. The revelations will reignite controversy about police efficiency.

One
of the most common demands from members of the public is for more 
officers on the beat to provide reassurance that they are being 
protected from thugs and burglars.

But
Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary said recently that fewer 
than one in ten uniformed officers in some forces are available to man 
the front line at any one time.

Police
spending almost doubled, from £7.72billion in 1998/1999 to 
£14.55billion a decade later. The number of officers increased from 
124,756 in March 1998, to a peak of around 141,000.

Pioneering: David Blunkett introduced PCSOs when he was Home Secretary

But, while officer numbers were increasing dramatically, the proportion of time an officer actually spends on patrol fell, from 15.3 per cent to 13.8 per cent.

Police budgets are being cut as part of the Government’s austerity measures – with forces threatening to axe around 16,000 police officers.

Last night Roy Rudham, chairman of the UK Neighbourhood Watch Trust, said: ‘It has always been a concern of people that they do not see police officers on the street and with the cuts being implemented the likelihood is they will see even fewer officers.

‘That will especially be the case if crime goes up and police resources are stretched to the absolute limit.’

The Home Office survey also found that only half of the public – 52 per cent – were confident that the authorities were effective at reducing anti-social behaviour. And just 41 per cent felt the authorities were effective in bringing louts to justice.

The situation on police visibility has
improved. In 2006, four out of ten people said they had never witnessed
a police officer or PCSO on the streets.

But it will be considered poor progress for the massive investment in extra police and PCSOs.

The
survey also found that only 4 per cent had used the online crime maps 
introduced by the Home Office to give people a greater idea of crime 
levels on their street and to increase police accountability.

When the maps were launched at the start of this year, the website crashed – apparently due to high demand.

In its report, Her Majesty’s 
Inspectorate of Constabulary found that there are more officers on duty 
on a Monday morning than at any other time of the week – and the fewest 
just after midnight on Friday when drunken violence soars.

Antiquated shift patterns, court 
hearings and training requirements mean that in two forces – 
Bedfordshire and Devon and Cornwall – only 9 per cent of officers can 
actually tackle crime, it said.

The
watchdog found many other forces fared little better, with an average 
of 12 per cent of officers available to catch crooks and keep people 
safe.

Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Denis O’Connor also highlighted how one in three members of the police workforce is not employed in a front-line role.

These include staff working in personnel, maintenance and administration.

HMIC is predicting the loss of 16,100 officers by 2015, along with up to 1,800 community support  officers and 16,100 civilian staff, because of budget cuts.

But it says there is so much waste that £1billion – the equivalent of a 12 per cent cut in government funding – could be axed without any reduction in police availability.

This would be achieved by getting police out from behind their desks. Critics say repeated promises by Labour to cut red tape failed to deliver.

Police Minister Nick Herbert said: ‘We know the public want their local police to be visible and responsive to their concerns.

And the police want to be out in their local communities stopping crime, catching criminals and helping victims.

‘That’s why we have swept away central targets and red tape to free up more officers for the frontline.’
