Fears that Premier League television revenue would help Manchester United or Manchester City sign Sergio Busquets are behind the Catalan club’s fast-tracking of the player’s contract extension.

The Spain international’s current deal runs until 2018 but despite having three years left on his contract, the club have offered him a two-year extension and a pay rise that will take his salary to £7.4m and see him become the fifth-highest earner at the club behind Leo Messi, Neymar, Andres Iniesta and Luis Suarez.

The announcement last week of the Premier League’s latest television deal sent shockwaves through Spanish football and Barcelona director Raul Sanllehi met with Busquets’ agent Josep Maria Orobitg this week to discuss improved terms.

Manchester City sporting director Txiki Begiristain and Chief Executive Ferran Soriano know Busquets and Orobitg – who is also Pep Guardiola’s agent – well from their days at Barcelona.

Manchester United’s interest is understood to have been driven by Louis Van Gaal who wants the club to stop the indiscriminate buying of forward players and bring in a holding midfielder that he can build a team around.

Paris Saint-Germain have also made their interest known with speculation claiming they had already bid £56m for the World Cup winner.

In return for Busquets' pay-hike Barcelona want the player’s buy-out clause raised from the current £111m mark to £130m in a symbolic gesture that will ward off the Manchester clubs.

With elections at the end of the season current president Josep Bartomeu knows the photograph of him sat down with Busquets prolonging his commitment to the club he debuted for in 2008 will help his campaign.

The club are confident the player will put pen to paper after next week’s first-leg last-16 Champions League match with Manchester City at the Etihad.
