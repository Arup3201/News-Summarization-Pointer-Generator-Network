Whitney Berridge took an overdose after trolls texted her taunts about the death of her mother who hanged herself at their family home nearly two years earlier, an inquest has heard

A teenage girl took an overdose after a troll texted her taunts about the death of her mother who hanged herself at their family home nearly two years earlier, an inquest has heard.

Whitney Berridge, 15, was still mourning the death of her mother Shanie and had told relatives that she wanted to be with her again, the inquest at Alton heard.

The hearing was told that Whitney’s 
mother was found hanged at the then family home in the Popley 
area of Basingstoke on May 6, 2012.

Leigh-Ann O’Leary, Whitney’s aunt who 
she lived with, told the coroner that her mother’s death had affected 
the schoolgirl deeply.

She
 said: 'She has said she wanted to be with her mum when she first came 
to live with me and she told me the story of what really happened the 
day her mum died.

'Whitney 
did find it difficult, she burst out crying when she told me she found 
her mother hanging. She told me she saw her mum hanging there and went 
upstairs and put earphones on and stayed in bed for four-and-a-half 
hours.'

Ms O’Leary said that
 Whitney was sensitive about any comments about her mother and had 
recently received a text message from a boy taunting her about her 
mother's death, which told her to go and kill herself, 'like your mother did'.

She added that Whitney had left a video message saying she intended to kill herself on the day she died.

The hearing was told that the schoolgirl took an overdose of medication that he had for a condition she suffered from.

She died later that evening of April 19 at the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke.

Hundreds of people gathered in Basingstoke's War Memorial Park on Monday April 28 to remember the teenager on what would have been her 16th birthday. They let off pink balloons, as it was her favourite colour.

North Hampshire coroner Andrew Bradley
 recorded an open verdict saying that because of Whitney’s age she could
 not have had a 'settled intention' to commit suicide.

He
 said: 'It’s a sad matter. The sadness of this case is that I 
adjudicated the case of Shanie Berridge who is Whitney’s mother in 
circumstances which were equally sad.

'The effect that had on Whitney I think none of us can estimate because she is the one who found her.

'How much that played on Whitney’s mind we shall never know, it’s clear she missed her mum, she loved her mum very much.

'The sensitivities she felt at any criticism of her or her mum were deeply felt, she had very low self-esteem, she had previously self-harmed and had previously taken an overdose.'

Flowers laid at a tree in memory of the teenager. North Hampshire coroner Andrew Bradley recorded an open verdict saying that because of Whitney's age she could not have had a 'settled intention' to commit suicide

He added: 'In order to find a verdict of suicide I have to be satisfied that she had a settled intention to die, that she no longer wanted to be with us.

'The view I take is that at 15 she couldn’t take that settled decision.'

Prior to the inquest, Ms O’Leary told the Basingstoke Gazette: 'Whitney and her mum were very close.

'When Shanie died, Whitney died with her.

'Something absolutely changed her when her mum died.'

Whitney had been studying for her GCSE exams at the Everest Community Academy.

Julie Rose, principal, said: 'She was a lively, interesting young lady who had her life ahead of her and unfortunately has been taken away and it has hit our students very hard and we are having to work quite hard to support them.'

Hundreds of friends gathered in Basingstoke’s War Memorial Park on April 28 to remember Whitney on what would have been her 16th birthday.

They released pink balloons, her favourite colour, and lit candles in her memory.
