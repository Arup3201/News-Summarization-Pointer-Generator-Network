The family of a 22-year-old man who died after he was hit by a train following an altercation at a railway station have spoken of the loss of their 'ray of sunshine'.

Ryan Harrison, from Woking, Surrey, was with a friend at Guildford station at 11.40pm on Saturday when he became involved in the confrontation which involved a number of other men.

Shortly after the altercation, Mr Harrison was fatally injured when he became stuck between the platform edge and the train as it moved away.

Three men were arrested on suspicion of murder and later released on bail.

In a statement issued through British Transport Police, Mr Harrison’s family said: 'Ryan was the biggest, brightest ray of sunshine for us. He loved life, his family and his friends.'

The family statement continued: 'He was a brother, son and boyfriend - we were so lucky to have him in our lives.

'He always looked so smart and gorgeous. He was ambitious in life and loved to party. He was a true sun worshipper and always had to have a tan.

'His family have been totally devastated by his loss, and we ask to be left in peace and given time to grieve.

'We would like to thank everyone for their kind words and tributes - we take strength from seeing how much he was loved by everyone that knew him.

'He had the biggest, kindest heart, and a bright light has been turned off in all of us that knew and loved him.

'Rest in peace Ryan, sleep tight our darling.'

South East Coast Ambulance Service paramedics attended the incident but Mr Harrison was pronounced dead at the scene.

Two 19-year-old men, from Guildford, were arrested at the scene while a third man, from Cranleigh, handed himself into a police station in Guildford later.

All three who were held on suspicion of murder have been released until a date in May while police inquiries continue.

Officers are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death and are examining CCTV footage.

A family friend said Mr Harrison, of 
Woking, Surrey, had moved with his father to Spain to start a business 
but came back in September last year.

Daloney Carlton, partner of Mr 
Harrison’s father Tony, said: ‘He came back in September because he 
missed his friends and moved in with his girlfriend.

‘I don’t know what happened but I think he was with his girlfriend at the station.

‘He was a lovely lad and his father is in pieces. He is flying back in a couple of days but can’t even talk at the moment.’

Ryan's devastated friends and loved 
ones have written tribute messages on Facebook, while his girlfriend 
Jaime-Leigh Egerton, 20, posted two poignant pictures of the pair 
together - including one of them sharing a tender kiss.

Others laid floral tributes and touching handwritten notes at the station where Ryan died.

One note, signed by 'Charlie', said: "Ryan, I can't get my head around that you've gone.

'I keep thinking you'll call any minute and come out with something stupid like you usually do!

'You have been an amazing best friend to me and I will miss you dearly.

'We are all trying to stick together and help one another through.

'I promise to look after your little 'flee' [sic] Jaime Leigh. You were a brother to me.

'I've had to say goodbye to you so many times when you've gone to Zante, Spain etc.

'But what did we say instead to stop me crying? "This isn't goodbye, it's I'll see you soon."

'So for now, my darling, sleep tight and I will see you soon.

'Love you forever and always, your little Charlie xxxxxxx'.

Detective Chief Inspector Iain Miller,
senior investigating officer, said: 'Our thoughts remain with Ryan’s 
family as they try to come to terms with what happened. This is clearly a
very painful and difficult time for them.

'The station was cordoned off until 
the early hours of Sunday morning while forensic officers conducted a 
thorough search and my team of detectives are working to establish the 
full circumstances surrounding Ryan’s death, which we are currently 
treating as suspicious.

'Ryan’s family will have many 
questions about the circumstances leading up to his death. We are 
working to piece together the full picture of events and will do 
everything we can to establish exactly what took place on Saturday 
night.

'We’re making local inquiries, 
including speaking to people in the area and trawling through hours of 
CCTV footage, but we also know there were a number of other people at 
the station at the time.

'If you were there and haven’t yet come forward, please get in touch.'
