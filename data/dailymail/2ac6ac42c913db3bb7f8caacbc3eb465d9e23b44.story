Arsenal have completed the signing of Nice goalkeeper David Ospina for £3.2million, according to the French side's manager Claude Puel.

Ospina alerted interest from the Gunners following a series of impressive performances for Colombia at the World Cup - helping them to reach the quarter-finals before losing to hosts Brazil.

The 25-year-old joins the north London side on a reported four-year deal. Puel revealed the news of Ospina's departure on Sky Sports News saying: 'It is confirmed, yes. At 25 years old it is important for him to experience another championship, so it is a fantastic move for him.'

It was believed that the 25-year-old was initially pinpointed as a ready-made replacement for back-up keeper Lukasz Fabianski, who recently joined Swansea, with Wojciech Szczesny the current No 1 at the club.

However, Arsene Wenger has insisted that performances will dictate who holds the No 1 position this season at the club, as Ospina looks to stake a claim for a first-team spot.

'You know at the start Szczensy will be 
the No. 1, then again it will be down to performances and, if Ospina shows
 that he is better, he will play,' he told ESPN.

Puel has no doubt in his mind though that his former keeper can become an instant success at the Emirates and land himself the No 1 jersey.

He added:
 'I think he can take the No. 1 spot at Arsenal because his qualities are
 very, very strong. He is very good with his feet, with his arms, and he
 knows soccer. He is a very, very good player.'

Ospina will join Alexis Sanchez and Mathieu Debuchy as new signings at the Emirates next season, while the club has also been linked with a move for Porto's £35 million-rated defensive midfielder William Carvalho.

They are also believed to be close to sealing a deal to take highly-rated Southampton defender Calum Chambers to the club for £12million.

Wenger believes that the new additions the club has made now means they will make a sustained challenge for the Premier League title this season, after falling somewhat short over the last few years.

Speaking at a press conference ahead of his side's pre-season friendly with New York Red Bulls, Wenger agreed that Arsenal were looking to repeat the success they have enjoyed in the past.

'That's what our target is but still I think we have been very consistent,' he said.

'It was a very different period initially because we built a new stadium and had to pay it back. We survived at the top level but we want more.

'We are now on an even ground with the other clubs than we were five or six years ago.'
