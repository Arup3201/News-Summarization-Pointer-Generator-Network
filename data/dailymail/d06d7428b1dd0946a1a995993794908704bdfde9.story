ITV's unfortunate tradition of missing vital World Cup goals continued on Thursday night after its online service stopped working as Brazil's Neymar stepped up to take a penalty, furious viewers said.

ITV Player's live coverage cut out at least twice in the second half of the host's match with Croatia, including as the tournament favourites went 2-1 up in Sao Paulo. 

In 2010 ITV was forced to apologise after it missed England's first World Cup goal against the United States, after it accidentally showed a car advert instead.

More than a million watching its HD service saw Glen Johnson's fourth minute throw in - but the game disappeared - and then returned with Steven Gerrard running off celebrating.

After Thursday night's problems ITV Player users said the broadcasters problems during the tournament is now as much of a 'World Cup tradition as England losing on penalties'. 

Responding to a barrage of criticism on Twitter, the service said on its feed: 'We're seeing unprecedented numbers of users during the game.

'We apologise for any inconvenience, we're working hard to resume normal service.'

It later added: 'We're so sorry for the disruption tonight. It wasn't planned and we know it came at a crucial time during the match. Apologies again.'

Several users vented their frustration on the microblogging site.

ITV's first night of World Cup coverage was beset with other problems as protesters hurled rocks at its beach-side studio.

A gang on Copacabana beach pelted the studio with stones and smashed sections of the glass frontage.

ITV host Adrian Chiles was inside the 
studio at the time of the attack, along with several pundits including 
ex-Arsenal and England right-back Lee Dixon, former Italy centre-back 
Fabio Cannavaro and 1998 World Cup winner Patrick Vieira.
