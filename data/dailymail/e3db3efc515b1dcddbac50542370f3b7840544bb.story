Saturday dawned bright and cold over Birmingham and in the local media talk of Aston Villa's future was to the fore again.

In the Birmingham Mail there were suggestions that a millionaire from Azerbaijan may be interested in buying the club from Randy Lerner. Peculiarly, he didn't have a name.

Former Villa striker Andy Gray revealed that he has been using his time working in Qatar to sell the prospects of the club to the wealthy in the Middle East.

Aston Villa fans are upset with the way that owner Randy Lerner is running the club

'But try as I might to encourage one of the sheikhs to invest, I find it difficult,' he lamented.

In the Shakespeare pub near Birmingham New Street station, Villa fans seemed understandably unexcited.

'We need a new owner,' said Paul Wilkin from Solihull. 'More urgently than that, though, we need a new manager. Much more of this football and people will just stop going.'

Saturday was another hard day for boss Paul Lambert. He was booed as Villa lost to Liverpool.

The planned 'eight-minute' protest on the Holte End didn't happen but Lambert knows how people feel.

'We haven't scored for eight hours, have won 17 home games out of 67 and Lambert wonders why we are moaning,' said Jonathan Fear, of the Vital Villa website.

'We are a big club and going nowhere. I look at clubs like Southampton and ask myself: "Why is that not us?"' 

Villa competed well with Liverpool for 20 minutes in the second half. That apart, though, Villa were poor.

Carlos Sanchez impressed, as did Fabian Delph for a spell and, sporadically, Christian Benteke.

Those close to the club say the latter two players will leave in the summer while another well-placed source says Lerner has never recovered from the acrimonious nature of Martin O'Neill's departure in 2010 and suffers from never having appointed a man with football experience to the board.

'After Martin, Lerner appointed Gerard Houllier and then Alex McLeish,' said the source. 'The O'Neill thing almost paralysed him and he made two bad appointments that have cost the club time and a lot of money.'

Fabian Delph was one of Villa's best players against Liverpool but could leave the club in the summer

For now Lambert is seen to be the problem and things may get worse. Next up in the Premier League are Arsenal and Chelsea.

On the platform at Aston station on Saturday evening, two Liverpool fans asked if I supported Villa.

'You must do,' said one. 'You just look so fed up.'
