Suspect: Jacob Salas, 32, was charged with causing injury to a foster child but could face more serious offences

An 11-month-old foster girl has died after a man who was looking after her put her head underneath his knee and caused her severe had injuries.

Orien Hamilton, who was taken from her family seven months after she was born with drugs in her system, died on Sunday while she was in state care.

Jacob Salas, who was looking after the child while the foster parent was at work, has been arrested after admitting to police he may have caused the child's injuries, according to KVUE News.

The 32-year-old dialled 911 on Saturday, claiming young Orien was choking on a piece of food.

She was then taken to Dell Children's Hospital in Austin, Texas, where she later passed away.

But when officers began questioning him, they found his account was inconsistent with the child’s injuries after police found bruising on her left ear.

Cedar Park police have charged Salas with injury to a child, and are working with the Williamson County District Attorney's office to determine whether he will face more serious offences.

If they find enough evidence, he could be charged with capital murder.

The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) said Orien was placed in a San 
Antonio foster home until December last year.

She was then transferred to her 
aunt’s home in Cedar Park because of the state's policy which urges foster children are places with their relatives.

The
Lutheran Social Services (LSS) said Hamilton's aunt was called into 
work and was not in the house at the time of the tragic incident.

The
agency said they were also not aware Salas cared for the child until 
they received the call informing them of what had happened.

Both
DFPS and LSS conducted a background check on Hamiton’s aunt. The 
child’s aunt was verified as a foster parent by LSS on Oct. 7.

Child
Protective Services said they have removed three other children, ages 
three, five, and seven, living in the home at the time of the incident. 
Those children have been placed with another relative.

LSS
said they will conduct their own comprehensive investigation into the 
incident. DFPS said they are investigating the agency’s actions in the 
case as well.

Salas remains in the Williamson County Jail with no bond.

A statement from the Lutheran Social 
Services' said they were informed yesterday of a child who was taken to 
hospital with possible head trauma.

'The
Fostering Connection program is a Child Protective Services (CPS), 
state sponsored program that allows Kinship programs – programs that 
place children removed from their birth families by CPS into the homes 
of relatives or 'kin' instead of in foster homes – to be verified as 
foster care parents. 

'The 
child unfortunately passed away early this morning and an unverified 
caregiver – meaning the caregiver was not the foster care parent on the 
approved and verified list of caregivers – was arrested.'
