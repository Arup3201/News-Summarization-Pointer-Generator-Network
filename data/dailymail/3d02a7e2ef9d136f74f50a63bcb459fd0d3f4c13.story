This is 
the Transfer Column, where Sportsmail delivers the very latest news, 
gossip and rumours from around the football world three times a week.

In
today's column: In-demand Basle winger Mohamed Salah could be on his way to Liverpool after being spotted at Anfield, Barcelona have joined Manchester United and Real Madrid in the chase for Ilkay Gundogen and Yohan Cabaye still has eyes for PSG.

Liverpool's pursuit of Egyptian star Mohamed Salah seems to be reaching its climactic point after his European representative was spotted at Anfield on Saturday.

In-demand: Basle's Mohamed Salah has attracted interest from the likes of Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United

Salah has been grabbing headlines with Swiss side Basle for the past 12 months and his performances in the Champions League against Chelsea, in particular, this season have made him one of the hottest properties of the January window.

Basle are willing to sell the 21-year-old who has been dubbed 'the Egyptian Messi' for around £15million. He can play anywhere across the front line, is technically good and has blistering pace. He has scored six goals in 22 games for Basle this season and 17 in 26 internationals for his country.

Sportsmail revealed Liverpool's interest in September and it follows interest from Tottenham who have maintained a watching brief.

Also interested: Tottenham

Also interested: United

Also interested: Chelsea

Tottenham sporting director Franco Baldini watched Salah against Chelsea in November but they may hold off bidding for him with a central striker more their priority for January.

Chelsea and Manchester United have also shown interest in Salah but they will also face competition from the likes of Inter Milan and Monaco.

United's concern has been who actually represents him with various agents claiming to have the mandate to represent him. However, it is German-based SPOCS agency, with directors Aylmer Woods and Sascha Empacher, who are understood to be the contracted representatives in Europe.

Classy: Basle are expected to listen to offers of £10m for defender Fabian Schar

Similar questions have been raised about Salah's club-mate Fabian Schar. The classy centre-back has attracted attention from Tottenham, Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and others. Basle were unwilling to sell the 21-year-old in January initially but they sense the interest is that strong they will relent if anyone offers around £10million.

Schar does not have an agent as such but uses a lawyer for negotiations. However, he is no intellectual slouch himself having qualified as a Swiss banker with Raiffeisen.

Dundee United's Tannadice Park has seen attendances boosted by the arrival of scouts from far and wide of late.

Ryan Gauld has been the name on most people's lips while defender John Souttar and left-back Andy Robertson are also coming under close scrutiny.

Teenage kicks: 17-year-old Ryan Gauld has been attracting scouts to Dundee United

The 17-year-old Gauld voiced a desire to sample life abroad at the weekend and he could get his wish. Roma and Juventus were among those represented in the stands during Saturday's 4-1 defeat of Hearts.

Gauld had a quite game by his standards but they will be back while Everton, Liverpool, Arsenal, Sunderland and Manchester United have been regular visitors.

Wolves goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey is being watched by West Ham United. The 26-year-old is fully fit again after a cruciate injury last year and a knee injury in August. He had a loan spell at Yeovil and returned to action for Wales in November. Sam Allardyce is looking for back-up for Jussi Jaaskelainen and Wolves are open to offers.

One in, one out? Wayne Hennesey has been lined up as a replacement for Jussi Jaaskelainen at West Ham,

Hennessey was a keeper with great potential at one stage and is keen to get his career back on track after a couple of setbacks. Liverpool, who have been scouting the likes of Lee Nicholls at Wigan, are also interested in Hennessey.

Manager Brendan Rodgers wants to increase competition with Brad Jones and Simon Mignolet. Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina is poised to move on permanently following his loan spell at Napoli. The Italians, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan and Arsenal are all maintaining interest in the Spain international with a deal likely for around £4.5million.

Barcelona are the latest side to make contact with the father of Ilkay Gundogan. The Borussia Dortmund midfielder is in demand with Real Madrid and Manchester United both keen to take him away from Germany.

German engineering: Ilkay Gundogan is a target for Manchester United, Real Madrid and now Barcelona

Irfan, Ilkay's father, insists a deal has yet to be agreed with Real despite strong suspicions one is in place and Dortmund acknowledging the player could go. That has prompted clubs to make more discreet enquiries with Irfan in the hope of gaining a footing in a deal that would cost around £24million.

Real Madrid are awaiting a decision imminently from Xabi Alonso on his future which could affect their next target and they are keeping a keen eye on the ongoing chatter that Paul Pogba's is unsettled at Juventus.

QPR are keeping a keen interest in Bradford City striker Nakhi Wells. Bradford are resigned to losing the 23-year-old who has 18 months left on contract.

Hot shot: Bradford are resigned to losing Nakhi Wells who has scored 14 goals this season

Leicester City, Nottingham Forest and Leeds United are also interested but Bradford want around £3million for the Bermuda international who has 14 goals this season.

Bradford chairman Julian Rhodes admitted: 'He can probably earn a lot more elsewhere, so if that’s the case and Nahki is not going to be here beyond this contract, we have to look at any offers if they come in, whether that’s in the next transfer window or the one after that.'

Yohan Cabaye has failed to dampen the speculation surrounding a pending move to Paris St Germain.

French fancy: Newcastle midfielder Yohan Cabaye has not ruled out a move to big spending PSG

Speaking on French TV beIN SPORT, the Newcastle midfielder said: 'As far as I know, there has been no contact with Paris Saint-Germain.

Who wouldn't want to join PSG today?' Newcastle want Cabaye to stay until the summer but an offer of around £16million would be difficult to resist.

Which international Premier League striker asked a girl on a date and when she refused promised to turn up at her shop every day until she relented. Four days later he sent in a friend to say 'Don't you know who he is?' The girl nodded before replying 'Yes and my boyfriend thinks he's rubbish too.'

The agent of Balazs Dzsudzsak, Jozsef Vorosbaranyi has played down talk that Fulham are close to signing the £12m-rated Hungarian winger from Dinamo Moscow.

'Fulham haven't contacted us, we haven't had talks,' Vorosbaranyi told SportKlub Television.

'When Martin Jol was their coach we had been in touch as he wanted to sign Balazs several times. But seeing the budget of Fulham I don't think they could've been able to make an agreement.

Feeling Hungary? Fulham are reported to be close to the £12m rated Balazs Dzsudzsak

'The fee Dinamo would have asked for the player might not be suitable for the English club. Now they have a new Dutch coach, I'm sure he knows Balazs well but we haven't had talks with them.'

Luuk De Jong has been discussed by Stoke City as their search for a striker continues. The 23-year-old surprised many suitors last year when he opted to join Borussia Monchengladbach from FC Twente in a £12m deal.

He has struggled to live up to his price tag in Germany and that has alerted the likes of Stoke to ask about a deal although the Germans would like to recoup their money.

Everton have added Alfred Finnbogasson to their list of striker targets, as reported in today's Daily Mirror, but Heerenveen want close to £8million for the Iceland international who has also interested West Ham, Newcastle and Celtic.

Cardiff are another Premier League side considering strikers in January. Manchester City's John Guidetti remains on the lists of many with clubs as diverse as Liverpool and Real Betis understood to be mulling over offers.

Saints alive! Southampton are the latest club interested in Rennes' Jonathan Pitroipa (left)

Southampton are among clubs watching Burkina Faso winger Jonathan Pitroipa at Rennes.

Monaco will challenge Chelsea for St Etienne bad boy Kurt Zouma. The 19-year-old defender is in demand although his 10 game suspension for his horrendous challenge on Sochaux's Thomas Guerbert has made it difficult for scouts to update reports ahead of January.

Manchester City, United, Arsenal and Swansea have all checked on him this season.
