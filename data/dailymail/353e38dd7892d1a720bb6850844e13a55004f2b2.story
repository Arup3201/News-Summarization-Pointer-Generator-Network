It is a sad indictment of the ruinous procession of owners who have occupied the boardroom at Elland Road over the last decade that Leeds United fans are welcoming convicted fraudster Massimo Cellino as their new man in charge.

There is a grim fatalism among the faithful, a sense that Britain’s most dysfunctional club will always make news for the wrong reasons, a trend that began 40 years ago with Brian Clough’s disastrous 44 days in charge immortalised in the book The Damned United.

One more owner marking his arrival at Elland Road with a series of eyebrow-raising quotes and seemingly illogical decisions is grist to the mill. Just like Clough telling Billy Bremner and Co to dump all their medals in the dustbin, Cellino’s wind of change is nothing more than a mild breeze to the Leeds fans.

Destined for failure? Cellino has hired an unproven manager and promised a return to the Premier League

The original Damned United: Legendary manager Brian Clough's 44-day stint at Leeds was a huge failure

The Italian has made a number of madcap 
moves since taking over in April after overturning a Football League 
ruling which deemed he was not a ‘fit and proper person’ to own a 
football club.

He shut the players’ canteen, told them to bring their 
own sandwiches, demanded they live in the city, and has now informed 
them they must buy their own match-day socks. 

Cellino hired Dave Hockaday as coach, a man who was sacked by non-League Forest Green Rovers after losing seven of eight games.

But
 he has promised to buy back their stadium ‘by November’ and get Leeds 
back into the Premier League within two years. He offers hope to fans 
who have been let down by owners and managers since chairman Peter 
Ridsdale, whose legacy of reckless spending is still felt at the club.

Lifelong Leeds fan Dave Simpson, who
 wrote The Last Champions, a book about Howard Wilkinson’s 1992 title 
winners, claimed even the decision to recruit Hockaday is defensible.

‘We’ve had big-name managers — Terry Venables, Peter Reid, Neil Warnock —
 none of them have ever done anything at Leeds, so it might be worth 
having a go on a complete unknown quantity,’ he said. 

There has 
been a marked turnaround in opinion about Cellino. When he first tried 
to take over in February, angry fans barricaded his car inside the West 
Stand car park.

Then a prankster released online a phone conversation
 where he ranted about Leeds striker Noel Hunt’s wages and the ‘f****** 
devil’ David Haigh (Leeds then managing director).

‘He tells it how it is in no uncertain terms and the fans relate to that because that’s a very Yorkshire trait,’ said Simpson.

Cellino,
 56, said this week that at the time of his buy-out, Leeds cost £125,000
 a day to run, of which £70,000 was essentially losses.

Fraudster? Cellino openly admitted the reason he sold McCormack is because he was Leeds best player

‘This club is going to have more 
quiet time and less problems now,’ he said, ‘and the people who used to 
rip the club off, they’re going to stop. I’ll protect the club from 
everyone, including myself.’

He claimed substantial cuts and a 
reduced wage bill were starting to reduce expenditure. But the immediate
 future of Leeds may be more turbulent than he expects, with at least a 
couple of sacked employees seeking legal advice about securing fair 
payouts from the club.

The effects of the new regime are already 
being felt among the staff. Three of their most loyal academy coaches 
were axed two weeks ago. Leigh Bromby, who played for Leeds from 2009 to
 2013, returned from a family holiday to a letter from academy director 
Neil Redfearn, telling him his services were no longer required.

Ditto 
Phil Wilson, head of coaching at the academy. Richard Naylor, a former 
club captain, had a meeting where the only representative of the club 
was a payroll officer. Goalkeeping coach Andy Leaning was also axed.

Goodbye: Naylor has a white rose tattooed on his upper arm, such is his affinity with the club

Naylor, such a diehard Leeds fan he had a
 white rose tattoo inked on his upper arm when he moved to Ipswich, was 
the most surprising departure. He coached the Under-18s to a league 
title last season and secured professional contracts for 14 out of 18 of
 his players — the best ever success rate at the club.

Bromby even 
offered to continue working with the Under-16s for free. ‘I love the 
club and I wanted to grow as a coach there,’ he said. ‘I’ve had a season
 ticket since I was a boy and so have my dad and granddad so I wanted to
 give something back. Richard and I are both local lads.’ 

Bromby 
said he ‘holds no grudges against Leeds’, and he is often called by 
first-team players for advice. ‘I hope Cellino can be a success. He 
seems to be stripping things back to basics with the players.’

Gone, 
too, is club captain and top scorer Ross McCormack, sold to Fulham for 
£11million. ‘I didn’t want to sell McCormack because for me, he was the 
best player we had,’ said Cellino. ‘He scored 29 goals.’

Replacement: Cellino has brought in Italian Tommaso Bianchi from Modena to fill void left by McCormack

New face: Goalkeeper Marco Silvestri has also moved to Elland Road from Italy

Cellino has looked to his native Italy 
for new blood, signing goalkeeper Marco Silvestri, midfielder Tommaso 
Bianchi and forward Souleymane Doukara. He also promised ‘five or six’ 
further signings.

Across Yorkshire, in a smart house in Harrogate, 
Bill Fotherby, former Leeds managing director, is not hopeful of the new
 regime. ‘Where’s the ambition there,’ he said, ‘to get rid of your best
 player?’

At 82, Fotherby, closely associated with the Howard 
Wilkinson era that brought the last title to Leeds, looks like the sort 
of chap who would slap you on the back and stuff a cigar in your mouth. 
He claims the club has been on a downhill spiral since Ridsdale took 
over.

‘Cellino is no different from the others,’ he said, ‘hiring a 
non-League manager to go into what should be a Premier League club, 
where’s the ambition there? Leeds has been raped of money and ambition 
for years now. When I was there we had 40,000 crowds every week and 
plans to expand to 60,000 seats. Now they’re happy if they get 20,000.

‘Leeds
 should be top six in the Premier League. A city this size with 
supporters as passionate as they are and they’ve been robbed by 
irresponsible owners who borrowed money on future gates. How dare they 
do that! It’s the fans who I feel sorry for.’
