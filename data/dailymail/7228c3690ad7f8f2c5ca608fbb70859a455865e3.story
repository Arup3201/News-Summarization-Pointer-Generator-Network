After one of the wettest and windiest winters in living memory, it is difficult to believe anything as delicate as a snowdrop could have survived the weeks of violent Atlantic storms. But in a small corner of the Berkshire countryside a sea of the celebrated white wild flowers - known as the 'harbingers of spring' - has blossomed despite daily drenchings and very little 
sunshine.

These delicate snowdrops have bloomed at Welford Park near Newbury and despite the appalling conditions experts say the crop is the best the area has seen for many 
years. And despite more 
torrential rain being forecast for the coming 24 hours, walkers and even
 their pets stopped to enjoy this wonder of the British spring.
