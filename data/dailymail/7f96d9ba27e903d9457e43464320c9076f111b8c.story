A grandfather caught a pair of mean-spirited traffic wardens removing snow from double yellow lines to make it appear as if drivers had purposely parked illegally.

Once the lines had been revealed, the over-officious inspectors had no hesitation in dishing out tickets on the vehicles left abandoned in Boston Street, Nottingham when heavy snow fell.

But pensioner Anthony Wilkinson spotted the wardens' underhand actions and embarked on an 18-month campaign to get the council to admit that the tickets should not have been issued.

He says the incident has brought to light a possible 
'culture of deception and disdain for the public' among parking industry employees.

Idea: CCTV footage showing the moment traffic wardens noticed cars parked on snow-covered double yellow lines on Boston Street in the centre of Nottingham on November 30, 2010

Mr Wilkinson had been left stranded in the city because of the heavy snow on November 30, 2010.

Quickly appreciating that the inspectors were up to no good, the 70-year-old grabbed his camera to snap the wardens' efforts to ensnare motorists at around 8.30pm.

Through a window above the road the grandfather of two observed the two inspectors issuing tickets to two cars having removed snow to reveal double yellow lines.

Mr Wilkinson then realised he had further evidence of the untoward behaviour in the form of CCTV shot from a camera positioned outside his office.

Although the cars did not belong to 
him, outraged Mr Wilkinson turned good Samaritan and decided to 
investigate if the actions of the over-zealous officers were fair.

Now after an 18 month battle in which 30 letters were sent Nottingham City Council has finally admitted to the semi-retired printer that the wardens were in the wrong.

Mr Wilkinson said: 'When I first contacted the council they told me the wardens had not moved the snow, they didn’t know I had the footage so it was then I decided to take it further.

'I thought ‘no, they’re, wrong’, I think it has highlighted a possible culture of deception and disdain for the public among the employees of the parking industry.

'It was one of the worst nights of snow of the year and there were people abandoning their cars elsewhere in the city.

'It was a very insignificant road, it’s not like these cars were blocking access and they could have been left there because of the heavy snow.

'There are places on this road you can park freely and I think that would have been made harder to see with the snow. It’s about common sense.

'I have nothing against parking restrictions and they can do a good job but I didn’t like it when I was told they hadn’t done it and I had CCTV showing they had.'

Despicable: Having revealed the double yellow lines, the CCTV footage shows the traffic wardens writing out a ticket for one of the cars parked on Boston Street

After the incident Nottingham City Council, which employed private firm NSL to enforce parking, continually denied the wardens had done anything wrong.

Now Mr Wilkinson has finally received a letter from Nottingham City Council stating that the fines had been cancelled and the tickets should not have been issued.

The letter reads: 'The conduct of the civil enforcement officers was not and would never be condoned by Nottingham City Council.

'In this instance the enforcement was certainly not fair or accurate and was not consistent with the high standards of enforcement expected.'

The council no longer uses NSL and its own staff now enforce parking regulations.

In a previous letter to Mr Wilkinson the council had stated that it did not have a 'specific protocol' for snow on yellow lines, but added that 'civil enforcement officers must be able to see the lines and the windscreen in order to be able to issue.

'This would normally cover snow, standing water, frost, leaves and similar.'

A spokesman from NSL said traffic wardens are not given any incentives, nor are they set targets, which is against the law.
