After being self-conscious about her size for years, Whitney Thore says she has never been happier now that she weighs 27 stone (378lbs).

The 30-year-old from North Carolina became famous in 2014 when a YouTube video of her performing called 'Fat Girl Dancing' went viral.

After uploading the clip, it quickly attracted millions of views and Whitney has now been given her own reality TV show as a result.

From YouTube to reality TV star: Whitney Thore, pictured on Lorraine today, has been given her own show following the popularity of her video 'Fat Girl Dancing'

Speaking to Lorraine Kelly on Lorraine this morning, Whitney said: 'I hope women can see someone they can identify with because bigger women are grossly under-represented in the media. 

'I hope I can be an inspiration.'

Whitney said she wants to use the TV show to prove size doesn't have to be a barrier to happiness.

She said: 'So often we think our bodies limit us. 

'For years, I didn't think I had permission to dance even though it's what makes me happiest. 

'I just hope everyone knows you can do whatever you want.'

At 27st, Whitney says she 'fat and fabulous': She wants to show size isn't a barrier to success

To a large extent, Whitney has already proved this with her video 'Fat Girl Dancing', which has received millions of hits since she uploaded it to YouTube.

The clip shows her energetically performing a professional-looking dance routine in a vest top and leggings.

She revealed on Lorraine how she used to love dancing when she was a teenager and a size 10.

But she stopped after her weight increased when she started at university because of polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCSO).

The 30-year-old thinks large women are under represented on TV so wants to change that with her TLC show

Whitney, pictured on her show which airs tomorrow, says she gained weight in part thanks to PCOS

She said: 'I never blamed all my weight gain on PCSO but it's certainly a contributing factor, coupled with the shame and stigma I suffered being a fat woman in America. 

'When I started college, I gained 100lb in one year. 

'I was undiagnosed for years and it totally turned my life around. 

'I had body issues for years, even when I was thin I had eating disorders, so to become fat and deal with the social and cultural perceptions of that and how the world viewed me... with every pound my value seemed to decrease.'

But Whitney said once she accepted her size and started dancing again, she started feeling more confident. 

So much so that she's willing to show off her figure in just a bikini as the cameras follow her as she hits the beach for her new reality series. 

She said: 'I'm 380lbs, I would love to lose some weight but I'm also the happiest I have ever been.'

She added that while she realises her physical health would be improved if she lost weight, because her size makes her at higher risk of heart disease and diabetes, she has learnt happiness is not about what you look like.

Whitney said: 'I want to lose weight but not I'm not obsessed with being skinny for the way it looks. 

'We place too much importance on the physical body and how people see us but happiness starts inside.

'We have this belief that fat people can't be pretty or smart or talented, I would love to dispel some of those stereotypes. I am fat and fabulous.'
