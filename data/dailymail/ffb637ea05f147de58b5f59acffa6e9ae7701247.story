Charles Greene, 52, was charged with aggravated murder, murder, aggravated robbery and kidnapping

Ohio police have arrested a man they suspect killed an elderly woman he sometimes worked for by stuffing her into a wishing well and leaving her to die.

Charles Greene was arrested by police in Columbus on Saturday and charged with killing Alyce Seff, 81, at a rental property she owned in German Village in July of 2008. 

Greene, 52, was charged in Franklin County Common Pleas Court with aggravated murder, murder, aggravated robbery and kidnapping.

One of Seff's neighbors found the landlady stuffed upside-down into the wooden well on the unoccupied property.  

The decomposition of the body indicated Seff  slowly asphyxiated over the course of three or four days.

There was blood splattered on a wall near the well, according to 10 TV. 

A search of the area did not turn up anything that could have been used as a weapon. 

Police think money was the motive for the murder as Seff was known to carry around a lot of cash.

A neighbor found Seff's body stuffed into the wooden well and there was blood splattered on a wall nearby 

Greene became a suspect after Seff's credit cards were found in his possession and her 1993 Ford Escort was discovered near his home after her death, the Columbus Dispatch reported. 

Columbus Sgt. Christ Holzhauser called it a 'sick death'.

He said: 'She basically was left in a decorative well in the backyard and left there to die, and we have no idea how long.'

'She suffered.'

Four detectives worked on the case, although two of them are now retired.

Greene has a criminal record which dates back to 1981 and includes charges of burglary, theft and drugs, NBC4i reported.
