Tragedy struck a Florida family after a bear broke into their yard and killed their dog.

The Bentley family, of Longwood, say they grew concerned when they could not find their 5-year-old Yorkie Toby on Monday, and that is when son David went looking for the animal.

He found him dead in the woods behind their house, beneath a 600-pound black bear.

'I came across a large black bear, probably 600 pounds. I walked up to it, probably about 10 feet from it and it still wouldn’t move. I kept making noise at it, and then it slowly walked away – and there was my parents' dog,' David told Bay News 9.

His mother Paula had called him hysterically after the dog went missing. 

'It was pretty bad knowing that I had to bring the dog back here for my mother and father to see. That dog meant the world to them.' 

He then added; 'It was laying on it like it was prey. It wasn’t a bag of trash it dragged off. It was a live dog.'

Paula broke down at the animal's death, telling Click Orlando, 'Toby, five pounds, that dog was the best.'

The family has reported seeing three black bears in the woods behind their house, and say on another occasion one of the bears broke in and took a swim in their pool. 

And while the family is devastated over the loss of their dog, they are also grateful it was just the dog that was killed.

Florida Fish and Wildlife is currently looking at measures to control the black bear population and prevent attacks

'My little nephew is the same size as the dog that was killed, so it could’ve easily been him,' said David.

'I have grandchildren that play out here. You constantly have to be around to make sure nothing comes out of the woods or in front of the houses,' Paula told Local 6.

A trap was also set up for the animals behind the Bentleys' home on Monday after their dog was killed.
