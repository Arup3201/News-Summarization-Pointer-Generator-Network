An obese dad who ballooned to almost 30 stone after being made redundant has lost half his weight after turning to Morris dancing.

Richard Landon, 47, binged on beer, pies and takeaways after being laid off from his job with Barclays bank after 25 years.

The dad-of-two, of Oldham, Lancs, tipped the scales at a hefty 28st 2lbs before deciding that something had to change.

Richard Landon, 47, weighed 30 stone after he binged on pies, beer and takeaways after losing his job

After cutting the calories and joining his local Morris dancing troupe, Richard lost 15 stone. He now weighs a healthy 13st 10lb and his waist has shrunk from 60 inches to just 34

Richard decided to rejoin Saddleworth Morris Men club after being forced to leave when he became too big to keep up.

After overhauling his calorie-laden diet and turning to the tradition folk dance he lost 15 stone, bringing his weight down to a healthy 13st 10lbs. His waist has shrunk from 60 inches to just 34.

He has even managed to find himself a new job as a call centre worker for a local council.

Richard said: 'I was devastated when I had to leave the Morris dancing team, and getting back on it is what spurred me on to lose the weight.

'When I was big I never knew if I was going to make it to the end of the dance, and on the way to one event I even split my trousers.

'I wasn’t giving the team my all and didn’t want to let them down so I had to quit.

'Now I’ve been back as part of the team since last November and I’ve lost even more weight as a result. It’s such a fantastic part of local tradition and I’m proud to be a part of it.'

Richard was a former member of the Morris dancing group, but had to quit after struggling to keep up. On one occasion he missed the start of a performance because his trousers split and his wife had to fix them

Richard originally joined his local team of Morris dancers in 2007 when his weight was around 19 stone.

During the time he was made redundant from his job and turned to food as a comfort his weight peaked.

He said: 'I’d had the same job since leaving school and it hit me very hard. The weight continued to pile on until I couldn’t even weigh myself on regular scales.

'On the journey to one Morris dancing event I split my breeches and missed the start because my wife Lesley had to go and sew them back up for me.

'I was ashamed to tell them why I’d missed the opening dance, but everyone was very supportive.

'But the weight continued to go on until I was forced to quit the team. I always missed dancing though and the drive to get back into it is what forced me to do something about my weight.'

Making a New Year’s resolution in January 2012 Richard decided to join his local WeightWatchers and went along with his mother for support.

He said: 'The hardest part was walking through the doors for that first meeting, but I knew if I didn’t go then I would never bite the bullet.

Richard says he plans to keep the weight off by cutting back on beer, saving it for special occasions

'I saw a couple there that I knew and they were a husband and wife team so I wasn’t the only man there and more importantly, everyone was so friendly and welcoming.

'I immediately felt at ease and a sense of relief washed over me knowing that now I have had the courage to take that first step, I could just be successful with this journey.'

Now Richard is back in the Saddleworth Morris Men and looking forward to the new season.

He said: 'I’m going to have to watch my alcohol consumption because the last thing I want is to put the weight back on.

'The plan is to drink a lot more soft drinks and save the drinking for special occasions.
