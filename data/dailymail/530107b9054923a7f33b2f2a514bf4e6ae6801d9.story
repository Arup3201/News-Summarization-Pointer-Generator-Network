It was a moving coming-of age-story, featuring a group of adolescent boys hunting for the body of a missing child.

But in a discovery reminiscent of classic movie Stand by Me, two teenagers dramatically found a human skull at the bottom of their local river.

Christian Thompson and Robbie Cribley, both 13, were paddling their dinghy on the River Coln, in Fairford, Gloucestershire when they made the discovery.

Christian and Robbie said they had become stuck on some trees and got out of the boat to try and dislodge it.

'Robbie said he could see a skull and I was so shocked when I saw it too,' Christian said.

It was in shallow water close to the bank of the River Coln between Cinder Lane and Cutler's field, just a five minute walk from Christian's house.

At first they thought it was an animal skull until they realised what they had found.

The boys have speculated as to where the skull came from, suggesting that someone was kidnapped and left in the river

Christian's mum Marie admits she thought
it was an overactive imagination to start with while dad Steve 
suspected it would be an animal skull.

'We're always finding cows teeth and stuff in the river but I've never know something like this to turn up,' he said. 'The police didn't even believe it when we rang them too.'

Their families are 
still bewildered by the shocking discovery and are keen to know where 
the skull might have come from.

But the 13-year-olds already have their suspicions of what sinister deeds took place.

The scenes are reminiscent of classic coming of age drama Stand By Me. A

'I think someone must have been kidnapped and chucked in the river,' said Christian.

Gloucestershire Police were called to the scene and confirmed this week that the remains were human.

'It's believed that the remains could have been there for many, many years,' a spokesman said. 'A forensic anthropologist has been contacted who will examine the remains and help identify when the individual passed away.'
