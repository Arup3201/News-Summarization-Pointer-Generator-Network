Taunting: Mark Bridger is trying to overturn his life sentence

The killer of April Jones is set to receive up to £170,000 in legal aid, the Mail can reveal.

The disclosure comes as April’s distraught family expressed their horror that Mark Bridger had launched a shameless bid for freedom – which will cost the taxpayer £20,000.

They demanded that Bridger, who abducted and murdered the five-year-old in a case that shocked the nation, be forced to reveal where he hid her body if he is allowed to appeal his whole-life sentence.

He was convicted in May and ordered to die in prison but, after just six months behind bars, he is attempting to overturn his sentence.

April’s family are furious that he has any right to appeal when he so cruelly refuses to reveal where he hid the little girl’s body.

‘I really don’t think he should have any right,’ April’s grandmother Linda Smith said yesterday.

‘If he can’t say what has happened, I don’t see how he can appeal.’

Bridger’s appeal, which was confirmed by the Ministry of Justice yesterday, comes as the Mail reveals he received £150,000 in legal aid while dragging April’s family through the courts.

Even though the killer confessed to her death when he was arrested last October, he claimed it was an accident, forcing April’s parents to endure five weeks of harrowing  evidence at trial.

Coral and Paul Jones said they felt ‘tortured’ as a result.

‘He’s put us through so much. It’s like he’s taunting us, like he wants to show he’s got the upper hand,’ Mrs Jones said.

‘It’s disgusting. He’s in prison where he belongs and he should stay there. He’s just torturing my family with these legal battles.’

Politicians
and campaigners said taxpayers would be ‘disgusted’ to know they had 
funded the monster’s cruel show in court with a six-figure legal aid 
bill.

And with his appeal due at the High Court next month, that amount is set to rise by an estimated £20,000.

April
was abducted on the evening of October 1 last year as she played on her
pink bicycle close to her home on the Bryn-y-Gog estate in Machynlleth,
Mid-Wales.

Former slaughterman Bridger, 48, who kept child porn and 
pictures of dead youngsters on his laptop, lured April into his Land 
Rover and drove her to his remote rented home before brutally sexually 
assaulting her, killing her and disposing of her body.

Months of 
exhaustive police searches failed to find the child’s body. Bridger told
police that he had killed April but has adamantly refused to reveal 
what he did with her body.

Anguish: The victim's parents Coral and Paul Jones have spoken of their anger at hearing the news

April’s blood and 17 fragments of skull 
were later discovered in his house. The tiny pieces of bone are all her 
parents were able to bury at her funeral in September.

Despite his 
confession, Bridger pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, 
subjecting her grieving parents to the horror of a five-week trial.

Represented by top criminal  barrister Brendan Kelly QC, Bridger’s substantial legal costs were funded by the public.

Bridger, a father of six, was  sentenced to die in jail by Mr Justice Griffith Williams at Mold Crown Court.

The judge said he had ‘no doubt there can be only one sentence’, handing him a whole life tariff.

‘The
grief of April’s parents  cannot be over-stated. They lived with the 
torment of a missing daughter... And they have had to endure the 
spectacle of your  hypocritical sympathy for their loss and of your 
tears, flowing not because of any regret for your crimes, but because of
your enduring self pity.’

Jailed: Bridger is one of just 49 people in Britain currently serving whole life sentences

Bridger has now appealed his sentence and, because he is covered by legal aid, his challenge will also be paid for by taxpayers.

Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘It beggars belief that Mark Bridger can claim such a huge sum of  public money.’

Robert
Oxley, from the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: ‘Given the horrendous 
nature of Mark Bridger’s crime, most people will find it disgusting that
they have funded his trial with a six-figure bill.’

Earlier this 
year, Bridger tried to claim compensation following an attack by a 
fellow inmate at the top security Wakefield Prison in West Yorkshire.

In
total, it is believed Bridger’s refusal to accept any responsibility 
for his heinous crimes has cost the public about £9million, including 
£8.5million for the biggest search in the history of British policing.
