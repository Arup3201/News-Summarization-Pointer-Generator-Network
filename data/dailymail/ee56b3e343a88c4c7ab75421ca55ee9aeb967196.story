Homes in London and the rest of the South are worth around £330billion more than the value of properties in all the rest of England, a report revealed yesterday.

The report, from the Halifax bank, highlights the extraordinary gulf in property wealth between families living in the South compared to those in the North.

It also reveals the nightmare facing young people trying to buy a home in the South who do not earn high salaries or do not have parents who can help them out with a deposit.

North-South gulf: Homes in London (such as this elegant house in Kensington) and the rest of the South are wroth around £330billion more than those in all the rest of England

Overall, it found properties in the South are worth a total of £2,000billion, compared to a total of £1,670billion in every other English region combined - from the Midlands to the North.

For example, official figures show the average cost of a home in the North East is just under £100,000.

By comparison, the average price tag of a home in London is £372,000, with thousands of homes selling for more than £1million and some even costing tens of millions each.

It comes after a separate report, from the estate agency Savills, found homes in London’s ten most exclusive boroughs are worth as much as those in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined.

The Savills report looked at the total value of all the homes in boroughs such as Kensington and Chelsea, Richmond upon Thames, Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth and Lambeth.

These homes are worth a total of £552.5billion, compared to a total of £552.7billion in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

wealth is being concentrated in fewer people’s hands.

‘That restricts the ability of some groups, particularly younger generations, to get on to, or trade up, the housing ladder, creating longer-term implications on the lifetime cost of housing.’ 

Savills estimates the value of homes in Elmbridge, a corner of Surrey dubbed the ‘Beverly Hills of Britain’, is higher than the entire value of residential property in Glasgow.

The district council of Elmbridge, which includes towns such as Claygate, Esher, Oxshott and Weybridge, has regularly been voted ‘the most desirable place to live in Britain.’ The Halifax report shows how the value of homes in Britain has ballooned over the last decade despite the double-dip recession and recent steep falls in house prices in many regions.

In 2002, they were worth £2,568billion compared to £4,172billion today, an increase of 62 per cent.

This is the equivalent of a jump of £71,200 for each home which is either owner-occupied or in the privately rented sector.

Martin Ellis, housing economist at the Halifax, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group, said the value of Britain’s private residential homes has risen much faster than the cost of living.

The average home in London ‘earned’ more money last year than a typical worker in Britain with a full-time job, according to the Land Registry.

The cost of the average home in the capital jumped by nearly £29,000, but the average worker earned only £26,000 before paying their tax and National Insurance bill.
