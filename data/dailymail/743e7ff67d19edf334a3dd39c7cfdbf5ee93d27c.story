Nightmare: A senior aide to Ed Miliband (seated) described complained about Ed Balls' failure to stay on message

Labour leader Ed Miliband was today forced to deny thinking his shadow chancellor Ed Balls is a 'nightmare' to work with.

Leaked emails sent reveal how the pair are deeply divided over how to respond to the economic revival.

But Mr Miliband insisted he was ‘proud’ to have Mr Balls by his side as he sought to quell rumours of a damaging rift.

In the emails Mr Miliband's adviser Torsten Bell describes Mr Balls's response to recent optimistic growth, jobs and inflation forecasts from the Bank of England as a ‘nightmare’.

Today Mr Miliband tried to play down the idea of a rift, despite the damning criticism from one of his closest aides.

‘I think it's fair to say that people send silly emails in offices and this was one of them,’ Mr Miliband told ITV’s Daybreak.

‘Ed and I are working really well together. I'm really proud to have him as the shadow chancellor alongside me.

‘He's somebody who I think has been right in this criticism of the Government's economic policy and he's also leading the way on this cost of living crisis that we've been talking about.’

The row threatened to overshadow a major speech by Mr Miliband today on cutting the costs of childcare.

Labour have struggled to find a coherent message in response to the growing economic recovery.

Bank
 of England governor Mark Carney declared: 'For the first time in a long
 time, you don’t have to be an optimist to see the glass as half full. 
The recovery has finally taken hold.'

A
 draft statement circulated by Mr Balls’s senior advisor Alex 
Bellardinelli began: ‘After three damaging years of flatlining . . .’ a 
phrase Mr Miliband now avoids.

Mr Balls went on to complain about the ‘cost-of-living crisis’, called for a ‘recovery that’s built to last’ and an ‘economy that works for working people’.

Forwarding the email to others in the Labour party, Mr Miliban;ds top economic adviser Torsten Bell said it was an ‘an example of why we’re having problems on EB (EdBalls) messaging’.

He signed off with his own damning, one-word assessment of Mr Balls: ‘Nightmare’.

The Tories seized on the revelations as proof Mr Miliband was ‘too weak’ to sack Mr Balls while other Labour frontbenchers were forced to deny the party leadership was split.

Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘With Labour's two most senior figures at each other's throats, they cannot be trusted to run the economy.

‘Miliband never wanted Balls in the post, but if he's too weak to sack his “nightmare” shadow chancellor, then he is too weak to cut the deficit, too weak to fix the welfare system and too weak to stand up for ordinary hard-working people.

‘Once again we're seeing in-fighting between a Labour leader and his shadow chancellor. It really is the same old Labour.’

But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham insisted that the Labour Party and its front bench was more united than it has been in 20 years.

He accused the media of ‘scraping the barrel’ over the emails.
