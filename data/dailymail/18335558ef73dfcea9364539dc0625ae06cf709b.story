Struggling Canadian mobile phone maker Blackberry is suing ‘American Idol’ host Ryan Seacrest over a much-hyped physical keyboard adapter for iPhones.

Typo, the Seacrest-backed startup making the physical keyboard, is being sued because Blackberry feels the keyboard design borrows a little too much inspiration from north of the border - Mr Seacrest is one of Typo's major backers.

‘This is a blatant infringement against BlackBerry’s iconic keyboard, and we will vigorously protect our intellectual property against any company that attempts to copy our unique design,’ Blackberry lawyer Steve Zipperstein said in a statement.

Unoriginal: Ryan Seacrest-backed Typo is being sued by Blackberry for copyright infringement over the design of it's iPhone keyboard cases

The lawsuit filed in San Francisco federal court contends Typo’s keyboard violates Blackberry’s intellectual property rights and seeks unspecified damages.

Blackberry keyboards are what positioned the handhelds as the go-to device for on the go professionals before the iPhone debuted in 2007.

Blackberry stalwarts often lament their touchscreen typing woes when defending their continued use of the antiquated devices despite more feature-rich options being readily available.

The $99 keyboard is actually the bottom half of a case that slides over the back of any iPhone 5 or 5S. It appears to connect to the bottom of the phone, but really works via Bluetooth, wirelessly transmitting keystrokes to the iPhone.

Looks similar: The keyboards do bear a striking resemblance to those made by Blackberry

The keyboard, which bears a striking resemblance to the one found on most recent Blackberry handhelds, is currently available for pre-order on Typo’s website. Shipments are scheduled to begin this month.

Mr Seacrest took such a liking to Typo he invested $1million.

The firm is still smarting from a $4.4billion loss last quarter, and is moving to protect what it may feel is one of the differentiators it has left.

Blackberry’s stock traded at well over $200 per share just before the first iPhone was released, it now trades at around $7 per share.

‘We are flattered by the desire to graft our keyboard onto other smartphones, but we will not tolerate such activity without fair compensation for using our intellectual property and our technological innovations,’ Mr Zipperstein added.

The iconic Blackberry Messenger BBM was 
made available to both Android and Apple devices earlier this year, 
putting another dent in the company’s once impenetrable enterprise 
armor.

Not their first time at the rodeo: Typo isn't the first firm sued by Canadian firm for keyboard copyright infringement, a 2002 suit against Handspring resulted in the company licensing keyboard patents from Blackberry

The company also severed ties with high profile celebrity endorser Alicia Keys earlier this week. She was publicly recognized as Blackberry’s creative director, but it is not clear how she served in that capacity.

Typo did not immediately respond to a MailOnline message left for comment.

A previous suit filed by Blackberry over keyboard patents may signal a possible outcome.

The firm sued Handspring in 2002, The Verge noted. Handspring opted to license the patents and Blackberry dropped its claims.
