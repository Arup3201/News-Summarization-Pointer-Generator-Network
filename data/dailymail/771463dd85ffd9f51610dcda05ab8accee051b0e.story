Jackass star Ryan Dunn was heavily intoxicated at the time of his deadly high speed crash, police revealed today.Â 

The star's blood alcohol level was 0.196, more than twice the legal limit in Pennsylvania, which is 0.08, West Goshen Police Chief Michael Carroll confirmed in a statement released today.

Mr Carroll added that the toxicology report from the Chester County Coroner's Office indicated there were 'no drugs of abuse detected'.

The 34-year-old had been drinking at a bar with friends in the hours before the crash, which also killed his passenger, Zachary Hartwell.

He is said to have drank three beers and taken shots before getting behind the wheel shortly after 2am on Monday morning.
