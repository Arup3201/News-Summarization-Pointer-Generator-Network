A married couple have been trampled to death by an elephant at an Indian wildlife reserve after the flash of their camera caused it to charge at them.

The pair were part of a group of eight that had were on a two-hour trekking expedition organised by the state forest department in Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala.

According to reports, the couple had tried to take a picture of a herd of elephants, with the flash of the camera provoking the animals.

The couple had been trying to take pictures of a herd of elephants at the Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala, pictured, when they trampled by one of the animals 

It is thought that one elephant then began to charge at the husband and wife, who were trampled and  died on the spot.

The couple, from Gujrat, have been named as Bhupendra Raval, aged 52, who works as a general  manager in a private firm and his 50-year-old scientist wife Jagruthy.

A forest official told the Times of India: 'The couple did not have time to move from the elephant's path as it ran straight into them in a mad frenzy.'

A guide leading the trip was also hurt in the stampede.

The tiger reserve is popular with tourists and the town of Gavi, where the reserve is located, attracts more than 1,000 visitors a day during the peak tourist season.

Many people go to the area to see the town's large elephant population.

It is thought that the herd of elephants were spooked by the flash from the couple's camera, which provoked one of them to charge the couple (file picture)  

But officials have been concerned that the increase in visitors may be reducing the wildlife there and may restrict the number of tourists.

V K Venkatchalam from the Elephant Task Force said: 'Trekking trails should be banned and people should be taken only for Safari rides in grilled vehicles.

'The elephants may turn violent especially if they are in musth.'

According to the latest figures, in 2013/14, 19 people, mostly from tribal areas around the forest in Kerala, were killed after being trampled by wild elephants.
