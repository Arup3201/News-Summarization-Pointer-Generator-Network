These are the stunning images of one photographer's mission to shoot the world's last remaining pure ocean.

The Ross Sea in Antarctica has been considered by many to be the world's only body of water not altered or damaged by humans.

The breath-taking pictures were captured by photographer John Weller, from Boulder in Colorado, USA.

He shot the set over four trips to the Antarctic, all prior to 2009, which have just been turned into a new book called 'The Last Ocean: Saving the Most Pristine Ecosystem on Earth.'

The project, which included shots of Emperor and Adelie penguins, silverfish, seals, and minke whales, was supported as one of the Pew Research Center's Environmental Initiatives.

Prior to his voyages, John helped set up the Last Ocean Organisation in 2004, joining scientists and environmental groups in a campaign to have the entire Ross Sea designated as an international marine protected area - it is yet to be declared so.

That
 was until commercial fishing discovered it. Now that fishery removes 
3,000 tons of fish annually, threatening to destroy the world's last 
intact ecosystem.

John,
 a critically acclaimed photographer, writer and filmmaker, said: 'Each 
photograph for me is a cherished memory - they are meant as both a 
celebration and a directive.

'The Ross Sea is fantastical, and I hoped to capture some of the humbling beauty. Every creature that I encountered in the Antarctic demanded my immediate and complete attention and respect.

'The Ross Sea is the last large, intact marine ecosystem left on Earth, illuminating the devastating assessment by the United States National Science Foundation.

'A more sobering discovery is that little if any of the ocean remains unaffected by fisheries, agricultural runoff, sewage, aqua culture and industry.

'The scariest estimates are that we've eaten our way through 90% of the world's top predatory fishes - tunas, groupers and sharks - since 1950. The most optimistic estimates aren't much better.'
