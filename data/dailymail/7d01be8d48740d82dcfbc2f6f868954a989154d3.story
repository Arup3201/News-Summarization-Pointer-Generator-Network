Yaya Toure has opened up on a turbulent summer in which he threatened to quit Manchester City for failing to celebrate his 31st birthday and then attacked the club for not giving him compassionate leave to visit his cancer-stricken brother.

The Ivory Coast star stopped short of saying sorry for the bizarre outbursts over City’s end-of-season trip to Abu Dhabi, but promised to stay at the Etihad ‘for as long as possible’ and try to win over supporters by lifting more trophies this season.

Toure and his agent Dimitry Seluk stunned City in May by accusing the new Premier League champions of treating him like ‘a nobody’ at a title celebration attended by owner Sheikh Mansour.

They warned that the birthday snub could force him to consider a return to Barcelona just a year after signing a new long-term contract worth £230,000-a-week, although it later transpired that City had presented him with not one but two birthday cakes.

Speaking on the club’s pre-season tour of America, Toure said: ‘It was not a case of me wanting to leave the club. I stayed quiet and at the end of the day it’s my decision. I will stay at Manchester City for as long as possible.

‘The matter is closed now. The most important thing was to try to focus again. Now I’m very happy to join the team and the manager. Everyone is very positive.

‘This year is going to be fantastic. We’ve got some fantastic players coming in and important players are staying. If you want to be the best you need to win every trophy possible, and the Champions League is a target this year.

‘We know we are the team to beat. This year will be amazing because I’m expecting something – I’m expecting trophies this year.’

Toure launched a second outspoken attack on City last month, claiming that the Abu Dhabi trip had denied him valuable time at the bedside of his sick brother Ibrahim. Club sources later insisted that they would never turn down requests from players for compassionate leave.

The 28-year-old died in a Manchester hospital during the World Cup after urging his elder brother to go to Brazil with the Ivory Coast squad.

‘He has been sick for two years,’ added Toure. ‘But he knew I loved football and he was telling me, 'go to the World Cup and enjoy it. If you stay with me and don’t participate in the World Cup I would not be happy. I would love to see you doing your best and trying to help the country'.

‘He loved football. When he was sick in Manchester he was watching every game I was playing in. After them I was coming to see him in hospital.

‘With the loss of my brother it was quite hard. I’m a Muslim, I believe in God. Sometimes you can have everything, but this was a difficult situation.

‘Unfortunately it was a difficult summer for my family. When you lose a brother it is always difficult and he was young too. We were very sad, all the family. We need to move on and pray for him.'
