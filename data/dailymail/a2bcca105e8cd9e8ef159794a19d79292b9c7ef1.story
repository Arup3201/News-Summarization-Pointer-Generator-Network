Loretta Lynch is promising a fresh relationship with law enforcement – and with Congress – as she appears before a Senate committee Wednesday in her bid to become the nation's first female black attorney general.

But she has serious hurdles in front of her as the Senate Judiciary Committee, now under Republican control, warns about 'a Department of Justice that is deeply politicized' under the outgoing AG, Eric Holder.

Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee's chairman, said in his opening statement that America's next top law enforcer would need to worry about 'restoring respect for the co-equal branches of government.'

In the first confirmation hearing under the GOP-led Senate, Lynch appeared Wednesday for the first of two days of hearings on her nomination. She's widely expected to win confirmation but faces tough questions from a GOP that's flexing its post-election muscles.

Grassley said in Wednesday's hearing that 'the Attorney General’s job is to represent the American People – not just the president and not just the executive branch.'

Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch faces the first confirmation hearing under the new Republican Senate. Her nomination raised eyebrows when it emerged that she once co-founded a college sorority with the future wife of the outgoing AG, Eric Holder

That was a jab at the Oval Office and President Barack Obama's recent expansion of its power with executive action on immigration and other hot-button issues. 

Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, from Lynch's home state of New York, introduced her at the tense Capitol Hill hearing by warning that 'the president's immigration policies aren't seeking confirmation today. Loretta Lynch is.'

'If we can't confirm Loretta Lynch, we can't confirm anyone,' Schumer said.

Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, the committee's ranking Democrat, used his moment in the spotlight on Wednesday to warn that Lynch will need to deal with the Bureau of Prisons as it bulges with convicts placed behind bars because of mandatory-minimum sentences that he said don't make America safer. 

He also condemned 'dragnet surveillance programs directed at American citizens' and looked ahead to June when three sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are set to expire. 

'We must protect our national security and our civil liberties,' Leahy said.

Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, expects to replace Eric Holder, who announced his resignation last fall after leading the Justice Department for six years. 

Holder has been a lightning rod for conservative criticism, clashing with Republicans and becoming the first sitting attorney general held in contempt of Congress

Lynch introduced her husband to the committee on Wednesday, whom she said has 'supported me in all my endeavors, no matter how poor they make us.'

In prepared testimony, she pledged better relations with Capitol Hill.

'I look forward to fostering a new and improved relationship with this committee, the United States Senate, and the entire United States Congress – a relationship based on mutual respect and constitutional balance,' Lynch said.

Holder also battled the perception from critics that he aligned himself more with protesters of police violence than with members of law enforcement, a charge he and the Justice Department have strongly denied – but one that resonated in the aftermath of high-profile deaths of black men at the hands of white police officers.

In her prepared testimony, Lynch promised a fresh start in that relationship, too.

'Few things have pained me more than the recent reports of tension and division between law enforcement and the communities we serve,' Lynch said, pledging to 'work to strengthen the vital relationships' if confirmed.

But her ties to Holder have raised concerns among Republicans.

At Harvard University in 1980, Lynch co-founded a chapter of the all-black Delta Sigma Theta sorority along with Sharon Malone and nine other college co-eds. 

Malone is now Holder's wife. 

Lynch already has earned praise from several GOP senators for her credentials and accomplishments, though. 

She still face tough questions from Republicans who now control the Senate.

The hearing gives them an opportunity to press their opposition to Obama administration policies while showcasing their own governing roles as the 2016 presidential election cycle gets underway.

'She certainly has the credentials. We don't want a repeat of what we had,' said Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, a senior committee member. 'I look upon her as a pretty good appointment, but I have to listen along with everybody else.'

Loretta Lynch, poised to become the first black woman to serve as America's attorney general, has been the top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York since 2010

The Judiciary Committee includes some of the Senate's most outspoken Republicans, among them Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a potential presidential candidate who promised to quiz Lynch on Obama's executive actions on immigration that granted reprieves from deportation to millions.

'We need an attorney general who will stop being a partisan attack dog and instead get back to the traditions of upholding the Constitution and the law in a fair and impartial manner,' Cruz said.

Lynch's hearing comes amid a nationwide spotlight on police tactics in the wake of deaths of black men at the hands of white police officers, as well as the slaying last month of two officers in New York City. It's an issue Lynch, 55, is deeply familiar with.

She helped prosecute the New York City police officers who severely beat and sexually assaulted Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997.

Her office in New York is currently leading a civil rights investigation into the police chokehold death of Eric Garner in Staten Island last summer.

Lynch has been the top prosecutor since 2010 for a district that includes Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island, a role she also held from 1999 to 2001.

On a conference call Tuesday, law enforcement officials praised Lynch's nomination. 

New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton described her as a 'fair-minded individual' who would be able to navigate sensitive matters of race relations and policing and see both sides.

Lynch grew up with humble beginnings in North Carolina, the daughter of a school librarian and a Baptist minister. 

She went on to receive undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard University. 

'I believe in the promise of America because I have lived the promise of America,' she said in her prepared testimony.
