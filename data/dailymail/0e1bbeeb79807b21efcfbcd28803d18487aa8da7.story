The United Arab Emirates have been suspended by the International Equestrian Federation  indefinitely over horse welfare and rule infringements in endurance events.

Under the ban UAE riders will not be allowed to compete for their country in any international events, although they will be allowed to compete under an FEI flag in non-endurance disciplines outside of the Emirates.

There has been growing concern over the treatment of endurance horses in the UAE and the world body recently stepped in to remove two endurance events in UAE from the winter season.

Three horses were reported dead at the 74-mile Al Reef Cup in Abu Dhabi on February 1 and one, Splitters Creek Bundy, appeared to have broken both front legs.

FEI president Ingmar de Vos said the FIA's Bureau had been unanimous in suspending the UAE federation.

'The decision to suspend a National Federation is not something that is taken lightly and we only should do this if no other remedy can be found,' he said in a statement.

'Sadly this was the only option left, but we have to take our responsibility and must never be afraid of tackling major issues head-on. Where horse welfare is concerned the FEI has to show leadership and solve problems in a structural way without making any concessions.'

De Vos said the FEI had hoped strict enforcement of new rules brought in on August 1 last year would reduce the numbers of 'catastrophic injuries' and fatalities in the UAE.

The statement was quite devastating. The International Equestrian Federation had removed the two remaining International Endurance events scheduled to be held in the United Arab Emirates in an emergency measure to protect horse welfare and preserve integrity. 

Put bluntly: some of the most respected horsemen in the world can’t be trusted to look after horses.

Within days, Endurance Great Britain dropped a proposed blanket sponsorship from the Meydan Corporation, owned by Sheik Mohammed Al Maktoum, citing national and international pressures and sensitivities. 

With this scandal mounting for close on two years, it is incredible and embarrassing that Meydan got through the door, no matter how much money was at stake.

'Regretfully this has not been the case,' he added. 'In the end we had no other choice than taking this drastic measure to deal with an unacceptable situation.'

Endurance races in the Middle East can be brutal with distances of 100 miles a day, covered at high speed, common.

Allegations of horse identity fraud have also been investigated by the FEI, according to the paper.

The World Horse Welfare welcomed the move, Chief Executive Roly Owers said: 'In many ways this is a sad day. However the FEI’s drastic move to suspend the UAE federation is a reflection of the seriousness of the situation within endurance.

'While we are disappointed that it has come to this, this action had to be taken for the welfare of the horses and the integrity of the sport.'

The ban could raise doubts over Dubai's suitability to host the world championships in 2016 wih the Swiss and Belgium equestrian federations threatening a boycott.

The UAE Federation' place in the next year's Summer Olympics in Brazil could also be in jeopardy.

It has 30 days to appeal against the suspension.
