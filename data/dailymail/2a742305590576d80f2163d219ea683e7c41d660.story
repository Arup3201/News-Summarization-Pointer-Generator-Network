We might have a reputation for being more restrained than our transatlantic counterparts.

But a new study has revealed that far from being buttoned-up, Britons are more than twice as likely as Americans to sleep naked.

When asked about their bedroom attire, 30 per cent of Brits admitted to nodding off in the nude – compared with 12 per cent of respondents from the US and just 9 per cent of Germans.

In bed: Britons are more likely to sleep naked than citizens of many other countries, new research reveals

The International Bedroom Poll, published by the US National Sleep Foundation, studied the nighttime rituals of people from across the globe.

They also found 7 per cent of us go to sleep with socks on – compared with 16 per cent of people in America and 19 per cent of Canadians.

The poll also looked into bedroom hygiene, where it was discovered that 55 per cent of British people change their sheets once a week.

This makes us over three times cleaner in the bedroom than the Germans, where just 18 per cent change their sheets every seven days.

Perhaps this is an attempt to block unpleasant smells because 91 per cent of us claim bad body odour - either their partner’s or their own - distracts them from trying to sleep.

Professor Jay Born, who specialises in behavioural neuroscience, said: ‘It is important to look at cultural differences in sleep.

'This shows intriguing cultural variations on how we tackle this nightly biological ritual.’

David Cloud, National Sleep Foundation CEO, said: 'No matter what your nationality, you will spend about a third of your life in bed.'

Bizarrely, 13 per cent of us sleep with our blinds and curtains open, while one in ten sleep with a pet.

Additionally, one in five Brits use three or more pillows - while only three per cent of people in Japan do the same.

In fact, just 44 per cent of Japanese people make their bed every day, which is just over half that of the UK (80 per cent).
