A South African court has found black farmhand Chris Mahlangu guilty of murdering Eugene Terre’Blanche, a white supremacist prominent during the dying years of apartheid, in a wage dispute.            

A second man, who was a minor at the time of the April 2010 murder, was found guilty of housebreaking in Ventersdorp, a farming community about 80 miles west of Johannesburg where Terre’Blanche owned a farm.

The case has served as a reminder of the bitter historical divisions in a country now dubbed the 'Rainbow Nation' and ruled by the African National Congress, the party that helped end apartheid in 1994.

Many see Terre’Blanche as a relic from a bygone era, with his murder doing little to stir fresh racial tension.     

'After all the evidence given, I conclude that accused number one is guilty as charged,' said Judge John Horn.

Prosecutors said Mahlangu and his co-accused broke into Terre’Blanche’s home, where they found the 71-year-old asleep and bludgeoned him to death with an axe.   

Terre’Blanche, a burly man known for his thick white beard and fiery rhetoric, led the hardline supremacist Afrikaner Resistance Movement.               

Its members adopted military uniforms and flags with a symbol reminiscent of the Nazi swastika, and called for an all-white homeland in the post-apartheid South Africa.

A small group of his armed supporters attempted a coup in the black-run “homeland” of Bophuthatswana shortly before the first all-race elections in April 1994 but retreated after meeting resistance from security forces.

Graphic images of three AWB men being shot dead at point blank range in the middle of a road by a Bophuthatswana policeman marked the end of any AWB pretensions to be a serious military force.
