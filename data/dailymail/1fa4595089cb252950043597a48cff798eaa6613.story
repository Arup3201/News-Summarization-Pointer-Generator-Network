A headteacher who expelled a six-year-old boy after he brought in Mini Cheddars for his packed lunch fed pupils food from McDonald’s, it was revealed today.

Jeremy Meek ordered the notorious junk food for youngsters at Colnbrook Church of England Primary School in Berkshire, just weeks before kicking out a pupil in a row over healthy eating.

Pupil Riley Pearson was expelled earlier this month following the fall-out over his lunchbox. His four-year-old brother Jayden also had his place at the pre-school withdrawn by the headteacher.

But it has now emerged that the school bought around 100 children McDonald’s meals for lunch after a break-in at the school at the end of the Christmas term had left the canteen out of action.

Riley’s father Tom Pearson said: ‘It is just so hypocritical and makes me really angry at their double standards. There were five dinner ladies working.

‘Why didn’t they go to the shop a few minutes’ away, get some bread and make some sandwiches if they are so concerned about healthy eating? McDonald’s is junk food, pure and simple.

‘The headteacher is happy to feed kids with fast food - (but) kicks Riley out for having Mini Cheddars. The way Riley, Jayden and my family have been treated is a complete disgrace.’

However, Mr Meek responded by saying: ‘The school was broken into last year and as a result we were unable to use the school kitchen that day.

‘We were faced with trying to source approximately 100 hot lunches for our pupils at very short notice. The school opted for fish finger meals from McDonald's.

‘This was before the introduction of our healthy eating policy in January and avoided the pupils not being provided with any kind of meal.’

Mr Pearson and Riley’s mother Natalie 
Mardle, who is pregnant, have started a petition calling for the 
youngsters to be reinstated at the school. It has so far attracted 
around 1,500 signatures.

The parents argue that the school has no right to dictate to them what they should feed their children, and also maintain that Riley is a healthy weight for his age.

They insist they sent him to school every day with a balanced lunch of orange squash or water, a sandwich, an apple or banana and cream cheese dunkers or Mini Cheddars.

The school introduced a healthy eating policy at the start of term with a letter to parents outlining that chocolate, sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks were not allowed.

It added: ‘It your child’s lunchbox is unhealthy and unbalance they will be provided with a school lunch for which you will be charged.’

Mr Meek said Riley’s parents were repeatedly warned about the contents of his lunch box, including at a face to face meeting.

Riley was excluded for four days before being told he was not allowed to return to his classmates.

A statement from the school said: ‘We 
have not excluded a pupil for just having mini cheddars in their 
lunchbox, but where there is a persistent and deliberate breach of 
school policy, such as bringing in crisps, biscuits, sausage rolls, mini
 sausages, scotch eggs and similar, and all other avenues have been 
exhausted, the Governors would expect further action to be taken.

‘If we are faced with a situation where a parent threatens to send a pupil into school with insufficient food to sustain them throughout the school day, it is a risk we simply cannot afford to happen.’

It added that the decision to permanently exclude a pupil was taken due to persistent breaches of school policies and a pupil’s parents making it publically clear that their child would not follow the policy.

The school said the parent-school relationship suffered an ‘irretrievable breakdown’ that would put the two pupils in an unacceptable position.

It added: ‘This breakdown was due to misrepresentations in the local and national media that were both wholly inaccurate and grossly misleading, abusive language being used towards staff, and other inappropriate actions being taken that were designed to damage the school’s reputation.’
