A handsome Frenchman is running his fingers through my hair, whispering in an accent as fruity and seductive as champagne.

I am melting, nearly purring with pleasure and anticipation, as his fingers, which know me so well, seem to caress my very soul.

This man instinctively knows when I’m having a bad day, and how to turn it into a good one. He can tease a smile out of me where all else has failed. He even knows how - and when - I like my coffee, without even asking.

Special bond: Jenni Murray has become best of friends with her hairdresser Olivier Morosini

But this is not my lover, nor even my husband of 33 years. This is my hairdresser, Olivier Morosini. We have a relationship like no other.

Nothing could have surprised me less than the discovery that it's not unusual these days for a woman to have a longer relationship with her hairdresser than she does with her husband.

A survey this week revealed that a woman spends an average of 12 years with her hair stylist and a mere 11 with her partner.

And, for me, leaving Olivier would feel like a betrayal or bereavement. I honestly see us growing old together.

A friend recommended him to me when Frances, my hairdresser for the previous five years, went through a disastrous divorce and disappeared.

Olivier was in his mid-30s when we met and I was in my late 40s. I don't know whether it was his natural Gallic charm or if hairdressers, gay or straight (he's straight by the way), just know how to make a woman feel marvellous. But this handsome, casually dressed, dark stunner and I got off on exactly the right foot.

'Every six weeks, I go along for a colour 
and cut and engaging conversation. We've learned a lot about each other 
during the hours we have spent together'

He sat me down, ran his fingers expertly through my hair, declared it thick and beautiful (exactly the right thing to say), discussed what kind of style I wanted and what he thought would suit me, and our relationship began.

At the end of that first visit, in a tiny basement in the middle of Manchester, decorated in a slightly baroque style - a kind of mini-Versailles - I knew I had found someone I could trust implicitly with my hair and, as time went on, with worries and concerns that I knew would never be passed on.

So, every six weeks, I go along for a colour and cut and engaging conversation. We've learned a lot about each other during the hours we have spent together. We shared concerns about our ageing parents - mine across the Pennines, his on the outskirts of Paris.

We talked about politics in our respective countries, discussed interesting documentaries we’d seen or books we'd read. His favourite author is Aldous Huxley and he's way ahead of me on that one.

It's the kind of ever-fresh discussion you'd hope for on a wonderful date - but without the stress and wretchedness of adultery.

Set for life: It's not unusual these days for a woman to have a longer relationship with her hairdresser than she does with her husband (posed by models)

He's even worked his magic on my son Charlie when I took him for a haircut as a teenager.

A Francophile like me, when he chose to study French at A-level and then University, Olivier became invaluable for oral practice.

Charlie now lives in London, but still takes time to journey north when he needs a cut. I’ve no idea what language they converse in - I hope it's French.

I do like to give Olivier a taste of home with a bit of the old Francais. I greet him with a 'Bonjour!' And he me with a 'Bonjour Mme Jenni' and a hug. He’s even been known to peck me on both cheeks - very French. There aren't many guys who would dare, let alone get away with it. It makes me swoon every time.

He now calls me Dame Jenni and was quite unaccountably proud when I was awarded the honour two years ago. We have never discussed holidays - supposedly the classic hairdresser/client conversation - except when, two years ago, I took my family to New Zealand for the Rugby World Cup and, even then, only after my return.

'When life got really tough seven or eight
 years ago, it became clear what we had was a friendship, not just a 
business arrangement'

It's true, I think, that no matter how long you've lived in a foreign country, it's still your homeland you support. Olivier was so disappointed that France lost in the final and I was too ashamed to discuss England's parlous performance.

Over the years, it's become a less flirtatious relationship, although he still makes the effort to make me feel special every time I walk through the door.

When life got really tough seven or eight years ago, it became clear what we had was a friendship, not just a business arrangement. It was one of the worst times of my life: my parents died, I had breast cancer, chemotherapy and lost my hair. Olivier could not have been more supportive. He still managed to make me feel like an appreciated and attractive woman despite the opposite being obviously the case.

And he was able to flatter and pamper when everyone else to whom I'm close was too terrified by the possible impact of the disease to think of anything apart from my survival . . . or otherwise.

As the hair began to suffer from the chemo, he cut it shorter and shorter, trying to keep some element of style, until it got so bad I called and said I wouldn't be coming for a while, as I'd had it all shaved off at home. He reassured me it would grow back thicker and bouncier than ever and he'd be waiting to make me look wonderful again.

I missed my regular trips to the salon and the relaxing pampering I always get there.

Then, as the hair began to recover, the first question I asked my oncologist was: 'How soon can I get this horrible iron grey dyed?'

I hadn't seen my natural colour for a good 20 years and hated it as it grew back.

The other man: Jenni felt guilty when she went to see hairdresser Daniel Galvin

'Just get your hairdresser to give it a test in case you've become sensitive to the dye,' he said, to my relief. 'It should be OK now.'

What a pleasure it was to go back to Olivier. Walking into the salon felt like an enormous step in my recovery. Now I could begin to look like myself again and we could get back to our regular routine of colour, cut and conversation.

Slowly, over the years, as we've both grown older, we've shared our troubles. He doesn't have quite as much hair as he used to and his back has caused him endless difficulties - no joke when you're on your feet all day.

But still he manages to smile and touch my hair with a sensuous stroke that's all too rare when you're not as young as you were.

So now we’re not discussing the aches and pains of ageing parents any more, but sympathising with each other’s.

There has, though, in recent weeks been a bit of a hiccup. The course of true love never did run smooth and I fear I have been unfaithful - cheating on Olivier with another stylist.

You may remember the article I wrote about going grey. I was sent to the London hairdresser, Daniel Galvin, to get the colour done.

Women aged 75 and over visit hairdressers more often than any other age group

While I was sitting in the chair, waiting for a blow dry, a familiar voice cried from across the enormous room - it was Frances - the disappeared divorcee. She's still cutting, but in the Galvin salon.

It was a glorious reunion, and we spent ages catching up and exchanging news. She couldn't resist getting out her scissors and giving me a quick, impromptu trim.

As she snipped away, I had an awful sense of infidelity and I dreaded her making any comment about Olivier's cut - she didn’t.

So, I've agonised over my divided loyalties. Guiltily, I have been back to Frances for a cut, and felt dreadful when Olivier's partner Karen called recently to ask when I'd next be in. I've made an appointment for the weekend after next.

I called Olivier to discuss the colour question. I've been grey for some time now, but would I want the old brunette with highlights? I explained I'd become quite attached to the grey, on account of everybody saying it was totally on trend, but would like it to be an elegant silver.

'Ah, oui,' he said, 'Like Christine Lagarde! So French!'

He will, I know, get my hair just right and there was so much relief on both sides in our conversation when I confessed my betrayal.

'I am so glad you 'ave called,' he said. 'Karen has been shouting at me. Where is Jenni? What 'ave you done to upset 'er? Now I can explain everysing to 'er.'

I'm so glad I called, too. When it comes to hairdressing, when you get a good 'un, you don’t let him go! That's generally what they say about husbands, but it applies equally to a good hairdresser, the one person who, no matter how awful you feel when you meet, will always make you feel better.

So, there's just two weeks to go until my reconciliation with the true love of my life - my hairdresser.

And I think I'll love him all the more for accepting me back after such treachery.
