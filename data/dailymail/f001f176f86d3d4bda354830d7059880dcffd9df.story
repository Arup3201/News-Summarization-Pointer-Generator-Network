Not many people could drag us out of bed on a Sunday morning when it is -8C (18F) outside.

But, true to form, Victoria Beckham drew a stellar crowd at her New York Fashion Week show today including Rachel Zoe, Anna Wintour and proud husband David, who sat front row next to the Vogue editor-in-chief with their sons Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and daughter Harper, three.

The designer, 40, seemed to have the frosty weather in mind with this fall/winter 2015 collection. Knits were the order of the day with slinky midi-length dresses  opening the show.

Pale and interesting: The neutral palette, which included plenty of cream and taupe, showed just how luxurious winter white can look

In a sophisticated neutral palette of cream, taupe, black and navy (save a splash of orange and mustard yellow), the collection evolved into a dream winter wardrobe. Drapey cream skirts, sweaters designed to hang 'just so', and calf-scraping culottes.

In fact, the latter contributed to a touch of what we can only describe as Borrowers-chic, in the oversized proportions of the coats and jumbo buttons on the dresses - though clever tailoring kept silhouettes elegant.

But, says Mrs Beckham in her show notes, 'it is not about one theme - but instead thinking about what women really want to wear and how they want their clothes to make them feel.'

The shoes are certainly 'what women really want to wear.' Following her footwear debut last season, these were designed by Mrs Beckham too. The calf-length boots came in black and beige and had substantial heels in which one could actually envisage stomping around New York. 

Bright ideas: A pair of mustard yellow culottes and a vibrant orange coat were the designer's only concessions to bold colour

Though bags are an important category for Mrs Beckham's brand, there was less focus on them than in seasons past. We did see a few tiny boxy styles, almost small enough to fit in the palm of a model's hand, and one sleek, minimal foldover number.

The creative process for this collection, Mrs Beckham says in her notes, was a little different from usual.

'I began with the dress and looked at evolving and translating it,' she wrote. 'It was from here that the collection and its narrative developed and it has been liberating and surprising for me in terms of the creative process.

'Familiar shapes have been deconstructed and reworked. Volumes have been subverted, menswear elements re-engineered to fit the female form and twists, spirals, seams and asymmetry interplayed. Fabrics bounce and move, a swing is sculptural, and a more body conscious silhouette emerges...

'For me it is a collection full of possibilities.'  

Flower power: The final looks included asymmetric skirts seemingly assembled of iridescent petals

Future perfect: In a sophisticated neutral palette of cream, taupe, black and navy, the collection evolved into a dream winter wardrobe

Take a bow: The designer was greeted by applause when she stepped out from backstage after the show

Family affair: Mrs Beckham's husband, David, sat front row next to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. Daughter Harper, three, sat on his lap, and sons Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12 and Cruz, nine, to his right. Ms Wintour was joined by her daughter, Bee Shaffer (pictured far right)

ALSO AT NEW YORK FASHION WEEK...

Victoria Beckham wasn't the only London-based designer to show at New York Fashion Week this weekend.

Isa Arfen's creative director Serafina Sama, who is originally from Ravenna, Italy, presented a beautiful fall/winter 2015 collection inspired by Italian Vogue fashion spreads from the Nineties and late Seventies glamour at Milk Studios in downtown Manhattan.

Instead of a runway show, however, models posed on boxes covered in large sheets of canvas fabric, like an exquisite painting brought to life.

A velvet-looking maroon corduroy suit worn with a lacy green shirt sparked nostalgia for the Seventies, while sophisticated evening looks - a black midlength tube skirt decorated with sequined fringe detail at the hem (like the bottom of a delicate chandelier) and a slinky pink satin slip dress with a knotted bow on the waist - recalled Nineties glamour. The exotic dark plum lipstick also helped.
