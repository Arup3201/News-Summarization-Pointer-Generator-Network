An elderly couple have adopted ten wild black bears after their temporary shelter was closed down.

Ivan and Lubov Leshchenko keep four female and six male white-chested Asian bears aged four to seven in the back garden of their home in the village of Dubovy Klyuch, East Russia.

A temporary shelter opened nearby in 1995 that cared for animals who were injured and babies whose mothers had been killed by poachers.

The elderly couple have been caring for bears since 2005 but are now struggling to cope with the responsibility

Lubov feeding one of ten bears aged between four and seven that she and her husband house.

But when it was shut down ten years later Ivan and Lyubov offered to care for the bears using their own savings and private donations.

Now that Ivan, 79, is too ill to perform the daily tasks required in caring for the wild animals, the responsibility is left to his elderly wife.

The Siberian Times have reported that journalists from local radio station Lemma in Vladivostok, East Russia, have been attempting to raise funds to help the couple care for the bears.

Lubov said: 'My husband is 79 years old, he was sick for a year and cannot speak now. I take care of the bears myself.’

Local businesses try and help by bringing leftover food, but the couple cannot continue to care for the bears safely

The white chested Asian black bears are wild animals and require a huge amount of attention that the couple are incapable of giving

A local radio station is now attempting to raise money to help the couple provide for the bears

Locals have been attempting to find re-home the bears, while a coffee shop near the farm brings leftover bread to help feed them, but this is not enough. 

The couple are struggling to maintain the farm with just the money from their pensions.

Lubov added: 'Our problem is not solved. Now it's cold, there's a lot of snow, and we do not have time to clean it, so visitors do not come to see the bears, which means there is less food for them.’
