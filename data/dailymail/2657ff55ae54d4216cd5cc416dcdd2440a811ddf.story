Fined: Wolfgang Menzel, pictured outside court today, had to pay the court £500 for trying to sell £23,000 of tickets

A foreign ticket tout who tried to sell £23,000 worth of Olympic tickets on the streets of London has escaped with a paltry fine.

Wolfgang Menzel, 57, was arrested when police spotted him brazenly selling tickets for the opening ceremony for £1,100 each at Westfield Shopping Centre, just next to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford.

Yesterday the German, who had 51 tickets worth £23,900, was fined just £435 after convincing magistrates he was a ‘genuine sports fan’ who had bought too many tickets. But afterwards, the tout told the Daily Mail he had also made bumper profits hawking 2010 World Cup tickets in South Africa.

Several suspected overseas sellers appeared in court yesterday as concerns grow that prized tickets entrusted to foreign delegations are being openly sold on the black market. Scotland Yard has made 29 arrests.

Stratford Magistrates Court heard yesterday that Menzel, a mortgage broker, was caught hours before the opening ceremony on Friday trying to sell 31 tickets to various Olympics events after buying them in his native country. A further 20 were seized from the room where he was staying in Bloomsbury.

Menzel told police he had been trying to sell four tickets for the opening ceremony because his friend and family members couldn’t attend.

Sabrina Samaroo, prosecuting, said Menzel was stopped by police after being seen approaching a man holding a sign that read ‘two tickets needed’.

She added: ‘He said he was selling them for £1,100 each. He said he was planning to sell other tickets because he had spent 30,000 euros on tickets.’

But Nicole Lody, defending, said Menzel was a ‘genuine sports fan’ who planned to attend many events, but got carried away and bought too many tickets.

The maximum penalty for ticket touting at the London Games is a fine of £20,000. But Menzel escaped with a £435 fine after admitting the charge.

Tout: Wolfgang Menzel was caught outside the Olympic Stadium trying to sell tickets to the opening ceremony for more than £1,000

A Canadian tourist caught red-handed trying to sell Olympics tennis tickets for face value walked free from court today despite pleading guilty to ticket touting.

Kenneth Gaba, 38, was caught by police touting the two tickets for the tennis in Wimbledon, south west London, on Saturday.

Officers became suspicious when they saw Gaba, who was on holiday in London from Vancouver, carrying a newspaper strangely.

Having followed him to a bus stop they saw another man give him £100 for the two tickets and swooped to arrest him.

The Canadian said he was only trying to get the money back for the tickets he had bought legitimately as he had lost his pal and didn’t want to watch the tennis on his own.

Gaba, who spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth, pleaded guilty to selling Olympics tickets without authority when he appeared before Lavender Hill Magistrates Court in south London today.

However, District Judge Ken Grant accepted Gaba's version of events.

Ms Samaroo said: 'The defendant was seen to approach the male holding the sign and they had a conversation.

'As officers approached they heard the male saying: "that’s much too expensive".

'They also heard another man say: "do you have another two?"

'He walked away and was followed by another two males and it became obvious to the officers he was attempting to sell tickets.'

The court was told that when interviewed by police, he admitted trying to sell four sought-after tickets for the ceremony. 

Ms Samaroo said: 'In his interview he made admissions. 

'He said he was selling the tickets because his family couldn’t attend. He said he was selling them for £1,100 each.

'He said he was planning to sell other tickets because he had spent 30,000 euros on tickets.'

Nicole Lody, in mitigation, told the court Menzel bought too many tickets.

She said: 'He wasn’t aware that he couldn’t sell them in the UK because in Germany tickets are being advertised very widely on the internet and ebay.

'He has suffered a significant loss - all his tickets have been seized.

'He is not going to the Olympic Games and that money is lost. He is clearly very remorseful and embarrassed that he is in court today.'

Fining Menzel District Judge Mark Radway said: 'It is accepted that these were genuine tickets and it is not challenged that you didn’t know you were not entitled to re-sell them in the UK.

'Taking into account the fact that you have lost the value of these tickets and you have pleaded guilty, the fine is going to be based on one week’s wages.'

Menzel's fine came as spectators who fail to take their 
seats within 30 minutes of the start of an Olympic event were warned they could lose them
under plans being considered by Games organisers.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said today the new rule was being explored after many events began in half-empty stadia.

Organisers
Locog have already drafted in troops, teachers and schoolchildren to 
sit in empty seats in a desperate bid to fill venues.

Some 3,000 Olympics tickets have been taken from international sporting 
federations and put 'back in the pot' to be bought by members of 
the public.

Problems: The Games has been plagued by empty seats at events but Menzel is one of several touting tickets because they have too many

Announcement: Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt says that people who are not in their seats within 30 minutes of the events starting could forfeit their tickets

An Olympic Games employee charged over a ticket scam involving the 
theft of media passes to travel in VIP Games lanes through London appeared in court today.

Canadian Alkyiham Sachedina, 29, an international logistics 
specialist who came to the UK a year ago to work for Locog, is charged 
with the theft of two Olympic route network passes.

The passes guarantee fast travel through the capital’s clogged streets in reserved lanes.

He appeared alongside fellow Canadian national Ian Hamilton, 52, who 
is charged with handling the stolen passes, which were reported stolen 
by LOCOG on July 16th and July 18th.

It is alleged Sachedina carried out the theft while working at the 
Games and passed them on to Hamilton who was staying with him at his 
temporary address in Dundee Road, Plaistow, east London.

The pair were arrested by police after being seen acting suspiciously
outside Stratford station on Friday while Sachedina was wearing full 
Olympic uniform.

The court heard Hamilton, who also works in international logistics, 
travelled to London to attend the Olympics on a working holiday after 
securing a contract to provide services to sponsors at the Winter 
Olympics in Russia in 2014.

Refusing the pair bail, Judge Radway said: 'These offences involve 
potentially serious security breaches that may well lead to you 
absconding. The remand for you both is in custody.”

They are next due to appear at Highbury Magistrates Court on August 6th.
