For one it was a photo in a locker. Another penned 'PH 63*' on the back of his shoes. All wore a black armband with his initials, a mark of respect to the much-loved man who will never play alongside them again.

The tributes to Phillip Hughes - small, large and all touching - were everywhere at the Adelaide Oval as Australia took on India in the First Test. Outside flowers were heaped around a shrine of cricket bats and photographs while inside the ground staff had painted a vast 408 – Hughes’ test number – on the grass.

It was in the Australian squad’s dressing room where the sense of loss was most acute. A shirt specially designed to honour the young batsman, with the number 408 embroidered underneath the words '2014/2015 vs India', hung in every player's locker.
