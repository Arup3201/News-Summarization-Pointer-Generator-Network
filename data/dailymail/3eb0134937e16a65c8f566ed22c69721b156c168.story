A divorced Australian mother who was looking for love online has told of the terrifying day a man she met on a dating site beat her so hard with a baseball bat that her head caved in.

Glenn Cable smashed Simone O'Brien, 36, repeatedly at her home in Brisbane in front of her teenage daughters after she broke up with him on September 25, 2012.

In just ten minutes she was left with broken bones, her skull shattered, unconscious and fighting for her life. She has now revealed her ongoing struggle, explaining: 'Seeing myself is scary and makes me frustrated'.

Traumatised: Simone O'Brien has spoken to Channel Nine's A Current Affair show about former boyfriend Glenn Cable who attacked her with a baseball bat

Tearful: The Australian mother was left disfigured by the life threatening attack on September 25, 2012

In a moving interview on Channel Nine's A Current Affair show tonight, Ms O'Brien revealed: 'I can't get out of bed some days, it just seems endless.'

The extent of damage monster 42-year-old Glenn Cable inflicted on the mother-of-three, who had been living in Carseldine, north of Brisbane, can be seen in the interview. Graphic photos show her lying in a hospital bed fighting for her life.

After Ms O'Brien broke off their relationship with a phone call, due to growing doubts and the fact Cable had used a dodgy check to pay the deposit on a house they were meant to be buying together, Mr Cable stormed round to her home.

At 18:06 she made the call and by 18.16 her daughter Gabby was calling an ambulance to save her mother's life after witnessing the savage attack.

Controlling Mr Cable took O'Brien into the bedroom and beat her senseless with a baseball bat that he had - unknowingly to her - stored under her bed.

Her left arm was snapped in two places, her top jaw was shattered so badly that she could barely open her mouth two millimeters, her nose and right cheek bone were broken along with both eye sockets, her skull was completely shattered and she was left blind in one eye.

Talking to host Tracy Grimshaw in the interview, brave Ms O'Brien - who refers to Mr Cable as 'the accused' - is seen with a plaster on her head and the scars of her attack are evident.

Titanium plates were used to rebuild her skull and hold it in position and every couple of weeks she still flies to Brisbane for ongoing treatment at the Princess Alexandra Brain Rehab Unit.

The tearful mother-of-three said: 'It just makes me cringe to think that a person could just hit somebody and keep hitting them.'

Radiographer Karen Roper, who lived on the same street as Ms O'Brien, ran into help her and was horrified by what she found.

'I couldn't make out any features at all... her face was mush,' she said.

Monster: Glenn Cable, shown here in a picture from his online dating profile,  beat Ms O'Brien repeatedly until her skull caved in

Liar: Ms O'Brien met Mr Cable - who gave her the impression he was well off - online on a popular dating site, shown here, in February 2012

Ms O'Brien met Mr Cable - who gave her the impression he was well off - online on a popular dating site in February 2012, four years after her divorce from her children's dad.

He told her he didn't have any children of his own but this later turned out to be just the first of many lies.

She eventually introduced him to her children Gabby, Ashling and Zach but he grew jealous of the time she spent with them and also deleted her friends' numbers from her phone.

Paying for everything in the relationship, Ms O'Brien called it off but got back together with Mr Cable when he proposed to her in front of her children. Â 

'That was done because he knew my kids were my world,' she explained, admitting that she knew their engagement didn't feel right.

Talking about the result the attack, which happened about 10 months after they met, has had on her life, two years on, Ms O'Brien said: 'I've lost my confidence I'm scared to meet people, I cry a lot.'

She said she is speaking out now in the hope that it might save another woman from domestic violence.

Mr Cable was jailed in the Supreme Court in Brisbane for 15 years.

Before: Simone and Trevor, pictured here years before her attack at the hands of Glenn Cable, are now in love again

A jury found him guilty of attempted murder after a trial and he pleaded guilty on April 14, 2014, to two separate counts of fraud, relating to the dishonest purchase of a jet-ski and attempted purchase of a power boat worth $47,000.

Justice Roslyn Atkinson said: 'You did everything you could to destroy that family, but fortunately you haven't.'

He will be eligible to apply for parole release on March 24, 2025, Brisbane's The Courier Mail reports.

Meanwhile, Ms O'Brien has now reunited with her ex husband Trevor after being divorced for six years.

'The kids have been through enough, it's time we pulled our act together,' Trevor says in the show on Tuesday.
