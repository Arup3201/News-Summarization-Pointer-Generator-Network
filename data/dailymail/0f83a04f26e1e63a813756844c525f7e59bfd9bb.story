Resolve: Lord Dannatt says Britain must retain military strength in mainland Europe

Britain must send a strong signal to Russia's aggression in the Ukraine by reversing the cost-cutting decision to remove all troops from Germany.

The number of British servicemen will drop from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, although bolstered by an extra 11,000 reservists, and all troops based in Germany, currently around 20,000, will leave by 2019.

But Lord Dannatt, who was head of the Army from 2006 to 2008, has proposed that 3,000 British soldiers should stay on in Germany to send a clear message to a 'resurgent Russia'.

His comments come as Ukraine's leaders spoke of their fears of an imminent Russian invasion of their eastern industrial heartland after the last airbase in Crimea was taken over.

The concern follows the violent storming of the military compound in Belbek, the biggest show of Russian force in the three weeks Kremlin troops have been stationed in the peninsula.

Since the annexation of the region was confirmed on Friday, Russian troops have began to gather at the eastern border and Ukraine's military leaders believe they are ready to attack 'at any moment.

Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council chief Andriy Parubiy told a rally in Kiev:'The aim of Putin is not Crimea but all of Ukraine... his troops massed at the border are ready to attack at any moment.'

The interim leaders in Kiev fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin is developing a sense he could get away with further actions after the EU and U.S. only handed him limited sanctions.

Lord Dannatt, in an article for The Daily Telegraph, said that military strength will add weight to diplomatic negotiations with Moscow.

'With a resurgent Russia, this is a poor moment for the U.S.-led West to be weak in resolve and muscle,' he said.

'Diplomacy and sanctions may be the right response for now to the Russian president, but he will look beyond those things to see where the real check on his actions might come from.

'An additional 3,000 regular soldiers would provide an extra deployable brigade, sending the signal that Britain takes its defence duties seriously â€“ not only on behalf of its citizens, but on behalf of our EU and Nato allies, too.'

He also expressed concerns that falling troop levels could leave Britain unprepared for unexpected crises, such as the invasion of the Falklands.

NATO's top military commander today added to fears, suggesting Russia had built up a 'very sizeable' force and even speculated Moscow could have other former Soviet states in its sights.

Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove said Moldova, could be next if Putin decides to put his expansionist policies in place.

Breedlove was one of several Western officials and politicians to warn that Russia may not stop there in a crisis that has damaged East-West relations.

'The (Russian) force that is at the Ukrainian border now to the east is very, very sizeable and very, very ready,' the NATO commander told an event held by the German Marshall Fund think-tank.'

U.S. President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said the build-up might just be aimed at intimidating Ukraine's new pro-Western leaders but that Russia could invade the country's mainly Russian-speaking east.

'It's possible that they are preparing to move in,' he told CNN.

Russia said it was complying with international agreements and had no plans to invade. It has called the soldiers who took over Ukrainian bases in Crimea 'self defence forces'.

Around 440 Russian 'peacekeepers' have been deployed in Transdniestria, a breakaway state on the eastern Moldovan border with Ukraine, with soldiers guarding Soviet-era arms stocks.

It follows a launch of a new military exercise in the area, involving 8,500 artillery men, near Ukraine's eastern border 10 days ago.

'There is absolutely sufficient (Russian) force postured on the eastern border of Ukraine to run to Transdniestria if the decision was made to do that, and that is very worrisome,' Breedlove said.

The speaker of Transdniestria's parliament has urged Russia to incorporate the region, which lies to the west of Ukraine.

General Francis Richard Dannatt, 63, was born in Broomfield in Chelmsford, Essex, and joined the Army in 1971.

He served as a platoon commander in  Northern Ireland, where he was awarded the Military Cross.

Despite suffering a major stroke in 1977, Lord Dannatt became a company commander and eventually took command of the Green Howards in 1989.

He took command of 3rd Mechanised Division in 1999 and simultaneously commanded British forces in Kosovo.

After a brief tour in Bosnia, he was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff.

By 2005 Lord Dannatt was Commander-in-Chief, Land Command, and was appointed Chief of the General Staff in August 2006, succeeding General Sir Mike Jackson.

Lord Dannatt faced controversy over his outspokenness, in particular his calls for improved pay and conditions for soldiers and for reducing operations in Iraq to bolster those in Afghanistan.

He also brokered the agreement with the British press that allowed Prince Harry to serve in Afghanistan.

He has served as a defence advisor to David Cameron. He is married with four children, one of whom served as an officer in the Grenadier Guards.
