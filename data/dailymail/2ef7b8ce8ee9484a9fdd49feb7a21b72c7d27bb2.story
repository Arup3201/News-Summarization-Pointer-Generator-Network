Rafa Benitez praised his Napoli side for fighting back to earn a 2-2 draw against Empoli on Sunday, but expressed frustration that they fell two goals behind in the first place.

Empoli looked to be on course for their third win in four Serie A games when Simone Verdi gave them a first-half lead before team-mate Daniele Rugani made it 2-0 eight minutes after the restart.

However, the hosts staged a comeback with Duvan Zapata reducing the deficit in the 67th minute before substitute Jonathan de Guzman made it 2-2 shortly after.

The stalemate at the Stadio San Paolo means fourth-placed Napoli have now drawn their last three league matches to fall 11 points behind leaders Juventus, and while Benitez hailed his side's character in rescuing a point he is frustrated by their sloppy start to the match.

'The character that the team showed in the second half is positive, but I'm not happy because I want to see this attitude from the first minute,' Benitez told Napoli's official website.

'Do not judge this result well because the draw at home is not a positive result. The reaction of the team, however, has been very positive and at the end we might also have won against a team that we knew were playing well.'

Benitez called on his side to start matches brightly in the future so they can begin to convert draws into victories.

'This does not mean that I am satisfied because if I liked the reaction, I did not like the second part of the first half where we made the mistake that allowed Empoli to score,' the Spaniard added.

'We have to score more goals and clearly concede fewer. And above all, we must put in place the right mindset from the first minute.'
