Seven beached sperm whales have died on Yorke Peninsula in South Australia after getting into trouble during a low tide. 

Locals believe that the whales washed ashore on Sunday night while on the hunt for salmon and became stranded when the tide went out.

The whales were found  50m offshore at Parara Beach, about 4km south of Ardrossan.

Seven beached sperm whales have been confirmed dead on Yorke Peninsula in South Australia after getting into trouble during a low tide

Unfortunately, six were dead, with a seventh whale dying later today. 

A fisherman also spotted an eighth sperm whale in shallow water north of the silo jetty today.

The whale was apparently ushered back out to sea by rescuers from the Environment Department.

The trained staff were able to coax the huge whale into deeper water and prevent another death.

Speaking to the ABC, Ardrossan caravan park manager Steve Ruddock said he smelt the whales before her saw them and revealed that some of them were splashing in the shallow water, desperately trying to reach deeper waters. 

'Because they are so fresh, there's no smell, but it won't be long until they get on the nose, I'd say,' he said.

'There's three that are about that size, and the other three are a fraction smaller,' he said.

'We talked to a lot of the locals and there's been the odd sighting now and then on the sea, but this is very unusual,' Mr Ruddock said. 

Environment Department regional co-ordinator Grant Pelton told Adelaide Now that the eighth whale was deeply distressed and was very close to breaching.   

'DEWNR staff and a Department of Transport, Planning and Infrastructure Marine Safety officer located a live seven-metre sperm whale in 1.5 metres of water at Pt Vincent,' regional co-ordinator he said.

Locals believe that the whales washed ashore last night, while on the hunt for salmon and became stranded when the tide went out

'The animal was very lethargic but after some time they managed to encourage it out into deeper water where it dived and they haven't seen it since. They will remain in the area to confirm it doesn't come into the shallows again.' 

Experts believe that there could be many explanations as to why the whales got into trouble. 

One such theory is that one of the whales was sick and went into shallow water, when it felt better it may have called for help from the rest of the pod.

Another explanation may be that the pod were chasing food and got caught in the low tide. 

The whales were found 50m offshore at Parara Beach, about 4km south of Ardrossan

Environment Department animal welfare manager Dr Deborah Kelly was distressed to see the whales on the beach. 

'This is rare,' Dr Kelly said.

'Unfortunately things like this have been happening for thousands of years.'

Twitter users have taken to their social media accounts to express their shock at the freak event

Twitter has been set alight byt the mass death of seven whales in Ardrossan

 It is still uncertain when the whales will be removed from the beach.

With each whale weighing up to 50 tonnes the task may take a while. 

The Environment Department is hoping that post-mortems on the whales will lead to an explanation. 

A witness at the scene told the Advertiser that the whales covered an area of about 500m.

The witness said that one of the whales was still flapping it's tail this morning at 8am, but stopped a short while later. 

The National Marine Mammal Laboratory say male sperm whales can grow up to 60 feet and may live to be 50-70-years-old. 

They say that while sperm whales typically die of natural causes, they are known to mass strand. 

Twitter users have taken to their social media accounts to express their shock at the freak event. 

 Sam Jacobs said: 'Pretty sad to hear about the 6 beached whales in my hometown Ardrossan,'

 Another Twitter user deb d said: 'Fingers crossed they make it back out to sea safely,'
