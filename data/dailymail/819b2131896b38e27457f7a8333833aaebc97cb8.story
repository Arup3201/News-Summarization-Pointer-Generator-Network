A mother who dismissed a cat scratch as nothing to worry about ended up battling a life-threatening blood infection.

Lesley Pleasant, 57, was forced to stay in hospital for a week hooked up to an IV drip - and almost missed her daughter’s wedding.

The incident occurred last month when the PE teacher and sports coach decided to de-flea her daughter’s cat Oscar, and put him in the bath to wash away the treatment. 

Lesley Pleasant claims she had bathed Oscar many times before, but this time he had become scared and scratched her elbow, digging his claws into an artery

The scratch from ten-month-old Persian cat Oscar caused a blood infection which meant Ms Pleasant's arm throbbed and ballooned to twice its normal size (pictured right)

Alarmed, he dug his claws into the crook of her elbow, piercing an artery, and it was 30 seconds before Ms Pleasant’s daughter, Alisha, could get the claw out.

‘It did hurt,’ said Ms Pleasant, ‘but I carried on and didn't think too much of it.

'Then that night I woke up around 2am with a temperature and my arm throbbing - it was really painful and had ballooned in size. 

‘I was very worried - I could barely move my arm so took some painkillers.’ 

At 8am, she asked a friend to drive her to the local hospital at Shepton Mallot, where she was told she needed to go to the larger hospital at Bath.

It is important to pay attention to scratches, no matter how small, advises Dr Suranjith Seneviratne, an immunologist at the Royal Free Hospital, London.

An infected scratch will usually start to look red and infected, and the lymph node will start to swell near the wound after ten days. This will be followed by fever, fatigue, headaches and, in some cases, a loss of appetite, enlarged spleen and sore throat.

Worryingly, Dr Seneviratne adds: ‘A scratch can look like it’s healing, but the bacteria could have travelled to another site. Symptoms can often be seen away from the scratch, because of the incubation period — usually a few days — as the bacteria multiply and divide.’

The bacteria can settle on the heart, liver, brain, kidney and lungs, with those with a low immune system — such as the elderly, babies or someone with an existing illness such as cancer or diabetes — being most at risk.

Upon arrival, she was rushed straight through to A&E for emergency treatment - and immediately put on to a drip. 

Doctors put her on morphine for the pain but she also developed an allergic reaction to the penicillin she was given to fight the infection.

‘I came out in a rash and felt lousy. It was awful - I'm an active person - I teach PE and am a gymnastics coach so lying in bed like that was terrible.’

To make matters worse, the divorced mother-of-four said had also been preparing for her 28-year-old daughter Jessica's wedding.

‘The wedding was the start of August and I was very worried I was going to miss it, which would have been dreadful.'

She was eventually discharged after six days - giving her enough time to recover in time for the big day.  

Looking back, she described her relief at deciding to go to hospital rather ignoring her swollen arm.

‘The scratch was just one of those freak things.

'Oscar had been bathed before, but that time he was just so scared. 

'Thank goodness I had the sense to get to the hospital.’

Alarmed by being bathed, Oscar dug his claws into the crook of Ms Pleasant's elbow, piercing an artery, and it was 30 seconds before her daughter Alisha (right)  could get the claw out
