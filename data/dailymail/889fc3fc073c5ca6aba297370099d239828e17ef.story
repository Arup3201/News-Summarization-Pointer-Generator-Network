Former Prime Minister Tony Blair says the riots are caused by youths from 'profoundly dysfunctional' families

Tony Blair yesterday took a swipe at David Cameron’s ‘muddle-headed’ handling of the fallout from the riots.

In a rare intervention in domestic 
politics, the former Prime Minister suggested Mr Cameron was wrong to 
blame the riots on a general ‘moral decline’ in Britain.

‘I think we are in danger of the wrong analysis leading to the wrong diagnosis, leading to the wrong prescription,’ he said.

But he risked charges of hypocrisy by
admitting that, when in opposition, he had exploited the 1993 murder of
toddler James Bulger by two ten-year-old boys to make political points 
about a wider ‘moral breakdown’ in society.

Mr Cameron said last week that he was
determined to tackle a ‘slow-motion moral collapse’ and mend Britain’s 
‘broken society’.

Yesterday he pledged to lead a fightback against the 
‘destructive culture’ which he said had taken hold.

But Mr Blair said the riots were 
largely due to the actions of a hard core of problem families rather 
than a wider moral decline.

He spoke out as it emerged that 
Scotland Yard believes up to 30,000 people were involved in looting, 
arson and criminal damage during the riots in London.

Metropolitan Police figures show 
3,296 crimes were committed during four days of rioting in the capital. 
Between five and ten people were linked with each crime, so police 
believe they may be looking at between 15,000 and 30,000 suspects.

Not a major problem: Mr Blair said that 'alienated youths from dysfunctional families' were the main cause of this month's rioting

Mr Blair suggested the Prime Minister 
was wrong to order a review of all social policy in the wake of the 
riots.

‘Focus on the specific problem and we can begin on a proper 
solution,’ Mr Blair said in an article in the Observer.

‘Elevate this into a high-falutin’ 
wail about a Britain that has lost its way morally and we will depress 
ourselves unnecessarily, trash our own reputation abroad, and worst of 
all, miss the chance to deal with the problem in the only way that will 
work.’

Mr Blair said politicians ‘miss the 
point’ about the riots when those on the Left say the culprits were 
victims of social deprivation and those on the Right say they needed to 
take responsibility for their actions.

He said the main problem lay with 
alienated youths from dysfunctional families living ‘at odds with any 
canons of proper behaviour’.

Mr Blair says David Cameron and Ed Miliband's parties are missing the true cause behind the riots

He went on: ‘The key is to understand that they aren’t symptomatic of society at large. Failure to get this leads to a completely muddle-headed analysis of what has gone wrong. Britain as a whole is not in the grip of some general “moral decline”.’

Mr Blair accepted that he made a mistake in 1993 when he suggested, as shadow home secretary, that the killing in Liverpool of two-year-old James Bulger had deeper causes in the breakdown of communities.

He said at the time: ‘We cannot exist in a moral vacuum. If we do not learn and then teach the value of what is right and what is wrong, then the result is simply moral chaos which engulfs us all.

‘I have no doubt that the breakdown of law and order is intimately linked to the break-up of a strong sense of community. And the break-up of community in turn is, to a crucial degree, consequent on the breakdown in family life.’

The speech helped to undermine John Major’s Conservative government.

Yesterday Mr Blair said: ‘I now believe that speech was good politics but bad policy.’
