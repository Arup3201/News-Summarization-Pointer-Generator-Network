A furious Prince William wants those responsible for printing the topless pictures of his wife jailed, it has emerged.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge looked happy as they ventured into the Borneo jungle yesterday - just 24 hours after the controversial pictures of Kate were published in a French magazine.

But despite their relaxed appearance, it has emerged the angry Prince is keen to pursue a criminal prosecution against those who snooped on his wife.

Smiling: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ventured into the jungle in Borneo yesterday. Judging by their expressions, though, no one could have guessed that the previous 24 hours had left the Royal couple 'livid' and 'violated'

Fun: While the storm over the topless  photographs of Kate continued to rage elsewhere, they spent the day smiling and joking as they scaled a giant tree

On Friday night St James' Palace confirmed the Royal couple would sue Closer Magazine France.

But it has now emerged Prince William is keen to take criminal action, and has vowed to give evidence at a trial.

According to The Sunday Mirror, when speaking to aides about those responsible for printing the pictures, the angry Prince said: 'I want them jailed.'

A spokesman for Prince William added that he had always felt strongly about privacy and harassment.

He added: 'It’s
 part of a very long-standing and heartfelt position by the Duke and 
Prince Harry, given their past, to do everything they can to protect 
themselves.

'They’ve always said they don’t have an issue with the 
mainstream media just doing their job, but they have always had an issue
 with paparazzi whose work intrudes on their privacy.'

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ventured into the jungle yesterday. This time it was the rainforest variety in Borneo, rather than the legal or media kind. It seemed a symbolically fitting backdrop to their troubles.

Judging by their expressions, though, no one could have guessed that the previous 24 hours had left the Royal couple ‘livid’ and ‘violated’.

While the storm over the topless  photographs of Kate continued to rage elsewhere – more pictures were  published in Ireland – they spent the day smiling and joking as they scaled a giant tree, photographed orang-utans and admired exotic flowers.

This was the type of jungle they could enjoy, a sanctuary from the vicissitudes of the outside world. They even wanted to stay the night. It was a case of I’m A Royal, Keep Me In Here. 

Pretty much their every move was scrutinised of course, but even that didn’t seem to matter too much.

At
 one point, having been winched high into the jungle canopy, William 
spotted a photographer who had been granted official permission to perch
 in an adjacent tree.

It
 must have been quite a shock. But where the previous day he had 
glowered at anyone with a lens, the future King was now all smiles. ‘We 
saw a spy in a tree,’ he later reported, laughing.

Thousands
 of miles away, St James’s Palace was fighting a legal battle on several
 fronts to prevent the further spread of the offending images.

They
 were taken by a photographer using  a long lens as the couple 
sunbathed  on the balcony of Viscount Linley’s chateau in the south of 
France ahead of their nine-day tour of the Far East.Tomorrow, lawyers will seek an injunction in a French court.

They are also thought to be trying to halt the publication of what is being billed as a ‘26-page photo special’ in an Italian magazine.

Yet the Palace could do nothing to stop the Irish edition of the Daily Star printing the same topless pictures  yesterday, a move that even horrified the paper’s owners, who were not  notified beforehand.

Thoughtful: The topless pictures are said to have left the royal couple feeling 'anger and disbelief'

The move was defended by Michael 
O’Kane, the editor of the Dublin-based newspaper, which is a joint 
venture between Northern & Shell – the  publisher of the UK Daily 
Star owned by Richard Desmond – and Ireland’s Independent News and 
Media. 

But Mr Desmond said
 that he was ‘profoundly dismayed’ at the newspaper’s decision, while a 
Northern  & Shell spokesman conceded that  it was a ‘grotesque 
invasion’ of the couple’s privacy.Outrage came from all quarters.

The
 Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, said: ‘It would be a very sad day 
when we are taken into the gutter of believing that every woman wants to
 flaunt her body for all to see.

‘The
 only time we cannot escape revealing our nakedness is when we are born.
 Beyond that our culture has said that the only other time should be in 
the privacy of our homes.’

In
 another development, a female French photographer who took pictures of 
the Duchess sunbathing at the chateau – but not, she says, the topless 
ones – tried to distance herself from the affair.

Valerie Suau’s work, which she 
insisted was ‘decent’, was published  in La Provence newspaper last 
Saturday with no complaint from the Royal Family.

‘Valerie is extremely concerned by the fuss and is naturally keeping a low profile,’ said a colleague.The
 look of thunder on Prince William’s face as he left Kuala Lumpur, teeth
 clenched, yesterday morning was obvious. But it subsided by the time 
the Royal party reached Sabah, one of the two states that make up the 
Malaysian part of Borneo.

The
 Duchess was dressed for  the jungle in slim-cut beige jeans  and a 
plaited brown leather belt,  sturdy walking boots, and a sheer  green 
blouse over a black T-shirt.

The
 couple declined the use of ‘anti-leech socks’. ‘Apparently they didn’t 
pass the sartorial test,’ explained one of  their party.

However,
 the Duchess may have regretted that decision as a jungle leech later 
attached itself to her leg. ‘She dealt with it very calmly and just bent
 down and picked it off.’

Grotesque: The magazine put three naked photos of the Duchess of Cambridge on the front cover

Tengku Adlin, a Malaysian prince who 
had previously accompanied Prince Philip in a helicopter flight over the
 rainforest when he visited the region in 1972, flew in with  the 
couple.

He said: ‘They enjoyed it immensely, 
they asked lots of questions about primates, birds and insects, and Kate
 was taking a lot of photos.’ On arriving at a field centre, the couple 
attended a short briefing with a group of Malaysian and  British 
scientists.

They were then 
fitted with special harnesses and helmets in a private room before being
 hoisted 138ft up into a giant parashorea tomentella tree using a 
‘counterweight pulley system’ which had been set by technicians to their
 combined weight, believed to be about 23 stone.

As
 they waited in their harnesses at the base of the tree, the Duke looked
 at his wife and quipped:  ‘Girls don’t have the same wardrobe 
malfunctions as men do.

‘I hope I don’t have any wardrobe malfunctions.’

The Duchess, appearing apprehensive as she looked upwards at her route of ascent, said: ‘I’m going to go “whee” and just fly up.’

William joked: ‘It’s not quite as impressive as the Shard,’ referring to his uncle the Duke of York’s abseil from London’s tallest building.

Dr Glen Reynolds, the director  of the Royal Society’s South East Asia research programme, who accompanied the couple, replied: ‘Size isn’t everything.’

The Duke and Duchess had such a good time that they hoped to spend the night in the jungle but their team decided against it lest the unpredictable and fast-changing weather  prevented them from advancing on to the Solomon Islands today on the next stage of their tour.
