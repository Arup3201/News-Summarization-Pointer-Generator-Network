Yaya Toure has revealed his ultimate dream team - and there is no place for any of his fellow Manchester City stars.

Having won the title twice alongside some of the Premier League's best players, including Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany, the Ivory Coast midfielder could have been expected to include one or two of his current colleagues.

Instead, Toure's team has a very retro feel, with a number of stars from the Nineties.

Toure has lifted the Premier League title twice with Man City but opted for stars of the 1990s in his team

Speaking ahead of his side's crucial Champions League fixture against Bayern Munich, the Ivorian does give the nod to one former City player - Patrick Vieira - having played with the Frenchman during his first season in the North West. 

While fans are often split between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in the debate of who is the world's best player, Toure - having spent three years with Barcelona - doesn't hesitate in plumping for his former Nou Camp team-mate.

With Messi stuck out on the right wing, another Argentina legend, Diego Maradona, is on the left.

Former Real Madrid and Juventus star Zinedine Zidane - a World Cup winner with France in 1998 - completes Toure's midfield; the skills of Zidane complimenting the tough-tackling style of Vieira.

Supporters of Manchester United may be surprised to read the name of Toure's team's goalkeeper - France's World Cup winning keeper Fabien Barthez.

Ahead of him are a trio of AC Milan defensive legends, Cafu, Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini, who are joined by former West Germany captain Franz Beckenbauer at the back.

Brazil legend Pele is an obvious choice up front and is joined by former Italy No 10 Roberto Baggio.

Toure was seemingly a big Serie A fan growing up - seven of his selections played in Italy in the 1990s.
