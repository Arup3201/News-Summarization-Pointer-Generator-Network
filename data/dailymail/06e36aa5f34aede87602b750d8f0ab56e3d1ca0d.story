On-loan Hull players Joe Arundel and Jay Pitts scored against their parent club as already doomed Bradford Bulls made it three wins out of three for the first time this season with a 34-28 victory over the Black and Whites at the Provident Stadium, Odsal.

The Championship-bound Bulls had surprisingly beaten champions Wigan and Challenge Cup finalists Leeds in their previous two games and gained a third successive success by coming from 12 points down to outscore their East Yorkshire opponents six tries to four with Jamie Foster, who also had a spell on loan at Hull, adding five goals for the hosts.

Hull have now won just one of their last eight games, ironically against Super League leaders St Helens, and this latest defeat virtually ends any realistic hopes of extending their season into the play-offs.

Hull remain five points behind Widnes, who hold the eighth and final play-off place, with only three games remaining.

Close win: Bradford Bulls' Luke Gale is tackled by Hull FC's Gareth Ellis during his side's Super League victory

The visitors took advantage of strong and blustery wind to get the better of a first half played in occasionally squally showers but, once the sides had swapped ends, the Bulls always held the upper hand.

Helped forward by a penalty for interference, some slick handling and a neat inside pass from Dean Hadley put Jamie Shaul in beside the posts for his 15th try of the season with Joe Westerman converting to give the Black and Whites the best possible start.

Luke Gale almost grabbed a try back but was forced into touch near the corner flag by Shaul. Westerman almost put Richard Horne clear but Brett Kearney thwarted the attack before Gareth Ellis helped double the visitors lead form close range after the Bulls had again been penalised, this time for reefing, near their own line.

Poor ball control did not help the hosts' cause and they were forced to soak up more pressure before, on a rare venture forward, a Luke Gale kick was allowed to bounce fortuitously for the Bulls and Arundel, on a season-long loan from the KC Stadium, sent Jamie Foster racing over on the left to score, then convert his own try, topping the 1000 career points mark in the process.

Hull had chances to restore their advantage as Westerman was denied a try by a forward pass, then Richard Horne intercepted a loose pass from Gale but Danny Addy executed a fine stop.

But a minute later a Lee Gaskell break sent Arundel racing 30 metres into the corner to touchdown, although Foster was unlucky to see his conversion swept onto the near upright by the wind and bounce out again.

Barely three minutes into the second half, good work from Gaskell created a chance for Adam Sidlow to power over and give the Bulls the lead for the first time.

Five minutes later Arundel dummied his way over for a second try against his parent club, then Gaskell split the defence gifting Pitts with a try and, with Foster adding all three conversions, the momentum swing was complete at 28-12.

Ellis grabbed a quick-fire try back for Hull and Danny Houghton was adjudged to be held up just before the hour mark as Hull tried to get back in the game.

But an Addy try with ten minutes to go made the points safe for the Bulls, although Setaimata Sa claimed a late try and Tom Lineham added a further consolation for the Airlie Birds with Westerman finishing with four goals.
