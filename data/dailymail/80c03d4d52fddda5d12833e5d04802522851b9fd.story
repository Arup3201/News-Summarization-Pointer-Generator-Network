Sam Stephens is taking fundraising  to new heights, vowing to legally change his name to Buzz Lightyear if he raises $4,000 for a children's cancer charity.

The 26-year-old toy story fanatic will run in the Brighton Marathon in April to raise money for charity after learning of his friend, Joe Grimley, loosing his younger sister to leukemia. 

‘I wanted to something a bit personal and cancer is obviously a big deal, especially in children, it’s horrible,’ told The Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Stephens said he wanted to bring something 'a bit different and unique' to his fundraising events, ultimately taking it 'to infinity and beyond' by setting a series of Toy Story related goals on the way.

He says if reaches $2,400, he will get a Buzz tattoo on his thigh. If he manages to raise $4,000, he will take the plunge and officially change his name with deed poll to 'Buzz Lightyear' like the Space Ranger from the Universe Protection Unit.

'This means there will be no more Samuel Thomas Stephens, I will be known on all my official documents, (passport driving license etc) and to the whole entire universe as Buzz Lightyear,' Mr Stephens says on his donation website.

Mr Stephens has been overwhelmed with the public's response, as donations have been flooding in after his plight hit news websites a few days ago.

'I never expected it to blow up like this.' 

‘In two days I had close to 250 pounds(A$495) come in from all over the world. People I don’t even know, from America and even Finland.’

In what the philanthropist has labelled 'drytashamarathon', Mr Stephens will also be taking part in 'Movember', which means he'll sport a moustache until the marathon, and 'Dryathalon', a sobering challenge where he will abstain from drinking.

Mr Stephens has already achieved two of his goals by raising an astonishing $2,000. This means he'll don a Buzz Lightyear costume while running the 26-mile marathon, and let those who have donated to his cause style his new facial hair.

'I want to do all I can to help raise awareness and I think the Toy Story theme adds a nice touch to what we are trying to achieve.'

'Buzz Lightyear is a childhood hero of mine and I am looking forward to my kids being called Lightyear and my wife, Mrs Lightyear,' Mr Stephens told The Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Stephens, who is currently working in Australia, says he won't do anything by half measure, looking outside the box to give people more incentive to donate.

The 26-year-old Brighton man has been travelling and training for the marathon in Sydney, Australia with plans to return home in April.
