Golf sensation Bubba Watson, who won green jacket glory after a Masters playoff earlier this month, has withdrawn from an upcoming tournament to focus on his wife and son, whom the couple adopted just two weeks before his nail-biting win in Augusta.

The often emotional golfer posted a heartwarming photo to his Twitter account over the weekend of him holding baby Caleb with the caption: 'My boy & his lil green jacket'.

Watson told Wells Fargo Championship officials that he won't play because that tournament, combined with The Players Championship the following week, would keep him away from home for three weeks.

And that's too long for Watson, 33, who adopted Caleb on March 26 with his wife, Angie.

He will, however, defend his Masters title at the Zurich Classic in New Orleans next week.

The Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow Golf Course in Charlotte, North Carolina, goes from May 3-6.

Despite losing Watson, Wells Fargo still expects to attract a strong field - with Rory 
McIlroy, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Lee Westwood and Hunter Mahan expected to tee off.

Bubba, a big-hitting golfer, won the Masters after hitting a dramatic 250-yard shot on his way to victory on an extraordinary final day at Augusta.

He defeated South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen on the second hole in a play-off to win his first major title.

And
it was double joy for the golfer from Bagdad, Florida, who became a 
father for the first time after adopting weeks earlier because Angie Watson is unable to have children.

Shortly after being fitted with the 
green jacket, Watson said he was looking forward to going home to see 
his boy - but joked that he had not yet changed a diaper.

The American golfer won $1.44million 
(Â£900,000) in prize money as he won his first major.

After securing the victor on April 8,
he broke down and cried hard on his mother Molly's shoulder as they 
embraced on the 10th green.

The new champion's success is even more 
impressive given that he has never had a formal golf lesson in his life,
being self-taught since his father Garry, who died of throat cancer in 2010, showed him how to hold a 
club.

Garry Watson introduced him to the sport when he 
took him to a golf course at age six. And despite becoming a dedicated 
player he never had a formal lesson in his life.

He doesn't employ a coach or a sports psychologist to improve his game - and his go for broke playing style is unique.

Bubba, a committed Christian, said after his Easter Sunday win: 'My dad's not here, but he's watching in heaven'.

The golfer, who has one of the longest drives in the sport, has always been regarded as a poor putter.

It was Watson's dramatic shot on the 10th hole that helped him win the tournament.

Trapped among the trees 155 yards 
from the hole and unable to see the green, the left-hander hit a huge 
hook and landed the ball safely on the green.

From there, Watson caught up to with 
Oosthuizen who looked set to win by making four consecutive birdies on 
holes 13 through to 16.

Bubba - whose real 
name is Gerry - started the adoption process with Angie four years ago.

'It finally came to this winter that we could do it,' he said.

Bubba's
wife Angie, a former Olympic-standard basketball player, stands head 
and shoulders above other golfing WAGs at 6ft 4in tall.

She met Bubba when they were both at the University Of Georgia and they got married in September 2004.

The basketball player told Bubba on their first date they she would never be able to have children.

When injury finally put paid to her professional career, she decided to do become her husband's agent.

Asked if he had dreamed about a putt to win The Masters he added: 'I dreamed about it - I just never made the putt.'

He won the tournament with a tap in from six inches.

'I wanted to make sure I focused hard 
on that putt, because I knew how delicate these situations are and how 
this may never happen again.'

Oosthuizen was trying to become the 
first South African winner in five years after Trevor Immelman and last 
year's champion Charl Schwartzel.
