A couple with a combined weight of 45st shed nearly half their bulk after being told they would be dead in a few years if they carried on overeating.

Joanne Richards and Barry Ricketts had both been overweight since childhood and were dubbed Fatty Jo and Big Baz by school bullies.

The pair were both so unfit they struggled to get round the house they shared in Stourbridge in the West Midlands. Miss Richards even stored her clothes downstairs because she could not make it up to their bedroom to get changed.

'Before' (left) and 'after' (right) holiday snaps of Joanne Richards, 31, and Barry Ricketts, 43, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, show their incredible transformation

The 31-year-old tipped the scales at 24st 5lbs and wore a size 32, while her long-term partner Mr Ricketts, 43, was 21st and wore a six XXXL trouser.

It was not until Miss Richards' periods stopped and they were both warned that their size was putting a strain on their bodies, that the couple,  paired up to lose weight.

'I was told I would die by the time I was 40 if I kept going the way I was,' Miss Richards says.

'I couldn't believe how bad we'd got and knew it was now or never to lose weight. It had to happen.'

 Left: Joanne Richards, 31, weighted 24st 5lbs and Barry Ricketts, 43 was 21st; Right: Joanne lost 13st 7lbs and now weighs 10st 12lbs and Barry lost 7st 5lbs and reached his goal weight, 13st 9lbs

'I was told I would die by the time I was 40 if I kept going the way I was,' Miss Richards says

She started gaining weight when she was nine and was bullied because of it.

She said: 'The kids at school called me Fatty and Big Jo. I should have lost weight but I comfort ate instead. I snacked on crisps and chocolates, and on my way home I'd stop in the chippy.

'Before long I was on a takeaway a day.'

By 25, Miss Richards weighed more than 20st and her health was suffering.

She said: 'I huffed and puffed everywhere I went but it didn't stop me eating.'

In 2008, Miss Richards' partner moved in and after a hard day's work, they found it easier to grab a pizza or Chinese than prepare a healthy meal.

Miss Richards said: 'I made sure our son, Josh, ate healthily, but Barry and I continued to eat junk.

Miss Richards ditched the takeaways and in March 2012 she joined her local Weight Watchers class. She said: 'I was taught how to follow their healthy eating plan, find healthy alternatives and eat smaller portions'

'Soon, being overweight not only affected our health but our relationship with Josh too.

'He'd want to go for a walk or play football and we'd make excuses to avoid anything energetic. We were so unfit.

'It must have hurt him to hear "no" all the time.'

Then in November 2011, Miss Richards' periods stopped and she was told it was because of her weight.

A dietician said losing 13st would improve her health, and suggested a gastric band.

She said: 'At first I thought it was a great idea, an easy way to lose weight.

'But I'd always loved food and when I realised it would mean I would never be able to eat properly again, I said no.

'I didn't want to lose weight so fast I was left with saggy skin, too. So I decided to try and lose weight on my own.'

Miss Richards ditched the takeaways and in March 2012 she joined her local Weight Watchers class.

She said: 'I was taught how to follow their healthy eating plan, find healthy alternatives and eat smaller portions. My group leader was full of tips.'

Feeling encouraged following her first class, Miss Richards decided to walk to her mum's house three miles away to get some exercise, but things didn't go to plan.

'It should have taken me an hour, but it took me four,' she said. 'I'd always thought I was young so I was healthy, but I kept stopping because my knees and feet hurt.

Miss Richards (left, after her weight loss, and right, with son Josh before she shed the pounds) even used to store her clothes downstairs because she couldn't make it up to the bedroom to get changed

'I got out of breath and suddenly realised just how unfit I was.'

Mr Ricketts offered to show his support by eating the same low-calories meals as her.

Then when he saw her lose half a stone a week, he joined Weight Watchers too.

Mr Ricketts said: 'I'd always thought I could eat what I liked – massive curries, all-you-can-eat carveries.

'I had a huge appetite and would only stop when my stomach hurt. I didn't care how I looked. Eating made me happy.

'But my health was suffering too and I realised someone of my size could have a severely reduced mortality and I wanted to live to see my son grow up.

'So I decided to lose weight as well. I'd always thought it would be hard work and I'd never be a normal size. I guess I'd accepted my lot.'

Mr Rickards (left, before his diet, right with son Josh) lost 7st 5lbs and reached his goal weight, 13st 9lbs

But the couple spurred each other on, and as the weight fell off, they even started exercising.

'We went for walks together, to the gym twice a week, and swimming,' Miss Richards said: 'I wouldn't have dared do any of that before. I would have been too embarrassed to walk around in a swimsuit, and too unfit.'

They also went on bike rides with Josh, now 11, and walked their dog, a Lurcher.

Miss Richards said: 'Suddenly we had all this energy to keep fit, which kept the weight off.'

In early 2013 she even took part in two walking marathons.

While her partner – who had lost 7st 5lbs and reached his goal weight, 13st 9lbs – ditched his XXXL trousers for slim, medium jeans.

Later that year Miss Richards also launched her first slimming class.

After losing 13st 7lbs and weighing 10st 12lbs, she wanted to help others.

Miss Richards, who's now a size 12, said: 'I love seeing my members reach their goals.

'I'm really pleased I didn't turn to surgery to lose weight, and did it with Barry.

'Doing it as a couple helped us keep going. I couldn't have done it alone.

'We can do so much more with Josh now, too, which is great.'

Mr Ricketts added: 'We're so much happier now, how we look and feel.

'Losing weight has brought us all closer together.'
