West Ham hope to complete the signing of Anderlecht's Cheikhou Kouyate on Monday following a medical.

The Senegalese defender was on the wish-list of La Liga's Valencia but it seems the Hammers have fought off competition to bag the 24-year-old.

A Â£7million deal is expected to be hashed out for the player who can also play in a midfield role.

Target: West Ham look to have all but signed Kouyate following a medical with the Hammers

Sam Allardyce has been given an ultimatum by West Ham's co-owners David Gold and David Sullivan.

The pair have demanded the Hammers boss provides more entertainment next season, and that would start with more flair in the side.

Teddy Sherringham has joined the Upton Park outfit as an attacking coach, while Argentinian striker Mauro Zarate joined on a three-year deal from Velez Sarsfield.

At the other end, Allardyce has his eye on Manchester City defenders Joleon Lescott and Micah Richards, and also goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon.
