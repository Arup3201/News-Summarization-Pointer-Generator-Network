Sheffield United have bowed to the wishes of their fans and severed their relationship with convicted rapist Ched Evans.

Club officials sparked a public outcry when they accepted a request from the Professional Footballers' Association to let their former striker train with the club following his release after serving half of a five-year prison sentence.

Evans maintains he is innocent of raping a woman in a hotel room in April 2012 and has made an application to the criminal cases review commission for an appeal.

But the announcement last week to let Evans train with the club led to several high profile supporters standing down as patrons of the club, while Olympic champions Jessica Ennis-Hill said she would want the stand named after her at Bramall Lane to be renamed if Evans was re-signed.

Television presenter Charlie Webster, musicians Paul Heaton and Dave Berry and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham have all resigned from their roles with the club, while a petition against Evans rejoining the club attracted more than 150,000 signatures.

The club board came under further pressure when Ennis-Hill's statement led to her being subjected to sickening abuse on Twitter.

In a statement, Sheffield United said: 'Following the statement dated 11th November and after ongoing and extensive deliberation, Sheffield United Football Club has decided to retract the opportunity for its former player, Ched Evans, to use the club's facilities for training purposes, as was previously intended.

'Members of the Board have consulted dispassionately with the club's supporters, vice presidents, Community Foundation members, executives, staff, sponsors and other relevant stakeholders in order to help it reach this decision.

'Also, the club has been diligent in communicating with The Football Association, The Football League, The Professional Footballers' Association (The PFA), The Football Association of Wales and The National Probation Service to take further soundings.

'We recognise that a number of our supporters will be disappointed with this decision, but would ask that they remember the responsibilities we have not only to a fine and proud club, whose history stretches back over 125 years, but also to the communities in which Sheffield United is active and to the city we represent.

'The club initially accepted a request from The PFA for Ched Evans to be able to train. The reaction to this has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated when first announced.

'As noted in previous statements from the club, the legal system of this country provides for both the punishment and the rehabilitation of every person who has been found guilty of a crime.

'Sheffield United will not be used to promote the view that professional footballers should be treated differently, as has been the want of certain sections of the media and various commentators. In addition, we remain disappointed at some of the inaccurate reporting, misinformed views and commentary, as well as the actions of a minority of individuals on social media. Professional footballers must be treated as equals before the law.

'The club condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms. The club is aware that Ched Evans is pursuing legal recourse via the Criminal Cases Review Commission in the determination he has to clear his name. We trust that he will be afforded a fair hearing.

'During this whole period, we have been served a timely reminder of what we have been throughout our history: Sheffield United is a family and community club that, even in times of adversity, will remain strong and grow from its experiences.

'The club will not be making any further comment on this issue.'
