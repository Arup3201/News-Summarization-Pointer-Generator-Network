A New England Patriots star partied at a Boston bar with a man who was found murdered near his house just hours later and was 'tied directly' to the killing, it was claimed today.

After leaving a bar with Odin Lloyd on Sunday night, NFL star Aaron Hernandez destroyed surveillance video taken at his $1.3million home and then hired a cleaning crew to scrub his mansion clean, according to ABC News.

Fox 25 quoted a police source as saying Hernandez left the bar with Lloyd and two friends in a rented SUV on Sunday night, but only three men returned to Hernandez's mansion in North Attleborough, Massachusetts.

Reports suggest the 23-year-old tight end is 'likely' to be arrested in the case - though police say they are not ready to charge anyone at the moment.

Stepping out: Aaron Hernandez, 23, attracted attention as he left his $1.3million home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, on Thursday

Victim: Odin Lloyd has been identified as the man who was found dead less than a mile away from the $1.3million mansion of New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez

Police spent several hours searching Hernandez's large, suburban home

Massachusetts State police have not named a suspect in the case. However, a Boston Globe reporter and Sports Illustrated are reporting that Hernandez's arrest is 'likely,' according to unnamed sources. It is not clear what charges police would pursue against Hernandez.

On Tuesday night, officers searched 
Hernandez's home for three hours. The star player had been cooperating 
with police, but has since hired a lawyer and stopped talking, according
to Fox 25.

ABC News reports that Massachusetts State Police are planning to return to Hernandez's house for a longer, more extensive search today because they believe he may have tampered with evidence.

A police source told the network that Hernandez's security system was smashed - including the surveillance videos. He also handed over his cell phone to investigators 'in pieces.'

On Monday, before Lloyd's body was found, he also hired a cleaning crew to scrub the mansion, the police source said.

Hernandez, who signed a five-year, 
$37.5million contract with the Patriots last year, refused to answer 
questions from the press as he arrived at Gillette Stadium on in an Audi
SUV on Thursday.

Star: Aaron Hernandez is involved in a murder investigation and is also being sued over an alleged shooting

His attorneys and his agent have declined to comment on the case.

Mr Lloyd, 27, a Boston Bandits players, was found shot 
dead in an industrial park less than a mile away from Hernandez's home 
on Monday evening.

He was reportedly dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend.

Odin Lloyd's uncle said he had last 
seen his nephew on Sunday and described as a 'good guy' who lived in 
Dorchester and loved football.

Since 2007, Lloyd had been a linebacker for the Bandits semi-pro football team, Olivier Bustin, the team’s head coach told Boston.com.

He
said Lloyd, a speedy pass rushing specialist listed at 5-foot-11 and 
215 pounds, learned to play football at the John D. O’Bryant School of 
Mathematics and Science, in Roxbury.

'We
had our first scrimmage on Saturday night,' he told the Boston Globe. 
'He participated. He played well. Was in good spirits. He was helping 
mentor a younger player.'

The scrimmage finished around 9:30pm and that was the last Bustin heard from Lloyd, he said.

'He
was a very personable player,' he said. 'Every person on our team got 
along with him. I can’t remember any player having any beef with him.'

This week, Hernandez was sued by his 
former friend friend and personal assistant Alexander Bradley over 
claims that he shot Bradley in the face during a fight at a Miami 
nightclub in February.

Bradley
claims he lost one eye when a gun owned by Hernandez went off in his 
car as they drove away together following a heated argument.

Last week, the Patriots star was made the subject of a lawsuit filed by Mr Bradley,
who is seeking damages to compensate him for the loss of his eye, which
has apparently forced him to undergo several operations in hospital.

His lawyer David Jaroslawicz told ABC News: 'A bullet went through my client's arm and blew out his 
right eye. It has been 
enucleated - replaced with a prosthetic eye. He has also lost use of 
his right arm.'

Mr Bradley has also claimed that Hernandez did not have a license for the gun that was discharged.

No criminal charges are believed to 
have been filed over the case, and Miami police have been unable to 
confirm whether or not they have any record of the incident, said to 
have taken place in February.

A
neighbor of Odin’s told WBZ they had seen Hernandez in the neighborhood
and that Odin dated the sister of Hernandez’s girlfriend.

Massachusetts State police spoke to Hernandez on Monday and sought a warrant to search his home. Law enforcement sources described him as 'uncooperative'.

During the search on Monday, two men 
tried to leave the $1.3 million, 5,600-square foot home, which is 
outfitted with a home gym and a swimming pool, but were stopped on the 
drive by police.

According to ABC News, their car was also searched.

The
news service also said a hand-delivered package arrived addressed for 
Hernandez during the time of the search, from a well-known law firm.

A rental vehicle with Rhode Island plates was recovered near the scene, which led investigators to Hernandez, sources told ABC News.

The
jogger who found the body on Monday - who did not want to be identified -
described what he saw to WBZ-TV: 'I saw an African-American male, 
probably 25-35 years old, decently dressed.

'He
was stiff, motionless, one of the police officers came back later and 
said it looked the guy had been shot somewhere else and dumped here.'

A
fourth-round pick in the 2010 draft, Hernandez was named to the Pro 
Bowl in his second season. Last season he caught 51 passes and scored 
five touchdowns for the Patriots.

He is spending the off-season recovering from a shoulder scope.

Hernandez,
a University of Florida Graduate and native of Bristol, Connecticut., 
was drafted by the Patriots in 2010. He had five touchdowns for the Pats
during the 2012 season.

On
August 27, 2012, the Patriots signed Hernandez to a five-year 
extension, which included a $12.5 million signing bonus, the largest 
signing bonus ever given to an NFL tight end, and the second-largest 
extension ever, after teammate Rob Gronkowski's.
