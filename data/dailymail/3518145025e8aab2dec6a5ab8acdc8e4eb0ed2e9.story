A 52-year-old man may never walk again after being thrown off his bicycle and into a sinkhole, where he lay through the night. 

David Keys, from Waihi in Hauraki District in the North Island of New Zealand, heard his neck snap as he landed in the one-metre deep hole at Morgan Park in Waihi on Wednesday evening.

He fell in and out of consciousness as he lay in the hole, waiting for someone to discover him.

Before the bike ride, Mr Keys searched for his headlamp but did not find it - he went riding anyway. 

His brother Ian Keys said since it was still daylight, David thought it would be fine to ride around the park with his dog,Stuff New Zealand reported. 

'He was totally unaware of the hole being here', Ian said. 

The hole was hidden by shrubs off the edge of the park's car-park.

Ian said his brother was only doing 5-kilometres per hour when he hit the hole, causing him to fly over the handlebars. 

'People were still on the netball courts but he couldn't call for help because he could barely breathe', Ian said. 

'He lay on his bike... He watched them turn the lights out at the netball court and everyone go home and he knew he would going to be in for a long night'. 

Mr Keys layed in the one-metre deep hole over night, drifting in and out of consciousness, unable to move or call for help 

A Hauraki District Council worker discovered David at 4:15am on Friday. By then David was severely injured and suffering from hypothermia. 

Auckland-based Westpac rescue helicopter flew David to Auckland City Hospital before being transferred to Middlemore Hospital, where he underwent a three-hour operation to fix together bones in his neck. 

'He's paralysed from the neck down', Ian said.

David's family and doctors fear he could be 'a quadriplegic for the rest of his life'. 

Amber Keys, David's niece describes her uncle as an 'active and fit person' with a 'passion for hunting'. 

She said not being able to walk again will not only affect David, but the people around him. 

Langley Cavers, CEO of Hauraki Council said the council had no idea that the sinkhole existed and has since been sealed off to prevent another accident. 

'Typically when we become aware of them we will fill them,' Mr Cavers said. 

He said the council are thinking of the David and his family during this awful time. 

'It's a tragedy', Mr Cavers said.
