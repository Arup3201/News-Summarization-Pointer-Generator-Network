Atletico Madrid kept pace with their rivals at the top as they brushed aside neighbours Rayo Vallecano 3-1 on Saturday night.

Antoine Griezmann scored a brace but somehow missed out on a hat-trick despite a string of second-half chances.

France forward Griezmann cut out a pass by defender Ze Castro and slotted past keeper Tono after 12 minutes. He then latched onto a flick-on from Mario Mandzukic and again produced a precise finish to double Atletico's lead.

Rayo pulled a goal back through Roberto Trashorras before the break but Manucho diverted a corner into his own goal 10 minutes after the restart.

Griezmann was close to his hat-trick late on but his shot from the right of the penalty area came back off the post.

Atletico could not afford a slip against a Rayo side who arrived having won five of their 10 away games in the league this season.

However the champions found their local rivals in generous form, with Rayo's defence lending a helping hand all night.

Meanwhile, Xabi Prieto's second-half goal ensured Real Sociedad returned to winning ways.

Prieto headed home the game's only goal at the Anoeta to see off Basque neighbours Eibar 1-0 and earn David Moyes' side a welcome three points after last weekend's home loss at the hands of Rayo Vallecano.

The result lifted Sociedad to 11th place, and left Eibar eighth.
