Members of Islamic State have admitted for the first time that they were defeated in the Syrian town of Kobane.

Airstrikes by the US-led coalition were the main reason why extremists were forced to withdraw from the town, according to two of the group's fighters.

It comes days after activists and Kurdish officials said Kobane was cleared of ISIS militants, who once held nearly half of the town.

The failure to capture Kobane was a major blow to the extremists, whose hopes for an easy victory turned into a costly siege under airstrikes by coalition forces and an assault by Kurdish militiamen.

The United States and its allies have carried out 27 air strikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria since Friday, the Combined Joint Task Force leading the operation reported on Saturday.

Some 13 air strikes targeted areas near Kobane in just 24 hours, it was reported on Wednesday.

The strikes around Kobane hit 12 Islamic State tactical
units and a vehicle, and destroyed nine fighting positions, a
staging area and three buildings, the Combined Joint Task Force
said in a statement.

The Pentagon said at the time that the militants had been driven
out of 90 percent of Kobane, a city near the border with Turkey
where fighting has raged for four months.

Six air strikes in northern Iraq, where Islamic State
has seized swathes of territory, targeted al Asad, Kirkuk, Mosul
and Sinjar, hitting tactical units, a checkpoint, six buildings
and six shipping containers, the task force said.
