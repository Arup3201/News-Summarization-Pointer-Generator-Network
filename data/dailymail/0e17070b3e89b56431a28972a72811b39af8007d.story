There is no disputing the fact that 'soccer' is on the rise in the USA. But despite that, Clint Dempsey - captain of the American national team - still faced some identity problems as he took to the streets of New York.

Tasked with questioning people about himself and the state of the United States men's national team, Dempsey, making no attempt to hide his appearance, was not recognised by any members of the public regardless of his stature in the game and 109 appearances for his country.

Approaching one man, Dempsey said: 'What do you think about the captain of the US men's national team? How do you think he's been playing?'

Despite his stature, Clint Dempsey asking the public about Clint Dempsey threw up some disappoint results

The response came in the form of a mumbled statement about how he should have played, but that it was the coaches decision not to select him. 

Hold on a minute... has this guy got the right man? After all, Dempsey played every match at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

Undeterred, Dempsey battled on: 'What was the name of the captain of the US men's national team?'

'Erm...Landon Donovan?'

Moving on to the next interrogation, Dempsey asked for thoughts on how the national side had been performing of late.

He received the reply: 'It's actually good, but it didn't do very well at the World Cup.'

'I'll let the team know,' replied Dempsey.
