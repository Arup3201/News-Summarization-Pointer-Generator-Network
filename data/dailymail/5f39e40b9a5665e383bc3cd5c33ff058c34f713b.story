A teenage Justin Welby rediscovered his Christian faith after dealing with the suicide of a teenage boy while on his gap year in Kenya, a new book has revealed.

The new biography of Archbishop Welby said that while an 18-year-old gap year student teaching with an Anglican Missionary group, he was suffering a crisis of faith describing himself as 'agnostic'.

However, after the traumatic experience, the young Welby told a friend that he had 're-committed himelf' to Christ.

During his gap year in Kenya in 1974 Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, pictured, had to cut down the body of a school boy who had taken his own life, an event which caused him to reaffirm his faith

The book, by
 Oxford academic Dr Andrew Atherstone, has discovered correspondence 
that covers the period of Archbishop Welby's conversion.

The Archbishop travelled to Kenya in January 1974 aged 18.

 He joined fellow teacher Phil Kelly, who was three years older, in the Anglican missionary organisation.

Mr Kelly regularly wrote home to his mother and some of that correspondence has been used by Dr Atherstone for his profile of Archbishop Welby.

In the correspondence, Mr Kelly tells his mother that the young Justin Welby felt 'agnostic'.

However following the suicide in Kiburu, Kenya, Mr Kelly noticed a difference in the future Archbishop's outlook on the world. He and Archbishop Welby had to cut the teenager's body down from a tree.

The biography, pictured, chronicles Archbishop Welby's early life in extensive detail as well as his first year in office and features numerous interviews with the Archbishop's friends and family

He said: 'Justin
 says that for the last 11 months or so his Christian faith has been in 
decline so much so that a fortnight ago he reckons that he was more 
agnostic than Christian.

'But he felt that I had got something which 
he hadn’t so he began praying again … and a couple of days ago 
re-dedicated his life and accepted Christ as Lord, since when he has 
felt much better and also had the growing feeling to write to his Dad 
about their mutual relations.'

Mr Kelly told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I don’t honestly know whether in a Justin’s mind the two were connected.

'It
 was a pretty harrowing and depressing occasion and I know I didn’t 
sleep too well for the next week or so and a lot of kids were very upset
 about it.'

The book reveals that Archbishop 
Welby's mother Jane sold a diamond ring she had inherited from her 
godmother to fund his gap year trip to Kenya.

Before his religious studies, Archbishop Welby had been a senior oil executive working for several major companies.

It
 was while working in France in 1983 that he and his wife Caroline 
suffered the tragic death of his seven-month-old daughter who died in a 
car accident.

Six years later, Archbishop Welby resigned from the corporate world. Welby became Archbishop of Canterbury in February 2013 having been ordained a deacon in 1992.

According
 to Dr Atherstone: 'It is hard to tell at this distance, so it is a 
wondering - but I do wonder whether there is a connection between 
dealing with this traumatic suicide incident and then two weeks later 
recommitting his life to Christ. Is the timing just a coincidence or is 
there a connection between the two?'

Archbishop Welby spent his gap year teaching in an Anglican Missionary project in Kiburu, Kenya. He travelled to Africa aged 18 after leaving Eton in 1974 when he had to deal with the tragic suicide of one of his students

The book, Archbishop Welby: Risk-taker and Reconciler is published on June 26 cost £18.99
