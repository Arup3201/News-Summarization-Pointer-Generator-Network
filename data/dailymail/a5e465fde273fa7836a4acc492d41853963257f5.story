An African-American woman who accused Bill Cosby of rape dating back to the 1980s in November has revealed that her race weighed heavily on her decision to come forward with allegations. 

In an op-ed published on Friday, former model Jewel Allison claimed Cosby forced himself upon her after inviting her to dinner and slipping something into her wine, which made her ill.

She wrote that after other accusers came forward, she was not relieved, but instead terrified.

'As an African-American woman, I felt the stakes were even higher. Historic images of black men being vilified en masse as sexually violent sent chills through my body,' she wrote in the Washington Post. 

Allison claimed that the night of the dinner party Cosby grabbed her hand and placed it on his genitals.

'That was my sexual assault by this comedian,' she told the New York Daily News. 'He turned me around and said, "Let's get you home". At the door, he gave me a very hard embrace and a hard kiss.'

She remembers vomiting in the back seat of a cab on the way home. Cosby invited her over again but she declined.

Speaking about the alleged assault to the Daily News in November, Allison said: 'We may be looking at America's greatest serial rapist that ever got away with this for the longest amount of time.

'He got away with it because he was hiding behind the image of Cliff Huxtable.' 

But in her op-ed with the Post she said that coming forward with her story would help bring down the entertainer, but she 'feared it would undermine the entire African-American community'.

 Allison wrote that she didn't come out with her accusations earlier because she didn't want to see 'yet another African-American man vilified in the media'.

She said she didn't know if her loyalty should lie with 'women who were sexually victimized or with black America, which has been systematically victimized'. 

About three dozen women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct in incidents dating back to the 1960s. The comedian has denied all claims

Like many in America, she watched The Cosby Show, and saw the Dr Huxtable character as a 'much-needed wholesome model of success'. The image of who she saw playing the man swiftly changed on the night she claims he raped her. 

She concludes her essay by explaining that though Cosby was a source of hope for many, 'fictional icons like him should not wield so much power over our collective spirit'. 

She adds that though she feared coming forward, 'The only legacy at stake is of one entertainer, not of black manhood, as I once feared'.  

Attorneys for Cosby asked a federal court judge on Friday to dismiss a defamation suit filed against the comedian in Massachusetts by three women who said he called them liars when they accused him of sexual assault.

About three dozen women have accused Cosby, 77, of sexual misconduct in incidents dating back to the 1960s. 

The comedian has denied all the claims, most of which have seen the statute of limitations run out.
