A 20-year-old college student from upstate New York has been unfairly labeled a racist on social media after her vindictive ex-boyfriend posted vile messages in her name.

Brianna Rivera, from Middletown, New York, woke up one morning last week to discover that she has become the subject of a viral Tumblr campaign intended to get her fired for being a bigot.

But it has since been revealed that the real culprit was Rivera's ex-boyfriend, who posted a pair of racially charged status updates on his Facebook page in the woman's name.

Doppelganger: The ex changed his Facebook user name to 'Brianna Rivera' and uploaded her picture as part of the cruel prank

Fanning the flames: The jilted boyfriend wrote a pair of abhorrent, racially charged messages in Rivera's name commenting on the situation in Ferguson, Missouri 

In an order to convince other web users that the abominable posts were coming from Brianna, her ex, who goes by the user name Mallo Fox, changed the name of his account to 'Brianna Rivera' and even included her photo, Gawker first reported. 

One of the status updates written in all caps on Rivera's behalf read: 'seriously everything in Ferguson is f***ed up. We bring the black people here give them a good life and this is how they repay us. Look at Africa it's still f***ing dirty and hut and ebola ridden but they still wanna complain and not be grateful that us white people brought them here and gave them jobs.'

Around the same time, the spiteful ex wrote a second, even more shocking post referring to the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown at the hands of white Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson.

'F*** all there ape n*****s in ferguson LOL. who cares about some thug dying. that officer did what he had a right to do and thats protecting us from more loser a** mother f*****s and apes.'

The hateful messages eventually ended up on a popular Tumblr page called Racists Getting Fired.

The social media forum has been created to out Internet users who post racially charged comments to their employers in hopes of getting them sacked.

The pair of posts were accompanied by Brianna Rivera's personal details, including the town where she lives, the college she attends and her place of employment - AMC Theater at the Galleria Mall in Middletown. 

Playing with fire: The user shared the posts on the Tumblr account Racists Getting Fired in an apparent hope of getting Rivera terminated from her job as a movie theater supervisor 

'Coward': The Miami native, left and right, has since removed both his Facebook and Instagram accounts 

The web vigilantes behind the Tumblr page encouraged users to call her work and get her fired over her hate-filled remarks about Ferguson.

Before it was determined that Miss Rivera was the victim of a cruel prank, the campaign against her spread like wildfire, prompting strangers to contact Rivera's workplace and complain about her perceived bigotry.

AMC Theaters took the incident seriously and issued a statement Friday in defense of Miss Rivera.

‘AMC was made aware of some highly offensive posts that were allegedly sent from an associate,’ the statement red.

‘An immediate and thorough investigation confirmed the social media account and highly offensive posts were fabricated by someone posing as an AMC associate.

‘This hateful behavior is dangerous and illegal. A police report has been filed, and we will pursue prosecution to the fullest extent of the law against the person or persons who committed these illegal acts.’

The Racist Getting Fired Tumblr has issued a profanity-laced retraction attacking Brianna Rivera's ex-boyfriend for defaming her and asking users to stop calling her employer.

Speaking out: Miss Rivera posted a message on her real Facebook page to clear the air about the ordeal 

The ex, a Miami native living in New York City, has since deleted his Facebook and Instagram pages.

Seeking to clear her name once and for all, the 20-year-old criminal justice student also issued a statement on her real Facebook page about the unfortunate ordeal.

'I said none of those horrible words of hatred & racism. Anyone who knows me, knows I would never in my entire life say anything like that,' she wrote on Thanksgiving.

'I appreciate everyone who came to me and asked me first... And thank u everyone who is spreading the truth about it not being me....

‘And as for the person who stole my identity, defamed my character and endangered not only my life but the lives of my friends and family, thanks.'
