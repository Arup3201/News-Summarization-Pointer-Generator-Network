They were both Liberal prime ministers who rode in on large majorities, but no one would say Malcolm Fraser and Tony Abbott saw eye-to-eye at the end.  

In his final months, the late former prime minister had no qualms about telling the world just what he thought about the nation's current leader.

Mr Fraser this year posted a series of angry messages to his Twitter account where he was scathing of Mr Abbott's administration.

In one message, critical of the government's treatment of Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs, Mr Fraser said the Prime Minister was 'behaving like a dictator'. He added: 'get rid (of) Abbott'.

Passed on: Malcolm Fraser, the nation's 22nd prime minister from 1975 to 1983, was unimpressed with various aspects of Tony Abbott's administration. The former Liberal shifted considerably to the left during his time in power

Target: Mr Fraser was no fan of Mr Abbott's administration, regularly flaying him in tweets this year

In a statement on Friday afternoon, Mr Abbott was generous in his remarks about the 22nd prime minister, praising his work in establishing Australian institutions such as the Federal Police.

'Abbott dangerous to harmony, peace, a destroyer of wisdom': Mr Fraser was very critical of Mr Abbott, posting links to foreign news outlets and adding his own criticsms

'No idea of what a nation should be': Mr Fraser was never afraid to stand up for what he believed 

At various other points, he said the government 'has no idea of what a nation should be' and that Mr Abbott was 'dangerous to harmony, peace, a destroyer of wisdom'. 

In February, he remarked that Mr Abbott was steering his party 'backwards' and appeared particularly upset with the prime minister's latest thoughts about Islam.  

He posted a link to an Al Jazeera article titled 'Tony Abbott's unambiguous anti-Muslim bigotry' and added that someone had said to him it was 'reminiscent of 1930s Germany', the period before Hitler rose to power. 

In a statement on Friday afternoon, Mr Abbott was respectful in his remarks about the 22nd prime minister, praising his work in establishing Australian institutions such as the Federal Police. 

He said today was particularly sad day for those who had followed Mr Fraser's efforts to stop a 'bad government' in 1975. 

Mr Fraser's politics shifted after he left Parliament, with him resigning from the Liberal party in 2010.

Mr Abbott said he had sought Mr Fraser's wisdom in long conversations as recently as last year - but the two disagreed on several issues. 

'I had quite a number of long talks with him since then, most recently late last year,' Mr Abbott told reporters. 

'I didn't always agree with all of his positions. In fact, I often disagreed with his positions. 

'But I always appreciated his insights and the wisdom born of long experience.' 

In an interview with The Australian in 2013, Mr Fraser said he had 'never had any cross words with Tony Abbott'. But there was a catch. 

'I suppose I've said some fairly harsh things about some of his attitudes on turning the boats back.'
