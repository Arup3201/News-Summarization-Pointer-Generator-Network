A Jetstar plane has been forced to make an emergency landing after a seriously ill passenger was reportedly vomiting blood on board on Wednesday night.

A man in his 50s was greeted by paramedics and quarantine officials, including a woman wearing a white hazmat suit, at Sydney airport after the Darwin-bound flight was forced to turn back.

The hazardous materials suit,  that consists of an impermeable whole-body garment, is currently being worn by medical staff caring for Ebola patients.

'I can confirm the customer’s symptoms emerged during the aircraft’s ascent out of Sydney,' a Jetstar spokesman told Daily Mail Australia.

Nine News reported the passenger was 'vomiting blood' but a Jetstar spokesman told AAP the man was not suffering from Ebola.

'(He) was vomiting, and it was clear (he was) quite unwell,' he said.

He added that the passenger had a pre-existing medical condition that concerned the medical advisory team.

The spokesperson would not disclose the medical condition, but said it was not contagious and there is now no concern of Ebola. 

Around 140 people were on board the flight, which landed in Sydney at around 12am.

It had been in the sky for around an hour when the decision was made to turn back. 

Quarantine officials examined the plane and the man was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital for treatment.

Staff wore protective gloves as they carried the sick traveller across the tarmac on a stretcher and a bright yellow protective plastic bag was also placed on the stretcher.

Extra precautions were taken until it was determined the man had a pre-existing medical condition

Around 140 passengers had to leave the plane and some stayed in a hotel overnight

The sick men was rushed to hospital in an ambulance 

A spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'The captain made the decision to return to Sydney as the nearest diversion point after a medical situation had emerged on board. This is a standard procedure for all airlines.

'A passenger on the flight became very unwell shortly after take-off and we were quickly able to determine they had a pre-existing medical condition.

'We were advised to turn back to Sydney so the passenger could receive urgent medical treatment. Paramedics met the aircraft on arrival and the passenger was taken to hospital.'

Jetstar confirmed the plane had been forced to return to Sydney via Twitter

More than one hundred people were on board the flight. Another flight to Darwin has been scheduled for Thursday

Jetstar also tweeted: 'Confirming JQ672 returned to Sydney last night. Decision made in line with medical advice for the safety & wellbeing of the unwell passenger.'

The frightened passengers were offered hotel rooms after their flight was subsequently cancelled.

An additional Jetstar flight will run to Darwin on Thursday night.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Sydney Airport for further comment.
