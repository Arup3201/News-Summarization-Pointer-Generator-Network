Would-be killer: UCF student James Oliver Seevakumaran was planning a campus killing spree before killing himself, cops said today

A University of Central Florida student who committed suicide in his campus dorm room last night was plotting to kill classmates with improvised explosives and an assault rifle, cops said today.

James Oliver Seevakumaran, was found dead in his bedroom.

Along with his body, police also found about 200 rounds of ammunition, two guns - one a tactical assault rifle - and a backpack filled with four IEDs.

They also found writings detailing an elaborate plan to conduct an attack.

Police believe that Seevakumaran had pulled the fire alarm to get students out of their rooms and into the open.

Hundreds of students were evacuated from the dorm on the Orlando campus after the fire alarm was pulled at about 12:21am, UCF Police Chief Richard Beary told reporters during a press conference this evening.

While they were on their way to the scene, a 911 call came in about a man with a gun.

The caller was Seevakumaran's roommate, who told police that came into the room and pointed a gun at him.

Beary said that the responding officers may have caught Seevakumaran off guard, and he killed himself before putting his plan into action.

He added that Seevakumaran had not yet paid his school fees for this semester, and a process had begun to kick him out of the dorm.

He had no prior disciplinary record at UCF, but he was arrested in 2006 for misuse of a temporary tag and driving with a suspended license.

His writings indicated that he had been planning the attack since February, and had bought his weapons in an Orlando-area gunshop.

UCF spokesman Grant Heston said the dorm has suites, with a main kitchen and living area, along with four bedrooms. The dead man was inside one of the rooms.

Heston said the Orange County Sheriff's Office and the FBI are helping with the investigation.

Investigation: About 500 students were evacuated from the dorm as police examined the explosives found inside

Just after noon today, the explosives were removed from the dorm and classes resumed as scheduled.

The sheriff's bomb squad was examining the explosive devises this morning.

About 500 students were evacuated from the dorm and an adjacent parking garage was closed. Both facilities have since reopened.

The school utilized text message alerts to keep students informed about the situation.

Antonio Whitehead, 21, a junior from 
Hollywood, Florida, said he heard the fire alarm go off after midnight 
and thought it was a routine alarm.

He headed outside where he saw a crowd already heading across the street from the dorm.

'All
of a sudden, I felt the crowd move a little faster. And a police 
officer with a machine gun or something told everyone to start moving a 
lot faster,' he said.

Whitehead, who has lived in the dorm 
for two years, said the students were moved to an open area about 1,000 
feet from UCF Arena.

Grant 
Hernandez, 20, a sophomore from Orlando who also is a resident at the 
dorm, said he woke up sometime after midnight when police were 
evacuating the building.

'We weren't allowed to get our cars. We weren't allowed to get our personal effects,' Hernandez said.

'All we saw were people running, and they were not telling us what was going on,' he added.

'We were left unsure of things. It wasn't till about 6 o'clock that we got more information and a clearer picture of what was going on.'

He said officers on the scene began providing more information, and students checked updates on the university's website.

The area is a very busy section of the campus, with restaurants and shops nearby.

A statement on the university's website said the UCF Arena would open to accommodate displaced students.Â 

Counselors would be available to talk to students who need assistance.
