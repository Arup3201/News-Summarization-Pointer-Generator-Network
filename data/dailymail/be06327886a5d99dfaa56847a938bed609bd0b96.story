A man with a bizarre addiction to petrol has been caught attempting to get high on a garage forecourt.

Brian Taylor, 45, was banned from petrol stations in 2005 after slashing the pumps so that he could drink the liquid and inhale fumes.

After drinking the fuel Taylor was spotted dancing around garage forecourts high on the toxic fumes.

The holes Taylor left in the fuel lines would mean the next driver to use the pump would end up covered in petrol.

He was jailed, and given an Asbo banning him from forecourts and having petrol in public, but has repeatedly breached the order.

Taylor, from Brotton, near Middlesbrough, was arrested again after being spotted at two petrol stations on the same day - a Morrisons and a Tesco outlet, both in Redcar, north Yorkshire.

Court papers show that he was found with an open container of petrol.

He was brought before magistrates in Teesside, where he admitted the offences and was given a suspended 16-week prison term and told to pay £120 in costs.

Taylor's lawyer said that he accepted he had 'taken the drips from the petrol pumps', which she described as ''not a particularly sophisticated offence.'

The court heard that, although his history was an aggravating factor, Taylor's life was 'a lot more settled than it has been in recent years' and he was attending appointments with the probation service.

When he was first convicted it emerged that Taylor had tried to attend meetings to fix his problem, but smelled so strongly of petrol that he was deemed a fire hazard and told to leave.

At the sentencing on New Year's Eve, the chairman of the Teesside magistrates said it was disappointing to see him in court again, and that he was close to being sent back to prison.

He said: 'You put one foot wrong now and you are going to go away.'

The lethal practice of sniffing petrol and other volatile substances, such as glue kills as many as 50 people a year, and is especially prevalent in children.

According to anti-abuse charity Re-Solv, sniffing volatile substances is the most common type of substance mis-use among children aged 10 and 11.

Those who use petrol to get high are taking their life in their hands, as ‘sudden sniffing death syndrome’ can kill after just one use, and is estimated to take at least 50 lives a year.

LOST, another solvent abuse charity, reported that dozens of people who suffered from petrol addiction were calling their helpline.

A spokesman said: ‘The chemicals in the petrol, such as butane, give them a buzz which lasts ten to 20 minutes and then they try again when it wears off. They don’t realise that the first time can kill them.’

Petrol abuse has long been a big problem in South America and Australia, where it is much more widespread than in the UK.

In 2006 BP rolled out an odourless petrol called Opal in aboriginal Australia to prevent residents using it to get high.
