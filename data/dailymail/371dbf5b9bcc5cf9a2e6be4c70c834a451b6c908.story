The son of a 46-year-old man who was killed last year has been charged with his father's murder after a former private school girl turned drug addict was charged over a first attempt on Michael Martin Senior's life.

Michael Martin Junior made a public appeal last Sunday to find Mr Martin Snr's killers.

But in a bizarre twist, his son will now face court on Monday charged with his June murder.

Michael Martin Junior made a public appeal to find Michael Martin Senior's killers last Sunday

Jessica Honey Fallon (pictured left in 2011 and right in a police mugshot from 2014), from Byron Bay in New South Wales, was charged with attempted murder over Mr Martin Snr's first attack in April

New South Wales police are alleging the 25-year-old killed Mr Martin Snr to cash in millions of dollars worth of life insurance, News Corp reported.

Martin Jnr is thought to have bought the policy just weeks before his father died.

It follows the arrest of Jessica Honey Fallon, 21, who was charged over the first attempt on Mr Martin Snr's life back in April.

Police claim Fallon and two other people were paid to break into the 46-year-old's home, and then stabbed him and assaulted one of his friends who was staying the night in his South Murwillumbah unit on New South Wales' north coast. 

Michael 'Mullet Mick' Martin survived the alleged hit on his life but was killed two months later in a brutal attack at his home in South Murwillumbah on the NSW's north coast

Mr Martin Snr - who was known to locals as 'Mullet Mick' - survived the attack but during the second he was not so lucky. 

It was the 46-year-old's first night home after his lengthy stay in hospital when he was killed.

An axe was found at the scene. 

Details of Fallon's life have been revealed, with police claiming she had descended into a life of drugs and crime following her private school upbringing.

Pictures of the 21-year-old, taken just three years apart, show the toll her alleged drug use had taken on her body.

Fallon's case was heard at Parramatta Local Court in February.

Police have ruled out her involvement in the fatal attack on Mr Martin Snr. 

Fallon was charged with attempted murder and assault occasioning grievous bodily harm for the attack on Mr Martin Snr in April, 9News reported. 

Mr Martin was killed on the night he arrived home after spending a lengthy stint in hospital recovering from April's attempt on his life

Now Martin Jnr will face Tweed Heads Local Court on Monday following a Sunday hearing in Lismore Local Court, just a week after he made an emotional plea to the public to find his father's killers.

It was initially reported by media Martin Jnr was tied up and beaten before he witnessed Mr Martin Snr's death.

During his public appeal, Martin Jnr said he was scared for his life.

'All I can remember is hearing the death of my father. It was just terrifying,' he told 9News.

'I never expected I'd see my wife or children again.

'When dad got assaulted the first time we spent countless hours in hospital thinking that was going to be our last night with him.

'We just got him out, we just got him better. I was just trying to help him make a new start.' 

Tweed-Byron crime manager Detective Inspector Brendon Cullen confirmed police were still investigating the first assault on Mr Martin and any relationship between Fallon and Mr Martin.

The weekend's arrest was the culmination of a 'long and complex' investigation.

'It's taken many hours of tireless effort by our detectives to come up with this result,' Det Insp Cullen told reporters.
