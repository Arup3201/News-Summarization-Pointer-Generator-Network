Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was in direct contact with President Barack Obama at least 18 times between October 2012 and October 2013, including seven occasions where her draft calendar showed Obamacare as the topic of conversation.

The news appears to contradict her insistence that Obama was in the dark about problems plaguing the ill-fated healthcare.gov website in the months leading up to its October 1, 2013 launch.

The Hill newspaper reported Thursday that documents released through a Freedom of Information Act request show meetings, events and phone calls where the two were together.

They also show at least three breakfast or lunch meetings with close Obama adviser Pete Rouse, along with scheduled calls or meetings with presidential confidante Valerie Jarrett and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has tried to insulate the president from criticism about the healthcare.gov launch, including falling on her sword during a December 11 congressional hearing

Obama has been insistent that while some bumps in the road were to be expected, he was not aware of how bad the healthcare website would be

The Obamacare website was plagued with crashes, unscheduled outages and slow response times in its first months online, causing the White House to recruit former administration official Jeff ZIents to turn it around.

Throughout, Sebelius insulated the Oval Office from criticism about how the website's expensive building and disastrous unveiling were handled.

During an October 22, 2013 interview on CNN, host Sanjay Gupta asked Sebelius whether or not Obama knew of the problems behind the scenes.

'No, sir,' she replied.

Three weeks later, Obama denied getting a heads-up about the online disaster that would soon come.

'On the website,' he said in a Nov. 14 press conference, 'I was not informed directly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to. Had I been informed, I wouldn’t be going out saying, boy, this is going to be great.'

Five days later on Nov. 19, he told a Wall Street Journal reporter during the paper's CEO Summit that 'we probably underestimated the complexities of building out a website that needed to work the way it should.'

That use of the first person pronoun 'we' is now attracting new scrutiny.

Website visitors got error messages -- when they could reach it at all -- during October and November, greatly hampering the administration's ability to meet its enrollment goals

'We should have anticipated that would create a rockier rollout than if Democrats and Republicans were both invested in success,; he added.

Online registrations for Obamacare-linked private health insurance plans has grown to 3.3 million nationwide, according to numbers released by HHS on Wednesday, giving the White House some much-needed ammunition against critics.

But the Obama administration still steadfastly refused to comment on how many Americans, or how few, have paid their premiums.

A MailOnline analysis found that in five states where such statistics have been made public, just 66 per cent overall have made their first month's payment – suggesting that 2.2 million, a smaller number, are likely insured.

But a survey conducted by McKinsey & Co. found that just 11 per cent of people who have enrolled in private insurance through Obamacare marketplaces were uninsured before they signed up. 

That indicates that the Affordable Care Act may have enrolled fewer than 250,000 people who didn't have insurance before.

The Obama administration has said its goal is to enroll 7 million people by the end of March.
