Tiny diamonds thought to be 4.3billion years old were actually remnants of polishing grit, left when zircon crystals were being prepared for laboratory testing, scientists have found.

The gemstones, found in cracks inside the crystals, were believed to have been the oldest known diamonds found in terrestrial rocks when they were first reported on in journal Nature in 2007.

However, it has now emerged that the miniscule stones were in fact a paste which had been rubbed into tiny cracks in the zircons, found in Jack Hills, western Australia, when they were cleaned for tests.

Scientists at the University of California, Riverside, realised the error when they used a powerful emission electron microscope to photograph the 'diamonds', according to a study published in the February edition of the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters.

They noticed that instead of the rough-edges associated with real diamonds, these were in fact sharp-edged synthetic diamonds found in polishing paste.

Authors of the 2007 study, who provided their samples for testing, have agreed with the findings by lead author Larissa Dobrzhinetskaya and UCR research geophysicist Harry Green, according to Live Science.

Zircon crystals as old as 4.4billion years were discovered inside 3billion old sedimentary rocks at Jack Hills in the 1980s, which showed evidence of Earth's early continents as the older zircons must have washed into the rock.

In 2007 the international team, headed by geochemist Martina Menneken from Germany, reported that diamonds, most of which were only just wider than a human hair and aged between 4.3billion and 3.1billion years, had been found inside the crystals from Jack Hills.

The existence of the gemstones was thought to be evidence that a thick continental crust had already formed during the Earth's early years, as the surface would have to be cool enough for diamonds to form.

The presence of the diamonds backed up theories surrounding early continental drift, as plate tectonics, which also cause volcanoes, would have created enough pressure for the diamonds to form

Their presence also backed up theories surrounding early continental drift, as plate tectonics would have created enough pressure for the diamonds to form.

However, some scientists were suspicious of the findings due to the fact that the zircons had been cleaned using diamond paste, and found it difficult to believe that diamonds with an age range of more than one billion years could have been found within individual zircons.

After receiving permission to test the zircons, Professor Dobrzhinetskaya and her team found that the diamonds were more similar to angular synthetic diamonds, rather than a natural form.

The crystals were also surrounded by minerals which made up the polishing compound and resin used to clean the zircons.

Co-author of the 2007 study, Thorsten Geisler-Wierwille, accepts that polishing paste had found its way into the zircons, but maintains that there could be diamonds embedded in the core of the crystals.

However, Professor Green disagrees. 'They can go back to their cache of Jack Hill zircons and make new specimens,' he told Live Science.

'If you're a betting person, I'll make you a bet that they won't find it. There have been an enormous amount of (Jack Hills) zircons analyzed in a bunch of different ways, and no one has ever found diamonds.'
