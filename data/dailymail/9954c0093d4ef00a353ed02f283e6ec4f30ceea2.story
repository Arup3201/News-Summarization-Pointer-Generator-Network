John Prescott has suggested the rise in radicalised teenagers is down to Tony Blair 'wanting to invade everywhere'.

The former Labour deputy prime minister claimed it was unsurprising that young Muslims were turning to extremism when they switch on the television to see 'more rockets being fired' in the Middle East.

The comments were made at a fundraising event in Gainsborough on February 19 for Lord Prescott's son David. 

They come amid an increasing anxiety about the number of young students fleeing to the Middle East to fight for ISIS.

The 76-year-old said: 'I was with Tony Blair on Iraq. We were wrong. They told us it wasn't regime change. It was.

'Now Tony, unfortunately is still in to that. I mean the way he's going now, he now wants to invade everywhere.

'He should put a white coat on with a red cross and let's start the bloody crusades again. 

'Every time [people] watch the television where their families are worried, their kids are being killed and murdered and rockets firing on all these people, that's what radicalises them.'

The event was just days before Ed Miliband announced Lord Prescott would be joining the Labour party as a special adviser on climate change, the Daily Telegraph reported. 

The decision to call on  Prescott ahead of the general election has be seen by some as an attempt to turn the clock back to when Labour used to win elections.

The move was backed by Alastair Campbell, Blair's former spin doctor, who also pledged to join the effort to get Miliband elected.

It is not the first time Prescott has launched an offensive against Blair.

In his memoirs he claims he called the former prime minister a 'little s***' during a blazing argument.

He has similarly criticised Blair in the past for justifying regime change and using political force during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

He wrote in a Mirror column last year: 'This is totally unacceptable and provokes people in communities angry about the West's actions.

'I challenged Tony about the danger of becoming involved with what Bush ­acknowledged was a crusade.'

Bob Neill, the Conservative vice-chairman, said Prescott's latest comments show Labour has not changed.

He said: 'Their bitter divisions would cause chaos for Britain if they got into Government.'

A Labour spokesman said: 'John's views on this do not represent the views of the Labour Party.'
