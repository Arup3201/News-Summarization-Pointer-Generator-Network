At every Aintree meet there are always runners, riders and the inevitable fallers - and this year was no different.

And as the glammed up girls of Liverpool entered the pen for Ladies' Day in bolder dresses, thicker lashes and deeper tans than yesterday, there were some who did not even make it past the first hurdle.

With more than 50,000 people in attendance, but the combination of killer heels and free-flowing champagne proved to be a bad one for some who took a
tumble before the off.

Ouch! A racegoer in a peach dress and sky high heels takes a painful-looking tumble

Fortunately both these ladies had knights in shining armour, or suits at least, who could pick them up and keep them on their feet

Careful: Staying upright in such a long flowing dress can't have been easy, left, while another lady makes gathers her belongings back into her purse, right

Helping hand: A struggling racegoer looks to be in need of some assistance after ending up on her back at Aintree

What's his excuse? Even some of the gents at Aintree can't stay on their feet it seems

Whoops! As the alcohol flows one unfortunate girl comes a cropper ... but it's ok, her friend manages to save her spilled WKD

Here come the girls: A gaggle of good-looking friends arrive at the racecourse ahead of the day's actvities

Technicolour dream: This group dressed up their block-coloured outfits with statement accessories and extreme hair

Young women show off their fascinators and blow-dries as they soak up the atmosphere at the event

Victoria Meekings of Harvey Nichols, which stages a beauty bazaar at the racecourse, said the bitterly cold 
winds around Merseyside were unlikely to encourage 
women racegoers to wrap up.

'At the end of the day the girls are here to show off their fabulous 
outfits so I think they'll be braving the elements,' she said.

'Aintree is a fantastic place to see what's trending and where the big labels are scoring hits with the public.

'It's real fashion theatre to see all the ladies dressed up in their heels and their dresses.

'Tomorrow is Ladies' Day and it is very exciting as we wait and see what people are going to wear.

'Liverpool girls always pull out all the stops and Ladies' Day at the 
Grand National is important to them so it's going to be a tremendous 
day.'

Size matters: 6 inch platform heels are the footwear of chioce for most of the girls

Well-groomed: The Liverpool One shopping centre sold 2,000litres of fake tan ahead of the racing event

Pink ladies: Hot pink was a hot trend of the on a lace prom dress, a jersey maxi dress and even a fur-trimmed cape

True blue: One blonde reveals a little more than expected in a navy jumpsuit, head-to-toe turquoise makes a statement and electric blue lace is worn with a wool shawl

Pale pink gingham checks and a lemon jersey maxi dress are pure summer, but looks like one poor racing fan left her skirt at home

Regular Aintree favourite Coleen 
Rooney, 27, who is eight months pregnant, tweeted her disappointment at 
not being able to attend today's festivities.

The
wife of Manchester United and England star Wayne Rooney, said on the 
social network: 'First time in 10 years am not getting ready for Ladies 

Day!!! Gonna miss it!! Have fun everybody!!!!'

Atomic
Kitten star Liz McClarnon, 31, arrived at the racecourse with friends 
and wearing a cream Philip Armstrong floral design dress with a Dawn

Wiggins hat made from a copy of the Daily Mirror.

She said: 'I love Ladies' Day, for me it's the highlight of the Grand National.

'I love getting dressed up, I love the glamour, I absolutely love it.

'There is a bit of competition between the girls, especially in terms of the hats, but it's a good-natured competition.

'We're all here to dress up and have a laugh and a lovely time with our friends.'

Birds, flowers and feathers make-up one elaborate headpiece while the more lightweight hats offer little protection from the elements

Sky high: Heels of every colour were on display, mostly worn with bare, very brown legs

Flower power: Some rather stand-out shoes make a statement

Stars of MTV's reality show The Valleys drew attention in jaw-dropping outfits each made from the Welsh Flag.

Nicole Morris, Carley Belmonte, Lateysha Grace and Natalee Harris wore designs by friend Clydeus.

Carley, 21, said: 'This is the first time I've ever been to the races so I'm just so happy.

'I love my dress, we decided to pull out all the stops for today.'

Commenting on the other fashions on display, Lateysha, 20, added: 'I think we've stole the show to be honest.

'We're going to have a brilliant day and I think we'll be pretty legless tonight - I don't care whether it's a posh do or not.'

Dressing for the occasion: Most of the female racegoers chose glamorous cocktail dresses or evening gowns teamed with giant clutch bags

Party dresses: Prom dresses in every colour featuring piles of netting and accessorized with killer  heels and pints

Coordinating: These girls have matched their drinks to their pretty pink outfits

Double trouble: Two women dress for the weather in fur coats and gloves (left) amd bold prints are a big summer trend (right)  ... while finishing off the look with a Matalan carrier bag isn't

Hat's the way to dress for Ladies Day: Black headgear is a hit with racegoers and orange dresses to match the fake tans are proving popular on day two of the meet

Giddy up! A couple of enthusiastic racegoers get into the spirit towards the end of the day. Right: Va-va-voom! Did this red lace creation distract the riders?

Monochrome madness: Two girls focus their fashion on a graphic theme while another, right, looks to have had a great day out

In the pink: A bottle of bubbly and some very high spirits

There go the girls: Hometime for the glammed-up crowd - or maybe a night on the tiles beckons?

Organiser of the event's Matalan 
style contest who offer £5,000 cash and a photo shoot with sponsors 
Matalan for the best-dressed racegoers said: Teresa Potts said: 
'Monochrome is going to be huge this year. We've 
also got some fluorescent colours and bright colours on display.

'Style-wise we're looking at a lot of fitted shapes, very much copying the Victoria Beckham look.

'For the men, it's going to be traditional, smart tailored suits inspired by Daniel Craig in Skyfall.'

Yesterday temperatures at Sefton Park only manged to peak at 10C, although the wind 
made it feel much colder, forecasters said, and it will be little comfort to the women in chiffon that better weather is on its way - next
week.

John Lee, a forecaster with 
Meteogroup, said: ‘Looking ahead there are signs [the cold weather] will
break down next week and we’ll see a return to slightly milder 
conditions.

‘The average temperature [for this time of year] is about 13C and there are signs of that next week.

‘Compared to what we have had, that will feel quite nice but it will be accompanied by some rain.’

The icy winds yesterday weren't enough to deter 
racegoers such Beth Jones, 39, from 
Walton, Liverpool, who wore a strapless red dress with four-inch heels, 
admitted: ‘I wish I had bought a fur coat. If I stand out here much 
longer I will turn into an icicle.’

Today’s feature race is the 
two-and-a-half-mile John Smith’s Melling Chase and punters piling in to 
Aintree will get a glimpse of a true superstar.

Sprinter
Sacre, unbeaten in eight steeplechase runs and fresh from a 19-length 
demolition of Sizing Europe at last month’s Cheltenham Festival,  was a 
best-priced 4/11 this morning.

Flemenstar
and Cue Card are poised to provide the biggest threats to the Nicky 
Henderson-trained seven-year-old Mad Moose goes in the same race and 
you’d need to be crazy to back the Nigel Twiston-Davies runner – 
available at 250/1.

Brunch: Two girls hit one of the racecourse's many bars to warm up before the racing starts

The girls from MTV show The Valleys used the event to promote their show (and create some gobsmackingly bad outfits out of Welsh flags)

Down the hatch: The Valleys girls prepare for their big night out. 'We don't care if it's not posh!' they said

Ready to give Coleen a run for her money?
