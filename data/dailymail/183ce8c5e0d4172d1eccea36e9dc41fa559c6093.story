The All Blacks rolled into Cardiff on Sunday night with a simple message for Wales: we’re coming at you fully loaded.

Head coach Steve Hansen has promised to select his strongest side for the Test at the Millennium Stadium after a second-string New Zealand line-up scraped to victory over Scotland on Saturday.

Wales have not beaten the Kiwis since 1953 and Hansen is plotting to extend the 25-match winning run against a side low on confidence after their uninspiring 17-13 win over Fiji. ‘We’ll look to pick the best team we can to counter what Wales will bring,’ said Hansen.

‘We will try and pick the best players we’ve got to do that. Wales are a good side. I’m not sure why they’re ranked where they are; I think they should be ranked higher.

‘They finished fourth at the World Cup and all they’ve done since then is improve their team. They’ve got big wingers and a big back three. Their midfield is strong and there aren’t too many bigger than (Jamie) Roberts.’

The southern hemisphere giants received a far more high-profile welcome in Cardiff than Wales’ previous opponents, with television cameras and eager supporters waiting outside their city-centre hotel to catch a glimpse of Richie McCaw, Dan Carter and Sonny Bill Williams.

It was a stark contrast to Fiji’s reception in the Welsh capital and an indication of the huge step up in performance required if Warren Gatland’s side are going to emerge from this weekend’s Test with their credibility in tact.

Wales conceded a staggering 22 turnovers against the South Sea Islanders on Saturday and such poor ball retention against New Zealand will be punished.

This weekend’s showdown has already been dubbed ‘Black Saturday’ and Wales have to make exponential improvements if they are going to avoid an embarrassing defeat in Cardiff.

Luke Charteris says if Wales improve their accuracy they can force an unlikely victory over the visitors

Returning skipper Sam Warburton will need to be at his inspirational best but team-mate Luke Charteris believes an unlikely victory is not out of the question.

‘Against Fiji, they are always going to grab the ball and are capable of scoring some great tries,’ said Charteris.

‘A lot of boys who played last week said this game felt harder. It was just accuracy and, against New Zealand, we know if they turn the ball over they will score. One thing we will work on this week is retaining the ball. If we do that, then we are capable of beating New Zealand.’

Poor performances from Gatland’s fringe players have made some calls easier than others ahead of Monday’s team announcement. But the most difficult decisions rest on the selection of Liam Williams and Richard Hibbard at full back and hooker.

Williams made 224 metres — three times more than any of his team-mates — on Saturday but now faces competition from Leigh Halfpenny, who is hoping to be back in contention after suffering concussion against Australia.

In the pack, Gatland must decide whether to wield the axe over hooker Hibbard. The Gloucester forward is caught in the crossfire of a club-versus-country row, having shunned medical advice from the Wales team doctor to feature in Friday night’s defeat by Harlequins.

His boots were filled on Saturday by Ospreys debutant Scott Baldwin, whose afternoon started well with a dominant performance at the line-out, but fell apart as Fiji launched a comeback in the second half.

Despite having Campese Ma’afu sent off in the 53rd minute, the tourists almost snatched victory with a showing inspired by 20st 2lb centre Nemani Nadolo.

The Crusaders goliath will be hoping to continue his incredible scoring record — which now stands at 13 tries in 15 Tests — at next year’s World Cup.

Fiji have become the forgotten team of the pool stages, but scrum-half Nikola Matawalu has warned the bigger nations to write-off the underdogs at their peril.

‘We are in the pool of death with England, Wales, Australia and Uruguay,’ said Matawalu.

‘It will be hard but it will be immense. We come over here and we play the next day. If we can have time, like a month, then we can make a difference in that pool. Any team can beat any team, so it is open.’
