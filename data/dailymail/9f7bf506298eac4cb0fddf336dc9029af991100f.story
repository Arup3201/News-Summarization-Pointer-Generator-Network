Accused: Court clerk David Kelly is charged with perverting the course of justice by helping drivers escape penalty points in return for cash

A rogue court clerk was allegedly paid thousands of pounds by motorists who wanted to avoid driving bans in an illegal scam organised under magistrates' noses.

Clerical assistant David Kelly, 47, is accused of operating the racket for six years. In that time he allegedly helped 71 drivers remove details of convictions, disqualifications and penalty points on 110 occasions.

A court heard motorists would hand over cash to have their licences 'cleaned' of offences such as speeding or using a mobile phone at the wheel.

Jurors were told the deals were done through 'middlemen' and, once the money was received, forms were sent from the court to the DVLA, requesting the convictions be deleted.

The alleged scam at Liverpool  magistrates’ court, described as an open secret in the city, was eventually uncovered when officials at the DVLA became suspicious about the number of forms they were receiving from the court.

Kelly, who lives with his wife Carol in Liverpool, had been working in the administration department at the magistrates’ court for around 20 years.

As part of his responsibilities he would sometimes contact the DVLA to update records.

He allegedly carried out the scam by forging forms to ‘falsely claim’ that Liverpool magistrates had removed or quashed the convictions.

Jonathan Sandiford, prosecuting, told 
Preston Crown Court: ‘Between 2004 and 2010 the Crown says that Kelly 
abused his position to  unlawfully procure the removal from drivers’ 
records maintained by the DVLA the details of convictions, penalty 
points and disqualifications against more than 70 people.

'The Crown says
the only sensible motive for Kelly’s actions that jeopardised his 
employment and exposed him to the risk of criminal prosecution was 
financial gain.’

Kelly was joined by four of his alleged ‘customers’ in the dock. Mark Camello, 33, Samantha Evans, 25, Shaun Robinson, 24 and Terence Nash, 27, who all deny perverting the course of justice. Evans denies an additional charge of fraud.

Evans is alleged to have paid Kelly to have two points removed from her licence because she had accrued nine points and was at risk of losing it.

It is claimed she also used the scam to defraud her insurance company to obtain cheaper cover by failing to disclose additional points on her licence that were subsequently removed.

The DVLA first became suspicious of Kelly in September 2008 when he sent a fax to the organisation containing a number of bogus forms.

Officials raised their concerns with court management and Kelly was subjected to two 'fact finding' interviews. His explanations were accepted and he continued in his job, the court heard.

But in April 2010, Kelly was allegedly caught after court staff discovered a number of driving licences, bogus forms and faxes that had been disposed of in a confidential waste sack.

The court was told that most of the recovered documents were linked to Kelly by fingerprinting and handwriting evidence.

Further evidence was allegedly found in Kelly’s desk and at his home during a police raid.

Earlier this year nine motorists involved in the scam were jailed for a total of six years and three months. Another two were spared prison. All admitted perverting the course of justice.

Kelly has pleaded not guilty to 23 counts of conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice.

The trial continues.
