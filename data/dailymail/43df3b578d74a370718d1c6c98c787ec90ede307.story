The Iranian pop star Googoosh has released a music video which champions LGBT rights.

The 63-year-old singer, whose real name is Faegheh Atashin, posted a music video for her love song, Behesht (Heaven) on her Facebook page on Valentine’s Day, featuring a lesbian couple.

The ex-patriate Iranian star is immensely popular among Iranians of all ages and is one of the first high-profile Iranians to advocate for LGBT rights.

Iranian pop star Googoosh released a love song, Behesht, the music video shows a lesbian couple in love and has a pro-LGBT message

The music video for the song is shot from the point of view of an unseen person who turns out to be the woman's lesbian partner

The song’s music video, shows a young woman being interacting with her unseen partner, who proposes to her, gives her tickets to a Googoosh concert, gets harassed by a group of men at a train station and meets the woman’s father who does not approve of the relationship.

At the end of the video it is revealed that the couple are both women, played by Iranian actresses Pegah Ferydoni and Yasmine Azadi.

'Don't tell me to run away from love. You couldn't do it, I could not too. We could not go back to where we were,' sings Googoosh.

The music video, which has been widely shared on social media, concludes with the women holding hands and the caption ‘Freedom to love for all’.

The director of the video, Navid Akhavan, told the Guardian: ‘We knew from the start that because of its topic the video is going to be very controversial among Iranians, that's why we expected negative feedback too, but that hasn't bothered me, nor Googoosh.’

Homosexuality is illegal in Iran. Men who are convicted of homosexuality can be sentenced to death. Women are sentenced to be lashed, but if they are convicted four times, they can be executed on the fourth occasion.

In 2012, an Iranian cleric, Ayatollah Abdollah Javadi-Amoli, said in a speech that homosexuals were inferior to dogs and pigs and blamed them for spread of AIDS, reported the Guardian.

'Don't tell me to run away from love': Googoosh is one of the first high-profile Iranians to come out in favour of LGBT rights

Hostility" In the video the couple face opposition. Homosexuality is illegal in Iran and those convicted of it can be sentenced to death

In the video the couple are bashed by a group of men at a train station, which is reflective of some of the violence and stigmatisation that gay individuals face in Iran

The Behesht video has been denounced by various websites in the country. Khabar Online labelled the video obscene and said it aimed to promote ‘hideous’ acts. Enghelab News said Googoosh was ‘anti-revolutionary’ and that the video was produced to spread decadence in Iranian society.

However, many Iranian people have responded to the video with enthusiasm.

‘The reactions we have seen so far have been tremendous,’ said director Navid Akhavan. ‘The comments I have read online and the messages I have received from people within the Iranian LGBT community have brought tears to my eyes.’

The Iranian LGBT community posted the video on their Facebook page, with the excited caption:

‘Googoosh… the most famous Iranian female singer supports equal love in her new music video!!! There are different reactions towards this video so far. Lots of appreciations by Iranians, and lots of hatred as well. But we just can say BRAVO for risking your fame and doing such thing for kinda the first time in history of Iranian/Persian music.’

Googosh rose to prominence before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. After the revolutions she remained in Iran, though she did not perform in public due to a ban on female singers.

She revived her career when she left Iran in 2000 and she has lived in exile since then, it is believed in Los Angeles.

Googoosh travels around the world performing to sold-out houses in European and U.S. cities with large Iranian populations.

She also has a television show, Googoosh Academy, an X Factor style show on Manoto 1, a London-based channel run by Iranian exiles.

The music video finishes with the women at a Googoosh concert hearing her perform Behesht, the audience sees that the couple are both women
