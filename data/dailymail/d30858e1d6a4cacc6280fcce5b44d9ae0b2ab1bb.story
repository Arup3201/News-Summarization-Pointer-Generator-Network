Throughout history, dogs have constantly impressed humans with their intelligence.

From guiding blind people around to sniffing out criminals, they are able to turn to a variety of tasks with ease.

And as these astonishing pictures show, two-year-old Arbor is following in that proud tradition.

Artist: Arbor the Dog - which was rescued from the streets of Las Vegas by an animal shelter - is a talented painter - with some of her work fetching nearly £300 each

The pet - which was rescued from the streets of Las Vegas by an animal shelter - is a talented painter - with some of her work fetching nearly £300 each.

Bryce and Jennifer Henderson decided to take Arbor in from the animal shelter  - but they had no idea they were adopting a canine artist. 

Mr Henderson said: 'When we tell people our dog paints, you can tell many of them don't quite grasp the concept.

'They think she uses her paw or her tail, then we show them video of her painting in action and their jaws drop and they say "Oh my gosh, your dog paints".

Clever: Mr and Mrs Henderson said they could see straight away how intelligent Arbor was

'Neither one of us are artists so we had to learn about the craft as Arbor became interested in it.'We were just looking for a companion and had no idea how much Arbor would change our lives.

'We saw right away how intelligent Arbor was, picking up tricks with ease and mastering them. My wife decided to try something a little more challenging, painting.

'With lots of positive reinforcement she learned to take the brush in her mouth, walk to the canvas and brush back and forth at just the right distance to make beautiful strokes.

'Since then she has only improved, becoming more creative with her strokes and picking up the brush on her own.'

Arbor has since performed live on television and before audiences at fundraising events. She even painted in front of the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.

Proud: Arbor is pictured with a completed painting

Mr Henderson said the money from Arbor's paintings goes towards helping other animals in need.

 'Arbor sells most of her paintings to raise money for animals in need across the country.

'Her highest selling painting fetched $453 - around £300 - with 100 percent of the net proceeds going to an animal charity in North Carolina. We sell most of her paintings via eBay, in an auction format.

'It takes her about 10-15 minutes to complete a piece. Although she loves painting she only creates a piece once a month.'
