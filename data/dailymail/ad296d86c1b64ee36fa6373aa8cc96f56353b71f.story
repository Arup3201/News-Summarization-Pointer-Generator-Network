With 11.9million people tuning in to find out who killed Lucy Beale, last night's episode of EastEnders brought an end to months of speculation. 

And as 11-year-old Bobby was unmasked as his half-sister's killer, thousands took to social media to express their shock and awe at the plot's outcome. 

But impatient viewers weren't the only ones kept in the dark as producers worked towards unveiling the killer's identity. 

Among the last people to find out was the 'killer' himself, with the actor playing murderous Bobby Beale only told of his role in the saga on Monday.

The actor playing Bobby Beale was left in the dark about the murderous 11-year-old's storyline until just three days before the dramatic semi-live episode 

Elliot Carrington, 12, was sworn to secrecy after being told of the twist just days before last night's episode. 

The actor, who has starred in Billy Elliot, Casualty and a host of TV adverts, was seen leaving the EastEnders set with a woman thought to be his mother shortly after the episode last night.  

Even his onscreen victim was left out of the loop, discovering Bobby's role as her murderer just hours before the nationwide audience. 

Speaking after show last night, Hettie Bywater, the actor who played Lucy, said: 'I was so shocked, I found out seven or eight hours ago.

'I had no idea. We've all been speculating a little bit, everyone was pushing towards Peter. I was completely wrong.' 

The revelation came after 10 months of precise planning and script-writing, with executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins thinking up the sinister plot a year ago. 

'We've been looking over our shoulders for months and known who killed Lucy for about a year,' he said in a Q&A with series producer Sharon Batten last night.

The revelation is the start of a larger story line surrounding the Beales, producers said. Above, Ian Beale in last night's dramatic episode 

'Most people didn't know, we had to keep it quiet because things leak. I always say that if you're told a secret you tell at least one person and we just couldn't have afforded that. 

'We told Bobby on Monday. But we had told his Dad before that to check that it was OK of course, then we told him. 

'Eliot (Carrington) is so clever though that when we told him he said: "Oh that makes sense!"' 

Producers considered only one other outcome for the plot, reverting to Bobby as the murderer almost immediately. 

'There was one other suspect for about a day and it didn't feel right.

'The story had to come from the heart and with this it's the start of a whole big new story for the Beales.' 

Mr Treadwell-Collins added he hoped viewers had enjoyed the year of suspense and not found it too frustrating. 

'People want that surprise, you don't get it  much these days so people want to be surprised.

'We want to be surprised watching telly too, that's what we've tried to do.'
