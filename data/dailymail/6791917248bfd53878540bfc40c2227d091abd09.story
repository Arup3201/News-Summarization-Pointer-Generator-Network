A champion wakeboarder has spoken for the first time since an horrific training accident left him quadriplegic.

Talking through a speaking valve from his Florida hospital bed, Brad Smeele, 27, thanked his supporters for their donations and good wishes and celebrated being able to talk for the first time in a month.

The New Zealander shattered his C4 vertebrae in July while attempting a double backflip during training at the world's largest wake park Lake Ronix in Orlando, Florida.

'I just wanted to send a message out and say thank you so much for all the support and all the kind messages you guys have been sending through,' Mr Smeele said in a video posted to YouTube. 

'All the donation and gifts and everything has been really amazing and it's truly blown me away how much support I've got from all around the world so just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone.

'I'm really stoked to let you guys know that tomorrow morning I'm actually off to Atlanta to go to the Shepherd Rehab Centre so onto stage two of this battle so I'll keep you guys updated.'

Mr Smeele will spend roughly six weeks at the Atlanta rehabilitation facility to help adjust to life as a quadriplegic, his sister Monique Smeele said.

Before his accident he was ranked 20th in the US Pro Wakeboard Tour - the largest professional wakeboarding circuit in the world

'Apparently they work them pretty hard, which Brad is pretty keen on,' Ms Smeele told Daily Mail Australia.

'He's been in the ICU for a month so he wants to get out, that's the type of person he is.'

Following the accident and the injury to his spinal cord, Mr Smeele was told there was only a one to two percent chance he would regain motor skills to the top half of his body - a fact he is taking day by day.

'He's been incredible throughout this. He has dealt with it much better than I thought he would,' Ms Smeele said.

'It's a situation you don't wish upon anyone, but Brad has been really strong and positive. He's going to do whatever he has to in order to have the best life possible going forward.'

Since the operation he has regained sensation from his nipple-line up, and has been able to move his shoulders slightly.

Mr Smeele has spent the past five weeks recovering in Orlando Regional Medical Center. He has been building up the ability to breathe without the aid of a ventilator while also battling an ongoing pneumonia infection.

The keen wake boarder has split his time between New Zealand and the US for the past 10 years to follow the pro season.

Mr Smeele was working at the Florida wake park as a manager when the tragic accident occurred.

On Saturday a fundraising event held in his hometown of Auckland raised almost $NZ30,000 ($A27,381) – but this is only a small part of what is needed. Just six months of rehabilitation is estimated to cost US$500,000.

His family created a website to document his recovery and to help raise money for his care.

'We're focusing on raising enough money for his rehabilitation... that's where he's going to have the best chance possible moving forward,' Ms Smeele said.

'We'll try to pay for medical bills through other avenues.'

Brad's mother Linda Smeele thanked all her son's supporters in a Facebook post last month but described his recovery as an 'agonisingly slow process'.

'I feel like I am in 'groundhog day', treading the same path to be by my son's bedside every day, with what seems like little or no change,' she said.

'We keep reminding ourselves this is a marathon, not a sprint, and your combined love and support will help him for the remainder to his marathon.

'I am grieving for the loss of the active life Brad had, and challenged by the unknown of what lies ahead.

'But we know he is strong and determined and he will be an inspiration!'

Following the accident his girlfriend Talor Reazin posted a picture of him to Instagram along with a message of support.

'I love this boy with all my (heart). He was badly injured doing the one thing he loves most - wakeboarding,' Ms Reazin wrote.

'He is one of the most kind-hearted, hard working, gentle souls I know and is always positive with a bright happy smile on his face.'

Mr Smeele has been wakeboarding since he was 12 and has won titles at wakeboard championships around the world.

Before his accident he was ranked 20th in the US Pro Wakeboard Tour - the largest professional wakeboarding circuit in the world.
