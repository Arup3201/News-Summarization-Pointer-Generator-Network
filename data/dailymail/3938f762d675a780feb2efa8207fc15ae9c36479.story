A former Culver City High School student has alleged she was raped by three members of the football team, who videoed the attack and shared it among friends.

The student, identified only as 'A.S', has filed a lawsuit against the California school district and claimed she was 14 when assaults occurred in December 2013.

The lawsuit claims the three students lured the girl to a car in the school parking lot to listen to music and then raped her and forced to engage in unspecified sex acts with one of the football players while two others held her.

Serious allegations: A former student of Culver City High School has filed a civil complaint alleging she was raped by three football players in December of 2013 when she was 14

The girl claims the school district was negligent when she complained and as a result of her ordeal had to move school twice and now lives in Chicago.

The civil complaint, which identifies one of her alleged assailants as Jeremy Weaver, says that she was raped and made to perform oral sex 'and other sex acts' according to KTLA.

The teenager claims the attack was videoed and shared around the school along with 'rumors regarding A.S's 'sexual promiscuity'.

According to the girl, Weaver and the other two threatened her if she came forward.

Custody: One of the three defendants in the lawsuit is named as Jeremy Weaver and he was arrested on January 15 and convicted of a minor felony in June

Eventually, the teenager, who was a virgin at the time of the incident told school officials.

She claims they went to the boys with the allegations and as a result, she suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and attempted suicide.

Weaver was convicted of three counts of oral copulation with a minor and one count of dissuading a witness from committing a crime.

Jeremy Ray Weaver was arrested on January 15, 2014 and convicted in June.

Culver City Unified School District has not immediately responded to a request for comment from KTLA.
