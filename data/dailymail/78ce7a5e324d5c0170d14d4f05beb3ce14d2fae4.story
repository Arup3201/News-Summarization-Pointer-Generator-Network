A pregnant journalist was recovering in hospital last night after a pro-Kremlin political leader in Russia told two male aides to ‘violently rape’ her.

Nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky launched his extraordinary tirade after reporter Stella Dubovitskaya asked him an innocuous question about sanctions against Ukraine.

The 67-year-old MP’s outburst came before a deadly gunfight at a Ukraine checkpoint controlled by pro-Russian separatists tore apart an Easter truce.

Vladimir Zhironovsky launched an extraordinary rant at journalist Stella Dubovitskaya (pictured right in a light-coloured shirt) at a press conference today - telling two male aides to 'violently' rape her

Zhirinovsky turns to shout at the journalist, who is six months pregnant, after she asks him about sanctions against Ukraine

The attack raised tensions and led separatists to call for Russian military intervention to protect civilians

Moscow
 and local militia claimed five people were killed in the firefight at 
around 1am yesterday near Slavyansk, blaming a far-right group for the 
attack.

‘The Easter truce has been violated,’ the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.

‘This provocation…testifies to the lack of will on the part of the Kiev authorities to rein in and disarm extremists.’

The politician approaches the female reporter - gesticulating at her wildly. He then told her: 'This is no place for you if you're pregnant'

But Ukraine has accused Moscow of a ‘cynical provocation’ staged by outside forces.

Yesterday
 Pope Francis prayed in his Easter message that God would ‘enlighten and
 inspire the initiatives that promote peace in Ukraine, so that all 
those involved…will make every effort to prevent violence’.

The
 fatal assault was the first serious violence since last week’s signing 
of a proposed peace plan between Russia, Ukraine, the US and the 
European Union.

The deal requires illegal military groups to disband and for gangs to leave seized buildings.

Two of Zhirinovsky's aides then approach the woman, following his commands. One grabs the pregnant reporter while others jump to her defence

It
 was rejected by separatist leaders, who still occupy police stations 
and government offices in at least ten cities. Ukraine’s interim prime 
minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk has accused Russian president Vladimir Putin 
of trying to ‘restore the Soviet Union.’

He said that if Putin succeeded
 it would be ‘the biggest disaster of this century’.

In
 Moscow, Zhirinovsky’s conduct towards the pregnant reporter has been 
referred to the Russian parliament’s ethics commission and he faces 
legal action from Miss Dubovitskaya’s employer, news agency Russia 
Today.

One of the man's aides turns to look at Zhirinovsky - who then calls one of the reporter's defenders an 'interfering lesbian.' Stella Dubovitskaya is now in hospital following her ordeal

‘Due to the 
disgusting incident in the state duma, after which our correspondent was
 hospitalised because of Vladimir Zhirinovsky’s discourtesy, we have 
decided to use all legal options to punish Mr Zhirinovsky as severely as
 possible under the law, including by suing him,’ said general director 
Margareta Simonyan.

After 
Miss Dubovitskaya’s question, the founder of the far right Liberal 
Democratic Party began shouting before manhandling two young male aides 
towards the pregnant mother-of-one.

He then shouted to them: ‘When I say, you run to her and violently rape her.’

Zhirinovsky apologised for his actions during a live interview on Russian television this evening

The man said: 'When talking to the press in the Duma on Friday, answering questions at the end, I spoke a bit rudely when I replied to a young woman. I offer my apologies to her and to everyone, if I happened to offend someone'

A
 male journalist told Zhirinovsky: ‘She is pregnant, why are you 
attacking her?’

Zhirinovsky then pushed two aides towards the 
journalist, who is six months pregnant, shouting: ‘Go and kiss her. Grab
 her.’

One physically touched Miss Dubovitskaya, to the shock of the watching press, with several female reporters recoiling. 

The gun battle was evidence that Ukraine is not reining in gun-wielding far right extremists, Russia claimed

The attack shows that the Ukrainian authorities are failing to rein in armed extremists, Russia's foreign ministry said today

At
 this point, another female reporter,  Yulia Chuchalova from news agency
 Interfax, told Zhirinovsky: ‘This is derogatory, humiliating – what are
 you doing here?’

Zhirinovsky hit back: ‘What are you doing intervening 
here, you lesbian? Get out of here.’

He
 shouted: ‘This is no place for you if you’re pregnant. We need healthy 
people. Pregnant women should not show up at work. Sit at home and look 
after your child, got that?’

He then shouted ‘get out of here, you damned lesbians’.
