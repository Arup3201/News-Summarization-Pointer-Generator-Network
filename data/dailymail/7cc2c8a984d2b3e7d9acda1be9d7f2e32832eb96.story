Telecom giant Orange still offers the worst customer services for broadband users in Britain, according to the latest quarterly report from industry regulator Ofcom.

The company attracted more complaints over its broadband service than any of its rivals between October and December last year.

Orange first replaced TalkTalk as having the most complaints when previous figures were released at the end of the year.

'Getting worse': Regulator Ofcom claimed Orange was the worst for complaints about broadband service and that customer anger is increasing

Coming second: TalkTalk was overtaken as the 'most complained about' service but is still second on Ofcom's table

The new report - Ofcom's eighth - shows the service provided by Orange seems to have got even worse.

The company received 0.70 complaints for every 1,000 of its customers - up from 0.50 per 1,000 customers three months ago.

TalkTalk was the second most complained about broadband provider, although the number of complaints continued to fall. They received 0.33 complaints per 1,000 customers.

It came as another survey showed Britain
faces a broadband 'postcode lottery' with dramatic variations in speed 
within cities, despite the increasing availability of 4G, a new study 
suggests.

In the worst case
- Birmingham - there is a difference of up to 89 per cent between the 
fastest and slowest broadband, the report found.

Further swathes of consumers are 'stuck in the slow lane' in London, Bristol, Northampton and Glasgow, the study showed.

But in the Ofcom table, Sky received fewest complaints about broadband - 0.08 per 1,000 customers.

Orange has also overtaken T-Mobile by receiving the highest number of complaints about its pay monthly mobile service.

The firm received 0.21 complaints for every 1,000 customers - mainly because it withdrew its free broadband offer, but T-Mobile still received higher than average complaints.

O2 received fewest complaints about a pay monthly mobile service - just 0.06 complaints per 1,000 customers.

BT
Vision still attracts most pay TV complaints - 0.24 for every 1,000 
customers. This is six times greater than the industry average.

Ofcom
says complaints slightly increased compared with the previous 
three-month period because of problems with service provision and 
complaints handling issues.

Virgin Media also drew a high number of complaints, while Sky had fewest - a mere 0.02 for every 1,000 customers.

TalkTalk kept its position as Britain's most complained-about landline provider with 0.36 complaints per 1,000 customers.

Although the figure has declined slightly, the rate remains at nearly double the industry average.

Customers are most unhappy about service faults and customer service issues.

BT also attracted higher-than-average complaints, while Virgin had fewest - just 0.11 complaints per 1,000 customers.

The
report found that complaints about pay-monthly mobile services had 
increased slightly, while the level of complaints about the other three 
categories had fallen.

Claudio
Pollack, Director of Ofcom's consumer group, said: 'It's encouraging to
see a continuing decline in the total volume of complaints, and we hope
these figures will incentivise providers to further improve their 
performance.

'We're committed to providing consumers with valuable information to help them choose a provider that best suits their needs.'

A
spokesman for Orange (now part of EE) said: 'We are of course 
disappointed by these latest results and will take on board the findings
of the Ofcom report as we strive to offer our customers the best 
service at all times.'
