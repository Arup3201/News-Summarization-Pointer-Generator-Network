When former front man of the Lostprophets Ian Watkins was sentenced to a minimum of 29 years in jail after admitting 13 serious sexual offences, those who had been close to him were shocked beyond belief.

Now a former lover of the singer - who went on to become the manager of the now disbanded rock group - has spoken for the first time about her relationship with Watkins.

Karen Ruttner, 32, from New York, dated Watkins casually for three years between 2007 and 2010.

Speaking to Krissi Murison of the Sunday Times Magazine, Karen reveals she had no idea about Watkin’s depraved crimes during the time she was having a relationship with him, and was deeply shocked at his admission of guilt.

‘This person that I had been so close with at that point, for six years, was… capable of this? I thought I knew when he was lying. I thought I knew what his demons were,' she told Murison in an interview.

Karen says she knew about Ian’s drug problems, which included crystal meth and cocaine abuse. She also says she was happy for him to sleep with other women during their ‘open relationship’.

She believed him to be addicted to sex: ‘There were no alarm bells. I just knew that he had a ferocious sexual appetite.’

Karan, who met Watkins in 2006 at the club she ran in New York, said that Watkins’ arrogance and intelligence attracted her to the star immediately.

However his drug dependency worsened in the years she knew him, causing problems in his career as well as exacerbating his sexual appetites.  

Speaking of his addiction to cyrstal meth, she said: 'It upped his appetite. Oh, my God. His judgement went out the window,’ recalls Karen, who says that Watkin’s continued spiral into addiction left him ‘disgusting’.

Karen says that Watkins' drug abuse  increased his libido and made him 'disgusting'

Watkins, 36, from Pontypridd, was jailed for a minimum of 29 years for 13 child sex offences at Cardiff Crown Court in December last year.

Karen believes that being able to easily connect with fans online was an factor in Watkins’ crimes.

Karen says, ‘If you take someone like Ian, and then you give him access to all these oversexed young women and men online it’s a recipe for disaster.’

The star was described as a 'determined and committed paedophile' by judge after he admitted 13 offences, including two counts of attempted rape of a baby.

Karen became a manager of  Lostprophets (from left-  Lee Gaze, Stuart Richardson, Mike Lewis, Ian Watkins and Luke Johnson) who have now split up

His two accomplices - fans who he met online, who can only be named as Woman A and Woman B for legal reasons - were jailed for 14 years and 16 years respectively.

He encouraged the second woman to abuse her child during a webcam chat and secretly stashed child porn videos, some of which he had made himself.

Sentencing judge Mr Justice Royce told Watkins: 'Those who have appeared in these courts over many years see a large number of horrific cases. This case, however, breaks new ground.

'I am satisfied that you are a deeply corrupting influence, you are highly manipulative, you are a sexual predator, you are dangerous.

'The public and, in particular, young females need protection from you.'

Lostprophets were founded in Pontypridd in 1997 and the band sold about 3.5 million albums worldwide.

His former bandmates have turned their back on him, saying they are 'heartbroken, angry, and disgusted' at his crimes. They have urged more of his victims to contact police.
