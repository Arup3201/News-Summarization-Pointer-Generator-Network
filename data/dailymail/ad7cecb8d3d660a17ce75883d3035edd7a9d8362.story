If T-Pain was from Hyderabad, he might sound a little like Vennu Mallesh.

The Indian singer has become an Internet sensation in the West after users discovered one of his videos and spread it across social networks.

The general consensus is that it is awful. So awful, in fact, that it's amazing. But having racked up in excess of 4.2million views, Mr Mallesh is probably laughing along with his critics - and all the way to the bank.

It's My Life: Vannu Mallesh sings in the video which has made him a worldwide musical sensation

Viral: Mr Mallesh's YouTube video has racked up more than 4million views since it was published in 2012

Heartfelt: The 29-year-old singer says he was inspired to write the song by his life experiences 

The song, It's My Life (What Ever I Wanna Do), is a fairly catchy piece of Auto-Tune pop, in the style of early Lil Wayne, which Mr Mallesh, 29, describes as 'a non-fictional, psychological and philosophical song written by me’.

In the song's description on YouTube, he goes on: 'My Life inspired me to write the lyrics, lyrics inspired me to compose tune, lyrics and tune inspired me to Sing. That's what the actual happened to the "Born of the Song".

'The words I penned for the lyrics of the Song are genuinely written from the bottom of My Heart which describes about "My Attitude".'

The heartfelt slice of pop has been panned by critics, both professional and amateur. Reporting on its going viral, a writer for India TV News described it as both 'torturous' and 'unmelodious'.

'Be assured the video is not being popularized due to his singing but instead for his audacity to sing,' the reporter sniped.

YouTube commenters have not been any more charitable towards Mr Mallesh's efforts. 'He is one s*** singer,' remarked one user on the video sharing site.

Another wrote: 'You sir have the most retarded songs/voice I've ever heard.'

Indeed, it does appear from the undoubtedly heartfelt lyrics that English is not Mr Mallesh's mother tongue.

'People think I am somewhat mental / They don't know I am very sentimental,' he sings. 'Friend of mine says I am a waste fellow / He don't know the taste of this fellow.'

But Mr Mallesh has taken a philosphical attitude towards the haters - or 'hell wishers' as he dubs them. A post on his Twitter account about all the attention It's My Life has attracted reads: 'My Hell Wishers helped to make this...

'My Well Wishers helped to make it as Hit...

'My Fans helped to make it a Super Hit...

'Now everyone helped in making it as a Sensation...'

Indeed, with YouTube reportedly paying video contributors as between $2.50 and $5 per thousand views, that means that Mr Mallesh may have made at least $10,000 from It's My Life.

And that can go a long way in Hyderabad.
