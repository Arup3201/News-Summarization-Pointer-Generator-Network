China will monitor and rank incidents of misbehaviour by their  tourists abroad so that they can be  passed on to tour operators and travel agents, for them to decide whether to do business with them again, state media says.

The program, put forward by China's National Tourism Administration (NTA), is designed to  curb incidents of violent or disruptive behaviour by mainland tourists while travelling or on holiday.

NTA chairman Li Jinzao said that the information would be given to travel companies to allow them to decide 'whether to sell the person that ticket, or whether to let them take my flight,' according to South China Morning Post.

Two passengers aboard a flight in China were jailed earlier this month after opening the plane’s emergency exit doors in protest at a lengthy delay

The new classification system will be launched in the second quarter and will also include information on the number of complaints received by attractions and hotels, how many had been dealt with and – of those that had been handled – how many customers had been satisfied with the outcome.

The last few years have seen a string of embarrassing and high-profile incidents of bad behaviour by Chinese tourists, denting their reputation worldwide.

During a flight from Bangkok to Nanjing last month a video went viral of a passenger scalding a Thai stewardess with hot water and noodles and threatening to blow up the plane after a heated exchange. 

At the time state media branded the group of mainline airline passengers involved 'barbarians' and four of the tourists have since been blacklisted by the provincial tourist board. 

China Eastern Airlines flight MU2036 travelling from Chengdu to Beijing was already seven hours behind schedule at 3:45am on Saturday morning because of snow when crew began to de-ice the plane at the Kunming airport

Just days later a plane was nearly forced to return after a brawl broke out between four women on a flight from mainland China to Hong Kong over a noisy baby.

Also last month, a Chinese passenger on board an internal Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu sparked a safety scare by yanking open an emergency exit just before a plane was due to take off to 'get some fresh air', Southern Metropolis Daily reported. 

In December a brawl erupted on a board a Chinese flight from to Chongqing to Hong Kong over a woman's crying baby

In the same month a Chinese passenger on a China Eastern flight MU2331 from Xi’an opened an emergency slide because he wanted to get off the plane quicker

This isn't the first time that Chinese authorities have spoken out on the issue. Wang Yang, one of China's four vice premiers, gave a disparaging view of Chinese tourists in 2013.

He said: 'They speak loudly in public, carve characters on tourist attractions, cross the road when the traffic lights are still red, spit anywhere and [carry out] some other uncivilized behavior. It damages the image of the Chinese people and has a very bad impact,' according to the Guardian.

In 2013, the government introduced a new set of laws, primarily to regulate tour operators, including a clause advising Chinese tourists to behave well wherever they went in the world.
