Paul Slane refuses to accept that a brush with notoriety will provide a full stop on his football career.

After 18 months without a club, the 22-year-old is fighting to return to the game and bring an end to a self-confessed ‘nightmare’.

When Slane was just 18, he won what he thought would be a dream move from Motherwell to Celtic. But cruciate ligament damage was followed by ankle and hip problems as a grim toll of injuries left him in despair.

Second chances: Paul Slane is hoping to rebuild his career

Restart: He is currently taking part in Revolution Sports Management Pre-Season Camp for out-of-contract players

Slane was released by Celtic in January 2013 with a £10,000 pay-off that would fund a hip  operation. But he admitted he blew around half of that sum on nights out, including an infamous trip to Amsterdam that saw photos of Slane with prostitutes go viral on Twitter.

Inevitably, that made him a  feature of the tabloid news pages but the midfielder is now desperate to once again win headlines for his undoubted ability.

Slane has enrolled in a summer training camp run by Revolution Sports Management in East Kilbride to boost his fitness and win back employment.

His determination is fuelled not just by his own pride and  ambition, but also by a desire to repay parents George and Susan for helping him through such a grim period.

‘When I was at Motherwell and Celtic, there was never any trouble,’ insisted Slane. ‘They know the type of person I am.

‘Obviously, when I left I did a stupid thing. The worst thing about that is not about myself but I was putting my mum and dad through it. My main aim now is just to get fit and show people that I am not really like that.’

What money Slane earned from his contract at Celtic has long gone, forcing him to rely on cash from his parents at the family home in Anderston.

‘It’s not a nice feeling to do that,’ he admitted. ‘I spoke to my mum and dad and said it might be time for me to get a job.

‘But if I got a job, I’d have missed out on my rehab sessions. We came to the decision that I’d keep doing that and live off my mum and dad giving me money here and there.

‘At this stage of my life, I should be giving them money. That’s the hardest thing. From a young age when I made it, I always wanted to be able to help my mum and dad.

‘It’s the other way about just now but, hopefully, I can pay them back in the next few years.

‘I want to repay the faith they have shown in me.’

Slane is now taking forward strides, but even getting to this stage has been an arduous road.

Former glory: Slane has played in the past for Celtic, Motherwell and MK Dons

Capped: He also played five times for Scotland's under-17s

‘I left Celtic and went to Motherwell but my hip was too sore at the time,’ he reflected. ‘I decided to get the operation and it’s been a nightmare ever since. It’s broken my heart.

‘I did the rehab after the  operation myself and it didn’t go too well. There were times when it was sore and I was training when I shouldn’t have been.

‘But there were also times when I should have pushed through it, but took days off instead.

‘I’d gone to Kilmarnock at the start of last season but I wasn’t ready. It took me about nine months to feel strong again.

‘I went to Morton at the end of last season and it felt great to be back training. It’s amazing to be playing football and I’m ready to kick on now.’

Slane has not set his sights on any specific level of the game. Four years on from joining Celtic, he just wants another chance to shine.

‘When you break through, people are talking about you,’ said Slane. ‘All your pals and family say it’s the perfect life. It’s a dream for every boy and you are living it.

‘But then it gets taken away  from you through injuries. It’s soul- destroying at times. But you need to be strong enough to believe you can get it back.

‘If you are going to feel sorry for yourself, you’d be as well giving up. Even when I was feeling down, I kept telling myself to keep  fighting and that I’d get back to a level and enjoy myself again.

‘I think I’ve maybe gone through six operations. I can’t accept that I’m not meant to play football. I will fight until the day it is  impossible. This is the biggest year I have ever faced football-wise, so I’m excited about it.’

THE RSM training camps are held at the K-Park in East Kilbride and are open to players in and out of contract. For information or to book a place, call John Kavanagh on 07830 335625 or Jan Lokaj on 07964 434694.
