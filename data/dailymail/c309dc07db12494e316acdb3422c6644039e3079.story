Read MARTIN SAMUEL's expert view on what the future holds for Hatem Ben Arfa

Hamburg have joined Nice by showing interest in Newcastle midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa.

The 27-year-old is free to leave the North-East after failing to impress during his loan spell at Hull City.

Lille and Monaco are also interested in Ben Arfa, but the Bundesliga side's enquiries are the most advanced.

Ben Arfa, who has 13 caps for France, joined Hull on a season-long loan after Newcastle boss Alan Pardew criticised him for a lack of professionalism. 

French international Hatem Ben Arfa has emerged as a target for Bundesliga side Hamburg

The 27-year-old's loan spell is being cut short by Hull having played just nine games for the club

But he has only made nine appearances for Steve Bruce's side and the Hull manager told the BBC last week: 'Sometimes transfers don't work, especially with a loan deal.

'I'm disappointed. We brought him in on a wave of publicity and there has been no fallout or slanging match.

'His views of the game are different to mine. At any club you need to have a certain work ethic to get in the team, that's the frustrating thing. 

Ben Arfa scored 14 goals in 86 appearances for Newcastle but is surplus to requirements at St James' Park

'I hope Hatem takes in what I've had to say to him because his talent is there for all to see. But talent without hard work means you won't live up to your potential.

'To play for me you have to know you are playing for the team. To be a great you have to be a team player.'

Ben Arfa scored 14 goals in 86 appearances for Newcastle but had a strained relationship with the manager, with Pardew saying: 'He won't be coming back here, that's all I can say.'
