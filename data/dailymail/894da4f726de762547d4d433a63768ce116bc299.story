Amanda Knox inflicted the fatal knife wound that killed Meredith Kercher, a court has ruled.

High on drugs, she cut the British exchange student’s neck with a kitchen knife during a row over money, the court in Italy has said.

Miss Kercher, 21, a Leeds University student, was found half-naked, her throat slit, in the cottage she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007.

The appellate court in Florence has released papers saying that British student Meredith Kercher (left) argued with American roommate Amanda Knox (right) about money on the night Kercher was killed

The 337-page document adds that Kercher's wounds show she was held down and then stabbed, ruling out the possibility that there was only one attacker

Knox,
 26, and former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29, served four years for 
the brutal murder before being exonerated on appeal in 2011.

Then,
 in a retrial earlier this year, the pair’s acquittal was overturned and
 they were  sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively. A third man, 
Ivory Coast national Rudy Guede is serving a 16-year  sentence for the 
killing.

The court in Florence has now published the reasons behind Knox and Sollecito’s reconviction.

Prosecutors
 had originally maintained the murder was the result of a sex game gone 
wrong, but the judges dismissed this theory, saying an agreement to have
 group sex ‘was not compatible with Meredith’s character’. 

Found guilty: Knox and Socellito served four years in prison before being acquitted and released. However, they were reconvicted by the Florence appeals court on January 30, and sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively

The killing, 
they said, followed an argument between the two girls, which ‘exploded 
into  violence’ with Knox under the influence of drugs.

Statements by Guede, taken by police, said that Kercher had previously accused Knox of taking money from her room.

Court papers conclude that Miss Kercher must have had 'multiple aggressors' and her death was not solely down to Rudy Guede (file pic)

And
 on the night of the murder these tensions came to a head when Amanda 
let Rudy, an acquaintance who had a history of petty crime, into the 
house, the judges said.

‘Because the accused were high and because of the level of tension between the girls, it exploded into violence.’

During
 the attack it was Rudy who held Meredith back, while Amanda slit her 
throat, the reasoning said. Sollecito also held a knife.

‘The
 DNA on her wrists and inside Meredith lead us to say that Rudy during 
the attack was not holding a knife but had his hands free which he used 
to carry out sexual  violence and to help to immobilise the girl.’

Of
 two knives used in the murder, the smaller one, which produced the 
wound on the right side of the neck, was held by Rafaelle Sollecito, it 
said.

‘The blade which 
produced the wound on the left side of the neck, from which most of the 
blood emerged and which caused the death of Meredith Kercher, was held 
by Amanda Knox,’ the court report said.

The
 judgment reinstated two crucial pieces of DNA evidence discredited in 
the original appeal court that let Knox and Sollecito walk free.

The
 amount of DNA on the alleged murder weapon, a kitchen knife seized from
 Sollecito’s house which had traces of Miss Kercher on the blade, was 
then disputed as too small.

Papers say that Knox killed Miss Kercher, and was backed up by boyfriend Sollecito (pictured) 

And the court found DNA on Miss Kercher’s 
bra strap belonging to Rafaelle Sollecito could have been the result of 
contamination.

But in the 
latest judgment the court confirmed that the kitchen knife ‘had the 
victim’s DNA on the blade… and was the same knife used by Amanda Marie 
Knox to stab Meredith Kercher in the left side of the neck, in so 
causing the only mortal wound’. The court accepted that Sollecito’s DNA 
was on Meredith’s bra, leaving them ‘in no doubt that Amanda and 
Rafaelle were in the house that night’.

Italy’s
 highest court must now confirm the conviction. Then Italy will attempt 
to extradite Knox but their chances of success are minimal, diplomatic 
sources say.

The American said she will become ‘a fugitive’.

After
 she was freed in 2011, Knox immediately returned to her hometown of 
Seattle to rebuild her life. She has found love with old friend James  
Terrano and is now a creative writing student.

Last year she released a prison memoir for which she was paid a reported £2.6million.

On November 2, 2007, the body of Meredith Kercher, a British exchange student from Coulsden, Surrey, is found in a pool of blood in and apartment in Perugia

November 6: Police arrest Meredith's American housemate Knox, then 20, Sollecito, then 23, and Congolese Diya 'Patrick' Lumumba, who runs a local bar.

Police claim Meredith was murdered because she refused to take part in violent sex. Knox is said to have broken down and confessed and implicated Lumumba. The three are held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit manslaughter and sexual violence.

November 11: Meredith's body is flown home. Knox's mother, Edda Mellas, says Knox did not hear Miss Kercher's screams the night she died and was with Sollecito at his house.

November 19: A fourth suspect is named as Rudy Hermann Guede, 20, from the Ivory Coast. He is thought to have left Perugia for Milan after Meredith died.
