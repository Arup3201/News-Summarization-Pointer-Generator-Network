Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has wished Diego Costa well at Chelsea and believes he can make a major influence on the Premier League.

Chelsea have agreed a £32.5million deal for the Spanish international, with Jose Mourinho finally bagging the centre forward he had always wished for since his return to Stamford Bridge.

And Simeone, whose side got to the Champions League final in Lisbon, losing 4-1 to Real Madrid after extra time, has nothing but good words for Costa.

'I wish him the very best at Chelsea,' he said. 'He can still keep growing.

'He's at an age where he can continue to improve so let's hope he can develop further. I'm sure he'll be a success.

'I'm always going to be thankful to the players that give all their best. He had excellent performances while he was with us.'

Costa scored 36 goals in all competitions for Atletico last season, with the 25-year-old spending four years at the Vicente Calderon.
