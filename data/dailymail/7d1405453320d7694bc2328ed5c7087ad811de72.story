A girl was freed by firefighters after getting her head wedged in the front gate while imitating a favourite stunt of her pet dog.

Rachel Warren, four, had watched the family's Rottweiler Tess push her head through the bars of the gate at their home in Brierley Hill, West Midlands  - and then decided to copy.

After unsuccessfully trying to ease her daughter from between the bars, her mother Carlene turned to the fire service.

I'm in a bit of a bind: Rachel had to be rescued by the fire brigade after getting her head trapped between these metal bars

The youngster got her head stuck in the front gate after trying to copy her Rottweiler Tess

Mrs Warren, a 32-year-old 
shopkeeper, said: 'I was just taking Rachel to nursery and she had her 
reins on. She ran outside and was pretending to be a dog as she loves 
to.

'I heard a noise, went outside and there she was, stuck fast.

'My
friend was with me and we tried to pull the bars apart, but they 
wouldn't budge. I shouted at her to call the fire brigade now, I was 
starting to panic.

All smiles: Rachel and her mother Carlene were on the way to nursery school when the accident happened

'Rachel was a bit upset at first but she calmed down after I told her Fireman Sam was on his way.'

Rachel, who has a 15-year-old brother
Matthew, was freed within minutes by firefighters who prised apart the 
gate at the semi-detached home.

Mrs Warren added: 'Rachel was really 
excited and screamed ''here's Fireman Sam''. When they got out she asked
them where the rest of the characters were.

'They let her sit in the engine, she loved the whole thing. They even offered to take her back to nursery.

'She declined, but she was back in nursery soon after.

'The teachers weren't surprised, she's always pretending to be a dog and getting into scrapes.

'We've had those gates as long as my son's been alive, and he's 15.

'Neither he or our actual dog have managed to get stuck like that before.

'There was no more than a five minute gap between the call connecting and them arriving on the scene - the fire service was great.'

Racher's father, bus driver Wayne Warren, 33, was at work at the time of the mishap.

He said: 'She's still the same, bouncy and happy, as if nothing happened.

'She was happy they let her sit in the fire engine afterwards and she got to wear a helmet as well.'

However her mother is still upset by the incident.

She said: 'I barely slept last night, my hand's are still shaking. I'm never letting her do that, ever again.'

Firefighter Richard Dunleavy said: 'Rachel stayed very calm.'
