A Virginia mother-of-three has died after being hit by an alleged drunk driver who lost his own wife - with whom he had three children - in a car crash nearly 10 years ago.

Meg Cross Menzies, 34, was jogging on East Patrick Henry Road in Hanover about 8am Monday when she was killed.

The driver, 47-year-old Dr. Michael J. Carlson, allegedly had a 0.11 percent blood alcohol level when he drove his SUV off the road and fatally struck Menzies. The legal limit is 0.08 percent.

Fit and healthy: Meg Cross Menzies loved to jog and was training for the Boston Marathon in April when she was killed

News of the avid runner's tragic death has left the close-knit community heartbroken. Menzies was about a mile away from home when she was mowed down.

The religious woman doted on her three young children, sons Gabriel and Whitfield and daughter Skye, and described herself as a 'full-time mom'.

Doug Fernandez, who ran with Menzies in the Richmond Road Runners club several times a week, said the town was in 'shock'. He said Menzies was training for the Boston Marathon in April.

'We all like a big family. Total disbelief about it; it's just like it's not real,' he told WRIC.com.

'It's a total shock. Difficult [to] accept … don't know how we gonna get over this. She was a very happy, outgoing runner, the nicest person you could ever meet.'

The Ashland Police Department - where Menzies' husband, Sergeant Scott Menzies, is stationed - is also mourning the young mom's death.

'Meg has equally been a part of our law enforcement family for nearly a decade and her presence in our midst, and especially that of her family, will be sorely missed,' Chief Doug Goodman said in a statement.

'With her support, Sergeant Menzies has been a steadfast catalyst for improving safety in our community... To lose his wife in this manner is simply unfathomable.'

The driver: Dr. Michael J. Carlson has been charged with DUI and involuntary manslaughter over the incident

More than 1,200 mourners gathered at Menzies' funeral on Thursday to pay their respects to the well-loved woman.

And today, thousands of people across the country are expected to pull on their running shoes and jog in honor of the Kersey Creek Elementary School substitute teacher.

More than 77,000 people have signed up to participate.

'In her honor, our hope is to raise 
awareness of drunk driving, texting and driving, and overall safety of 
runners and cyclists everywhere,' Brooke Roney, creator of
Facebook page 'Meg’s Miles' promoting the national runs, wrote.

Meanwhile, Carlson has been charged with DUI and involuntary manslaughter, and granted a $25,000 secured bond, over the tragic death, Times Dispatch reported. 

Police say they found prescription drugs and an unopened 
can of beer in his SUV at the accident scene.

The loss of Menzies is hauntingly reminiscent of what happened to his own wife nearly a decade ago.

In July 2004, the Bon Secours Richmond Health System physician lost his wife, the mother of three young children, after a head-on collision in New York state when the family was on vacation visiting relatives. Claudia D’Agostino Carlson was 37.

About $20 million in damages was reportedly awarded to the Carlson family, but ultimately reduced to reduced to $7.7 million. It is not clear if the money was ever paid.
