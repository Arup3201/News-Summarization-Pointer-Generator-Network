After Xherdan Shaqirii’s demonstration of thigh power earlier this week, it now appears that he faces serious competition from the Germans.

Shaquiri showed off his powerful thigh muscles during Switzerland’s training sessions earlier this week but the Swiss star, whose side exited the World Cup after a 1-0 defeat by Argentina in the World Cup, faces a challenge from the German squad to emerge as ‘King of the Thighs’ at this World Cup.

Arsenal forward Lukas Podolski tweeted a picture along with his German team-mates Jerome Boeteng, Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira as they posed with their shorts rolled up to show off their leg power ahead of their upcoming quarter-final against France.

Shaqiri’s thighs may still usurp those of the Germans but all these contenders struggle to compete with those of British cycling legend Chris Hoy, whose upper legs each measure 27 inches wide in circumference.

The Germans head into this weekend’s eagerly anticipated clash with plenty to prove after an unconvincing performance in the 2-1 victory over Algeria in extra-time, and manager Joachim Low has urged his side to rise to the occasion in one of the international game’s most iconic fixtures.

‘France versus Germany has always been a classic, they were always very dramatic and tense,’ the German coach enthused, ‘France after 2010 and 2012 with (coach Didier) Deschamps have developed very well, they are strong and fighting, in midfield and defence. Up front they have (Karim) Benzema and (Olivier) Giroud.

'So Germany-France has always been played with a high tension.’
