 

A South Carolina fourth-grader had a heartfelt reunion with her father when the returning soldier snuck into a school assembly in a pig costume.

Wearing the Piggly Wiggly Pig suit, Staff Sgt. Joel Spector made a surprise visit at the Columbia school. 

He had just finished a nine-month tour through Afghanistan.

KTLA reports that The Saint Joseph Catholic School told students that the assembly was actually being held to recognize students who excelled at math in order to keep Spector's daughter in the dark

While they did honor the school's top 25 math students, no one had a better time than Spector's daughter Inara.

She told WISTV that she didn't recognize her dad at first with the height added by the Piggly Wiggly costume's feet and his longer hair. 

But once he had the pig's mask all the way off and leaned down to hug her, she covered her mouth in shock and joy.

Thumbs up! No doubt the soldier dad was thrilled his suprise went off without a hitch
