Couples about to walk  down the aisle have been left devastated after a Bali wedding company went bust, owing $180,000. 

So far nine couples from Western Australia have so far registered complaints against Australian-owned company Bali D'Luxe with Consumer Protection and it is believed many more will come forward.

Bali D'Luxe advertises itself online as having more than 20 years experience in organising weddings in Bali and say the 'offer our clients a range of services from our hand picked luxury villa and accommodation collection, tailored tour experiences, weddings and events, private parties and much more'.

Amy-Mae Perry and partner Jake Smith are due to get married on November 8 in Bali 

The couple have been left 'heartbroken' because they now have to find another $4000 for their wedding

The website is still up and running but the company's Facebook and Twitter accounts have been closed down. 

Some of the couples had also arrived in Bali to find out services had not been paid for.

Mother of one Amy-Mae Perry, 25, from Ballajura, WA, was due to marry her partner Jake Smith on November 8 on the holiday island after spending 12 months planning the ceremony. 

Miss Perry explained they deposited $6300 into a bank account and not by credit card where they might have been able to get the money back

A liquidator was appointed after sole director Catherine Williams voluntarily wound the business up  

Amy-Mae and Jake have been planning their nuptials for 12 months and say the excitement of getting married has been taken away from them

The couple, who have been together for four years, don't know if their dream ceremony will go ahead because they now have to find another $4000 at last minute to pay for the ceremony, reception, cake, videographer and flowers. 

Ms Perry told Daily Mail Australia: 'We are heartbroken, I got an email on Tuesday lunchtime from the insolvency company confirming our worst fears. 

'We had seen on the internet the night before lots of people talking about it but it didn't sink in until we got that email.' 

Ms Perry said she researched getting married abroad because she had family from the UK coming over for the wedding, many of whom who have booked flights and accommodation.

The couple say they paid director Catherine Williams $6300 and they deposited it into a bank account, not by credit card where they might have been able to get the money back. 

She said: 'We chose this company because her site looked nice and there was lots of positive feedback and lots of information.

The site, which is still live, says the company has more than 20 years experience and will cater to all the needs of the bride and groom

'There were no alarm bells until after we went over to Bali in August to visit Catherine. After that she started taking longer to reply to emails and that is when we started to become concerned. 

'I think she must have gone into hiding because we have not heard from her for a long time.  

'My fiancée is very annoyed. We have been planning it for a long time and this experience has taken the fun out of getting married, it's not exciting any more. 

'We don't know if our wedding is going to go ahead but I would say to anyone looking to use a company like this do your research and pay on a credit card.' 

Acting commissioner for Consumer Protection David Hillyard said a liquidator was appointed after the sole director Catherine Williams voluntarily wound the business up.

'Bali D'Luxe customers are now classed as unsecured creditors and should register their details with the liquidator RSM Bird Cameron Partners via Mr Louis Bailey,' Mr Hillyard said.

'The insolvency process can take time and you may not get all, or any, money back.

'If you made a Bali D'Luxe booking using a credit card or selecting 'credit' on a debit card, you should seek a chargeback (transaction reversal) from your card provider because you did not receive any goods or services in return for the amount paid.' 

Daily Mail Australia tried to get in contact with Bali D'Luxe and has not received a response.
