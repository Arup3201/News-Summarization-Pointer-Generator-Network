Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios has staged the performance of his life, mounting an incredible comeback to upset French 13th seed Richard Gasquet in a Wimbledon classic.

Kyrgios, at 19 the youngest man in the draw,  came from two sets down and saved nine match points over four successive games in the final set before clinching victory 3-6, 6-7 (7-4), 6-4, 7-5, 10-8.

'It was an unbelievable match out there,' Kyrgios said.

Kyrgios's opponent in the next round is Czech wildcard Jiri Vesely, ranked 66th in the world, who beat Gael Monfils in the second round 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 6-7 (1-7. 6-4). If Kyrgios beats Vesely he could face Rafael Nadal in the fourth round.

'It's definitely the biggest win of my career.

'I'm so proud of how I hung in and fought it out.'

No player has saved nine match points and gone on to win a grand slam match in a decade, while it hasn't happened at Wimbledon since 1966.

Ranked 144th in the world, Kyrgios (pronounced Keer-ios) earned a wildcard entry to the grass court grand slam after winning a Challenger event in Nottingham earlier this month.

After battling past unseeded Frenchman Stephane Robert in the first round he was given an outside chance against world No.14 Gasquet, runner-up at Eastbourne last week.

Kyrgios, an Australian of Greek and Malaysian parentage who grew up in Canberra, said support from the rowdy Australian 'Fanatics' had 'definitely helped'.

'It was an unbelievable match out there. The first time I've been two sets to love down, come back and won. It's an amazing feeling,' he said

'I played some unbelievable tennis. He was coming up with some really good shots as well. I think I saved nine match points. There's plenty of opportunities he could have taken. I came out on top, I'm really happy.'

At the beginning of the match on Thursday Kyrgios was seemingly on his way out, having lost the opening two sets 6-4, 7-6. But, two weeks after Andy Murray described him as the next big Australian talent, he fought back to take the third 6-4.

He faced match points in the fourth but held off Gasquet 7-5 before a stunning decider. At 4-5 down, Kyrgios appeared to have double faulted on match point but was spared by the narrowest of Hawkeye rulings and he ultimately pulled off a remarkable win, taking the fifth 10-8.

Gasquet, who like Kyrgios was once heralded as a future Grand Slam winner, said: ‘He is playing incredible. We all knew his potential.

‘I am sad because I lost nine match points. In the future he can be a top five player, I think, and he can win a Grand Slam.’

Kyrgios admitted that at the age of seven, when mother Norlaila first took him to tennis classes, he 'didn't want to play' the sport.

'It wasn't a bad choice. I like it now,' he added.

'I think my dad (George) was pretty big on becoming a tennis player. I enjoyed it as well. I loved basketball as well at the same time. I think it was good to have that balance of another sport while I was progressing.

'At 14 I had to make a choice, and I chose tennis.'
