A lesbian couple were legally wed in Russia on Friday, despite the country's ban on same-sex marriages. 

Irina Shumilova and Alyona Fursova were able to exploit a legal loophole because, despite living as a gay woman, Irina is a transsexual and listed as male on her passport.

Bride Irina explained that she categorically does not identify as a man. 'Yes, in my passport it says 'male',' she said.

The couple both chose to wear lace wedding gowns as they tied the knot in front of family and friends

According to her: 'Transgender is a term to describe discrepancies between social and biological sex. I am transsexual, meaning that despite I have XY-genome (sic), psychologically I am a woman.'

The couple married at a registry office in St Petersburg, with both choosing to wear traditional white wedding dresses for the day. 

They were surrounded by their friends and family who could be seen clapping and smiling as the two brides entered the building.

Their situation was explained by LGBT rights activist Anna Anisimova, 'The official registration by two women happened because one of them is a man according to the documents,' she said. 

'Formally it was a wedding between a man and a woman but de-facto it was between two women. It was the first (LGBT wedding) in Russia. Both brides wore white dresses.'

Following their nuptials Irina and Alyona were given a legal marriage certificate. Irina is currently undergoing hormone therapy and wears a blonde wig and make-up at all times.

However, despite their joy at their big day Irina and Alyona's union has come under fire from some members of their community who have suggested that their marriage should be annulled. 

St Petersburg MP Vitaly Milonov has said that he will investigate the validity of their marriage and made controversial comments.

He claimed that the workers at the registry office should not just have checked their sex on their passports.

Milonov reportedly told the Russian media, 'I understood their [registry office workers'] unconvincing arguments; they formally approached the issue and saw passports, but not people. I told the head [of the wedding registry office] that it is criminal negligence.'

He went on to say the wedding was, 'an ugly insult to millions of Russian families in the future... There are certain moral standards which it is vital to implement. These mad people should be banned altogether from getting married.' 

Gay marriage has only recently been legalised in the UK.

The legislation to allow same-sex marriage was passed in July 2013 and came into effect in March 2014.

The first official gay marriage took place on the 29th of March 2014. 

Prior to this same-sex couples who wished to solidify their union would have to enter into a civil partnership. 

This gave them the same rights as married couples however they were not allowed to refer to themselves as 'married.' 

Russia is known for its discrimination against those in the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community. Until 1999 homosexuality was referred to as a mental illness.

And although sexual activity between same-sex consenting adults in private has not been a criminal offence since 1993 there are still strict rules over the propagation of gay rights propaganda.

Indeed, in 2013 a law was put in place banning the distribution of materials promoting the LGBT community to young children.

And earlier this year a shocking documentary named Hunted highlighted the plight of gay people in Russia. 

Although many see Irina and Alyona's marriage as a step forward for the country and the first of its kind gay rights activist Nikolay Alekseev disagrees.

He told Russian TV show Russia Today that he does not believe their wedding should be counted as a same sex marriage, 'This is in no way a same-sex marriage. This is a question of transgender, not homosexuality.' 

'This is an old story, there had been such cases before. A certain gender is written in a passport, but how they dress for the wedding is their business.'
