A teenager has today spoken of his lucky
escape after falling 45 feet from a ski slope chair-lift in a 
terrifying moment caught on camera. 

More than 1.6 million people have watched
the YouTube video which shows Jacob Gutierrez's six minute attempt to hang on to the lift in the Ski Sante Fe resort 
before dropping onto the rocky snow-capped mountains below.

He was left with liver damage, a broken 
skull and collapsed lung in the fall on February 2 as he fooled around trying to throw a snowball at friends on another chair.

Lucky escape: Jacob Gutierrez, pictured, suffered a fractured skull and collapsed lung in the accident on February 2. He fell from the chair lift after throwing a snowball and failing to secure the safety bar

Holding on: The 17-year-old is filmed dangling in the air as the ski lift climbs higher and higher

Going, going, gone: Gutierrez can't hold on any longer and lets go dropping 45ft

Badly injured: Video footage captured Gutierrez hitting the snow after falling 45ft which resulted in him suffering a fractured skull and collapsed lung

Speaking today he said he recalled the moment he felt his grasp on the chair loosen.

'It was pretty terrifying,' he told ABC 
News. 'I was thinking if I fall wrong or if I land wrong on one of those
rocks I'm probably going to get really hurt or die. I'm just hanging on
and I just lose grip. I remember it all. I remember falling - it felt 
really far. I hit a rock and next thing I know I'm looking up at the ski
lift.' 

The 17-year-old, of Albuquerque, was 
with friends on a day out snowboarding when they got into a snowball 
fight.

He was traveling on the chair with female friend, Breezy Maupin, when he lost his footing. She desperately tried to pull him up but he eventually lost his grasp and fell onto the mountain-side.

He had to be air-lifted to University Hospital in Albuquerque following the accident and was put in intensive care.

Terrifying: The snowboarder's friend, Dallas Meiering looked on helplessly as Gutierrez clung on for dear life. He said today he thought he was dead

He has ongoing liver problems and a scar
on his head as a result of the fall which has scared him into taking the slopes more seriously. 

'I hit my head on the rock and there was
blood everywhere. I was in shock. I'm definitely going to wear a helmet
from now on,' he said.

His friend Dallas Meiering filmed the incident and posted it on YouTube on Monday.

He can be heard screaming 'Dude!' as he watches his Sandia High School  classmate lose his footing.

'As he was falling it was pretty scary. I thought he might die,' he told ABC.

A 19-year-old college student died last year after falling off a chairlift while skiing in Park City, Utah.

A boy also had to be rescued by strangers after he slid out of the chair and dangled 25ft in the air at the Hidden Valley Ski and Snowboard Area in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin in 2012.
