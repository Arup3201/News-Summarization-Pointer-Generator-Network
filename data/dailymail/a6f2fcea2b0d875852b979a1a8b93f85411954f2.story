Six climbers missing on Mount Rainier are presumed dead after 
helicopters detected pings from emergency beacons buried in the snow 
thousands of feet below their last known location, a national park 
official said Saturday.

Park Ranger Fawn Bauer said the helicopter crew also spotted camping and
 climbing gear in an avalanche-prone area more than 3,000 feet below the
 group's last known whereabouts.

The six were at 12,800 feet at last 
contact Wednesday.

Amongst the six climbers missing on Mount Rainier and presumed dead are guide Matt Hegeman, left, and climber Mark Mahaney, right

Experienced climber Mark Mahaney was on his second trip up Mount Rainier in Washington state

They were scheduled to reach the summit of Mount Rainier, a dormant volcano located near Seattle, on Thursday, with a day to climb down

'There's not a viable chance of survival,' Bauer said.

Air and ground searches were suspended late Saturday afternoon.

The 
bodies won't be recovered Sunday because they are in an extremely 
dangerous area, where snow, ice and rock fall constantly, she said.

'It would expose our rangers to pretty extreme conditions, so we are not
 able to do any kind of ground searching of that area,' she said. 'And, 
in all honesty, we may never be able to get on the ground there.'

The missing group includes four clients of Seattle-based Alpine Ascents 
International and two guides. They were due to return from the mountain 
on Friday.

Among those presumed dead are guide Matt Hegeman and 26-year-old climber Mark Mahaney of St. Paul.

Mahaney, an experienced climber who had scaled Mount Rainier at least once before was identified to KAALTV by his uncle, Rob Mahaney.

Mahaney said his brother and other nephew had flown to Seattle to await updates.

When they did not return, the climbing company notified park 
officials, Bauer said.

The search for the missing climbers (not pictured) is focusing on the Liberty Ridge area, near from where they were last heard from

'The last contact with them was at 12,800 feet,' Bauer said.

Mount
 Rainier, southeast of Seattle, stands at 14,410 feet and attracts 
thousands of climbers trying to reach its summit every year.

The
 last contact the group had with the climbing company was at 6pm 
Wednesday. They were scheduled to reach the summit of Mount Rainier on 
Thursday, with a day to climb down.

The group was equipped with satellite and mobile phones.

A
 small weather front that brought snow flurries and hail to the mountain
 moved in Wednesday, Bauer said. The weather has been clear since then.

Alpine Ascents' director of programs, Gordon Janow, said he wasn't ready to release information about the climbers.

Saturday
 afternoon, rescuers spotted camping and climbing equipment at 9,500 
feet on Carbon Glacier, but there is no word at this time if the gear 
belongs to the missing party.
