Holland midfielder Wesley Sneijder is literally fighting fit for the start of the World Cup after enlisting the help of kickboxer Gokhan Saki to get him into shape.

The Dutch maestro was given permission by his club Galatasaray and national team coach Louis Van Gaal to train with Saki in Istanbul, where he is based during the domestic season.

And the results have been remarkable, with Holland’s physios in disbelief at Sneijder’s high level of fitness when the national side got together at the end of May.

‘Thanks to him, I got back to my optimal weight, like when I was 22,’ said Sneijder. ‘In terms of footwork and agility, I am back to my old level.

‘It was explosive training,’ said Sneijder. ‘It has made me more explosive over the first few metres. I feel that I have benefited from it.

‘However, I have not got fit just through the workouts [with Saki]. I also played a lot of matches after the winter break.’

When Van Gaal began his second spell in charge of Holland in 2012 he took the captain’s armband from Sneijder and gave it to Robin van Persie.

And last year the 29-year-old was dropped by Van Gaal, prompting serious doubts over whether he would be recalled for this summer’s tournament.

‘With hindsight I can see that Van Gaal was right,’ agreed Sneijder. ‘I was not working enough. My level had gone down.’

Earlier this month Van Gaal welcomed Sneijder’s return to fitness but added, ‘he must prove that he can again be the superb player he was in 2010.’

The Galatasaray midfielder won further praise from Van Gaal during their training camp in Portugal last week.

‘I read that it was thanks to me, but it’s really thanks to him,’ said van Gaal. ‘If he keeps this form, he can bring a lot to the team.

‘With him, Robben and van Persie, the Netherlands has one of the best potential strike forces in the world.’

In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, Saki explained how he had helped the former Inter Milan midfielder arrive at Holland’s training camp in peak physical condition.

‘I’m really happy for him,’ said the 30-year-ol, who is a two-time Dutch and European Muay Thai champion.

‘A few months ago he was in a real slump, but now he is out of that. I hope and think he’s going to do well at the World Cup. He is one hundred per cent ready.’

Saki is flying to Brazil to assist Sneijder during the tournament. ‘I will take my training gear. When Wesley needs me, I am ready for him. But since he is physically in good shape, he will be able to focus.’
