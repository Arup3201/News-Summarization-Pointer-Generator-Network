A teenage girl who was given a ten percent chance of survival after a horrific accident has returned home and is set to attend school for the first time in months.

Mathilda Vazille was struck by a car and flung into a brick wall at a notoriously dangerous intersection on Sydney's northern beaches in May of this year.

The horrific crash - which took place on Warringah Road in Narraweena - left the 13-year-old in a coma and bedridden in hospital for many months following.

'The doctors and nurses had very little hope I would survive, and even if I did, I'd be completely brain damaged', Mathilda told The Daily Telegraph.

However Mathilda, now 14, has made a miraculous recovery and will return to Stella Maris College this week, according to the newspaper.

The crash took place when the teen and four of her friends were on the way to meet a group when their bus broke down. The girls are said to have got off the vehicle and walked as they were not far from their destination.

Just days after the accident Bella Amato and Chiara Tisamo, who were right behind Mathilda when she was crossing Warringah Rd, revealed to Nine News the moment they witnessed their friend being hit.

'She kind of went about like three or four metres up in the air and flipped and she went head first and hit a brick fence,' Bella said.

This week the teenager will return to school after spending weeks in a coma after the accident and the months following in rigorous rehabilitation 

'I thought I was imagining everything and I looked at Chiara and just went like – "did this happen?"'.

The girls explained how they were crossing the road when the pedestrian lights turned from a clear green to a flashing red, but Mathilda carried on crossing.

'You just have that instinct to just keep running because she was so close to the path,' Chiara said.

Meantime, Mathilda's father Francois was in Singapore when he was told about his daughter's accident. Mr Vazille described his trip back to Australia as 'the longest flight ever'.

'I didn't even know if she would still be alive when I got there,' he told The Daily Telegraph.

The schoolgirl suffered a severe brain injury and was in an induced coma while at Randwick Children's Hospital. It took more than three weeks until she began to regain consciousness.

The intersection is known to be dangerous and has been the scene of many accidents before it 

Mathilda said the first thing she remembers after the accident was waking up in hospital thinking she was having a nightmare, and trying to bite herself so she would wake up.

Following this she had to learn to breathe, speak, eat, and walk again during her intense four months of rehabilitation.

Mr Vazille described his daughter's recovery as miraculous, while Mathilda is looking forward to returning to normal life.

Though there's a long way to go still she hopes to be back to her old self within the next two years, and despite all the challenges Mathilda said she is happier and more appreciative of her life now.
