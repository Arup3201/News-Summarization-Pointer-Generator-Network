The NHS has launched a review after a reindeer was taken round a number of wards at a children's hospital.

The 'tame' fawn was outside the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Yorkhill, Glasgow, as part of a planned charity event in the run-up to Christmas when a member of staff decided to take the animal inside.

The reindeer, which was hand-reared and vet-checked,  visited some of the wards to allow more youngsters to see and pet it, but the health board said the reindeer had no contact with any patients in isolation.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde described the incident as 'well intentioned', but said the decision was taken without the permission or knowledge of managers or senior clinical staff.

In a statement, it said: 'As such we conducted an internal review to learn lessons.

'At no time did the fawn urinate on a child and appropriate infection control procedures were taken with those children who petted the animal.

'The reindeer fawn did not go into any isolation cubicles or have contact with any patient in isolation.'
