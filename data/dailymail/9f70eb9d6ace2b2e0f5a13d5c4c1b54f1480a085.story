A City banker and his wife have appeared in court to fight a fine for withdrawing their son from school to attend a memorial service.

James Haymore, 34, and his wife Dana Haymore, 32, are accused of failing to ensure the regular attendance of their 11-year-old son, Toby, at Chancellor Park primary school in Chelmsford, Essex.

The couple argue their son’s unauthorised absence came about as the family had been attending a memorial service for Toby’s great grandfather in America.

James Haymore and his wife Dana, pictured arriving at court, are embarking on a test case to argue that a ban on taking children out of school during term time breaches their human rights

Mr Haymore, an account manager at global financial services firm JP Morgan, appeared alongside his wife at Colchester Magistrates’ Court for a brief hearing today where they both denied the charge.

The couple could face a fine of up to £1,000 if found guilty of the offence.

Today, Natasha Taylor, prosecuting, told the court: 'Toby Haymore is a Year Six pupil of compulsory school age.

'Between November 4 last year and March 21 this year he attended school on 146 occasions out of a possible 168.

'This represents an attendance rate of 87 percent.

'Part of these absences were related to unauthorised term time holiday.'

The court heard the couple, who live with their three children in Chelmsford, Essex, will argue the £120 fine breaks their Article 8 right to a family life under the European Convention of Human Rights.

The two-day trial is due to be heard at Colchester Magistrates’ Court on October 10.

Former education secretary Michael Gove played a key part in tightening school absence rules.

Since September last year absences in term time can only be authorised in ‘exceptional circumstances’.

The Government has insisted that its reforms to deal with school absence are starting to have an effect (file picture)

Parents of children aged five to 16 are legally responsible for ensuring they attend school regularly - unless they are home educated.

Headteachers, social workers or police can issue parents penalty notices of up to £120 if a child regularly misses school, and their parents have not taken action or asked for help.

If this is not paid, a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £2,500, a three-month jail term or a community sentence.

Council officials say that, aside from their education suffering, children who are often absent find it harder to sustain friendships, and are more likely to get involved with crime.

Various options are available to headteachers, social workers or police including issuing parents with penalty notices between £60 and £120 if parents have not taken action or asked for help.

If this is not paid, a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £2,500, a three-month jail term or a community sentence.

The Government has insisted that its reforms to deal with school absence are starting to have an effect.

Under the changes, truancy fines have risen from £50 to £60, and from £100 to £120 if they are not paid within 28 days. Guidance on school holidays has also changed, with headteachers now only granting permission for term time trips in 'exceptional circumstances'.

Earlier this year, Sally Randall, 35, landed herself with a criminal record after taking her son to Majorca during term-time to say goodbye to his dying grandfather.

She pleaded guilty to a truancy charge when she appeared at Blackburn Magistrates’ Court, Lancashire.

In February Nicola Duke was one of three parents prosecuted for failing to ensure their child attends Furness Academy in Barrow, Cumbria, and was fined £500 along with £120 of other costs.

And in May, a 10-year-old girl was refused time off from Hansbury Farm Primary School, Tamworth to attend her grandfather's funeral - because the reasons for her absence did not amount to 'exceptional circumstances'.

Gaynor Hodge, 39, and her husband Leigh, 41, sent in a leave of absence form asking for their daughter Demi to be allowed two days off during term time so she could attend the service.
