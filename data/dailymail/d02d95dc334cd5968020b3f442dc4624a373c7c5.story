A Tory Cabinet minister today invites Ed Miliband to join forces to end the human rights ‘madness’ keeping Abu Qatada in Britain.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling says the system has gone ‘badly wrong’ when the UK cannot deport a man ‘who so obviously despises what we stand for’.

Writing in the Daily Mail, he says that the Conservatives would change human rights laws immediately – but they do not have the votes needed in Parliament.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said his party would change human rights laws but need Ed Miliband's cooperation

Ministers are being thwarted by their Liberal Democrat Coalition partners who have vowed to fight even modest changes to the law. But, in an audacious move, Mr Grayling is appealing to the Labour leadership to ‘support radical reform of our human rights laws’.

He urges: ‘We have given up far too much of our own sovereignty.

‘We have given up too many of our own democratic rights. We need to reverse the changes.’

Mr Grayling’s offer, which could result in immediate legislation, places Mr Miliband in a hugely difficult position.

Labour grandees, including ex-Home Secretary John Reid, have warned that the Qatada debacle is undermining faith in the entire human rights regime.

Lord Reid said: ‘The danger in the  long run is that if people believe the law as it stands . . . is open to misuse, then the demand grows to throw out the whole thing.’

But, while helping to reform human rights law would be hugely popular, Mr Miliband would need the courage to carry his party with him.

Many Labour MPs view the Human Rights Act – passed by Tony Blair  in 1998 – as an article of faith which  cannot be touched. Mr Grayling wants to legislate for a ‘dramatically curtailed role for the European Court of Human Rights in the UK’.

One option is to prevent the court from overriding the clearly expressed wishes of the UK Parliament.

Labour has repeatedly sniped at the Government over the failure to boot out Qatada, but has not said how it would tackle the issue after spending six years trying – and failing – to kick out the hate-filled cleric while in government.

Last week, the Appeal Court ruled that Qatada could not be deported to Jordan on terror charges in case his right to a fair trial was breached.

The judges accepted Qatada was ‘very dangerous’, but said this was ‘not a relevant consideration’ under human rights laws.

The decision – which raises the 
chilling prospect of Britain being stuck with the fanatic for life – was
based on an earlier ruling by Strasbourg.

Mr
Grayling’s Daily Mail article  delivers a devastating analysis of the 
problems the legislation – working in tandem with the European Court of 
Human Rights – is causing for the Government. He says the remit of the 
European Court has ‘gone mad’.

Former Home Secretary John Reid warned that the Qatada debacle is undermining faith in the human rights regime while Theresa May wants to leave the agreement to make it easier to deport foreign terrorists

But he says it is for politicians to change the law, and reaches out  to Labour and the Lib Dems to find a solution, rather than limp on to the 2015 General Election without change.

He says: ‘I would welcome an agreement from Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband to support radical reform of our human rights laws. We would deliver those changes at the earliest possible opportunity.’

The Qatada ruling has renewed demands for radical action. Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant said Britain must leave the European Convention on Human Rights in the wake of the defeat. Home Secretary Theresa May also wants to leave the agreement to make it easier to deport foreign terrorists and criminals.

Yet, last week, justice minister Damian Green said the official position is that no preparations are being made to walk away. The statement reflects how the Tory Party is having to bend over backwards to keep the Liberal Democrats happy.

In his LBC radio show last week, Mr Clegg said the Government remains determined to deport Qatada, but would not be prepared to ignore the court’s ruling.
