The trial of a man accused of owning a dangerous dog which savaged his former partner's baby girl to death has been postponed because experts have not been able to identify the breed of the animal.  

Lee Wright, 27, was charged with possessing an illegal fighting dog after 11-month-old Ava-Jayne Corless was attacked by the dog on February 10 this year while she was sleeping at Wright's home in Blackburn.

The girl was attacked by the animal while Wright and her mother Chloe King were downstairs. They tried to prise the child out of the animal's jaws but she died of her injuries in hospital.  

The trial of Lee Wright, accused of owning a dangerous dog which killed an 11-month-old child, has been adjourned because experts cannot identify the breed of the animal which savaged the girl in Blackburn

Police believe the dog, called Snoop, was a pit bull terrier type animal but Wright denied the charge, claiming it was an American Bulldog.

Blackburn Magistrates' Court heard that experts struggled to identify the breed and type of the dog due to an 'invasive post-mortem' soon after the incident.

Chrissie Hunt, prosecuting, said the post-mortem took place while Wright was being interviewed by police.

She said: 'The decision to conduct a post-mortem at that stage may have been premature but in order to continue with the investigation, it was the only way forward.

'But degradation occured during the post-mortem.

'It is not impossible to ID the type of dog from photographs but it is certainly a more difficult case.'

Ava-Jane Corless was mauled to death by the dog in February in Blackburn and died of her injuries

Pit bull terriers are on a list of dogs banned in the UK, along with a Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino and Figa Braziliero. 

Wright is on trial charged with possession of a fighting dog contrary to section 1 (3) & (7) of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. 

The trial was adjourned until December 2. 

Wright, from Blackburn, Lancashire, was released on bail.
