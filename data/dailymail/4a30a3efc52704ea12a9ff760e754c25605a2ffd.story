Boris Johnson was branded a liar yesterday in the growing row over his £100billion plan for an airport in the Thames estuary.

Sir Howard Davies, head of the independent Airports Commission, reacted angrily after Mr Johnson criticised his decision to reject plans for a so-called ‘Boris Island’ airport.

The London Mayor claimed on Tuesday that Sir Howard had told him privately that London would need a new airport by 2020 even if Heathrow was expanded.

He criticised the ‘myopic’ decision to reject his plan, and suggested the Commission had been leant on by risk-averse Whitehall pen-pushers.

In a frank response yesterday, Sir Howard said most of Mr Johnson’s assertions ‘are actually untrue’.

He told The Times that the suggestion he was doing Whitehall’s bidding by rejecting ‘Boris Island’ was ‘a complete lie’.

‘I think he is not looking carefully at the analysis and I think that’s what he’d be better advised to do rather than produce conspiracy theories’.

The Mayor’s office declined to comment on Mr Davies’s intervention.

Mr Johnson was also under pressure on a separate front last night after two Tory MPs urged him to show some ‘political courage’ by standing against Ukip in next month’s Clacton by-election.

Hendon MP Matthew Offord and Carlisle MP John Stevenson said Mr Johnson should demonstrate his ‘willingness to play for the team’ by taking on defector Douglas Carswell in his Essex homeland. 

Opinion polls suggest Mr Carswell, who stunned Westminster by defecting to Ukip last week, is on course for a crushing victory over his former party in the October 9 by-election.

But writing on the grassroots Tory website ConservativeHome, the MPs suggest there is a ‘real possibility’ that Mr Johnson could confound the polls and achieve a morale-boosting victory if he throws his hat into the ring.

Mr Johnson is bidding to become the candidate for the safe Tory seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, in West London, but could, in theory, also apply for the nomination in Clacton.

Mr Offord and Mr Stevenson say winning in Uxbridge would be ‘no great achievement’ for Mr Johnson and suggest he has a duty to try to save the Conservatives from a ‘potentially seismic’ defeat in Clacton.

They write: ‘For Boris, this is an opportunity for him to step up to the plate, show his political courage, fight for the Conservative cause and clearly set out his willingness to play for the team. Were Boris to win, he would clearly have demonstrated his continuing ability to win difficult elections, as well as his ability to attract voters outside London.

‘For us, Boris has been an outstanding Mayor of London, but there have been doubts over his suitability as a potential future leader of the party. A win in Clacton could change that.’

Mr Johnson has dismissed suggestions he might stand in Clacton, saying he has already ‘whacked in’ an application to stand in Uxbridge.
