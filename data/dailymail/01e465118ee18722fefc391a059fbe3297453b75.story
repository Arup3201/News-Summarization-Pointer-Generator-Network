A High Street bank may stop asking customers for their mother’s maiden name to avoid confusing account-holders with two dads, it was reported last night.

A review of RBS’ ‘inclusion’ policies aimed at gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender customers could also include introducing the gender-neutral ‘Mx’ instead of the traditional Mr, Mrs, Miss or Ms, it emerged last night.

Bank staff are also being trained in speaking to customers who inform them they are changing gender, according to the Times.

RBS staff may be told to stop asking customers for their mother's miaden names to avoid confusing account-holders who may have two fathers 

The bank’s global head of inclusion Marjorie Strachan said questions about maiden names would be tough for those with two mothers or fathers.

She todl the Times: ‘We are looking at unconscious bias. If we think about something as simple as using neutral language, that can be a good starting point.’

And of the ‘Mx’ title, she said: ‘We have considered it. It’s something we’re looking at as one of the options, although we’ve usually followed the same nomenclature that the census would use.’

Speaking about addressing customers undergoing a gender change, she said: ‘We recognise it can be extremely upsetting if a customer who is undergoing gender re-assignment walks into a branch and doesn’t have an easy option in explaining their needs.’

Other High Street banks - Lloyds and Barclays - are also looking again at the way they speak with gay, lesbian and transgender account-holders.

A Lloyds spokesman said: ‘We continually review our policies and procedures in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity to ensure we are meeting the needs of our LGBT customers and colleagues.’

Lloyds said it was also reviewing the way it speaks with gay, lesbian and transgender account-holders 

A spokesman for Stonewall, the gay equality campaign group, told the newspaper: ‘The best businesses in 21st-century Britain are ones who respond to the needs of all their customers, that includes LGBT people, people with two dads or people who change their gender.’

Last week, Antonio Simoes, the openly gay UK chief executive of HSBC, urged business leaders to be more open about their sexual orientation.

He said: ‘We’re in London, we’re in 2014. It’s not acceptable that we take for granted all the work done by others on issues such as marriage equality.

‘There’s a huge personal responsibility to come out and to be out.’
