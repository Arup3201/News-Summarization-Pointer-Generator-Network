He's been out of prison less than one year following his role in helping to mastermind Hollywood's notorious 'Bling Ring' burglaries, but Nick Prugo was again arrested on Friday for allegedly violating parole.

According to TMZ, Prugo was seized by authorities in LA after police received information on him from skin specialist-to-the-stars Dawn DaLuise, who remains in custody for allegedly plotting a murder-for-hire scheme.

DaLuise - a facialist who has counted Jennifer Aniston and Sarah Michelle Gellar as clients - is accused of hiring a former Detroit Lions player to kill a competitor of hers who had set up shop on the same street as her Santa Monica beauty salon, Skin Refinery.

Following her arrest earlier this month, it emerged that DaLuise had sent text messages to a friend, Edward Feinstein, 28, saying she was setting up a fake Craigslist profile that would send strange to the home of her rival, Gabriel Suarez.

Back to jail?: Nick Prugo, who is on probation after serving time for his role in leading the Bling Ring burglaries, could be headed back behind bars after being arrested for allegedly violating parole

DaLuise created the online account pretending to be Suarez, inviting men to his address saying there was 'no need to call first' and that he would be waiting in bed with a blindfold on.

In a bizarre twist, Feinstein was subsequently arrested for allegedly cyber stalking DaLuise, after he allegedly made flyers with a sexually explicit photo of DaLuise's face, home address and phone number and distributed them publicly.

DaLuise believed that the person who made the ads about her was Suarez - and the threat to her and her daughters' safety was her motivation for the murder-for-hire plot, she has claimed.

She was charged last week for solicitation to commit murder and is currently being held on $1 million bail.

But during her police interrogation, she told police that Feinstein's housemate was Prugo, who had recently violated his parole by leaving the state.

Police investigated and then made their arrest, TMZ reported.

Prugo was released from jail in April 2013 after serving 12 months.

His two-year sentence was reduced was cut in half for  'good time' and 'work time' credits.

The 'Burglar Bunch' break-ins that he lead with former best friend Rachel Lee netted more than $3 million in jewelry, high-end clothes and art, most of it from Paris Hilton, when a group of fame-obsessed high school students robbed a slew of celebrity homes in 2009.

The clan struck a who's who of Hollywood stars, including Audrina Patridge, Lindsay Lohan, Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr, as well as Brian Austin Green and Megan Fox.

Their story was portrayed and slightly fictionalized in Sofia Coppola's 2013 film The Bling Ring.

Prugo was depicted by actor Israel Boussad, whose character was called Marc.

Following the release of the film, Prugo told The Huffington Post that he was happy with how the movie turned out, after meeting with Coppola while she was writing the script.

He said all but one scene, which shows him wearing hot pink stilettos stolen from Hilton's home, occurred in real life.

He has also said that the robberies start to help fund his cocaine habit, which was not shown in the film.

The movie was based on a Vanity Fair article written by Nancy Jo Sales, The Suspects Wore Louboutins.
