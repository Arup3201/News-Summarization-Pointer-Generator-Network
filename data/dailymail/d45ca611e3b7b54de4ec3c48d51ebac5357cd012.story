A Brooklyn tattoo artist has been criticized by animal rights groups after he inked a design on his dog while it was sedated at the vet.

Mistah Metro, who works for NY Ink star Chris Torres, posted an image of his dog on Instagram, showing the animal still under sedation after having surgery.

But his tattoo has led to backlash online, with animal lovers condemning Mistah Metro for marking the dog for his own amusement.

Ink: Artist Mistah Metro tattooed a heart on his dog while she was under sedation after having an operation

Mistah Metro, who works at the Red Legged Devil tattoo parlor Torres opened after starring in the hit reality show, put a red heart with an arrow through it, and the names Alex and Mel, on his dog's shoulder.

In a boastful Instagram post, he wrote: 'One of the many reasons my dog is cooler
 than yours! She had her spleen removed yesterday and the vet let me 
tattoo her while she was under.'

Although it is not illegal to tattoo a dog, the ASPCA condemns the practice for anything other than identification purposes.

'Tattooing an animal for the vain sake 
of joy and entertainment of the owner without any regard for the 
well-being of the animal … is not something the ASPCA supports,' a spokesman for the group told the New York Post.

Torres, who has tattooed actors and musicians including Marky Ramone and Anna Paquin, also moved to distance himself from the tattoo, saying his shop played no part in it.

'The dog wasn’t tattooed at the shop - what [employees] do on their own time isn't my business,' he told the Gothamist.

Torres opened the tattoo parlor where Mistah Metro works, after the reality show he featured in came to an end. Clients pay up to $200 an hour to get a tattoo there.

Animal welfare scientist Emily Patterson-Kane, of the American Veterinary Medical Association added: 'We can't say a tattoo is going to do enormous damage to an animal, but we do look at whether a procedure is therapeutically necessary first - if it's not, that's not the vets goal.'

Many Twitter users were appalled by the tattoo, calling for the dog to be taken away from his owner and making threats against Mistah Metro.

'How does a vet let u tattoo ur dog while still under anesthesia?? Pic is either edited or you're sick & shouldn't have a dog!' @MTLCanadiensTV tweeted.

'I can't believe you're a tattooer and I genuinely hope you never work again,' another Twitter user, @xsylveon, said.
