Beijing has launched an intense security operation on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the bloody military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests.

A stepped-up police presence is visible on the city's streets, while dozens have been detained in the run-up to the anniversary of the 1989 crackdown, as China moves to block any public commemoration.

A number of Google websites in China have also been blocked ahead of the 25th anniversary of pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.

It is thought the Chinese Government has been targeting Googleâ€™s search engine, alongside YouTube and Twitter, to block access ahead of dates the ruling party considers sensitive.

China allows no public discussion of the 
events of June 3-4, 1989, when soldiers accompanied by tanks and 
armoured personnel carriers fought their way into the heart of the city,
 killing hundreds of unarmed protesters and onlookers.

A system 
known as the 'Great Firewall' is being used to stop internet users 
accessing information ahead of the anniversary, not just in China but 
also on overseas versions of Google.

Google has said the four-day block in China will 'severely disrupt' its online presence in the country.

The search engine giant said on its website:
 'The 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square incident is coming. This 
highlights another fierce battle in the war between China censorship 
authority and information flow.'

Today 
police manned checkpoints, and officers and paramilitary troops 
patrolled pedestrian overpasses and streets surrounding the square.

The
 increased security comes on top of heightened restrictions on political
 activists, artists, lawyers and other government critics.

Dozens have been taken into detention, forced out of Beijing or confined to their homes in other parts of the country.

Jiangsu
 province-based environmental activist Wu Lihong said in a text message:
 'June 4 has come again and the plainclothes officers are here to 
protect us. I can't leave the house to travel or lecture.'

Artist
 and former activist Guo Jian was also taken away by authorities on 
Sunday night, shortly after a profile of him appeared in the Financial 
Times newspaper in commemoration of the crackdown's anniversary.

As he was being detained, Guo, an Australian citizen, said he would be held until June 15.

A
 writer and officer of the Independent Chinese PEN Center, who writes 
under the name Ye Du, was also taken from his home in the southern city 
of Guangzhou to join a forced 'tour trip', his wife Wan Haitao said by 
phone.

Such
 compulsory trips are a common method of keeping government critics 
under 24-hour watch without the need to initiate legal proceedings.

In
 an apparent sign of government nervousness, connections to the global 
Internet appeared to have been disrupted, with Google's mail and other 
services mostly inaccessible.

China 
already routinely blocks popular overseas social media sites such as 
Twitter and YouTube and heavily censors Chinese sites for 
politically-sensitive content.

'Regarding 
the political incident which happened in the late 1980s in China, as 
well as issues related to it, the Chinese government reached a 
conclusion a long time ago,' Mr Hong said before launching into a 
defence of China's economic reforms that have created a burgeoning 
middle class amid relative political stability.

He also denied cases of political persecution, saying: 'In China, there are only law offenders.

The so-called dissidents as you mentioned do not exist.'

Authorities regularly tighten security ahead of June 4, but this year's suppression is notably harsher than in the past.

Activists
 who previously received no more than a warning have been taken into 
custody and police have told foreign journalists they would face 
unspecified serious consequences for covering sensitive issues ahead of 
the anniversary.

A
 French broadcaster said its journalists were interrogated for six hours
 by Beijing police when they were found interviewing people on the 
street about the events 25 years ago.

The government has never issued a complete, formal accounting of the crackdown and the number of casualties.

Beijing's
 official verdict is that the student-led protests aimed to topple the 
ruling Communist Party and plunge China into chaos.

Protest leaders said they were merely seeking greater democracy and 
freedom, along with an end to corruption and favouritism within the 
party.

Asked
 about the crackdown at a regularly scheduled news conference, Chinese 
foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei did not refer directly to Tiananmen 
Square or the military crackdown.

Despite 
China's discouragement, the crackdown is recalled with rallies and 
commemorations in Chinese communities worldwide, especially in Hong 
Kong, a former British colony that has retained its own legal system and
 civil liberties since returning to Chinese rule in 1997.

Thousands
 marched through the city on Sunday in remembrance of the crackdown, and
 organisers said they expected about 150,000 people to join a 
candlelight vigil in a city park tomorrow.

In
 Beijing, college professor Wang Dongcheng said he had been warned by 
the authorities not to speak to foreign media and posted a few spare 
lines of poetry on his microblog.

'Tonight,
 I will remain silent,' wrote Mr Wang, who attended a private seminar on
 the 1989 events last month that resulted in the detention of well-known
 human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang and four others.

'Tonight, I will listen in solitude. Tonight, I will be sleepless.'
