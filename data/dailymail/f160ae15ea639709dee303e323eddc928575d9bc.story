Hilary Mantel booked a place in history by becoming the first author to win both the Costa Book Award and the Man Booker Prize in a year

Hilary Mantel made literary history last night by becoming the first author to win both the Costa Book Award and the Man Booker Prize within a year.

The author picked up the £30,000 Costa Book Award for her novel Bring Up The Bodies - three months after winning the Man Booker prize with it.

The book is the second in a planned trilogy about the turbulent life and relationships of King Henry VIII’s advisor Thomas Cromwell.

The first book in the trilogy, Wolf Hall, was awarded the Man Booker in 2009, making Miss Mantel, 60, the first UK author to win the Booker Prize twice.

Last night chair of the judges, Radio 4 presenter Jenni Murray, said the panel had been unanimous in its decision to select Bring Up The Bodies from the shortlist of five books.

She insisted Mantel’s previous success had not affected the decision, but that it was ‘simply the best book’.

‘One book stood out on head and shoulders - more than head and shoulders, on stilts above the rest and that was Hilary Mantel,’ she said.

She praised the author’s writing style, saying her words were ‘poetry’.

‘It is so poetic, so beautiful, it is set in its time but it is also incredibly modern,’ she added.

Dame Jenni said she had read every book on the shortlist on both her Kindle and in published form and that old-fashioned books were full of ‘pleasures’ missing from new technology.

Other books on the shortlist included a comic-style graphic memoir about James Joyce’s daughter, Dotter of her Father’s Eyes, by husband and wife team Mary and Bryan Talbot, and children’s book Maggot Moon by dyslexic writer Sally Gardner.

The Costa Award was formerly known as the Whitbread Award and was established in 1971 to promote the enjoyment of reading.

Past winners include Ted Hughes, Seamus Heaney and children’s author Philip Pullman. Last year’s winner was historical novel Pure by Andrew Miller.
