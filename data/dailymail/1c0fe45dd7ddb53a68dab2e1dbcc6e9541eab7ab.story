Arsenal forward Benik Afobe has signed a three-and-a-half year contract with Championship club Wolves.

The 21-year-old had been on loan at MK Dons since the beginning of the season, and scored 19 goals in 30 matches for the League One outfit to help them reach third.

But the England Under-21 international completed his move to the Molineux for an undisclosed fee on Wednesday and left the Barclays Premier League club he first joined 15 years ago.

'It feels fantastic. It's been a long process with the medical, I've never had to do a medical before but that's all done now, hopefully I can start training on Thursday and get ready for the game on Saturday,' Afobe told Wolves' official website.

'The facilities here are fantastic. You can see that it's a club that deserves to be in the Premier League.

'It's just about getting there and hopefully we can do that. I just want to say that I'm happy to become a Wolves player and I can't wait to get going.' 

And manager Kenny Jackett believes Afobe has an 'exciting future' at Wolves.

'He's had a good upbringing where he's well thought of and well rated and they've always been very keen to progress him,' Jackett said. 'I'm sure they'll be pleased now he gets his opportunity at a good club like Wolves.

'We were keen to make him feel wanted and make him the best he can possibly be and try to bring out his full potential, which is considerable, both in terms of his play, his power and his goalscoring.

'He gets chances and converts a good percentage of them. 

'He's over his injury now – it's been a year since his cruciate – he's had spells at Sheffield Wednesday and MK Dons and I feel he's built up his confidence, built up his fitness and looks ready for someone to give him a permanent home and the backing that can bring out the best in him.

'I took him briefly to Millwall but he was a very young lad then and it was a few years ago. 

'But he has the pace and the power for the division, he's got a very good goalscoring record as well, and, after a number of loans, he's ready now for a permanent home.

'He's got a good base of experience behind him to start with us, but we also feel giving him a permanent home can really bring out the best in him and at 21 it's an exciting future.' 

Afobe never featured in a Premier League game for the Gunners, and had been sent on loan to Huddersfield Town, Reading, Bolton, Millwall, Sheffield Wednesday, then MK Dons since 2010.

His stand-out moment came in the Capital One Cup for MK Dons when they beat Manchester United 4-0, with Afobe scoring two of the goals against Louis van Gaal's team.
