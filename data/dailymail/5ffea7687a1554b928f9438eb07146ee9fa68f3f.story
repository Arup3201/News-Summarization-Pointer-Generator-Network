One of the ‘moles’ Prince Charles is alleged to have placed in Government was seconded to the Cabinet Office and worked as private secretary to a minister close to David Cameron.

It was reported yesterday that 30-year-old Laura Osbaldeston was a senior research officer at Clarence House before she moved to the Cabinet Office on a two-year secondment.

During her time there, she was promoted to the role of private secretary to Nick Hurd, the Minister for Civil Society.

Three members of the Prince of Wales’s staff have taken secondments at either the Cabinet Office or the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs over the last five years.

MPs have accused the Prince of planting ‘moles’ in Government departments and have claimed that they were there to advance his private interests.

This latest revelation sparked further claims that the Prince of Wales was meddling in Government and abandoning the tradition of royal neutrality in politics – with Labour MP Paul Flynn describing him as a ‘constitutional crisis in waiting’.

Neither Clarence House nor the Cabinet Office would confirm that Miss Osbaldeston, a Cambridge graduate, was the employee who had moved between them.

Miss Osbaldeston’s LinkedIn page says she started work as a research assistant in a ‘private household’ in 2007 before being made senior research officer.

While she was there, she took part in 
several Clarence House charity events and was one of a group of 
‘Charlie’s angels’ who did a 26-mile walk for cancer charities in 2009 
and raised £17,538.

She then joined the Cabinet Office in 2011 on a two-year secondment, and progressed to the role of private secretary to Mr Hurd. She has now returned to Clarence House.

A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said last night: ‘The idea that there was a mole or a spy is complete nonsense. They were a junior member of staff on secondment.’

A spokeswoman for Clarence House said the three secondees were junior members of staff, aged in their 20s, who would not have come into contact with the Prince very often.

She pointed out that the staff made their own requests for experience in government departments for their own professional development reasons.

‘We have had two secondments to government departments in the past two years,’ she said. ‘The secondments were suggested on the basis of professional development and the paperwork was arranged by the relevant HR departments.

‘One secondment was one year and the other was for two years. Both have come to a natural conclusion. There was no official feedback mechanism and no regular meetings were attended with the Prince of Wales’s household.

‘The secondments were on a like-for-like basis. One secondee has now left Clarence House and the other is due to return shortly after a sabbatical.

‘Over the past five years, in addition to the two secondments already discussed, there has been one other secondment, for six weeks to the Cabinet Office. We have no new secondments planned at present.’

The revelations come a week after the Mail disclosed that the Prince of Wales has had 36 private audiences with Cabinet ministers since the election - one a month.

Alongside seven meetings with the Prime Minister, he also met a disproportionately high number of ministers from departments representing issues of personal interest to him, including the environment, alternative medicine and town planning. It raised questions over whether the Prince was lobbying for his pet issues.

But Clarence House robustly defended the summits, saying it was his right and duty to meet any minister ‘he chooses’. They also said some meetings were requested by the ministers rather than the Prince.
