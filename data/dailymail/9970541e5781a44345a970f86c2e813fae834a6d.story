A new book claims that former French President Francois Mitterrand's death was assisted suicide

Former French President Francois Mitterrand was given a fatal intravenous injection to end his suffering at his own request, a new book revealed.

Mitterrand,  the only socialist President of the Fifth Republic from 1981 to 1995 and an opponent of euthanasia, died in his eightieth year in 1996.

He had been suffering from cancer for fifteen years but his illness remained a closely guarded secret whilst he was alive.

His personal doctor Claude Gubler revealed in a book named ‘The Great Secret’ published after the President’s death that Mitterrand had suffered cancer during the whole of his Presidency and that in his last year in power he was ‘incapable of carrying out his Presidential duties’.

Dr Gubler also maintained that he had been forced to falsify the President’s health bulletins giving him a clean bill.

The book was banned and Gubler was later struck off, given a suspended jail sentence and publicly dishonoured on the orders of succeeding President Jacques Chirac.

Claims: According to the new book current French president Nicolas Sarkozy, left, takes pills which have not been 
given 'authorisation by public health authorities' while former President Chirac suffered a secret stroke while in office

According to the latest revelations in a book by  two French journalists Denis Demonpion and Laurent Léger, the fatal injection that ended Mitterrand’s life was administered in the presence of a mystery woman who afterwards informed the President’s doctor.

Incendiary: The new book about the health of French presidents

Mitterrand’s son Gilbert was quoted in the book as saying that ‘ only one person knows what happened and she will say nothing about it’.

‘She just told us that his death had occurred peacefully’, he said.

Francois Mitterrand’s widow Danielle died last November at Verdun aged 87.

In their book Demonpion and Léger also claim that Nicolas Sarkozy, standing for relection to the Presidency in 11 days, also ‘ takes pills which have not been given ‘authorisation by public health authorities’.

The authors  do not specify the exact nature of the pills but claim they are intended to restore 'aplomb' or self- possession.

Other claims are that Jacques Chirac suffered a stroke whilst in power in 2005 and his wife Bernadette and daughter Claude took pains to prevent news of it leaking out and that former Prime Minister Edouard Balladur suffered from intestinal cancer after his premiership.
