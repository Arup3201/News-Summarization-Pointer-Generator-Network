Here's spaniel Benny taking a stroll in blustery conditions at Grève de Lecq, Jersey

It's a sight that would frighten even the most ardent dog lover.

Balancing on his hind legs with his ears standing on their ends, Benny the spaniel unwittingly acquired this new 'devil dog' look while strolling on his local beach.

The brave pup was caught in a strong gust of wind and almost blown away during blustery conditions at Grève de Lecq in Jersery.

He was captured on camera by Sophie Dale, who sent the photograph in to local paper the Jersey Evening Post.

Reporters put the picture online and the image soon went viral, with thousands flocking to see Benny's frightening new look.

Paul Allitt wrote on Facebook: 'That is one crazy photo love it.'

Joyce Riddett added: 'He could audition for the dame in next year's panto!! lol... But he's so cute... Great pic!!'

It comes as forecasters warned that the on-going rain which has flooded parts of Britain in recent weeks will be joined by freezing temperatures and snow this weekend.

Weather experts said the rain will continue as freezing temperatures set in, with a high chance of snow in the north.

MeteoGroup forecaster Laura Caldwell said: 'We will have colder temperatures, dropping to below freezing on Saturday evening, and snow across the hills in north England and reaching the ground in Scotland.

'But come Sunday, the rain will return in the south.'
