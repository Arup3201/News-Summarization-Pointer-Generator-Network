Allergy medicine is known to unblock noses, but it could also help to loosen and wipe bad memories, Swiss scientists claim.

Diphenhydramine, which is the antihistamine ingredient in Benadryl, plays a role in blocking the recall of painful, haunting memories in humans, according to a new study.

The research could have have huge implications for people who have lived through a traumatic experience and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Almost eight million people are plagued by bad memories and have the disorder in the U.S. alone, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Geneticists from the University of Basel, Switzerland believe tiny traits in a person's genome might be to blame.

They compared the genomes of 2,500 healthy, young volunteers who had completed an emotional memory performance test and found a cluster of gene traits that were common in the volunteers who more easily recalled painful memories, Medical Daily reported.

The scientists them cross-checked the traits with a list of commonly used drugs to see if any of them had a positive effect on helping to block bad memories.

Eliminating compounds known to trigger unhelpful side effects, the geneticists focused on a set of nine gene-drug pairings.

The research could have have huge implications for people who have lived through a traumatic experience, such as soldiers at war, and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder

Concentrating on these nine genetic traits, the scientists looked at biological data from a group of 340 holocaust survivors.

By studing this group of people, the scientists aimed to finally target a single gene that was found to be linked to the recall of bad memories and discovered it is the gene for histamine receptor H1 (HRH1).

This is the same gene that when overstimulated by allergies, triggers a runny nose and even asthma in certain people.

To test whether allergy medication could block negative memories, 40 individuals took diphenhydramine and were asked to recall upsetting events in their lives.

The scientists discovered that while the drug reduces the recall of bad memories, it had no effect on neutral and happy recollections.

Professor Andreas Papassotiropoulos, of the Psychiatric University Clinics at the university, and co-lead author of the study, said: 'The rapid development of innovative methods for genetic analysis has made this new and promising approach possible.

'In a further study, we will try to identify and develop memory enhancing drugs,' he added.
