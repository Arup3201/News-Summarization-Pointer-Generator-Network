MPs accused of expenses fraud will be protected by secrecy under rules unveiled last night.

The expenses watchdog wants to withhold the names of those under investigation to save them from ‘reputational damage’.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which has outraged voters with plans to raise MPs’ pay by 10 per cent, also wants to bar the public from hearings.

MPs will not be named while they are under investigation for allegedly fiddling their expenses, under new plans

The authority claims that investigators will find interviews with MPs and their assistants ‘more instructive’ without public scrutiny.

The proposals were condemned last night as foolish and perverse by the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life.

Sir Alistair Graham said the public had a right to know that their MP was under suspicion, especially after the parliamentary expenses scandal.

‘To introduce measures which undermine transparency is foolish and perverse at a time when we are looking for increased transparency,’ he added.

‘This means that MPs will be able to string out the thing for as long as they like rather than everyone knowing there is an issue to be investigated.

‘This is a retrograde step when you consider that it was a lack of transparency which led to the expenses scandal in the first place.’

IPSA's former compliance officer Luke March, who had refused to release names of those being investigated on the basis it was ‘unfair’

John O’Connell, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Yet again, Ipsa has demonstrated itself to be thoroughly out of touch with the public. Transparency must be the watchword and if it insists on keeping probes secret it will undermine the whole point of setting up the organisation.

‘It must rethink these proposals or taxpayers will deem IPSA totally unfit for purpose.’

When the first IPSA rules were drawn up they indicated that the names of MPs under investigation should be released routinely when probes were launched.

But initially, the body’s compliance officer, Luke March, refused to do so on the basis it was ‘unfair’ to those under scrutiny. He subsequently resigned and in 2011 the body concluded that identities should be made public during formal investigations – rather than afterward.

That means constituents are able to look on the watchdog’s website to find whether their MP is accused of wrongdoing. But in the latest proposal, published yesterday, new compliance officer Peter Davis declares that the ‘public interest in transparency must be balanced with operational needs and fairness’.

‘On balance, we believe that the operational and reputational damage to MPs which could be caused by the publication of allegations in advance of a substantive investigation outweighs the benefits of release,’ the proposal states.

‘The compliance officer is likely to find discussions with MPs, staff and others more instructive and the evidence of a better quality when the discussions take place without the public scrutiny that accompanies press investigation. For this reason we plan now to amend the procedures so that the compliance officer is required to publicise the findings of all investigations as soon as practicable after its conclusion.’

Under the existing rules, the compliance officer is obliged to ‘take reasonable steps’ to allow members of the public to attend formal hearings into alleged wrongdoing by an MP.

But the document states that no MP has asked for a hearing ‘because any MP is likely to judge that the benefits of the hearing would be outweighed by the possible publication of the details of the case’.

A fortnight ago it emerged that MPs are pocketing even more in expenses than they did under the old rules. Last year they took £103million in allowances against £102million in 2008

The proposals raise further question marks about the expenses regime set up after leaked documents in 2009 showed widespread fiddling by MPs.

Only a fortnight ago it emerged that MPs are pocketing even more in expenses than they did under the old rules.

Last year they took £103million in allowances against £102million in 2008.
