Prison staff are to be issued with stab-proof vests to wear round the clock under plans being considered by ministers.

An urgent review is being carried out into giving frontline staff ‘covert clothing’ to protect from knife attacks launched by prisoners.

The number of prison assaults involving knives has doubled in a decade, with staff at risk of being deliberately attacked by inmates or getting caught up in fights.

The idea of giving all prison staff stab-proof vests marks a significant u-turn, coming just two years after the government insisted it was not necessary.

Protective vests and gloves are usually only used when trouble breaks out in jails or if prison officers believe there is a serious threat to their own safety.

Last year there were 246 assaults on staff and inmates in prisons in England and Wales involving a knife or blade, up from 127 in 2002.

There were also 126 attacks involving a sharp instrument and 325 using a blunt instrument.

Last year there were 2,987 assaults on staff, a figure which has remained stubbornly high for the last five years.

As recently as December 2011 the government insisted there were ‘no plans’ to routinely equip all prison officers working in prisons with stab-proof vests.

But now prisons minister Jeremy Wright has revealed that the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) which runs the country’s jails is now ‘assessing the benefits and feasibility’ of issuing vests routinely.

He insisted that there NOMS has a ‘zero tolerance approach to violence within prisons and takes the safety of prison staff extremely seriously’.

Mr Wright added: ‘Staff must be able to undertake their duties safely and be, as far as possible, protected from attack.

‘NOMS is currently assessing the benefits and feasibility of issuing front-line prison staff with covert clothing for routine wear, including vests which offer protection from knife slashing or stabbing.

‘Knife-resistant vests and other protective clothing are already provided to staff where a particular risk has been identified, including to specialist staff responding to serious incidents.’

He was responding to a parliamentary question from Tory MP Mark Menzies, who also urged ministers to consider the use of slash and needle-proof gloves by all prison guards.

Mr Wright replied: ‘Slash-resistant and needle-resistant search gloves are currently available for staff use and local risk-assessment at individual prisons determines how widely they are used.

‘Work is on-going to identify further suitable products which may benefit prison staff in conducting routine searches.’
