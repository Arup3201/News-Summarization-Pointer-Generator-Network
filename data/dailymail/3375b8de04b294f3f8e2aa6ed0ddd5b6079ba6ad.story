If you think you've managed to sneakily park in a disabled parking spot lately, think again.

You may have ended on the Australian Disability Parking Wall of Shame Facebook page with hundreds of other drivers who have parked in disability spots without a permit.

The Australian Disability Parking Scheme helps eligible people park nearer to their destination, as well as help reduce the abuse of permits.

But angry drivers have posted photos ranging from shoppers taking up two disable spots to non-permits parked outside of fast food chains and shopping malls.

One posted a picture of a p-plater parked in front of KFC in Queensland: 'Young teen at schoolies sat inside KFC for 40 minutes while parked there not caring and laughing about it all'

One photo shows a man casually drinking and standing outside his parked Peugeot car in a disable spot, while a few others taking up two spots outside shopping malls.

Adding to the so called 'wall of shame,' people are also using disable spots to 'sell their vehicle' as one user said: 'This van has been parked in a disabled space in Haymarket Sydney for well over a month.

'It does have a valid disabled permit in the window, its allowed to sit there indefinitely and take up a parking space that no-one else can use. The council has told me there's nothing at all that they can do about it. Makes me kinda angry though...'

An anonymous member said: 'My father-in-law has contacted centre management, local council etc and still no action has been taken. This was first bought to our attention last Tuesday when my wheelchair dependent mother-in-law wanted to shop at Millers in the new centre.'

Another user added she had a child with autism, which entitles her family to use a pass when she's with them.

Sara Hassan posted: 'One had the audacity to yell that my daughter didn't look 'disabled enough' to be entitled to one. We need to educate the public that a perfectly 'normal' looking person can still have a handicap that entitles them to having a pass.'

Thousands of Australians have taken to the 'name and shame' page to post photographs of drivers who park in disability parking bays without permits

Despite all the awareness for parking to help people with disability, one user also suggested that another page should be considered for 'people who use the disabled toilet facilities who shouldn't.'

Wendy Cramley posted on the page: 'I was at Warringah Mall shopping centre and had to wait for 10 minutes before some guy came out. When I told him that it was a disabled toilet he said that he "couldn't care less because it suited him to use the bigger toilet and that I should go f**k myself."
