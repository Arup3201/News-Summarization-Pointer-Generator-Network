This real life big bad wolf forced the residents of one Dutch town to keep their doors firmly shut.

In a scene that could have come straight out of one of the Grimm fairytales the large grey animal was spotted peering into gardens as it stalked the streets.

But instead of threatening to huff and puff and blow their homes down the hungry animal was looking for scraps of food after travelling over 300km.

The huge grey wolf was caught on camera running along a residential street in the northern city of Kolham, which is normally packed with children and family pets.

Eyewitnesses told how it strutted along the road for around 30 meters, stopping from time to time to look into gardens.

Although running at a brisk pace, those who saw it said it did not seem dangerous and was possibly looking for a new home.

Wolves have not been seen in the Netherlands for more than 150 years. 

Local experts believe it may have travelled to the city from Germany - up to 300km away.

Oguz Acioz, 35, who spotted the animal while driving to work called the police.

The salesman said: 'The last wolf was seen here about 150 years ago.

'I was about a meter behind it. I could see the mouth and the teeth and I knew it wasn't a dog so I started filming straight away.

'I was so surprised. You never see one of these on a street. It's not a normal sight.

Wolves have not been seen in the country for more than 150 years, according to animal experts

The animal was believed to have travelled into the country from Germany

'Luckily, there was nobody on the street as everyone had gone to work. Normally there are lots of children around and chickens in back gardens.

'I looked at it in the eyes. It seemed hungry.

'I wasn't scared. I wanted to see him. I thought he might need help.

'It was seen crossing the boarder [with Germany] on Friday. There is a picture of it and it is the same wolf.

'People think it might have been looking for a new home or mate. It ran a long way.' 

The wolf was believed to have been captured by police and returned to Germany.
