Rasheda Ali-Walsh, the daughter of Muhammad Ali, says her father is 'doing fabulous' as he battles pneumonia in hospital.

The former heavyweight champion,72, was admitted to a Kentucky hospital with a mild case of pneumonia at the weekend.

But his spokesman today said Ali's doctors hope to discharge him soon, and Rasheda, 44, told DailyMail.com her father is recovering well, adding: 'He's doing fabulous, he's quite remarkable.'

Prayers: Rasheda Ali-Walsh says her dad is 'doing fabulous' and that she hopes to see him for Christmas

Rasheda - one of Ali's nine children, who has a twin daughter Jamillah- added: 'We're all so pleased that he's recovering, he's quite the champion.

'We're going to see him in a couple of days over Christmas and I'm looking forward to it, you never know with pneumonia, but we're going to see him and I want to thank everyone for all of their prayers.' 

Ali spokesman Bob Gunnell said today that Ali's doctors hope to discharge him soon from the hospital where he was admitted on Saturday, adding his condition had 'vastly improved'

'Because the pneumonia was caught early, his prognosis is good with a short hospital stay expected.' Gunnell said.

Ali and his wife, Lonnie, have homes in Arizona, Michigan and in Louisville.  

Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, was diagnosed with the brain disease about three years after he retired from boxing in 1981.

Ali's public appearances have diminished in recent years as he continues to battle Parkinson's disease, but he still enjoys getting out and watching sports and visiting friends.

Ali appeared in public in September at a ceremony in his hometown of Louisville for the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Awards. Ali did not speak to the crowd but posed for photos with award winners, including former NFL great Jim Brown.

Brown leaned over and whispered to the seated Ali during the photo session. Later, Brown said he told Ali: 'You're the greatest of all time.'

Ali retired from boxing in 1981 and devoted himself to social causes. He traveled the world on humanitarian missions, mingling with the masses and rubbing elbows with world leaders.

Ali received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George W. Bush in 2005.

The Muhammad Ali Center, in Louisville, is dedicated to Ali's humanitarian causes and showcases his boxing career.
