Luis Suarez is currently Public Enemy No 1 as the villain of the hour at this World Cup but where does he really rank in the all-time Rogues Gallery?

In most lists of men and women who have blackened their sports by cheating on the field of play or horrendous misconduct off it, the names of Lance Armstrong, Ben Johnson and Diego Maradona are invariably the big three.

By such populist judgement Uruguay’s chomper at bits of his opponents would not make the top 20 in historical context. Not in the long term rather than in this very immediate heat of the moment.

Ain't that the tooth: Suarez reacts after biting Chiellini (seated) at the World Cup clash in Natal

It is when absolute moral criteria are applied in the proper order that Suarez not only nibbles his way into the reckoning of shame but gnaws his way above the syringing cyclist, the steroid sprinter and the snorting goal-scorer.

There are four degrees of scandal  – drug abuse, match-fixing, plain cheating and the deliberate inflicting of grievous bodily harm.

In my estimation the latter is by far the most serious and the big six in this list reflect their gravity in this culpability.

Below them the places of shame are shuffled among the other classes of offenders, taking into account not only the extent of the negative impact on their sports but, even more importantly, how they shattered our dreams.

These ratings also reflect an element of British interest since the nearer it hits to home, the closer to the bone.

20) FRED LORZ

To start,, one to give us a much chuckle. In 90-degree heat at the 1904 St Louis Olympics, which reduced the 32-man field to 14 finishers, this New Yorker covered a mountainous marathon course in just three hours and 13 minutes.

Alice Roosevelt, daughter of the president, was about to present him with the gold when it was discovered he had ridden 11 miles as a passenger in his manager’s car.

Comical: Fred Lorz made history at the 1904 Summer Olympics when he quit running the marathon and decided to grab a lift in his manager's car instead - it broke down and he walked the remaining six miles... many thought he won

19) STEPHEN LEE

Snooker’s carefully cultivated image transformation from dingy, smoke-filled gambling halls to gleaming TV arenas took a hit when, in 2012, Lee was hit with a 12-year ban for match-fixing.

Shamed: Snooker player Stephen Lee was handed a 12-year ban in 2012 after being found guilty of match fixing

18) TOM WILLIAMS

Rugby preens itself as a game for thugs played by gentlemen. Not after Bloodgate. Cheating with blood replacements was exposed when Harlequins winger Williams (bit on a capsule to fake a mouth injury in a Heineken Cup tie against Leinster.

Bloodgate: The world of rugby was shocked after Harlequins' Tom Williams bit a capsule to fake a mouth injury

17) TIGER WOODS

What happened in Las Vegas didn’t stay in Las Vegas. The role-model image of the greatest golfer in the world fell between the gambling tables and the ladies of the Strip. He admits he has never been the same since. Nor has the game that made him so famous.

Villain: Golf star Tiger Woods publicly admitted to cheating on his wife Elin Nordegren in 2010

Suffering: The all-conquering American maintains that he has never been the same since the scandal

16) MICHAEL ATHERTON

When England cricket captain Atherton was fined £2,000 for  having dirt in his pocket at the home of the game during a Test match against South Africa, it shook Lord’s to its foundations.

Shook to its core: England cricket captain Mike Atherton kept dirt in his pocket to tamper with the ball during a Test match against South Africa in 1994 at Lords... he was fined £2000

15) MICHELLE SMITH de BRUYN

Irish eyes were smiling when, at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, their darling swimmer won their first three Olympic gold medals ever — then crying when she was banned for four years after tampering with her urine sample.

That deepened suspicions about the influence of husband and coach Erik de Bruin, a Dutch discus thrower previously suspended for steroid abuse.

Stripped: Michelle Smith de Bruin won three Olympic gold medals for Ireland in 1996, only to be banned for four years after tampering with her urine sample... her husband and coach was previously suspended for steroid abuse

14) ALEX RODRIGUEZ

Most expensive baseball player ever when bought by the New York Yankees, but became the poster-boy for steroid-abusing  sluggers. A-Rod has been fingered, also, for betraying his team-mates by tipping off opposing hitters as to what pitches to expect.

'Poster boy': Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees admitted taking performance-enhancing drugs

13) BORIS ONISCHENKO

Ukrainian pentathlete went home in disgrace from the 1976 Montreal Olympics after being outed by British rivals Adrian Parker and Jim Fox for the most bizarre of all these offences — electronically wiring his sword to score hits in the fencing discipline even when it failed to make contact.

Bizarre: USSR's Boris Onischenko was sent hom from the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games after he electronically wired his fencing sword to score hits in the pentathlon... here his epee is checked by an official

12) SHOELESS JOE JACKSON

The all-time great baseball player was accused of involvement in the worst controversy to blight America’s Game, when the Chicago White Sox sold the 1919 World Series to Cincinnati Reds for a bribe of $5,000 a man — known as the Black Sox scandal. One sobbing boy famously put into words the sentiment of millions of heartbroken young fans when he begged Jackson outside the court: ‘Say it ain’t so, Joe.’

Say it ain't so, Joe: Chicago White Sox's Shoeless Joe Jackson was accused of his involvement in throwing the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds after receiving a $5,000 bribe

11) DIEGO MARADONA

Usually cited for his Hand of God goal against England but listed here not for this form of cheating which, sadly, is common-place in football, but for being expelled from the USA World Cup of 1994 for the ephedrine doping which set a terrible example for his millions of young worshippers.

Two counts: Diego Maradona scored this 'goal', dubbed the Hand of God against England at the 1986 World Cup

Scandal: Maradona scored in the 1994 tournament for Argentina... but was then expelled after failing a drugs test

10) MARION JONES

The most infamous cheat in women’s athletics, Jones was forced into admitting the use of performance-enhancing drugs at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and was stripped of her five medals.

At her peak: Marion Jones was a women's sprinting icon after winning the 100m at 2000 Sydney Olympics

Tearful: But she was forced to admit taking performance-enhancing drugs and was stripped of her medals

9) BEN JOHNSON

Shocked the world by winning the 100 metres at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul by the length of a street. Then he shocked the world again by testing positive for steroids and being stripped of his gold.

Comfortable: Ben Johnson easily won the 100m in 1988 in Seoul, he later tested positive for steroids

8) HANSIE CRONJE

Of all people to open the worm-can of cricket match-fixing, South Africa’s puritanically religious captain was the most unlikely. Yet in 2000 he was found guilty of collaborating with Asian bookmakers during a tour of India. He died in a light plane crash three years later, still banned, still in denial.

Captain shock: South Africa's Hansie Cronje was found guilty of match-fixing in 2000, he died three years later

7) LANCE ARMSTRONG

After years of denials, the cyclist finally confessed that those record-breaking Tour de France triumphs were fuelled by steroids. Also betrayed the millions of devoted fans who admired him for the phenomenal willpower that had raised him from a cancer deathbed.

Record breaker: But Lance Armstrong admitted all those Tour de France titles were fuelled by steroids

The truth: Armstrong sat down with masseuse Emma O'Reilly and Sportsmail's Matt Lawton for an exclusive interview last year

6) LUIS SUAREZ

Football’s serial biter whose latest sinking of the fangs was into Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini in Brazil. More than enough said.

New entry: Luis Suarez is a definite on this list after he bit Giorgio Chiellini in the World Cup match last month

Painful? Suarez was banned for four months and nine international games... he has only just apologised

5) ANTONIO MARGARITO

Had plaster of Paris taped onto his knuckles for a world-title fight in 2009, turning his fists into sledgehammer-like weapons. He could have killed Sugar Shane Mosley and his ban took into account suspicions that it had happened before.

Sledgehower like weapons: Antonio Margarito (right) had plaster of Paris taped round his knuckles during his fight against Shane Mosley in 2009

4) HARALD SCHUMACHER

The worst of all football’s  assaults saw Germany’s keeper hurtle out of his area in the 1982 World Cup semi-final in Seville and fling his body at Patrick Battiston as the Frenchman was through on goal.

Battiston was feared dead but responded to oxygen and was taken to hospital in a coma, with shattered vertebrae and broken teeth.

Sickening: Harald Schumacher ploughed into Patrick Battiston during the World Cup semi-final in 1982

Sorry sight: The French defender was feared dead... no foul or card was given to the West Germany keeper

3) MIKE TYSON

In sport’s most outrageous  biting incident, 17 years ago last weekend Iron Mike chewed off Evander Holyfield’s ear in a world heavyweight title fight in Las Vegas — confirming his deliberately  cultivated image as The Baddest Man on the Planet.

Take that Luis Suarez: Mike Tyson bit a chunk off Evander Holyfield's ear during a World Heavyweight title fight

2) TONYA HARDING

Such are the pressures on adolescent ice maidens that this sweet little missy from Portland, Oregon grew up so desperate to win the 1994 US figure skating championships and thereby qualify for that year’s Winter Olympics that she and her ex-husband commissioned an iron-bar knee-capping of her main rival Nancy Kerrigan.

Bitter rival: Tonya Harding was so desperate to win the US figure skating championships in 1994 that she commissioned an attack on main rival Nancy Kerrigan, seen suffering below

1) OJ SIMPSON

The iconic all-American hero transcended gridiron and became an idol around the world. He was acquitted of the murder of his former wife and her male friend but a civil court found him guilty of  their wrongful deaths.

Simpson is serving time in prison after being found guilty of armed robbery and kidnapping in 2008.

It doesn't get any worse than this... OJ Simpson was acquitted of charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and friend Ron Goldman, but a civil court later found him guilty

Shocking: The former American football player holds his hands up to the jury, wearing the infamous gloves

Heartbreak: Simpson, who was later an actor, poses with his arm round his wife in 1993
