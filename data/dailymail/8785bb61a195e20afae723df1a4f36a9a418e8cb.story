The family of a British hostage who has been threatened with beheading by the terror group Islamic State (IS) have pleaded to the militants to contact them in an effort to save his life.

David Haines has been held prisoner for more than a year in Syria, but it was only earlier this month that the world learned of his captivity when he was seen in a video released by IS.

The same video appeared to show the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff. Then in the final seconds, a gaunt and hollow-eyed Mr Haines is seen being clutched by the collar of his orange robe by a masked man with a British accent, who warned that further air strikes will lead to the British aid worker’s death.

Fears are growing for aid worker David Haines after he appeared on his knees in a jihadi video. His family revealed last night that they have tried to contact the group holding him but have had no reply

Mr Haines' second wife, Dragana Prodanovic Haines (pictured), has previously said she cries for her husband 'every day' but refuses to tell their four-year-old daughter of his capture

Last month the same masked man – dubbed ‘Jihadi John’ – was seen in a video showing the apparent killing of US journalist James Foley, 41. 

Before his death, Foley spoke to the camera saying that the US air raids had signed his ‘death certificate’. 

Mr Haines’s family have made several attempts to contact IS, which now controls large swathes of northern Syria and Iraq, but so far without any response.

In a statement released through the Foreign Office, the family said: ‘We are the family of David Haines. We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.’

Mr Haines, from Perth, has a 17-year-old daughter, from a previous marriage, in Scotland. He also has a four-year-old daughter in Croatia with his current wife, Dragana Prodanovic Haines. 

Mrs Haines revealed last week that she ‘cries every day’ for her husband, and has not yet told her daughter of his capture.

Mr Haines has been a lifelong aid worker in war-torn regions such as Libya and South Sudan. He was working for Acted, a French aid agency, at Atmeh in Idlib province, northern Syria, when he was kidnapped at gunpoint in March 2013.

The US has not stopped bombing IS targets in Iraq since the Sotloff video came out, and last week President Obama said he may expand the bombings to target the terror group in Syria.

David Cameron reaffirmed the British Government’s policy of refusing to pay ransoms to terrorists.

The IS terrorist known as 'Jihadi John' has already executed two U.S. journalists, James Foley (pictured) and Steven Sotloff, and threatened that Mr Haines will be next

IS did not say when Mr Haines would be executed if their demands were not met, but on jihadi social media accounts it is rumoured the video of his execution will be released by Saturday.

Although the Foreign Office refused to say what steps it is taking to have Mr Haines released, it reiterated the Government’s stance that it does not pay ransom.

A spokesman said: ‘Our policy is longstanding and clear. We do not make substantive concessions. But we will talk to groups and individuals who we feel might be able to help save lives.’

Federico Motka, an Italian aid worker, was also kidnapped with Mr Haines. Motka, 31, was freed in May after his government apparently paid millions of pounds to IS to secure his release.

Last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed that Mr Haines was tortured in captivity with Tasers, and was singled out by his captors for brutal treatment because he was British.

He developed severe vomiting and diarrhoea, and his health became so dire that his captors called a doctor.

He was held hostage along with Foley and Sotloff and other Westerners by a group of British IS members known as ‘the Beatles’, with one believed to be Jihadi John.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said the Foreign Office will be doing 'everything' they can to protect Mr Haines. 

The relief agency Acted has previously said that the threats made to the Scotsman's life were 'intolerable'.

In a statement, it said: 'Acted strongly condemns the violence and threats against David. A man's life should never be threatened on account of his humanitarian commitment.'
