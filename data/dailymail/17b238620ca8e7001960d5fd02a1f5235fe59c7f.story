A 14-year-old who was born a boy but diagnosed with gender identity disorder aged just three has told how difficult it is to date despite her stunning looks.

Jazz Jennings, from Florida, who does not want to reveal her birth name, opened up about liking boys but admitted the opposite sex won’t talk to her and some even call her ‘it'. 

Now at high school, the fashion-conscious youngster, who has written a book and launched a charity about her ordeal, has spoken about the difficulties of finding love and says the response she has had from her peers has left her feeling deflated.

Jazz Jennings, 14, has told of her fears on joining the high school dating scene after admitting that some of her classmates won't speak to her while others refer to her as 'it'

Born a boy, Jazz told her parents that it felt like she'd been 'born in the wrong body' and was diagnosed with gender identity disorder at the age of three. Pictured left, aged five months, and, right, aged two

Jazz said: 'I like some boys in my class at school but no one likes me back.

'It upsets me, I worry it's because I'm not pretty. But my friends tell me I'm attractive.

'My friends started chatting about boys they fancied but Mum warned me not to join in, in case I was teased.

'She thinks I need to wait until I'm older to start thinking about relationships. But I know one day I'll find someone who likes me for who I am.'

Now Miss Jennings is paying attention to boys, mum Jeanette Jennings, 48, is conscious for her safety.

She said: 'I do worry now she's getting older. I've told her if she ever goes on a date she needs to tell the boy beforehand. I'm worried someone could turn on her, maybe even attack her if they found out further down the line.

'I won't let Jazz go to other people's houses if the whole family isn't aware of the situation.'

Following her diagnosis, Jazz, pictured aged six, transitioned and started living as a girl full-time aged five

Miss Jennings plans to have full gender reassignment surgery after she turns 18. She said: 'The hardest part of being transgender is still having male genitalia. It reminds me I wasn't born in a female body.

'When I grew my hair and started wearing girls' clothes, it felt right. I've been teased by some schoolmates, but I've learnt to rise above it.

'I already feel like a girl but when I have the gender reassignment surgery my transition will be complete.'

Although Jazz's mum and dad were worried about Jazz's behaviour at the start, since her diagnosis as a toddler, they have been unwavering in their support.

Mrs Jennings said: 'We're so proud of her. We listened to Jazz and let her be the person she wanted to be. 

'It was hard at first, but we saw how much happier she was living as a girl. Sometimes I mourn the loss of the idea of my son. But there's a wonderful person with us now and Jazz knows how special she is.'

Miss Jennings, who has twin older brothers, Sander and Griffin, both 16, and a sister Ari, 19, has 'longed to be a girl' from ever since she can remember and never referred to herself as a boy.

She said: 'Mum tells me that even as a two-year-old when she praised me for being a good boy, I'd correct her saying, 'I'm a good girl.

'As a toddler I wanted to wear girls' clothes and I'd play with Ari's dolls.

Jazz founded the TransKids Purple Rainbow Foundation which has led her to meet a host of celebrities including transgender actress Laverne Cox, left, and Hollywood starlet Jennifer Lawrence, right

'When I was two, Mum says I asked when the fairy was going to come with a magic wand and take away my penis.'

Mrs Jennings and her husband, Greg, 47, realised it was not a phase and went to a paediatrician for advice.

Miss Jennings said: 'The doctor showed me male and female dolls and asked me to point to which one I was. Straight away, I pointed to the female doll. I was the youngest patient the paediatrician had seen.'

They advised Mrs Jennings to follow her daughter's lead but not to encourage her.

But she was still adamant she was a girl and when she came in from nursery she would change into one of her sister's dresses or her favourite fairy outfit.

Aged three, Miss Jennings was diagnosed with gender identity disorder after tests and counselling.

Following her diagnosis, she gradually transitioned and started living as a girl full-time aged five.

She said: 'I grew my hair, had my ears pierced and wore dresses. I felt so happy.

'My brothers and sisters accepted it and even though my dad struggled at first, both my parents were really supportive.'

When Miss Jennings started approaching puberty, she was anxious about nature taking its course.

She said: 'I had nightmares about growing facial hair and I hated the thought of my voice dropping and my body becoming more masculine.'

Aged 11, she was prescribed hormone blockers to stop the production of testosterone, so she would not go through male puberty.

'It was such a relief,' she said. 'The hormone blockers are reversible, so if I come off them I'll go through male puberty. But there's no way that's happening - I'm too happy as a girl. I love experimenting with different hair styles and going clothes shopping.'

Jazz, pictured aged seven, revealed she knew she wanted to be a boy when she was aged just three

While her family were happy with her transition, there were pupils at her school who were less understanding.

Miss Jennings said: 'Some children asked why I was dressed like a girl when I was born a boy. I'd say I felt as though I'd been born in the wrong body.

'But at lunchtime some of the girls wouldn't sit with me and some of the boys even called me 'it'. When I got home I'd cry.

'I wasn't allowed to use the boys' or girls' toilets, I had to go to the nurse's office to use the bathroom. I felt so isolated.'

Although she does not get attention from boys at school, she gets messages from others across the globe.

She said: 'A lot of straight and transgender boys get in touch with me through my website and social media. 

Miss Jennings hopes to settle down with a family one day but currently she's using her experience to help others through the transition.

She has founded the TransKids Purple Rainbow Foundation and written a book I Am Jazz about being diagnosed with gender identity disorder.

An advocate of transgender rights, Jazz's campaigning work has led her to meet a host of stars including Laverne Cox, the transgender star of Orange is the new Black and Hollywood A-Lister Jennifer Lawrence.

Miss Jennings said of the meeting: 'I'm a huge Hunger Games fan so it was amazing to meet Jennifer, she couldn't have been nicer and said I was an inspiration.'

The youngster has also spoken at schools, hospitals and universities on the subject.

She said: 'I want to show people they don't have to be scared of being different. I hope to stop discrimination against young transgender people.'
