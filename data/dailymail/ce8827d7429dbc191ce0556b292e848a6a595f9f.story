Costa Concordia captain Francesco Schettino has broken his silence in a controversial TV interview and described the cruise ship disaster which cost 32 lives as a 'banal accident' adding that he did not believe it was 'a crime'.

Schettino, 52, is said to have been paid £55,000 for the interview which was broadcast on Italian television late on Wednesday night and the channel which broadcast it was bombarded with complaints after details of the fee emerged - although it has denied handing over any cash.

Amazingly he even described himself as 'a victim' claiming that at the time of the incident he was not in charge - although at the end of the hour long interview, he did eventually apologise for the tragedy earlier this year when the Costa Concordia struck a rock and sank off the island of Giglio.

Italian television channel Canale 5 was bombarded with complaints following reports it paid Schettino £55,000 for the hour-long interview

The luxury liner had left port two hours before the disaster for a week long Mediterranean cruise and was packed with more than 4,000 passengers and crew, including 30 Britons.

It struck a rock which was marked on charts after Schettino ordered a 'sail by salute' and came too close to Giglio.

As a result a 70 metre gash was torn in the hull of the Concordia and despite water pouring into the hold Schettino delayed giving the order to abandon ship for more than an hour.

He is currently accused of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship after it emerged he had fled the bridge and escaped on a lifeboat while dozens of passengers and crew were still onboard the 290m long Costa Concordia.

In his interview on Canale 5, owned by controversial former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, Schettino said: 'This was a banal accident in which fate found a hole right in the interaction of human beings.

'I think that as a result, a misunderstanding was created and that's why there is all this anger.

'It's as if everyone's head - just like the instruments onboard - went into a blackout. At that moment I had gone onto the bridge and given the order for manual navigation and I was not in charge, the navigation was in the hands of another officer.'

Schettino said he blamed himself for being distracted by a telephone call, adding that a 'divine hand' had then guided him saying: 'I realised that something was wrong when I spotted wash and I managed to avoid a full head on collision with the rock.'

Schettino has insisted the rock was not on charts and instruments had failed then bizarrely added: 'There is a difference between a sail by salute and a sail, when you perform a sail by salute you slow down and you sail close and you chose the right charts so you know how far you are aware from land.

'If a proper sail by salute had been had been planned then nothing would have happened.'

Holiday makers soak up the sun in the shadow of the wrecked Costa Concordia near the harbour of Giglio Porto, where the salvage operation is still underway six months after the disaster

Schettino again insisted that turning the Concordia around and heading back towards Giglio, instead of giving the order to abandon ship immediately, saved lives - although coastguards and maritime experts have contradicted his decision saying that by the time the evacuation was sounded it was listing too much and lifeboats could not be launched properly.

Schettino, who was dubbed Captain Coward after he claimed to have 'tripped and fell' into a lifeboat, faces a possible jail sentence of more than 2,500 years, and added: 'I think about prison but at the same time you have to understand "I did this so I deserve it" but I don't think a nautical accident is a crime. I don't think I committed a crime.

'That night I made choices as a captain and I still feel a captain. I just want the truth to emerge - whatever it is.'

When asked if he felt he should apologise Schettino, who was sweating profusely and had a noticeable tic, said: 'It's normal that I should say sorry as a representative of the system, to everybody. I never thought anything like this could have happened.

'My condolences and deepest sympathies are with the people who are no more, there has been a financial loss, the company and people have been affected, the captain of the ship has also been a victim of all this system but it is all insignificant compared to a mother losing her child.

'That is immeasurable but also for a captain to lose a ship is a pain that cannot be measured.'

Schettino also hit out at crew members who had accused him of having relationship with onboard hostess Domnica Cemortan and said: 'We had dinner that night. She is a friend of mine. She is a very sociable person, very nice, a friend to everyone, she is not anything else.

'At the time of the incident she was outside the bridge, she was waiting for her cabin to be prepared and then I would have given her the key.'

More than 4,000 crew and passengers were on board the Costa Concordia when disaster struck in January this year, a total of 32 lives were lost

When asked why he had abandoned the ship and refused coastguard commander Gregorio De Falco's repeated demands to go back on board he replied: 'As a captain I have never given an order that could not be obeyed, he asked me to do something that could not be done.

'The thing is that at that moment he had not thought about the fact that the ship was submerged on its right side, that I would have had to swim 300 metres, that is to say throw myself in the sea and try and keep my mobile dry because I was coordinating the rescue which was far more important.

'I never saw any one drown. A coward is someone who in a dangerous situation tries to take advantage. If I had known that the conversation we were having was going to be released the tone would have been different.'

Following his interview the website of the show, Quinta Colonna, was bombarded with angry comments towards Schettino.

One read: 'I was on the ship that night with two children and they didn't let me onto a lifeboat. Schettino and most of the crew deserve nothing.'

Another read: 'Schettino you are a coward. A captain never abandons ship. Shame on you', while others hit out at the payment he was given saying he should donate it to the families of the victims.

Schettino, from Meta di Sorrento near Naples, was freed from house arrest earlier this month after a judge ordered him to stay there following the disaster on 13 January and a pre trial hearing is due to take place on 21 July.
