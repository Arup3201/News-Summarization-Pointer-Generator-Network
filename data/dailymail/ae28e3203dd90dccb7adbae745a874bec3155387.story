A tubby tom cat has become the country's first ever feline to undergo knee-replacement surgery after vets ruled out amputating his cancer-stricken leg because of his size.

Cyrano, a 10-year-old kitty who weighs more than 20 pounds, has been helped by doctors and engineers at North Carolina State University after cancer left his left hind leg almost useless.

Surgeon Denis Marcellin-Little and  university engineer Ola Harryssonare are at the forefront of osseointegration, a process in which a prosthetic limb is fused to a living bone.

Although a British doctor carried out a full knee replacement on a cat crushed by a car in 2009, the surgery carried out by Marcellin-Little used materials more like those used for human operations.

'This is the most complex implant that NC State has made and really, in 
all honesty, that anyone has built for any situation that I know of,' Marcellin-Little, a French-born vet, told the Associated Press.

The scientists used plastic and cobalt chromium alloy implant for the operation on Cyrano, whose full name is Mr. Cyrano L. Catte II.

'It has a form of articulation that is unique - that allows the implant to bend and rotate,' Marcellin-Little said. 'The devil is in the details.'

While these implants are commonplace in dogs, a cat's small frame is harder to work with. Cyrano's damaged bones posed an extra challenge, Marcellin-Little told the AP.

The new knee was made using a laser process that hardens metal powder to replicate his tiny bones. The two interconnecting parts each measure around two inches long.

Marcellin-Little practiced the 
procedure four times on plastic models ahead of the surgery, which took 
around six-and-a-half hours to complete.

The kitty is expected to be back on his paws in about a week - but won't be catching mice just yet.

'We would like him to take it easy for 
about three months after surgery,' Marcellin-Little said. 'And then we 
will let him be himself.'

Treating the process more as a research 
project, much of the time and materials used were donated so a cost 
estimate was impossible to make. But it cost owners Sandra Lerner and 
Len Bosack around $20,000.

Speaking from the waiting room, Lerner told the AP that 'Rat Boy' is worth every penny.

'He's my child. And if it were your child, would you begrudge the money?' she said.

'I have a personal philosophy that people are, at best, equal with the other inhabitants of the planet. And I'm very, very grateful that I have the money and (am) able to do it.'

In 2009, British vets used a stainless-steel joint for Missy the cat's knee after she was knocked down by a car.

Amputation was not an option as her 
other hind leg had been broken in eight places. Doctors faced putting 
her down or finding another solution.

The hinged implant was custom-designed based on a CT scan of Missy's knee and exactly fitted her measurements in terms of the size of her bones and the range of motion of her knee joint.

It was bonded to the thigh and shin bones using cement.

At the time, Dr Fitzpatrick said: 'The most difficult thing about the operation was miniaturising the implants and matching the hinge motion to allow walking, running and jumping, which cats do a lot of.

'A human patient with a knee replacement would probably walk and maybe even run but would rarely expect to jump.'
