If you feel like you need a personal assistant to run your life, Jaguar Land Rover claims to have the answer.

Its ‘self-learning’ car monitors your lifestyle and even predicts your next move, from the daily school run to that long-overdue trip to the gym.

The mobile PA and life coach can also become so used to your schedule that it can interrogate your electronic diary to see what’s coming up - and prepare you for it.

Jaguar Land Rover's intelligent technology will be used in future models. It works by recognising the driver from their smartphone or similar device (pictured). This means that by the time the driver opens the door, the car has already set the mirrors, steering wheel and seat, and interior temperature

As a result of past actions and future appointments, for example, it can warn drivers to fill-up with petrol ahead of a school run, or will suggest they make an important phone call while on the move.

technology will be used in future models and works by recognising the 
driver by their smartphone.

Features include:

Computer software in the system not only recognises the driver and learns their habits, it can then predict their routine and changing preferences.

It will even check a calendar in advance and remind owners to take their child’s sports kit to sports day.

It then uses the information it gleans to tee them up for the day.

This means that by the time the driver has opened the door, the car has already set the mirrors, steering wheel and seat, and interior temperature to the individual’s own preferences.

It’s also smart enough to change the temperature if it is snowing or raining.

Jaguar land Rover showcased its Smart Assistant technology earlier today at its engineering centre in Gaydon, Warwickshire.

A Jaguar land Rover spokesman said: ‘The self-learning car will also know if you are going to the gym, and will have learnt that you prefer a certain temperature on the way there to warm-up, and a different temperature to cool down on your way home.

'If you always use the massage function at a particular time or location on a journey, the car will be able to predict this as well.’

He added: ‘If you are taking the children to school, the car will recognise every passenger and offer each their own preferred music, video or radio options.

‘If you usually make a phone call at a certain time or on a particular journey, the car will predict this and will offer to make the call. If you are going to be late for your next appointment, the car will offer to email or call ahead with minimal or no interaction from the driver. ‘

It also learns an individual’s driving style in a range of traffic conditions and on different types of road so the car can apply these ‘learned’ and preferred distance settings and acceleration habits.

Jaguar Land Rover’s director of research and technology Dr Wolfgang Epple added: ‘Up until now most self-learning car research has only focussed on traffic or navigation prediction.

'We want to take this a significant step further and our new learning programme means information learnt about you will deliver a completely personalised driving experience and enhance driving pleasure.’

Dr Epple continued: ‘This is important because in the future customers will still want an emotional connection and a thrilling drive - with the ability to drive autonomously when required.’ 

Jaguar also unveiled its virtual  windscreen that uses the entire screen as a display so the driver's eyes need never leave the road. Drivers on a racetrack could have 'ghost cars' projected onto the screen which they could then race (pictured), said Jaguar

He said the lessons learned by one car could be stored and transferred to future Jaguars or Land Rovers.

At the event, Jaguar also unveiled its ‘virtual windscreen’ that offers drivers a 3D image instrument cluster, and could replace the rear view mirror.

It uses the entire windscreen as a display so the driver’s eyes need never leave the road, and high quality hazard, speed and navigation symbols are projected together onto the screen.

Jaguar Land Rover is also developing a gesture control system to keep the driver’s eyes on the road, and reduce distraction by limiting the need to look at or feel for buttons and switches to press. 

This is based on touchscreens that detect the proximity of a user’s finger from around 6 inches (15cm), which means the system can be used to accurately track a user’s hand and any gestures it makes inside the car.

Drivers on a racetrack could have ‘ghost cars’ projected onto the screen which they could then race, said Jaguar.
