Tensions in Europe took on a literary
flavour yesterday as the French snatched a tiny but historically 
priceless Charlotte Bronte manuscript from under the nose of a British 
museum.

The unpublished
work, written in 1830 when she was just 14 and containing a story which
is a precursor to a famous passage in her novel Jane Eyre, was bought 
for a record £690,850 by Le Musee des Lettres et Manuscrits in Paris at 
auction.

The Bronte 
Parsonage Museum, in the literary family’s home in Haworth, West 
Yorkshire, was so keen to acquire the miniature treasure that it had 
launched a fundraising appeal before the sale at Sotheby’s in London.

Tiny tale: The colourful tale of murder and madness is part of a 4,000-word magazine with 19 pages, written by the young Bronte

It secured a £613,140 grant from the 
National Heritage Memorial Fund, leaving enough to bid up to a hammer 
price of £560,000 for the work, which Charlotte Bronte wrote to 
entertain her sisters Emily and Anne, and brother Branwell.

But
after several minutes of intense bidding against the French, the museum
team sadly had to stop when their rivals upped their offer by £20,000. The hand-written 19-page miniature magazine, called Young Men’s 
Magazine Number 2, sold for a hammer price of £580,000.

The
total sale price – including the buyer’s premium, a commission 
routinely paid to the auctioneers on top of the hammer price – was 
£690,850, well above the amount the Bronte Parsonage Museum could 
afford.

It was a new record at auction for a manuscript by any of the Bronte sisters, a Sotheby’s spokesman said.

Emily Bronte is best known for Wuthering Heights, her only novel. Anne Bronte wrote Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.

One of the tales in the manuscript is
a precursor to a passage in Charlotte Bronte’s 1847 novel Jane Eyre, in
which Mr Rochester’s insane wife Bertha, who is kept in the attic, 
seeks revenge by setting fire to his bed curtains. The Young Men’s 
Magazine Number 2 tells of a  murderer driven to madness after being 
haunted by his victim. ‘An immense fire’ burns in his head and he 
envisages his bed curtains going up in flames.

Size of a credit card: Reading the magazine requires a magnifying-glass as the entire manuscript is in miniature, the pages only 35 x 61mm

After the auction, Bonnie Greer, 
president of the Bronte Society, said: ‘This “Little Book” puts down in 
luminous prose not only the daydreams of a little Yorkshire girl, but it
also contains the seed of the work of one of the greatest writers in 
the English language, Charlotte Bronte.

‘It will not be going home, back to 
the place where it all began, the Parsonage at Haworth. Its presence 
there would have placed it not only at the heart of the proud community 
in which she was born and raised, but would have brought full circle a 
Yorkshire story, a Northern story, a British story, a world story.’

Andrew McCarthy, director of the 
Bronte Parsonage Museum, added: ‘This is unquestionably the most 
significant Bronte manuscript to come to light in decades and an 
important part of our broader literary heritage.

‘It belongs in Haworth and we are 
bitterly disappointed that scholars and members of the public may now 
not have the opportunity to study and enjoy it as part of our public 
collection.’

The 
French museum, on Paris’s fashionable Left Bank, plans to exhibit the 
manuscript next month.  It is one of the richest and most prestigious 
archives in France, and receives direct government funding through the 
country’s Culture Ministry.

Mr McCarthy said it was ‘some consolation’ that it would be on public display somewhere.

He
added that his museum would be seeking to contact the new owner with 
the hope that the manuscript might at least be loaned to it at some 
point.

The miniature 
magazine, previously owned by an unnamed private collector in Europe, 
contains 4,000 words and each of its page measures just 1.4 in by 2.4 
in.

It is one of six 
volumes in a series of miniature magazines created by the young Brontes,
inspired by a box of toy soldiers bought for Branwell by his father.

They began creating tiny books for the toy soldiers to ‘read’.

The Bronte Parsonage Museum already owns four of the others. The sixth remains untraced.
