Levi Mason was jailed for four years, after abusing his girlfriend of just three months

An 'insanely jealous' boyfriend tried to fill his new girlfriend’s eyes and ears with Polyfilla in a week of sickening abuse.

Levi Mason, 24, beat Jamie Gorman, his partner of just three months, with a broom and pressed a nine-inch knife against her thigh.

He also threatened to pour acid over her face so that 'no-one else would ever want to get with her'.

Mason, whose conduct was described by a judge as 'almost unbelievable', pressed his fingers against Miss Gorman’s windpipe and twice smothered the mum-of-one with a pillow, telling her: 'It’s horrible when you’ve got no control. Are you hot and bothered?'

The thug was jailed for four years yesterday at Liverpool Crown Court.

On handing out the sentence Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, the Recorder of Liverpool, told him: 'The physical injuries which were inflicted to Miss Gorman may not have been severe, but the mental anguish which you caused her cannot be imagined.

'The way in which you behaved during the course of that week defies humanity.'

He added: 'You are a controlling bully and you used your size to instill fear into this woman.'

The court heard how the the week of torture began at the home they shared in Birkenhead, in July.

Michael Duncan, prosecuting, told how Mason began to get 'jealous and very aggressive'.

He told the court how the abuse began when he took his partner’s phone and refused to give it back.

A hearing at Liverpool Crown Court heard about the week of abuse, that Mason inflicted on his partner

Mr Duncan said: 'He got on top of her as she was lying on the bed. He put his legs either side, pinned her down so that she could not move.

'He pushed two fingertips on her windpipe, making it hard to breathe.

'She was struggling to get free. He then grabbed a pillow, placed it over her face and pushed it on to her.

'This induced a state of panic as she fought to breathe.'

The court was also told how Mason held a lit cigarette close to Miss Gorman's skin before throwing it at her.

Judge Goldstone said: 'She was too scared to call the police and over the next couple of days you behaved as if nothing had happened.'

Two days later, after another argument, Mason poked her in the arm with a nail file and punched a door so hard it came off its hinges and then threw it.

Then, after he tried to hit her with a picture frame, he struck her three times with a broom handle. Mason again smothered her with a pillow, 'laughing as she was screaming'.

The catalogue of abuse included holding a bread knife to Miss Gorman’s face and a bowie knife to her thigh.

Mr Duncan told how Mason also tried to put Polyfilla in her ears and eyes.

Judge Goldstone said: 'To say you were jealous doesn’t do justice to the word. You are almost insanely jealous.'

'I am quite satisfied that you are quite capable of making life for a partner utterly miserable if she does not do your bidding.'

Mason, of Bedford Road, Birkenhead, admitted seven counts of actual bodily harm.

Gerald Pachter, defending, said Mason was remorseful and filled with 'shame and disgust'.
