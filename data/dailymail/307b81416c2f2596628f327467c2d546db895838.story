The excruciating moment Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles were forced to watch a male comedian dress up as the Queen and prance around on stage has been caught on camera.

The royal couple can hardly conceal their disgust in the video, filmed at an official event in Charlottetown on Canada's Prince Edward Island on Monday night.

As Canadian funnyman Wade Lynch impersonates Her Majesty, the pair remain stonefaced and grimace when the fake Queen declares: 'There are two members of our audience that call me by quite another name and that is of course "Mummy." Hello kids. Surprise.'

Unamused: The excruciating moment Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles were forced to watch a male comedian dress up as the Queen and prance around on stage has been caught on camera

Not so funny: Comedian Wade Lynch, pictured, has been doing his Queen performance for years but the skit sparked outrage on Monday night

Prince Edward Island's Premier Robert Ghiz, sitting immediately to Camilla's left, was clearly humiliated at the entertainment officials chose to dish up to their special guests.

As Lynch performs, Charles manages a less than half-hearted applause while Camilla seems to struggle even to tap her fingers on her hand in acknowledgement.

The couple mutter a few, no doubt unimpressed, remarks to each other under their breath as the cringe-worthy act goes on.

But Charles and Camilla weren't the only ones to find the performance deplorable.Â

Stonefaced: The pair remain stonefaced and almost grimaced when Lynch declared: 'There are two members of our audience that call me by quite another name and that is of course "Mummy." Hello kids. Surprise'

It was met with a barrage of criticism from the Canadian public, many of whom called it tasteless, insulting and shameful.

Lynch, who has been impersonating the Queen for years, told the Prince Edward Island Guardian he was approached by Tourism P.E.I. to do the skit in front of Charles and Camilla.

And he thought he pulled it off, telling the newspaper he felt 'a lot of the jokes landed' and that he could see the prince 'sort of nodding and chuckling.'

The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall seemed happier meeting another performer after the show - an Anne of Green Gables actress

However, the veteran actor admitted the show was cut in half. But he said this was due to time constraints.

Lynch claimed the royal couple were in on the joke and said he was surprised and disappointed when he heard about the public backlash.

The comedian added: 'If the actual Royal family was offended, I am really sorry because that was never the intention.'

The visit to Prince Edward Island was part of the prince and the Duchess of Cornwall's whirlwind tour of Canada, which kicked off on Monday.
