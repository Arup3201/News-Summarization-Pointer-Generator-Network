A four-year-old girl made a life-saving 999 call after her mother collapsed - before telling the operator about Frozen, her pet dog and Santa.

Megan Stratton has been handed an award and praised for summoning emergency crews to her mother Charlotte, 32.

Mrs Stratton had been feeling unwell before she collapsed at her home in Lowestoft, Suffolk, and started to have a seizure last Christmas.

Her husband Trevor, also 32, was out fetching some medication - but Megan knew what to do and calmly dialled 999.

The youngster gave call handler Alan Austin her address before explaining that her mother was unwell and her father was out.

When asked if she had any older siblings Megan tells the operator: 'Lulu is here with me, but she is my pet dog'.

And when asked her mother's age, she replied: 'I don't know how old she is. Because she never tells me. I want to know how old... when she's better'.

OPERATOR: Police emergency. Hello. Can you hear me?

MEGAN: She’s struggling... she had another seizure. My dad has gone to get some medicine to eat

O: Is there someone else there? Have you got a big sister? A big brother?

M: Lulu is here with me, but she is my pet dog

O: Oh. Lulu is your pet dog, is she? And how old are you?

M: Four

O: Four. You’re doing really well for four. Mummy has epilepsy?

M: No. But she has a seizures all day. Sometimes she does and sometimes she doesn’t

O: Ok what’s your name?

M: Megan

O: Megan. That’s a pretty name. And you’re four are you? I’m going to get somebody to you. I’m going to get an ambulance to you to make sure mummy is alright. Ok, is the door open?

M: The door isn’t open

O: Is she a young mummy?

M: I don’t know how old she is. Because she never tells me. I want to know how old... when she’s better

O: When mummy has these seizures. Does she lay on the floor?

M: She lays on the sofa sometimes. She’s laying on the floor now

O: Is mummy having a drink or is she just laying there?

M: Just laying there

O: We’ve got policemen coming to you. I want you to stay on the phone until police get with you alright?

M: Ok

O: And we’ve got an ambulance coming to you as well. That will come and make mummy better won’t they?

M:... I want to put the cushion back. I will talk to you in a second

O: Yeah. You go and do what you’ve got to do for mummy, but don’t put the phone down. Come back and talk... You put mummy’s head on a cushion?

M: She hasn’t got a cushion. I’ll just get her a cushion

O: Get her a cushion, yeah

M (to her mother): Mummy, cushion

M (to the operator): She’s got a cushion now

O: Have you? Well done. You’ve done really well. Megan, are you able to unlock the door so that the ambulance men can come in and see mummy?

M: No I can’t unlock it because the key is on something really high so I can’t do it...

O: We’ve got policemen coming. Alright. We may have to make a little bit of noise to get in to see mummy alright?

M: Ok... I don’t know how you can get in to see mum because my dad is out

O: That’s ok. We’ve got lots of things we can do to get in, but it may make a little but of noise... So I want you to stay on the phone to me. Who’s mobile are you on? Is it mum’s phone?

M: Yeah, its mum’s phone. Not dad’s because he’s got his with him

O: Do you need to go and stroke mummy to make sure she’s happy, because you can go and kneel down with her with the mobile. You can make sure, mummy is ok, can’t you? And still talk to me... Is mummy talking to you? Can mummy talk to you?

M: No she can’t talk when she’s struggling.

O: She can’t talk when she’s struggling. Alright. What you doing? You stroking mummy’s head or her arm?

M: I’m stroking just her back because you’re allowed to stroke her back

O: Yep. You stroke mummy’s back, just so that she knows you’re there. You’re doing really well. Really well.

M: (asks how they will open the door)

O: That’s ok. Don’t worry about us opening the door. It might just be a little bit noisy. But I’ll tell you. Alright?

M: Ok. But I won’t be able to hear you, because it is very noisy.

O: There might be just a bang when they come in, but we need to do that so we can help mummy don’t we?

M: l... I will just get my blanket ok?

O: Yeah, you go... and keep mummy warm

M: Hang on, I’m just putting it on mummy

O: You put the blanket on mummy. Keep her nice and warm

M: I’ve now done it

O: You’ve done it. Well done...

M:... she’s got nothing on her feet

O: She’s got nothing on her feet? She’s got no slippers on her feet?

M: No. she hasn’t got any bedtime socks on. It’s not really bedtime

O: Oh, no, it’s not bedtime yet. So have you covered mummy’s feet up to keep them warm?... Just keep her really warm, won’t you? And keep talkin. Keep stroking mummy’s back so she knows you’re there. Have you got your Christmas tree up?

M: Yeah... I made some baubles at my house

O: Did you? And they’re at your house ready for Santa to see?

M: Yeah?

O: And have you been eating chocolate today out of your advent calendar?

M: Yeah. But I got a Frozen one. But it’s just Elsa and Anna on

O: Wow. My little girl has got an Elsa calendar as well... Is mummy still struggling? Or is she ok now?

M: She’s not shivering. She’s still not talking. But she’s still struggling. But she’s not shivering. She’s just blinking

O: She’s just blinking is she? I think you’ve done really well. I’m going to have to tell Father Christmas how well you’ve done, aren’t I?

M: Yes. But I’m already on his good list

O:... I should think you’ll be even higher now

M: Yeah. I will be right at the top

O: You will be right at the top. You’ve done a really good job looking after mummy haven’t you?

M: What if someone else is already at the top?

O: Well you’ve just really, really done well and I’m going to make sure Father Christmas puts you at the top of the list...

M: He won’t know because he is not coming to see you or will you go in the ambulance and go to the North Pole to see him at his house?

O: I don’t know if I can go to his house but I’ve got ways of talking to Father Christmas from here so I can tell him... I can send him a special message. Has anybody knocked on your door yet my darling?

M: No

O: Are you still there?

M: Yeah

O: Right, the policemen are outside... But they may have to make a noise to come in.

M: Ok. (dog barks) Oh, that’s just my dog

Megan stayed with her mother, talked to her to keep her calm, stroked her back and fetched her a cushion and a blanket during the incident on December 15

Police and ambulance arrived at the address just as Mr Stratton returned home and his wife was given the attention she needed.

This week, officers presented Megan with the Chief Constable's Certificate of Appreciation and her mother says she could not be prouder.

Mrs Stratton has suffered from seizures in the past and had told Megan what to do if she ever fell ill when nobody else was around.

She said: 'Suffolk Police called me back and explained what she'd done and I was a bit stunned and once we knew we were really, really proud.

Megan Stratton is  pictured receiving an award and praised for summoning emergency crews to her mother Charlotte, 32

'We knew I have seizures regularly so what we do is, on the emergency button on the mobile phone, we have daddy's number programmed and the ambulance, so it was quite easy for her to do.'

Call handler Alan Austin added: 'You quite often get young children phone up, but none as calm and composed as Megan.

'It's not very often you get a four-year-old who you can talk with quite so easily, who can guide you while you guide her and it made life so much easier.'

Temporary Chief Constable Gareth Wilson also praised the youngster and said the award went some way towards recognising her bravery.

He said: 'Megan's call to police was truly exceptional to listen to - it is very rare to hear a child handle a call in such a calm manner.

'Megan gave a lot of information to Alan for a child of her age and our Chief Constable's Certificate of Appreciation goes some way toward recognising her and saying well done.'
