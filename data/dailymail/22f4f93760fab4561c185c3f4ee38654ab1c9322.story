It was a dog day afternoon in New York City today as hundreds of pups and their kooky owners paraded around in Tompkins Square Park.

Presented by Purina Beggin Strips dog treats, the 24th annual Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade in lower Manhattan was a woofing good time.

Creativity abounds at this barktacular event but it's not all fun and games.

Game of Bones: The Mother of Dragons from Game of Thrones along with her baby dragons and her friend John Snow made quite the appearance at the 24th annual Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade

Woof of Wall Street: This dog's bark might not be louder than it's bite if it manages to swindle other pups of their Best in Show prize 

The Popey: The pope left the Vatican just to make a special appearance at this year's Halloween dog parade 

Night of the living dog: This zombie and her dog with delicious brains woke from the grave to attend the parade 

Spiderdog: This furry tarantula shows off all 12 legs in this well attended dog parade in New York City 

The event is a competition and the top prize for best costume gets a purple ribbon and a brand new I-pad.

The first place winners in round one and two go home with a blue ribbon along with two tickets to see either Cabaret or The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time on Broadway.

The New York Daily News reports that these pet owners are animals when it comes to competition and some of them prepare for weeks-- even months ahead of the competition.

Some spend hundreds of dollars on hiring stylists and costume designers to dress their canine companions.

'It’s a sickness, the competitive dog scene,' jokes Jennifer-Jo Moyer, 49,  who enters her toy poodles FiFi-GiGi and Meteor.

She first entered her dogs five years ago as Snoopy and Woodstock and they adorably rode in a wooden biplane built by her husband.

New Bark City: Lady Liberty herself took all of New York City on her back as she walked in the parade 

Menswear Dog: A dog known as Menswear Dog, a 5-year-old Shiba Inu, poses for photos during the 24th Annual Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade in New York

Cerberus: Cerberus the three headed dog took a break from guarding the underworld to attend the parade 

Unipup: This adorable unicorn with wings flew down from the sky to walk on the Earth among the dogs 

Titanic: This group of cruisers made quite a splash at the 24th Annual Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade 

De los doggie: This De Los Muertos themed duo killed it at the Halloween doggie parade 

'That was huge,' she says.

'We ended up on the Today show,' she added.

Owners care a lot less about the prizes and a lot more about the media coverage.

'It’s sort of like the pet version of stage moms,' said dog owner Marin Feldman.

'You can’t be famous yourself, but you can have a dog that is.'

While this year’s winning pooch hasn't been announced yet there were certainly some highlights among the crowd.

One dog owner turned Game of Thrones into Game of Bones by dressing one pup as Khaleesi and the other as John Snow.

The parade attracted all types of attendees including the Woof of Wall Street who took a moment away from the office to attend the parade.

Even the Pope made an appearance and was dressed in his finest attire.

The undead rose from the grave to walk in the parade as well.

A zombie and her pup , who proudly wore its brain on the outside for all to see, stunned the thousands of spectators.

It's hard to pick a favorite when they're all furtastic!
