Under investigation: Teacher Courtney Speer, 31, has been accused of having sex with a 17-year-old student in her school parking lot

A teacher has been accused of having sex with a 17-year-old student in her school parking lot.

Courtney Speer, 31, is also alleged to have had sex with the teenager at her home after striking up the illicit relationship.

She resigned from her job as an English teacher at Bryant High School in Bryant, Arkansas, on Monday after police began investigating the allegations.

Speer is due to hand herself into police today to face four counts of sexual assault.

Police said the 17-year-old victim said his first sexual encounter was with Speer in the high school parking lot in her car in June.

He told investigators they had a total of four encounters, including one occasion at her home.

Sgt Todd Crowson said: 'He told them of four occasions, four encounters he had with her at the Bryant parking lot, high school parking lot in her car.

'She was actually scheduled to come in and speak with the investigators today. She did retain an attorney and the attorney did contact the investigators and advise them that he would have her there first thing in the morning to turn herself in.'

Police said they don't know if more students are involved but Lt Kevin Russell with Benton Police said more charges could be coming from both departments.

He added: 'To hear this about a teacher who is in a position of trust over students, it is not just from a law enforcement perspective but from a parent's perspective, it is kind of disheartening.'

In Arkansas, Sexual Assault is a class-A felony and carries a sentence of between six and 30 years in prison.
