It's often one of the most expensive - and important - purchases for any bride, so going snowboarding in a £2,000 wedding dress would sound like the stuff of nightmares for most women.

However, for newlywed Rodica Havrestiuc, 25, and her husband Adrian, 24, it was the perfect way to top off their big day. 

The couple, who live in Belleville, Michigan, donned their wedding attire as well as their snowboarding gear for a novel photoshoot at Mount Holly ski resort.

Not your traditional photoshoot! Rodica and Adrian strike a mid-air pose on a snow-covered mountain

Adrian says: 'I've been into snowboarding since I was 12 years old. It's something I picked at school and after I met Rodica through friends on a trip to New York, I taught her how to snowboard.

'I even bought Rodica all of her snowboarding equipment for her 22nd birthday.

'On the day we got married there was no snowboarding theme, but I had the idea to go to the local ski hill and take some pictures snowboarding for a "trash the dress" style photoshoot since it was something we both enjoyed doing.

'Trash the dress' is a style of wedding photography where newlyweds ruin their elegant clothing in an unusual and often messy environment.

The pair, originally of Suceava, Romania, met when Adrian visited New York and he taught Rodica the sport

As well as showing off their snowboarding skills the pair also incorporated tender moments into the shoot

Adrian says: 'The shoot wasn't very hard to plan, we just had to make sure the ski hill would stay open.

'We took our snowboarding wedding pictures on 25th March and the slopes had closed two days earlier, but they were nice enough to provide an all-terrain vehicle and drivers to take us up.'

A day after getting married at a Romanian Pentecostal Church, Adrian and Rodica, originally from Suceava, Romania, drove to the town of Holly in Michigan to create their adventurous photoshoot, which lasted two hours. 

The couple say many people ask how they were able to get so much fake snow into a photo studio 

Forgoing the traditional horse and carriage or limousine, the pair arrived for their shoot on a snow plough

The pair are clearly delighted with their unconventional wedding photographs 

And forgoing the traditional horse and carriage or limousine, the couple arrived for their shoot on a snow plough.

Adrian says: 'All the equipment that I regularly snowboard with is what was used in the photoshoot, and we were lucky that the dress wasn't completely ruined and still hangs in our wardrobe.

'The first question that everyone asks when they look through our wedding album is how were we able to get so much fake snow in a studio.

'They are shocked when we tell them this is all real snow and we were actually on a hillside.'
