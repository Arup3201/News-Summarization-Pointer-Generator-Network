A police dog ate a hamster during a raid on the pet's owner's home.

Officers from Greater Manchester police were raiding the home of a man who has since been prosecuted by the RSPCA.

Musa Khan, 46, had his home in Oldham searched by officers last May.

The hamster escaped when their police dog knocked its cage over, setting in free, according to Manchester Evening News.

The dog ate the hamster and despite being forced to cough it up, the animal had died.

No charges were brought against Mr Khan in connection to the raid.

However, police found a parakeet in the house that was missing a lot of feathers.

Khan was prosecuted by the RSPCA and pleaded guilty to failing to prevent suffering at Oldham magistrates' court.

The hamster was owned by Musa Kham, who has been prosecuted by the RSPCA for failing to care for a parakeet whose feather had fallen out

Defence lawyer Tim Hughes said Khan had kept animals for many years safely.

He said: 'He accepts keeping the bird in a cage that's close to a radiator and TV in a room where an old cat has been.'

Mark Harper, prosecuting, said: 'The bird was in poor bodily condition and had lost feathers.

'It could have been avoided with a regular cleaning regime.'

Mr Khan was banned from keeping a bird for two years.

He was fined £110 and ordered to pay £400 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.
