Speaking out: Robert Peston has written a powerful article to admit that pupils 'knew it went on'

Robert Peston revealed last night he is haunted by the  sexual abuse that went on at his former school.

The BBC’s economics editor believes the ‘hideous predilection’ of at least one teacher was regarded as an ‘eccentricity to be tolerated’ in the liberal 1970s.

‘Goodness knows how many other paedophiles were for years able to get away with it in schools like mine,’ he wrote in a newspaper article.

Mr Peston admitted that his ‘fond memories’ of his state school had been replaced by anxieties as a parent about ‘the vulnerability of our children even in institutions that seem caring and healthy’.

Having previously seen his school as a ‘haven and refuge from the badness in the world’, Mr Peston was forced to reappraise his feelings after a former pupil wrote to him to reveal he had been sexually abused there.

Mr Peston attended Highgate Wood comprehensive in north London in the 1970s.

Former assistant headteacher Andrew Adams, now 68, who was a games teacher when Mr Peston was there and even had a wing named after him, was jailed for 12 years in July after admitting multiple serious sexual offences.

Mr Peston – a champion of state education – was not aware of the crimes until the victim, a former student in the 1980s, contacted him a few weeks ago.

In a powerful article for The Times, he wrote: ‘I was never close to Adams because I was a swot and not a jock, although I remember him as a bit of a bully.’

He continued: ‘When the victim sent me the charge sheet and his witness statement, it became clear that Adams was a paedophile.’

However, Mr Peston revealed in the article he did recall another teacher at the school who asked boys to urinate into a cup in front of him.

He wrote: ‘This teacher had a cupboard at the back of his classroom, into which he would invite certain boys to make him his “special orange juice”. They peed into a cup in front of him.

‘Everybody in my year and adjacent years knew it was happening. The more confident, savvier kids, like me, steered clear. But for reasons that I don’t fully understand today, I never told my parents or any teacher about any of this.’

He added: ‘All of this has haunted me in a relatively low level way for a long time.’

Revelations: The former assistant head teacher at Highgate Wood School in Haringey is now serving a 12-year prison sentence for his crimes in the 1970s. At the time, it was regarded as 'eccentricity to be tolerated'

He added: ‘What I now think is that the Highgate Wood of the  liberal 1970s regarded the teacher’s hideous predilection for seeing boys p*** as an eccentricity to be tolerated.’

The journalist said he previously asked a former Haringey councillor, now dead, if she was aware of the claims and was told that the teacher was quietly removed from the school after an incident came to the council’s attention.

Mr Peston said his fond memories of his former school spurred him to set up a charity, Speakers for Schools, which provides talks for children from inspirational people.

He said: ‘This re-examination has not led me to conclude that Highgate Wood was a poor school, but it has made me anxious, as a parent, about the vulnerability of our  children even in institutions that seem caring and healthy.’

Mr Peston added that when he asked whether Haringey Council had any records of the teacher being moved, he was told if he had concerns of further criminality, they should be referred to the police.

No one at Haringey Council was available for comment last night.
