Public support for staying in the European Union has surged, according to a new poll.

More than half the public now say they would vote to stay in the union - while the proportion of voters certain to support Ukip at the next election has slumped to just four per cent.

Support for leaving the EU, meanwhile, has fallen to just 37 per cent, the Ipsos Mori survey found.

Just a year after David Cameron promised an in-out referendum on the EU, support for Brussels has surged. More than half the public now back staying in the union - compared to just 37 per cent who want to get out

It marks a dramatic shift in public support for Brussels since David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum last year.

In November 2012, 44 per cent said they would vote to stay in the EU - with 48 per cent saying they would vote to get out.

The growing support for Brussels comes despite polls predicting Nigel Farage is on course to win next week's European elections, ahead of both Labour and the Conservatives.

But, according to today's poll, Ukip's may struggle to carry their momentum into next year’s general election.

The survey found the proportion of voters certain to vote Ukip drops from nine per cent in next week's European elections to just four per cent at the general election.

More than half the public think a vote for Ukip in May next year will be a wasted vote.

In contrast, Labour, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems are all likely to do better in the general election that in next week's european poll, Ipsos Mori's survey suggests.

A chunk of voters who claim they are certain not to vote Conservative or Labour at the European elections would consider backing the two main parties in next year's Westminster contest.

Some 57 per cent of voters said they would definitely not vote Tory next week - but only 46 per cent ruled out backing David Cameron in the general election.

For Labour, just over half have ruled out backing the party next week - but this drops to 43 per cent for next year's Parliamentary election.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who insisted his controversial poster campaign against EU migration was not racist, has predicted that his party will win next week's European elections. But today's poll suggests he will struggle to turn seats in Brussels to victories in Westminster

There is also a strong indication that Mr Cameron's pledge to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU carries broad support.

Just three in ten Brits are happy to see the country's relationship with Europe 'remaining broadly the same as at present’, which Nick Clegg suggested would be the case during his TV debates with Mr Farage.

The same proportion want the relationship 'returning to being part of an economic community, without political links’.

One in five would like to see ‘Britain leaving the European Union altogether’,

But moves towards ‘closer political and economic integration’ with the EU is the least favoured option - with just 13 per cent support.

Voters are also the least likely to describe themselves as Ukip.

Since David Cameron promised an in-out referendum on the EU, support for leaving has plummeted, according to today's poll

When asked ‘Generally speaking, do you think of yourself as Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, UKP, or what?’ just 5 per cent said they thought of themselves as Ukip.

This is despite the fact that the party is currently supported by up to 15 per cent of Brits according to polls.

Just under a third of the public see themselves as Labour - while a quarter consider themselves ‘Conservative’. Just nine per cent say they are ‘Lib Dem’.

Despite this, half of the public agree that the party is highlighting important issues which other parties aren’t taking seriously enough - including 52 per cent of Tory supporters and 44 per cent of Labour voters. Only a third disagree.

Opinion is more evenly split as to whether Ukip is out of touch with the modern world -  43 per cent saying they are a party out of touch with the modern world and 40 per cent disagreeing.

Gideon Skinner, Head of Political Research at Ipsos MORI, said: 'The rise of UKIP is one of the key political events over the last few years, even though many people still don’t see themselves casting a vote for UKIP, especially once the European elections are over.

'But the party is pushing some of the right buttons for the public - even among those who are planning on voting Labour or Conservative.

'Meanwhile, on the issues of the election, after several years of hostility to Europe after the crash, people seem more willing to stay in the EU – though a reduction in its powers is still more popular than further integration.'
