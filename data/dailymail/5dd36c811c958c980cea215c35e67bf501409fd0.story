At least 28 bodies 
have been recovered from a mass grave in Veracruz, an eastern Mexican 
state plagued by attacks on migrants and drug cartel violence, officials
 said Wednesday.

The state government said 
officials found the grave on a ranch outside the town of Tres Valles.

It
 said investigators were still excavating the grave, but did not release
 any more details.

The bodies were found at Diamante ranch by members of an army patrol at an abandoned ranch in Veracruz --a stronghold of the Zetas, one of Mexico's most bloodthirsty cartels

A local newspaper reported that marines found the 
bodies after spotting vultures on a dirt road.

The
 area was being guarded by federal and state police forces, while people
 with missing relatives or friends began arriving at the offices of 
state authorities in Tres Valles to see if their loved ones were among 
the victims.

Investigators were looking for more bodies on the ranch, 
which is known as El Diamante.

On Monday, 
authorities found seven bodies in a grave in the nearby town of 
Cosamaloapan. Authorities said the victims were all members of one 
family from Tres Valles.

The Gulf Coast state 
of Veracruz has suffered years of fighting between the Zetas drug cartel
 and its rivals.

It is also crossed by tens of thousands of Central 
Americans migrants heading toward the U.S. each year.

Officials
 have discovered a series of mass graves around Mexico in recent years, 
several filled with the bodies of migrants slain by the gangs that 
control profitable migrant-smuggling routes.

One
 of the largest single mass graves found in Mexico in recent years was 
discovered in 2010 in Tamaulipas state.

It contained the bodies of 72 
migrants, whom authorities said were slain by members of the Zetas angry
 that the victims declined to work for the cartel.
