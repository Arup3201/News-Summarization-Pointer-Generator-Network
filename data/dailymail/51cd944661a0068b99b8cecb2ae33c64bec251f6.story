A police spokesperson told Reuters they were investigating the death as 'unnatural.' 

He declined to give details, but the term 'unnatural death' in Singapore often refers to falls or other accidents.

The family was last seen together in Sydney back in January for Dr Kidman and his wife, Janelle's 50th wedding anniversary. 

In June this year, a beaming Nicole Kidman, 46 walked the red carpet with her father and husband Keith Urban at the Swisse Celebrate Life Ball in Melbourne. 

In one of his last public statements, Dr Kidman wrote of the pointless pursuit of happiness.

In the article titled 'Forget happiness, search for meaning', Dr Kidman wrote about the importance of striving for achievable goals in life, with a focus on being contented with what you have rather than on a life of material wealth.

Nicole Kidman was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1967, while her parents were studying abroad.

The family moved to Sydney's North Shore when the actress was four.

Nicole Kidman has previously been quoted describing her father as a 'great' man that she could rely on at any time of the day.

'He's a great father, I can call him at three in the morning and he's there for me,' she said.

'By the time I was a teenager, I had developed skills as a writer, and my father encouraged me to think about a career in journalism.'

'I began keeping a diary, which I maintain to this day. I used to fill whole notebooks with my writings.'

'My parents thought it was nice to develop my imagination, but they never seriously thought that anything would ever come of it.'

She said her family once told her that she couldn't become an actress because of her height.

'They said that I couldn't be an actress because I would be taller than all my leading men, so I thought I would be a writer instead.'

But despite this she said her parents have always been supportive of her career in acting.

'They allowed me any artistic outlet I wanted.'

'Each weekend I'd go to the theatre at Phillip Street. I used to just lock myself in there for the whole weekend. I thought it was fantastic. I'd be teased a lot though, because I'd be going off to the theatre instead of going to the beach with the boys and all the girls. I felt like an outsider because of that.'
