She's the young mother who went from working the checkout at Woolworths to putting her life on the line as a machine gun wielding bodyguard in the Middle East.

Neryl Joyce, 41, exposed herself to threats of ambush and assassinations as a highly trained security guard protecting high threat targets in war-torn Baghdad a decade ago.

The former Australian Army officer made the move to Iraq after juggling single motherhood and her military career for several years.

'I knew I couldn't do both, it was too draining,' Ms Joyce told Daily Mail Australia.

'I got my ex-husband involved and we decided our son Kane would live with him while I was over there and when I returned on leave I would have made enough money to be a stay-at-home mum.'

Ms Joyce, who carried out four different rotations in Iraq from 2004 to 2006, said she prepared for the worst when it came time to say goodbye to a then five-year-old Kane.

'I never thought I wouldn't come back, but I still prepared just in case,' she said.

'I wrote two letters – one for his father to read to him in case I was killed but was too young to read it and another for when he was 18.'

Ms Joyce quit her job in the Australian Army and took up a position as the only female bodyguard for a security company in Baghdad.

'My whole adult life I'd trained to work in a war zone, but I couldn't do it as a female officer in the army at the time,' she said. 

'All my soldiers were being deployed to Iraq for bodyguard type work but I couldn't go because of my rank and gender. After watching for a year, I really started to get jealous.'

Ms Joyce, who has detailed her transition from motherhood to Baghdad bodyguard in a memoir title Mercenary Mum, said she had several close calls in the war torn country.

'We had an improvised explosive device go off in a vehicle we were driving next to... but there were lots of hairy moments.

Initially Ms Joyce's job was to protect the electoral commissioners in Iraq's first democratic elections

On her last rotation in Iraq, Ms Joyce met her husband-to-be Paul. They now live together in Perth

'We once had a vehicle with six people wearing balaclavas and weapons drive past. We thought that was it, we thought they were insurgents. People would just fill their cars with bombs and look for targets... then you'd have a suicide bombing just like that.'

She spent two years, on and off, looking after high target clients in their workplace. They would pick up the client, escort them to work, walk them to lunch and meetings - all the while avoiding ambush attacks and assassinations.

Ms Joyce said her experiences were different each time she went back to Iraq.

'The first time was very exciting and confidence boosting. It was a really great feeling,' she said. 

But she said the next rotation started to turn sour when she noticed slipping security standards and poor leadership with the company. 

Ms Joyce said her experiences were ranged from positive to negative each of the four times she went back to Iraq

Her colleagues were ambushed and killed on the last day of her second rotation on one of the world's most dangerous roads.

'I was supposed to be with them, but it was just a fluke that a spilt boiling water on me and had to get treatment.'

Ms Joyce was also raped by a colleague on another rotation after he spiked her drink. 

'But despite all that, on my last rotation I met my now husband, Paul. So I call that my lucky rotation,' she said. 

The mother-of-one said being a woman wasn't particularly an issue in the security sector, despite not being allowed into combat in the army.

'It was a little bit of a novelty for men at first. But once I proved I had the skills to back it up, it wasn't a problem.' 

Ms Joyce and her husband finished up in Iraq in 2006 and both took up positions managing Christmas Island Detention Centre.

'Now I'm exploring a bit of everything. Being a mother, writing a book, working on a tactical clothing line etc.'
