Gus Poyet does not want to ‘suffer’ a season like last with Sunderland and says his players feel ‘unbeatable’ following their relegation escape.

The Black Cats won four of their last five games to scramble clear of the bottom three.

They were seven points adrift of safety in mid April and the suspicion was that Poyet would not have remained in charge in the Championship.

Not again! Gus Poyet does not want to 'suffer' another relegation scrap this season

But the Uruguayan masterminded their survival and – with Thursday’s £2.5million addition of Will Buckley from former club Brighton his seventh of the summer – he is looking forward to his first full campaign as a Premier League manager.

‘We talk a lot about momentum and there are a few players, the players who were there at the end of the season, who finished playing with the feeling of being unbeatable practically,’ said the Sunderland boss ahead of tomorrow’s trip to West Brom.

‘I hope that we take it into this season because it is very, very important that we start well in the Premier League.

‘If you do not, what happened to us last season can happen and I do not want to suffer again.’

Arrivals lounge: Sunderland have signed winger Will Buckley for £2.5m from Brighton

Buckley, meanwhile, has penned a three-year deal at the Stadium of Light and will go straight into the squad which travels to the Hawthorns.

The 24-year-old is reunited with Poyet on Wearside having become Brighton’s £1m record signing when he joined from Watford in 2011.

Buckley’s arrival follows last week’s £10m signing of Manchester City midfielder Jack Rodwell.

He is likely to partner another former Brighton player, Liam Bridcutt, in midfield against the Baggies.

And Bridcutt says Rodwell has already impressed his new team-mates.

‘For such a young player Jack has had quite a lot of Premier League experience,’ he said.

Back on track: Jack Rodwell (2L) has impressed in training since his £10m move from Manchester City

‘It was tough for him to get an opportunity (at Manchester City) so he is coming here hungry and ready to go.

‘He has shown that hunger in the training sessions he has been involved in and he is a good player to have around.’
