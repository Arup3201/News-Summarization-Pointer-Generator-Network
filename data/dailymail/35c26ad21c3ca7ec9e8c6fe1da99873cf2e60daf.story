Twitter should automatically block racist words, a Labour MP who was a victim of online anti-Semitism has said.

Luciana Berger, shadow minister for public health, said she received 2,500 hate messages at the height of an internet campaign against her.

She said the social media site 'let me down' and took a 'sporadic and haphazard' approach to removing offensive posts.

Miss Berger revealed the abuse had been orchestrated by white supremacists and neo-Nazis from the US and the UK.

She has since stepped up security at her houses in London and her Liverpool constituency.

In October, Garron Helm, from Litherland, north of Liverpool, was handed a four-week custodial sentence at Merseyside Magistrates Court for sending an anti-Semitic tweet to Miss Berger.

The 21-year-old Nazi sympathiser sent a 'grossly offensive' anti-Semitic tweet to Miss Berger showing a Holocaust-era yellow star superimposed on the MP's forehead with the hashtag 'Hitler was right'.

When police searched Helm's home they found Nazi memorabilia including a flag bearing the SS symbol and material from British extreme right-wing group National Action.

Helm referred to himself online as The Noble Wolf and used a Twitter account called Aethelwulf, which translates from Old English as Noble Wolf.

But in reality Helm was an immature loner who found friends online in extremist groups.

In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Miss Berger called on the social networking site to do more to stop abuse.

The MP for Liverpool Wavertree said: 'At the height of the abuse, the police said I was the subject of 2,500 hate messages in the space of three days using the hashtag 'filthyjewbitch'.

'Online hate needs to be taken as seriously as offline hate - but it isn't. Twitter's response isn't good enough. It has a responsibility to do more to protect its users.

'The site is letting me and many others down who have been the subject of lots of hate. It could start by automatically banning racist words which aren't allowed to be printed in newspapers or broadcast on TV that could never be used in a positive way - such as kike (a derogatory term for a Jewish person).'

Miss Berger contacted Twitter's UK head of Public Policy, Nick Pickles, direct in an attempt to have her abuser's accounts suspended.

She added: 'Twitter let me down. It took well over a week for some of the abusive content to be removed and even when it was, the approach was sporadic and very haphazard,' Miss Berger told The Telegraph.

'Twitter has made some improvements on the site and it's important that you can report people – but when you are getting the level of abuse I was, it's an onerous task reporting each and every person.'

Miss Berger said she had been forced to increase security at her home, including fitting a 'bomb bag at the back of my post boxes'.

She has also had a new alarm system and CCTV fitted and shatterproof film applied to windows. 

A spokesman for Twitter told the paper the firm was 'working hard' to combat abuse but blocking individual words was 'generally ineffective at stopping unwanted behaviour'.
