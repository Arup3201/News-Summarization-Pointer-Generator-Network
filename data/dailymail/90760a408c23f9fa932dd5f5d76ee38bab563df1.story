Waiting in long checkout queues after discovering your favourite items are sold out while dodging screaming kids and trolleys blocking the aisles is most customers' idea of the supermarket trip from hell.

A national survey reveals that most people can’t get in and out of supermarkets quick enough as being stuck in never-ending checkout queues has come in as the number one pet peeve for 62 per cent of Australians.

More than half of the 2,500 consumers loathed discovering the items they wanted were out of stock and also showed their loyalty to labels with 35 per cent not impressed when their desired brands are replaced by the supermarket’s line.

While parents who have no control over their unruly children and self service machine errors equally irritated 38 per cent of shoppers and trolleys blocking the aisles was almost as annoying for 36 per cent.

Parents who have no control over their unruly children was another massive bug bear for customers

Trolleys blocking the aisles was also annoying for 36 per cent of people surveyed

Another common obstacle when attempting a seamless shopping experience was navigating the car park to find a spot which was a killer for 28 per cent of respondents - while searching for the ever elusive staff member for assistance was also not so much fun for 28 per cent of customers.

But on the other hand, a talkative check assistant was a tad painful for 11 per cent of Australians.

The fact that alcohol wasn’t available in supermarkets was not a massive bug bear with only eight per cent of people finding it inconvenient.

However, eight per cent of people admitted to having stolen something from a supermarket such as walking out without paying or not scanning something at the self-checkout.

Canstar Blue conducted the survey and spokesman Simon Downes said the frustrations expressed by shoppers was perfectly understandable.

'A supermarket selling out of an item you want is probably going to annoy you even more if you’ve just struggled to find a parking space and then had to fight your way through a packed aisle full of screaming kids just to find out,' he said.

'If you’ve had a particularly frustrating experience doing your shopping, the last thing you need is 10 minutes queuing up time to dwell on it.'

Mr Downes said a swift shopping trip was important for time-poor customers.

'You might find that by the time you do get to pay, the last thing you want to do is engage in small talk with the person scanning your items,' he said.

'Or if you’ve decided to take the self-service option and keep being told to take unexpected items out of the bagging area, you’ll probably feel like you can’t get home quick enough.'

Meanwhile on a grassroots level, an overwhelming 74 per cent saw the importance of buying locally produced food.

As many as 68 per cent of the surveyors saw no problem with eating products a day or two past the used by date and 65 per cent believed their supermarket was the best value for money.

While 53 per cent declared their loyalty to their store despite 46 per cent believing they could get groceries cheaper elsewhere but preferred the convenience of the one they knew best.

The consumers proved they weren't major suckers for advertising with only 13 per cent admitting to being influenced by an ad on TV and deciding to swap supermarkets as a result, while as few as eight per cent care which supermarket a celebrity chef has signed with.
