A record £3.1 million ($5.7 million) in cash was seized last week in Sydney by Australian police, leading to the arrest of an American man, as a part of the latest bust in their crackdown on international money laundering and drug trafficking.

The millions were found spread across seven suitcases, with officers arresting an man from the U.S., 58, who had only been in the country two days.

The man, who denied that the money belonged to him, was charged with dealing with the suspected proceeds of crime, and could face 3 years in jail, or up to 25 years in jail if he is also charged with money laundering.

Australian police are calling this one of its largest ever cash finds, after cash was found stuffed into seven separate suitcases, but it by no means the end of the Australian operation, which has been going on for 12 months

So far, the crackdown, named Operation Eligo, has netted authorities more than £307 million ($580 million) in cash, drugs and assets since its inception.

The Australian Crime Commission (ACC) began the operation in an effort to crack down on major crime including money laundering, illegal drugs markets and organised crime.

It is a collaboration between the ACC, AUSTRAC (Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre), and federal and state police, who have been working for 12 months to target international criminals and money launderers.

It is thought there is a very complex network of criminals from 20 countries involved in moving illicit earnings from illegals activity in and out of Australia.

This network is believed to include terrorist organisations, human traffickers, biker gangs and drug cartels with £16 billion ($30 billion) going through Australia every year.

Almost $6 million in a suitcase, as well as several newspapers and a guidebook to Sydney. An American man has been arrested and charged with dealing with property that is thought to be the proceeds of crime

So far authorities from the ACC have siezed more than £13.7 million ($26 million) in cash and £281 million ($530 million) in drugs. There have also been 105 people arrested on 190 charges.

Australian Minister for Justice, Micheal Keenan, described the results as 'extraordinary'.

He said: 'Seizing more than $550 million worth of drugs and cash is a significant blow to the criminal economy.

'The international money transfer business is a legitimate industry, and one which is now better protected against serious and organised crime.'

The American is understood to have arrived two days before he was arrested last weekend

Chief executive of the ACC Paul Jevtovic said the operation is using 'criminal intelligence insights' like those used by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to disrupt links between drug cartels, money launderers and terrorist groups.

Mr Jevtovic said: 'Non-traditional law enforcement measures aimed at disrupting and deterring organised crime groups from targeting Australia have been used.

'Through these new methodologies, new areas of focus, and new and more efficient ways of investigation, we've been better able to unearth an elaborate network of criminal activity, and remove half a billion dollars from the criminal economy-profits destined to line the pockets of criminals.'

Australian Federal Police Commissioner Tony Negus said Operation Eligo was having a significant impact.

He said: 'These criminals are now firmly in our sight, and we will continue to target their activities to remove the incentive and reward for organised crime in this country.'

So far the operation has seen seen the arrests of 105 people on 190 charged and a $20 million seizure of drugs, cash and assets by West Australian Police last week

The bust was the biggest single seizure of crime-related cash in Australian history, and comes after a series of other record busts during the operation

Chief Executive Officer of AUSTRAC, John Schmidt, said the legitimate sector has a high risk of being exploited by serious and organised crime groups.

He said: 'The inherent risk of the sector - which provides an important service whereby Australians can send money anywhere in the world affordably and almost instantaneously - underlines the importance of maintaining a robust regulatory regime and continuing industry engagement and support.'

United States Ambassador to Australia John Berry said: 'I’m proud that we have such strong law enforcement cooperation with Australia.

Together we are disrupting the international drug trade and preventing people from profiting from crime.'

By using DEA tactics, with access to their global network, combining it with their own intelligence from Commonwealth agencies, Operation Eligo has also closed down three amphetamine labs, and one of the largest urban hydroponic grow houses ever seen in Port Botany, New South Wales.

Investigations are continuing.
