Fine: Chinese film director Zhang Yimou, is facing a £100 million lawsuit, after being accused of fathering seven children

One of China's most celebrated film directors has said he broke the country's strict one-child policy because of an ancient traditional belief that having multiple children would lead to greater prosperity.

Zhang Yimou, who directed hit movies House of Flying Daggers and Hero as well as the opening and closing ceremonies at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, is now facing a £100million fine after months of rumours that he fathered as many as seven children.

He has admitted having two sons and a daughter with his current wife and a daughter with his ex wife, in a statement.

Zhang, who faces an official penalty largely based on his and his wife's income in the years before each child was born, also claimed that one year he only earned $450.

In an interview with the official Xinhua news agency on Sunday, the director said he broke the law because his father told him before dying that he wanted a grandson to 'carry on the family name'.

He said: 'Traditionally my parents and I thought the more children one has, the more prosperous the family would be.'

The one-child policy was put in place to control China's booming population, and officials say it has been key to the country's rising prosperity.

But with demographic experts warning of a labour shortage within the next two decades, China's Communist Party leaders last month moved to expand the exceptions to the policy after a key meeting in Beijing, allowing couples to have two children if one of the parents is an only child.

Zhang has come under mounting criticism for taking advantage of his fame and wealth, but said his family had suffered because they had broken the rules, according to the report.

'We were hiding here and there as "extra-birth guerillas"', Zhang said, referring to a TV comedy in the 1990s about a couple who went on the run to have multiple babies.

'My fault has negatively affected my children's childhood significantly,' he added.

Controversial: China's one-child policy was put in place to 
control China's booming population, and officials say it has been key to
 the country's rising prosperity

Critics
 say China's late-1970s family-planning law, which restricts most 
couples to one child, is selectively and sometimes brutally enforced, 
while the wealthy and well-connected are easily able to pay the fines 
levied for extra offspring.

But some users of China's popular online social networks 
have directed their anger at the policy itself, rather than Zhang, with 
some hoping the attention heaped on his case may hasten the eventual 
demise of the law, which authorities have recently moved to relax.

The
 policy was put in place to control China's booming population, and 
officials say it has been key to the country's rising prosperity.

But
 opposition to it has steadily grown among members of the public as well
 as among demographic experts, who warn that it has led to a decline in 
China's working-age population and a swelling of the ranks of the 
elderly that could bring about a labour shortage within the next two 
decades.

Those fears appear to be shared by 
China's Communist Party leaders, who after a key meeting in Beijing last
 month moved to expand the exceptions to the policy to allow couples to 
have two children if one of the parents is an only child.

In the past Chinese web users have typically responded with fury to reports of celebrities escaping the one-child regulation, but sentiments over the past week have been more mixed, with some citing Zhang as an example of why the law should be scrapped.

'We should be grateful to Zhang Yimou!' one posted on Sina Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter. 'Thanks to his popularity, he's made the whole society debate the problems of the 'family planning policy'! This might help speed up the abolition of this draconian law.'

Another said the controversy was 'more than ridiculous', adding: 'Procreating is a fundamental human instinct and a way of passing things on to future generations. Here in China, it's actually become a crime.'

In 2012, 24 of the country's 31 provinces and regions collected a total of nearly 20 billion yuan in penalties, the Beijing News reported Thursday. None of the provincial authorities has detailed how the money was spent.
