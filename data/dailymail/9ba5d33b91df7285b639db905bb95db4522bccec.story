North West was clearly having the time of her life at dance class with her cousins Penelope and Mason on Thursday.

But, of course, the ballet and tap session in Woodland Hills, California had to come to a close at some point and the 21-month-old appeared to be, understandably, a bit upset.

However, the youngster looked like she got over it rather quickly while in the arms of her mother Kim Kardashian, who earlier that day debuted her newly dyed raven locks.

Not yet, mommy! North West looked a little upset to be leaving her ballet and tap session in Woodland Hills, California on Tuesday but soon got over it in the arms of her newly raven-haired mother Kim Kardashian

Kim caused a stir as she debuted her polarizing platinum-blonde locks at Paris Fashion week earlier this month.

But it seems the 34-year-old has grown tired of the damage and maintenance stemming from the new 'do as she returned to raven locks.

She was back to her signature look as she took North to dance class with Kourtney and her children Penelope and Mason.

 Similar style: Kourtney's children both sported navy blue and white striped shorts for Thursday's outing

Her long dark locks were styled straight, and she hid her eyes behind a pair of wayfarer-style sunglasses as she carried daughter Penelope into class.

Penelope and Mason both sported navy blue and white-striped shorts for the outing, with the young girl donning a studded tank top while Mason wore a graphic print T-shirt.

Kourtney opted to cover her slim new waistline with the T-shirt, after having recently shared an Instagram snap celebrating her return to 120lbs, commenting: 'First day that I have seen this number in a while.'

Kim, however, showed off another style transformation, having returned to black hair after a much-discussed platinum-blonde makeover.

She debuted the shocking new look on March 5, just in time for Paris Fashion Week, but immediately returned to the salon for a touch-up, posting on social media just four days later: 'It's hard out here for a platinum pimp! Thank you @FredericMennetrier for touching up my blonde!'

Then, last week, Mrs. Kanye West returned to dye her blonde locks yet again, posting: 'Being blonde is a full time job!'

Fraying: Kim likely returned to her signature color due to the stress constant bleaching was putting on her hair - she revealed dry, damaged locks while on a Malibu family outing on Sunday

Then, after bleaching her hair for the third time in three weeks, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was spotted sporting damaged locks while out with husband Kanye and daughter North.

Her blonde hair was pulled back into a hasty ponytail and strands had fallen out and blew listlessly in the ocean breeze on the Malibu family outing on Sunday.

Celebrity hairdresser Andrew Jose, ambassador for Salon Science, had warned that if she's not careful, Kim could suffer some serious breakage due to her blonde preference.

Later that day: Kim was spotted clocking in some gym time

Zip up: The star wore a figure hugging jacket

Andrew, who has styled the tresses of Alanis Morissette, Jamie Campbell Bower and Louise Redknapp, said: 'This type of bleach blonde look goes beyond fashion and if done well can look high-end and powerful.

'Be warned though, this look is definitely not for the faint-hearted. Not only does maintaining the regrowth take a lot of commitment but the chemical process of bleach on the hair can be incredibly damaging.' 

He added: 'Overuse and repeated application of bleach to the scalp can strip the hair of moisture and damage the follicle.

'This may cause the hair to either fall out from the root or to break at the weakest point along the hair shaft.' 

Cool customer: Kim was dressed in all black as she slicked her dark locks into a tight pony tail
