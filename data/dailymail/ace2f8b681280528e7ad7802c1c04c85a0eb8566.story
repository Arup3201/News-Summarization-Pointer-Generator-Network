Tractor beams evoke scenes from Star Trek and Star Wars, but scientists have swapped lasers for water to create a similar device.

Australian physicists have developed technology that works in liquids and involves manipulating currents with wave generators.

During tests, scientists used it to pull a ping pong ball towards the generator, as well as push it away. Experts hope that one day the technology will be used to control oil spills, or even fleets of ships.

Physicists at the Australian National University have created a tractor beam on water that controls flow patterns using wave generators (pictured). This means the researchers can move objects at will, without touching them. The 'beam' could be used to control oil spills, for example

Last year, a team from the University of St Andrews and the Institute of Scientific Instruments (ISI) in the Czech Republic built a laser capable of moving tiny spheres of polystyrene floating in water. 

The team fired a laser through a lens, which then went to a mirror that bounced the beam back.

The reflected beam interfered with the incoming beam.

Meanwhile, the scientists suspended polystyrene spheres in water directly in the path of the laser beams.

The beams held the spheres in place vertically, and any pulling or pushing force moved the spheres to the left or to the right. 

Changing the way the light is polarised changes the direction the spheres move. 

The work could also reveal new insights into how waves on beaches occur.

The technology was created by Professor Michael Shats and Dr Horst Punzmann from Australian National University's Research School of Physics and Engineering.

‘We have figured out a way of creating waves that can force a floating object to move against the direction of the wave,’ said Dr Punzmann.

‘No one could have guessed this result,’ he said.

Using a ping pong ball in a wave tank, the researchers used the size and frequency of the waves, when viewed through a slow-motion camera, to work out their different size and frequency. 

They were then able to manipulate these waves to move the ball in whichever direction they wanted.

Advanced particle tracking tools, developed by team members Dr Nicolas Francois and Dr Hua Xia, revealed that the waves generate currents on the surface of the water.

‘We found that above a certain height, these complex three-dimensional waves generate flow patterns on the surface of the water,’ Professor Shats said.

‘The tractor beam is just one of the patterns, they can be inward flows, outward flows or vortices.’

‘It’s one of the great unresolved problems, yet anyone in the bathtub can reproduce it. We were very surprised no-one had described it before.’

The team also experimented with different shaped plungers to generate different swirling flow patterns.

‘This work on the tractor beam began shortly after we realised the particle motion on the surface, as determined by waves, is by far too complex to handle with any existing mathematical theory,’ said Dr Punzmann.

Previous research into 'tractor beams' have concentrated on moving objects using lasers, as seen in science fiction films and TV shows. The Starship Enterprise from Star Trek (pictured) is shown using its tractor beam on a smaller spaceship
