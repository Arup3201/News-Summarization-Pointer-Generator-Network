At the age of 51 Tina Malone shows no signs of settling down into her older age.

Last year, at the age of 50, the Shameless actress gave birth to her second child and now she has revealed plans to change her life further by spending £50,000 on cosmetic surgery. 

The Liverpudlian actress says she has never been a looker despite having been born into an attractive family.

Tina Malone has revealed plans to spend £50,000 on cosmetic surgery in order to turn back her body clock

Tina is embarking on six months worth of procedures in just a few weeks time.

She plans to have her eyes, chin, neck, breasts, underarms and belly nipped and tucked  

Tina is not shy of cosmetic surgery and four years ago had a gastric band fitted losing 11st 4lbs and slimming down to a slender size 8 and weighing just 8st. 

The Shameless actress lost 11st after having a gastric band fitted but has been left with lots of excess skin that she hopes the surgery will rectify 

Tina says that she has always struggled with her looks, here she is pictured before her weight loss as Mimi in Channel 4's Shamelss

It was this sudden weight loss that has caused Tina to go in for further surgery to get rid of the excess skin she was left with.

'They reckon I've got around 10lb of skin to get rid of. Then I won't feel like I'm walking around with two bags of sugar in my knickers!'

Tina put off further surgery because she wanted to have IVF to fulfill her dream of having a baby daughter, Flame, who is now 10 months old.

Tina gained a little extra weight when she was carrying Flame but has since lost the weight and now wants to make sure she looks her very best. 

'I had the band loosened to feed the baby and I went up to 13st 7lb when I was pregnant with her,' says Tina.

At the age of 51 Tina has completely changed her life with both her dramatic weight loss and the birth of her second child, Flame just last year

'In March I had the band tightened and I am now 9st 11lbs and a size 10. I will be a size 8 again but I want to get rid of the excess skin which, however hard I work out, I am never going to get rid of.

'I won't look like Cheryl Cole but I want to see what I look like without it.'

Tina says she is extremely excited about completing her body transformation as she says that she has always battled with her appearance. 

'I'm not saying I was smacked with the ugly stick, but I certainly hit a few branches when I fell out of the tree,' she joked.

'I've never been a beauty. I never will be but, for the first time in my life, I want to make the best of myself and I'm really excited about that.'  

Tina's surgery will be filmed as part of a documentary series she is currently shooting looking at weight and obesity, due to be screened next summer.

Tina says that she would love to go on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here! 

The actress wants to lead by example and help others who have struggled with their weight. 

'People will say they are fat and happy but I will tell you they're not,' she says. 'I've been the fat bird with the diabetes and the breathlessness, and it's no fun.

'I will be talking to a woman in Australia who was 30st; young girls in Nigeria who are sent to fat camps to put weight on to make them more attractive to tribal chiefs and a 33st lap dancer in Las Vegas. I don't believe she thinks she is attractive, it's a disguise, a mask.'

She hasn't ruled out more reality telly, however. With Big Brother, Splash and Who's Doing The Dishes under her belt the actress wants to see how she would do in the Jungle with hopes to appear on I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here!

'I would probably cause murder,' she says.

'If I got ostracised or bullied because I wouldn't do a trial, I wouldn't care. So what if they only got beans and rice for tea, I'd tell them: "I'm here for the money".'

Right now Tina says she couldn't be happier and says that she has never been more satisfied in her own skin. 

'People say I look amazing for 51, and I love being 51. I feel 31. In my head, I'm 21.

'This is not clutching at youth. I am comfortable with me – but I will be more comfortable when I have had the work done.'
