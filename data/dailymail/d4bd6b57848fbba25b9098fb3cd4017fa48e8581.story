A lazy eagle grabbed a rare opportunity to rest its wings while 500ft in the air with both feet when it hitched a lift with a passing hang glider.

The bird of prey plonked itself on top of the flying machine as it glided high above the coastal town of Stanwell Park, just south of Sydney, Australia.

The uninvited passenger showed little fear and plenty of opportunism to spot the contraption with its eagle-eyes and piggy-back on the top.

Professional hang glider Tony Armstrong, who has been an instructor for 27 years, said he has never seen anything like it before.

The former rugby league player told The Australian: 'Over the years I have had many encounters with white-breasted sea eagles.

'However, this was the closest that I have seen it come to the hang glider.

'No sea eagle has ever caused any problems for me. They appear to be a very passive bird.

'I have names for the particular birds and Iâ€™ve named this guy Mr Young Dude.'

Harassed: The eagle was flapping around Tony Armstrong and his passenger for around 10 minutes

Mr Young Dude is an immature white-bellied sea eagle, who at one point got within three feet of the hang glider's wing.

The bird had harassed Mr Armstrong and his passenger for more than 10 minutes before turning its attention to fellow instructor Chris Clements for five minutes.

The instructors work for HangGlideOz and were being watched from the ground by the company's Ausilia Christinao.

She said: 'I watched the entire incident unfold. He [the eagle] was relentless.'
