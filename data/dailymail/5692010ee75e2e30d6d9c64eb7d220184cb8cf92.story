Hollywood film producer Scott Rudin has apologized for comments he made in some of the many emails he wrote that have been leaked over the past few days as a result of the Sony hack.

'Private emails between friends and colleagues written in haste and without much thought or sensitivity, even when the content of them is meant to be in jest, can result in offense where none was intended,' said Rudin.

'I made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny, but in the cold light of day, they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive — and not funny at all. To anybody I’ve offended, I’m profoundly and deeply sorry, and I regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused.'

My bad: Scott Rudein (above) has apologized for comments he made in leaked emails about President Barack Obama and Angelina Jolie

More emails: An email exchange between Amy Pascal (left) and Rudin (right) showed the two mocking the President's race

Bad timing: The emails were exchanged on the eve of a fundraiser attended by President Obama (above) at the home of DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg

The statement, released to Deadline, comes shortly after the most damning batch of emails were released, in which Rudin and Sony Pictures Chair Amy Pascal exchanged racist comments about President Barack Obama. 

Pascal also issued an apology on Thursday, saying; 'The content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am.'

She then added, 'although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.'  

On the eve of a fundraising breakfast being attended by the President at the home of DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, Pascal and Rudin went over things she could discuss with Obama while at the event in October 2013.

'Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?' Pascal asks Rudin, a reference to the 2012 Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained that dealt with the subject of slavery in the antebellum South.

'12 years,' responds Rudin, referencing another slavery film, this time Steve McQueen's 2013 Academy Award-winning work 12 Years a Slave, a very violent and brutal look at the injustice and abuse endured by the millions forced into slavery in America. 

The pair then keep going, listing as many current films starring black actors as they can name, including Lee Daniels' The Butler and two Kevin Hart movies, Think Like a Man and Ride Along.

'I bet he likes Kevin Hart,' says Rudin at one point.

Not good: The email exchange also finds Rudin commenting that President Obama 'likes Kevin Hart'

This all come just one day after Rudin called Angelina Jolie 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in emails discussing who would direct her upcoming remake of the classic film flop Cleopatra. 

Jolie had wanted the director David Fincher to helm the project, while Rudin wanted to use him on a Steve Jobs biopic he was developing.

In the end, Fincher passed on both.  

Rudin previously gave a statement to the New York Times about the hack earlier this week.

'This is not about salacious emails being batted around by Gawker and Defamer,' the disgraced producer said on Wednesday.

'It’s about a criminal act, and the people behind it should be treated as nothing more nor less than criminals.'

In other leaked emails, these having to do with the Jobs biopic, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has some not so kind words for the man now set to star in the film, Michael Fassbender.

'I don't know who Michael Fassbender is and the rest of the world isn't going to care,' Sorkin tells Pascal when informed of the studio's desire to cast the actor, who also starred in 12 Years a Slave. 

One man who is clearly a fan of Fassbender however is producer Michael De Luca, who says of the Irish actor in one email, 'He just makes you feel bad to have normal-sized genitalia.'  

The emails formed part of the November 24 cyber attack on Sony Pictures.

As for the fundraising event, which took place last November, President Obama did indeed talk about the film industry, saying: 'Believe it or not, entertainment is part of our American diplomacy. 

'If they’re watching an old movie — Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,The Mary Tyler Moore Show, or Will and Grace and Modern Family — they’ve had a front-row seat to our march towards progress. Even if their own nations haven’t made that progress yet.'

According to public records, Pascal donated $5,000 to President Obama's re-election campaign and gave a further $30,800 to the Democtratic National Committee. 

Obama made no mention of the films Django Unchained, 12 Years a Slave, Lee Daniels' The Butler, Think Like a Man or Ride Along in his speech at the event. 

Response: Hart posted his response to the emails on Instagram Thursday

Also on Thursday, Kevin Hart took to his Instagram to respond to an email conversation between Pascal and Clint Culpepper in which he was called a 'greedy whore' for demanding more money to promote on of his films on social media. 

'Knowing your self worth is extremely important people,' wrote Hart.'I worked very hard to get where I am today. I look at myself as a brand and because of that I will never allow myself to be taking advantage of. I OWN MY BRAND…I MAKE SMART DECISIONS FOR MY BRAND….I PROTECT MY BRAND….which is why I’m able to brush ignorance off of my shoulder and continue to move forward.'
