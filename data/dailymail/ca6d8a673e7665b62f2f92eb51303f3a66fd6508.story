Smell-o-vision has been a staple of bad sci-fi for decades, but could finally be edging closer to the average living room thanks to a super-accurate Japanese system.

A team from Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology in Japan have invented a 'smelling screen' that makes smells waft from the spot on a display that their corresponding objects appear.

The development promises to make adverts for fried chicken or fresh coffee even more appealing - or alternatively add an as yet undreamed of realism to documentary programmes like Life of Grime.

Smell-o-vision is nothing new, having been on the entertainment technology radar for over five decades.

The idea made its first widespread appearance with the 1960 film Scent Of Mystery (also known, less puntastically, as Holiday In Spain), which timed odours to specific points in the narrative.

The film opened in three specially equipped theatres in in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

Unfortunately, the mechanism did not work properly and audience members complained of a hissing noise accompanying the scents - as well as a delay between the actions and their corresponding smells.

As a result the film failed miserably, even after the mechanism was fixed.

But perhaps it was just an idea whose time had not yet arrived - for the latest Japanese technology seems to promise a new frontier in smell-related multimedia entertainment.

The invention is 'a new olfactory display that can generate a localised odour distribution on a two-dimensional display screen,' the researchers say.

'The generated odour distribution is as if an odour source had been placed on the screen, and leads the user to perceive the odour as emanating from a specific region of the screen.'

Smell the secret recipe: The system could bring a whole new dimension to, for example, KFC adverts

It works, New Scientist explains, by feeding odours from gel pellets into four air streams situated in each corner of the screen which are blown across the displays surface.

Varying the strength and direction of the air-streams using fans moves the scent to any particular spot on the screen, giving the illusion that it is emanating from the digital object displayed.

'The user can freely move his/her head to sniff at various locations on the screen, and can experience realistic changes in the odour intensity with respect to the sniffing location,' the researchers added in a statement.

At the moment the system can only make one smell at a time, but the researchers say the next stage is to include a cartridge like those used in printers to allow the smells to be changed more easily.

The technology was recently demonstrated the research at the IEEE Virtual Reality Conference in Orlando, Florida.

Haruka Matsukura, who led the team that invented the 'smelling screen' suggested that it could be used to enhance advertising hoardings and museum exhibits.
