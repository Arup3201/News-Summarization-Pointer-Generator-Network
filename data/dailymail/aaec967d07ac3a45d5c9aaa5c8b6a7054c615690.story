It is time for T.V. fanatics to take some much-needed inspiration from the athletes who won Great Britain bronze in the Games this year after it was revealed that the average reveller piled on a staggering 4.2lbs in the two weeks of the Olympics.

Ans as the BBC drew in record viewers for the Games, the capital shunned exercise regimes and instead indulged in the fun of the Olympics with extra snacks and alcohol in front of the T.V. leading to a whopping 18.9m stone weight gain across the UK.

And Londeners were the biggest snacking offenders with an average weight gain of 5.2 lbs.

Gorging: Britons snacked on treats as they watched the Olympic Games, resulting in a staggering 4.5lb average pile on

The survey highlighted that people living in the Capital
consumed nearly 700 calories more each day, as they treated themselves 
to a few glasses of wine and extra snacks on top of their regular meals.

This equated to 12,000 extra calories being consumed by the average Londoner during the Olympics – that’s more than 960m calories over the two-week period.

Mandy Cassidy, Director of Psychology at LighterLife, who conducted the study, said: 'The Olympics are a fantastic sporting occasion for Great Britain and we typically justify over-eating and associate over indulgence with celebratory occasions.

'Mindless eating occurs often in front of the TV and emotional eating is a well know reason for over eating when not hungry.

'Let’s hope Londoners are inspired by the sporting triumphs and introduce a regular exercise regime into their day!'

Two glasses of wine/beer (240 calories)

Bag of crisps (152 calories)

Dips- 2 tbsp of hummus (160 calories)

Two plain hobnobs with tea (134 calories)

TOTAL: 686 calories
