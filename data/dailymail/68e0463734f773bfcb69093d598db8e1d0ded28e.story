A fire has broken out among the wreckage of a collapsed garment factory in Bangladesh, bringing the search for survivors to a partial halt.

The blaze comes after rescuers found nine people alive inside the rubble of the multi-storey building, which collapsed five days ago killing hundreds of people.

Owner Mohammed Sohel Rana was also found and arrested today on the border with West Bengal.

Partial halt: A rescue worker is given oxygen as he is evacuated from the fire at the collapsed building

Tragedy: Rescuers carrying out a dead body from the rubble this evening, almost 92 hours after the collapse

Ongoing: Efforts to pull survivors from the building continue in Savar tonight despite the fire

Firefighting: Smoke can be seen rising from the rubble after flames were sparked by cutting equipment

The fire broke out this evening as 
rescuers 
tried to free a trapped woman. Officials believe the fire is likely to have killed her.

Sparks were generated as they attempted 
to cut through a steel rod to reach her, said a volunteer rescuer, Syed 
Al-Amin Roman.

He added that at least three rescue 
workers have been injured by the flames, with rescuers being forced to
retreat from part of the wreckage where the fire erupted.

But efforts to reach any possible 
survivors in others parts of the destroyed building are continuing as 
firefighters frantically hose down the flames.

Brig. Gen. Mohammed Siddiqul Alam Shikder, who is overseeing rescue operations, said 'Hopefully we will be able to control it.

Earlier, an announcement of Rana's 
arrest was greeted with cheers from people at the site. The man 
responsible for the eight-storey building - three of which were built 
illegally - is being brought back to the capital Dhaka by helicopter.

Survivor: A man was pulled from the building earlier today - the fifth day since the devastating collapse

It follows forty survivors being discovered yesterday, trapped in a partly-collapsed room beneath the wreckage.

Authorities said they will now use heavy equipment to drill a central hole from the top to look for survivors and dead bodies.

At least 362 people are confirmed dead in the collapse of the eight-story building that housed five garment factories.

The death toll is expected to rise 
further, but it is already the deadliest tragedy to hit Bangladesh's 
garment industry, which is worth 20 billion dollars (£13 billion) 
annually and a mainstay of the economy.

Wednesday's
collapse and previous disasters in garment factories have focused 
attention on the poor working conditions of workers who toil for as 
little as $38 (£24.50) a month to produce clothing for top international
brands. 

Army Major General Chowdhury Hasan 
Suhrawardy, the co-ordinator of the rescue operations, said they will 
try to save the nine people first by manually shifting concrete blocks 
with the help of light equipment such as pick axes and shovels.

Police say as many as 900 people are still missing in the aftermath of the collapse. This woman is one of nine survivors who were pulled from the rubble today

'But
if we fail we will start our next phase within hours,' which would 
involve manual efforts as well as heavy equipment. Hydraulic cranes and 
cutters will be used to bore a hole from the top of the collapsed 
building.

The hope is to 'continue the operation to recover both survivors and dead bodies.

'In this stage, we have no other choice but to use some heavy equipment.

'We will start it within a few hours. Manual operation and use of small equipment is not enough,' he said.

The work will be carried out carefully so as not to mutilate bodies, he said.

All the equipment is in place, 'from a
small blade to everything. We have engaged many private sector 
companies which supplied us equipment, even some heavy ones.'

In rare good news, a female worker was pulled out alive today.

Hasan
Akbari, a rescuer, said when he tried to extricate a man next to the 
woman, 'he said his body was being torn apart. So I had to let go. But 
God willing, we will be able to rescue him with more help very soon.'

Yesterday, police took six people into custody, including three owners of two factories who were placed under arrest.

Also
under detention are the wife of the building owner who is on the run 
and two government engineers who were involved in giving approval for 
the building design.

The owner had the approval to construct five floors but he added three more illegally.

A
huge crack appeared in the building, Rana Plaza, on Tuesday, but the 
owner, Mohammed Sohel Rana, assured tenants it was safe to go inside.

A
bank and some shops on the first floor shut their premises on Wednesday
after police ordered an evacuation, but managers of the garment 
factories on the upper floor told workers to continue their shifts.

40 survivors were yesterday found trapped in a room that had only partly-collapsed under the weight of crumbled concrete

Some people have survived five days in the wreckage with no food or water but 900 are counted as missing

Soldiers clear away the crumbled concrete of the Rana Plaza building. Fears are mounting that the death toll could rise far beyond the latest figure of 363

Hours later the Rana Plaza was reduced to rubble, and most victims were crushed by massive blocks of concrete and mortar falling on them.

A garment manufacturers' group said the factories in the building employed 3,122 workers, but it was not clear how many were inside it when it collapsed.

About 2,500 survivors have been accounted for.

Working round-the-clock, rescuers 
have used bare hands and shovels, passing chunks of brick and concrete 
down a human chain away from the collapsed structure.

On
the ground, mixed in the debris were several pairs of pink cotton 
pants, a mud-covered navy blue sock and a pile of green uncut fabric.

The
badly decomposed bodies pulled out of the rubble were kept at a 
makeshift morgue at the nearby Adharchandra High School before being 
handed over to families.

Authorities are now using heavy equipment to search for survivors. They said that the work will be carried out carefully so as not to mutilate bodies

Many people milled around at the school, waving photos of their missing loved ones.

Among those arrested are Bazlus Samad, managing director of New Wave Apparels Ltd, and Mahmudur Rahman Tapash, the company chairman, and Aminul Islam, chairman of Phantom Apparels Ltd.

Rana, the building owner, was a local leader of ruling Awami League's youth front.

His arrest, and that of the factory owners, was ordered by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is also the Awami League leader.

The disaster is the worst ever for 
the country's booming and powerful garment industry, surpassing a fire 
five months ago that killed 112 people and brought widespread pledges to
improve worker-safety standards.

But since then very little has changed in Bangladesh, where low wages have made it a magnet for numerous global brands.

Bangladesh's garment industry was the third largest in the world in 2011, after China and Italy, having grown rapidly in the past decade.

The country's minimum wage is the equivalent of about £24.50 a month.

Among the garment makers in the building were Phantom Apparels, Phantom Tac, Ether Tex, New Wave Style and New Wave Bottoms.

Altogether, they produced several million shirts, pants and other garments a year.

The New Wave companies, according to their website, make clothing for several major North American and European retailers.

Britain's Primark acknowledged it was using a factory in Rana Plaza, but many other retailers distanced themselves from the disaster, saying they were not involved with the factories at the time of the collapse or had not recently ordered garments from them.
