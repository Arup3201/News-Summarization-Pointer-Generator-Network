Icy: Forecasters say the temperature will plunge across the UK for the next five days, putting vulnerable peiople at risk.

An extreme weather warning has been issued by the Met Office over fears a five day cold snap could ravage the health of the elderly, young children and other vulnerable people.

Temperatures will plunge over the next five days, with much of the UK shuddering under temperatures of -2C and -3C, plunging to -6C in some areas.

Weather experts issued the 'severe weather action' - one alert level down from a national emergency - over fears the prolonged cold could hit the elderly and sick hard.

A Met Office spokesman said: 'The main thing we're concerned with is the cold and how it will have an effect on health, rather than travel and transport'

The warning states that: 'Prolonged periods of cold weather can be dangerous, especially for the very young, very old, or those with chronic diseases.'

'This weather could increase the health risks to vulnerable patients and disrupt the delivery of services.'

The snap looks set to continue into the 
start of next week. The high pressure means it will remain dry and 
settled for most through this period, although there will be a few snow 
flurries at time, particularly for eastern areas.

The cold will be heightened by strong 
winds dragged over the North Sea from Scandinavia and Siberia, 
especially in southern areas, which will also face 'penetrating 
overnight frosts'.

The Met Office also warned that roads and pavements are likely to be icy over the next five days, but no major disruption from snow is expected.

Sleet and snow hit the Pennines in Cumbria today, settling in some places. However, there was a stark contrast in the South, with residents of Southsea in Hampshire enjoying bright sunshine, ice creams and even a few people in t-shirts.

As well as the elderly, families with very young children and the seriously ill should take extra care

Last week the Mail reported the price
of heating oil has soared by 20 per cent in less than six months, 
putting the elderly and vulnerable at serious risk, campaigners say.

Householders
living in rural areas where there is no gas supply are being forced to 
spend as much as £1,750 a year to heat their homes compared to £1,350 
last year, Age UK believes.

In December, the cost of oil in some parts of the UK hit 70p per litre – compared to 54p earlier in the year.
