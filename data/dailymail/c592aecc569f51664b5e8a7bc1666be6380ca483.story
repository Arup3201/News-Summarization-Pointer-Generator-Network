Dorries: 'Boris is the silver bullet who will give the Tories a majority'

I wrote in this newspaper back in February that David Cameron should deploy the Tory Party secret weapon and invite Boris back into the Westminster fold. Now that has happened.

With Boris batting for the team, we have a much stronger chance of winning the next General Election.

Boris is our perfect anti-Nigel Farage weapon. Following his strongly Eurosceptic speech last week, Boris will undoubtedly coax back the voters who have temporarily left the Conservatives and dallied with Ukip. 

If anyone could be the silver bullet needed to take us clear across the majority line, the Mayor of London is it.

A victory for Cameron and George Osborne removes any leadership vacancy. However, Boris may have a further opportunity. 

In 2017, Cameron has pledged a referendum on Europe following renegotiation talks. It is well known that he will campaign for a Yes vote to stay in. Following his speech last week, it is very possible Boris will campaign for a No vote.

If he does and the No vote wins, the pressure will be on Cameron to resign. The question then will be which candidates MPs put forward to the party membership to elect as leader.

For the past 20 years, Osborne has carefully plotted his rise through the ranks. During reshuffles, he placed his acolytes in key positions. He has located his unofficial cheerleader for his campaign as future leader, Michael Gove, in the seat of Chief Whip. This means he has the controller of backbench opinion in his pocket.

Six months ago, Gove attended a private dinner with Rupert Murdoch. During the evening, he verbally disparaged both Boris and Theresa May and condemned them both as potential leaders. Osborne is anxious that none of Murdoch’s newspaper titles support Boris.

Gove is nothing if not a loyal servant to the present leadership, therefore it can only be assumed the comments were made not only with prior approval, but were planned.

But it is inconceivable that Boris would not be one of the final two choices for next leader. However, he has a great deal of work to do first.

Whereas Boris may have deployed a light touch on immigration as London Mayor, his message will need to alter dramatically to convince MPs. They will want to hear him say a Thatcherite ‘No, No, No,’ to open borders.

Boris needs to remind those MPs of his track record of success. He took an ailing London and has transformed it into a leading metropolis on the global stage.

If he can climb that mountain and reassure all MPs, Boris is indeed on course to be our next leader.

Supporters of Boris Johnson (left) are said to be privately vowing to force Prime Minister David Cameron (right) to quit if he tries to form a second Coalition with the Lib Dems, it has emerged

But what of Osborne? He will already be aware that a continuity candidate, in the form of himself or May, will not be acceptable to MPs or the party membership. The choice will be between Boris and a member of the 2010 intake.

My guess is that Osborne will already be negotiating with such an MP and helping to position them as a potential leadership candidate. The deal being that Osborne will persuade his people, the MPs he has rewarded and groomed over years, to support that candidate.

It won’t work. There is no MP in any party with the combination of talent and achievement that can rival the Boris stardust.

Unfortunately for Osborne, he is already yesterday’s man.
