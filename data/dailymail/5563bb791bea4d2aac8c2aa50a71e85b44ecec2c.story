A humpback whale carcass was towed away from Perth's coast on Monday evening after attracting several sharks.

Department of Fisheries spokesman Phil Shaw said sharks were seen feeding from the dead humpback whale which measured more than 10 metres in length.

The carcass was first spotted by the crew of a vessel returning from Rottnest just before 10am on Monday when it was five nautical miles off the coast.

A 10-metre long humpback whale carcass was seen floating  five nautical miles off the coast of Perth on Monday morning 

A number of sharks were seen feasting on the dead whale before the decision was made to tow it away from the coast 

By 2pm authorities had decided to tow the dead animal out to sea before hooking the animal by the tail, according to Nine News.

It was then towed out about 20 miles by a Fremantle Port authority vessel despite warnings that the carcass could break up.

Depending on the swell conditions and currents, Fisheries has warned that the whale could drift back towards the coast.

Mr Shaw said it was possible the whale carcass would continue to attract sharks.

People are being told to adhere to any beach closures, report shark sightings to Water Police and regularly check the Surf Life Saving Twitter account.

Last week, a 17-metre long humpback whale which washed up on Scarborough beach, northwest of Perth, took council workers several days to remove.

The removal procedure, which cost a total of $170,000, infuriated the City of Stirling Mayor Giovanni Italiano and the local council who argued that the carcass should have been towed out to see.

The City of Stirling wants the state government to reimburse the cost of the removal.

The decision to tow the whale comes one week after a 17-metre long humpback whale washed up on a West Australian beach, costing council workers $170,000 to remove over several days

The decision to tow the more recent humpback away from the coast has come despite warnings of impracticality from the Department of Parks and Wildlife last week.

'In practice, the towing of a whale carcass away from the coastline is an operationally difficult option, with practical difficulties around the size and mass of whales and, in some cases, the advanced state of decomposition,' the department said in a statement according to The West Australian.

'In addition, depending on the size of the carcass, an appropriately powered vessel would need to be identified and deployed to carry out any such towing operation.

'In most cases, given the nature of our coastline, the most appropriate course of action is to wait for the carcass to wash ashore.'
