Rick Dominicks had an unexpected visitor in his back yard over Thanksgiving weekend and it wasn't a distant relative.

The East Naples man discovered a 12-foot long carnivorous Burmese python sliding around in the bushes looking for it's next meal. 

Dominicks was already suspicious after five of his chickens disappeared in only one week. 'I didn't know what could have been getting the chickens,' Dominicks told NBC 2.

Rick Dominicks shot the 12-foot python to avoid becoming its next meal--though experts say to call a professional

'I guess [the snake] could be one of the culprits.'

After three of Dominick's landscapers told him they discovered a Burmese python when they were cleaning out his backyard, Dominicks grabbed his shotgun and went after predator.

'I didn't want him to get a hold of me,' he told Fox 4 news reporters.

As soon as Dominicks left his house, he discovered the slithery visitor hiding beneath some greenery.

'I was just scooping leaves off the top of him when he popped his head up and was right there,' Dominicks said.

Dominicks didn't hesitate to shoot the snake because he knew that pythons are not docile creatures.

Burmese Pythons have curved claws that make it easier for them to suffocate and consume prey

Fox 4 spoke with wildlife expert Steve Masek who told them that pythons are one of the largest snakes in the world.

Masek, who works at the Calusa Nature Center, said that Pythons are dangerous to both humans and animals.

'They want to suffocate you and that's 
when they're going to size you up to see if they can eat you,' Masek 
said.

He explains that pythons have curved fangs that make it easier for
them to wrap its body around humans and kill them before consuming 
them. 

Wildlife expert Steve Masek told Fox 4 reporters that just before winter is when pythons are likely to pop up in someone's garage or yard

Just before winter is the time of year people are most likely to spot the creature and they like to hide in garages, and boats. 

However NBC 2 reports that experts told them the python was probably not from the wild but was someone's pet that escaped. Backyard sightings are very rare.

As for whether or not it is legal to shoot a python, Fox 4 discovered that it's legal as long as it's on your own property. 

Whether the python wants to eat you or not, The Florida Wildlife Center said it's better to call a professional than to try and deal with the snake by yourself.

'I always keep an eye out for anything back there because you never know what's going to be back there,' Dominicks said.

If you spot a python you can call the exotic species hotline at 1-888-483-4861.
