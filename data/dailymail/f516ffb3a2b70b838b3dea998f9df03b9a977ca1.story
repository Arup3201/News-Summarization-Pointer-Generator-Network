This is the lucky baby who has finally been declared cancer-free after battling seven tumours since her birth just nine months ago.

Darcie Kay, from Canterbury in Kent, was diagnosed with infantile fibrosarcoma  at just seven weeks old and is thought to be the only child in Britain to have been born with the rare form of cancer.

She has battled through seven months of chemotherapy with a constant smile on her face, despite coming terrifyingly close to death after reacting badly to the drugs.

Still smiling: Darcie Kay was diagnosed with infantile fibrosarcoma when she was just seven weeks old

Delighted: Mother Natalie, 30, puts Darcie's amazing recovery down to her ability to be endlessly cheerful

Terrifying operation: The little girl had an operation in August to remove the tumour from her back, along with three ribs and part of her lung

Her relieved parents Natalie, 30, and 
Michael, 32, today put their cheerful daughter's remarkable recovery down to her naturally sunny disposition.

They are now looking forward to celebrating her first birthday free from the fear that has affected Darcie's entire childhood so far.

The little girl seemed perfectly healthy when she was born, weighing 8lbs 2oz, on January 7, but her mother soon noticed she was not feeding properly.

When Darcie was just three weeks old, Mrs Kay felt a lump on her back and immediately took her to the GP.

She was referred to the William Harvey Hospital in Kent, where doctors discovered a 7.5cm-long tumour growing from the tenth rib on the right-hand side of the baby's back.

Shocking discovery: The tumour in the little girl's back was 7.5cm long when her mother found it three weeks into her life, before doctors spotted six more lumps in her lungs

An ultrasound showed the tumour had blood vessels and Mr and Mrs Kay were told it was cancerous.

They also found a staggering six tumours in 
Darcie’s lungs. Fortunately, seven gruelling months of chemotherapy killed them and shrank the tumour in her back to 2cm so that doctors could remove it.

In August, she had drastic surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London to remove the tumour along 
with three ribs and part of her right lung.

Cheerful Darcie beamed happily throughout the painful cancer-killing treatment, despite coming frighteningly close to death in May.

Mother-of-four Mrs Kay said: 'Darcie has been absolutely amazing throughout her whole illness.

'People in the hospital would often comment that she hardly ever cried and she was always smiling.

'It was a real comfort for Michael and I to see her smiling - it kept us going. Darcie is such a happy little girl.

Absolute trooper: In May, Darcie began bleeding from the nose after having an adverse reaction to the chemotherapy and nearly dying

'I cannot put in to words how happy I am that Darcie has been given the all clear. Only now have I started to feel hopeful.

'Now we can hopefully have a normal family life and look forward to Darcie’s first birthday.

'Darcie’s illness has been really hard 
for the whole family. She has missed out on family events as we had to 
make sure she did not catch anything as her immune system was low.

'My sister even had to miss my 30th birthday as she had a cold sore and could not be near Darcie.'

Darcie needed nine cycles of chemotherapy starting on March 13 and had to have blood transfusions to help with her anaemia.

In May, she started bleeding from her nose and was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Specialist found she was having an adverse reaction to the chemotherapy which had poisoned her liver and she nearly died from hepatic veno-occlusive disease.

But Darcie pulled through - her last chemotherapy session was on October 18 and her latest tests have all come back clear.

The worry is over: Giggling Darcie has now pulled through and been given the all-clear at nine months

She has now tentatively been given the all-clear by medics, although she will still have to be monitored with three-monthly check-ups.

Healthy Darcie is looking forward to playing with her older brothers ten-year-old Kyran, Ashton, six, and Ollie, three.

Mrs Kay added: 'As soon as I felt the lump I knew it was not right. Darcie was as white a chalk.'When you hear the word cancer you think death. I thought "what have I done to deserve this?"

'If I could have died in that room I would have. I wanted a little girl so much after having three boys so I was devastated when I found out something was wrong with Darcie.

'I knew it was serious. After we found out we put Darcie in the car and Michael and I stood outside while I cried and cried.

'I pleaded with the doctors to save my little girl. The consultant oncologist Dr Tanzina Choudhury was brilliant and said "my aim is to save her", and she has worked a miracle.

'During Darcie’s treatment I planned her funeral in my head. I knew which songs she was going to have and I started planning what I would say.

'That is all I could do. I did not think there would be an end.

'Now we have her back.'
