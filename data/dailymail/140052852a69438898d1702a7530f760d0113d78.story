The Yemen branch of al-Qaeda appear to have claimed they directed the attack on the office of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

It comes after the gunman who held up a kosher grocery store in the east of Paris, killing four people, said he was 'fighting for the Islamic State' and wanted to kill Jews. 

A member of al-Qaeda in Yemen released a statement in English tonight saying that they had carefully chosen their target of the Charlie Hebdo office but stopped short of claiming responsibility.

Said and Cherif Kouachi, the brothers who had assassinated 12 people at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday. The Yemen branch of al-Qaeda appear to have claimed responsibility for the attack

On the run: French police surrounded an area north-east of Paris where the armed men, who killed 12 people in Paris on Wednesday, are believed to be hiding 

In a statement in English, the member said: 'The leadership of AQAP (al-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula) directed the operations and they have chosen their target carefully.

He added that the attack, which left 12 dead, was in line with warnings from the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to the West about 'the consequences of the persistence in the blasphemy against Muslim sanctities.'

Bin Laden was shot dead by US Navy seals in a raid on his compound in Pakistan on 2 May 2011. 

The member added the group has delayed its declaration of responsibility for 'security reasons' and spoke on condition of anonymity because of the group's regulations.

Said and Cherif Kouachi, the brothers who had assassinated 12 people at Charlie Hebdo, died in a blaze of gunfire at a printworks near Paris earlier today where they had been holed up with one hostage, who survived.

The Yemen branch of al-Qaeda's senior cleric Sheikh Harith al-Nadhari issued a recording on the group's Twitter feed commenting on the 'blessed raid on Paris.'

If confirmed, the attack would be the first time al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen has successfully carried out an operation in the West after at least two earlier attempts.

Soon after, the branch's senior cleric Sheikh Harith al-Nadhari issued a recording on the group's Twitter feed commenting on the 'blessed raid on Paris.' 

He denounced the 'filthy' French and called them 'the heads of infidelity who insult the prophets.' 

He praised the 'hero mujahedeen' who he said 'taught them a lesson and the limits of freedom of speech.'

Addressing the French, he said, 'It better for you to stop striking Muslims so you can live in peace. But if you only wish for war, then rejoice, you will not enjoy peace as long as you wage war on God and his prophets and fight Muslims.

'It is better for you to stop your aggression against the Muslims, so perhaps you will live safely. If you refuse but to wage war, then wait for the glad tiding.' 

It was not immediately clear why al-Nadhari did not outright said al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the attack.

Before his death, one of the Kouachi brothers, who were responsible for Wednesday's attack, told a television station he had received financing from an al Qaeda preacher in Yemen.

'I was sent, me, Cherif Kouachi, by Al Qaeda of Yemen.

'I went over there and it was Anwar al Awlaki who financed me,' he told BFM-TV by telephone, according to a recording aired by the channel after the siege was over.

Al Awlaki, an influential international recruiter for al Qaeda, was killed in September 2011 in a drone strike.

A senior Yemeni intelligence source earlier said that Kouachi's brother Said had also met al Awlaki during a stay in Yemen in 2011. 

Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal, which chronicles militant activities, said Yemen's branch of al-Qaeda has managed to seize territory inside Yemen, provide training and support for extremist groups operating in Syria, Iraq and other regions, and promote 'lone wolf' attacks in the West.

'They are active in the heart of the Middle East. They threaten the Yemeni government and they are directing their activities externally as well,' he said. 

'And they are serving to train and support in other theatres.'

These include a foiled plan to down a Detroit-bound airliner in 2009 using a new type of explosive hidden in the bomber's underwear, and another attempt a year later to send mail bombs hidden in toner cartridges on planes bound to the U.S. from the Gulf.

Amedy Coulibaly, right, the gunman responsible for taking 15 people hostage at a kosher deli in the east of Paris earlier today claimed he was 'fighting for the Islamic State'. His armed and dangerous wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, left, is on the run and is described as 'armed and dangerous' 

The group recently called for its supporters to carry out attacks in France, which is part of a US-led coalition conducting air strikes against Islamic State group jihadists in Iraq and Syria.

AQAP's English-language propaganda magazine 'Inspire' has urged jihadists to carry out 'lone wolf' attacks abroad. 

In 2013 it named Charlie Hebdo cartoonist and editor-in-chief Stephane Charbonnier among its list of targets.

Mr Charbonnier was one of 12 people killed in Paris on Wednesday by two gunmen who stormed the magazine's offices.

It comes after the gunman responsible for taking 15 people hostage at a kosher deli in the east of Paris earlier today claimed he was 'fighting for the Islamic State'.

It emerged tonight that four people had been killed while another five are critically wounded. As many as 30 had survived by hiding in a cold store where they kept silent for hours. 

It was revealed that Amedy Coulibay, 32, had telephoned a French TV station hours before he was killed by police.

He told BFMTV he was 'fighting for Islamic State', the militarised Islamic group who currently control huge swathes of Iraq and Syria, and wanted to kill Jews.

He added: 'I have sixteen hostages and I have killed four, and I targeted them because they were Jewish.'

Going in: Special forces storm the Jewish grocery to the east of Paris where terrorist Amedey Coulibaly had taken people hostage

Terrified: Hostages - who had been held for hours with Coulibaly threatening to kill them - flee from the shop, crying with relief. Coulibaly was shot dead and his wife is still on the run and is described as being 'armed and dangerous

The reporter he spoke to said that he claimed to have been acting under instructions from the terrorist group and that his actions were synchronised by the Kouachi brothers.

He is asked: 'Are you in contact with the two (Kouachi) brothers,' to which he answered: 'Yes we made contact before the operations.'

He then denied having been in contact with them recently and said he did not plan to take any further action.

In the end, the studio journalist described the gunman's claim that the kosher supermarket had been targeted and that he carried out the siege 'to defend Muslims... notably in Palestine.'

It is not yet clear when exactly the interviews were carried out but they are believed to have taken place hours before they were killed. 

A nationwide hunt is now underway to find his 'armed and dangerous' wife Hayat Boumeddiene, who is on the run tonight following his death after the store siege.

The Paris-born terrorist once belonged to the same Al-Qaeda group as the Kouachi brothers, who were also killed today after murdering 12 people in the Charlie Hebdo magazine slaughter on Wednesday.

The next day, Boumeddiene and his wife were both involved in the gun attack on Clarissa Jean-Philippe, a 27-year-old rookie traffic policewoman.

She had attended a routine traffic accident in Montrouge, south of Paris, at 8am when the couple struck.

A second victim - a street cleaner who was shot in the face after he confronted the couple - is still in a serious condition.
