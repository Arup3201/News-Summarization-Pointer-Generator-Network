Ronaldinho is in line to make his debut for Mexican side Queretaro this weekend and opponents Puebla seem to be making special plans for the former Barcelona forward's first appearance in Liga MX.

Puebla manager Jose Luis Sanchez Sola decided to make his players train in wolf masks in order for his defenders to hunt down their opponents in packs.

Sola revealed that he took inspiration from Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone to implement the idea in preparation for his side's showdown with Ronaldinho's new side on Saturday.

‘I saw a video of Simeone doing what we did without masks, with all the intensity of recovering the ball,’ he told the club’s website.

‘It’s sending the message with an anchor, the anchor is the mask. I understand that every time you go to play a ball and anchors you in the idea, remember you’re a dog, I have to go for it, fight it, steal it and defend it.’

Ronaldinho, who became a free agent in July after cancelling his contract with Brazilian outfit Atletico Mineiro, signed a two-year deal with Mexican side Queretaro at the end of last week.
