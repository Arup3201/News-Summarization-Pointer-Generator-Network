English referee Michael Oliver has been called up to a FIFA seminar for Europe's top young officials as football's governing body begin their early preparations for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

The 29-year-old ref, who took charge of Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Saturday, is the only English representative in a select group of 24 promising young officials earmarked as 'prespective referees' for future FIFA tournaments.

Howard Webb - widely regarded as England's top referee after taking charge of 2010's World Cup and Champions League finals - retired this summer, allowing other Englishmen to step up including Mark Clattenburg, who was overlooked for this summer's finals in Brazil.

But Oliver was criticised for being overzealous in showing Nacer Chadli a yellow card on Saturday

Oliver is the youngest referee invited to FIFA's Zurich headquarters for the November seminar, which includes practical, theoretical and physical activities as well as medical tests.

The Northumberland official was criticised by the likes of Matt Le Tissier and Jason Roberts for booking Nacer Chadli after his cupped-ear celebration in Saturday's North London derby.

He was the youngest referee to take charge of a Premier League game when he made his top flight debut in 2010 and has already been trusted with matches in the Europa League, and internationals, by UEFA.
