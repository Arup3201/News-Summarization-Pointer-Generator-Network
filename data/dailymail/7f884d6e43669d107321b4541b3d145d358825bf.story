Celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred is calling for Rush Limbaugh to be prosecuted on a defamation 
charge, saying an obscure Florida law can be used to punish him for 
calling a college student a 'slut' and a 'prostitute' on the air.

The 70-year-old sent a letter to the Palm Beach 
County Attorney's Office on Thursday saying prosecutors should consider a
 charge under an 1883 law making it a misdemeanor to question a woman's 
chastity.

'He has personally targeted her and 
vilified her, and he should have to bear the consequences of his 
extremely outrageous, tasteless and damaging conduct,' Allred said in a 
phone interview on Friday.

Limbaugh had no 
immediate comment on the letter and did not address it in his radio show on 
Friday. Rachel Nelson, a spokeswoman for Clear Channel's Premiere Radio 
Networks Inc., said the network had nothing further to add.

Denise
 Nieman, the county attorney, said she forwarded the letter to the state
 attorney's office, which handles criminal matters. The state attorney's
 office had no immediate comment.

Allred 
focused her efforts on Palm Beach because Limbaugh both lives and 
broadcasts his show from the county. She cited a state law that says, 'Whoever speaks of and concerning any woman, married or unmarried, 
falsely and maliciously imputing to her a want of chastity, shall be 
guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.'

Allred
 has a long history of taking on high-profile cases, most recently 
representing a woman who claimed to have been sexually harassed by 
former presidential candidate Herman Cain, and a woman who received lewd
 messages from former Rep. Anthony Weiner.

Whether
 prosecutors will take the request seriously and whether such a case 
could pose First Amendment issues remained to be seen. But the law 
should be used because it is still on the books, Allred said.

'I'm
 sure he has an army of highly paid attorneys in his entourage to advise
 him about how he should defend himself,' she said. 'I'm concerned about
 the impact that he has had and that he wished to have had on women who 
choose to speak out and exercise their free speech.'

The
 tumult began last week when Limbaugh discounted the appearance of a 
Georgetown law student, Sandra Fluke, on Capitol Hill. Fluke testified 
to congressional Democrats in support of their national health care 
policy that would compel her Catholic college's health plan to cover her
 birth control, a comment Limbaugh seized on.

He
 said last Wednesday: 'What does it say about the college coed ... who 
goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must
 be paid to have sex? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a 
prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex.'

After
 an outcry - and the decision by numerous businesses to pull their ads 
from his show - he apologised, saying: 'I should not have used the 
language I did, and it was wrong.' Allred called his apology 'meaningless'.
