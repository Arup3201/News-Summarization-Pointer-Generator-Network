This is the dramatic moment ‘thousands of tonnes’ of rocks came crashing down on to a popular holiday beach just yards from stunned onlookers.

The massive section of cliff collapsed on to Sidmouth beach, causing a huge cloud of red dust, covering daytrippers.

It was caught on camera by Tony Lane, 60, from the New Forest, Hampshire, who said he heard pebbles falling to the ground before the landslide at 5pm on Wednesday.

Landslide! Tourists move to safety on Sidmouth beach in Devon after part of the cliff comes crashing down 

The area on the Devon coast is prone to landslides, with residents worrying their homes will be at risk.

It also included trees from what is believed to be a household garden.

The most recent collapse comes after a man died as a result of a cliff fall in the area in 2012.

Mr Lane, a youth worker, said: ‘There was the sound of pebbles falling, then a few more pebbles and then a few seconds later some rocks started to come down.

Crashing down: The rocks fell to the ground at Sidmouth beach, causing a cloud of red dust

‘I sensed something was about to happen and just started to snap away.

‘Then there was a loud rumbling and a huge section of the cliff just gave way and went crashing to the beach.

‘A great cloud of dust rose up - people were just standing there watching in shock.

‘I'd say the nearest person could only have been 100 yards away.

‘The area covered by the landslide was pretty big.

Police have urged tourist to avoid the east end of the beach - where a man was killed by a cliff fall in 2012

‘If anyone had been nearer it there would have been no chance - they wouldn't have escaped - there must have been thousands of tonnes of rock.’

He added there were some trees from part of a household garden among the cliff fall.

‘Some small trees which were part of someone's garden came away I think,’ Mr Lane added.

‘There was a big scallop out of the cliff afterwards.’

Holidaymakers hide as 'thousands of tonnes' of rubble comes crashing down on Sidmouth beach

PC Jim Tyrrell, beat manager for Sidmouth town warned holidaymakers to be on their guard – and to avoid the east end of the beach.

He said: ‘It would be a timely reminder to the general public not to go on the beach at the eastern end of Sidmouth towards Salcombe Regis.

‘We do not want a repeat incident of what happened at Burton Bradstock in 2012 when a holidaymaker was killed as a result of a cliff fall.’
