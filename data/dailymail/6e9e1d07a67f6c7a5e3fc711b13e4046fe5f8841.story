A mother fears her 12-year-old son could be scarred for life after a tattoo he had on a family holiday left him with horrific leg injuries.

Ethan Crosland, from Rawthorpe, Huddersfield, was allowed the temporary Henna tattoo as a treat while on a family holiday to Egypt. 

But he was left in agony when it burst into raw blisters and left his leg red and swollen.

Ethan's mother, Emma Lindley, has warned others about the risks of getting tattoos on holiday 

Doctors are treating Ethan with antiseptic creams and antibiotics, but cannot rule out the tattoo leaving permanent scarring.

Now Ethan's mother, Emma Lindley, has warned others to beware of the risks.

She said: 'There were young toddlers racing around the hotel complex who had them done and things could really go wrong for them.

'We don't know why Ethan's tattoo has developed as it has but I wouldn't want others to go through what he has done'.

Ethan, a pupil at Rawthorpe High School, visited Sharm El Sheikh on August 3 for a two-week holiday with his five-year-old sister Tayler-Mae, mother and her partner, Marcus Pennington. 

They stayed at the four-star Aqua Blu resort, that boasts the biggest water park in the area.

The tattoo came up in huge blisters which were bursting when Ethan returned home from holiday in Egypt

Miss Lindley said: 'Unfortunately after a day or two, I had to take Ethan to the clinic as he had developed an ear infection.

'We think it was from swimming in the pools and the doctor advised him to stay out of the water for a few days.

'There was a salon on the complex with the henna tattoo parlour and as a treat for Ethan, I said he could have one done.

'He had it on his leg and it was fine for a few days. The tattooist said she would top it up the day we left so he went back and had it inked in again.

'But a couple of days after we got home, Ethan said his leg was really itching and we saw that the tattoo had come up in huge blisters which were bursting.

'He has been down to the doctor who has prescribed creams and more antibiotics, but we don't know if there will be any long-term damage'.

Ethan has to have the dragon tattoo covered in cream to try and bring down the swelling - and thankfully, the pain has eased thanks to the medical treatment.  

Earlier this year, seven-year-old Liam Sayer suffered a similar fate when he woke in agony with his back covered in sores and blisters after a reaction to a huge henna tattoo he had on his back.

He also had the tattoo done in Egypt during a two-week trip to the Titanic Beach Spa and Aquapark, in Hurghada, Egypt. 

He was told to avoid the sunshine for the remainder of the summer and doctors warned his worried mother that he may be forced to stay inside for the next two years as his body battles the horrific condition.
