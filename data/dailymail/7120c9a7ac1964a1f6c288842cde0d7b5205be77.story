It may look like a gravel pathway - but this grey stretch of road is actually the world's longest trampoline.

The rubber runway was installed as part of Russian art exhibition Archstoyanie 2012 - and lets visitors bounce along the full length of the road.

The trampoline measure an impressive 170ft long - the same length as 13 double decker buses.

As part of the 2012 Archstoyanie festival in Nikola-Lenivets, Russia, experts have created this gargantuan trampoline installation called Fast Track in a forest

Measuring nearly 170 feet, the bouncy road is thought to be the world's largest trampoline

The creators of the bouncy 'runway' have called it Fast Track

Visitors to the exhibition have been bouncing the length of the star exhibit since it was first installed last month.

The space of the festival, as a creative laboratory, builds a territory of experiments in different spheres of art, but foremost in architecture.

The Park provides a rare opportunity for Russian and foreign architects to act like artists by allowing them to create on the 'Archstoyanie' ground.

The performance art work by Andrei Bartenev was called 'Kiss of the Tree'

The central theme for this festival was Signs of Movement, here participants dressed in green body suits take part in a piece of moving art

The festival also features a number of weird and wonderful structures including this giant triumphal arch on the border between the forest and an empty field. The arch walls contain thousands of small traps for sunlight

The park and its space allow for much more opportunity than in an urban context.

Festival curator Anton Kochurkin said: 'The festival got a new quality level and is ready to outgrow the annual format.

'Here, on the ground, only useful things take root, the things which are necessary for this place and for the people who protect the place and master it gradually.

'On the territory of 'Archstoyanie' there remain objects in accordance to the spatial idea of the Park.

'Of course, art has no practical value but the task that we are working on is to extend the chain where the peace of art becomes irreplaceable, connected with the processes which take place on the area.'
