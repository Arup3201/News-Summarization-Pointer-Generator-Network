Apple has officially announced that September 10 will be the date it launches its much anticipated new iPhone 5s.

The event will take place at 10am Pacific time (5pm GMT) at the Apple Campus in Cupertino a week today and according to rumors will see the unveiling not only of new and improved smartphone but also for the low-cost iPhone, dubbed the 5C.

The 5S will reportedly come with a new and improved camera and in different colored options, while the iPhone 5C will feature a plastic backing but remain essentially the same technology-wise as the iPhone 5.

The firm sent out invites today to the 
press featuring the phrase, 'This should brighten everyone's day' along 
with a graphic depiction of multi-colored dots, which has led some to 
suggest indicates the new iPhone 5 will come in a variety of colors.

Launch Date: Apple has officially announced the launch date of September 10 for its new iPhone 5S

Indeed, the September 10 is due to be a bumper day for the Cupertino firm, with the announcement of iOS7, the first major overhaul of its mobile OS.

And the other highlights of the show will most likely include more details about iTunes Radio, which should launch for U.S. users on September 20th, along with iOS7.

As next week's Apple iPhone event draws nearer, new images of what is rumoured to be the iPhone 5C - boxed up and ready to be shipped - have been leaked online.

The photos, released by Chinese site iapps.im, show rows of the phones, with what is thought to be plastic casing, in pastel blue, pale yellow and powder pink.

Apple is rumoured to be releasing the iPhone 5C as a cheaper alternative to its upcoming iPhone 5S model at an event on September 10.

Before the event, experts predicted that Apple was also working on a 'candy-coloured' plastic version of its iPhone 5 handset and expected it to cost around £320. Leaked photos, pictured, showed the device with a matching wallpaper and case colour

The photos have since been removed by the Chinese site on the request of a 'relevant party', according to reports from Engadget.

In the images, each of the phones are also shown with a wallpaper in a corresponding colour. 

Rumours around Apple potentially launching two new handsets at an Autumn event surfaced in June.

They claimed that the California-based company wanted to launch a low-cost version of its iPhone 5 handset to compete with rivals Samsung. 

It will be the first time in Apple's iPhone history that the company has unveiled two handsets in the same month.

It
 was originally dubbed iPhone Mini, then iPhone Lite, and then leaked 
pictures from WeiPhone showing plastic cases suggest it could be called 
the iPhone 5C - with the C standing for colour.

The cheaper handset is expected to be made of plastic to keep costs
 down and may be sold in a range of colours including white, black, pink
 and blue.

According to analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets, the iPhone Mini could be made of plastic and could cost as little as £63 ($99).

Other prices put it much higher at £260 ($400) and it is likely to be closer in price to Apple's iPhone 4.

Apple does not comment on future products before its launch events.

Mark Gurman, a journalist for Apple fan site 9to5Mac wrote: 'Because of the uncertain track record of 
the source of the image and the image’s overall low quality, it is 
difficult to judge if the images are legitimate.'

He continues that they do, however, mirror the technique of matching a wallpaper to the outer casing as seen in 2012 during Apple's release of the iPod nano. 

Other leaked images of the phone have shown the case in dark red, blue and green.

If the iPhone C follows suit with the iPod nano design, it may be released in red, pink, yellow, blue, green, black and grey as well as white.

The cheaper iPhone will be an entry-level device to go with the high-end iPhone 5S, which is expected to come in gold, black and white, have a fingerprint scanner, dual-flash camera to improve the quality of photos, and a faster processor.

Rumours claim Apple's event will take place on the September 10 and the phones will be on sale around 10 days later, as has been the case in previous years.

Any devices launched will run Apple's latest iOS 7 software and U.S. models may also feature the new iTunes Radio.

Chinese site ETNews believes Apple could discontinue the iPhone 5 to focus solely on its rumoured, upcoming new models.

Earlier this year, industry analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets claimed Apple was working on a low-cost handset.

Dubbed iPhone Mini, iPhone Lite and now iPhone C, the new handset could come in a range of colours, be made of plastic, have a 3.5inch screen and a 5MP camera.

Prices being quoted range from £63 ($99) to £260 ($400).

Apple is also believed to working on large-screen device for its iPhone 6 model. The iPhone 6 could have a 4.7-inch screen.

There may also be a 5.7-inch screen iPhone model due next year.

Early rumours claimed the iPhone 5S was expected to be released on September 13, with the cheaper version due at the start of October.

Production problems were said to have pushed this date back, meaning the iPhone C would have been released before the high-end iPhone 5.

In August, the Wall Street Journal claimed suppliers in Asia had said Apple recently asked for prototypes of screens that are larger than 4-inches for the iPhone.

It is also said to be testing larger 13-inch iPad displays. This would make a jumbo iPad more than three inches bigger than the current model.
