A visibly-harassed Francois Hollande is said to be 'devastated' over a book by his ex-partner Valerie Trierweiler, which brands the French president callous and cynical.

Mr Hollande, pictured at the Nato summit today looking irked, is facing a media storm back home in France after Ms Trierweiler's intimate memoir portrayed him as a snob who secretly mocks poor people.

The book is a particularly unwelcome distraction at a time when Mr Hollande is under pressure in Wales for a deal between France and Russia over a warship. Speaking on the sidelines of the summit, he said the deal to supply two Mistral-class helicopter carriers was neither cancelled nor suspended, but the conditions for deliver were 'not in place'.

Back home Mr Hollande found an unlikely backer in his former partner Segolene Royal.

The mother of Mr Hollande's four children dismissed the attacks made by his former lover  Valerie Trierweiler as 'rubbish'.

The book,Thank You For This Moment, received a furious backlash in France, where politicians' private lives are not publicly aired.

Ms Royal, speaking on France's BFMTV early on Thursday, repeated several times that she would not comment on questions of a personal nature but reacted when the interviewer pressed her on Mr Hollande's alleged contempt for the poor.

'It's rubbish, it's the exact opposite of the political commitment of a great leader of the left,' she said.

'Do you think it's true?' Royal shot back to the interviewer. 'Can you think it is true about a politician you have known for years...?

'One must judge politicians by their acts,' she said, adding that Mr Hollande had a proven record of working for better conditions for the poor.'

Mr Hollande is reported to have sent a friend a text message saying he is 'devastated' by the book, which casts him as callous and cynical.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls said: 'I call for respect in the lives of everyone and dignity in public debate. 

'With these outrageous attacks, by mixing public and private life, we are dragging down the debate'.

With a stagnant economy and high unemployment, he added that the French  had far more important things on their mind such as 'jobs, housing and the high cost of living'.

An unlikely ally came in the shape of far-right leader Marine Le Pen, normally one of his fiercest critics, who dubbed the book a 'dishonour for France.'

She went on to describe the memoir, which became Amazon’s top seller on its first day,  as a 'profoundly indecent settling of scores' and a form of 'vengeance'.

Miss Trierweiler received an advance of some £70,000 for the first kiss-and-tell account of a serving head of state. 

The 49-year-old journalist, whose maiden name is Massonneau, recalls spending Christmas with her working-class family and Mr Hollande.

She writes that Mr Hollande quipped: 'They're not very nice, the Massonneau family.' 

She says her family 'is so typical of his electors', adding: 'He stood for election as a man who does not like the rich. In reality, the President does not like the poor. He, the man of the Left, calls them the toothless ones. He's very proud of his humour.'

Ms Royal, pictured in Paris on Thursday, appeared visibly irritated with her interviewer's line of questioning. She dismissed Valerie Trierweiler's book outright, defending her ex

She also describes the collapse of their nine-year affair after a gossip magazine published pictures of Mr Hollande visiting his mistress on a moped.

And she reveals he sent her 29 texts in one day trying to win her back – while still seeing his lover, TV actress Julie Gayet.

Extracts detailing the 'cruelty' of a 'passionate, possessive and mad' affair appeared yesterday in Paris Match magazine. 

Mr Hollande sacked Miss Trierweiler as his first lady on January 25 in a short official statement.

But she says he had already lied brazenly to her about Miss Gayet, 42.

She claims to have confronted him when rumours spread in December 2013, saying: 'Swear to me on my son's life that it's false and we won't talk about it any more'. He swears, and dismisses it as nonsense.'

When the truth emerged, she spent eight days in hospital for 'stress'.

Disturbingly, she writes: 'Julie Gayet was top of the morning news. I'm cracking up, I can't hear anything, I rush to the bathroom. I take the small plastic bag containing sleeping pills. Francois follows me. He tries to snatch the bag. 

'I run into the bedroom. The pills scatter on to the bed and floor. I manage to grab them. I swallow what I can. I want to sleep. I feel the storm about to break around me, and I don't have the strength to resist.' 

After their split, Mr Hollande attempted to remain in contact, said Miss Trierweiler, on one day 'sending me 29 text messages'.

Miss Trierweiler – known as the Rottweiler – claims that on August 12, his 60th birthday, when many were speculating he might marry Miss Gayet, Mr Hollande texted his former lover: 'It is up to you to say yes to me'.

Elysee Palace sources said the President – nicknamed Flanby, for a brand of caramel pudding – had been 'completely unaware of this book'.

Meanwhile Paris Match, where Miss Trierweiler works, describes it as 'both a scream of love and a slow descent into hell, a dive into the intimacy of a couple. Two people and nothing else – Valerie and Francois.'

Over 12 pages, it tells the story of Miss Trierweiler's 'passionate, possessive, mad love for this man whom I loved, who made me laugh, and who destabilised me deliciously'.

Miss Trierweiler says she felt 'dehumanised' throughout the Socialist politician's rise to power because she was seen as his mistress, and talks of feeling 'illegitimate' when Mr Hollande won the presidency in 2012.

Of the day he came to power, she writes: 'He's cold, he doesn't smile. I'm his stooge, but I have no value.'

The 320-page memoir is on sale in France following a massive 200,000 print run carried out in the strictest secrecy.

It is almost unprecedented. In 2013, Cecilia Attias, the second wife of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, cashed in with a book called A Desire for Truth.

However, it came out a year after he left office, and contained no intimate details.
