Mischief: Diana liked to venture out in disguise

As one of the most famous women in the world, she had to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid being recognised.

Princess Diana dressed up as a 'male model' so she could enjoy an anonymous night out at a gay bar with Queen singer Freddie Mercury, television entertainer Kenny Everett and his co-star Cleo Rocos, it has been claimed.

The Princess of Wales was a fan of the Kenny Everett Television Show and struck up a friendship with him and Miss Rocos.

It was during one of their many get-togethers that a drink at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in London was suggested.

Making the claims in her new book,  Miss Rocos sets the scene by describing how Mercury had also come round to  Everett's flat and the four of them were larking around on Everett's sofa watching The Golden Girls.

Miss Rocos wrote: 'I don't think anything could be more camp than Diana, Kenny, Freddie and me sitting on Kenny's sofa, all watching The Golden Girls.

'Kenny turned the sound down on the television and we improvised the voices, but with a much naughtier storyline.

'Kenny was Blanche, Diana was Dorothy, Freddie was Sophia and I was Rose – we were uncontrollable with laughter. Diana, who was 27 at the time, was giggling from behind a cushion and asked what our plans were for that evening.

'Freddie told her we were going to the Vauxhall Tavern. Diana said she had never heard of it and she'd like to come.'

Attempts
 were made to dissuade Diana but Miss Rocos said she was in 'mischief 
mode' and intent on having her way, adding: 'She turned to Mercury who 
declared: 'Go on, let the girl have some fun. Can you imagine?''.

Miss Rocos went on: 'She [Diana] wanted 
the thrill of going in undetected to order one drink and would leave 
right away, she promised.

'She tried on the outfit Kenny had 
intended to wear: a camouflage army jacket, hair tucked up into a 
leather cap and dark aviator sunglasses.

'Scrutinising her in the half light, we decided that the most famous icon  of the modern world might just – just – pass for a rather eccentrically dressed gay male model.'

The foursome arrived at the bar and Princess Diana ordered a white wine and a beer. With their mission accomplished, the group then made a swift exit and dropped Diana off at Kensington Palace.

The claims appear in Miss Rocos's new book, The Power of Positive Drinking. Diana's love of wearing a disguise to venture out in public unnoticed is well documented but this is the first time that her decision to dress up as a man for the 1988 bar visit has been revealed in such detail.

Miss Rocos, 50, also discloses how Diana was partial to a bellini – a cocktail made with champagne and peach juice or puree.

She said: 'There was always great excitement and anticipation after receiving an invitation for lunch with Princess Diana.

'She was a big fan of the Kenny Everett Television Show and we got to know each other over the years.

'She had a wicked sense of humour. We would meet and the three of us would swap all the fabulous gossip and goings-on.

'She would often refer to someone by their star sign, saying, “Oh, that randy old Taurean” or “typical Sagittarian, always dancing on the table with a bottle of vodka down his trousers”.'

Plan: Freddie Mercury and Kenny Everett  were behind the ruse according to the new book of Cleo Rocos

Among her other anecdotes, the actress 
recounts the time she and comedian Alan Carr raided a brothel in Soho to
 rescue the women working there, but were rebuffed.

'To our total shock none of them 
wanted to leave. Apparently they were all very happy working there and 
being well treated,' she said.

Miss Rocos also describes another occasion when she and Everett were invited to a reception at No 10.

They
 were waiting for a waitress to top up their glasses when Everett 
spotted one and tried to attract her attention. Miss Rocos recalled: 
'Waitress, waitress, he cried, before tugging at her arm. It was 
Margaret Thatcher.

'He did apologise profusely. However, the lady was not for turning again and she didn't go and get us a drink.'

 Rocos met Mr Everett when she was 15. She lied about her age to get on 
to his show in 1981, and ended up forging a firm friendship with the 
star which lasted until he died of Aids in 1995, aged 50.
