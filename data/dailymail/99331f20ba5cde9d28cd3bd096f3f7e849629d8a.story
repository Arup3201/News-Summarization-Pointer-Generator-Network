The family of a four-year-old boy who was shot twice outside his home has decided to move out of the area immediately.

Jhamarion Mulbah was hit in the arm and near his rib cage by two stray bullets as he played outside his Milwaukee home on Tuesday night.

His grandmother Rosemary Franklin, who was sitting on the porch with the boy's mother Jassmine Mulbah and one-year-old sister when the gunshots were fired, said the family would not spend another night in the area.

She said: 'I’m moving on. She’s moving, the 
mother’s moving and I’m moving. We getting out of here. Before night, 
we’ll be gone. Today, today. I’ve got keys, she’s got keys, we out.'

Mrs Mulbah said she initially thought the gunshots were firecrackers being set off so she did not move her children at first.

She said: 'I just happened to look across the 
street and I could see the fire coming out. I could see it coming off 
the barrel of the gun.

'My mom grabbed him and I have my one-year-old daughter. We grabbed her and we ran up in the house.'

Moving: Jhamarion's mother Jassmine Mulbah said the family were leaving their home immediately after her son was shot

Once they got inside, Mulbah realized her four-year-old son Jhamarion had been hit by the bullets.

She said: 'He was just screaming "Grammy, Grammy, Grammy". And that’s when we saw the blood just started dripping out.'

Jhamarion was taken to the hospital, where he was treated and released.

Mrs Mulbah said: 'Thank God he’s home and thank God like it didn’t kill him because he could be gone today.'

Since the shooting police have added security cameras and a vigil was held by loved ones and those in the community who are all calling for an end to the violence.

Police believe the gunman was firing at people a few houses away but no one has yet been arrested.

Tom Barrett, Mayor of Milwaukee, had harsh words on Wednesday for the shooter.

He
said: 'It's a pretty cowardly act to shoot a gun around a four-year-old
kid.  I hope people who know who shot this gun turns this person in.'
