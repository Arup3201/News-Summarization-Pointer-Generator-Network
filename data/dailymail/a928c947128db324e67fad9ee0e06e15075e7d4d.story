The brother of Sochi Olympic skeleton silver medalist Noelle Pikus-Pace along with his three children were finally found today after going missing while on an Idaho camping trip near the Gospel lakes over the weekend.

Jared and his children were found  walking near mountains about an hour away from their campsite. They were unharmed other than bravely sporting some poison ivy and mosquito bites.

Noelle Pikus-Pace posted an update on her Facebook just 15 minutes ago saying that Saturday morning after camping for the night, her brother and his children aged five, seven, and nine went fishing a couple of miles from their campsite and got lost after a fellow camper misdirected them.

yesterday walking along this road in Idaho

Spotted: This is the road in Idaho hours from Jared Pikus Pace's campsite where he was found walking with his three kids

Off the map: Noelle Pikus-Pace posted this map of her brother's approximate location near the Gospel Lake in Idaho where she believes he went missing

'They kept going thinking it would be around the bend. Night came so he used the raft that they had with them and slept beneath it.

They drank water from a snow stream and he said he bribed the kids to keep moving forward with a bag of jolly ranchers that he had in his backpack. The terrain was very rocky and steep. He said the kids were amazing,' wrote Noelle.

Rescue crews first started looking for Jared Pikus-Pace and his children on Sunday morning after they didn't return home on Saturday afternoon, reported NBC.

Pikus and his family were last seen by camper on Saturday in a non-hikeable area of the campground.

Jared has a wife at home along with three more children, including a very young baby.

Noelle called upon others to help find her brother and his family on her Facebook account today.

Her first post read, 'PLEASE say a prayer! My brother, Jared, and 3 of his kids went camping Friday and were supposed to come home yesterday morning. Search and rescue found their vehicle but can't find them! They are in northern Idaho.

His wife is at home with their other 3 kids including a very new baby. Please say a prayer for them and those looking for them!'

Later in the day Pikus took to her social media accounts again and even posted a map of her brother and his family's approximate location.

Swift as silver: Noelle Pikus-Pace won the silver Sochi Olympic medal for skeleton, a sport in which a person rides a sled face down at very high speeds

Her prayers were answered: Noelle asked friends and family to pray for her missing brother who was found with his three children today out of harm's way

'Search and rescue are still looking for my brother and his three little kids. This is where they are. They have helicopters and teams searching. They found their SUV and campsite. Still no sign of them. He was supposed to be back yesterday afternoon. Please keep them in your prayers! I'll keep you updated,' wrote Noelle Pikus-Pace.

Noelle feared for her brother's life because she heard that the terrain around the Gospel lakes is very rough.

'They said the terrain is pretty rough in the area. He went fishing with the kids at one of the Gospel lakes but they didn’t take a boat. They have life jackets and usually fish from the lake side, Pikus Pace told NBC.

'My husband, kids and I just spent a few days with them and were making our way home (stopping along the way). We were in Burley, about 6 hours south of their home and are now driving up there,' said Noelle.

Noelle asked friends and family to prayer for her brother and his family and thankfully her prayers were answered and her brother and his family are out of harm's way.
