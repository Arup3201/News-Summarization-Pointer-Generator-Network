Killed: Jill Meagher was found dead in September last year after failing to return home from a night out

The man accused of raping and murdering Irish journalist Jill Meagher left her body in a dark alley then returned home to fetch a spade with which to bury her, a court heard today.

Adrian Bayley is alleged to have attacked the victim as she was coming home from a night out, then strangled her to stop her reporting the crime.

The 41-year-old appeared in Melbourne Magistrates' Court today in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid being committed to a higher court.

Mrs Meagher, 29, from Co Louth, left a Melbourne bar to walk the short distance home at 1.30am on September 22 last year, prosecutor Gavin Silbert said.

Eight minutes later she was accosted by Bayley, who dragged her into a deserted alleyway, raped her three times and then strangled her 'because she was the only witness to the crime', according to the prosecutor.

Mr Silbert said Bayley left his victim lying in the alley and went back to his home in the suburb of Coburg, not far from where Mrs Meagher lived with her husband Tom.

Bayley then allegedly returned to the scene at 4.22am in his white saloon car after picking up a shovel.

He put Mrs Meagher’s body in the boot of the car and four minutes later drove to another town where he used the spade to dig a shallow grave at the side of a road and bury the Irish woman, the court heard.

Mr Silbert said that five days after the murder Bayley was interviewed by homicide detectives in a 22-hour interrogation.

During the interview, Bayley allegedly admitted to raping and strangling Mrs Meagher, and directed homicide detectives to where she was buried.

Mrs Meagher's husband, parents and brother were in the court for the first day of the committal hearing.

Mr Meagher had to leave the court in distress several times as the graphic details of his wife's murder were recounted.

Pathologist Matthew Lynch told the court that Mrs Meagher had been strangled with ‘sustained force’.

He said he had gone to the site where Mrs Meagher was buried at about 2am on September 27 after being told by homicide detectives that there had been a development in the search for the woman.

Dr Lynch said he helped remove dirt from the burial site and then assisted in bringing her body from the ground.

She was wearing some clothes, he said, and was lying on her left side.

When he carried out a post mortem examination later that morning he found evidence of neck compression.

He discovered haemorrhages and bruising on her neck, along with bleeding in neck muscles and fractures to her larynx.

Dr Lynch said those injuries suggested manual compression involving sustained force.

Under cross examination from Bayley’s defence lawyer, Dr Lynch said it was possible Mrs Meagher could have died if the force of the neck compression had ceased when she was unconscious while lying on her back with her airway blocked.

At the end of today’s hearing, Bayley stood in the dock and pleaded guilty to one count of rape but not guilty to murder.

He also pleaded not guilty to a further two counts of rape.

Mr Meagher stormed from the court, visibly upset, after Bayley announced his pleas.

The defendant has been committed to stand trial in the Victorian Supreme Court on a date to be arranged.
