Deirdre 'White Dee' Kelly pocketed £1,500 last night as she spent two hours partying with students who had turned out to take a 'selfie' with the controversial star.

The 43-year-old Benefits Street star was mobbed by thousands of revellers and  handed gifts of chocolate as she visited Paris Nightclub and The Viper Rooms in Sheffield for two Freshers' Week events.

The most controversial resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street was initially scheduled to spend 30 minutes at each of the clubs - and charged her usual £1,500 hourly rate for the privilege.

Deirdre 'White Dee' Kelly pocketed £1,500 last night as she partied with thousands of students during two personal appearances at nightclubs in Sheffield

The most controversial resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street posed for 'hundreds' of selfies during the Freshers' Week events, her manager said

There were queues of people lining up, waiting for their chance to have their photo taken with the controversial star

Miss Kelly was initially scheduled to spend 30 minutes at each club, charging her £1,500 hourly rate - but the sheer amount of people meant she was there for two-and-a-half hours

But her manager Barry Tomes told MailOnline she was having so much fun that she stayed for more than two-and-a-half hours - and didn't charge a penny in overtime.

He said: 'It was absolutely pandemonium. The clubs are opposite each other and it took us at least half an hour to even cross the road from one to the other - that's how many people there were.

'She wanted to stick around and talk to some of the students but we had to just keep rushing people on, because it was so busy. 

'It was like she ended up doing two personal appearances in the clubs and a third in the middle of the street.'

He added: 'There must have been about 5,000 people there altogether, all there to see White Dee. Some even gave her chocolate. 

'She was meant to be there for an hour altogether, but she ended up staying for about two-and-a-half hours. We were having so much fun.

'She must have posed for hundreds of selfies and I took so many photos. They were all chanting "White Dee, White Dee" and would run off all excited once they had got their photo - it was like they had met The Pope or something.' 

Her manager Barry Tomes said Miss Kelly decided to stay longer because there were so many people - and she was having 'so much fun'

He told MailOnline it was 'absolute pandemonium' and that some 5,000 revellers were there to see the mother-of-two

These two students looked pleased as punch to have met the 43-year-old during their night out 

Miss Kelly was evidently having a great time and was seen hugging, laughing and joking with the students

The meet-and-greet was the latest in a string of public appearances which have been lined up for the mother-of-two since she shot into the headlines for her appearance on Benefits Street.

Since she starred in Channel 4's  fly-on-the-wall show in January, Miss Kelly has used her TV profile to rake in fees from a number of public events, meaning she is no relying on state handouts.

Her appearance last night was also a far cry from the image she portrayed during the controversial series.

She arrived at the clubs donning a black and white floral number, with her hair cut into a stylish bob and her nails newly-manicured. 

Mr Tomes said she often goes to get her hair and nails done before a public event 'just like any woman would'.

He said she had been to the hairdressers in Birmingham and joked that she is 'getting all a bit Bet Lynch on me'.

White Dee has a busy schedule - and is now being invited to student debating societies after she demanded politicians do more to get people into work

The reality star's relentless schedule continues tomorrow, when she will present an award at the BritAsia awards event at the NIA in Birmingham. 

Mr Tomes said she has had a bespoke sari specially-made for the occasion - with an inbuilt cigarette pocket.

And, on Monday, she is meeting with producers from an Asian TV company to talk about filming a series in Asia, in which she will visit slums around the continent, asking how they cope without benefits.

She is also being invited to student debating societies after she appeared at the Tory party conference and demanded the government do more to get people into work.

And she has still not ruled out standing as an MP next year - even though it would mean a pay cut.

With her new found fame, Miss Kelly is set to pay 40 per cent income tax just months after finding fame as a long-term welfare claimant

With her new found fame, Miss Kelly is set to pay 40 per cent income tax just months after finding fame as a long-term welfare claimant.   

When she appeared on the documentary her last full-time job had been at Birmingham City Council - from which she was fired in 2007, and narrowly avoided a jail sentence, for stealing £13,000. 

She was immediately controversial when she was shown swearing repeatedly at her children and having little motivation to search for a job after years of unemployment. 

In the months after Benefits Street she began cashing in on her notoriety, flying to Magaluf where she downed shots with punters while still claiming sickness benefits.

She then stopped claiming state handouts in May, and has since built a career around her status as a TV personality. 

The mother-of-two shot into headlines in January for her bullish appearances on Channel 4's controversial fly-on-the-wall show Benefits Street

Mr Tomes claimed she is 'easily' earning at the 40 per cent tax rate and has often pulled in fees from several nightclubs a night

Miss Kelly appeared on Celebrity Big Brother and will feature in a Channel 5 documentary on her new lifestyle from January.

Mr Tomes claimed she is 'easily' earning at the 40 per cent tax rate and has often pulled in fees from several nightclubs a night - though she still makes less than big names from The Only Way is Essex.  

The culmination of her unusual new life came on Monday when she appeared at a fringe event at the Tory party conference - and admitted the life she had boasted of living previously was 'unfair'.

She said: 'It's not fair that someone works a 40-hour, if not more, week and doesn't have as much to live on as someone who sits at home, doesn't work and is given money from the Government. 

Big ambitions: The 43-year-old has still not ruled out standing as an MP - even though it would earn her less

Well-known: The resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street shot into the headlines on C4's Benefits Street

'But that's not that individual's fault, that is the Government's fault. I think the Government also has to look at (the) minimum wage and things like that.

Long road travelled: This week she appeared at the Tory conference and has been invited to student debates

'It's the Government that says how much someone is entitled to to live on, not the individual.'  

She also laid in to government policy, saying: 'I have experienced some not very nice job centres,.

'You do just go in, you sit down, you are looked down upon.' 

They just need to understand that, just because you are on benefits does not mean that you are not a real person. Just because you are on benefits doesn't mean that you are not physically looking for a job.' 

Miss Kelly has still not ruled out standing as an MP next year, despite reports that she no longer wants to because she earns more as a 'celebrity'.

'I've said she should put it on the back burner for ten years because she wouldn't be able to be as outspoken or do as many appearances', Mr Tomes said.

'Why would she want to be an MP on £60,000 when she would be very restricted on what she would be doing?' 

Almost 900 viewers complained to Ofcom after Benefits Street was aired.

Many of them  said the residents had been misrepresented, children were exploited and the show was 'poverty porn' which demonised those on benefits.

In a lengthy decision, the regulator  ruled there had been no breach of the broadcasting code.
