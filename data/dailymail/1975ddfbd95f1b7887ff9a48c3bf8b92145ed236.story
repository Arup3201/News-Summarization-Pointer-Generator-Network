Prince Harry is to add some royal cheer to festive celebrations at Camp Bastion by serving up Christmas lunch.

The third in line has offered to help out by carving a huge turkey to dish out to hundreds
 of junior soldiers at Camp Bastion.

It is a tradition for officers
 to treat lower ranks to their meal on Christmas Day, but will be in 
strict contrast to the lavish meal the Apache pilot has served up by 
butlers every year at Sandringham with the royal family.

After his hard work, Prince Harry will be able to sit down at the brightly-decorated trestle tables and eat with his comrades, reports the Daily Mirror.

And then after lunch he will spend Christmas Day with the Royle Family - even though he is 4,000 milse away in Afghanistan.

The BBC comedy will air in Camp Bastion via the British Forces Broadcasting Service - and Harry is expected to watch it after his daily duties as an Apache helicopter pilot.

The 28-year-old will later have the opportunity to talk to his family on video-calling software Skype.

 Prince Harry was deployed in September as part of the helicopter team tracking down and destroying Taliban targets.

It
 was a return to the front line for Captain Harry Wales, as he is known 
in the army, having previously served a 10-week stint from December 
2007.

The tour was shrouded in secrecy and Harry was forced to return home early after news of his presence leaked out.

When
 the royal flew back to the war zone in September for a four-month tour 
with the Army Air Corps, St James’s Palace said Prince Charles was 
'immensely proud of his son'.

Recently Prince Charles has admitted being wracked with worry while his 
officer sons are serving on the frontline, telling families of the armed
 forces 'I really do understand' during an emotional speech.

The 
Prince of Wales told families at a military awards evening how he had to
 persuade his youngest son to write to him, but that fortunately 'he calls every now 
and then.'

Charles, 64, who was speaking at The Sun's Military 
Awards event, held to honour the bravery of the armed forces, said: 'As 
you can imagine being a parent of two boys in the armed forces, I do 
share with you the worry and anxiety of not knowing the exact details of
 our children's whereabouts.'

Son Prince William also serves as an RAF search and rescue helicopter pilot.

Soliders serving in Afghanistan over 
the festive season have already been given a royal morale boost when 
they received a visit from the Princess Royal this week.

Princess Anne flew into Camp Bastion to be shown around by a number of units to see the work they are doing.

The
 princess, who was accompanied by her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim 
Laurence, was shown around Camp Tombstone where the Royal Scots 
Borderers, 1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (1 Scots) are 
based.

The battalion, 
which is based at Dreghorn Barracks in Edinburgh, left Scotland in 
September to complete a six-month tour of Afghanistan.

They have been working with members of the Afghan National Army in Camp Shorabak, which is the Afghan base attached to Bastion, in an advisory and training role.

Major Andy Watson, 33, from Edinburgh, said: 'The visit is fantastic. It was a nice surprise as we only found out about it at the last minute for security reasons.

'We were showing off a series of photographs to demonstrate what we've done and our approach to our mission over the past three months, and also some equipment as well. For many of the Jocks it's the first time they've met Her Royal Highness, so for morale it's fantastic - especially this close to Christmas.'
