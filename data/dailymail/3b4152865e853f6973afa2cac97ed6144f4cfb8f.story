Hotel staffers in North Korea have revealed that Dennis Rodman was drunk, uncontrollable and destructive during one of his recent trips to North Korea.

The first public sign that his known substance abuse problems had appeared again came during his caustic interview on CNN but new reports from South Korean papers reveal that people who dealt with him during his trip in December had been keeping earlier problems quiet.

'Rodman was drunk the whole week of his stay. And the night before he left for the U.S., he was drunk unconscious, and vomited everywhere he turned. He even urinated and emptied the bowels in the hallway,' a source told Free North Korea Radio.

Path of destruction: Dennis Rodman stayed in the Koryo Hotel in Pyongyang during his December 19 visit to North Korea and now a South Korean paper has released anonymous comments about his behavior

The former NBA star has visited the country four times now and these latest claims- which were published in South Korea- refer to his time at the Koryo Hotel.

He was pictured at that hotel during his December trip where he helped train the basketball team, but it was reportedly his drinking during the January visit that prompted him to enter a rehabilitation facility after returning to the U.S.

It comes as little surprise that the unnnamed sources told the South Korean paper that Rodman's supposed antics not only reflected poorly on him but also on the country's feared leader.

'The stench was just horrible and people are criticizing not only Rodman, but also Kim Jong-un saying that "No one in a right mind would be a friend with Rodman. An animal that he is,"â€™ the source said.

He supposedly was given a warning when he left- though it is unclear who issued the warning- saying that he would not be welcomed back until he cleaned up his act.

'Never will you be welcome here without the completion of your alcohol abuse treatment program,' the source told the paper.

Earlier reports from Rodman's friends said that the athlete was 'plied with alcohol' as soon as he landed in the rogue state on a subsequent visit, which was timed to coincide with Kim Jong Un's birthday on January 8.

Gift: A bottle of vodka with illustrations of Rodman and the North Korean leader was presented to the athlete

Treatment: Dennis Rodman checked into rehab after a trip to North Korea, where he was presented with bottles of vodka decorated with a picture of him and Kim Jong-un

Upon his arrival that time, he was 
greeted with personalized bottles of vodka that had pictures of Rodman 
and Kim Jong Un drawn on them.

Rodman checked into a rehabilitation program after returning to the United States.

This is not the first time that Rodman, 52, has received treatment for his addiction to alcohol, having gone through the process in 2008, in 2009 as part of his time on Celebrity Apprentice and a second time later that year as part of the show Celebrity Rehab With Dr Drew.

Since entering the New Jersey facility, Rodman gave an interview to CNN's Chris Cuomo where he apologized for his comments during the North Korean trip where he faulted American missionary Kenneth Bae for his imprisonment.

Judgment: The anonymous sources cited by the South Korean paper said that Rodman's behavior reflected poorly on the feared North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un

'I have sympathy - I don't want anyone in any country or anywhere in the world to be hostage for something maybe they did or did not do,' Rodman said in Friday's interview.

'I would do anything ... if they said, "We'll take Dennis Rodman and we'll let Kenneth Bae go," you know what? I'd do that, straight ahead. Take me. I would do that.'
