Whitehall staff have been ordered to take down ‘inappropriate’ Diamond Jubilee bunting and scolded for breaking health and safety rules by ‘standing on tables and chairs’ to put it up.

In an extraordinary leaked email, workers in the Cabinet Office and the Treasury are told that it is ‘clearly not sensible’ to have put up Jubilee decorations.

They are also warned that it is ‘potentially embarrassing’ for the Government if office walls are revealed to be ‘strewn with non-work-related posters and notices’ – and further reprimanded for using colour printers to make the decorations in breach of eco-friendly workplace rules.

Still flying the flag: Bunting remains at the Treasury despite the stern edict against bunting

Staff are told bunting must be removed – though they are warned that they ‘shouldn’t attempt to take it down themselves’ and advised to call a helpdesk.

One member of staff said the message had
 initially been assumed to be a joke but had caused widespread anger 
when it was established that it was genuine.

The Government has launched a concerted 
effort to rein in Britain’s health and safety culture, making the 
message leaked to the Daily Mail from the heart of Whitehall still more 
embarrassing.

Last night, after the Mail brought the 
warning to the attention of Chancellor George Osborne, the edict was 
overruled. He told staff that they should ignore the instructions and 
encouraged them to ‘cover the building’ with Jubilee bunting.

Staff were warned that non-work-related posters should be removed from offices to avoid potential embarrassment for the Government

Despite the banning of bunting elsewhere in Whitehall, Downing Street displayed its colours with pride at the start of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations this weekend

An aide to Mr Osborne said: ‘As loyal servants to Her Majesty, the Chancellor was delighted to hear officials have got into the Jubilee spirit in such a way. The bunting is still up and is staying up.'

Employment minister Chris Grayling, who is responsible for health and safety law, said: ‘No one anywhere in the country should feel that they can’t have bunting and decorations up to celebrate the Jubilee. Health and safety law is all about protecting people in high-risk workplaces. It is not about ruining the fun of the Jubilee.’

Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘This is typical of the killjoys and jobsworths that pervade parts of Whitehall and the civil service.’

The email was sent on Thursday by Sue Morris, head of ‘supplier management’ at an organisation named Joint Workplace Solutions, a division of the Treasury.

Addressing staff on a shared floor of the Cabinet Office and the Treasury, she  wrote: ‘I note that some of the teams have decorated the area with bunting that has been strung from the ceiling and light fittings. I assume this was put up by standing on tables and chairs – clearly not sensible from a H&S aspect and not something we want to encourage.

‘It’s also not appropriate to tie anything to the light fittings. As well as the H&S concerns, the appearance of this isn’t appropriate to a professional workplace – particularly a multi-occupancy building like this. The bunting needs to be removed and I’d be grateful if you could speak to whoever is responsible. However staff shouldn’t attempt to take it down themselves – please ensure that they call the helpdesk instead.’

Mrs Morris expressed further concern that some of the Jubilee decorations appeared to have been made from ‘A4 coloured printed pages which I assume have been produced on the Flex printers’.

She added: ‘If this is the case, then could you also please remind your colleagues that that’s not an appropriate use of these fairly expensive resources … colour printing needs to be used sparingly and only for work purposes.’
