Detained: Juegers Veloz has been identified as a suspect in a $250 million cell phone cloning scheme

Spanish police have arrested one of America's Most Wanted, believed to be behind a $250 million mobile phone fraud.

Juegers Veloz, 37, is accused of being part of a criminal network that stole account information to clone phones which it then sold so users could make fraudulent calls across the world for free.

The Dominican national was detained in a call centre on the Spanish holiday island of Mallorca on Thursday, where he'd been living for two years.

He was listed among the eight Most Wanted by the U.S. Secret Service - an agency tasked with combating major financial crime which threatens the American economy.

Diario de Mallorca reports that the sophisticated fraud was carried out between 2009 and September 2011 in and around the city of New York.

Veloz's gang allegedly illegally cloned victim's phones.

They are then accused of selling the cloned phones to customers, who paid a regular rental fee for its use. The phone call charges were billed to the original owner.

The gang had 12 members, who all carried out different roles.

Veloz was allegedly in charge of providing information on the victims and to recruiting new 'clients' to the network.

The Spanish Interior Ministry said the owners of the phones were hit with $17million bills, while the gang reportedly netted more than $250million.

Five alleged members of the group were arrested in America in February 2012.

International arrest warrants were issued for the remaining suspects.

Most wanted: Juegers Veloz was among eight people one the U.S. Secret Service's list of highest priority targets

Veloz fled the U.S. to Mallorca, where police got wind of his location last week. They carried out surveillance for several days until 11:30am on Thursday when they arrested him in a call centre.

Taken to a police station, Veloz was remanded in custody. He is expected to be extradited to the U.S. in the next week. He faces 20 years in jail if convicted.

Veloz's detention eliminates one of the eight most wanted from the U.S. Secret Service's list of major targets.

The agency, which is tasked with safeguarding the nation's financial 
infrastructure, payment systems and generally presurve the integrity of the 
economy from fraud, deals with the biggest suspected fraudsters in the country.
