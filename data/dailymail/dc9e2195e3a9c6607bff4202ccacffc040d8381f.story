Stoke City manager Mark Hughes risks upsetting his oldest friends when he faces hometown club Wrexham in the FA Cup third round.

Hughes followed Wrexham as a schoolboy and his first ever live game was an FA Cup quarter-final they played against Burnley in 1974.

The north Wales club, now 14th in the Conference, will take 5,000 fans to the Britannia Stadium, and Hughes will know many of them. ‘Certainly, a lot of my mates are coming and they will be behind the goal with the Wrexham fans,’ he said.

The Stoke boss was delighted with his side's performance against Manchester United 

‘I will know a lot of people following Wrexham so I hope they have a good time — but not too good.’

Wrexham were a Third Division side when Hughes started going to their games as a nine-year-old, and as Welsh Cup winners enjoyed some great European nights at The Racecourse. 

He added: ‘I am looking forward to the game, it will be a great FA Cup day. I am pleased for them because a draw like this is important for their finances but for us, we just need to get the job done.

‘It is a competition we want to progress in. Wrexham will come here with a lot of heart and endeavour but we should win if we do the job right.’

Ryan Shawcross scored in his side's 1-1 draw with Manchester United
