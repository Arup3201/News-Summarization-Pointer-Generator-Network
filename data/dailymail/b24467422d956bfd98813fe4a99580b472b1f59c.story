Party: Dara Preece Gehringer (above) said she met Prince Andrew in the exclusive resort in St Tropez

One of Jeffrey Epstein’s troupe of girls told yesterday how Prince Andrew attended a party as a guest of the paedophile in St Tropez.

Dara Preece Gehringer said she met the prince in the exclusive resort after being flown there in Epstein’s private jet for an evening of entertainment.

But she said she was ‘dumbfounded’ by claims he abused a girl at an under-age orgy.

Leaping to the defence of Andrew, who is engulfed by claims that 17-year-old ‘sex slave’ Virginia Roberts was forced to sleep with him, Miss Gehringer said that when she met the prince he was a ‘gentleman’ and certainly not an abuser.

The Duke of York, 54, fiercely denies Miss Roberts’ allegations levelled in US court papers.

Yesterday Miss Gehringer became the first of Epstein’s ‘good-time girls’ to speak out – telling how she was one of a group of young women flown by the billionaire on his private jet to St Tropez in Southern France for an evening of entertainment in 2001.

She said: ‘I flew on Jeffrey’s private jet and we had dinner with Andrew. He seemed relaxed. He was wonderful and a gentleman.’

She described Miss Roberts’ claims as ‘extremely unlikely’, telling the Mail: ‘I’m dumbfounded. I can’t believe he took part in anything like that. That’s my opinion. He was nothing but pleasant to me.’

Miss Gehringer, who still counts herself as a friend of Mr Epstein, was in her early 20s at the time and said she is now a 37-year-old mother-of-three who lives a ‘different life’.

She said of Epstein: ‘I have never seen anything inappropriate. That’s why it was such a shock, all that was very surprising to me.’

Miss Gehringer also had harsh words for Miss Roberts. ‘I don’t have the highest opinion of that girl,’ she said.

‘If everything that went down the way she said, I just have a hard time believing it because they (Epstein and his friends) are not people like that.’

But a former boyfriend of Miss Roberts, Anthony Figueroa, claimed she told of how the duke ‘didn’t act very royally’ around her.

The Florida barman, now 32, who dated Miss Roberts at the time of the alleged incidents, said: ‘She said she was scared because she didn’t know how angry Jeffrey would get.

‘When it came to the Prince, I didn’t hear anything good. She said he wasn’t acting very royally.’

There is no suggestion Andrew was aware of any pressure being exerted on Miss Roberts, who has gone into hiding in Colorado since her explosive claims about Andrew and Epstein were filed at a courthouse in Palm Beach, Florida, last week.

Epstein has denied the claims, saying they are made up.

Epstein served 13 months in jail for paedophile offences in 2008 after even more serious charges against him, involving some 40 women, were dropped.

The Mail has uncovered a massive cover-up in which Epstein tracked down witnesses and warned them off testifying against him.

Miss Roberts and four other alleged victims continue to make allegations against him.

In a 2009 legal document uncovered by the Mail, Miss Roberts claimed she was abused by ‘royalty’, ‘politicians’ and ‘academicians’ who were friendly with Epstein.

The statement outlines how Epstein and his friends would abuse Miss Roberts on private flights.

‘Most of these acts of abuse occurred during a time when [Epstein] knew that [Miss Roberts] was approximately 15, 16 and 17 years old,’ it said.

Top US lawyer: Alan Dershowitz (pictured) has denounced Virginia Roberts as a 'serial liar'

A top US lawyer has urged Prince Andrew to join him in taking legal action against the woman at the heart of the ‘sex slave’ claims.

Alan Dershowitz, 76, denounced Virginia Roberts, 30, as a ‘serial liar’ after she alleged she was forced to have sex with him and the 54-year-old prince.

The Harvard law professor, who was one of OJ Simpson’s lawyers, filed a sworn statement to a Florida court in which he vehemently denied ever having any sexual contact with Miss Roberts. 

He had represented Jeffrey Epstein when he was investigated by American police in 2005 to 2007 for sexually abusing underage girls. 

The lawyer helped to negotiate an extraordinary plea bargain with US prosecutors that resulted in the billionaire spending just 13 months in prison.

He has launched a legal battle to clear his name and encouraged the Duke of York to lend his weight to his legal fight.

But one source told the Mail that Andrew has ‘no plans’ to take legal action in connection with the allegations made in the US.
