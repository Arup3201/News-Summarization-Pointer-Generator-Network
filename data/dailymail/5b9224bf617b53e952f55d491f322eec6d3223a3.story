Police are searching for a 25-year-old diabetic mother who went missing on Thursday after calling friends to tell them she was with a 'known sex offender' who was 'acting weird' and making her nervous.

Jaimee Mendez vanished from Swampscott, Massachusetts, after making phone calls saying she wanted to leave as the unknown male was making her feel uncomfortable.

One agreed to help and drove to pick her up, but when he arrived she wasn't there.

Her family have said she was in the company of a convicted sex offender when she was last heard from, but he has not been named.  

Missing: Jaimee Mendez  from Swampscott, Massachusetts, vanished on Thursday after calling friends to say she was with a man who was 'acting weird'. She has a severely autistic five-year-old son

Plea: The 25-year-old mother asked those who she called to come and pick her up. One agreed to help but when he arrived Jaimee was nowhere to be seen

Investigators found her phone, jacket and ID dumped in a parking lot five miles away in Salem on Sunday and confirmed she did not have her vital medicines, including insulin, with her.

A short time later, they then discovered her sneakers,  a rug and men's clothing in a dumpster outside a CVS in nearby Lynn.

Her father Stephen told NBC she cannot go for more than four days without her insulin and said she has never spent a day away from her five-year-old son, who is severely autistic.

'She still can't go four days without her insulin. Her son is severely autistic. She would be home to see him every single day. She would never - I don't think she's ever spent a day away from her son

Jaimee's teary sister Alyssa added: 'She was worried, she was freaked out, she was with this guy, he was acting weird, she wanted to get out of there.

'The guy that she called went to pick her up and she never showed. And that's it. That's the last time anyone heard from her. Her phone's been off, until they found her phone - they found her phone and her jacket, and her ID in Salem.'

Officers from several neighboring communities have joined the search in a wooded area in Lynn.

No arrests have been made and the authorities insist it is an open investigation. 

The Essex County District Attorney's office told Mail Online that they could not comment.

Concerned: Jaimee's father Stephen (pictured with her sister Alyssa) has said she cannot go without her insulin for five days and has never spent time away from her son before
