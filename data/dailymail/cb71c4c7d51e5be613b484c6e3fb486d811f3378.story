Barely a quarter of Tory voters think David Cameron is in touch with ordinary people, according to a damning poll of public attitudes towards the Prime Minister.

Just 28 per cent of voters who backed the Conservatives in 2010 think Mr Cameron understands the lives of normal people.

But among all voters the figure falls to just 14 per cent, with the only positive for the PM being 44 per cent of people think he gets up earlier than other party leaders.

Prime Minister David Cameron is seen as the least in touch leader, but most likely to get up early

Labour’s poll lead over the Tories has narrowed in recent weeks, with Mr Cameron buoyed by strong economic growth and the positive reaction to the Budget.

However attempts to appear to be in tune with working class voters have backfired, most notably with an advert claiming drinking beer and playing bingo is what ‘they’ like to do.

The new YouGov/BuzzFeed survey shows how far the Prime Minister has to go to reassure voters that he understands their lives.

Among 1,900 people surveyed, just 14 per cent thought Mr Cameron was ‘in touch with normal people’, compared to Ed Miliband on 31 per cent and Ukip leader Nigel Farage on 30 per cent.

Even Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg out-polled Mr Cameron on 16 per cent.

Among all voters only 14 per cent of people think Mr Cameron is in touch, less than half those who say the same of Labour's Ed Miliband and Ukip's Nigel Farage

Most voters think Mr Cameron gets up earliest, but back Mr Farage in a fight

Among people who voted for the Conservatives at the last general election, only 28 per cent said Mr Cameron is in touch, falling to 9 per cent among 2010 Lib Dem voters and 7 per cent with people who voted Labour last time round.

Mr Farage fares much better with his own party. Despite being a privately-educated former stockbroker, 77 per cent of people who plan to back Ukip say he is in touch.

The Tories have been gripped by the threat posed by Ukip, promising an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union and tougher measures to tackle immigration.

This week Mr Farage and Mr Clegg will go head-to-head in their second live TV debate on Europe.

Fight! The poll also asked voters who would win a fight, with Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right) expected to triumph over Lib Dem Nick Clegg (left) and Labour's Ed Miliband (centre)

The latest YouGov poll for the Sunday Times puts Labour 7 points ahead of the Tories

A snap poll after their first confrontation last week found that 57 per cent thought the Ukip leader had performed better, with 36 per cent backing the Deputy Prime Minister.

During the debate Mr Farage defended employing his wife using public money, insisting: ‘I very much doubt that anybody else in British politics has worked the hours and had so little fun as me over the course of the last few years.’

But voters actually think he is most likely to have a lie-in.

Just 4 per cent of people think he is the party leader who gets up earliest in the day, compared to 44 per cent for Mr Cameron, 12 per cent for Mr Miliband and 6 per cent for Mr Clegg.

However, 25 per cent of voters think Mr Farage would win a fight between the party leaders.

Mr Cameron can also take comfort from the fact he is the party leaders most voters would like to sit next to on a long journey (26 per cent), is most likely to have a greatest legacy (34 per cent) and likely to leave the biggest tip (24 per cent).
