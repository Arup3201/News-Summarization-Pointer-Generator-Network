Gareth Bale will be moved into a new central midfield role as Carlo Ancelotti attempts to find a winning formula his new team of galacticos.

Bale has been playing as part of a front three alongside Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo since his world record transfer from Tottenham last summer. 

But the introduction of Colombian star James Rodriguez this season could see the Welshman moved deeper to play alongside Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, according to Spanish paper Marca.

Real problems: Gareth Bale will drop deeper to add balance while Cristiano Ronaldo has had to backtrack

Real Madrid have started this season slowly, a Spanish super-cup defeat to city rivals Atletico followed by an unconvincing victory over newly promoted Cordoba and a shock loss against Real Sociedad. 

There has been criticism over the sale of Angel Di Maria to Manchester United and despite assembling the most expensive squad in the history of football, Real have struggled to find the form that saw them crowned European Champions last season.

However, Ancelotti hopes that moving Bale into the role occupied by Di Maria last season he will strengthen the midfield and find a balance.

Elsewhere in Spain AS lead on the story of Ronaldo's dispute with Real Madrid's president Florentino Perez.

The World Player of the Year had been quoted criticising the club, but now says his words were misunderstood and he is fully supportive of Perez in a move AS describe as 'breaking and going into reverse'. 

'My comments have been misinterpreted. Yesterday I heard what my President had to say and I am with him 100 per cent'.

In Italy the front pages are occupied with two stories focused around champions Juventus. 

La Gazetta Sportiva leads with 'A clash between Italy and Juve', after defender Giorgio Chiellini pulled out of the Italian squad with an injury. 

Old Lady: Chiellini's withdrawal and Trezeguet's comments are the big stories in the Italian press this week

Corriere dello Sport takes the same line with the headline 'Blue Sparks'. 

Italy team manager Gabriele Oriali questioned if the club were acting against the national team's best interests but Juventus have insisted that they always collaborate with the Azzurri.

Tuttosport splash on the comments of Juve legend David Trezeguet, who says his former club should be concentrating on the Champions League this season.

Juve have won the Scudetto three years in a row but failed to make a significant impression in Europe.
