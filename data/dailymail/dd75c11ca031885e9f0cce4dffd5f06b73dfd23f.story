A suicidal man who jumped from an 11th-floor flat killed a five-year-old girl on the pavement below when he landed on her.

The 39-year-old man died instantly after he jumped from an apartment in the south-eastern port city of Busan in South Korea.

The girl, who had been walking with both her parents outside the building, died later in hospital from brain damage and multiple broken bones.

A police official said it remained unclear why the man decided to jump. Witnesses saw him preparing to leap but he did not appear to have left a suicide note behind.

South Korea has the highest suicide rate among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with an average of nearly 50 deaths a day.

The man, only identified as Mr Jang, is said to have jumped from his flat  on Wednesday evening.

In what is being reported as a suicide, Mr Jang hit his neighbour’s daughter as she emerged from the apartment building, SBS TV reports.

The girl, who was with her father at the time of the incident, was taken to hospital but pronounced dead soon after arrival.

Mr Jang died immediately at the scene.

Mr Jang had long been treated for mental illness and depression before the accident, SBS quoted an area police official as saying.
