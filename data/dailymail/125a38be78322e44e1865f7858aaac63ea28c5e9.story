President Nicolas Maduro has been accused of shifting the blame for remarks which suggest the double murder of two Britons was inspired by a soap opera

The murders of a man and his beauty queen wife in Venezuela were the result of soap operas which 'glamorise' violence, the country's president has said.

President Nicolas Maduro claimed the deaths of Thomas Berry and Monica Spear Mootz could have been inspired by 'telenovelas' which feature themes of drugs, violence and crime.

Critics have slammed the president's remarks, suggesting he is trying to distract from the real cause of crime in Venezuela which has the fifth highest murder rate in the world.

President Maduro highlighted one programme in particular which features a psychopathic former beauty queen who poisons her mother.

His comments come after pressure on authorities to crackdown on violent crime was heightened following the couple's deaths.

Thomas Berry and Monica Spear Mootz were killed in cold blood after being robbed when their car broke down on the Puerto-Cabello to Valencia highway on Monday

Their five-year-old daughter who was also in the car, was shot in the leg.

Police have made five arrests in connection with the case, including those of two minors. 

Anti-violence groups have estimated that the homicide rate is as high at 79 deaths per 100,000 people, but the government – which hides official crime statistics – claims it's 39 per 100,000, reports ninemsn.com..

The president has previously cited video games and superheroes as causes for crime in the South American country.

Thomas Berry and Monica Spear Mootz were attacked by armed men who approached their car as they waited for a repair truck.

The terrified couple locked themselves in their 
Toyota Corolla. But the robbers opened fire through the windows.

Nightmare: A friend of Berry said he had spoken to him on Sunday and was told they were having a great time

The bodies of Mr Berry and Ms Spear, who had American citizenship, were found in the car with their daughter, who had been shot in the leg.

Their five-year-old, believed to be called Maya, was taken to hospital where family and friends are helping to care for her.

According to Telemundo, the car was already on the back of a tow truck at the time of the attack. Two tow truck drivers who had arrived to help the couple are said to be under 'intense interrogation' by police.

All the tires on the couple's car had been punctured after it hit 'a sharp object that had been placed on the highway', director of investigative police, Jose Gregorio Sierralta, said.

At least six shots are believed to have been fired, hitting Mr Berry in the chest, his ex-wife in several places and their daughter in the leg.

The attack appeared to follow a pattern of recent robberies, where cars are disabled by obstacles left in roads, or drain covers removed. A photo believed to be the couple's car was pictured behind police tape by Gilbert Angustia on Twitter.

Ms Spear was a famous TV actress following her pageant victory and appeared in a number of telenovelas [South American soap operas], with her roll in 'Forbidden Passions' the most notable.

Police believe the couple may have been targeted by bandits who put obstacles in the road to force victims to stop.

The ploy is commonly used on the country's highways after dark.

Venezuela is one the most violent places in Latin America and armed robberies, carjackings and kidnappings are rife.

The annual murder rate in Caracas alone is an average of 80 murders per 100,000 people, the third highest in the world.

Most
 murders occur in the slums where police presence is minimal. Eastern 
Caracas is home to South America’s largest slum, named Petare with more 
than two million residents, where the police to public ratio is 1 
officer to every 3,000 people.

There
 were an estimated 24,000 murders in 2013, one of the world’s highest 
homicide rates. It has tripled in the previous decade.

Gun ownership is also high, with an estimated 15 million unlicensed weapons in circulation.

The University of Central Florida graduate had American citizenship and her parents live in Orlando, Florida.

Pictures of the model enjoying the vacation with her young daughter were posted on Ms Spear's Instagram account in the days leading up to her death.

In a short video posted on the day she was shot dead, the actress blows a kiss to the camera during a horse riding trip.

Another photo shows Ms Spear holding hands with a girl, believed to be her daughter, as they gaze across a lagoon.

Her ex-husband, who described himself as an 
independent travel consultant in an online profile, lived in the capital
 Caracas, reports El Universal.

He moved to Florida for a short time after he was shot 15 years ago in a robbery that killed his friend.

'He had already been shot once by robbers trying to steal his car,' close friend Luis Dominguez told The Telegraph.

'His friend died in the incident and although doctors saved his life, they couldn't extract the bullet and he still had it in his stomach.'

['Mr Berry] moved to the States to get
 away from things here for a while but missed Venezuela and came back,' 
Mr Dominguez added.

It 
is understood Mr Berry and his wife had separated last year, but were 
still close friends and holidayed together for the sake of their 
daughter.

Better times: Some friends thought that they were going to announce that they were back together after the January vacation (seen at their wedding in 2008, the same year that their daughter was born)

His parents are at the hospital with the couple's daughter. It is not known if his sister, Katie, who lives in Scotland, will fly out to be with the family.

Ms Spear's parents were flown from Florida to Venezuela by private jet, provided by Venezuela's president, so they could be with their granddaughter.

'It is the deepest pain, the deepest pain. It is unbelievable,' her father, Rafael, told the Orlando Sentinel. 'She was very charismatic, a very good daughter, a very good mother, and she loved Venezuela.'

He recalled how his daughter had come to him for advice when she wanted to change from her chemical engineering course to study acting instead.

'I told her she had to decide what she wanted to do to be happy for the rest of her life,' he said. 'When my children were young, I wouldn't let them watch telenovelas, and then she began acting in soap operas, and I began watching all of hers.'

Mr Dominguez, who ran an adventure tour company with the actress's ex-husband, told NBC he last spoke to Mr Berry on Sunday. 'They were having the greatest time. He said, I'll see you soon,' Mr Dominguez said.

A friend of the family, Carlos Drakkar, 38, a Colombian graphic designer who lives in Caracas, said: 'This is a very difficult moment for all of us to deal with. We are doing all we can to help out friends in this difficult moment. These things happen all too often in this country. Something has to change.'

Loving: Former Miss Venezuela Monica Spear Mootz and Thomas Berry had maintained a good relationship following their divorce and family say they were close to getting back together for the sake of Maya

Ms Spear's family had asked her to move to the U.S. with them after she was robbed six times, but the model refused.

Her brother, Ricardo Spear Mootz, said: 'She loved her country too much. It was her home.'

Family friend Marytza Sanz said Miss Spear loved Venezuela and even though she could have remained in the U.S. she chose to return so her daughter could spend time there.

The network Miss Spear worked for released a statement describing her as a 'great actress' who had 'extraordinary drive and determination'.

Venezuela's public prosecutor has appointed two separate investigators to the case, while the CICPC, Venezuela's SWAT police force unit, has been deployed to nearby slums for answers.

Commissioner Daniel Alvarez , head of the CICPC's homicide division, promised 'fast results in this awful case'.

The Foreign Office says it is aware of the reports and are looking into it with the assistance of its offices in Venezuela.

A
 spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British 
national on 6 January in Venezuela. We stand ready to provide consular 
assistance to the family.'
