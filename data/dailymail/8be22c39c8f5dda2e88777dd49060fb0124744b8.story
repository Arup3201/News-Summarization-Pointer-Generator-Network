Age need be no barrier to success. At either end of the spectrum. Scotland’s women – well, one woman, one girl – demonstrated the inadequacy of a birth certificate as a judge of anyone’s athletic ability on another rousing night at Tollcross.

First para sport swimmer Erraid Davies, already the youngest competitor in Team Scotland history, became the youngest ever competitor – from any nation – to win a Commonwealth Games medal when she produced a storming comeback to take bronze in her 100m breaststroke race.

Then Hannah Miley, already a gold medallist from the 400m individual medley and all but on her knees after swimming in a gruelling 800m freestyle heat earlier in the day, proved all of the ageist doubters wrong to claim a shock bronze in the 200m individual medley.

What a star: Scotland's Erraid Davies, 13, holds her bronze medal on the podium after the 100m breaststroke SB9 final. Already the youngest athlete ever to represent Scotland, Erraid became the youngest competitor from any nation to win a Commonwealth Games medal

Glorious moment: Davies smiles as she realised she's won the bronze medal at the end of the 100m race at the Tollcross Swimming Centre

Miley, at the grand old age of 24 written off by some as too old and too slow to even hang on to the 400 IM title she’d won in Delhi, spent the build-up to her race cheering on 13-year-old – yes, that’s right, 13 – Davies to a medal.

Then the Team Scotland medal machine turned in a powerhouse performance of her own, making a mockery of the theory that swimmers cannot possibly peak beyond a certain age.

‘At 24 years of age, I’m still swimming PBs,’ said the diminutive Miley. ‘A lot of people thought I was too old, I wouldn’t do it, I should be dropped and forgotten about.

‘I might be small but I definitely don’t want to be forgotten about. That’s been a big motivating factor. Age is just a number. It’s about the heart and determination in the athlete.

‘For me, I want to prove people wrong – and show a way that you don’t have to stop by 21, 22. Look at some of the world-class swimmers out there showing you can get past the age of 24 and still swim personal bests. Now I’m one of them.

‘Who knows how long I will go on for? Until I stop loving swimming. I’ve got the Olympics in Rio on my horizon and I try taking each block by two years. After that I will have to try and organise a bit of a life.

‘It’s just a matter of how much you want it. Some of us in British swimming think we get told we are past it and our time at the top is finished.

‘To be honest it is up to the athlete themselves to try and change that. For me, being told my time at the top is over doesn’t mean anything. It is only over when I say it.’

It was a first medal for the teenager and she made history by becoming the youngest ever medallist at a Commonwealth Games

That attitude propelled Miley to a fine performance in an event that is far from her favourite, coming back from seventh at the end of the butterfly length to pinch third at the finish.

She told Sportsmail: ‘To be honest, I thought the 400 IM was my only shot and that was it. I am very surprised to get a bronze. As you can tell from the grin on my face, I’m happy with that.

‘I’m almost as happy with that as I was with the gold in the 400. And the fourth place in the 200 breast stroke. It’s just been an amazing meet.

‘It’s all about the race and getting stuck in. I thought I would maybe get fourth or fifth place so to go better than that and come away with some hardware is pretty special.

‘Consider that, in Delhi, I only came away with one medal – and I was super proud of that. To come away with two is an added bonus. 

Home favourite: Miley reacts with delight after discovering she has won the bronze medal in the 200m Individual medley

‘The 800 free earlier, I died! I was in so much pain! Now I’ve got to do it all over again tomorrow night

‘I’m just taking every race as an opportunity to swim fast, get into finals and get PBs. That was my goal after day one.

‘I’m in the best shape of my life, so I’m trying to take advantage of that. That shows with the times I’m getting. How will I top this? I’ve no idea.’

If Miley was pleased for her own sake, watching Davies come back to get a medal of her own proved another highlight, the ‘veteran’ saying:  ‘That really inspired me. 

‘I was just wanting her to get into a medal position and I am so chuffed for her.

‘I went into my own race with a big grin on my face knowing she had done that. She is such a wee cutie - and it is nice for her to come to her first Commonwealth Games and get a medal.’

A stunned and smiling Davies, roared on to the podium and cheered every inch of the way as she joined her fellow medallists on a lap of honour, said: ‘I feel really, really happy. I didn’t think there was any chance of the medal, although I knew there was a slight chance. I started getting excited during the race.

Power: Miley had competed in an 800m freestyle heat earlier in the day but fought off the fatigue to claim bronze in the 200m individual medley

‘My mum and dad are here and I gave my mum a hug. It’s different being a youngster. I am inspired by my team mates.

‘I’ve looked up to Hannah for a while and it’s being good being here and being able to talk to all the more experienced athletes.

‘I will take my medal to school and show my friends. It has been a bit weird but I feel really happy.

‘The medal ceremony was really good. I didn’t know I was the youngest ever medal winner in the Commonwealth Games . That is amazing.

‘It was strange when the rest of the team made the guard of honour for me but a great feeling.’
