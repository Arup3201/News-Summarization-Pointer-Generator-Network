Prize-money hungry players are ‘creating havoc’ by repeatedly challenging umpires and line judges, a Wimbledon grandee claimed yesterday.

Alan Little, who has run the Wimbledon library for 37-years, said players were better behaved in previous generations when the financial incentives for winning were far less.

‘Generally they were sportsmen [in the past] – they were doing it for pleasure, although that didn’t mean to say they didn’t try.

‘I think generally players are pretty behaved here', he told the Telegraph.

‘[But] you get the odd one.

'The money is obviously the temptation because they need to win. In the old days, people just relaxed and played. It has all tensed up now. They’ve got to win.

‘Years ago, the players would normally accept what the umpire said – not always, but generally.

‘It was in or out. I’m not saying they never disputed it, but not to the point where they would create havoc.’

The winners of this year’s singles competition will pocket £1,760,000 and even first round losers picket up £27,000.

Fognini of Italy complains about a decision to the match official during his Gentlemen's Singles second round match against Tim Puetz of Germany

When tennis turned professional in 1968, the champion won just £2,000 - the equivalent of £30,000 today.

Last week an Italian tennis player was yesterday hit with the largest ever Wimbledon fine- after telling an umpire he had too much gel in his hair.

Self-confessed ‘hothead’ Fabio Fognini was ordered to pay £16,000 following an outburst during his first-round match against U.S player Alex Kuznetsov.

He told ground supervisor Wayne McKewen - in Italian - that he wanted to break his racquet on his head, after he was warned about throwing it.

Italian witnesses alleged he then told umpire James Keothavong: ‘When you get up in the morning, all you think about is putting gel in your hair’.
