John O’Shea now has one hundred caps and three goals for the Republic of Ireland.

As Martin O’Neill and his team edge forwards towards an unlikely shot at qualification for the European Championship finals, that second statistic is currently somewhat more important than the first.

Only seconds remained in added time in Gelsenkirchen on Tuesday night as Ireland seemed to be heading to a rather expected and routine defeat against a German team unimpressive but still markedly superior.

Toni Kroos had scored his team’s goal with 20 minutes to go and, for Ireland, there seemed to be no coming back.

O’Shea, however, had been a Trojan at centre-half all night and, when it mattered, he appeared just an inch or two ahead of Germany’s Mats Hummels to prod an unlikely equaliser past Manuel Neuer after a deep cross from substitute Wes Hoolahan had been hooked back across goal deep in the 94th minute.

It really was a most incredible finish. O’Shea’s last goal for his country had come against Kazakhstan. Suffice to say, this one may transpire to be much more important.

Having not lost back-to-back competitive games since the European Championship finals hosted by Holland and Belgium 14 years ago, Germany were clearly intent making amends for their setback across the Polish border at the weekend.

For much of the first half, their football was purposeful and aggressive. For long periods, though, there was not much to show for it once play reached the environs of the Irish penalty area. 

Indeed, Irish goalkeeper Forde was worked only twice in an opening 45 minutes that saw O’Neill’s team hold the Germans at bay with relative comfort.

Certainly Ireland were organised and not lacking in energy themselves. O’Shea and Marc Wilson were particularly impressive immediately in front of Forde even if the Irish largely failed to hold on to the ball whenever they did manage to venture in to the German half.

A team unrecognisable in part to the one that lifted the World Cup in Rio back in early July, Germany nevertheless bristled with attacking menace at the outset. 

Indeed, only five minutes had elapsed when left-back Erik Durm advanced to smack a superb right foot volley in to the top of the crossbar from 25 yards.

For a while this effort seemed to set the tone as the German midfield eased the Irish defence so far towards their own goal that, at times, as many as six green shirts retreated to form some kind of shield in front of Forde.

There were other early chances, too, as full-back Antonio Rudiger headed a good chance wide after a training ground set piece between Kroos and Thomas Muller provided him with an opportunity. 

Then Julian Draxler made an intelligent run inside David Meyler to receive possession and pull the ball back to Kroos. The shot, though, was dragged wide.

Irish forays in to German territory were rare but, as time passed, so were genuine threats on their goal. 

Mistakes from Wilson and then Forde gave Germany an apparent route to goal but O’Shea cleared with a huge swing of the right boot that said everything about the urgency of the situation.

Before the interval there was still time for Ginter to head a corner over while Kroos also whistled another long range effort over the frame of the goal. 

Germany, though, reached half-time with much to think about and made a change for the second period as Arsenal’s Lukas Podolski replaced Ginter for the second period.

At the start of the second-half, Ireland briefly threatened as James McClean crossed low to the near post forcing German goalkeeper Neuer to be sure of his handling as Robbie Keane looked to profit from any uncertainty six yards from goal.

Before long, however, Germany were back on top and Forde was at his best to touch over a long-range shot from Kroos before Hummels almost turned in the resulting corner from close range.

Just before the hour, meanwhile, came a moment of apparent controversy as Podolski appeared to be fouled in the penalty area by Wilson after Muller had superbly cushioned a header in to the substitute’s path. 

However, replays showed that the referee was correct to wave away penalty appeals as there had been no contact and Podolski had in fact fallen over rather easily.

By now, with less than half an hour left, Ireland were beginning to look rather ragged. They just couldn’t keep the ball and, as such, were beginning to look increasingly vulnerable. Germany, though, were still looking less than convincing.

Having had a more realistic penalty appeal rejected when O’Shea seemed to grapple Gotze to the ground, Germany finally broke through in the 70th minute.

Kroos had already had a few sighters when he lined up another from 25 yards and this time his low right foot shot fizzed past Forde and found the corner via the foot of the goalkeeper’s right-hand post.

Right at the death, Ireland almost scored when McClean crossed low from the left for Hoolahan, only for Durm somehow to throw himself in the way of the ball and block the threat. Then up stepped O’Shea to write his own story.

‘I remember all my international goals because there aren’t many,’ said the former Manchester United player. ‘This one overtakes the other two. I’m not one for hanging shirts up but this one may be heading for the mantelpiece in my mum and dad’s house.’ 

The result leaves Ireland with seven points from three games in Group D, with the hardest away trip out of the way for O'Neill and assistant Roy Keane.
