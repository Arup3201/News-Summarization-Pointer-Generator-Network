David Gale, 51 (pictured outside an earlier court hearing), set up bank accounts and online Betfair accounts in the name of his ex-wife before swindling cash of friends, family and his partner

A fraudster who swindled nearly £2million from his in-laws, friends and new partner in a Ponzi-style sports betting scheme which funded his gambling addiction, luxury holidays and mortgage, has been jailed for seven years.

David Gale, 51, set up bank accounts and online Betfair accounts in the name of his ex-wife Faye and convinced her father and grandfather to part with their cash for the 'scheme'.

The 51-year-old financial adviser, from Chichester, West Sussex, promised investors he had found a 'magic formula', which would guarantee huge, risk-free profits if they signed up.

However, he instead conned them out of hundreds of thousands of pounds including his father-in-law who lost £145,000, his grandfather-in-law who lost £2,000 and his new partner who was swindled out of £800,000.

In total, he used his trusted position as a member of the family or as financial adviser to trick over 30 people into handing money in the so-called 'foolproof' online football betting scheme between 2008 and 2011.

Instead of investing the money as promised, he withdrew the cash immediately, splurging it on home refurbishments, holidays, shopping and fine wines.

His spending included £31,000 to pay off his mortgage, £7,000 for school fees, £15,000 for home improvements, £31,000 on leisure activities and holidays, £46,000 on shopping and £8,000 on fine wines.

During the swindle, he declared he had no income on his tax returns.

Wearing a grey shirt and a beige blazer, he showed no emotion in the dock as he was sentenced at Guildford Crown Court to six years for fraud charges and one year for unauthorised regulated activity, to run consecutively, on Friday.

Sentencing him, Judge Christopher Critchlow said: 'The type and nature are extremely serious fraud offences breaching the trust of family and friends.

'I've been told it's all to do with your gambling.

'Those involved have been affected to a lesser and greater degree by your fraud and complete dishonesty.

'Beverley Rutland said you've completely destroyed her life.

'Mirren Mace said: "What you've done so brazenly and dishonestly is hard to come to terms with".'

The court heard how his ex-wife's grandfather Maurice Mitford was one of the first investors to sign up to the scheme, losing £2,000, while her father Philip Landreth lost £145,000, forcing him out of his retirement and back into full-time employment to try and make ends meet.

In total, Gale lost £1.8million of the £2.3million pounds given to him to 'invest' securely by nine friends and family members, frittering it away betting on sports, dog and horse racing and traditional casino events.

He withdrew some funds to pay 'dividends' to his investors to fool them into thinking the collective investment scheme was profitable and had his then-wife and a new partner fooled too, the court heard.

Mrs Gale previously told how she was 'swept off her feet' when she met her husband, who is 13 years her senior, at Royal Ascot in 2004.

The seven-year marriage ended when his scheming, implicating her, was uncovered in 2011, and the pair remain separated but not yet divorced.

He immediately left the family home in Great Bookham, Surrey, where the couple lived with their two children and moved to Little London in Chichester, West Sussex.

Mrs Gale, 37, previously appeared in the dock alongside her former husband, charged with aiding and abetting him, but Judge Robert Fraser told her this would lie on file.

She was described as 'completely innocent' regarding what her husband was up to, saying her ex-partner's explanations of his fail-safe betting system was 'all Greek' to her.

Her ex-husband had complete access to her finances, opening bank accounts in her name to which she never had access, the court heard.

The mother of two said she had been duped just like the investors, had never used the Betfair gambling site herself and didn't even know the passwords to the accounts. 

Mr Gale convinced his investors to part with more cash by telling them he had been offered Betfair shares at a preferential rate because he was such a good customer. 

Prosecuting, Alison Clare said: 'It was simply a complete and utter fiction. 

'He told people he had discovered a 'magic formula. Of course, there was no secret formula.'

When his spending caught up with him and the ruse became untenable in March 2011, Gale sent an email to many of his investors saying a 'disastrous sequence of events,' meant he had lost all their money by pressing a 'wrong button' on the computer while betting.

The conman then said the only way he would be able to win back their money would be if they invested a further £100,000 in a new fund, which he promised would give 100 per cent returns.

Most of his victims began to fear they had been defrauded on a monumental scale, but incredibly some continued to give persuasive Gale their money - including 71-year-old Christine Burnett, who had been introduced to Gale through his father.

The lonely and vulnerable woman became close to Gale after her husband died in November 2008, leaving her with property and significant finances. She was said to have felt sorry for Gale for losing his money and his wife.

The pair started a romantic relationship, during which time Gale invested over £800,000 of her money and set up Betfair accounts in her name, as he had done previously under his ex-wife's name.

Some £665,000 of this money was lost through gambling and theft, leaving elderly Mrs Burnett 'knocked for six,' with debts, a shattered credit rating, and her family without an inheritance.

'Looking back, Mr Gale must have thought I was sitting on a fortune,' she said.

Friend Beverley Rutland invested £390,000 and lost £260,000 to Gale, while Keith Durston invested £65,000 and lost £51,000.

Defending, John Dye said a repentant Gale had a 'long-standing' gambling problem for which he had been receiving treatment during his three years on bail.

'He now knows it (the betting scheme) was wholly optimistic and was always doomed to fail,' he said.

'The problem with gamblers is they bury their head in the sand trying to chase their losses to try and make a profit.'

At an earlier hearing Mrs Gale was found liable for hundreds of thousands of pounds when family friend, Kathleen O'Neill sued for the £300,000 she had invested in the Ponzi-style scheme.

Last March, Judge David Donaldson QC cleared the London-based TV producer of any dishonesty but ruled that she would still have to cover the costs of Mr Gale's losses in her name.

She took it to the Court of Appeal in December but three top judges ruled against her. 

Mr Gale was handed down a six-year jail sentence for fraud and one year for unauthorised regulated activity for carrying out financial activity while banned, to run consecutively.

Judge Critchlow gave him jail time for each of the 34 charges, with other sentences ranging from eighteen months to six years to run concurrently.

A Financial Reporting Order was made for ten years and confiscation proceedings will be started to see if any money can be won back for the victims of the betting scam.
