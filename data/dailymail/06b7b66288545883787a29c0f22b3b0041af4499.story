As supermodel who has posed naked numerous times, Kate Moss is well positioned to judge when too much flesh is unacceptable.

The catwalk super star has given out fashion advice to British females by urging them to stop flashing so much skin during summer.

The 38-year-old thinks that Britons do not how to dress properly when the sun comes out because they are not used to it.

Speaking to Grazia magazine she said: 'When you're driving down the road in the summer, the English people... It's not our natural thing, no. So it's 'put it awaaaaaay!'

Cutting-edge couple: The supermodel, pictured last night wearing a sheer black dress and matching nail polish, thinks British women dress badly in summer because they aren't used to the heat

Despite her stark warning, Kate has 
revealed that her guitarist husband Jamie Hince 'would go mental if she 
dressed like a wife'.

The 
couple live together in north London with Kate's nine-year-old daughter 
Lila, from her relationship with Jefferson Hack, but they are still a 
long way from boring.

Kate admitted that 43-year-old Jamie, one half of band The Kills with Alison Mosshart, 'likes me when I'm a rock 'n' roll kind of girl'.

Kate certainly has the credentials - having dated wayward Libertines star Pete Doherty and found notoriety for her reported wild partying.

She has frequently been the subject of controversy - particularly since many have claimed her drinking, smoking and late nights have begun to ravage her looks - but her laidback attitude suggests she does not care.

Bedtime: Kate looked a little worse for wear as her husband followed her out of the club

Despite her claim that there are 'things she can't wear' as she has grown older, she could not pinpoint something that she would say 'never' to, she told Grazia magazine during a rare interview.

But she admitted that she would trust her husband to speak up if she 'went a bit far', insisting, 'My husband's pretty good. He is.'

The two were married in a glamorous, A-list wedding last July and have recently got a dog, causing some fashion headaches for Kate, because 'you can't walk a dog in a heel. You look ridiculous.'

The model, who has branched out with her Topshop range and recently judged Mango's fashion awards, said she tries to be 'a character' when she gets dressed.

'I don't think of it as "Ooh, it's me",' she explains. 'I think, "Who do I want to be?".'

She claims to have some limits however, admitting that she draws the line at clothes that are too short, show too much flesh or have too much colour.

The Croydon-born star says that her worst wardrobe malfunctions involve forgetting to do up zips - and indeed she was seen out in London leaving Mexican restaurant La Bodega Negra last month with her flies undone.

Although she says she 'loves' people trying out the looks she has designed for Topshop and copying her style, she says her one piece of fashion advice to the British public would be to be aware of exposing too much in the summertime.

She said: 'When you're driving down the road in the summer, the English people...

'It's not our natural thing, no. So it's "put it awaaaaaay!".'

But clearly her love affair with fashion will not be disappearing for some time to come.

Asked if she has ever denied herself a purchase, she replies, 'Definitely not.

'There's always room. Always.'
