When Facebook suggested to Ellenora Fulk that she should befriend Teri Wyatt-O'Neill, she recognised someone in the other woman's profile picture.

Even though Ms Fulk did not know Ms O'Neill, she noticed a picture of the stranger drinking champagne with her estranged husband - dressed in formal clothes and standing next to a wedding cake.

When she confronted her husband, Alan O'Neill, he admitted that he had married Ms O'Neill despite having never divorced Ms Fulk.

O'Neill - who formerly called himself Alan Fulk - now faces bigamy charges in Tacoma, Washington after Ms Fulk alerted authorities to his deception.

According to charging documents filed on Thursday, he married Ms Fulk in 2001, moved out in 2009, changed his name and remarried without divorcing her.

Ms Fulk first noticed O'Neill had moved on to another woman when Facebook suggested the friendship connection to Ms O'Neill under the 'People You May Know' feature.

'Wife number 1 went to wife number 2's page and saw a picture of her and her husband with a wedding cake,' Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist said.

Ms Fulk then called the defendant's mother.

'An hour later the defendant arrived at [Ms Fulk's] apartment, and she asked him several times if they were divorced,' court records show.

'The defendant said, "No, we are still married."'

Neither O'Neill nor Ms Fulk had filed for divorce, according to charging documents. The name change came in December, and later that month he married Ms O'Neill.

O'Neill allegedly asked Ms Fulk not to tell anybody about his dual marriages and promised he would fix it, the documents state.

But she alerted authorities anyway.

'Facebook is now some place where people discover things about each other that end up reporting that to law enforcement,' Mr Lindquist said.

O'Neill was previously known as Alan Fulk. He has worked as a Pierce County corrections officer for five years, sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said.

He was placed on administrative leave after prosecutors charged him on Thursday. He could face up to a year in jail if convicted.

O'Neill is free, but due in court later this month, which is standard procedure for non-violent crimes.

'About the only danger he would pose is marrying a third woman,' Mr Lindquist said.
