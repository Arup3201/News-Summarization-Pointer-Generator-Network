A California-based trade group for the adult film industry has lifted a moratorium on production spurred by a feared HIV exposure on an out-of-state film set.

The Free Speech Coalition (FSC) ended the five-day production hold Monday, saying in a statement that testing has been completed and 'the performer pool has not been compromised.' 

The group first called for a three-day moratorium that was extended through the weekend.

The group said in the statement 'A production hold was called when it was determined that a performer in the PASS [Performer Availability Screening Services] database might have been exposed to HIV in late September, after off-set contact with a performer from an out-of-state set that was not observing PASS protocols. 

'We called a production hold while we conducted precautionary testing with that performer and anyone he or she performed with. All precautionary testing has been completed and there is a medical determination that the performer pool has not been compromised.' 

The organization didn't name the state where the film set was located.

The group's head Diane Duke said she knows the lack of information provided in such cases is frustrating, but medical privacy is essential for performers.

Though there was another production moratorium in August, the adult performer tested did not have the virus, the FSC said at the time.
