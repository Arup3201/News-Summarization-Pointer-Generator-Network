Hundreds of President Obama supporters were today left frustrated and disappointed after a computer glitch denied them any chance of attending the inaugural ball that was open to the public.

Tickets for the black tie event at Washington Convention Center on January 21 were scheduled to go on sale on Monday morning.

Then a technical mistake by distributor Ticketmaster meant that all available entries were snapped up on Sunday night, before they were even meant to be on sale.

Guilty conscience: Ticketmaster emailed some customers to say that they had 'inadvertently' put ball tickets on sale a day early

Ticketmaster emailed everyone who had registered an interest on Sunday, telling them that at some point on Monday they would receive a unique link.

This would allow them to enter the 'first-come, first served' contest to buy a maximum of two tickets at $60 each.

On Sunday night, however, Ticketmaster mistakenly sent out the link to the purchase page and began selling tickets.

Ticketmaster later sent a follow-up email confessing to the problem. 'During testing of our email system tonight, you may have inadvertently received an invitation to purchase tickets for 2013 Inauguration events, including the Inaugural Ball or the Inaugural Parade,' read the message.

'Public tickets to these events were originally scheduled to go on sale tomorrow morning - you received the email tonight in error, and Ticketmaster takes responsibility for this mistake.'

The note continued: 'A significant number of public tickets were purchased this evening, despite the early email. Ticketmaster will be in touch with any additional information.'

Then came the crunch: 'All tickets are first-come, first-served including those sold tonight. There is no guarantee that you will be able to purchase a ticket at any time.'

Customers that tried to login at this point were shown a count of zero tickets on the system. And those who tried to buy tickets in the morning were told that they were no longer available.Â 

Some registered customers got all the emails, some received a mixture, while others got nothing at all.

Many were left frustrated by the episode, feeling cheated that they hadn't had a fair chance of purchasing tickets.

June M. Jeffries, a retired assistant U.S. attorney, told the Washington Post: 'I stayed up four hours doing this.'

She
added that Ticketmaster and the Presidential Inaugural Committee should
void the all sales and start again to ensure a fair process.

The request to start again was echoed many times on the  Presidential Inaugural Committee Facebook page, where hundreds of users vented their frustration.

Many
people were angry with the circumstances and a perceived lack of 
official recognition. Other users expressed annoyance with Ticketmaster 
and doubts that the company should ever have been trusted with the ball 
tickets in the first place.

More
suspicious customers felt sure that the chance to attend the ball had 
been fixed, to only allow access to chosen and well-connected members of
the public.
