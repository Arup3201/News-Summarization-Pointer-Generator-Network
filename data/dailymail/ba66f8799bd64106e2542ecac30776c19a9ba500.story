Millions had already come to marvel at the spectacle of the Tower of London poppies.

And yesterday tens of thousands more were drawn to the memorial as the capital fell silent in remembrance.

As bells rang out at 11am, the vast crowd stood hushed before the hundreds of thousands of ceramic poppies – one for every British and colonial death during the Great War.

A ripple of applause marked the end of the two-minute silence, and five friends paid a very personal tribute to their own war dead.

Serving soldiers Tony Davies and Brian Smith joined retired colleagues Matt Pope, Ross Harrison and Bradley White to uncork a bottle of vintage port in a toast to nine comrades killed in Afghanistan in 2007, and hailed them as heroes.

Mr White, 28, who served as a private in the 1st Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment, said the Tower of London commemoration recalled the ‘scale of the sacrifice’ of an earlier generation of soldiers. 

He served in both Iraq and Afghanistan until 2007, when he was shot in the left leg during a Taliban ambush, destroying his calf muscle.

Support: Veterans praised the public for showing their backing of the military and the losses endured in the name of war

He said: ‘It is the first time I have come to London for Remembrance Day, so it is poignant to remember all those who died serving their country.

‘I saw the poppies a few weeks ago. Seeing it all finished now just shows the scale of the sacrifice. It is quite emotional when you look at the sheer scale of it.

‘When we were out in Afghanistan we lost nine soldiers, and numerous more since. So it does bring back poignant memories from when we were out there.’

The 1st Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment endured a particularly bloody deployment to Helmand in 2007, which was described as some of the toughest fighting the British Army had faced in a generation.

Ceramic poppies at the Tower of London, which have been sold to members of the public for £25. Buyers are being warned not to put them outside until spring because they may crack in extremely cold weather

The installation of over 888,000 red ceramic poppies was created by artist Paul Cummins, each poppy representing a British or colonial fatality during World War One

Also planting poppies were Chelsea Pensioner Albert Willis, 79, an ex Grenadier Guard alongside a Tower of London Yeoman Warder and a serving Grenadier Guard 

Mr Harrison, who served in the same battalion, said: ‘This is for nine heroes, Chris Gray, Darren Bonner, George Davey, Captain David Hicks MC, Robert Foster, John Thrumble, Aaron McClure, Tony Rawson and Alex Hawkins.’

The poppy installation at the Tower is due to be completed tomorrow on Armistice Day as the final ceramic flowers are planted in the moat, bringing the total to 888,246. 

The artwork – the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red – has proved so popular, with an estimated four million visitors, that there have been calls to keep the poppies at the Tower until the end of the year.

Volunteers will start dismantling the artwork on Wednesday, but a section, the wave of poppies, will remain in place until the end of the month. 

Floodlights have been installed to allow more people to visit after dusk after overwhelming crowds closed the nearby tube station 

The Weeping Window, a section of the piece with flowers pouring out of one of the tower's historic windows, will remain until December

The poignant tribute is among many pieces of artwork produced to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the beginning of WWI

This part and the so-called weeping window will also be installed at sites across the UK until 2018 and will eventually go on permanent display at the Imperial War Museum.

In a sign of solidarity, a former German paratrooper laid a wreath of remembrance at a village church yesterday.

Adam Druschel, 95, saw action across Europe while serving with the crack 1st Parachute Regiment in the Second World War.

The one-time unteroffizier was eventually captured by the Americans at Mons, Belgium, in September 1944, and ended up as a prisoner of war in Britain.

He joined his English-born wife, Constance, 84, at St John the Evangelist Church in Lund, near Preston, Lancashire, to honour the fallen of both world wars.

‘It is sad to think that World War One began a century ago,’ he said. ‘I wanted to be here to remember all those who died, of all nationalities.’

The Queen and Prince Phillip visited the artwork in October. Volunteers have been adding to the piece since it was unveiled in August

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge toured the sea of poppies in August with Prince William in one of the first official visits to the site
