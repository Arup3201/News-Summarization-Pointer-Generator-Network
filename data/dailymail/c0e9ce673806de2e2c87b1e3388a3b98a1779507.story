A teacher with breast cancer was shocked after her coworkers gave her their sick days, which totaled nearly the length of the school year.

Carol Clark told KABC 'It's indescribable.'

The affiliate station reported that the Jaime Esclante Elementary School teacher was only able teach for two months last school year.

Teacher: Carol Clark, who has breast cancer, ran out of sick days - but her coworkers stepped in and offered their own to her 

'I started out with the cancer, and then the chemotherapy, and then things got really good and I thought, "OK, I beat it, I'm good." And then things went downhill again,' she told KABC.

The affiliate station reported that when the cancer returned 'Clark had to use her vacation days, plus 120 sick days she had accrued during her 17 years with [Los Angeles Unified School District]' and she still needed more sick days.

'I lost pay, I lost my medical benefits, all that stuff,' Clark told KABC.

To compensate, fellow teachers employed the Catastrophic Illness Donation Program after Clark's husband suggested it, the affiliate station reported.

Husband: Fellow teachers employed the Catastrophic Illness Donation Program after Clark's husband Dave suggested it, giving Carol 154 sick days 

Battle: The Jaime Esclante Elementary School teacher was only able teach for two months last school year because of her illness 

Her husband and fellow teacher Dave Clark told KABC 'We get paid for 180 days in the school year. So she got 154, so almost a whole year.'

'Some of the people that donated money, I didn't even know. They were friends of friends of mine,' Carol said.

'When you run out of all of your sick paid leave…if you run out, you [can] lose your health benefits and your income,' LAUSD's Gayle Pollard-Telly told ABC News.

The news site reported 'there have been at least two other donation drives where more than 150 days were raised for a teacher.'
