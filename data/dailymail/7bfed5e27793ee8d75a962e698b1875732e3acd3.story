Sufism is a branch of Islam that traces many of its principles from the prophet Muhammad through his cousin and son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib.

Sufis believe that they are practising ihsan (perfection of worship) as revealed by the Archangel Gabriel to Muhammad: ‘Worship and serve Allah as you are seeing Him and while you see Him not yet truly He sees you’. Sufis consider themselves as the original true proponents of this pure original form of Islam.Unlike other branches of Islam Sufis have devotion to particular saints, a concept other strands of Islam do not really recognise.

Sufis practise mortification of the flesh as way of showing their devotion to their saints such as can be seen here: swords in eyeballs, pierced cheeks and skewers in their backs.

One small boy whimpers with a skewer through his cheeks while an older man is held by his friends as he, too, is skewered. A third man has hooks put into his back and then he is hoisted by a crane and driven through the streets.

The men with the skewers in their cheeks dance along in the procession.
