With their shocking gangland violence and drive-by shootings, the Grand Theft Auto computer games have earned their reputation as gritty recreations of the dark underbelly of American city life.

They are a million miles from the bucolic charms of Cornwall â€“ but now a hilarious video imagines how the bestselling series might play out in Englandâ€™s south-west.

The spoof, called 'Grand Theft Cornwall', shows one of the Grand Theft Auto V's anti-hero protagonists on a mission to hunt down pasties.

Grand Theft Cornwall: The spoof video combines clips from the game itself with a voiceover from comedian Colin Leggo, 35, the man behind a string of Cornish-themed viral videos, to hilarious effect

He wanders through the familiar environment of the best-selling game, but instead of spraying bullets and stealing cars he talks to strangers in a West Country accent and moans about parking.

He's seen walking into a shop and asks for a steak pasty and a can of Fanta - before hurriedly leaving when the proprietor tries to sell him a gun.

But violence isn't far away, with him battering to the ground one adversary for daring to insult the good name of South West-based retailer Trago and another for preferring another pasty maker over Falmouth's Tickle Yer Tastebuds.

Realising that he might find himself in trouble with the police, he decides to leave the county and go on the run, perhaps to Scotland.

But at the last minute he has second thoughts and the video ends with the hero leaping off a bridge rather than leaving Cornwall, yelling 'I can't live up country!'.

The four-minute spoof combines clips from the game itself with a voiceover from comedian Colin Leggo, 35, the man behind a string of Cornish-themed viral videos.

His latest effort - subtitled 'if GTA was set in our beloved county' - has already been viewed more than 92,000 times on YouTube (warning: explicit language).

Mr Leggo's video comes on the heels of warnings that children as young as six have been copying rape scenes and swear words from the smash hit Rockstar North title.

Mr Leggo, a writer and comedy club boss, from Budock Water, Cornwall, said: 'A mate lent me a copy of the game and I just found it overly violent.

'I started amusing myself with comedy accents and having a little fun with it and the video just evolved from there.

'I'm satirising the violence in a way because the game is so ridiculous you may as well make it look even more ridiculous by introducing a pasty shop.'
