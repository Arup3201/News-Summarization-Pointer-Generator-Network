Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has left Cardiff City by mutual consent, bringing an end to a hugely underwhelming eight-month spell at the club for the Norwegian.

The final straw, on the back of last season's relegation, was Tuesday's 1-0 home defeat against Middlesbrough, which left Cardiff 17th in the Championship.

Solskjaer was called to London on Wednesday morning for lengthy talks with chairman Mehmet Dalman who, on the instruction of absent owner Vincent Tan, opened discussions on terms for the 41-year-old's exit.

During the course of those conversations, it was put to Solskjaer that the club wanted to head in a new direction, with the former Manchester United striker admitting on Thursday: 'Our difference in philosophy on how to manage the club made me decide to step aside.'

A prominent club source is adamant that Tan and other senior figures were not seeking to influence team selection.

Solskjaer's exit comes on the same day Dundee said their manager Paul Hartley, Cardiff's leading target, was staying at the club. And Tony Pulis, who was attending an event at one of Tan's hotels in Malaysia, also indicated to a TV reporter that he would prefer a job in the Premier League. He added that he has not been approached by Cardiff.

Solskjaer said: 'I want to thank Vincent for giving me the opportunity to manage Cardiff City FC. He has my full respect and I really wish him all the best in his pursuit of making this football club successful.

'However, our difference in philosophy on how to manage the club made me decide to step aside and allow the club to move forward in the direction Vincent wants.

'I leave the club with some very talented players and want to thank them for their efforts and hope to see them challenge for promotion this season. I also want to thank Mehmet Dalman for his continued and loyal support and feel I have gained a new friend.' 

Cardiff want to appoint Dundee manager Paul Hartley as the new boss, but the Scottish club are resisting

The club confirmed that Danny Gabbidon, who returned to the club as a player-coach this month, will join academy coach Scott Young in preparing the side for this weekend's trip to Derby. 

Tan added: 'Ole was hired by Cardiff City on our understanding and belief that he would help us fight relegation from the Premier League. Unfortunately that did not happen. After the club was relegated many people advised me to let him go, but I decided to keep Ole on for the Championship season. Regrettably our recent results do not justify Ole's continued role as manager at Cardiff.

'Ole has therefore decided to step down and I have accepted this. During my short association with Ole, I have found him to be an honest and hard-working professional, but unfortunately the football results were not in his favour.

'As long as I am the owner of this club, Ole and his family will always be welcome in the Chairman's Suite as my guests. I wish Ole the very best in his future career in football. We now begin the process of finding his replacement and working towards giving all our stakeholders in Cardiff City the results they deserve.'

A senior source at the club told Sportsmail that relations between Solskjaer and the club's hierarchy remained 'amicable', but added that serious doubts were raised after Cardiff threw away a 2-0 lead in the 4-2 defeat against Norwich on Saturday.

Dalman said: 'Having spoken with Ole on deciding the best course of action for all parties, I'm sorry to say that we have agreed that it is in the best interest of the club for us to go our separate ways.

'Ole has been a wonderful professional to work with since his arrival at the club. Due to a difference in philosophy of approach to the game, we have decided to part company amicably. He and his family will always be welcome at Cardiff City. I know I have gained a good friend whom I wish well and remain confident in his future success.' 

There are some at the club who are keen on giving the manager's job to former player Craig Bellamy 

Contact is said to have been made with Hartley, with several prominent Cardiff sources claiming he was the leading candidate.

But Dundee released a statement on Thursday – before the Cardiff release confirming Solskjaer's departure – that insisted Hartley has 'long-term plans' to stay at the club.

It read: 'The club would like to confirm that manager Paul Hartley has long term plans to stay at Dundee Football Club.

'Paul is committed to the club and is looking forward and focused on the upcoming derby matches this week.

'As a club, we are not surprised that speculation linking Paul to other clubs has come up due to the fantastic job he continues to do at Dens Park.

'The club and Paul see the solid foundation which has already been put in place as the beginning of a long term plan which will see Paul at the helm of the club for years to come.'

Tony Pulis, meanwhile, is currently unlikely to step down to the Championship, but he has admirers at the club. Glenn Roeder was pictured in the directors' box on Tuesday, though he is not currently thought to be a managerial candidate, while there are also elements of the club who favour Craig Bellamy's return. The decision will be largely down to Tan.

Despite the club's relegation as the Premier League's bottom-placed club – Cardiff were 17th when Malky Mackay was sacked - Tan was determined to stick with Solskjaer, though it was made clear that promotion in this campaign was the only acceptable target.

Instead, Cardiff have plummeted after a promising start and are currently winless in their past four Championship games. In all, Cardiff have won only five of their 25 league matches under Solskjaer.

The poor results come in spite of vast investment in the squad, with Tan having spent roughly £16m on 17 new players since Solskjaer took over. Dalman was also permitted to sign off on one of the division's biggest wage bills.

But Solskjaer has consistently given off the impression that he does not know his best line-up or formation, having kept an unchanged side only once in league fixtures – a factor that is believed to be behind the 'philosophy' differences.

Further to that, Solskjaer's promise of attacking football, which was so alluring to Tan, has not materialised, with only eight goals scored in the league this season.

Cardiff City Supporters' Trust chairman, Tim Hartley believes that the new manager needs to quickly inject some energy into the club.

He said: 'Given the team’s performances on the field this season, it was inevitable that the manager’s position would come under scrutiny.

'What is needed now is a new manager who can energise the players and take the club up the Championship table.

'The next appointment of a manager will be crucial. The club must get the decision spot on because there is need for stability and renewed success at the football club.

'Chairman, Mehmet Dalman, cites a "difference in philosophy" of approach to football in his statement. The departure of Ole again flags up the need for the club to have some recognised footballing knowledge and experience in the boardroom to ensure we get and then keep a manager who knows his football and can push forward for promotion. We wish Ole all the best for the future.'
