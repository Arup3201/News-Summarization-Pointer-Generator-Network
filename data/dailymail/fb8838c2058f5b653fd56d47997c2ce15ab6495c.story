Wrestling legend Jake 'The Snake' Roberts was all but ready to give up on life when three years ago a friend pulled him from the brink.

By the time Roberts' former protege Diamond Dallas Page, the founder of DDP Yoga, tracked down the 59-year-old Hall of Famer, Roberts hit rock bottom with drug and alcohol addiction, and as far as he was concerned, there was no way out for him.

'I had given up on life completely; I was just waiting to die. I was praying it would happen soon,' Roberts recalls in a new documentary The Resurrection of Jake The Snake Roberts, which tells the story of how, against overwhelming odds, the former WWF celebrity was able to turn his life around.

True to life: A new documentary The Resurrection of Jake The Snake Roberts, which premiered in Utah in January, tells the story of how the former WWF celebrity was able to turn his life around

The film, created by Roberts' friend Page and director Steve Yu, premiered last month at the Slamdance Film Festival in Utah.

Speaking to ABC News about his three-year struggle to overcome addiction, Roberts said his dependence on alcohol, pills and crack cocaine had made him feel worthless and alone in the world.

'I’ve been to jail and rehab, I’ve never heard anybody say "When I was younger, my dream was to become an addict or alcoholic,"' Roberts said in the interview last month. 'It’s not something anyone wants for themselves.'

Roberts, born Aurelian Smith, had the deck stacked against him from the outset. The son of a teenage mother who became pregnant with him at age 12 and famed wrestler Grizzly Smith, the future Hall of Famer suffered severe trauma as a child, including domestic abuse and the kidnapping and murder of his sister.

Roberts embarked on his wrestling career in 1974 in Louisiana. A little over a decade later, he made his debut with the World Wrestling Federation, which remained his home, on and off, until 1997 when he was fired.

He continued taking part in championships and bouts until 2011, when Roberts announced his retirement from the sport.

Nothing fake about that: Diamond Dallas Page, Roberts' one-time wrestling protege-turned-yoga guru, said that most people think that what they do in the ring is fake, but in fact, it takes a very really physical toll on the performers 

That same year, Jake Roberts was the odds-on favorite to be the next retired wrestler to die, according to Diamond Dallas Page, himself a former WWF star who knew firsthand how physically and mentally taxing the brutal sport can be.

'When you look at football players, hockey players and wrestlers, we take the most beating out of any of them, because we do it 270 nights a year,' Page explained. 'It was brutal and you don’t realize it when you are living the dream.'

He added: 'As for people who say wrestling is fake, you can’t fake gravity. We are out there putting on a show. We are rock 'n' roll stuntmen gladiators.'

The Snake's savior: By the time Page, the founder of DDP yoga, tracked down Roberts in 2011, the retired WWF star was on the brink of death from drug addiction, alcoholism and obesity  

By the time they retire after spending years being thrashed about in the ring for the entertainment of millions, many wrestlers come out the other side feeling broken and lost because they don't know how to do anything else.

As their life begins to crumble, often compounded by martial or financial problems, that is when addiction comes into play, Page said.

That was the bleak reality Jake 'The Snake' Roberts, the one-time charismatic, python-flinging star of WWF and the inventor of the notorious DDT wrestling maneuver, found himself when he hung up his dukes.

When in 2011 Dallas Page decided to track down his old mentor, the two had not spoken for five years.

'The only reason I was a three-time champion, was because of what Jake Roberts taught me. I always wanted to repay him,' Page explained.

The former wrestler-turned-founder of a specialized yoga program assumed that Roberts was clean. Nothing could prepare Page for the sight of a 300-lbs pill-popping, crack-smoking alcoholic who answered the door.

‘My father was an alcoholic, who finally stopped drinking in his 70s,’ Page said. ‘Jake’s a great guy, he just made a lot of bad decisions. I saw so much of my dad in him.’

Diamond Dallas Page turned out to be uniquely qualified to help Roberts. His yoga program is tailored to help former wrestlers and military veterans get back on their feet with a special fitness routine and healthy diet.

Grueling work: It took Roberts (pictured in Atlanta in May 2013) three years of dieting and exercise to get his life back on track by restoring his health 

For Page, the first order of business was to change Roberts' diet by replacing junk food with wholesome organic meals so he could 'feel alive again.'

The next step was to put Roberts on a workout regimen to begin rebuilding his battered body. Page even moved Roberts into his home in Atlanta so he could keep him on track at all times.

At first, the 59-year-old grossly overweight former wrestler could hardly get through five minutes of exercise without wheezing and screaming in pain. But little by little, he began regaining his strength.

'I can remember when I lost the first 10 pounds, because it was so long since I had a victory under my name,' Roberts recalled with pride to ABC.

After three years of grueling work on his body and mind - a process punctuated by setbacks, shouting matches with Page and a bout with cancer - Roberts emerged sober and 80lbs lighter.

‘I’m feeling better than I’ve felt in 25 years. Not just mentally but physically,' he said. 'The things that I’ve regained are endless – friends, family and work relationships.’

New lease on life: Now 80lbs lighter and sober, Roberts (left) says he's been able to reconnect with his children and grandchildren, and he is now excited to live 

Once estranged from his children because of his many demons, the twice-divorced WWF legend has found his way back into their lives. This past Christmas, he got to spend time with his brood, including his 10 grandkids.

Jake Roberts said the biggest change for him was that now he was able to dream again and wake up feeling excited to live.

The former wrestler also has found a new calling in life at age 59 - helping others like him by inspiring them to make a change.

‘The real treasure is when a guy walks up to you with his daughter, wife and son, and begins thanking me "for giving them all back to me,”’ Roberts said.
