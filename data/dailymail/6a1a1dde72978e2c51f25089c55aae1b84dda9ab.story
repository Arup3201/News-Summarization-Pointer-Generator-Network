Roy Keane is prepared to call a truce with Alex Ferguson — providing his former manager apologises for ‘bad mouthing’ the Cork man after he left Manchester United.

In an interview to be published with FourFourTwo magazine today, the former Old Trafford captain insists he would have no problem sitting down for a cup of tea with the Scot, so long as he acknowledged the disparaging remarks made in the aftermath of his acrimonious departure from the club in 2005.

Asked whether he would ever meet up with Ferguson and go for a pint, Keane replied: ‘Well, it would be a cup of tea. If Sir Alex apologises, then yes, I would.

‘If Ferguson apologises I would be happy to move on… for Ferguson to bad mouth me after I left, I think he does owe me an apology.’

The Republic of Ireland assistant manager, who left his No 2 role at Aston Villa last week, admitted there was a clash of identical personalities with his manager towards the end of his time at United.

‘Yes. It was never going to end as a pal’s act. I was never going to leave with champagne and flowers,’ he continued. ‘I saw how Bryan Robson and Steve Bruce left the club, both decent United captains, and I didn’t like the way they left.’

And Keane remains defiant in his stance since his departure, making his feelings perfectly clear to supporters who feel his legacy was tarnished by his final days at the club.

‘If United fans say I had a decent career then brilliant. If they want to say, “What’s gone on with Ferguson stuff?” then f*** them.’
