Dr Kari Saastomoinen outside Poplar Coroner's court

A Finnish doctor who used a test banned in 2005 to check whether a feeding tube had been wrongly inserted into an 84-year-old woman has been cleared of any negligence.

An inquest into Andriana Georgiou's death found the feeding tube, which was mistakenly placed in her lungs, did contribute to her death on 15 December, 2012.

But senior coroner Mary Elizabeth Hassell did not find Dr Kari Saastamoinen guilty of gross negligence - even though he used a whoosh test that was banned in Homerton hospital in east London seven years ago following three patient alerts.

Giving a narrative conclusion, the coroner said: 'Mrs Georgiou was an elderly lady and she clearly had some very significant natural disease.

'Having listened very, very carefully to all the evidence, I am persuaded that the misplacement of the naso-gastric tube was a contributing factor. 

'I am always going to look at the systems in a situation like this. The systems here weren't perfect, but I do think that the systems were good.

'Having really considered the matter, I am not going to write a report which aims to prevent future death.

'The misplacement of the tube was not detected because of individual error. 

'I am satisfied on the balance of probablities the misplacement of the tube caused death, but I am not sure on that. Because I can't be sure, I can't return a verdict of unlawful killing.

'In order to find gross negligence, I must say the conduct was so bad that it was criminal and I don't find that.'

The inquest at Poplar Coroners Court 
heard Mrs Georgiou, who was born in 1928 in Cyprus and was a retired 
machine operator, died as a combination of a stroke and the misplacement
 of the tube.

The medical cause of death given was pneumonia. 

The coroner continued: 'Andriana 
Georgiou died from a combination of natural disease and the consequence 
of a misplaced naso-gastric tube.

'The tube was placed and she tested 
as having a PH over eight. The senior nurse asked the consultant for an X
 ray but he chose to do a whoosh test. He was satisfied it was in the 
right place, it was not.

'There was a patient alert in 2005 
and two subsequent alerts directed the practise of using a whoosh test 
to detect the position of a naso-gastric tube must cease immediately. 
The trust found any patient with a PH over five must have a chest X ray.

'Dr Saastamoinen was in contravention
 of the firm advice of a senior nurse, in contravention patient safety 
alerts dating back seven years, and in contravention of the hospital 
trust's clear policy.

'When the misplacement of the tube 
was discovered, nearly two litres of fluid was aspirated. The 
misplacement caused Mrs Georgiou great distress.'

Dr Kari Saastamoinen was asked by a 
senior nurse at the Homerton University Hospital to carry out a chest 
X-ray after a PH test on the feeding tube showed an abnormal amount.

But
 the consultant carried out a whoosh test on Andriana Georgiou, which 
involves pumping air down a tube and listening for bubbles using a 
stethoscope.

The 
grandmother and retired machinist, who suffered from diabetes and 
dementia, died 11 days later on December 15, 2012, from aspiration 
pneumonia at the east London hospital.

Giving
 evidence at Poplar Coroners' Court, Dr Saastamoinen claims he was never
 shown hospital policy when he started in 2010, and says the whoosh test
 is commonly used in Finland where medicine is 'more informal.'

But
 the inquest heard Dr Saastamoinen did not even attend an induction at 
Homerton because he was working at Royal London at the same time and 
timing was 'difficult'.

He only completed the induction last year.

He added: 'I learnt the whoosh test in medical school in 1993. I started medicine in 1993 and worked in Finland until 2010.

'It is a very different system, it is very informal in Finland.'

The inquest heard how Dr Saastamoinen
 was 'reluctant' to do a chest X-ray because there could be a 24-hour 
delay in feeding Mrs Georgiou as the hospital 'doesn't prioritise X-rays
 for feeding tubes.'

Dr Saastamoinen, who is still working
 full time at the hospital, then showed junior doctors how to carry out 
the 'rarely used' test as he was not aware it has been discredited.

He said: 'I showed them the test because it is something they have never seen because it is so rarely used.

'It's not taught anymore because it is technical and complex.

'I said there is another way of checking the tube and if you do it properly, it is reliable. I said it is not normally done.

'If [I knew] it wasn't recommended, I wouldn't have taught students it.

'For me, it sounded clear and the tube was in the right place and feeding had started.'

He continued: 'I accept now it was hospital policy at the time for a chest X-ray. I never saw the trust policy for the tubes. I didn't know how to access trust policies.

'I didn't know the whoosh test had been discredited.

The misplaced feeding tube had been a 'contributory factor' in her death, the hearing was told

'[At the time] I thought it was appropriate because I have vast experience and never had any complications.

'Presented with the same decision tomorrow, I wouldn't do the test. I would do the X-ray.'

Dr Sasstamoinen also admitted he thought it was 'likely' Mrs Georgiou's health deteriorated as a result of the misplaced tube.

Sisphiwe Raseluna, a senior staff 
nurse at the Homerton University Hospital in Hackney, east London, said 
Dr Saastamoinen had carried out the 'whoosh test' in front of junior 
doctors on Mrs Georgio. 

'He
 did say to the junior doctors that it was not recommended, but he still
 felt that the whoosh test was reliable,' Nurse Raseluna told the 
inquest.

She said the
 test dated back to the 'olden days' and it was trust policy to carry 
out an X-ray where a test to show whether a feeding tube had been 
correctly inserted showed a litmus reading on a patient of over five.

In the case of Mrs Georgiou, she said her reading had been eight.

Senior coroner Mary Elizabeth Hassell did not find Dr Kari Saastamoinen guilty of gross negligence at Poplar Coroner's Court

'I
 asked Dr Saastamoinen was he going to have an X-ray or not, he said to 
me "no" because he was happy the tube was in place and he wanted the 
patient to be fed as soon as possible,' Ms Raseluna told the inquest.

But addressing the inquest Dr Saastamoinen denied having said the whoosh test was 'not recommended.' 

'I said there is another way of checking the position of an naso-gastric tube and if you do it properly, it is reliable. I said it is not normally done,' he said.

He said he had learned the 'whoosh test' at medical school in Finland and had used it on several occasions in that country without problems.

He added that if Nurse Raseluna had informed him that it was trust policy to send a patient for an X-ray in these circumstances he would have complied.

The inquest also heard evidence from 
Dr Andrea Lehmann, who argued against the post mortem result, which 
found the misplaced tube was a contributing factor to Mrs Georgiou's 
death.

The stroke consultant at Homerton 
said: 'Events from the next day would all fit. It would explain the 
chest pain and so on but the tube was subsequently removed and there is a
 gap of 11 days of the placement of the tube and when the patient passes
 away.

'I was a little surprised over the conclusion of the pathologist. I 
don't feel there is enough evidence to say it caused Mrs Georgiou's 
demise.'

She continued: 'I don't think the tube was a corroborating factor to the death.'

Mrs Georgiou was admitted to the hospital after suffering a stroke and 
had been plagued by ill health long before her death - including being 
at risk 'every day' of pneumonia, the inquest heard.

Earlier, the inquest heard from staff nurse Veronica Dadzie who reinserted the feeding tube on December 4, 2012, after it had come out of Mrs Georgiou. 

She said she had contacted Nurse Raseluna to alert her of the litmus reading and asked for her to request a chest X-ray to find out whether the tube was correctly positioned.

Dr John White, a specialist clinical negligence lawyer acting for Mrs Georgiou’s family, said they wanted answers as to how such a 'never event' could have happened.

Mrs Georgiou lived with her daughter and granddaughter in Tottenham, north London.

'Feeding a patient down a tube misplaced into the lungs is a so-called "never event" which means an event that the NHS says it has resolved to prevent ever from occurring by having proper precautions in place,' he said.

'Yet such an event has happened here. Quite understandably, the family are looking for answers as to how this could happen and lead to Mrs Georgiou’s death.'

Medical director at the hospital Dr John Coakley passed his wishes on to
 the family: 'She was distressed over being admitted to an intensive 
care unit, which is a horrible experience for anyone.

'In relatives, I have seen on the ICU, it is a state of post traumatic 
stress disorder - it is that level of stress.'Irrespective, this 
incident clearly had an impact. It led to admission in ICU and was 
associated with her death.

'All the family understood her life expectancy was limited but this is something they felt very bad about.'

Dr Coakley assured the coroner steps have been at the hospital - 
including documents on feeding tubes - since Mrs Georgiou's death.
