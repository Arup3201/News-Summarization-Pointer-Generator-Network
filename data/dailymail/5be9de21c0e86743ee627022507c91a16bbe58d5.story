A convicted robber has sparked outrage after posting photos of himself on Facebook posing with fellow inmates in his jail cell.

Adam Ali is just nine months into a seven year sentence for his part in a robbery on a cash-change truck at a motorway service station where the van driver was taken hostage. 

But last month, the 34-year-old was seen posting pictures of himself and fellow inmates from his cell at Featherstone Prison in Wolverhampton- where the use of mobile phones and social networking sites are banned.

Jail bosses are now investigating the Facebook uploads, which were removed within hours of being made aware of the pictures.

The brazen pictures show the smiling father-of-six, dressed smartly in a grey shirt, posing with his fellow convicts. Ali even made one of the images his profile picture. 

His posts also attracted plenty of comments from his 384 friends with one saying: 'Looks like a nice flat you got there. Is it one or two bedroom, make sure you lock the front door of a night. I've heard it's a bit rough in that area, full of criminals.'

But the status updates have landed the convict in deep trouble.

A spokesman for the Prison Service said: 'It is totally unacceptable for prisoners to access social networking sites or instruct others to do so on their behalf.

'If a prisoner breaks the rules they can be stripped of their privileges, have time added on to their sentence and may be reported to the police for further action. Facebook will close down accounts being updated by, or on behalf of, serving prisoners.'

The Ministry of Justice department also confirmed it had asked Facebook to remove the pictures of the prisoner and his profile.

Ali, from  Great Barr, Birmingham, was jailed last June for the robbery on the cash exchange truck. 

The van had been carrying £465,000 to Staffordshire's V Festival in August 2013 when Ali and his accomplices targeted the driver when he stopped at a Hopwood Service Station on the M42.

Dressed in hoods and ski masks the gang took the driver hostage, bundling him into a high-powered Audi, while Ali drove the vehicle to a field near Alvechurch, where he was due to meet his accomplices.

The Government announced that phone networks could soon be compelled to block mobile phones and SIM cards being used in prisons in a proposed amendment to the Serious Crime Bill.

If approved, the legislation will mean that, once a phone has been identified, the prison service will be able to apply to a court for it to be disconnected without needing to seize the phone or prove it is being used by a specific prisoner.

In 2013, a total of 7,451 seizures was made of illicit mobile phones or SIM cards in prisons.

Ali was jailed at Worcester Crown alongside with Leon Bell, 37, of Sheldon, and John Wall, 50, of Washwood Heath. All pleaded guilty. Bell was jailed for eight years and Wall was given seven.

A fourth man, Leon Brown, 38, Hall Green, was convicted of robbery last year and jailed for 13 years.

The court heard that the gang followed the low-profile cash-change truck from a depot in Oxford.

Bell and Brown, wearing hoods and ski masks, grabbed the driver at the service station. Wall was to meet them in Alvechurch but was picked up by police while driving there in a van.

The rest of the gang then diverted to Alvechurch railway station where the terrified cash delivery driver was forced to help empty the money from his van before being locked inside.

The three were arrested after a high-speed chase involving the Audi. 

His brazen posts had even attracted comments from some his 384 friends who jokingly complimented Ali on his 'nice flat'
