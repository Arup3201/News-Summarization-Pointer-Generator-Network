Children should not drink rice milk because it can contain harmful levels of arsenic, scientists have warned.

The poison is found naturally in low levels in rice and other plants.

Levels can be boosted by the way rice is grown in flooded paddies and by the presence of traces of old pesticides.

Rice bran, from which rice milk is made, carries higher levels than raw polished white rice.

The NHS already advises parents not to feed rice milk – often used by those who are lactose-intolerant – to under-fives.

Now the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) has extended this to older children.

Its report calls for arsenic levels to be regulated in products used by children. Currently arsenic content of foods is not regulated. No ‘safe’ level of exposure can be identified.

The report says: ‘The risk from consumption of products made from rice bran, such as rice drinks, is much higher than from raw – but polished – white rice.’

As well as being a poison, arsenic is linked to the development of some forms of cancer.

Dr Iva Hojsak, of University Children's Hospital Zagreb in Croatia, who led the commentary, said: 'Inorganic arsenic is considered a first level carcinogen and its long-term exposure has negative effects on human health.'

Because of its availability, nutritional value and relatively low allergenic potential, rice is a widely used carbohydrate during weaning.

Rice and rice products such as starch, flour and syrup are commonly added to infant foods and drinks.

The report said: 'That contributes to high exposure of infants and young children to inorganic arsenic which is two to three times higher than in adults.'

ESPGHAN says rice-based formulas 'are an option' for infants allergic to cow's milk but their arsenic content should be declared and considered by doctors and parents.

Otherwise the organisation recommends avoiding rice drinks for infants and young children and including a variety of other grains in their diets such as oats, barley, wheat and corn.

It also calls for further research on the inorganic arsenic content of rice and other foods and its lifelong impact on health.
