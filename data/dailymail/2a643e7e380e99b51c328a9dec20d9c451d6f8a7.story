They say a good book is timeless.

But you'll have to rush to get the most out of these incredible tomes.

Carved out of ice, the 250-pound blocks tell stories of the earth using leaves, seeds and dirt to raise awareness about the rapidly melting glaciers and our need to save them.

Story time: This sculpture left on a river bank in Alberquerque was carved from frozen river water and laced with seeds in a bid to emphasize the need to save the rapidly melting glaciers

Tales of the earth: The books are placed on the earth to melt and regenerate banks hit by drought

Ecological artist Basia Irland, from Albuquerque, carves the books out of frozen river water.

She then laces them with seeds - then leaves them on the bank side to melt and repopulate the land.

The project, entitled Ice Receding/Books Reseeding, has been rolled out across America using fauna from each local region.

Project: Basia Irland (right) spends days carving each 250lb block, which is then released into the water

Unique: Each tome in communities across America is unique as it uses fauna from the local river banks

Crystallized: This book, entitled River Oats Volume Two, uses Chasmanthium latifolium from Dayton, Ohio

Mountainous: Restoration Text uses Cottonwood Populus Freemonii from Rio Grande in New Mexico

A Canadian story: Red maple was used to design this sculpture for children near Ottawa River

And it will be used in school curricula to teach schoolchildren about biodiversity. 

Ms Irland explains: 'Ice Receding/Books Reseeding emphasises the necessity of communal effort, artistic insight, and scientific knowledge to deal with the complex issues of climate disruption and watershed restoration by releasing seed-laden ephemeral ice sculptures into rivers.' 

'When an ecosystem is restored and the plants grow along the riverbanks, they help sequester carbon, mitigate floods and drought.

Keen readers: These students waded through the water in Ottawa River to read the Columbine flower book

Nature at its finest: The summer project sees the books glisten in golden light before drifting into the water

'They pollinate other plants, disperse seeds, hold the banks in place (slowing erosion), create soil regeneration and preservation, act as filters for pollutants and debris, supply leaf-litter (for food and habitat), promote aesthetic pleasure, and provide shelter/shade for riverside organisms including humans.'

Irland works with stream ecologists, biologists, and botanists to ascertain the best seeds for each specific riparian zone.
