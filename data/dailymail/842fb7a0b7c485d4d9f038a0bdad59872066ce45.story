Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. It's a saying that'll be ringing in Queens Park Rangers co-owner Tony Fernandes' ears all summer.

The multi-millionaire businessman is due to head into a strategy meeting this week as the club starts preparing for their return to the top-flight.

The futures of their current players will be top of the agenda, but their summer recruitment policy will not be far behind.

Changes: QPR manager Harry Redknapp knows he has work to do to keep his club in the Premier League

 

But anyone expecting another money-going-out-of-fashion style spending spree at Loftus Road are likely to be disappointed.

Fernandes claims he is wiser after having his fingers burnt during the club's previous Premier League tenure.

High transfer fees and high wages spent on the likes of Loic Remy, Park Ji-sung, Julio Cesar and Chris Samba did not work out as planned.

Not only that, it has left the club facing a staggering £50million fine for breaching Football League Financial Fair Play regulations.

The prospect of such hefty punishment alone will ensure the club are more prudent this summer.

Experience: With around 750 club and international appearances Rio Ferdinand would be a high-profile signing

Indeed, sources at Rangers insist the club are keen to stress the days of extravagant spending on high-profile stars are over.

The way player contracts are structured is under review, with the club keen to move away from paying high basic salaries; instead moving towards incentive-based deals.

QPR officials feel that will help them avoid players who are intent on using Fernandes' riches as a vehicle to earn a quick quid.

Such an approach is likely to prove problematic when trying to attract top-level stars to Loftus Road this summer but it is an approach the club are willing to take to ensure they do not sign players who only want a ride on the money train.

Manager Harry Redknapp knows he'll need to add some Premier League know-how to his ranks this summer.

Fulham midfielder Scott Parker is on Redknapp's radar and out-of-contract stars Joe Cole and Rio Ferdinand could also be targeted.

At first glance, QPR would be falling into the same old traps by targeting those three former England players.

But the trio have worked under Redknapp before; developing close relationships with the 67-year-old in the process.

Gifted: Young talent Ravel Morrison has impressed whilst on loan and could move permanently

Rangers are also considering turning Ravel Morrison's loan deal permanent ahead of next season.

Despite not featuring at Wembley on Saturday, there's a willingness to complete a full-time move for the 21-year-old midfielder, who has 12 months left on his West Ham contract.

Morrison fits the profile of player Rangers would prefer to target this summer: young, talented and with something to prove.

Toon: French striker Loic Remy is unlikely to return to QPR after his loan spell at Newcastle

Before pressing ahead with those moves, Redknapp must decide on which players he wants to keep at the club.

Big-earners such as Shaun Wright-Phillips, Jermaine Jenas, Bobby Zamora, Stephane Mbia and Andy Johnson are all out of contract this summer.

Likewise, players like Remy, Esteban Granero and Adel Taarabt are all due to return to Loftus Road following loan spells away.

Remy is set to leave this summer, while Granero and Taarabt are unlikely to feature in Redknapp's plans for next season.

There are plenty of questions. We're about to find out the answers.
