But it wasn’t a foul-mouthed hoodie that so intimidated the Tesco  workers – but a church-going grandmother of four.

Christine Crow, 83, was banned for life from her local branch after bosses claimed she was a ‘bully’ who had rammed staff with her trolley.

Grandmother Christine Crow wants an apology from Tesco for 'humiliating' her after they accused her of bullying their employees

Mrs Crow, a widow, was banned after she was frog-marched from the store by security staff.

They claimed that following an 
incident at the deli counter months earlier she had been verbally and 
physically abusive on subsequent visits and had used a trolley ‘as a 
weapon’ and intimidated staff.

It is understood she is accused of targeting one employee on more than one occasion.

Mrs Crow, who lives in the Birmingham suburb of Moseley, a mile from the store in Hall Green, denied the accusations and is now demanding an apology. She has complained about being snubbed by staff and humiliated.

But Tesco is standing by its decision with one worker, who asked not to be named, claiming a colleague refused to go on the shopfloor while the pensioner was there.

The pensioner was ushered from the premises by two managers and a security guard

'It's a trumped-up charge,' protested Christine last night. 'Bullying? You must be joking.

'Admittedly, the trolleys can have a mind of their own. You bump into someone else's and apologise, but 'ramming' suggests a deliberate act.'

The drama unfolded at the deli counter of the Stratford Road store months ago when Christine, originally from Yorkshire, spoke out over slow service.

She admits being 'sharp'. 'I may have said, "is there no one serving?".

'I've served customers myself,' said the former school meals supervisor. 'You don't always like the customer, but you get on with it.'

Relations between Christine and staff soured following that skirmish, though she denies berating workers or attacking them with her trolley.

She was informed of the ban in December - when she was ushered from the store.

'It was very humiliating,' she told the Birmingham Mail.

'When they said I'd been banned for bullying staff, I replied, "you must be joking.".

'People were walking past with eyebrows raised. They thought I was a shoplifter.'

Christine had used the store for 15 years but is now getting her groceries from Waitrose, Hall Green.

The pensioner said: 'I will never go to the Tesco store again, but I want an apology.'

Her daughter Alison Walker, aged 54, has demanded to see in-store CCTV evidence of the trolley attacks from Tesco but it has not been provided.

She admitted: 'Mom's born and bred in 
Yorkshire and they're renowned for straight-talking, but I have never 
heard her swear or be rude in my life.'

But a Tesco spokesperson said: 'The well-being of our colleagues is very important to us and we have spoken to our customer several times to make her aware that we cannot tolerate abusive behaviour.

'Decisions to ban customers from stores are not made lightly and follow a full investigation.

'We are in touch with the customer and her family, and she is, of course, welcome to shop at other Tesco stores in the area.'
