A lightweight ATV specially designed for sneak attacks by the U.S. Special Operations Forces has been revealed days before its first and potentially last public showing before military combat use.

The C2 Commander, a Lightweight Tactical All-Terrain Vehicle, or LTATV, is one of three vehicles in a new line of LTATV Strike and Mobility Vehicles making their public debut next month by RP Advanced Mobile Systems.

The military grade ATV is specifically designed for completing low profile missions with its weight and size ideal for fast transport by small aircraft into the battlefield, according to RP, based out of Oregon.

New item: The C2 Commander, the first of three Lightweight Tactical All-Terrain Vehicles by RP Advanced Mobile Systems, will make its public debut next month for expected use by the U.S. Special Operations Forces

Ready to go: The military grade ATV's features a lighter weight and size making it ideal for fast transport by small aircraft into the battlefield

Features to the C2 Commander includes a rear open differential system (RODS) said to substantially add maneuverability on paved roads and in tight urban quarters, in addition to a 
locked rear differential for maximum off-road capability.

The vehicle also features an electrical support system that allows prolonged use of communications equipment while the engine isn’t running, strengthened bumpers for pushing other vehicles and obstacles, an upgraded suspension system, new Dynamic Power Steering, and a multimodal cargo bed for holding a variety of weapons systems, gear and medical litter for transporting injured troops.

The vehicle’s run-flat tires, at a cost of $250 each, are also said capable of taking a hit from a 7.62mm round before continually operating up to 75 miles at 45MPH while deflated.

The tires feature 14-inch aluminum bead lock wheels.

Features: It features strengthened bumpers for pushing other vehicles and obstacles and a multi-modal cargo bed for holding a variety of weapons systems, gear and medical litter for transporting injured troops

Run flat: The vehicle's SOF Series II 12-Ply Run-Flat Tires, one pictured, are said capable of taking a hit from a 7.62mm round before continuing up to 75 miles at 45MPH while deflated

Price tag: The vehicle is available for purchase only by the military at a price of $25,000

The seating system has also been upgraded to a Fatigue Mitigation MOLLE Tactical Seat system that uses a memory-foam type material for reducing fatigue during long rides over rough terrain.

It's available in colors Flat Black, Desert Sand, OD Green.

The latest design by RP, run by former USAF Special Operations Weapons Control Specialist Terry Wilmeth, is based on the Can-Am Commander, once called 'the most powerful rec-utility side-by-side you can buy' by RP.

As for previous light utility vehicles, today's are considered to have been inspired as far back as the Willys MB/Ford GPW, a Jeep used in World War II.

Predecessor: A covered Willys MB/Ford GPW is seen here, one of the first light utility vehicles said to have inspired the vehicles used today

Comparison: A Navistar MaxxPro Plus MRAP, seen here in 2008, is an obviously much larger and stronger vehicle built up from the original Jeep design while able to withstand mines

Those later evolved into the Jeep CJ, a civilian Jeep commonly seen on the streets today.

The C2 will cost approximately $25,000 but is only available to military.

The other two vehicles of the line up yet to be released are based on the Can-Am 101 HP Maverick 1000 in both 2-passenger and 4-passenger configurations.

The C2 Commander will make it public debut at the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference Association in Tampa in May in what could be its last public showing before its purchase with military costumers said to be currently evaluating its use.

Original: The C2 Commander is based on the Can-Am Commander, seen here being loaded off a helicopter

Legacy: The Can-Am Commander, pictured, was once 'the most powerful rec-utility side-by-side you can buy' according to RP
