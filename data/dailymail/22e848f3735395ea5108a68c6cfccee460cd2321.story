While some passengers may think that flight attendants get the better end of the bargain when it comes to places to take a snooze mid-flight, it seems that may not be the case at all.

In a new post penned by airline crew member Sarah Steegar - for travel information website FlyerTalk - she debunked some myths and revealed what it's really like behind the scenes when the cabin lights are dimmed.

Speaking about an image from airline company Boeing, Ms Steegar says this representation of the crew looking relaxed as they chat over a cup of coffee is unfortunately for her and many others, a misconception.

Flight attendant Sarah Steegar, said although people may think this is what breaks look like for cabin crew, the reality is far from it

'It looks so fun, right?! Like a kid’s treehouse, or a cozy clubhouse where no one can bother us unless it’s an emergency. Heaven! ... If I ever actually find time to do that on a flight, I’ll come back and let you know!' she wrote.

Ms Steegar, who has worked for a major US carrier for the past 15 years, goes on to say the 'cute' and 'vintage' scene portrayed never actually takes place, and the reality is much less glamorous.

'What really happens in crew bunks is more like a sprint to see how fast you can throw your body into a horizontal position and slam those eyes shut (and pray for actual sleep, especially if it’s only 6 p.m.).

'If a crew member is lucky (or unlucky) enough to nab the first break, they then need to make the tough decision to either sacrifice precious shut-eye to shovel some food into their mouth or try and sleep through hunger pains.

Ms Steegar, a veteran flight attendant, said the rest areas aren't always spacious and comfortable as people think they are

'And even if they did feel like catching up over a cuppa in the crew rest area, which is often substantially smaller than the public perceive them to be - it would more than likely be poorly received by colleagues.'

Ms Steegar also revealed the perils of having to share the rest room with other attendants who are a little more than inconsiderate.

'A certain flight attendant is on my mental hit list for how clumsily he comes into the bunkroom. He’s always 20 minutes late, bangs the door shut and carelessly tosses his shoes to the floor', she wrote.

Often the sleeping spaces are tucked away, and sometimes staff have no other option but to take a snooze sitting up behind a curtain

Also addressed was the variation in size of rest areas on aircraft, depending on the size of the plane, the airline company and the length of the flight.

Some planes don't even provide beds for the crew, but simply a single seat in a curtained off area of the plane, often just by where the passengers line up to use the bathroom.

'I've spent many a crew ''rest'' with a parade of bums pressed against my shoulder as passengers wait in line for the restroom on the other side of the curtain.

Inconsiderate crew members can also be a hassle when attendants are trying to get some shut eye 

'Sometimes I even open my eyes at the sound of snaps being undone, only to see the head of a Curious George passenger poking in to stare at us sleep,' Ms Steegar wrote.

She closed the piece with a reiterations that flight attendants certainly don't live a life of luxury lounging around in fancy bunks.

'When we do, it may not have the Boeing Book Club ambiance, but one thing is consistent: we’re intensely grateful for whatever we do get! Like you, I just hope for flights where I can get a horizontal space, even if just for a bit', Ms Steegar revealed.
