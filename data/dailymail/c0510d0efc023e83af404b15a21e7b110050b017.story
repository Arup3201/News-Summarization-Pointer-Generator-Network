Defiant: Prime Minster David Cameron denied his tough stance on benefit shirkers was unfair

David Cameron last night denied he is being 'cruel' by vowing to ban unemployed people who refuse to try to find a job from claiming the dole.

In a hard-hitting New Year message, he promised to 'get behind the workers' and crack down on the shirkers.

It came as he summoned Tory MPs to a private meeting, during which he will fire the starting gun for the 2015 General Election campaign.

An email sent by Chief Whip Sir George Young and obtained by The Mail on Sunday orders Conservative MPs to attend the gathering a week on Tuesday.

The Prime Minister, Tory chairman Grant Shapps and No 10 head of campaigns Stephen Gilbert will tell backbenchers that despite Labour's big lead in the polls, the Conservatives can still win the next Election.

Sir George wrote: 'The Prime Minister has asked me to invite you to an important meeting to focus on our campaign for the 2015 General Election.'

Mr Cameron plans to use the meeting to boost party morale, which is flagging after dire economic forecasts, revolts over gay marriage and Europe, and splits with his Liberal Democrat Coalition partners.

According to a poll by website ConservativeHome, two-thirds of party members expect Labour to be in power after the next Election, with only 12 per cent believing Mr Cameron will get a Commons majority.

One Tory backbencher said: 'It is highly unusual for a Prime Minister to start an Election campaign two-and-a-half years before the votes are counted.

'There has been a severe loss of confidence in the PM from some of us. It sounds like he intends to put a gun to our heads, saying, "Back me or we will lose the next Election."

'He trots out his, "We're all in this together" slogan, but it doesn't feel like that when he rams through daft policies like gay marriage. It wasn't in our last manifesto, so how can we trust him over the next one?'

In his New Year message, Mr Cameron praised Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith's plans to strip the long-term unemployed of benefits if they refuse to take part in schemes designed to help them find work.

The Prime Minister said: 'When people say we've got to stop our welfare reforms because somehow it is cruel to expect people to work, we are saying no. Getting people into good jobs is absolutely vital, not just for them, but for all of us.

'We inherited a welfare system that was out of shape and paid people not to work. So we made some big changes, and this New Year almost half a million more people are in work than last New Year.'

Mr Cameron rejected Labour claims that his economic policies have failed. The only way to compete with the rest of the world, he argued, is to continue cutting the national debt, cut taxes and carry on with radical reforms to welfare and schools.

He added: 'We are doing all this to get behind anyone who likes to work hard and get on in life.'

Mr Cameron said the Queen's Jubilee and the Olympics had made 2012 'an extraordinary year for our country'.

He said: 'If we are honest, it was a tough one too. For many families, making ends meet is difficult.'

However, he blamed Labour for leaving massive debts and said the Coalition was putting things right.

'Britain is in a global race with countries like China, India and Indonesia; a race for the jobs and opportunities of the future.

'So when people say we can slow down on cutting our debts, we are saying no. We can't win in this world with a great millstone of debt round our necks.' 

Radical plans to simplify the benefits system will encourage hundreds of thousands of young people to find work, a Minister claimed last night.

Welfare Reform Minister Lord Freud said Universal Credit, to be introduced late next year, will mean 300,000 under-25s will be up to about £100 a month better off if they get a job.
