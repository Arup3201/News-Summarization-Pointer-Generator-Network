The Tories will revive their £1million inheritance tax pledge at the next election.

David Cameron said yesterday the threshold should rise to ensure only the rich pay death duties.

Without action, the number of families paying the 40 per cent levy will double to one in ten over the next five years.

On Saturday, the Mail urged the Prime 
Minister to act, arguing in a leader that disillusioned Conservatives 
could back the party again if the thresholds on inheritance tax and 
stamp duty went up.

Yesterday Mr Cameron said the issue 
was ‘something we’ll have to address in our manifesto’. ‘I believe in 
people being able to pass money through the generations and pass things 
on to their children,’ he said.

‘You build a stronger society. 
Inheritance tax should only really be paid by the rich – it shouldn’t be
 paid by people who’ve worked hard and saved and who bought a family 
house.’

Mr Cameron’s intervention is part of a deliberate pitch to ‘grey voters’ who have been hit by low interest rates.

In last week’s Budget, George Osborne 
targeted a series of measures at the over-60s, including ‘pensioner 
bonds’ offering market-leading rates, increased ISA savings limits and 
opt-outs from pension annuities.

The Prime Minister suggested the 
Tories could revive their ‘brilliant’ pledge from the last election to 
raise the inheritance tax threshold to £1million when challenged over 
the broken promise by a prominent Tory councillor.

 During a question-and-answer session 
with Saga members in Peacehaven, East Sussex, he said the policy had 
been impossible to deliver because the Lib Dems were ‘very opposed’ to 
it in coalition negotiations. But he acknowledged that rising house 
prices had put it back on the agenda. Mr Cameron stressed that Mr 
Osborne’s proposal for a higher threshold had forced the then Labour 
government to effectively double the existing allowance for married 
couples.

Mr Cameron also hinted that he would protect benefits for wealthy from cuts in the next Tory manifesto

The move is also widely credited with 
killing off Gordon Brown’s plan to call a snap poll – ‘the election that
 never was’ of 2007. Mr Cameron said: ‘One of the reasons George Osborne
 made that pledge was this point about property.

‘When the limit was £300,000, quite a 
lot of hard-working families, who worked hard and saved and put money 
into their house, were being caught by inheritance tax.

Tax rates by the numbers

‘The ambition is still there – I would
 like to go further ... it’s something we’ll have to address in our 
manifesto.’ Mr Cameron appeared to be unsure of the existing rules – 
suggesting couples have a joint threshold of about £750,000. In fact the
 figure is £650,000, twice the £325,000 for a single person.

Tory sources yesterday said precise 
details of the party’s new stance would not be revealed until closer to 
the election. Experts also pointed out that the Treasury has frozen the 
threshold until 2017/8 to help pay for the introduction of the new cap 
on the cost of social care.

But Mr Cameron’s statement of intent will cheer many traditional Conservatives.

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘It is 
very encouraging. The Prime Minister is starting to show us what a 
proper Conservative government would look like.

‘This is becoming a big issue again 
because rising house prices mean that a lot of people who are not rich 
are being caught up by a tax that was meant for the very wealthy.

‘It is a natural urge to want to leave
 something for your children and it is wrong that people of average 
means who have worked hard all their lives are facing these punitive tax
 rates.’

Former Tory Cabinet minister John 
Redwood gave a more cautious welcome to the announcement, warning that 
other tax cuts, such as raising the 40p threshold or reducing capital 
gains tax, might take priority.

He said: ‘All tax cuts are good news, but there will be plenty of competition for which will be the best tax cuts.’

Tom Jones, deputy chairman of Lewes 
District Council, who challenged Mr Cameron over the issue yesterday, 
said a person’s main home should be excluded from inheritance tax 
altogether.

Mr Jones, son-in-law of Dame Vera 
Lynn, said: ‘I understand why we have not been able to keep our promise 
on this but it is disappointing.

‘House prices are rising year on year,
 if not month on month, and people who want to leave something for their
 children or grandchildren are being caught up by this. It is 
iniquitous.’

The Office for Budget Responsibility 
warned last week the proportion of estates hit by death duties was set 
to double from almost one in 20 to nearly one in ten during the next 
five years.

The independent forecaster said 
revenue from inheritance tax will soar by an average of almost 11 per 
cent a year as ever more families are dragged into it. Mr Cameron also 
hinted yesterday that he will repeat his manifesto pledge to protect 
pensioner benefits such as the winter fuel allowance and free TV licence
 at the next election.

The Labour lead over the Conservatives has narrowed dramatically in recent days, and is down to just one point in three different polls, including this one from YouGov for the Sunday Times

He said a final decision had yet to be
 taken, but he added that scrapping it would ‘save a tiny amount of 
money and introduce another complexity into the system’.

The Prime Minister also insisted that 
the new £75,000 cap on the costs of social care would prevent people 
having to sell their homes to pay for end-of-life care.
