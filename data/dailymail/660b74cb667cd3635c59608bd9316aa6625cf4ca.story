Gallipoli tour operators have been accused of misleading travellers by both the Australian and Turkish governments, ahead of next year's 100th anniversary of the Anzac landings.

To mark the anniversary, the entire Gallipoli historical national park will be closed to everyone but 10,500 Australian and New Zealand ballot winners and official guests - with the Department of Veterans' Affairs claiming they had been advising tourism operators of the fact since as early as 2010.

Despite the warnings, some cruise operators are misleading potential tourists by saying they are still waiting for authorities to 'finalise arrangements' for their docking points on the peninsula.

Deceptive marketing: Several Australian tour operators have come under fire for misleading potential customers about their proximity to next year's 100th anniversary of the Anzac landing in Gallipoli

Missing out: One tour operator has gone as far as charging a surcharge to guests which were lucky enough to win ballot tickets to the Anzac Cove site

Brisbane-based tourism operator Inner Faith Travel is claiming on its website that travellers 'will be in Anzac Cove to view the dawn service through the eyes of the Anzac's [sic] landing'.

In an online brochure for the tour, which costs a minimum of AU$5,985 per person, the operator said they were still waiting for authorities to 'finalise arrangements' for the tour.

However, in an advisory posted on its official Gallipoli 2015 website, the Department of Veterans' Affairs advises: 'The government of Turkey has also advised that no non-official Â­activities will be allowed to occur on the Gallipoli Peninsula on 24-25 April 2015.'

On their '100th Anniversary Anzac Tour To Turkey & Greece', which charges a minimum a AU$5,985.00 per person, those who were lucky enough to win ballot tickets will be charged a surcharge for actually attending the Dawn Service and official memorial services.

Inner Faith Travel passengers who missed out on tickets as part of the official ballot will be left to watch the events on large screens set-up on the ship's pool and theatre areas.

Not quite Anzac Cove adjacent: Inner Faith travel has come under fire for telling potential customers that they are awaiting final approval from authorities - despite knowing since at least 2012 that their ship would not be docking anywhere near the site

Another company under fire for misleading advertising is Military History Tours, who have a deal arranged for readers of News Corp newspapers, and promises to 'be ashore at Dawn on ANZAC Day with all onboard attending a 100th Anniversary Service.'

However, Military History Tours director Colonel Paul Murphy (ret) denies any wrongdoing on the part of his company.

'Our cruise ships are merely a hotel from the 21st to 25th of April,' Colonel Murphy told MailOnline.

He said that the ship will be docked at the International Wharf at the Dardanelles and that his company never advised potential customers that they will be near the cove.

'The only ships that will be seen from Anzac Cove will be visiting war ships, not cruise vessels,' he added.

MailOnline has sought comment from Inner Faith Travel.
