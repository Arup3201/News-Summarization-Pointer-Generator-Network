The mystery powerball winner from Queensland has come foward after discovering she had purchased the winning lottery ticket.

The Sunshine Coast woman, who wishes to remain annoymous, admitted she was unaware that there was a missing Powerball winner on the Sunshine Coast.

The new multi-millionnaire said she was too overwhelmed to say what she plans to do with her staggering $35.9 million Powerball windfall but did reveal she wants to share the prize money with her family.

'I’m feeling a little sick at the moment!  I’m just waiting to wake up from this dream!' the stunned winner exclaimed.

'I honestly never thought I’d win in last night’s $70 million Powerball draw.  I think the most I’ve ever won in lotto is about $20! So this is unbelievable! I can actually retire! I’ve wanted to retire for some time now.'

Two division one Powerball entries shared last night's $70 million Powerball jackpot, with the tickets entitling the winners to $35,904,620.67 each.

The other winning ticket was purchased in Great Western Sydney by a 15-person ticket syndicate, meaning that, with extra division prizes, each member is now more than $2.4 million richer.

The winning Powerball 12-game QuickPick was purchased at The Lucky Charm Noosaville in Noosaville.

Last night two entries shared in Powerball’s mind-blowing $70 million jackpot draw with each entry winning a first division share worth $35,904,620.67!

Aside from the winning entry sold in Noosaville, the other first division Powerball prize was claimed by a group of workmates from Western Sydney.

The 15-member syndicate purchased their winning Powerball entry from Bonnyrigg Plaza Newsagency in Bonnyrigg.

The syndicate won a total prize of $36,013,700.12 thanks to their System 9 entry type and each winner will claim a share of $2.4 million.

This is the largest jackpot prize offered in the country this year.

The winning numbers in the jackpot draw 953 on Thursday 21 August were 32, 8, 5, 40, 19 and 7, and the Powerball number was 12.

Powerball will offer a $3 million division one prize in next week’s draw.
