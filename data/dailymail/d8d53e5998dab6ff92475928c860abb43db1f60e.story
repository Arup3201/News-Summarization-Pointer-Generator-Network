Will Mauricio Pochettino lead Spurs into the Champions League next season?

Will Mauricio Pochettino lead Spurs into the Champions League next season?

Now share your opinion

Daniel Levy is a happy man. After the perceived debacle of Andre Villas-Boas and enduring months of boorish antics under Tim Sherwood, Tottenham believe they finally have their man.

Judging by the chairman’s comments on Monday, Mauricio Pochettino is the one to claw back Champions League riches. That’s the mantra as he settles in at White Hart Lane following resignation at Southampton and subsequent appointment in north London.

But, more to the point, Levy indicated that the Argentine will install that flowing, attractive football those around White Hart Lane are so fond of; The Tottenham Way.

And he's gone: Tim Sherwood was unceremoniously dumped by Spurs at the end of the last season

‘In Mauricio I believe we have a head coach who, with his high energy, attacking football, will embrace the style of play we associate with our club,' Levy enthused. 'He has a proven ability to develop each player as an individual, whilst building great team spirit and a winning mentality.

'We have a talented squad that Mauricio is excited to be coaching next season.'

It’s a populist view. A Sportsmail Spurs blogger was cheerleading in the hours after the announcement that supporters’ enthusiasm centres on the ‘swashbuckling’ Saints side of last season.

That appears to be a general consensus.

Let’s not forget, however, that this is the same Southampton side which found the net 54 times in the Premier League last season – the exact same as Swansea City. Every team above them scored more.

Pochettino doesn’t implore his side to pour forward; they keep the ball – pass, probe and weave their way to goal patiently and in a measured fashion. It served them exceptionally well and Southampton were one of the more attractive sides to watch.

That wasn't the problem! Emmanuel Adebayor and Christian Eriksen were excellent going forward last year 

However, if Tottenham fans – and, more importantly, the hierarchy – believe they’re in for a feast of goals they are likely to be disappointed.

Swashbuckling Sherwood would be a more appropriate fit if success was measured by the goals-for column. During his time at the club Spurs scored more times than Arsenal with strikers largely derided for their impotency.

Southampton didn’t actually see a marked difference in goalmouth action when Pochettino rocked up at St Mary’s. While in charge in the top flight, Nigel Adkins saw his side score 1.35 times a game. Pochettino’s record was 1.36.

They created fewer chances than Newcastle United during the last campaign and, interestingly, boasted a poorer record than Swansea away.

The 42-year-old is a sound choice given his record, but seemingly for the wrong reasons. In many ways, he is an extension of the meticulous Villas-Boas.

Southampton’s defensive record was excellent under him, managing to keep clean sheets in 35 per cent of their games. Just what was required, given shipping goals was one of the deciding factors in Adkins rightly getting the boot in January 2013. 

Major blow: Southampton could now lose the likes of Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and James Ward-Prowse

Cautious? Southampton actually created fewer chances per game than Newcastle under Pochettino

It’s no bad thing that Pochettino is more cautious - a bit of solidity is exactly what Spurs require. 

There is a much smaller chance of his Spurs side conceding three against West Ham in front of their own supporters, as well as five against Liverpool and Manchester City. Away from home they shouldn't be allowing City, Liverpool or Chelsea to notch four or more.

The facts tell their own story. Saints conceded 46 times last year, less than Brendan Rodgers’ Reds. As a direct comparison, Spurs saw the ball in their net on 51 occasions – more than Crystal Palace. Not good enough.

He needs to land players who are going to make a difference in a defensive sense, particularly at centre half. Going off Levy’s past dealings with his employees, cash to fund that won’t be a problem.

For any new manager at a club to have struggled, the way forward is by starting from the back and patience from above - not an attribute Spurs are renowned for. A five-year deal suggests, on the surface at least, that Pochettino will be afforded time. Boy, does he need it.
