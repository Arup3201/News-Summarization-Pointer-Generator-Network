A goal to repay his £3.25million fee in one go? Quite possibly. Carles Gil brought a sparkle seldom seen at Villa Park with a wonderful strike to avert the danger of another exit to lower-league opposition for Paul Lambert.

The Spaniard marked his first Aston Villa start following his move from Valencia in a style Lambert hoped, rather than expected. Picking up the ball from Christian Benteke on the right, he drove at Ian Harte, cut inside and waved his left-foot like a wand to send the ball arcing beautifully into the far corner.

A moment to get the Villa fans off their seats, a moment that gave hope for the future. This was only their second goal in more than 11 hours of play but Gil is a player alright, his strike the high point of an appearance full of promise.

Andreas Weimann added a second goal that ultimately proved the winner when Callum Wilson struck in added time for the visitors. It was only the third time this season Villa have scored more than once in a game. So an upset of sorts.

It is Gil’s contribution, however, that will live in the memory.

Villa Park was given a much-needed lift 10 minutes before kick-off with the announcement that Fabian Delph had signed a new four-and-a-half year contract.

The England midfielder addressed the crowd via a video over the big screens, but his words were largely inaudible and it needed the stadium announcer to clarify the positive news.

Delph was absent from the Villa line-up, which featured six changes to Lambert’s last selection. Gil was handed his full debut, and Ciaran Clark returned from suspension to captain the side.

Shay Given, Kieran Richardson and Leandro Bacuna were the trio who could not be classed as regular starters.

Howe stuck to his usual pattern and made wholesale changes – eight from the team that lost to Leeds United in midweek.

Tommy Elphick and Steve Cook retained their places, as did Harry Arter. He was instrumental in Bournemouth performing better than the Premier League side throughout the first half.

Arter’s movement and passing – operating in front of Villa the defence – appeared an illustration of what Lambert’s team have lacked during their barren scoring run.

Villa failed to register a shot on target in the opening period – but should have done after nine minutes. Weimann timed his run to meet Hutton’s cross from the right without breaking stride but sent his header wide as the home fans readied themselves for a cathartic release of noise.

From then, it was Howe’s Championship leaders who fashioned the better opportunities. Arter put through Shaun MacDonald with a one-touch pass and the Bournemouth midfielder rounded Given to send a shot towards goal. Richardson recovered to clear near the line. 

In the 32nd minute Eunan O’Kane struck from range requiring a tip wide from Given at full-stretch and then Arter saw a shot deflected into the side-netting. O’Kane tried again, this time sending a curling effort just over.

Shortly before half-time O’Kane fed Yann Kermorgant but as the striker bore down on goal to pull the trigger Jores Okore performed an excellent sliding tackle.

Christian Benteke was continuing to perform with little gusto and boos from the Holte End greeted the interval whistle. The stage seemed set for another exit to lower league opposition.

But up stepped Gil to produce a different kind of FA Cup magic. Lambert wheeled around in celebration that his January signing had paid immediate dividends.

Turns out Villa scoring was this game’s Cup shock, and the surprise was doubled with another lovely goal 19 minutes from the end.

Bacuna picked out Hutton’s run down the right and the Scot pulled back a first-time cross to Weimann, who applied a cushion finish into the far corner.

Bournemouth found the net in injury time, when Adam Smith pulled back a cross for substitute Callu Wilson to convert. Could the Cherries do a Bradford?

No. As they pushed for an unlikely equaliser, Villa mounted a counter-attack that saw Benteke feed substitute Ashley Westwood whose shot was heading in until Lee Camp stretched a hand.

No matter. Villa advance, and all of a sudden find themselves with an opportunity to find a silver lining from this most gloomy of seasons.
