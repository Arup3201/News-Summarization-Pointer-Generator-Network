New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Friday acted on new legislation that will make it easier for children and teenagers suffering from serious illnesses to obtain medical marijuana.

Christie agreed to sign the so-called pot-for-tots bill if the New Jersey legislature makes changes, including removing wording that would have reduced the number of required physician recommendations for children.

He also agreed that children should be allowed access to edible forms of marijuana besides lozenges, considered difficult for young patients to use properly, but asked for tighter language in the bill to be sure only minors can get the medication.

Governor Chris Christie: He has said he will sign a bill to help sick children get access to medical marijuana if lawmakers tweak the bill to ensure only qualifying patients get the drug

Pushing for change: Father, Brian Wilson, asked Gov. Christie to change the law in order that an edible form of medical marijuana-- not sold at dispensaries in the state-- becomes available for their sick child

Hope at last: Vivian Wilson suffers from a severe form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome. She started having seizures at two months old. They say she still seizes, on average, 15 times a day. Her parents believe medicinal cannabis could help

Christie agreed with other parts of the bill, including eliminating the three-strain cultivation limit on authorized dispensaries, which would allow growers to develop products tailored for individual patients, including some adults, according to proponents.

Christie, who is running for re-election as New Jersey's governor and widely considered a contender for president in 2016, gave his 'conditional' approval to the bill but sent it back to the legislature with the suggested changes.

Christie previously worried about going 'down the slippery slope of broadening a program and making it easier to get marijuana that wouldn't necessarily go to other people'â€”and these modifications are perhaps a strategic compromise to not slide down the 'slippery slope.'

'Today, I am making commonsense recommendations to this legislation to ensure sick children receive the treatment their parents prefer, while maintaining appropriate safeguards,' Christie said in a statement released Friday. 'I am calling on the Legislature to reconvene quickly and address these issues so that children in need can get the treatment they need.'

'As I have repeatedly noted, I believe that parents, and not government regulators, are best suited to decide how to care for their children,' Christie continued.

But some of the bill's sponsors preferred the original language, which would open up the number of marijuana strains and ingestible forms to a wider range of patients, as well as an easier application process.

Change: For parents to get their kids the strains of marijuana they need three different doctors to sign off on the prescriptions for their kids but now it is hoped a change in the law will simplify things

Cure: Vivian Wilson, of Scotch Plains, New Jersey, is among a number of patients with legal authorization to receive medical marijuana. But, her parents say, she has yet to receive any medication due to the state's restrictive medical marijuana program

'I think it is ironic that Governor Christie believes that parents and government regulators should make the decision. This might be the most regulated law in the state,' state Sen. Joseph Vitale, one of the primary sponsors of the bill, told CNN Friday.

'The last thing we want is to delay it for the kids, so we want to pass it as soon as possible,' Vitale continued. 'It still requires too many unnecessary hurdles with physicians, but I don't think we should hold it up anymore.'

Assemblyman Reed Gusciora said older residents who can't ingest marijuana smoke should have access to an edible form. But he, too, prefers prompt action on the bill.

New Jersey is one of 19 states with a medical marijuana program, but the state's rules have made it difficult for young patients to enroll in treatment, according to proponents of the bill.

The legislation has been sitting on Christie's desk for nearly two months and his conditional approval comes two days after he was confronted at a campaign stop by a Scotch Plains father whose 2-year-old suffers from Dravet Syndrome, a potentially deadly form of epilepsy.

Brian Wilson urged Christie in a restaurant full of voters to sign the bill saying, 'Don't let my daughter die.'

Wilson said the kind of marijuana that helps stop his daughter's seizures currently is grown only in Colorado.

Simplified: If the bill is passed only one doctor's authorization would be required for dispensing medical marijuana to a child. Currently three doctors are required to sign off on a child's prescription

Brian Wilson told CNN's Jake Tapper: 'While it is a small victory ... it really just maintains the idea of making (New Jersey) one of the worst medical marijuana programs in the country. So it's a small victory but it's kind of ludicrous in a lot of ways.'

Christie wants the state to keep the existing requirement of approval by at least a pediatrician and a psychiatrist for a child to be part of the medical marijuana program.

'The psychiatrist is just a roadblock,' Wilson said. 'There's no rhyme or reason to have a psychiatrist be part of this decision. You're talking about sick kids who aren't even mentally necessarily capable of talking. Vivian can't even talk.'

Christie acknowledged that marijuana is a controlled substance under U.S. federal law and 'implementing a state controlled program while the drug remains illegal has raised numerous challenges.'

The administration of President Barack Obama has discouraged federal prosecutors from pursuing people who distribute marijuana for medical purposes under state laws.
