A British holidaymaker has allegedly been raped in her hotel room by a security guard at the popular Egyptian resort where she was staying.

The guard had been escorting the lone woman back to a five-star hotel in Sharm-el-Sheikh when it is believed he pulled her into her bedroom and subjected her to the brutal assault.

The alleged victim, a businesswoman in her 40s, was given emergency help by the British Consulate in the Red Sea resort.

The attack comes as the Foreign Office warns about a rise in cases of sexual assault against Britons in Egypt  since the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011, including in hotels.

The victim has been flown back to Britain, and Hampshire Police are now leading the investigation.

She has been interviewed by detectives but may have to return to Egypt. It is understood she is recovering at home with the help of friends and relations.

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ‘We are aware of an incident involving a British national. We are providing assistance.’ Its website warns British tourists about a rise in crime.

It goes on to say: ‘Reports of cases of sexual assault against British nationals have increased during and since the unrest of early 2011.

‘In 2012, the FCO handled  23 cases of sexual assault and six cases of rape.

‘Some assaults were against minors. Many occurred in what were considered to be safe places such as hotels.

‘Assaults have occurred in taxis and on microbuses.

The Egyptian resort was attacked by terrorists before but has remained popular with British sun-seekers

‘If you are travelling on a microbus, avoid being the last passenger left on the bus. Women should take extra care when travelling alone.’

According to figures from the Egyptian government, there have been three rapes in Sharm-el-Sheikh over the past two years and numerous incidents in which tourists have been sexually harassed by hotel staff.

The resort has also been subjected to a number of terrorist attacks and in 2005 11 Britons were among  88 people killed by bombs.

Last month, Germany evacuated the resort of its nationals amid new terror threats, though the Foreign Office said it was not advocating similar action.

However, the resort has remained hugely popular with British holidaymakers as a destination for winter sun.
