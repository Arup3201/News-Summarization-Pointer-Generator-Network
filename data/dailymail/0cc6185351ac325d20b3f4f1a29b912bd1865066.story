Father of four Charlie Howard laboured long and hard in his own time to try to make his children’s walk to school safer.

Giving up three weekends, he built a set of steps down a muddy embankment to keep them off a busy road.

But his good deed failed to impress the health and safety police... who ruled the creation was a hazard in itself and ordered him to demolish it.

Without
the steps, the children must scramble down the slippery bank or cross 
the road at a bend further along the road and walk 100 yards with no 
pavement to reach the bus stop. Mr Howard went to work without complaint
to try to eradicate the danger, taking his nine-year-old son Tommy with
him to help build the steps. 

But two weeks later he received a letter from Magna Housing Association which owns the embankment in Bridport, Dorset.

He
was told that should anyone fall and hurt themselves while using the 
steps the association would be liable for any litigation.

Hazard: The children's route to the bus taking in the muddy embankment, with steps now dismantled

Magna Housing Association ordered the father to remove the steps and hand rail as they would be liable for damages if anyone were to injure themselves

Without the steps, children have to either scramble up and down the slippery bank or walk 100 yards along a busy road with no pavement and cross it on a bend to reach the bus stop

Mr
Howard, who also has a seven-year-old son and two daughters aged six 
and four, has taken the steps down but described the authority’s 
reaction as ‘ridiculous’ because it has made the children’s journey to 
Salway Ash primary school more hazardous.

The
37-year-old, who owns a vehicle restoration company, said: ‘I only 
spent about £10 doing it because a lot of the materials I had left over 
from work.

‘It was much 
safer than what was there before. The school bus stops directly opposite
the steps, so the children and my wife just have to walk down the steps
and cross the road at a straight point.’

He
said the children now have to slide down the bank or ‘walk about 100 
yards down a road with no pavement, cross the road on a junction and 
walk back against traffic’.

Mr
Howard added: I have reluctantly taken them down now but it is a 
ridiculous thing to have to do – now they are far more dangerous.’

Bob
Roberts, of Magna Housing Association, said: ‘The steps are on Magna’s 
land and if anyone were to be injured we may be liable.

‘We cannot risk this and this is why we asked the residents to remove the steps.’
