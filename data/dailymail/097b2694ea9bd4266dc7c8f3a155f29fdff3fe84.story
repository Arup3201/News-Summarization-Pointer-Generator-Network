Danny Welbeck has admitted dreaming of playing for Arsenal even before his £16million deadline-day move to the Emirates Stadium from Manchester United.

Welbeck revealed in an interview with Arsenal's website that he had always admired his new club's style from afar and pledged to capitalise on service from the Gunners' 'magnificent' midfield.

The England forward also expressed his delight that the transfer had 'finally' gone through.

'It's exciting times for me,' he said. 'It's great to be a part of this club and it's a team that I've always watched in the Premier League. I've envisaged myself playing in this team before. For it to finally happen is very exciting.'  

Welbeck undoubtedly has huge potential but still has plenty to prove after a meagre goalscoring return during his time at Old Trafford. 

The England forward notched just 29 goals in 142 first-team appearances for United, albeit with many of those coming from the substitutes bench or while shunted out on the wing playing a support role to Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney.

The 23-year-old has craved a genuine opportunity to prove himself as a top-class central striker, which he should now get at Arsenal with Olivier Giroud out for four months with an ankle injury. And Welbeck has promised that he can be a roaring success while feeding off chances created by the likes of Alexis Sanchez, Jack Wilshere and Mesut Ozil.

'I believe the style of play the manager's got and the boys play and with the magnificent players in midfield slotting balls through, I can run on to the end of those balls and slot them away,' said Welbeck.

Time to shine: Welbeck grew up as a young player at United but is excited to haveb now joined Arsenal

The England forward, who has scored eight goals in his 26 international appearances, admitted to having mixed feelings as he prepared to quit the club where he had grown up.

'I've been at United ever since I was a little boy and I had a great time there,' he said. 'I just think this is the next stage of my development - to come to Arsenal, to really show people what I can do as a footballer and hopefully get to the place where I want to be.

'Things move on in life and I think you've really got to make the right decision in the situation that you're in at that moment in time.

'I really do believe that coming to Arsenal is the right decision.'

He added: 'I'm an Arsenal player and I couldn't be any happier at the moment.' 

The Manchester-born forward was clear when asked about what he can add to Arsenal's side.

'I'd like to bring pace and power to the game,' he said, while also expressing admiration for the Gunners' famous short-passing game.

'I like to join in on that and get in behind defenders and try to get shots off at goal,' he added. 

Despite the excitement around Welbeck's signing, some observers have still questioned Wenger's judgement in bringing in a player with potential rather than shelling out to beat United to the loan deal for Radamel Falcao. 

The Colombia striker was seen as a potential missing link for Arsenal to become true contenders to win the Premier League, but Welbeck insists that he can be the man to fire the club to the title.

'They've done well in recent years, last year we got the FA Cup and I feel like it's time where we could really push on and try and challenge for the Premier League title,' he said. 'I've got one (Premier League) medal and it's something that I really want to add to.'
