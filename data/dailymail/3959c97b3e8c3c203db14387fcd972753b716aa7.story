A widow has told of her fury after receiving a letter addressed to her husband which ordered him to go for a disability benefits check-up two months after he died.

Julia Mullins, 54, said she was outraged to receive the letter asking her late husband Stuart to undergo medical tests for Disability Living Allowance, especially as she had informed government organisations of his death on October 15.

Mrs Mullins, from Newport, south Wales, described the letter, which she received from Atos Healthcare on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) on December 21, as 'absolutely disgusting'.

The letter (pictured) requested that Stuart, who died from cancer aged 53 on October 14, attend a medical assessment for his Disability Living Allowance claim at Newport Medical Examination Centre on January 20

She said: 'It was disgusting, absolutely disgusting. I was so upset and it was really upsetting at the time as you are already missing someone at Christmas.'

The letter requested that Stuart, who died from cancer aged 53 on October 14, attend an assessment for his benefit claim at Newport Medical Examination Centre on January 20.

The father of one had been using a walking stick and wheelchair due to limited mobility in his left leg and ankle and was claiming living allowance.

He died at his family home in Somerton, Newport, just months after being diagnosed with cancer.

Mrs Mullins said: 'He was a lovely, wonderful man. He made so many people happy and he is sorely missed.'

Atos Healthcare - which provides independent assessments on behalf of the DWP for a range of government benefit schemes - yesterday apologised for the blunder.

A spokesman said: 'We are sorry for any distress this has caused.

'Unfortunately, unless we are asked by the Department to withdraw a case from our system, we will automatically send out a letter.'

A DWP spokesman added: 'Our thoughts are with the family of Mr Mullins.

'We are sincerely sorry for the mistake that was made and understand the distress that this has caused.'
