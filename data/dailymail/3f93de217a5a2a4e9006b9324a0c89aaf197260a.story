David Cameron's attempt to recover from his defeat to Ukip in the Rochester by-election was hit last night by a Downing Street row over whether Britain is ‘full’ of immigrants.

An ‘immigration summit’ led to an angry clash between the PM’s allies and rebels demanding a tougher response to Nigel Farage.

Former Cabinet Minister Peter Lilley is said to have claimed the UK must shut the door to EU migrants, arguing: ‘Britain is full.’

He was backed by senior MPs on the Number 10 policy board, but branded ‘shrill’ by one of the PM’s aides. Jo Johnson, brother of Boris and head of the policy unit working on the party’s Election manifesto, also challenged his claim.

And pro-Cameron MP Margot James praised ‘hard-working Poles and Bulgarians’, arguing the Tories ‘must not dance to Ukip’s tune’. The details have emerged as the Prime Minister faces criticism from two leading MPs in the wake of Thursday’s defeat at the hands of Ukip defector Mark Reckless.

Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the Tory 1922 Committee, calls on Mr Cameron in today’s Mail on Sunday to kick out renegade MPs who have flirted with Ukip. And former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis says he must close ‘the yawning gap between Britain’s political leadership and the people they serve’ or lose the Election.

The summit was held on Tuesday to prepare for a crunch speech on immigration which Mr Cameron is expected to give within days – which MPs hope will include a vote-winning set of migration curbs.

According to one account, the row at Number 10 flared after Mr Lilley demanded a so-called ‘emergency brake’ on migrants from the EU.

‘Most people believe Britain is full – and they are right. We are already a nation of more than 60 million. We cannot take any more and have to shut the door,’ he said.

Mr Johnson appeared to suggest immigration fears are exaggerated. He reportedly said that ‘95 per cent of Britain is undeveloped’. One insider said: ‘It sounded as though Johnson was saying there is plenty of room for more immigrants.’

Mr Lilley, who yesterday attended a conference of the Eurosceptic Bruges Group with Mr Reckless, was called ‘shrill’ by Mr Cameron’s immigration special adviser, Daniel Korski, who once worked for the former EU High Commissioner, Labour’s Baroness Cathy Ashton.

Others rallied behind Mr Lilley. Lancashire MP Jake Berry said Mr Cameron must not be ‘outflanked’ by Ed Miliband. The Labour leader last week pledged to deny dole to new EU immigrants for two years. Many Tory MPs want an even longer ban.

A well-placed source said: ‘It was pretty lively. It was Jo, Margot and Korski versus Lilley and the rest.’

Mr Johnson, 42, has argued for stronger ties with India. Some pundits say he is brainier than brother Boris and could beat him to the Tory leadership. A former banker, he is married to Amelia Gentleman, who writes for the Guardian newspaper.

Millionairess entrepreneur Ms James, 57, is the first openly lesbian Conservative MP. She gave those at the meeting a written statement, which said: ‘There is a danger that the anti-immigration and anti-EU minority tail is wagging the majority British dog. There is a clear case that needs to be made for immigration. Their role in wealth creation should not be underestimated.

‘The day people are put off by the constant negative rhetoric about people coming to this country, and stop coming, is the day we will have far more to worry about.’

She is said to have highlighted a recent poll which showed that more than two thirds of the public would not vote for Ukip in any circumstance.

Mr Lilley, 71, a hardliner on welfare and immigration, once wrote a pamphlet entitled ‘Immigration, too much of a good thing’. In 1992 he called for an end to the ‘something for nothing society’ via a parody of the Lord High Executioner’s ‘Little List’ song from Gilbert and Sullivan’s Mikado.

A source said: ‘Jo Johnson and Korski are part of the cosy Downing St chumocracy. They just don’t get ordinary people’s concerns about immigration.’

Jo Johnson, left, head of David Cameron's policy unit called for calm claiming that fears over immigration are being 'exaggerated'. However, one Tory branded Johnson  as part of 'the cosy Downing St chumocracy'

But a Government aide said there was concern at the tone of some of the comments, adding: ‘Some of them sounded more like Nigel Farage than Conservative MPs. They were coming out with crude stuff like “we’ve got to stop Poles stealing the jobs of our voters”.’

The Prime Minister has discussed with aides the logistics of imposing a ‘brake’ on individual EU countries when, for example, migrants reach a specified proportion of the UK’s population. He has been advised by the Foreign Office that as the treaties stand, any brake could only be triggered in the event of an emergency such as a natural disaster.

In his article, Mr Walker says his party ‘put aside its moral compass’ during the Rochester by-election by ‘banging on’ about immigration.

‘We fought the wrong campaign against Mark Reckless and have paid the price,’ he writes. ‘In recent weeks and months we have allowed the terms of the debate to be framed and set by the pernicious, dripping, corrosive cynicism of Ukip.’

And in his article, below, Mr Davis says: ‘The Rochester result is not some bolt out of the blue. It is the inevitable result of the most dramatic shift in voter behaviour in our lifetimes.’ Last night, Mr Johnson declined to comment.

But a Number 10 spokesman said: ‘This is not a fair and accurate representation of the meeting.’

When contacted, Mr Lilley also declined to comment on the discussions. Ms James and Mr Berry could not be reached for comment.  

David Davis, pictured, warned that the Conservatives and Labour can no longer count on the support of two-thirds of the electorate 

On Tuesday I walked the streets of Rochester trying to persuade Ukip voters to vote Conservative. As I did so, in the Commons the Government was suffering a defeat on pub regulation, as publicans won the right to buy beers from somebody other than the owner of their pub chain. It was a victory for private enterprise over big business. The Government was seen to be on the side of big business.

Only the week before, it effectively denied the house a proper debate on the critical European Arrest Warrant. The voters of Rochester would have said, ‘I told you so’. They would see these incidents as part and parcel of the problem with modern politics, that the leadership of all the main parties are aloof, out of touch and have little interest in ordinary people. Emily Thornberry’s tactless tweet characterised all too clearly what an ever growing part of the electorate see as the Westminster elite’s scornful view.

The Rochester result is not some bolt out of the blue. It is the inevitable result of the most dramatic shift in voter behaviour in our lifetimes. As it stands, 44 per cent of voters will back a different party at the General Election than in 2010. The biggest migrants are Conservatives joining Ukip, and Liberal Democrats joining Labour. But all parties are losing significant support to ‘don’t know’.

As a result, the Conservatives and Labour can no longer command even two-thirds of the electorate’s support. The sense of rejection of the establishment was put best by the victim of Emily Thornberry’s tweet when he said, ‘I’ve not voted and I’m not going to. No matter who you have in, it doesn’t matter.’

This sense of disenfranchisement hurts all of us, but as the party in power it hurts us most of all. This is why on the best polls available in the Conservatives’ marginal seats, those commissioned by Lord Ashcroft, we seem set to lose a disastrous proportion.

After Tony Blair stood down in 2007 there was a public desire for clarity, coherence and principle after years of spin. We were unable to harness it in 2010. I believe it is not too late to tap into that mood now. In the six months leading up to the General Election, we are free of the shackles of the Coalition. What we say and do are more about what happens after the Election than before. That means we should be able to address the issues of Europe, immigration, welfare and taxation with more clarity than has been the case in the last four years.

Lord Ashcroft's polls of marginal seats show the Conservatives losing 'a disastrous proportion'

But in the end the public are not just making a judgement on policy. They are also making a judgment on character. They want to believe that their leaders understand their problems, care about their problems, and have the courage, strength and clarity of purpose to do something about them.

This is the yawning gap between Britain’s political leadership and the people they serve that has to be closed. If we can do that, we will win the next Election. If not, no amount of incompetence on the part of Labour will save us from yet another defeat.
