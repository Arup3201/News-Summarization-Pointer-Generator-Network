Researchers
have taken a step closer to creating ‘cyborg insects’ that could carry out
spying missions - with biofuel cells that run off their own bodies.

A
team has created the implantable power packs that use the insects’ own body
chemistry to fuel robot attachments fixed on to them.

The
breakthrough brings us one step closer to the the day when bugs can be fitted
with recording devices, sensors or other electronics and used as tiny spies - an area which the U.S. military's 'mad scientist' division, DARPA, has already researched extensively.

Until now researchers had relied on solar power or conventional batteries but they were not powerful enough or did not last long enough to do the tasks required. The ¿cyber bugs¿ could potentially keep going for days on end - or even for as long as they are alive

The U.S military's Darpa research wing is already researching how to 'control' insects using hi-tech attachments.

'Bees have been used to locate mines and weapons of 
mass destruction. The Hybrid Insect Micro Electromechanical Systems program is aimed at developing technology to provide control 
over insect locomotion, just as reins are needed for effective control 
over horse locomotion,' says Darpa'ssite.

The new technique, where the insect could 'power' electronic attachments using its own body chemistry, could be crucial.

Until
now researchers had relied on solar power or conventional batteries but they
were not powerful enough or did not last long enough to do that tasks required.

The ‘cyber bugs’ could potentially keep going for days on end - or even for as long
as they are alive.

The
research from Case Western Reserve University in the U.S. involved putting two
enzymes into cockroaches to break down the complex molecules they make after
eating.

The
first turns the molecules into sugar, and the second oxidises it - in the
process releasing electrons.

These
electrons are then run into the battery and produce a current.

One
of the advantages of the technique is that the insect does not have to be in
motion for the current to flow, meaning a bug can be put in an enclosed space
and the battery will still work.

After
the tests the Case Western team put electrodes into the insects and found there
was no long-term damage, which means they could be re-used for a number of
missions.

Daniel
Scherson, chemistry professor at Case Western and senior author of the paper,
said that the possible uses were endless.

He
said: ‘An insect equipped with a sensor could measure the amount of noxious gas
in a room, broadcast the finding, shut down and recharge for an hour, then take
a new measurement and broadcast again.’

The
research team are now trying to make the battery as small as possible so the
insect can fly or move around without the power pack restricting it.

They
have calculated that the maximum output from the battery is currently 100
microwatts per square centimeter, at 0.2 volts.

A
typical AA battery, the kind used to power many electronic devices, provides
1.5 volts.

In
a separate study, a team from the University of Michigan are developing
techniques to harness the movement and body heat of cockroaches which could
provide an alternative way of powering gadgets attached to them.
