An elementary school classroom aide who was suspended after the school discovered her partially-nude modeling shots has returned to work.

Kaitlin Pearson, 23, was notified on Monday that she 
could return to her job teaching special-needs students at South Street Elementary School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts and went back on Tuesday.

Fitchburg schools superintendent Andre Ravenelle said in a statement that Pearson was reinstated after the school reviewed 'all relevant information' following an investigation into her second job.

Pearson has not responded to messages for comment, but her father told WBZ-TV that his daughter loves her job and is happy to be back.

Racy: Kaitlin Pearson, 23, was suspended 
from her teacher's aide job over images of her posing partially nude - but she has now gone back to work. She shared some of the images on her 
Instagram page, pictured

Posing: Pearson has also shared the images on her public Facebook page. Here, she poses for selfies

She was suspended with pay last week after the racy photos were sent anonymously to the school and to the Sentinel & Enterprise
 newspaper with a note saying, 'Can you believe that this girl was hired
 to work with special education children in the Fitchburg schools?!!'

The school said they were investigating whether the job affected her ability to work with children.

Some images show her posing in bikinis or sportswear at sports events, and she has appeared in multiple amateur shoots, including for ModelsMania magazine.

Other photographs that have since surfaced online show Pearson, who has a long term boyfriend, posing partially nude as she embraces other naked female models.

Model: Pearson, pictured with her boyfriend, has been working full-time at the school since November

In the cover of a September 2013 issue of ModelsMania magazine, she appears with another topless woman.

In an online profile for Model Mayhem she specifically says she does not pose fully nude.

'I
 am energetic, creative, feisty, passionate about modeling, and I bring 
my love of life to every shoot!' she writes. 'I'm balancing modeling 
with a full time job, so my time is very precious. I am here to expand 
my modeling horizons and am interested in serious opportunities.'

The racy images can also be found on Pearson's open Facebook page.

Parents had a mixed reaction to the photos.

Online presence: The Massachusetts school says it does not carry out online searches for prospective employees before hiring them, but after the incident with Pearson, pictured, it may consider it

Probe: South Street Elementary School staff have now collected all 'relevant information' in their investigation

'You're trying to be a role model for the kids,' said parent Andy Saocedo, while another added: 'She probably leaves work at work and her modeling career separate from her teaching career.'

Her mother, Chuck Pearson, insisted that her daughter should not be fired for the photos.

'That's her private life,' she said. 'She's 23. She's a grown up woman.'

The school system carried out criminal background checks on prospective employees, but does not carry out checks across social media.

Ravenelle added that school officials have not 'Googled' people before hiring them, but may now start doing so in light of this incident.
