Lawrence Okoye said the ankle injury sustained in the pre-season defeat to the Baltimore Ravens was 'nothing serious'.

The San Francisco 49ers defensive end was taken for an X-ray after team-mate Quinton Dial rolled onto his left leg in the fourth quarter of the 20-3 loss.

The following play, he clutched his left leg at the snap and received medical attention.

Speaking during training camp, Okoye spoke of his progress as he attempts to make the remarkable jump from Olympic discus thrower to NFL player.

'It’s just crazy, really. I can’t really watch last year’s tape. It’s just too hard to watch. I cringe too much. Now, I feel like a football player and it’s time to keep progressing.

'I’ve got a really tough group I’m competing with. We spur each other on and everyone’s getting better off each other.'

The 22-year-old, who holds the British record for discus and competed for Great Britain in London 2012, was signed by the 49ers as an undrafted free agent in April 2013.

Okoye was placed on injured reserve last season after suffering a knee injury against the Minnesota Vikings in pre-season.

The 49ers host the Broncos on Sunday in their next pre-season game and open the NFL season with a trip to Arlington to face the Dallas Cowboys.
