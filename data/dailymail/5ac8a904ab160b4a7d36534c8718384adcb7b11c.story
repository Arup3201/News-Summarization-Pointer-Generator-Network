The eldest of four Sydney bothers who fled to Syria to fight with ISIS and were deemed 'too fat to fight' has now been spurned by his scorned fiancee.

Omar El Baf, who spent thousands of dollars on a 'honeymoon' and furniture for his former-wife-to-be just days before he fled overseas, contacted her out of the blue.

But one of the men who was considered too out of shape to help the Islamic terrorists fight in the Middle East has now been rejected again, as his heartbroken fiancee has blocked him on Facebook and vowed never to speak with him again, reports the Sydney Morning Herald.

Omar El Baf, (far right), has messaged his-ex fiancée on Facebook. It is the first sign the four brothers are alive since they fled to Syria in November

Omar paid $13,000 for his future honeymoon just a couple of days before he vanished in November, as well as a deposit for furniture for their future home.

The Facebook message is the first and only sign that the four siblings from Yagoona in south-west Sydney, who have not been heard from in months, are still alive.

The four men, aged between 17 and 28, told their parents they were taking a holiday in Thailand after winning tickets in a competition.

They later revealed via a text message to their sister that they had arrived to Syria. 'We made it to Bilad al-Sham, we will see you in paradise,' the message read.

The parents believe their boys have been lured into the clutches of the Islamic State terrorist organisation.

Bilad al-Sham is a region in Syria. Despite the text, the parents went to the airport to pick up their sons but they never arrived.

They now believe their boys have been lured into the clutches of the Islamic State terrorist organisation.

Unlike some before them, the siblings were 'clean-skins' and had not been on any watch-lists that would have alerted immigration controls.  

In a statement last month, their mother pleaded with them to come home.

'My sons, you are dear to us. You are good at heart. You have done nothing wrong. Come back. We love you.'

In November, leading Islamic community leader Dr Jamal Rifi told radio station2UE: 'The family is distraught, their main concern is to initiate contact, the concern are not concerned how they were radicalised but that they want them to come back.

He said the brothers showed no signs of radicalisation before they left,  and that he suspects that that someone in Australia convinced them to travel to Syria.

Dr Rifi said the family alerted the authorities to the brothers' departure and it was now up to them to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'.

Unlike some before them, the siblings were 'clean-skins' and had not been on any watch-lists that would have alerted immigration controls.
