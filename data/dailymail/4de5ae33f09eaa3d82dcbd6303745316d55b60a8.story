Bounding up and down the football field dressed to the nines, this dog's certainly ready for some Super Bowl action.  

Munchkin the Instagram-famous Shih Tzu, is seen in a new video out on a playing field in Southern California wearing her comical teddy bear suit which has been adapted in preparation for Sunday's sporting event.

The 8lb canine's red, blue and white ensemble indicates she's rooting for the New England Patriots. It includes white shorts, a red jersey with the number '00' and a padded safety helmet.  

A football also rests neatly Munchkin's paw. In one photograph, her outfit is topped off with a pair of football boots.

The pup took to the spotlight last fall when she debuted a rather unscary Halloween bear costume.

Her owner Cindy Roth crafted the fluffy ensemble out of a plush toy.

She then posted photographs and videos of Munchkin online, with many fans likening the animal to an 'adorable' version of the Star Wars Ewoks.

An 11-second film shows Munchkin bounding up to the camera completely unaware of how funny she looks.

To make the costume, Roth measured Munchkin up and selected an appropriately sized toy. 

She also picked a teddy with matching sandy-colored fur. She then cut the face, feet and back out of the soft bear and removed all of the stuffing except for the arms.

To finish, Roth inserted Munchkin's front arms into the teddy's legs.

Munchkin appears to have a penchant for dressing up and another photo shows her modeling a party hat, complete with pink feather trim.

Her novel antics have secured her a burgeoning fan base, with her YouTube channel boasting more than ten million hits.
