Margaret Gretton, who was dismissed from her role at Burton Joyce Pirmary. A disciplinary hearing was told she referred to special needs pupils as 'road kill' and a 'freak show' 

A primary school heateacher referred to special needs pupils as 'road kill' and a 'freak show', a disciplinary hearing has been told.

Margaret Gretton is alleged to have made the remarks as well as racist comments about an Asian job applicant, while head of Burton Joyce Primary in Nottingham.

The panel heard how staff at the school were 'terrified' of Miss Gretton who was sacked from her role following allegations of gross misconduct after initially being suspended in 2012.

At the misconduct hearing of the National College for Teaching and Leaderhip in Coventry, the panel was told how the school was in a state of disrepair.

They also heard how CCTV cameras had been put in place to intimidate staff and that important records, including child protection and staff documents had gone missing from the school.

The three-member panel were also told how she even got rid of tea and coffee making facilities to 'undermine staff' and then tried to claim there would be 'retribution' for her suspension.

Teacher Heidi Stonely, who taught at the school from September 2010 to August 2011, told the hearing how Miss Gretton had a negative attitude when it came to pupils with special needs.

She said: 'In my class, I was teaching a pupil who had learning difficulties and was struggling with her reading and writing.

'The child's family came up in a leadership meeting and it was said her brother left the school without being able to write his name.

'It was said that the only way to talk to him was like a dog and treat him like a dog and Miss Gretton laughed about it.

'Another pupil called a second child 'pom-pom head' and I spoke to the child because it was of a racist nature.

'I reported it to the head and she responded by disciplining the child but then started calling the child "pom-pom head" herself.

'She would use words like horrible, nasty and unkind to describe pupils. I saw her slam the door so hard when yelling at a pupil it shook the walls.

'She also called a special educational needs child a freak show.'

Another teacher at the school, Elizabeth Bashford, described how Miss Gretton mocked colleagues, claiming one left her job after feeling 'victimised and bullied'.

She also claimed the head had been racist about an applicant for a job at the school.

Miss Bashford said: 'A vacancy position came up and Miss Gretton said "why would you send a photo with an application when you look like that?", referring to an Asian/Indian male.

'Then she went on to mock him with an Asian/Indian accent and took the photo next door and continued the mockery in the office.'

The panel also heard from current executive head teacher Philip Palmer.

He said: 'In my experience going into the school, people were identified and then bullied.

'A lot of people told me that they wanted to keep their heads down and stay out of it.

The hearing was also told how Mrs Gretton had CCTV camerasput in place at Burton Joyce Primary, pictured,  to intimidate staff

'From the start it was clear that the staff were terrified of the head and they did not trust me to begin with.

'I have found the whole time I was there disturbing that someone could do so much damage. It has been the most difficult two years of my life.

'I did not know anything about the school until about 7.30am the morning before I started. When I got there the school was in a state of disarray.

'The site manager was absent, the grounds maintenance contract was cancelled and the school was a complete disaster zone to be honest.

'Things like the normal structures you would expect were not there like phone recording systems and the health and safety was disgraceful.

'The office manager was away due to the behaviour of Miss Gretton and she told me that herself.

'Things were in place to undermine the staff like there were no tea or coffee facilities and she only had meetings with team leaders and not the whole cohort.'

The panel also asked Mr Palmer if he had seen the 'Robertson's golliwog' magnets on a filing cabinet.

Burton Joyce Primary School caters fror 350 pupils aged four to 11 and its latest Ofsted inspection rated the school 'inadequate' 

Mr Palmer replied: 'I removed them immediately after noticing them.. They were completely inappropriate.

'There were allegations or recording devices and CCTV cameras put in place also. The staff were compromised and scared to say anything about what was happening.

'The cabinet was empty and the files were not in the school.

'One of the office staff had seen Miss Gretton on camera with her mother taking black bin bags full of something out of the school and into the boot of her car.

'I was told about messages being passed saying that she knew what was going on and that there would be retribution when she comes back.

'The teachers were scared and worried about these messages.'

Allegations against the ex-head teacher related to discriminatory behaviour, inappropriate behaviour towards staff and failure to follow appropriate procedures.

Miss Gretton denies all allegations, but was not present at the hearing.

It will continue into next week, when further members of staff will give evidence and if the allegations are proved against her, she faces being struck off.

Burton Joyce Primary School caters for 350 girls and boys aged four to 11, but in June 2013, the school received a rating of 'inadequate' from Ofsted, the worst possible rating.

This led to Notts County Council stepping in, dissolving the governing body and replacing it with the executive board.

A follow-up monitoring inspection in the autumn showed improvements had been made.
