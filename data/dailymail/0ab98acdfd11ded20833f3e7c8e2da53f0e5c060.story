A 10-year-old girl in Albuquerque has been missing from her home since early on Thursday morning.

By this Friday the FBI, National Guard, trained volunteers, search and rescue, as well as state police are assisting with search of missing Rio Rancho girl Alexandra Greenwall.

Greenwall's mother Catherine said that she put her daughter to bed at 10 p.m. on Wednesday and that's the last time she saw her.

Have you seen her?: Alexandra Greenwall, 10, has been missing from home since early Thursday morning

Alexandra's loving parents said that it appears as though she may have changed her pajamas in the middle of the night and left with two backpacks with a change of clothes, reports Abqjournal.

Catherine told KRQE that her daughter may have run away because they took away some of her stuffed animals when she was misbehaving.

Catherine lives with her husband Lyle, Alexandra’s stepfather, and she believes that Alexandra might be on the way to Madrid to find her previous stepfather whose name has not been released.

She might have taken the train line called  Rail Runner to Madrid, though employees have not reported seeing any children. 

Catherine told reporters that Alexandra's birth father is out of the picture.

Alexandra's other stepfather has returned to Albuquerque to find his daughter.  

Her mother believes that she may just be wandering the neighborhood.

Greenwall has freckles and long dark hair. She may be wearing pink tennis shows and pajamas.

So far the police department has received about 20 tips but there’s no indication as to whether anyone spotted the girl.

'She means the world to us,' said Katherine to reporters who met her outside her home.

'We are confident she's coming home.' 

Catherine and Lyle said they are not ready to make any further comments to the press other than tell them useful information so that they may find their daughter
