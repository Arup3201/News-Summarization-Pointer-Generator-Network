The Irish accent is the most popular in Britain, a survey revealed yesterday.

More than a quarter of people questioned said they prefer listening to a soft Irish lilt to any other manner of speech and women were particularly keen on the accent.

Those polled found the least attractive was the Essex 
accent, popularised by the stars of The Only Way Is Essex such as Amy 
Childs, Mark Wright and Gemma Collins and it scored just ONE per cent.

The Irish accent is the most popular in Britain. Women were particularly keen with many saying they enjoy listening to the words of singer Danny O' Donoghue (left) and One Direction's Niall Horan (right)

The West Country accent used by TV 
presenter Justin Lee Collins and comedian Russell Howard came second 
with nearly a fifth of the vote (19 per cent).

The Geordie accent from the north-east -
popularised by TV hosts Ant and Dec and singer Cheryl Cole - came third
with 17 per cent.

The Birmingham accent, spoken by 
comedian Frank Skinner and rock musician Ozzy Osbourne came second to 
bottom . Only two per cent confessed it was their favourite.

The survey, conducted by online casino RoxyPalace.com, asked 1000 people to name their favourite accent.

A spokesman for Roxy Palace said a person's preference could be down to both upbringing and celebrity preference.

1. Irish - 28 per cent
2. West Country - 19 per cent
3. Geordie - 17 per cent
4. Mancunian - 11 per cent
5. Glaswegian - 8 per cent
6. Scouse - 6 per cent
7. Yorkshire - 5 per cent
8. Welsh - 3 per cent
9. Brummie - 2 per cent
10. Essex - 1 per cent

He said: 'We all grow up thinking we 
don't have an accent and it is not until others from a different part of
the country point it out that we realise that we do.

'Therefore, it is no surprise that none of those polled said they felt their own accent was the least attractive.

'We also found that many people choose which accents they prefer based on who their favourite celebrities are at the time.

'So, without TOWIE, maybe the Essex accent would have performed better.

He added that it was little surprise that the Irish accent topped the poll.

Â He said: 'It is melodic, out of the ordinary and has something of the loveable rogue quality to it.

'The biggest surprise was that of the West Country accent - viewed as sounding rural by some - scoring so highly.'
