The probably thought that the faded fresco needed a lick of paint.

Unfortunately, it would appear a company was a little too zealous in sprucing up this ancient art work, and have left it completely unrecognisable.

Now two officials in China have been sacked after centuries-old Buddhist frescos were ruined in the 'unauthorised restoration' work.

A company has 'restored' the ancient Buddhist frescos in Yunjie Temple by painting them over with cartoon-like figures

The faded and peeling paintings were inside a 270-year-old temple in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, which is nearly 400 miles north of Beijing.

Years after it was created the intricate fresco, which dated back to the early period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), was left with only hints of its former glory, with large pieces scratched away and only scraps of colour left.

But they have now been completely painted over with cartoon-like Taoist figures in garish colours.

The crude characters are dressed in pinks, greens, yellows and blues and bear no resemblance to the former painting that was in the Chaoyang temple.

Figures swaddled in robes can be seen riding ponies, mythical beasts and elephants.

Wispy clouds appear on bright blue backgrounds, while flowers fall from baskets and sprout up from nowhere.

An official responsible for temple affairs and who the man oversees the cultural heritage monitoring team have been sacked over the affair, the Global Times reported, according to the BBC.

The Communist Party chief of the office responsible for the scenic area surrounding the temple has also been given a warning, the paper quoted city official Li Haifeng as saying, the Daily Telegraph reported.

The botched restoration was exposed by a blogger  who posted photos of the 'restored' frescos online and compared them with the originals.

Ren Xiuqi, an official responsible for the management of the Phoenix Mountain where the temple is located, said 'inspection and law enforcement' teams had been dispatched to the temple to prevent further damage.

It is unknown whether the company responsible for the botched restoration had the 'relevant qualifications'.

The incident bears a strong resemblance to the case of the Ecce Homo, when a grandmother decided to do a little DIY on a historic painting of Jesus Christ in a Spanish church. 

However, her efforts ended up being likened to a crayon sketch of a very hairy monkey.

But the 82-year-old artist accused of ruining the 1910 depiction of Christ called Ecce Homo has had the last laugh.

The fresco became such a massive tourist attraction at the Misericordia Church in Borja, north eastern Spain, officials began charging people one euro to look at the piece of art.

Just one year on, the church has made £57,000 from ticket sales which has been used to improve the building and cover other costs.

Artist Cecilia Gimenez has also came to an agreement with the foundation over image rights.
