An airport baggage handler who was fired for refusing to load a sick and starving dog onto a plane has been offered her job back after news of her dismissal prompted a national outcry.

Lynn Jones was fired from Reno-Tahoe International Airport last month after breaking down in tears and refusing to obey her supervisor, fearing the emaciated animal would not survive the flight.

But after news of her sacking spread, hundreds of supporters bombarded airport bosses with angry phone calls and emails demanding that she should be rehired.

Now Airport Terminal Services the private company who employed her for more than five years, has offered her old job back, complete with back pay.

The firm's president Sally Leible claims she regretted the way the incident was handled and that she hoped Ms Jones would come back to work.

Ms Leible said she now believes that Ms Jones 'was trying to protect the dog'

She added: 'I think she was courageous in doing that.

'I really, truly hope she will come back."

Ms Lieble said the company would use the incident as a learning tool to educate workers at the 38 U.S. airports ATS serves and renew the company's commitment to recognize and report animal abuse of any form.

However as of Tuesday night, Ms Jones had not accepted the job offer, Leible said.

A statement on ATS's website read: 
'ATS takes this situation extremely seriously and commends this 
employee's situational awareness and her desire to raise the concern on 
behalf of the canine involved.'

The firm has also pledged to contribute an unspecified amount of 
money to the Nevada Humane Society over the next three years.

Ms Jones, of Lockwood, said her supervisor had ordered her to load the pointer dog lying in a pet carrier because the its paperwork was in order and its condition wasn't her concern.

She said at the time: 'The dog was so weak and torn up. It didn't look like it could survive the flight. I was crying. I kept saying that dog could not be put on a plane.'

'Everybody who saw it, the ATS people, the airport police officers, the girls at the ticket counter, was concerned.

Ms Jones said she was then fired on the spot, adding: '[My supervisor] kept yelling, "That's it, you're done, you are out of here, go home".'

She says her employers deactivated her security badge and refused to return her phone calls.

The airport police phoned Washoe County Regional Animal Services, who took custody of the animal which is owned by a hunter who, according to authorities, has it shipped to places he hunts.

It was allowed to fly three days later and was taken back to Texas.

Ms Jones added: 'I just couldn't turn my back on that dog. My supervisor said it wasn't my concern, but animal abuse is everyone's concern who sees it.'

Krys Bart, CEO of the Reno-Tahoe Airport Authority - who is also on the board of directors of the Nevada Humane Society said she was proud of how airport police intervened.

She said: 'In all my years here, this is the first time I'm thoroughly disgusted over what I understand to be the situation this animal was put in.

'They (officers) had an affirmative responsibility to deal with this, and that's what they did,' Ms Bart said.

Speaking on Monday Ms Jones said that she didn't know what she would do if offered her old job back.

She said: 'I would have to really think about it.'
