Two men were sentenced Wednesday over an online video that shows one of them jumping onto two manatees.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Orlando reports that 22-year-old Taylor Blake Martin was ordered to pay a $3,000 fine, while 22-year-old Seth Andrew Stephenson must pay $2,000. 

Both men were sentenced to two years probation and must also serve 175 hours of community service. Martin and Stephenson were also ordered to individually post 'an apology and a statement of remorse' on Facebook

The men each pleaded guilty in March to taking or harassing an endangered species.

Cruel: Two Florida men face a year in prison after pleading guilty to luring manatees with a hose so one could jump on them

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
officials began investigating last year after the video was posted on 
Facebook.

The video shows one man, identified by prosecutors as 
Stephenson, luring two manatees to a dock on a Cocoa Beach canal with a 
water hose.

Another another man, identified as Martin, jumped off the dock, 'cannonballing' an adult manatee and a calf.

Manatees are protected by both state and federal laws.

The
 'cannonballing' occurred in March of 2012 and was posted online which is how 
authorities learned of the incident

.U.S. Magistrate Judge Gregory Kelly said he was troubled that Martin and Stephenson targeted and harassed the manatees for their own entertainment.

'What concerns me is your callous disregard for a protected species,' Kelly said.

He noted that if the manatees were killed or if there was evidence the animals were injured, the men would have been facing prison time.

The 50-second video shows Stephenson 
using a freshwater hose to lure the adult manatee and a calf over to a 
dock. The man behind the camera then encourages Martin to jump on them.

Martin then jumps right on the backs of the endangered animals as his friends cheer him on.

The video was then posted on Facebook, where it was discovered by a local news outlet, which broadcasted it on television.

When authorities saw the video, they quickly identified the men responsible for it began developing a case against them.

Gentle giants: Manatees are mammals who typically eat sea grass and freshwater vegetation. They are large, aquatic relatives of elephants

The poorly written post read 'in my debue [sic] as tayla the manatee slaya … and im [expletive] ready to cannonball on every manatee liveing [sic].'

Manatees are protected by the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act, which makes it illegal to injure, harm, capture or attempt to capture a manatee in Florida.

The enormous, friendly mammals are also called sea cows.

As Florida's inlets and coastal canals have become more populated with power boats, manatees - which often swim near the surface of the water - have been the unintended victims of countless run-ins with propellers of power boats, which has led to their inclusion on the endangered species list.
