A Swedish man who was inspired by a Londoner’s attempt to outrun a Tube train has filmed his own challenge against an equally formidable opponent – a city bus.

With a miniature camera attached to his body, Michael Jonsson set out to determine once and for all whether he could beat a bus as it travelled from one stop to another in the municipality of Sundbyberg, just north of Stockholm.

The video shows Michael stepping off the bus and then dashing off in a mad sprint as he attempts to score another point for humans in the battle against machines.

And they're off! Michael Jonsson sprints along a road as he tries to beat a bus to its next stop

While the bus takes its regular route, Michael takes a shortcut as he runs over a footbridge, through a park and a car park – covering a distance of over half a mile in four-and-a-half minutes.

In the end, it was a virtual tie as an exhausted Michael walks onto the bus moments after it pulls up to the stop.

But the bus driver and passengers don’t seem to care or notice that the man who exited at the last stop was joining them again. 

The 28-year-old, who works as a system developer at a technology company in Stockholm, told The Local that he planning to take on Stockholm’s metro system in an attempt to copy the feat of James Heptonstall.

The 30-year-old Londoner wowed Tube passengers when he raced a Circle Line train – and won.

With a miniature camera strapped to his head, he exited at Mansion House and made it back onto the train at Cannon Street.
