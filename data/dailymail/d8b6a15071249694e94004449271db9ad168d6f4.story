Actor Timothy Spall spent two years studying art to prepare for his role as J.M.W. Turner in a film about the famous artist.

And now, the film star's replication of Turner, carried out under the tutorship of London artist Tim Wright, will form part of an exhibition next year.

The culmination of his training was a full-size copy of Turner's Snow Storm - Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth Making Signals in Shallow Water, and Going by the Lead from 1842, which will be on show at the exhibition.

It will take place at Petworth House, in Sussex, where Turner was regularly a guest and painted in the grounds. 

It will also feature some of Spall's London landscapes and life drawings.

Spall, 57, who played Winston Churchill in the King's Speech, was trained by Mr Wright, who devised a 24-month programme which included a study of the 'basics', before moving on to Turner's style, as well as trips to the Tate Gallery to study the painter's archive.

Mr Wright told the Independent: 'I quickly realised he was the sort of person who was going to be responsive and intrigued by the subject.

Wright said that though Spall had no real training, he did have an interest in art and was 'obsessed' by Turner

Mr Spall worked tirelessly in order to ensure his portrayal of the artist J.M.W. Turner was as complete as possible. Above, the actor in a scene from the film

'He had an interest in art as well – no real training but he was certainly interested in Turner, obsessed by Turner.'

Wright added: 'There are things that are very difficult but he was very tenacious. He never cut corners and was very diligent – it was quite impressive to see.'

Snow Storm was the final project before the shooting of the film and supposedly shows a boat called Ariel struggling in a violent storm at Harwick. Turner, by some accounts, was present at the scene.

Spall said: 'You always spend a lot of time working on a character, but preparing for Mr Turner is the most I've ever done'

'We tried to follow Turner's technique all the way through the process of painting. That's quite a successful piece', said Mr Wright.  

Spall said: 'You always spend a lot of time working on a character, but preparing for Mr Turner is the most I’ve ever done.'  

Mr. Turner, written and directed by Mike Leigh, is released in the UK on 31 October and the US on December 19. 

The exhibition at Petworth House runs until March 11, 2015.
