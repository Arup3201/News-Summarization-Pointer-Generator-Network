House Speaker John Boehner seemed to nudge the U.S. one step closer to putting those elusive 'boots on the ground' in the Middle East on Sunday, saying that President Obama will ultimately have to deploy ground forces to fight ISIS if no other country steps up to do it. 

'We have no choice,' Boehner said. 'These are barbarians. They intend to kill us. And if we don't destroy them first, we're gonna pay the price.' 

General Lord Richards, a legendary British military leader who was chief of the defence staff until last year, agrees. He said Sunday that 'the only way to defeat ISIS is to take back land they are occupying, which means a conventional military operation.'

'The only way to do it effectively is to use western armies,' Richards told the Sunday Times, 'but I understand the political resistance.'

House Speaker John Boehner told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos on Sunday that the US will have no choice but to deploy ground troops in the Middle East if no other countries step up

President Barack Obama said Sunday on CBS that his intelligence services had underestimated ISIS, but insisted that Arab nations would ultimately band together and fight the way he doesn't want to

Obama has pursued a strategy of targeted airstrikes coupled with Special Forces on the ground in small numbers, hoping to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' ISIS, which styles itself as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham.

The president has also worked with Congress to fund a 'train and equip' program in the hope of whipping the small Free Syrian Army into fighting shape.

Lord Richards, the former UK defence staff chief, said a 'conventional military operation' will be the only way to defeat ISIS

That's a process that military observers say could take a year and yield only 5,000 fighters at the outset.

ISIS can field an army of up to 31,000, according to intelligence reports.

Boehner said on ABC's 'This Week' program that 'if the goal is to destroy ISIS, as the president says it is, I don't believe the strategy that he outlined will accomplish that.'

'At the end of the day, I think it's gonna take more than airstrikes to drive them outta there,' he said. 'At some point, somebody's boots have to be on the ground. That's the whole point.'

'And maybe we can get enough of these forces trained to get ‘em on the battlefield,' the speaker mused. 'But somebody's boots have to be there.' 

Richards criticized Obama's plan to rely on airstrikes to scatter the ISIS army.

'Ultimately you need a land army to achieve the objectives we’ve set ourselves,' he said. 'All air [strikes] will do is destroy elements of ISIS; it won’t achieve our strategic goal.'

Similarly, the retired general told The Australian on Monday, paying close attention to ISIS only in Iraq is a counterproductive strategy. 

'You can't possibly defeat ISIS by only attacking them in Iraq,' he said. 'How the hell can you win the war when most of your enemy can end up in a country you can’t get involved in?'

'Even if you are successful in Iraq, which I doubt, they will just go into Syria, and what will you have achieved? They will just have tighter lines of communication.' 

Boehner chided the president for telegraphing the shrinking size of his tactical toolbox by repeatedly pledging not to deploy U.S. troop divisions into Syria or Iraq.

'If I were the president, I probably wouldn't have talked about what I wouldn't do,' Boehner insisted.

He said he would call Congress back into session immediately if the White House proposed a new Authorization for Use of Military Force. Obama is relying on an 11-year-old AUMF, aimed at al-Qaeda, to prosecute his war against ISIS.

'I think he does have the authority to do it,' Boehner said, 'but the point I'm making is this is a proposal the Congress ought to consider.'

Telegraphing moves: Boehner said that 'if I were the president, I probably wouldn't have talked about what I wouldn't do'

'The president typically in a situation like this would call for an authorization vote, and go sell that to the American people and send a resolution to [Capitol] Hill,' he told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos.

'The president has not done that.'

Appearing on 'Fox News Sunday,' Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barasso said the president 'has an obligation to call us back tomorrow to start this debate.'

But, he claimed, Democrats in Congress are resisting the idea of having to take a stand on going to war in the weeks leading up to an election. 

'I don't think Harry Reid wants this debate or the vote,' Barasso said, but 'I think we have an obligation.'

'The prime minister of Britain called the Parliament back,' he noted.

'No member of Congress should be left off the hook.'
