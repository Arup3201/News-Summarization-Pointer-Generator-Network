The European Union has told Spain its plans to impose a 50 euro charge on anyone crossing the Gibraltar border would be illegal - hours after Downing Street refused to rule out tit-for-tat measures if the row over the territory is not resolved quickly.

EU spokesman Olivier Bailly said the entry tax suggested by Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo was not official but that 'any tax or fees imposed at the border of a member state will be illegal under EU law'.

His comments come as three Royal Navy ships, led by frigate HMS Westminster, arrived at Gibraltar a day after more than 40 commercial Spanish boats staged a protest over a controversial reef which sparked the disagreement and led to retaliatory delays at the border.

It has been reported that UK officials are examining the potential to disrupt Spain's lucrative tourist industry as well as blocking its policy initiatives at the EU.

Diplomatic incident: A spokesman for Number 10 declined to rule out retaliatory political action against Spain if the row is not resolved quickly

Pressed repeatedly on the potential 
for such action, a Number 10 spokesman told reporters: 'Our preference 
here is to resolve this via political means and through dialogue with 
the Spanish government.

'We
clearly want to reach a quick resolution which is acceptable and brings
an end to these totally disproportionate border checks.'

Asked if David Cameron was confident of securing a swift resolution, he said: 'We will do what we need to do to bring this to a satisfactory conclusion.'

Provocative: The HMS Westminster arrived in the harbour at Gibraltar this morning for what authorities insist are long-planned exercises

Long-scheduled exercises: The Navy warship is seen sailing into the harbour with the Rock of Gibraltar visible in the background

Type 23 
frigate HMS Westminster is now in Gibraltar along with the Royal Fleet 
Auxiliary ships Mounts Bay and Lyme Bay for a scheduled visit ahead of 
the Cougar '13 exercises in the Mediterranean.

Cougar
'13 is a long-planned deployment involving four Royal Navy warships, 
the lead commando group from 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines and 
elements of naval air squadrons.

The operation also includes the helicopter carrier HMS Illustrious and the navy's flagship HMS Bulwark.

Warm greeting: Gibraltarians waved Union flags this morning as HMS Westminister sailed into the harbour

War ship: The HMS Westminster, seen leaving Portsmouth bound for Gibraltar, was spotted approaching the Rock at about 7.15am this morning

Protest: Spanish fishermen staged a protest yesterday at the site of an artificial reef built in Algeciras Bay, which they say ruins traditional fishing grounds

Row: A fleet of 38 Spanish fishing boats sailed towards Gibraltar yesterday to demand the British outpost remove 70 concrete blocks it has dropped in their fishing grounds

A
Spanish Guardia Civil patrol boat passed close to the military area of 
Gibraltar harbour not long after HMS Westminster arrived this morning.

The Spanish boat passed outside the harbour walls in Gibraltar Bay before speeding off when a police launch approached it.

Yesterday's
protest prompted calls for renewed efforts, involving the European 
Union, to solve the diplomatic dispute which has seen Madrid introduce 
additional checks at the border in protest, leaving workers and tourists
facing hours in queues to get through.

The Number 10 spokesman said the Prime Minister wanted the EU to send monitors to the border 'urgently'.

'We
are still actively pursuing legal action. If we do pursue it, the first
step would be for the European Commission to investigate the issue. 
That is why the Prime Minister spoke to President (Jose Manuel) Barroso.'
