The U.S. may not have come out on top in the team free skating competition on Sunday but you wouldn't be able to tell that from the look on skater Gracie Gold's face.

After nailing all 11 jumps in her long program, the 18-year-old scored 129.36 - a personal best and enough to put her in second place on the individual level.

Her score also helped carry the U.S. to third place overall in the first year a team event has been included in the Olympic Games.

After the successful routine, Gold pumped her fist in victory and broke out in smiles.

USA: Gold's stellar performance was enough to carry the U.S. team to third place overall

Relief: Gold breathes out after her impressive long program. She scored only second to Russian phenom Julia Lipnitskaia

Look out: While the U.S. team may have come up short in earning a gold medal in the team competition, Gold's performance was a good omen for what's to come in the individual competition

Golden girl: This was the first year there has been a team skating event at the Olympics

Medal-winners: The U.S. team placed third overall in the team skating competition. Russia took the gold and Canada the silver

Gearing up: Gold will return to Austria with her coach to prepare for the individual competition set to start in nine days

Gold's earnest elation marked quite a contrast to teammate Ashley Wagner's reaction to her short-program score yesterday.

Wagner came off the rink smiling as well, certain that she had just placed at the very top of the competition.

But when the scores were read out, she placed fourth and wasn't impressed. Her smile turned to a frown of disgust and she turned to someone near her and said 'b******'.

'I know roughly when I skate a good 
program where the score should end up... So yeah to score that low was 
very disappointing for me,' she said afterwards.

Wagner may feel that she's got something to prove after her selection over Mirai Nagasu sparked a backlash on social media.

Nagasu
 finished third at the National Championships in Boston last month while
 Wagner finished in fourth place, yet it was she who was selected to the
 Winter Olympic team.

'It was on my mind with the media 
frenzy over the last couple of weeks that I needed to prove to myself 
and everybody else that has even doubted my belonging here that I am 
here to compete, to be competitive,' she told Yahoo.

Her score, however, was enough to 
advance the U.S. team from seventh to third place, meaning they will be 
one of the top five teams to advance through to the finals on Sunday 
night.

It was the Russian team with star 
15-year-old Julia Lipnitskaya and veteran men's skater Evgeny 
Plushenko that were the undisputed winners of the competition.

Lipnitskaya pulled off such an impressive long program that she scored 12 points more than second-place Gold.

That performance helped the Russians win their first gold medal of the Olympics, and it made Lipnitskaya the youngest figure skater in 78 years to win the top prize.

Lipnitskaya's performance was so monumental that even Gold could hold back praise.

Together: The Russians won the first gold medal of the games in the team skating competition

Jaw-dropping: 15-year-old Russian Julia Lipnitskaia wowed the audience and judges with her stellar long program, which put her 12 points above Gold

He's still got it: Despite being older than most of the figure skating competition, 31-year-old Yevgeni Plushenko pulled off a solid performance, contributing to the Russian victory

Questions: However, there are rumors that Plushenko will pull out of his individual competitions because of a hurt back

'She's dynamite, guys,' Gold said. 'She's completely unfazed. She has no spine, but she has iron in her bones. She goes "Ding, ding, ding. I'm not tired."'

Also pivotal to the Russian team's success was the aging Plushenko whom many thought didn't have it in him to be a competitor in his fourth Olympic Games.

Despite largely not competing since the Vancouver Olympics, Plushenko pulled off a solid performance, scoring 162.20.

'It is amazing the longevity that he has had ... To do what he does here at that age after so many years coming back without much competition experience this season, I have a lot of respect for him,' said Kevin Reynolds, the Canadian skater who came in second place to Plushenko.

Overall, there were good feelings between the fiercely competitive U.S. and Russian teams. After the Russian win on Sunday, President Vladimir Putin walked up to the American skaters to congratulate them on their performance.
