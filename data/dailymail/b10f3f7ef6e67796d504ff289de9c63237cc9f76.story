Two-year-old Grayson Bays, who has autism, cried when he was getting his hair cut on Saturday, prompting the owner of the salon to shout at his mom

A woman who witnessed a salon owner berate a mother and her autistic toddler who was acting up during a haircut has caused uproar on social-media platforms creating a backlash against the owner and her salon.

Vanessa Hunt, 29, claims she saw Michelle Mott, owner of M Spa Salon in Portage, Michigan give ‘a severe tongue lashing’ to Ashley Bays and her two-year-old son Grayson, who has autism, in the middle of the busy salon on Saturday.

Hunt was so upset by the incident, that she wrote about the experience on her Facebook page the next day and asked others to share the story.

Since she posted her recollection of the incident on Sunday evening, her comment have been shared more than 30,000 times.

According to Hunt’s post, she and a friend were visiting the salon to get manicures.

She
said a toddler was crying while getting a haircut when she witnessed 
the owner of the salon, Michelle Mott, give the mother ‘a severe tongue 
lashing’ and tell her ‘how inappropriate her son's behavior was.’

The mother left with her son, followed by the hair stylist who was cutting the young boy's hair.

‘It was seriously painful to watch,’ Hunt wrote on Facebook.

‘At the conclusion of this woman's tantrum, the mother said through tears, “I'm so sorry, he's autistic.”

Vanessa Hunt has caused uproar on social-media platforms after posting on Facebook about the unpleasant incident she witnessed at a Michigan salon on Saturday

'I
walked outside to see the hairstylist finishing the little boy's 
haircut on the lawn – The mom, still crying and cradling her precious 
son. We hugged her and cried with her too. It was so awful to see this.’

Hunt’s
emotional post has generated a fierce backlash of popular opinion 
against the salon, which was forced to remove its own Facebook site on 
Monday. 

Angered by the
owner's apparent heartlessness, people have taken to review sites such 
as Yelp.com and Yahoo.com to express their unhappiness at the salon 
owner’s behavior.

A 
Facebook page calling for a boycott of M Spa has sprung up in the wake 
of the incident and quickly attracted more than 7,000 followers.

The mom at the center of the incident has also spoken out about her experience.

Ashley Bays, 28, said she and her family are in shock about how they were treated by salon-owner Mott.

‘I’ve never experienced anything else
like this before. I understand if she doesn’t want children in the 
salon, but she could have handled it a lot differently,’ Bays told MLive. ‘She could have pulled us to the side. She was very insensitive that he does have special needs.’

Bays said she has been a regular at the salon for many years and her been taking her son with her for the past 18 months.

‘This
wasn’t the first time he acted that way at her salon and she was 
yelling at us the whole time (Saturday) in front of the staff and 
clientele,’ she Bays, whose husband, Josh, and their younger son, 
Wesley, were also present during the incident.

Witnesses claim that Michelle Mott, owner of M Spa Salon in Portage, Michigan give 'a severe tongue lashing' to Ashley Bays and her two-year-old son Grayson on Saturday

While Bays said she had not met Mott before Saturday, she said the stylist cutting Grayson's hair she had informed Mott previously that the boy has autism.

Bays said she apologized to Mott during the incident, telling her more than once that her son has autism.

‘When I told Michelle, “I'm sorry, he's autistic,” she said, “I know,"’ Bays said. ‘She confirmed to me she was aware.’

Bays said Mott ‘wouldn’t stop yelling.’

‘So I took that as we needed to leave,’ Bays said. 

M Spa has been forced to take down its Facebook page, while a page calling for a boycott of the spa has sprung up and already attracted more than 7,000 followers

The entire family went outside where the stylist finished the haircut.

On Tuesday afternoon, Mott issued a statement about the incident through her lawyer.

‘A circumstance which arose with a young patron on Saturday, May 25, 2013 has drawn significant community and media attention due to inaccurate Facebook postings,’ said the statement issued by lawyer George Perrett.

‘This young child was a prior customer at the spa. Yet, on this occasion, spa ownership addressed a situation which posed both an immediate, increasing safety concern to the child and a concern for other spa patrons.’

The statement said that, under the circumstances, ‘M-Spa handled this matter appropriately.’

Meanwhile Hunt, who had described the incident as ‘seriously painful to watch,’ she has been shocked at the power of social media to bring public attention to something.

'I didn’t know social media had this kind of power,' she told MLive. 'This was nothing I ever imagined.'
