Thomas ‘Slab’ Murphy, the former IRA chief of staff, is thought to have been tipped off just hours before a major cross-border police raid.

Authorities believe that Murphy and his associates knew about the raid and allegedly destroyed computers and documents before the Garda pounced last Wednesday morning.

A number of large fires were seen close to Murphy’s home in Ballybinaby, County Louth, at around 2am that day and, salvaged from the embers, were the burnt remains of laptops, documents and computer disks.

'Tipped-off': Thomas 'Slab' Murphy and his associates are thought to have known about a major cross-border police raid hours before the Garda arrived at his house and more than 22 homes and business premises

Sixty-year-old Murphy, who was named under privilege as an IRA chief of staff during a Smithwick Tribunal in 2011, was questioned but not arrested shortly after the raid as he drove away from his home, which is just six feet inside the border.

At 6am, Operation Loft got underway as SWAT teams from the Garda Emergency Response Unit and the PSNI surrounded Murphy’s home, along with Air Corps and British Army helicopters. Led by the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in Dublin, a team of 300 have been involved in the investigation into the illegal fuel trade which has seen searches in 11 countries.

In the raid of over 22 homes and business premises, more than €100,000 in cash and a huge number of documents were seized.

One of the largest suspected diesel laundering plants ever discovered was also found. The Irish Independent reported that the plant could produce more than €5million worth of illegal fuel a year. Some 40,000 litres of fuel was also found at the premises.

On raid day: A number of large fires were seen close to Murphy's home in Ballybinaby on the day of the raid and police salvaged the burnt remains of laptops, documents and computer disks

The investigation has found that a reported €100million had been generated and laundered in the last 18 months alone from the sale of laundered diesel, through an intricate network of bank accounts in made-up names. More than €1.6million in bank accounts in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Britain and Europe has been frozen already.

The Belfast Telegraph quoted a source saying: 'This investigation has been ongoing for several years.

'It is just like a jigsaw and the final pieces in that puzzle are now being put in place.'

The fuel laundering operation sells laundered diesel which has had its colour marker washed out in order to avoid VAT payments.

In a statement the Criminal Assets Bureau said: ‘This illegal activity has knock on effects on legitimate businesses as well as on unsuspecting customers who have very often experienced damage to the fuel system of their vehicles (from laundered diesel) or poor return per litre of petrol.’

Concerned by compromise: One of the tankers removed from Murphy's house after the raid but authorities are said to be worried about a possible 'tip-off' which allowed evidence to be destroyed before the early morning raid

Authorities are said to be 'very concerned' by the prospect of their operation having been compromised, a security source was reported saying in the Irish Independent. The source said: ‘They seemed to know that a raid was imminent but they now have to explain why this burning took place.

It is expected that the amount of money frozen will rise dramatically as the investigation continues and more accounts are discovered, it was reported.

In a separate case, Murphy is currently facing nine allegations of failing to file income tax returns from 1996 to 2004 before the Special Criminal Court and his family is also contesting a €5million tax bill from the CAB.
