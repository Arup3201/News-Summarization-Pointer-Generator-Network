Muammar Gaddafi was already seen as a rather odd personality, but it was still a surprise to learn about his bizarre video made for Condi Rice.

The former U.S. Secretary of State has revealed more details about their strange relationship and a music video he made for a sing called ‘Black Flower in the White House’ and presented as a gift.

She said her colleagues had already warned her about the late Libyan leader’s fascination with her before she went to visit him in 2008.

‘When I got there I thought "just get through your business, just do diplomacy, just get out of here",’ she told the Daily Show with Jon Stewart.

'Everything was going fine and then all of sudden he said: “I have this video for you”. And I thought: “Uh oh, what is this?”.’

It turned out that he had compiled a photo montage of her, including images of her with other world leaders like Chinese president Hu Jintao and former Russian president Vladimir Putin.

This was set to a song Colonel Gaddafi had written for her called ‘Black Flower in the White House.’

Asked to sing a few lines, Rice politely declined, describing the ballad as ‘kind of hard to sing’.

A bizarre photograph album filled page to page with pictures of Condoleezza Rice was found at Gaddafi's compound in August.

Colonel Gaddafi had previously hinted at a serious admiration for her in an interview with Al-Jazeera television in 2007, where he hinted that then-President George W. Bush's top diplomat wielded considerable influence in the Arab world.

'I support my darling black African woman,' he said at the time. 'I admire and am very proud of the way she leans back and gives orders to the Arab leaders. ... Leezza, Leezza, Leezza. ...

'I love her very much. I admire her, and I'm proud of her, because she's a black woman of African origin.'

He was able to meet her and present his musical gift the next year.

On the Daily Show Ms Rice added she was ‘really glad’ he 
gave up his weapons of mass destruction because she has ‘no doubt he 
would have used them’.

Earlier this week she revealed the moment she thought that she and President George W. Bush had suffered deadly botulism poisoning.

'Everything was going fine and then all of sudden he said: “I have this video for you”. And I thought: "Uh oh, what is this?"'

Condoleezza Rice

In the weeks after 9/11, there were scares over smallpox and radioactive attacks on Washington  - and a potential poisonous toxin attack, she said.

She was on a trip to a summit meeting in China with Mr Bush when former vice president Dick Cheney delivered the blow via a video conference line.

For Ms Rice and her colleagues on the trip, including Mr Bush, Secretary of State Colin Powell and Chief of Staff Andy Card, they were all at risk.

The samples were sent to the disease officials for tests on laboratory mice and took an anxious 24 hours to come back. They were negative.

Ms Rice’s new book gives insights into the former secretary of state's eight years serving at the top level of government.

It features flashbacks on how the U.S. tried to revolutionise its security after 9/11 and the terror fears that followed those attacks.

She reveals Mr Bush’s presidential team often seriously fell out over how to protect the U.S. after 9/11.
