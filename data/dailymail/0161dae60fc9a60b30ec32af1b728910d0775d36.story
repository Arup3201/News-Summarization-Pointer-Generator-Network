Scott Quigg successfully defended his WBA super-bantamweight world title for the fifth time against Hidenori Ohtake who suffered his first defeat in seven years.

Quigg was taken the distance by the Japanese visitor in Liverpool on Saturday night, winning almost every round in what was a workmanlike victory.

The 26-year-old from Bury will now hope his promoter Eddie Hearn can deliver a career-defining unification clash against Carl Frampton or Leo Santa Cruz when he returns to the ring in March.

Ohtake was fighting outside of Japan for the first time in his career but his only defeat came on points over five rounds in 2007. He had also never faced anyone with a losing record.

But Quigg looked to take control from the first bell as he targeted the body, looking for one of his trademark finishes.

In the second round, a right hook upstairs wobbled Ohtake who stumbled backwards but was able to see out the remainder of the three-minute session.

Neither man was prepared to give an each as the fight continued on the inside in the third round with Ohtake matching the champion punch for punch.

Quigg continued to land his right hook to the head in rounds three and four but they proved to be brief successes rather than sustained attacks.

With limited footage of the visiting Ohtake available, Quigg had gone into the fight slightly hampered but there was little doubt that the Japanese challenger was made of strong stuff.

It wasn't until the eighth round that Quigg was able to find the room to let his hands go but Ohtake stood up to the onslaught.

Ohtake had suffered a cut above his right eye which the referee had the ringside doctor check in the tenth stanza but she cleared him to continue.

The officials went through the same procedure in the penultimate round but Ohtake soldiered on, despite the blood running down his face and withstood a fierce left hook on the bell.

Ohtake rallied in the final session, knowing he needed a knockout to win but was unable to land the telling blow.

All three judges gave Quigg the nod, by scores of 119-109 twice and 118-110.

Quigg said: 'I tell you what, I know his head is tough, I tried to pour on the gas at the end and landed some great combinations but he wasn't going nowhere and fair play to him, but 12 rounds is never a bad thing to get under your belt.'
