Settling into a new culture and country can be tough and it appears Ashley Cole could be struggling to adapt in Italy.

The left-back, who signed for AS Roma on a free transfer in July, was left on the periphery in the squad photo, some way away from the rest of the squad and his misfortune has gone viral.

In fact the former Chelsea star humored some by replying to a few of the posts left on his Twitter account.
