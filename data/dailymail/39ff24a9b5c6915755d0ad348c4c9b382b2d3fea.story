Tradition: The sound of the Bow Bells is said to give the area within which true Cockneys are born

Tradition dictates that only those born within earshot of the 'Bow Bells' can claim to be  Cockneys.

But it seems that the ranks of these 'true' Londoners are dwindling - because noise pollution is
drowning out the sound of the bells of St Mary-le-Bow church.

As the street noise in the capital increases every year, the area in 
which the peeling of the bells can be heard has been gradually reduced.

The phenomenon is considered so serious by church officials that they 
have backed plans to give the Bow Bells an audio boost with an MP3 
recording of their sound.

Around 150 years ago they could be heard across the City, Islington, 
Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Southwark and even parts of Camden and Waltham 
Forest.

They now can only be heard in a small area in the City and Shoreditch.

And the study into the bells' sound revealed there are no maternity wards within earshot of St Mary-le-Bow.

But now internet users can listen to the bells in the online download - as 
researchers aim for their sound to be heard more widely.

A study undertaken to coincide with the 
new Times Atlas of London found that in 1851, noise levels in the 
capital were similar to that of Britain's countryside today.

Would you Adam and Eve it? True Cockneys like the Trotters could have their days numbered due the lessened influence of the Bow Bells and the rise of other dialects

While sound levels were around 20 to 25 DBA in the evening, ambient levels now measure around 55 DBA.

Researchers said it was due to a combination of road and aircraft noise pollution.

Describing the MP3 soundtrack which it is hoped will keep the Cockney tradition alive, Reverend George Bush of St Mary-le-Bow church said: 'There are hundreds of thousands of people of Cockney descent across the world, from Australia to Canada, the United States to South Africa, and I hope that they will enjoy hearing the chimes that were so very familiar to their ancestors.

'Perhaps this digital initiative will help create a new generation of global Cockneys, and, if so, I hope that in the years to come they will have the opportunity to visit London and hear the remarkable sound of Bow Bells in person.'

In the 14th century the term Cockney 
was used by rural people to native Londoners who relied on their wits 
rather than their strength. By the 16th century it suggested a lack of 
masculinity.

In time the term became synonymous 
with working class Londoners and it lost its negative connotations, but 
is occasionjally still used disparagingly by those in the North to 
describe all Londoners.

The reference to the Bow Bells appeared around 1600 in Fynes Moryson's 
'An Itinerary' that said: 'Londoners, and all within the sound of Bow 
Bells, are in reproach called Cockneys.'

Lexicographer John Minsheu was the first to define it in this sense. In 
his Ductor in Linguas (1617) he wrote: 'A Cockney or Cockny, applied 
only to one born within the sound of Bow bell, that is in the City of 
London.'
