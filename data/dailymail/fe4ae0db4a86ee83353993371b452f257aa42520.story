There's nothing quite like mom's cooking, and it would appear that one of the country's biggest fast food chains agrees.

Last year, Wendy's unveiled its first new logo since 1983. The burger chain shelved the boxy old Western lettering in favor of a sleeker, modern take on the Wendy's icon coupled with breezy handwritten lettering.

If you look carefully, the word 'mom' can be found in Wendy's collar.

Everything becomes clear: The word 'mom' is really obvious when the new logo is seen in certain situations, such as this paper cup

Do you see it? The new logo was unveiled in March of this year. It has proved to be a popular refresh, but some have claimed the word 'mom' is written beneath Wendy's collar

Old logo: On this logo from 1983 which was used until this year, Wendy is seen to be wearing a collar. The company say the new logo is simply an update on the tried and tested brand

The word becomes really obvious in single-color versions of the logo, which are used on Wendy's Styrofoam cups.

The logo has been steadily rolled out for the last four months and some have noticed a subliminal message in the new logo.

Wendy's say that they didn't realize the hidden message within their logo.

'We are aware of this and find it interesting that it appears our Wendy cameo has 'mom' on her ruffled collar. We can assure you it was unintentional,' said a spokesperson from the company.

One logo-blogging website
believes there is more to the logo than the fast food chain is letting 
on and believe the company are playing off a simple fact that most of us
love the taste of home.

A closer look: When the logo is seen in monochrome, the word 'mom' becomes very apparent

A taste of home: Wendy's says it is not aware of the word 'mom' in its new logo... well, until now that is!

'When growing up our brains learn to love what's on the menu at home. Most of us also associate home cooked meals with a safe and loving environment. Most people have a sentimental attachment to at least a few of the dishes their Mother's used to make,' write Stocklogos.

'It should not be a surprise to see the fast food restaurant, Wendy's associating their refreshed brand with Mom's cooking.

This is something you may not notice consciously for years, but unconsciously it will leave an imprint on your brain and you will associate it with the brand.'

Wendy's say the new logo is being fanned out across its 6,000 North American locations.

Restaurants that have already undergone the makeover have said they're experiencing a 25 percent increase in sales.
