Harvard University's ban on Israeli-made SodaStream machines on campus enacted at the request of pro-Palestinian student groups has now all but fizzled out.

University President Drew Faust and Provost Alan Garber reversed the Ivy League school's decision to cut ties with SodaStream last week after learning that Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS) had banned SodaStream products from campus because the company has a plant in the hotly contested West Bank territory. 

'Harvard University’s procurement decisions should not and will not be driven by individuals’ views of highly contested matters of political controversy,' Garber said in a statement to Boston Magazine.

The ban on SodaStream machines was introduced last spring after Harvard administrators held a meeting with the pro-Palestinian student group Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Harvard Islamic Society.

The decision caused a stir on campus, leading outspoken Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz to write an option piece for The Jerusalem Post arguing that members of the pro-Palestinian faction of the Harvard community could have simply boycotted the SodaStream machines on campus rather than imposing their views on everyone else.

‘I’m sure that some students are offended by any products made in Israel, just as some are offended by products made in Arab or Muslim countries that oppress gays, Christians, and women,’ he wrote. ‘The end result should be freedom of choice: those who disapprove of SodaStream should be free to drink Pepsi. But those who don’t disapprove should be free to drink SodaStream.’

HUDS administrators have since issued an apology for basing their decision solely on the opinion of the pro-Palestinian bloc of the student body.

‘In this instance, we mistakenly factored political concerns raised by students on a particularly sensitive issue into a decision on soda machines,’ a spokesperson for HUDS told the Boston Magazine.

Fizzy vengeance: Pro-Israeli activists have sent the Harvard president and the provost two new SodaStream machines (not pictured) to send them a message  

Pro-Israeli activists on Tuesday struck back at top Harvard officials, shipping the president and the provost two new SodaStream machines as payback for the ban, reported Washington Free Beacon. 

The gifts were accompanied by a note that read: ‘Please enjoy this SodaStream machine, made by Jewish and Arab employees working side-by-side in an Israeli-owned factory,. We hope you will enjoy SodaStream products as much as we do—like millions of people around the world who support coexistence and peace.’

Pro-Israel students on campus expressed disappointment that their views were left out of the debate, and that the college based its decision vis-à-vis SodaStream entirely on the opinions of their ideological rivals.

This was not the first time that HUDS’ purchasing decision has been informed by political concerns.

Last year, dining services officials stopped serving Barilla pasta in response to anti-gay views expressed by the company’s chairman, according to The Harvard Crimson. 

In October, SodaStream announced that it will be closing the factory in the West Bank ‘for commercial reasons’ and moving its operation to a location within Israel.

A pro-Palestinian boycott movement has targeted businesses that operate in the West Bank, saying they benefit from Israel's occupation of the territory, which was captured in 1967 and is claimed by the Palestinians.

Actress Scarlett Johansson got caught up in the controversy over the plant's location earlier this year after she agreed to serve as SodaStream's global brand ambassador.

The decision upset Oxfam International, a humanitarian aid organization for which Johansson had served as a global ambassador for eight years.

The US star severed her ties with the UK charity because of the dispute, citing 'fundamental differences of opinion.'
