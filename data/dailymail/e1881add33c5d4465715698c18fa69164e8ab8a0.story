A magnificent 164 by Ben Stokes led Durham to a Lords final, as they swept to an 83-run win in Saturday's Royal London Cup semi-final against Nottinghamshire at Chester-le-Street.

The total of 353 for eight was 21 more than Durham had managed before in a one-day match, and Stokes broke his own record for the highest individual score - the 150 not out he made in a 40-over league match at Edgbaston in 2011.

Nottinghamshire, who won the Yorkshire Bank 40 final at Lord's last season, quickly slipped to 21 for two in reply and were all out for 270, despite another sparkling century from one-day captain James Taylor.

He followed his unbeaten 146 in the quarter-final win against Derbyshire by making 114 before he was last out in the 47th over.

But Taylor was involved in two calamitous run-outs straight after he and Chris Read had taken 20 off the 39th over, bowled by Chris Rushworth.

The 30-over scores were identical on 158 for three and in the next over Samit Patel reached 50 with a six off Gareth Breese. The ball was caught on the mid-wicket boundary by Calum MacLeod, but his foot had touched the rope.

The stand with Taylor was worth 97, but Patel sat back to cut the next ball and edged to Phil Mustard. That proved crucial as the pressure to match Durham's late onslaught saw Riki Wessels drive Breese to long-on.

Then James Franklin cracked a catch to extra cover before Read and Ajmal Shahzad were run out.

After losing three of their first four games in the competition, Durham will now face Warwickshire on September 20 hoping for a repeat of their one previous appearance in a Lord's final, when they beat Hampshire in the 2007 Friends Provident Trophy.

En route to that final they posted their previous best List A total - 332 for four - at home to Worcestershire.

Fightback: James Taylor led the Notts charge after early wickets with some inventive shot-making

Turning point: Samit Patel, who played well for his 52, is caught behind off the bowling of Breese

Stokes' 113-ball blitz on Saturday included six sixes. Dropped on 12 by Read, standing up to the medium pace of Steven Mullaney, his first 50 came off 47 balls, the second off 37 and the third off 21.

He dominated a fourth-wicket stand of 135 with Mustard, although it was the wicketkeeper who launched the attack which started when they took the five-over batting powerplay after 35 overs.

Mustard had not hit a boundary for 18 overs but suddenly smashed Jake Ball for four, six, four and Durham all but doubled their score in the last 15 overs, which produced 174 runs.

Mustard was run out for 89 in the 40th, but by that stage Nottinghamshire did not know where to bowl at Stokes. Their three seamers - Ball, Luke Fletcher and Shahzad - conceded a total of 240 in 29 overs, while Mullaney was relatively frugal with 47 off 10.

Early-morning rain cleared in time for play to begin promptly at 1030 and, under heavy cloud, Nottinghamshire chose to field.

Hitting out: Taylor continued his superb form with a very good century but it wasn't enough

All round performance: It was fitting that Stokes took the final wicket to win the match with the ball

Mark Stoneman launched Durham's innings with 36 off 29 balls before Fletcher, who had conceded 23 in three overs, switched ends and swung one in to bowl Stoneman off his pads with the score on 61 in the 10th.

Stokes went in at 92 for three in the 15th over and scored 70 of the next 87 runs. There was a touch of finesse about an early leg glance, but he was soon striking the ball with brutal power off the back foot through the off side.

Mullaney and Patel kept things reasonably tight until Stokes drove the left-arm spinner to the extra-cover boundary then launched him over long-on for six.

That was the only maximum in his 84-ball hundred, but five more followed before he fell to the last ball of the 49th over, driving Shahzad to long-on.

In the fourth over of the reply Michael Lumb edged John Hastings to Mustard, then Rushworth nipped one back to bowl Mullaney.

Sam Wood, sent in at three, made 22 off 33 balls before he fell lbw trying to sweep in Breese's first over.

The off-spinner finished with three for 53 and will fulfil his wish to end his 11-year Durham career at Lord's.
