A Spanish cyclist blamed for the death of policemen killed in an ambush as he cycled through Pakistan has released a harrowing video of the attack to prove it was not his fault

It was originally reported that the six men were shot dead while protecting Javier Colorado, 27, who is attempting to cycle around the world, after he crossed into Pakistan's western province of Baluchistan from Iran.

Pakistan claimed that the men were killed when militants opened fire on him on January 22 in the volatile southwestern province of Baluchistan.

But Mr Colarado says they were 
actually killed the previous day when a bomb killed 24 Shiite Muslim 
pilgrims on a bus travelling nearby on the same road.

The
 27-year-old wrote on his Facebook account: 'The deplorable deaths of 
the six officers had nothing to do with the events in which I was a 
victim.'

He also posted a video on YouTube which shows a huge ball of flame erupting far behind the police van.

Apparently frightened and breathless, the Spanish cyclist can be seen crouching for cover by a stone wall near the police van as the sound of gunfire crackles nearby

Soon after, the video shows Colorado lying on the floor of the police vehicle saying: 'They shot at us, they shot at us. I am bleeding'

Apparently hit by shrapnel from a grenade, Colorado said he was treated for a light injury at a nearby clinic and then at a military hospital in Quetta

Apparently frightened and breathless, the Spanish cyclist can be seen 
crouching for cover by a stone wall near the police van as the sound of 
gunfire crackles nearby.

After spending the night in a nearby police station, his journey continues in a van with a driver and armed police guard.

Soon after, the video shows Mr Colorado lying on the floor of the police vehicle saying: 'They shot at us, they shot at us. I am bleeding.'

Apparently
 hit by shrapnel from a grenade, Colorado said he was treated for a 
light injury at a nearby clinic and then at a military hospital in 
Quetta.

Mr Colorado said 
he had to cross Pakistan by road after missing a once-a-month train when
 he arrived late at the border after a journey through Iran.

Pakistani
 police advised him that taking a bus was too dangerous, and instead 
officers took him and his bicycle in police vehicles.

Contrasting stories: Pakistani police reported that Colorado was hurt in the attack, however his family were told he was not injured

According
 to Mr Colorado's Facebook page, he was planning to cycle around the 
world and he previously he posted ‘Adios Iran, Hola Pakistan’ on his 
page.

Mr Colorado's family also posted a message on his Facebook several hours after the attack:

‘This
 is a message from Javier Colorado's family. In the first place we want 
to thank the Spanish consulate in Pakistan for all their help.

'We've 
received a call from the embassy and they have informed us that Javier 
is well and not hurt. Today he will fly to Lahore, on the border with 
India. His initial intent is to continue his trip.’

At the time police said they did not know why Mr Colorado had chosen to cycle through such a dangerous area.

In a statement, the Spanish Foreign Ministry reached out to Pakistan over the death of Colorado's guards.

‘The
 government of Spain wants to transmit to Pakistani authorities its 
profound concern and grief’ over the deaths, said the statement.

Two young Czech women taking the same route by bus were kidnapped in March and are still being held.
