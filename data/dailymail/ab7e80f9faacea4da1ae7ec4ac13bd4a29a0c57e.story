Cate Blanchett, who won an Oscar for her role in Blue Jasmine, pointed out the male domination in her Oscar speech, saying that women were not at the center of most stories in cinema

Despite this year's Oscar successes of films about women, or films starring women in protagonist roles, there are still only as many women in speaking roles as there were in the 1940s.

A recent study from San Diego State University's school of Journalism, Media and Film reveals that speaking roles for women of all ages accounted for around only 33 per cent of characters in the top 100 grossing films last year.

This figure is only slightly higher than the amount of women in major roles back in the 1940s when women played a secondary or minor role in only 78 per cent of the top 100 films of the decade.

The study, conducted by Dr. Martha Lauzen, finds that there has been a 5 per cent increase in women characters in films since 2002, when women represented only 28 per cent of all characters.

However, while the amount of women in movies has increased, those taking a protagonist or starring role has decreased, from 16 per cent to 11 per cent over the last ten years.

Women are also likely to be younger than men when playing protagonists, and are more likely to be identified as married or single.

While recent box office hits like Gravity and Blue Jasmine were both incredibly financially and critically successful, they are only a couple in the face of overwhelmingly male dominated films like The Wolf of Wall Street and Dallas Buyers Club.

Gravity featured Sandra Bullock in a starring role, with her having almost all the screen time. But the film is only one of a few in 2013 to focus on women rather than men

Compared to the 1940s films like Citizen Kane and Casablanca, which focused mainly around men,Â  one would think that the amount of women in films has increased.

But the study suggests the even though more women are directing films today, the portrayal of characters and protagonists are still masculine at the same ratio as the 40s.

Dr. Lauzen, the study's author, says that the problem is not enough women are working in film behind the scenes.

She said: 'Women comprise one-third to more than one-half of students in top film schools around the country.

The study showed that women protagonists were younger more often than not, which could explain the popularity and marketability of stars like Jennifer Lawrence (left). It also showed that women had to have an identifiable profession more than men, such as Sandra Bullock (right) in the film Gravity

Even though there were many women victors at the Oscars, Matthew McConaughey was still an actor that got a lot of credit and will likely go on to get many more speaking roles than his women counterparts

'In genres and venues that are more welcoming of women, their numbers skyrocket.

'Women account for 39% of directors working on documentaries screening at high-profile film festivals around the country, according to the latest Independent Women study, a far cry from the paltry 6% working on top grossing films'

The graph shows the portrayal of different character types in the top grossing movies over the last year. The disparity is massive, and has changed very little from the 1940s

The study also shows the disparity in the different portrayals of characters that could be played by men or women, such as politicians or scientists.

The study found that these sorts of careers are almost always played by men.

Despite Oscar successes for films featuring women in starring roles, many of the films, like The Wolf of Wall Street (pictured) were very male dominated, which had almost no women protagonists and very few in secondary roles

Films like the 1941 film Citizen Kane, which features almost no women, shows how cinema has not statistically changed in the amount of women in speaking roles since the 1940s

Out of politician characters, 93 per cent were played by men, with only 7 per cent played by women, and men played 70 per cent of scientific or intellectual leaders while women only played 30 per cent.

The disparity also extends to race, with the study finding that the percentage of African-American female protagonists fell hugely in ten years, from 15 per cent to 8 per cent.
