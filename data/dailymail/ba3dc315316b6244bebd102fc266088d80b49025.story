The family of a British teacher who was raped and murdered while living in Japan faced fresh torment yesterday as a film about her killer’s escape from justice went on general release there.

In 2011, Tatsuya Ichihashi was jailed for life for the brutal murder of 22-year-old Lindsay Hawker, right, after spending almost three years on the run.

The film I Am Ichihashi: Journal Of A Murderer is based on a book by Ichihashi.

Lindsay's killer Tatsuya Ichihashi, 34, spent three years on the run and mutilated his face to avoid detection. Here he is pictured before his time on the run, left, and after he was caught, right. He kept a detailed journal

A friend of the Hawker family said: ‘How would anyone feel about the killer of their daughter turning their suffering into entertainment?’

The film recounts how Ichihashi, 34, fled after police discovered Lindsay’s body buried in sand in a bath on the balcony of his Tokyo flat in 2007. While on the run he underwent plastic surgery.

Ichihashi is appealing against his life sentence, insisting that he did not mean to kill Lindsay.

Ichihashi approached Lindsay, pictured, at a station and asked for English lessons, before raping and murdered her at his flat. Her parents previously described his choice to write a book as 'strange and disrespectful'
