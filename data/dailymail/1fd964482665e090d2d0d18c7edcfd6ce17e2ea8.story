In his autobiography published late last year, Andrew Cuomo described himself as the victim in his bitter divorce from Kerry Kennedy - saying he learned about the break-up from a reporter who called him for comment. 

But a new biography of the New York governor says he had a larger part in the unraveling of the marriage, which briefly united two political dynasties. 

Vanity Fair's Michael Shnayerson alleges in 'The Contender' that the couple started talking 'not if but when' to divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter Michaela in 1997.

However, Cuomo dragged out the break-up for years - possibly to use his wife's political clout to fuel his failed 2002 gubernatorial run, the book alleges.

Doomed: A new biography of  Andrew Cuomo details the bitter divorce between the current New York Governor and Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F Kennedy. The former couple pictured above on their wedding day in 1990

The New York Daily News, which previewed the book, cited Shnayerson's sources who said the couple learned they were incompatible fairly early on in their relationship. 

Shnayerson did not interview Cuomo himself.

Shnayerson quotes a Douglas Kennedy - Kerry's 46-year-old younger brother -  who says that while Cuomo treasured the connection to the Kennedy family, he loathed participating in reunions at the family's estate in Hyannis, Massachusetts and eventually stopped going altogether.

Douglas Kennedy said on one occasion, when the Kennedys spent a night partying and singing, Cuomo stood by 'looking disgusted'. Douglas also described Cuomo as a 'bully' who thought many member's of his wife's family as weak or 'political'. 

Not if, but when: Author Michael Shnayerson says in 'The Contender' that Cuomo and Kennedy started talking not if 'but when' to divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter Michaela in 1997.

Staying together for the campaign: Kennedy allegedly decided to stay with her husband during his ultimately failed 2002 run for governor. According to the book, the couple agreed to break-up after the campaign, but Cuomo kept putting it off

Perhaps one of the most painful digs at the Kennedy family was the Manhattan party that acted as the informal launch for Cuomo's 2002 campaign for governor. 

At the party, the Rolling Stones song 'Sympathy for the Devil' was played at high-volume - a song which deals with the assassinations of both President John F Kennedy and Kerry father's Robert F Kennedy. 

The Kennedy's who were in the room for the party were aghast, but it's unclear if Cuomo was behind the decision to play the song.

Disdain for the in-laws wasn't the only issue between the political couple. Kerry Kennedy and Cuomo harbored ill-feelings about the little things too, the book claims.

When she first started dating Cuomo, Kennedy allegedly 'rolled her eyes a bit' when she saw the plastic covers he kept on his furniture. 

And a friend close to one side of the former couple told Shnayerson that Cuomo wasn't dazzled by his wife's cooking, cleaning or even the 'dowdy' way she dressed. 

By the time Cuomo started planning his 2002 run for governor, his wife agreed to stay with him through the campaign. 

But when the campaign failed, Cuomo allegedly asked her to stay together for just a little longer. 

The breaking point for Kennedy, according to Shnayerson, came when Cuomo confronted her for having an extra-marital affair with polo player Bruce Colley.

A 'closer observer' told Shnayerson that Kennedy told Cuomo to mind his own business, break the news to the kids and move out of their home. 

'After 13 years of marriage, and truly stressful times, I knew the ties that bound us together had frayed,' Cuomo wrote in his autobiography All Things Possible, published late last year. 'But I had hoped we could work through what I saw was a difficult time, not an end. Obviously, I was in denial.'

'Even though Kerry had told me she wanted a divorce I thought I could fix it, I couldn’t accept it — it only became real when a reporter called and said she filed the papers.' 

Breaking point: The couple officially divorced in 2005. Cuomo eventually won the New York governorship in 2011 - the same year he started dating celebrity cook Sandra Lee. Above, Cuomo and family after his re-election last November. From left to right: Cara, Michaela, Cuomo, Sandra Lee, and Mariah

The couple originally said their break-up was amicable, but that didn't last long, according to the book. Soon an attorney for the Cuomos started spreading stories about Kennedy's betrayal.

Cuomo did eventually win the New York governorship in 2011 - the same year he started dating celebrity cook Sandra Lee. 

Kerry Kennedy still lives near her ex-husband in Westchester, New York. 

Last week on Wednesday, their youngest daughter Michaela was rushed to the hospital when she was found unconscious at her mother's home. 

The 17-year-old was treated and released from Westchester Medical Center. It's still unclear what caused the medical emergency. 

Michael Shnayerson's 'The Contender' is due out on March 31.
