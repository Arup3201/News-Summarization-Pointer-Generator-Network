Manchester United have joined the running to sign Burnley striker Danny Ings.

Louis van Gaal sent chief scout Jim Lawlor to watch Ings play against Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday night after the 22-year-old scored at Old Trafford in February.

Liverpool were favourites to sign the England Under-21 forward in January with his contract ending this summer, but Brendan Rodgers has competition to bring him to Anfield.

Born: England, July 23 1992 (age 22)

2006-2009: Bournemouth (youth)

2009-2011: Bournemouth (27 apps, 7 gls)

2010-2010: Dorchester Town (loan) (9, 4)

2011-NOW: Burnley (112, 36) 

2013-NOW: England U21 (7, 4) 

Ings has been tracked by Real Sociedad and the former Bournemouth youth travelled to Spain to meet manager David Moyes three weeks ago.

But Burnley would receive about £6million in compensation if Ings joined another club in England, while a move abroad would net the second-bottom  side just £300,000.

It would cost £43m for United to make Radamel Falcao's season-long loan from Monaco permanent, and Ings is a cut-price option.

The starlet was reluctant to leave Burnley in January but becomes a free agent after May.

Manchester City contacted his representatives in February and want to sign Ings to boost their homegrown quota. 

The  champions bought Wilfried Bony from Swansea City for £25m, rising to £28m, in January but Juventus have shown interest in Stevan Jovetic, while Edin Dzeko could leave for Wolfsburg.

The loss of Frank Lampard to New York City and possibly James Milner would leave Manuel Pellegrini short of home talent, and Ings could fill the gap.

The £5million compensation would be far cheaper than the £43m they would have to pay for Radamel Falcao

Falcao has not impressed enough at United since joining from Monaco on a season-long loan
