Excluded: Sian Lloyd, with Jonathan Ashman on their 2007 wedding day

Sian Lloyd was said to be devastated last night after being ‘uninvited’ from the wedding of her stepdaughter Suzanne Ashman to Euan Blair, son of the former prime minister.

TV weathergirl Miss Lloyd married Suzanne’s father, 64-year-old motor racing entrepreneur Jonathan Ashman, after a whirlwind romance six years ago and had been preparing to attend tomorrow’s ceremony for weeks.

But just days ago she was told that she would not be welcome at the Blair family mansion in Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire, where the wedding party is due to take place.

‘She was basically and unceremoniously uninvited,’ explained a close friend last night. 

‘Sian is devastated and at one stage Jonathan was talking about not going if Sian was not allowed to attend.

'But Sian has insisted he attend as he is giving his only child away and simply must be there.

‘The mystery remains for Sian as to why she has been excluded. She has been met with a wall of silence from both Suzanne and the Blair side so she just has to accept what she has been told.’ 

It is not known if Miss Ashman herself decided that Miss Lloyd, 55, should not attend the wedding – or if she has been excluded for anything she might have said publicly or privately about the Blair family in the past.

‘All she knows,’ added a friend, ‘is that she has got an embossed wedding invitation with her name on it and now she will not be going –  and she is none the wiser why.’ 

Mr Ashman’s 25-year-old daughter Suzanne is from his marriage to first wife Sedef, which ended more than 13 years ago. 

She is the daughter of a former Turkish government minister and one-time mayor of Ankara.

Euan Blair, 29, who has been dating Suzanne for eight years, is due to marry her at South Pavilion, the Buckinghamshire mansion that his parents bought for £4million in 2008.

The young couple were introduced by former defence secretary Geoff Hoon.

In recent weeks it has been suggested the Blairs – who are estimated to be worth more than £60 million – are planning a stunning wedding and reception for the couple who became engaged last Christmas and have bought a house together in Islington, North London.

Miss Ashman read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Trinity College, Oxford, after leaving the private St Paul’s Girls’ School in south-west London.

She carried out work experience with Mr Hoon during which she met Euan Blair. She later worked at Tony Blair’s Faith Foundation.

Last year, after working for American merchant bank Morgan Stanley, Euan became a business development manager at the Coventry-based Sarina Russo Job Access – part of the Government’s Work Programme – in a move said by some to be a stepping stone towards following his father into politics.

Euan is the eldest of the Blairs’ four children and he is the first to marry, though it is unclear whether it will be a Roman Catholic service.

He was brought up a Catholic and attended the popular Catholic Oratory school in West London before going to Bristol University where he obtained a 2:1 in History.

Cherie Blair is a Catholic and her husband joined the Catholic Church in 2007.

Guests who are expected at the wedding include Cherie Blair’s Muslim convert sister Lauren but her father, actor Tony Booth, may not be well enough to attend.

Miss Lloyd met Jonathan Ashman at a St David’s Day party at Westminster Palace hosted by then Secretary of State for Wales Peter Hain in 2007.

Mr Ashman proposed to her in December that year at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania while they were on holiday and the pair married just weeks later at the Portmeirion Hotel in Gwynedd, Wales.

Last night Miss Lloyd was unavailable for comment. A spokesman for Tony Blair did not wish to comment.
