She was said to be ‘terrified’ about stepping in for Claudia Winkleman on Strictly Come Dancing at the weekend.

But Zoe Ball needn’t have worried – fans of the show think she did such a good job that they are calling for her to become a permanent member of the team.

As 9.8million tuned in to watch the Halloween special on Saturday night, hundreds logged on to Twitter to say Miss Ball, 43, was outshining star presenter Tess Daly, 45.

Some called for the former Radio One DJ to be paired with or replace Miss Winkleman, 42, who had to stay at home to care for one of her children who was poorly.

One viewer wrote: ‘Oooh just switched Strictly on. I love Zoe Ball! She always dresses so well, I love her hair. Get rid of Tess and let Zoe & Claudia present!’

Another posted: ‘They’ve got rid of Brucey ... how long til they scrap Tess so we can finally get the Zoe Ball & Claudia Winkleman dream team.’

A third pleaded with the BBC: ‘BBC Strictly Zoe Ball is SOOOO much better on Strictly than Claudia. Please keep her on the main shows.’

Currently Miss Ball presents Strictly’s spin off show It Takes Two, which sees her interview contestants every week night on BBC2.

Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills, who last night became the latest contestant to leave, claimed Miss Ball wasn’t eyeing a move to the main show following her success.

Viewers tweeted their support for Miss Ball, with some calling on the BBC to give her a permanent slot on the show instead of either Miss Daly (left) or Miss Winkleman (right)

He said: ‘I saw her before backstage and she was absolutely terrified. Obviously she’s done live television for quite a few years but there’s something about doing the main show that is a lot of pressure.

‘She nailed it, she always does. But I understand that last night was a big gig for her. I think she’s very happy doing what she does on It Takes Two.’

Miss Winkleman joined the Strictly presenting team at the start of the series after Sir Bruce Forsyth bowed out of the show.

She has three children with her husband Kris Thykier – Jake, 11, Matilda, eight, and Arthur, three.
