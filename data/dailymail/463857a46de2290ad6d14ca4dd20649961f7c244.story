David Cameron today convened an urgent meeting to prepare for the possibility that Greece could crash out of the eurozone.

The Prime Minister chaired an hour-long meeting of officials from the Treasury, Foreign Office and the Bank of England about the threat to the UK economy.

New Greek PM Alexis Tsipras last night used his inaugural speech in parliament to insist his demand for restructuring the country's debt is 'irrevocable.'

Senior officials from across Whitehall were called to the Cabinet room in Number 10 this morning amid concerns about the risk of 'contagion' to Britain.

It included Treasury permanent secretary Sir Nicholas Macpherson, and officials from the Department for Business, Foreign Office and the financial regulatory arm of the Bank of England. 

Most of Greece's national debt is held by eurozone institutions and not by Britain, which could limit the impact if it defaults.

But Mr Cameron's official spokesman warned: 'There do remain risks around contagion and uncertainty and so it is important to look at all of those.'

Today's meeting mirrors contingency planning carried out in 2012, at the height of the last threat to the Greek economy.

Foreign Office officials briefed Mr Cameron on the political situation while the Bank of England and Treasury gave details of the risk of economic instability spreading across the continent.

It was agreed that contingency planning should continue to be stepped up, said Downing Street.

Mr Cameron's spokesman stressed that there are some 'obvious differences' with the 2012 crisis, including the fact that bond yields on the debts of countries such as Portugal, Ireland and Spain are not so high.

The spokesman said: 'We have the clear positions from the new Greek government about staying in the eurozone and the comments from eurozone countries around maintaining that eurozone unity. We need to underline the determination of the eurozone countries and Greek government have signalled with regard to the euro.

'But we need to look at the risks of pressures in financial markets as potential uncertainty grows, as clearly there are difficult discussions going on between the Greek government and the eurozone countries and in that context, we need to look across the full range of issues.'

Asked whether the City of London was exposed to uncertainty in Greece, the Prime Minister's spokesman said: 'Greek bonds are overwhelmingly held in the eurozone because the ECB has been providing capital and liquidity into Greek financial institutions.

'Clearly there are global economic interdependencies and London is a major global financial centre, so it is something we need to be vigilant about.' 

George Osborne warned that a eurozone stand-off over Greek debt is becoming the biggest risk to the global economy after meeting Greece's new finance minister Yanis Varoufakis in London last week

Athens has until the end of this month to secure around £5billion of financing to keep the Greek economy running.

Failure to do so could cause the country to default on its debts and pull out of the single currency.

Both Greece and other eurozone countries have stressed that they do not want to see exit from the single currency.

But the country's ruling far-Left Syriza party has vowed to ditch austerity, setting the nation on a collision course with the rest of the single currency bloc.

Mr Tsipras has pledged to write off some of the country's debts and renegotiate the terms of its £185billion bailout package — a deal that Germany has already said is 'too generous'.

Chancellor George Osborne said yesterday: 'This stand-off between Greece and the Eurozone is increasing the risks every day to the British economy.

'A Greek exit would cause real ructions. We must have an international effort to resolve the stand-off.'

Mr Cameron is due to meet Mr Tsipras for the first time on Thursday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels. 

Hours after Syriza's election triumph last month, Mr Cameron warned it would 'increase economic uncertainty across Europe'.
