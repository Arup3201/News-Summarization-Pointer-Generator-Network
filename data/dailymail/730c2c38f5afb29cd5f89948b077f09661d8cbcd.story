Victim: Azelle Rodney, 24, was killed during a police 'hard stop' in north London in April 2005

A policeman shouted ‘sweet as’ moments after his colleague gunned down a suspect, an inquiry heard yesterday.

Azelle Rodney, 24, died instantly when he was shot six times in a busy high street.

The rounds were fired from the open window of a patrol car within a split second of it pulling alongside the VW Golf carrying Rodney.

The firearms officer – known only as E7 – was sitting in the front seat and let off eight shots after police in another car had forced the Golf to slow down.

They believed that Rodney and the two men with him had machine guns and were on their way to rob Colombian drug dealers.

In a dramatic recording of the incident, played yesterday to a long awaited inquiry into the case, a police officer in a car tailing the suspects says: ‘We’re going in.’

Moments later, the firearms officer starts shooting and then the policeman in another car appears to say: ‘Sweet as, sweet as’. No words of warning from the armed officers can be heard on the video.

Details of the killing emerged on the first day of an inquiry into the death in Edgware, North London, on April 30, 2005. It is the first time this type of hearing has been held to examine the evidence of a fatal shooting by police officers.

Held instead of an inquest, it is taking place in the High Court in London in front of Sir Christopher Holland.

A coroner ruled in 2007 that his court could not see relevant intelligence material, thought to come from phone taps.

Officials hope the public hearing will dampen any accusations of a police and political cover-up. Rodney’s family may find they are left with unanswered questions however because the method by which intelligence was gathered will not be revealed during the hearing.

Yesterday Ashley Underwood, QC, counsel for the inquiry, played a video recording, captured by another officer, of  the ‘hard stop’ performed by a convoy of unmarked police cars driving through suburban streets just after 7.30pm.

As they follow the Golf, one officer says: ‘We’re looking to do it at the roundabout, if he stops.’

Moments
 after the car stops, shots can be heard. However, pictures of the 
shooting were not captured on the video. Mr Underwood said Rodney was 
killed ‘more or less instantly’.

When ballistics experts examined the car they found a Colt .45 calibre pistol on the driver’s side of the back seat, partly covered in plastic.

It was incapable of firing and was 
not loaded, although three rounds of suitable ammunition were found in a
 plastic bag on the floor of the car.

Two
 other guns were found in a rucksack in the back footwell – a Baikal 
pistol wrapped in a scarf that was loaded but its safety catch was on, 
and another which was wrapped in a glove.

It was loaded and the safety catch was off. Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham, the other occupants of the VW Golf, were arrested and later admitted possession of firearms.

Explaining the background of the case, Mr Underwood said that in early April 2005 Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise, as it was known then, received intelligence about an armed gang that robbed drug dealers.

Its modus operandi would be to set up a meeting to view Class A drugs and then steal them at gunpoint.

HMCE believed that one of the men in the gang was called ‘Azelle’ and had the same day and month of birth as Rodney.

Speaking
 before the hearing, Rodney’s mother, Susan Alexander said: ‘My main 
concern is to see a robust, effective and transparent inquiry. Everyone 
needs to know what happened why my son died that day.’

The inquiry, which is expected to last ten weeks, continues..
