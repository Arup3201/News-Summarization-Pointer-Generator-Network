A grieving mother has defended her heartbreaking decision to spend thousands of pounds on presents for her baby, despite the fact he died before birth.

Sabrina McKenna, 34, says shopping for gifts for her son helps her cope  with her loss and pay tribute to  Jamie, who died aged 32 weeks in June, 2012.

But her decision to post images of what would have been her son's nursery crammed with gifts and toys has led to her being abused online. 

Sabrina McKenna, 34, says shopping for gifts for her baby son Jamie helps her cope with her loss

Sabrina has now decided to speak out about her experience to make people understand why she enjoys buying toys for her son.

She said: 'Buying presents for Jamie helps me cope with my loss, so who has the right to judge or attack me for that?

'I'm sick of people's cruel comments about me. I've been through enough already without receiving vile messages from strangers.'

She continued: 'Buying toys for him is my way of feeling close to him.

'There are so many things that he never got to do and I never got to do for him, so this small act helps me - we all cope in different ways.

'If it offends people, they shouldn't look. If placing toys in his room gives me the strength to carry on, who has got the right to tell me to stop?'

Sabrina cradles her baby son Jamie, who died in the womb eight weeks before her due date

Miss McKenna was 31 when she finally conceived with her partner after convincing herself she might never be able to fall pregnant.

She explained: 'I'd had a long term relationship in the past and we had tried unsuccessfully for many years with no joy.'

So she was ecstatic when her dream came true and at 20 weeks, she learned she was carrying a son.

She said: 'I had always loved the name Jamie and told anyone who would listen that I couldn't wait to spoil him rotten after waiting for so long to have him.'

The only time Sabrina McKenna felt any peace was in Jamie's nursery, surrounded by all his things

Miss McKenna, a former office worker from Omagh, Co. Tyrone, decorated the nursery and awaited her son's arrival.

But at 32 weeks a routine scan failed to pick up a heartbeat. 

She said: 'He was due in eight weeks. I kept saying there must be a mistake and praying they were wrong. I just could not believe what was happening.'

But consultants confirmed Jamie had died and Miss McKenna was to be induced.

After a 12-hour labour, her baby was born and Miss McKenna recalled desperately hoping to hear a cry. 

Back home she planned her son's funeral and the night before it took place, she brought him home.

She said: 'It gave me a tiny comfort to have him home, just for one night. It meant that he was in the nursery I had prepared for him.'

The stress of Jamie's death led to Sabrina's split with her partner, making her  spend more time in the nursery

Buying toys for Jamie is Sabrina's way of saying, 'you are gone but I am still thinking of you,' she said

Over the coming months she was engulfed by depression and despair as she struggled to come to terms with her loss. 

She said: 'The only time I felt any peace at all was sitting in his nursery among all his things - the clothes and toys I had bought for him when he was alive.'

A postmortem found that her placenta had stopped working and Jamie had not been growing, but did not confirm why.

The stress of the death lead her to split with her partner and Miss McKenna says she started to spend even more time in her son's nursery.

Then one day, she decided to buy a few more toys. 

She said: 'I had been so happy when I was getting ready for Jamie's arrival so I thought why not keep buying for him? He is still my son.

Sabrina says her methods of coping with the death of her  baby son help give her the strength to carry on

Sabrina survived her first Christmas after Jamie's stillbirth by buying a present and taking it to his grave

'I went shopping and picked up a few bits and for those few hours I felt some peace and then joy when I took them home and placed them on his shelf.

'It was just my way of saying to him 'you are gone but I am still thinking of you.'

Six months later, the first Christmas she had been dreading arrived and Miss McKenna said spending £200 on a remote control toy and cuddly characters eased her pain.

She said: 'I took them to his grave to show him. It got me through the day, so I was grateful.' 

She now runs half marathons to raise money for neonatal death charity SANDS

Sabrina's family and close friends supported her decision but others failed to understand.

A year after the birth, she decided to arrange a 'birthday party' to mark Jamie's anniversary.

She booked a bouncy castle and invited family and friends who also brought presents for Jamie.

Miss McKenna said: 'I was so moved that people understood and it turned what could have been the most horrific day into a happy one. How can anyone say this is wrong?'

But several people started to make nasty comments after Miss McKenna began posting images of her son's toys online.

She reveals that she has been labelled a freak and a weirdo and told to 'forget and move on'.

She said: 'It's heartbreaking because people don't have to look. 

'Why shouldn't I do something that makes that pain just a little easier.'

The former factory worker, who runs half marathons to raise money for neonatal death charity Sands, has not been able to work since losing her son and pays for his gifts using money saved from her benefits.

This year, she spent £300 on toys and a bike for Christmas – her third without him.

She said: 'I will never get the chance to do all the things I wanted to do for Jamie. This is the only way I can express my love. 

'I hope that one day I will feel strong enough to donate all of his wonderful toys to charity.

'I love the idea of other children getting pleasure from the things I have bought for Jamie. But until then they will stay in his room. 

'I wish he was there too but nothing can change that.

'All I can do is continue in the way I have found that makes life easier and if you don't want to try and least to understand then please just look the other way instead of posting nasty messages. 

'I just hope the people that are ridiculing me never have to understand what it feels like to lose a much wanted baby.' 

According to the neonatal death charity Sands, each year in the UK over 6,500 babies die just before, during or soon after birth. That’s 17 babies every day.

Stillbirth rates in the UK haven't changed since the late 1990s, with one in every 200 births ending in stillbirth. 

One in every 300 babies dies within the first four weeks of life.

More than 90 per cent of babies who are stillborn have no congenital abnormality.

Around a third of stillbirths are unexplained and occur with perfectly formed, normal-sized babies.

One in three stillbirths happen at near term when babies could survive if they were delivered.
