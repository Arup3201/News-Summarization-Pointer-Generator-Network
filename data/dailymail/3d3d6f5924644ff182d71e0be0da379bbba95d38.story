Dozens of exam qualifications in subjects such as film studies and home economics are to be axed.

Regulator Ofqual plans to cull 14 GCSEs and 29 AS and A levels, while reforming other qualifications.

Media studies, for example, is to be reformed in GCSEs, AS and A levels. Under the proposals, film studies will be revamped at GCSE and AS-level but scrapped at A-level.

The GCSEs planned to be discontinued include expressive arts, electronics, catering, home economics, manufacturing, engineering, performing arts and humanities.

The aim is to make qualifications in different subjects ‘similar in their level of demand and assessment structure’ and to cut out ‘similar or overlapping’ courses.

Tougher GCSEs in English and maths are being introduced from September 2015, and in history, geography, the sciences and languages the following year.

In 2016, reformed GCSEs will also be launched in subjects including art and design, music, drama and dance, computer science, PE and religious studies.

Ofqual has published a consultation paper on new standards for all other subjects in the secondary curriculum.

It plans to ‘regulate in ways that are likely to affect the range of subjects available’ in future and could lead to exam boards ‘choosing not to continue with some existing subjects’.

Its report says: ‘We plan to set out clear principles that we will use to determine, before core content is developed, if a subject is likely to lead to the development of the GCSE, AS and A-level qualifications we expect.

‘If a subject does not meet these principles we will not allow it to be developed as a GCSE, AS or A-level subject.’

Home economics – a qualification awarded to 32,064 students in 2012 – and catering – awarded to 20,891 teenagers – are deemed too similar to the new design and technology GCSE in food technology.

Performing arts at GCSE, which was awarded to 4,365 students in 2012, is seen as overlapping with new exams in dance and drama.

At AS and A-level, courses set to be cut include environmental studies, which overlaps with new science courses, along with human biology, which is listed as similar to biology.

A separate list shows 20 GCSE subjects that are being considered for reform including business studies, economics, geology, hospitality and law.

There are also 27 AS-level subjects to be considered for reform, along with 26 A-levels. These include media studies, law, history of art, critical thinking and philosophy.

Exam boards will be expected to draw up ‘core content’ for each, with input from teachers, employers and higher education. The reformed qualifications will need approval by Ofqual.

Revamped qualifications will be first taught from 2017. The majority of unreformed AS and A-levels will go from 2016 and GCSEs from the following year.

Ofqual’s chief regulator, Glenys Stacey, said: ‘We will expect exam boards to consider factors such as demand and merit before making a case to us that any subject they choose to develop can meet the standards we set.’

Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said last night: ‘There are a few areas where we do have concerns about proposals to discontinue popular qualifications, in particular film studies at A-level and home economics at GCSE. We will be picking this up with Ofqual.’
