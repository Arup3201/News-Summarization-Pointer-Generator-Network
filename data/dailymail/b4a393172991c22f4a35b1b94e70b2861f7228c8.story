The number of people out of work for more than a year has hit the highest level for 17 years, new figures showed today.

But long-term unemployment hit 915,000 in June, marking a return to levels last seen in 1996.

The revelation overshadowed figures showing that the total jobless number fell by 57,000 in the quarter to May to 2.51 million, the lowest since last autumn.

Long-term unemployment hit 915,000 in June, marking a return to levels last seen 17 years ago despite falls in the overall number of people without a job

Unions warned of the ‘misery’ faced by those without work for over 12 months.

Most of the economic figures from the Office for National Statistics were positive, with more people finding jobs and more vacancies.

The number of people claiming Jobseekers Allowance also fell to 1.478million, the lowest level since March 2011 and lower than at the election in May 2010.

But just over 460,000 people have been jobless for more than two years, the highest figure since 1997.

The number of people classed as economically inactive also increased in the latest quarter, up by 87,000 to 9.04 million.

The figure included a 44,000 increase in economically inactive students, a 26,000 rise among the long-term sick and 8,000 more people who retired early.

Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, said: ‘Small relief in the unemployment figures will be no comfort to those struggling with the misery of long-term unemployment.

‘Every job lost is a personal tragedy and the Government has to do more to tackle the persistent jobs crisis.’

Positive: The total number of people claiming Jobseekers Allowance fell to 1.478million, the lowest level since March 2011 and lower than at the election in May 2010.

Wage rises are failing to keep pace with increasing living costs, making it harder for workers to make ends meet

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady added: ‘While today's figures show some welcome small improvements our labour market remains a long way off from a strong recovery.

‘Long-term unemployment is at a 17-year high and youth unemployment remains at crisis levels.

‘Those in work are continuing to see the value of their wages pushed down by inflation, as the biggest squeeze in living standards for over a century continues.’

Prime Minister David Cameron said the latest employment figures were 'encouraging'

The Office for National Statistics also reported that 29.7 million people were in employment in the three months to May, up 16,000 on the previous quarter, and an increase of 336,000 on a year ago.

Unemployment is 72,000 lower than a year ago, with a jobless rate of 7.8 per cent.

Youth unemployment fell by 20,000 to 959,000, giving a jobless rate for 16 to 24-year-olds of 20.9 per cent.

Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons today, David Cameron said: 'The unemployment figures today are welcome.

'They see a very large fall in the claimant count today - 20,000 in the last month and encouraging signs in terms of employment growth.

'Some of that is because of the extra resources that we put in to apprenticeships - over one million people starting apprenticeships in this Parliament which we can be proud of.

'I hope that the fall in unemployment will be welcomed across the House.'

Average earnings increased by 1.7 per cent in the year to May, up by 0.2 per cent on the previous month, giving an average weekly wage of £476.

However the squeeze on incomes continues, after inflation figures this week showed the cost of living was up 2.9 per cent last month.

Employment Minister Mark Hoban said: ‘Our welfare reform agenda is about making a fair and affordable system that incentivises work: giving people the support they need to get off benefits and into a job.

‘Today's figures are encouraging, with the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance down and the number of people in work increasing.

‘The fall in the number of people claiming out-of-work benefits, together with the news that there are currently over half a million vacancies available in the UK economy, show that there are opportunities out there for those who are prepared to work hard, and who aspire to get on in life.’
