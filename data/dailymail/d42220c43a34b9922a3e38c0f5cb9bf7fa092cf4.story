Audiences of BBC children's show Blue Peter are being forced to go through security scanners over fears members of the public may bring dangerous objects and weapons into the studio.

The new security measures at the CBBC studios have been implemented since the Jeremy Kyle Show began filming at the same location last month.

Now panel members and audiences have to enter the studios through 'airport-style x-ray machines' as a result of the controversial ITV chat show moving to Blue Tower Studios in Salford’s Media City.

Weapons scare: Audiences off children's show Blue Peter, presented by Barney Harwood and Helen Skelton, now have to be checked for weapons since the Jeremy Kyle Show moved in to their studios

Previously, the Manchester studios were home to Blue Peter and other CBBC programmes, but since Jeremy Kyle's move from ITV's Granada, new safety measures have been put in place.

'It's like the studio has gone on lockdown, with everything needing to be bolted to the floor so it’s not stole,' a source told The Sun.

'It all seems a little ridiculous, but I guess they’ve got to be careful with the guests on Jeremy Kyle.

'The famous Blue Peter Garden is just outside – so you can imagine the atmosphere is now very different.'

Controversy: The new security measures have been described as 'requirements' for the Jeremy Kyle Show

ITV told the paper the new security measures are 'required' for the controversial television show, which is not foreign to guests getting physical on set.

The Jeremy Kyle show, previously 
branded 'a form of human bear baiting,' by a Manchester judge, has seen several convictions of assault following violence on set.

Earlier this month Jason McPartland, 41, told a
court he was 'goaded' by production staff into punching a relative's 
ex-boyfriend in front of a baying audience.

The show, which was never broadcast, on the theme ‘You can’t stop me seeing our children just because you
hate my new girlfriend!’ was filmed last summer.

After the hearing, an ITV spokesman said: ‘The Jeremy Kyle Show does not show violence and  neither does it condone it.’

Previous court cases involving the 
show include and assault case in 2007, where David Staniforth, 45, 
headbutted Larry Mahoney, a lodger who had an affair with his wife, at 
the studios.

In 2009, Judge Sean Enright said the 
programme exploited ‘foolish and gullible’ people as he jailed Jamie 
Juste, 26, for attacking his girlfriend Rebecca Langley after an episode
on her alleged infidelity was shown

After the assault case in 2007, Jeremy Kyle defended the show’s set-up stating: 'Some people will always think I've got the eyes of Satan. Others will think I'm a TV god.

'Sometimes people need to be stripped bare before they can be helped.'
