Chile's World Cup preparations nearly took an unexpected turn for the worse when the team's bus driver almost ran over a female fan.

Travelling at full speed along a highway the coach is seen having to slam on the brakes to avoid knocking a down a woman who ran in front of the vehicle to greet the players.

Maniac: The female fan ran onto the highway in an attempt to greet the Chile national football team on board

As a squadron of police escorts pass the crowd, who wait to catch a glimpse of Chile's stars such as Arturo Vidal and Alexis Sanchez, a woman in a pink top and jeans is spotted walking along a concrete barrier in the middle of the road before stepping out onto it.

Unafraid of risking her life, the fan approaches the bus and starts dancing with the speeding vehicle narrowly avoiding a fatal accident by mere centimetres.

Chile open their World Cup campaign on Friday against Australia in Group B at Cuiaba's Arena Pantanal.

Star: Chile are hopeful that talisman Arturo Vidal (centre) will be fit for their World Cup opener vs Australia

The South American's are hoping that talisman midfielder Vidal will be fit for the clash against the Socceroos after stuggling with inflammation in his right knee following an operation on his meniscus last month.

The 27-year-old has trained with the team since Wednesday and featured for 15 minutes in a 2-0 friendly win over Northern Ireland last week.
