This is the terrifying moment sledgehammer-wielding thugs smashed into a busy jewellery shop in broad daylight.

Four masked thugs in hoodies and balaclavas jumped out of a black Audi outside the store before storming it with a hammer in front of terrified customers.

The store was packed with customers, including families and a man in a wheelchair, at the time of the afternoon attack.

Attack: CCTV footage shows thugs attacking Almas Jewellers in broad daylight

Violent: The criminals pulled up outside the shop in Rusholme, Manchester, in a black Audi

Thugs: The thieves wore hoodies and balaclavas to cover their faces during the attack of Almas Jewellers

Theft: After wedging open the shop's security shutters, the criminals took handfuls of jewellery from the window

Two of the raiders acted as lookouts, while another man repeatedly smashed into the strengthened glass with a hammer.

It triggered a security system which automatically closed the shutters and filled the shop with clouds of smoke.

But the thugs jammed the shutters open and grabbed several bracelets and necklaces from the display, stuffing them into a green bag.

Brave local traders and passers-by hurled stones, drinking glasses and even a chair at the getaway car, but the raiders fled.

Terrified: The shop was full of families who witnessed the daylight raid

Getaway: Despite store owners and passers-by throwing missiles at the car, the thieves were able to speed off with their haul

Shakeel Almas, 52, who owns the Almas Jewellers shop in Rusholme, Manchester, said: 'People were screaming and shouting, they were terrified.Â 

'This is a high-risk area for robberies, and the businessmen are scared here. This is our investment and livelihood.'

Police have launched an investigation into the brazen, daylight raid.

Det Insp Theresa Carter based at Longsight Police Station said: 'Fortunately, no one was hurt but the fact that staff witnessed these men smash the front window with sledgehammers while they were inside has affected them greatly.

'No one expects to go to work and be put through this type of ordeal when they get there.'
