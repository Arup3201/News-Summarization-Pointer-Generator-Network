Nedum Onuoha is wanted by Hull City. The QPR centre-back is one of several players poised to leave should the Loftus Road club go down as they consider streamlining their squad. 

The 28-year-old has 15 months left on contract and has played regularly under Chris Ramsey. 

Onuoha was in the starting eleven for the Saturday's crucial 4-1 win over relegation rivals West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns. 

Nedum Onuoha is being targeted by Hull City but is also interesting Everton and West Ham United

Stoke manager Mark Hughes who signed him for QPR is also interested as are Everton and West Ham. 

QPR have held talks over a move for Catania defender Nicolas Spolli. The 32-year-old has been on loan at Roma.

Hull, meanwhile, are also showing interest in West Bromwich Albion striker Victor Anichebe who is likely to be sold this summer.
