Three top retailers have been criticised by mental health charities for selling fancy dress costumes that appeared to trivialise mental health issues.

Supermarket giant Asda has announced it will make a £25,000 donation to the mental health charity Mind after it apologised for advertising an outfit comprised of a ragged, blood-spattered straitjacket - and pictured worn by someone covered in blood and brandishing a machete - as a 'mental patient fancy dress costume'.

Tesco said shortly after that it would be removing the 'Psycho Ward' costumes advertised on it own sites - a bright orange jumpsuit with the word 'Committed' on the back.

A number of traders on Amazon are also selling a range of "psycho" costumes for both adults and children, but the online retailer has yet to comment.

One, listed as a 'psycho costume', consists of a white shirt covered in 'blood', while another child's 'psycho surgeon' set shows a shirt and trouser set smeared with red paint.

Tesco said it was 'really sorry for any offence caused' by the costume, which was worn on its website by a model in a brown mask, holding a syringe.

The website description of the costume says: 'Dress up as the most thrilling psycho killer character of all time in this Psycho Ward costume, consisting of a bright orange, long-sleeved boiler suit with zip fastener to front, 'Psycho Ward' printed on the chest.

'The same words (are) printed on the back in larger letters with a prominent 'Committed' stamp just below.'

Inappropriate: Amazon.com also advertised a Psycho Ward costume - at a reduced price

Asda's 'mental patient' costume, 
which first provoked the storm, was designed to look like a 
blood-splattered straitjacket with ragged edges. It was on sale for £20 through the supermarket's clothing arm George.

Many
 took to Twitter to express their disgust at the description including 
former footballer Stan Collymore, who has a well-documented battle with 
depression.

He tweeted: 'Dear ASDA, nice stereotype of ' Mental patients'. Something you'd expect from the £££. A f***ing joke.

'Do you actually realise how many 
people are hanging themselves because of being frightened of the stigma?
 Wording is CLEAR. MENTAL PATIENT.'

Asda yesterday apologised for the incident in a series of tweets, and announced the large donation it had made today.

A spokesman for Asda declined to 
elaborate further on the donation, other than to say: 'This is a sincere
 gesture to apologise for the offence. We want to do this for the right 
reasons and not for publicity.'

The
 company said: 'We're deeply sorry one of our fancy dress costumes has 
upset people. This was an unacceptable error - the product was withdrawn
 immediately.

Bad taste: Supermarket giant Asda has been forced to apologise after it advertised a fancy dress outfit featuring someone covered in blood and brandishing a machete as a 'mental patient fancy dress costume'

'We'd like to offer our sincere apologies for the offence it's caused and will be making a sizeable donation to @MindCharity.

'We removed the product from our website this afternoon but unfortunately the page may remain visible for a few more hours.'

A Tesco spokesman said: 'We're really sorry for any offence this has caused and we are removing this product from sale.'

A spokesman said the 'Psycho Ward' costume was intended to refer
 to a 'film character' and that after complaints from customers it had 
been withdrawn from sale and from the company's website.

Former
 spin doctor Alistair Campbell, who has also suffered from depression, told BBC London 94.9: 'It underlines to me that we treat mental illness like it's not serious.
 I've had depression, I've had psychosis. Mental illness is scarier than
 most physical illnesses and I just cannot understand what goes through 
the minds of intelligent business people.

'We are trying to change attitudes towards mental illness... but we are still in the
 dark ages if some of the biggest companies in this country - Tesco, 
Asda, Amazon - think that it's acceptable to sell something like this. 
It's unacceptable on every level.'

Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of 
mental health charity SANE, said: 'We welcome Asda's withdrawal of the 
costume, which could only serve to reinforce prejudice and 
misperceptions of mental illness, leaving those already struggling with 
mental health problems more lonely and excluded.'

Outrage: Many took to Twitter to express their disgust at the description including former footballer Stan Collymore, who has a well-documented battle with depression

Stunned: Former Labour spin doctor and mental health charity Rethink were among the critics on Twitter

Paul Jenkins, chief executive of the 
charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: 'I am pleased to see Asda has now 
removed the costume from their website, but the fact it was ever there 
in the first place is completely unacceptable.

Sue Baker, campaigner for mental 
health charity Mind, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Nine out of 
ten people using mental health services in patient care report stigma 
and discrimination from a range of sources.

'Stigma and discrimination is 
unfortunately still really damaging in England today and this kind of 
myth of the dangerousness posed by people, that you should be scared of 
anyone who has used mental health services, is really damaging.

'(Asda) certainly crossed the line 
here and I hear it might well have been changed with the addition of 
mental patient, so it was definitely being used to tap into negative 
stereotypes.'

'This costume is breathtakingly 
insensitive, and it's shocking that Asda ever felt it was an appropriate
 product to sell. There is already so much stigma surrounding mental 
illness, and 'joke' products like this only serve to make things worse.'

Lucie Russell, director of campaigns 
at the charity YoungMinds, said: 'Asda has made a huge error of judgment
 in marketing this costume as 
'mental health patient'. This costume just makes it harder for children 
and young people to speak out and get help about mental health.

'One in  ten children and young people have a diagnosable mental health 
problem, with many more out there struggling without being diagnosed. We
 need to create a climate of support around children and young people, 
not fear.'

Mistake: Asda has now withdrawn the product after apologising for an 'unacceptable error'

The row comes as new figures show that more than 30,000 people with mental health problems are dying needlessly every year from causes other than suicide.

The Government estimates around 100,000 people under 75 die every year from illnesses that could have been prevented through better medical treatment or interventions like stop smoking campaigns.

A new report from the charity Rethink Mental Illness has found around a third of these deaths are among people with mental health problems.

They are more likely to die from preventable illness - such as cancer or heart disease - than the rest of the population.

The study, Lethal Discrimination, calls on the Government to do more to target this group, who have higher rates of illness through side-effects of medication, smoking, a lack of basic health checks on the NHS and professionals not taking their concerns seriously.
