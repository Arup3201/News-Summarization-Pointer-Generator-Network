In court: Stephen Briggs pleaded guilty to causing an animal unnecessary suffering and to criminal damage

A drunk father-of-three killed a pet guinea pig by throwing it against the wall of his house in front of his three horrified children.

Stephen Briggs, 31, lost his temper after one of his children burst into his garden shed where he had been drinking 16 cans of lager.

He threw an Xbox games console against a door, breaking a window, before hurling the guinea pig against the wall of his family’s home in Carlisle, Cumbria.

At the city’s magistrates’ court, 
Briggs pleaded guilty to causing a protected animal unnecessary 
suffering and to criminal damage.

Pam
Ward, prosecuting, described how the defendant, who owns several guinea
pigs, had started drinking lager in his shed at 2pm on July 12.

Briggs, whose children are aged seven, 10 and 11, polished off eight cans before going out to get another 10.

By 6pm, he had only two cans left and was drunk, said Mrs Ward.

She
continued: 'When one of the children entered the shed he became angry 
and then left the shed holding one of the guinea pigs, which he threw 
against the house wall.

'It didn’t die straight away.'

Realising that the three children were upset, the defendant’s partner came out into the garden.

When a police officer arrived, he saw one of the children holding the injured guinea pig, which moved slightly and then died.

Mrs Ward added: 'The mother of the children outlined what had happened but declined to make a formal written statement.'

Guilty: Stephen Briggs lost his temper and threw the guinea pig (not pictured) against the wall of his house in front of his three children after drinking 16 cans

When interviewed by police, Briggs said he had been drunk after consuming 16 cans of lager but he then became very upset, admitting that he had killed the guinea pig while the children were there.

In court, Briggs, now living at Guisborough, Cleveland, blamed his actions on his drinking, saying: 'I was in the wrong.'

He said he was now living with his parents and worried that his children might think he was evil. He added that he hopes to go back to his wife and family.

The case was adjourned for reports and Briggs will be sentenced on Monday, August 13.
