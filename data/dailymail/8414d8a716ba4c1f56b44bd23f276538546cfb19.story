The scale of the mammoth challenge facing authorities in the US following Superstorm Sandy was clear to see today in the flood-hit state of New Jersey.

National Guard troops arrived in the devastated city of Hoboken to help evacuate thousands of people still stuck in their homes. Trucks were delivering ready-to-eat meals and evacuating the area, across the 
Hudson River from New York City - half of which remains flooded two days after the storm struck.

Thousands of people are still holed up in their 
brownstones, condos, and other housing in the square city. The Mayor's spokesman said many people
are now asking to be evacuated. Payloaders have been used to get 
people out for medical emergencies but as the streets are so narrow they
can get stuck.

dry ground and powered by a backup generator.

Mayor Dawn Zimmer 
ordered an evacuation of basement and street-level units on Sunday.

Hoboken was hit hard by Superstorm 
Sandy, which flooded roughly half the town of 50,000 people.

Mayor Zimmer had pleaded for the Guard's help late on Monday, saying thousands
of residents were stuck in their homes.

'We have two payloaders and we're 
trying to go in where we can to help people, but we have small city 
streets and payloaders cannot fit down them', Mayor Zimmer said last night on MSNBC.

'We've got live wires in the waters, 
and the waters are completely contaminated and getting more 
contaminated,' she said.

'It's rain water mixed with sewage water; it's 
becoming more sewage water.'

NFL superstar Eli Manning, a quarterback for the New York Giants, lives in Hoboken and has also been hit by the rising waters.

remains out.

'Once the sun sets, complete darkness,' she told the Associated Press. 'You really can't see anything.'

PJ Molski, Hoboken resident

PJ Molski, a 25-year-old graphic 
designer who lives in Hoboken, said that his place is dry but that his 
car, which he left parked on a flooded street, won't start.

Almost every basement apartment he has seen in the small city, which makes the most of its housing stock, is flooded.

'There are just pumps going all over the city of people trying to get the water out of their basement apartments,' he said.

In a typical scene, along Grand Street
on Hoboken’s south side, cars can be seen partially submerged as 
residents lean out their windows waiting for help, reported The Star-Ledger.
