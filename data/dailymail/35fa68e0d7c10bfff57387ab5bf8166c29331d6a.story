A mother who stopped the execution of her son's killer as the noose was placed around his neck has described how the rage 'vanished from heart' as she slapped him.

Alinejad Hosseinzadeh, whose son Abdollah, 18, was murdered in a street fight, has described how she wanted her son's killer to die up until the final moments of his life.

She said the teenager, who died seven years ago, appeared to her in a dream 10 days before the execution and begged her to have mercy on his killer, known as Balal.

Last minute reprieve: Alinejad Hosseinzadeh slaps her son's killer after granting him clemency moments before he was supposed to be executed

Act of mercy: The victim's parents take the noose off the convict's neck after sparing his life, however, under Iranian law, the family does not have any say in the killer's jail sentence

Alinejad was supposed to kick the chair 
away from under him, but in a dramatic last minute reprieve, asked the 
rope to be removed and slapped him.

Her husband Abdolghan quickly lifted the noose and he was pardoned.

Alinejad described how her son appeared in a 
dream ten days before the execution, asking her to spare his life. He 
then appeared eight days later, but refused to talk to her.

Speaking to The Guardian, she said her decision to spare the killer's life did not come until moments before he was scheduled to die.

'I stood very firm in my belief that I want him punished, so they didn't expect me to forgive,' she said.

'Balal was naive. He didn't want to kill, it wasn't in his nature, he was angry in seconds and had a knife in his hand.

'All these years, I felt like a moving dead body. But now, I feel very calm, I feel I'm at peace. I feel that vengeance has left my heart.'

After the noose was removed, Balal's mother, Kobra, reached across the fence surrounding the execution site and hugged the victim's mother.

She then went to kiss Alinejad's feet, but the victim's mother stopped her saying 'she is a mother just like me'.

The victim's father, Abdolghani 
Hosseinzadeh, revealed his wife's actions were even more remarkable because they had lost another son in a motorbike crash when he was just 11 years old.

Despite the reprieve, Balal is still in jail. Under Iranian law, the victim's family can save a killer's life but cannot spare his prison term.

Pleas: People in the crowd shouted to the victim's family to forgive the killer and spare him from death

Spared: The killer, known as Balal, was sentenced to death for stabbing the 18-year-old victim during a street fight years ago
