British pop and film stars will boost the British economy by almost £9million an hour this year, the Government claimed today.

New albums from chart pin-ups Rita Ora, Ellie Goulding and Emeli Sande are included on a list of 'expected highlights of 2015' compiled by ministers.

British-made blockbusters are also expected to boost the economy –  including the new James Bond instalment, 'Spectre', out later in the year.

The list of cultural highlights was pulled together by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

It includes the new series of Downton Abbey and Game of Thrones as well as books and TV spin offs from writers like JK Rowling.

Ministers said Britain's creative industries - including films, music and TV shows - contributed £146,000 to the economy every minute in 2013, adding up to £76.9 billion a year, securing 1.7 million jobs.

Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, said: 'The UK's Creative Industries are recognised as world leaders around the globe and today's figures show that they continue to grow from strength to strength.

'They are one of our most powerful tools in driving growth, outperforming all other sectors of industry and their contribution to the UK economy is evident to all.

'Government is determined to continue its support for this most dynamic of sectors as part of our long-term economic plan.

'The tax reliefs we've got in place and are extending to Children's TV and orchestras have been instrumental in attracting inward investment, and are part of broad package of measures designed to ensure the continued success of the Creative Industries.'

The new James Bond film 'Spectre' will be released later this year and is expected to provide a boost to the British economy

The government welcomed the release of Mark Ronson's new album 'Uptown Special' - expected to be released on 19 January

Nicola Mendelsohn, of the Creative Industries Council, added: 'These latest figures highlight the great successes of the UK's Creative Industries with many developments, initiatives and international awards.

'The Creative Industries Council launched CreateUK last year - the first ever industry-led strategy to ensure growth and secure further jobs in the UK and internationally. It will also play an important role in exporting UK creativity to the rest of the world and encouraging inward investment here.

'2015 is set to be an exciting year with so many highlights to come. We're well placed to continue to secure the UK's place as a leading global hub for the Creative Industries for the decades to come.'
