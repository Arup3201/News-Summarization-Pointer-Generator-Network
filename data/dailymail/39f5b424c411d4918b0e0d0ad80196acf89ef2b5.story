While it is widely believed that caffeine will enhance concentration levels during exam preparation for students, over-consumption of the stimulant drug can have quite the opposite desired effect.

Dr Brian Morton, the Chair of the Australian Medical Association Council of General Practice, says excess intake of caffeinated drinks can decline a student's academic performance and also cause severe health-related consequences.

Serious cases include tremulous sensations, anxiety, heart palpitations and memory loss - all of which will interfere with the student's studies, the doctor said.

It is widely believed that caffeine will enhance concentration levels during exam preparation for students

With more than 75,000 Higher School Certificate students preparing to sit their first English paper on Monday, and with university exams fast approaching, Dr Morton says caffeine consumption increases this time of year.

But Dr Morton, who's been in the industry for more than 35 years, warns it is dangerous to drink more than four cups of coffee or caffeinated drinks a day.

If four standard caffeinated drinks must be consumed, each of about 120ml, he recommends to split them between the morning and afternoon - ensuring the last is consumed before 4pm.

'Students should use their common sense when consuming caffeine,' Dr Morton told Daily Mail Australia.

'Sensible doses should be taken which can help students to stay alert and concentrate.'

Dr Morton stressed the importance of sleep, a recommended seven to eight hours, which will also help enhance a student's performance.

'But while caffeine is known as a mild stimulant but it can also cause disturb sleep,' he said.

'Sleep deprivation can be detrimental to exam preparation and dare I say more so than knowing the subject for an exam.'

In severe cases of caffeine over-consumption, students put themselves at risk of serious health issues.

'The side-effects include headaches, lightheadedness, tremulous sensations in hands and body, anxiety, agitation and heart palpitations,' Dr Morton said.

'There can also be serious neurological effects including memory loss while caffeine toxicity can also cause seizures.' 

Consequently, the physical symptoms can distract the student's concentration level whilst sitting an exam.

Dr Morton urges students to avoid taking other stimulants like No Doz as it could have serious effects on students

As for other stimulants such as No Doz, popular caffeine tablets, Dr Morton advises students against these particular drugs.

'There's no good reason to take these [No Doz] as it has different chemicals in it and can react in different ways,' he said.

'Individuals have different tolerance levels so it can have a dangerous effect which can include landing a student in hospital.'
