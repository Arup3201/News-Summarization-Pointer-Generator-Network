A camera lost in a shipwreck two years ago off the coast of Vancouver Island has been recovered - and the memories it contains are miraculously intact.

Two students diving near Bamfield found the camera 40 feet underwater while diving for starfish as part of their research project.

One of them picked up the rusty, crusted camera, unaware of how long the device had been underwater.

Lost at sea: The camera was lost in a shipwreck two years ago

'One of them picked it up and put it in his pocket and kept counting the starfish,' one of the professors overseeing the dive told ABC.

'When they came up from the dive, he said, "Look what I found."'

Cote says she were fascinated by the many small marine creatures that had taken up residence in the camera.

The first thought Professor Siobhan Gray had, however, was whether or not there were still photographs on it.

She opened the device and found a memory card.

'I cleaned the contacts off of the (memory card) put it in my computer and it worked,' she told the Vancouver Sun.

They made posters of the video and tacked them up in the area in an effort to find the camera's owners, and lo and behold, a member of the Coast Guard recogized one of the men in a cheery group shot.

Intact: Unbelievably, the memory card still held all Paul Burgoyne's precious family photographs

Memories: Paul Burgoyne (center, back) was recognized by a Coast Guard who had rescued him when his ship Bootlegger sank of the coast of Vancouver Island

The man was Paul Burgoyne, a Vancouver artist who had been rescued by the Coast Guard two years earlier when the ship he was on, Bootlegger, sank on a 500-kilometre voyage from Vancouver to his summer home in Tahsis, B.C.

'That just shocked me,' Burgoyne told CBC. 'Getting the camera, or the photos back, that's really quite wonderful.'

When the ship went down, not only did Burgoyne lose his camera in the wreck, but precious memories it contained.

The last pictures he had taken was a family gathering to scatter his parents ashes at Lake of the Woods in Ontario.

Repurposed: While the camera will no longer perform its original function, it has proven to be a popular home for marine life

'I have a new respect for, you know, these electronics,' Burgoyne told CBC. 'You throw most of it away every two years, but that little card is an amazing bit of technology.'

Another item on the card is a video of calm seas that Burgoyne took just before his ship was wrecked.

One of Gray's acquaintances from the Coast Guard station had personally attended the Burgoyne's rescue, and was able to dig out his contact details.

He left a message for Burgoyne, who called Gray the following day.

'He was thrilled. He says when he got off the phone with the Coast Guard him and his wife were laughing a great deal and mentioned how lucky he was,' she told the Vancouver Sun.
