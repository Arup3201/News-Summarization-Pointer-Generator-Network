Britain is enjoying the hottest day of the year so far today with temperatures set to reach higher than in Greece and Italy.

Forecasters said the mercury is expected to rise as high as 24C, possibly even 25C, in much of England, while in Rome and Athens it is anticipated to be in the low 20s.

Retailers are bracing themselves for a run on BBQ food while thousands of people are likely to flock to beaches and parks to make the most of the sunshine before it becomes more unsettled next week.

'Tomorrow is set to be very similar, it could also be a little bit hotter. There will be more cloud across Wales and the south which will make the sunshine appear hazy.

Next week will become more unsettled with thundery showers anticipated all over the UK although overnight temperatures are also expected to stay warm.

Ms Roberts added: 'From Tuesday onwards the weather will become unsettled with heavy rain and showers expected across the whole of the UK. The south-east will still keep hold of the warm air. People should definitely make the most of the good weather this weekend.'
