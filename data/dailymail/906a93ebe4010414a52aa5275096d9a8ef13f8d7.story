Chancellor George Osborne has warned the British economy is not immune from the eurozone crisis

George Osborne yesterday warned that the British economy was at a ‘critical’ juncture as the eurozone plunged deeper into crisis.

The Chancellor said the UK was feeling the impact of the slowdown on its main trading partner amid warnings the single currency bloc faced a ‘lost decade’ like the one seen in Japan in the 1990s.

Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said the eurozone risked a devastating double-whammy of recession and deflation.

In her intervention at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank at their headquarters in Washington, she warned that the region faced full-blown recession if politicians failed to act now.

It came as Germany, Europe’s largest economy, suffered its biggest fall in exports for more than five years.

Exports tumbled 5.8 per cent in August – fuelling fears of recession across the region.

And a separate report showed German industrial output slumped 4 per cent in the same month – also the worst performance for five years.

Mr Osborne said the UK economy was slowing as the worsening situation on the Continent took its toll.

‘This is a critical moment for the British economy,’ he said. ‘The eurozone risks slipping back into recession. Britain cannot be immune from that. Indeed, it’s already having an impact on our manufacturing and our exports.’

Yesterday the Bank of England held interest rates at 0.5 per cent in a sign that it did not think Britain was ready to withstand higher borrowing costs.

This week the IMF slashed its growth forecasts for the eurozone and said there was a 40 per cent chance of recession – which would be the third since the financial crisis six years ago.

It also warned of a devastating bout of deflation or falling prices that would delay spending, hit profits and cost jobs.

Japan suffered a lost decade of stagnation and falling prices from which it never fully recovered.

Christine Lagarde, manager of the International Monetary Fund, said there was a 'serious risk' the eurozone was heading towards recession if nothing was done to stop the slowdown

Asked yesterday if the eurozone was ‘the new Japan’, Miss Lagarde said: ‘We have alerted to the risk of persistent low inflation, which is one of the attributes of what you have described as the new Japan.

'We have also alerted to the potential risk of recession in the eurozone. We are not suggesting the eurozone is heading toward recession but we are saying there is a serious risk of that happening if nothing is done.’ 

At loggerheads: Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande have clashed over EU austerity rules

French President Francois Hollande has issued a plea to Angela Merkel to ease austerity rules, claiming they could stifle growth.

He also said the EU should provide £16billion to boost jobs over the next six years.

‘If everyone practises austerity, which isn’t the case with France, we’ll end up with an even greater slowdown,’ Mr Hollande told a jobs summit in Milan.

The socialist president is under immense pressure after admitting France would break EU rules against running a budget deficit of more than 3 per cent of national income.

France now faces having its budget torn up by the European Commission this month.

But the German Chancellor rejected Mr Hollande’s calls, insisting the rules should be met.
