A woman who claims she had a 'drunken fumble' with Prince Harry at his now-infamous naked party in Las Vegas can today be revealed as a dominatrix who charges $1,000 an hour for BDSM sessions.

British-born Carrie Reichert, 40, offers kinky fun as a dominatrix under the name Lady Dominique and bills herself as a 'mistress of pain'.

Her sordid secret was revealed after the Daily Mail Online obtained X-rated videos of Reichert – who is also a pole-dancer going by the name Carrie Royale – spanking and whipping a man during a wild session.

'Mistriss of pain': British-born Carrie Reichert offers kinky fun as a dominatrix under the name Lady Dominique. She is the only woman to come forward to claim that she partied with Prince Harry in Vegas.

 Prince Harry, pictured above in Las Vegas in 2012, was said to have invited 10 women to party with him at his VIP suite at the Encore at Wynn hotel, including Miss Reichert

Dressed in raunchy bondage gear, Reichert likes to belittle and humiliate her clients – earning up to $5,000 a time.

In the video she wears a black PVC basque, knee-high boots and circles a bound, naked, masked man as he pants and cowers on the floor.

She tells the whimpering man, 'You're so pathetic' before spanking him with a black paddle whip.

Reichert claims she kissed a naked Prince Harry in a 20-minute 'drunken fumble' at his penthouse hotel room during the famous Las Vegas party in August 2012.

She said in a newspaper interview at the time: 'We kissed, he was naked at the time, and pretty open. It was a drunken fumble. It wasn't romantic, just fun.

'He was a gentleman, but he was so wasted. The alcohol affected him. I was there for 15 to 20 minutes.'

Now it can be revealed that the blonde charges $5,000 to $10,000 dollars for private BDSM sessions in her New Orleans apartment.

A source said: 'Carrie [who also uses the code name Ms X] has a dungeon in a room at her place with big bed restraints and a St Andrew's cross which she ties men to and whips them.

'She also has Christian Grey-style racks with all her instruments and sex toys laid out on them - like paddles, nipple clamps and cat-of-nine-tail whips.

'She charges $1,000 for appearances at parties and for private sessions she can earn as much as $5,000 depending on how extreme the client wants to go.

'Recently she filmed a series of X-rated DVDs for her private clients.

'Rarely does she have sex with clients - she's had some really strange people so far but she enjoys it.'

Earlier this year, Reichert performed a striptease show in which she used underpants she claimed belonged to Prince Harry.

The routine – which she performed at the Harry Mohney Erotic Heritage Museum in Las Vegas in January – involved her taking off the outfit she wore on the night she allegedly met the young royal before twirling the underpants she claims he gifted to her.

Reichert, who lied that she was 32 when she spoke about the royal party in 2012, claims she has now donated the underpants, along with a string bikini she wore, to the museum.

Kensington Palace has previously denied Reichert was one of 10 women invited back to the Prince's VIP suite at the Encore at Wynn hotel and dismissed her story as 'untrue'.

Reichert is the only woman to have ever spoken out about the prince's wild night.

She claims she was hand picked by a member of the royal entourage as she hung out by the pool at the Encore and invited to the Prince's penthouse suite.

The dominatrix previously told how Prince Harry was already naked when she entered the room and was playing air guitar with a pool cue and giving 'random naked hugs'.

Among other shocking claims she made at the time, the pole dancer said that high-spirited Harry pressed his naked body up against the giant window of his suite and declared: 'Look at me, Vegas, these are the royal jewels.'

Later, the prince was photographed on a cell phone wearing nothing but a necklace while a naked female guest hid behind him during a game of strip pool.

Another photo showed him giving the same topless woman a naked bear hug.

The photos - which have since been seen by tens of millions across the world – caused acute embarrassment for the royal family as well as raising security fears about how well the prince was protected on his Vegas trip.

Just weeks after the party, Reichert spent a month in Harrison County Jail in Mississippi after being arrested for a $22,000 check fraud.
