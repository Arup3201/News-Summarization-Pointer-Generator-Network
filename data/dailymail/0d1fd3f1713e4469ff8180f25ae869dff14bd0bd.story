If the hectic pace of life and international travel is getting too much – British Airways believes it has the answer to calm you down – ‘Slow TV’.

Forget the action packed shoot ‘em up ’ Hollywood blockbusters, the Star Wars-style space epics or break-neck speed car chases.

BA bosses reckon many passengers while cruising at 600mph and 35,000ft would rather unwind and de-stress on a lengthy flight to the on-screen equivalent of watching paint dry.

So from next week they are to screen an entire seven-hour-long silent snow-covered train journey from Bergen to Oslo in Norway and believe  passengers will appreciate the   calming, hypnotic and  ‘mesmerising’ qualities of the quiet meandering programme that is void of commentary to liven things up.

BA will be the first  airline to  air such languid ‘Slow TV’ alternative to the usual fare of 130 movies, 650 TV shows, 550 music albums and 228 radio shows.

They were inspired in part by the popularity of the highly addictive slow-moving in-flight screens which show the aeroplane’s progress across a  map  as well as key statistics such as temperature, speed and time.

The journey-within-a-journey was also inspired by a wider trend for ‘slow TV’ which is already popular in Scandinavia for its relaxing, undemanding qualities.

The programmes also feature gentle, everyday events such as knitting, walking and bird feeding.

For those of a certain  vintage,  the idea will bring back memories of the highly popular and equally hypnotic  spinning  ‘potters’ wheel’ – used in the early days of black and white television for the ‘interlude’ used between programmes -  showing a pair of hands fashioning a clay  pot.

Next in line will be an eight hour epic taking the passenger on a journey to see the entire process of knitting  a jumper - from the shearing of sheep to the finished product

British Airways said staff would trial the train journey before expanding to other ‘slow’ programmes.

Next in line will be an eight hour epic taking  the passenger on a journey to see the entire process of knitting a jumper - from the shearing of sheep to the finished product.

The genre has already become a cult hit in Norway, with more than a million people tuning in to the programme called ‘The Seven Hour Train Journey to Oslo’ when it ran on Norwegian TV station NRK.

BA’s  in-flight entertainment manager Richard D’Cruze  said one of the team at their  agency Spafax read about this unusual documentary that had become a cult hit in Norway and tracked it down: ‘It fits perfectly with the ‘wallpaper’ style footage people find mesmerising in-flight, such as our moving maps which customers watch for endless hours.  

Highlights include children waving from stations, the changing weather, and stretches of total darkness as the train passes through long tunnels

‘There’s definitely a hypnotic, calming and entertaining quality to ‘Slow TV’ that is perfect for in-flight entertainment.’

The quiet film uses a camera mounted on the front of an ordinary train, and shows its journey through stations, countryside, past picturesque lakes and underneath snow-capped mountains.

Last year, NRK found itself with an unexpected hit after broadcasting the show to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the train route.

Head of programming at the public service broadcaster Rune Møklebust said he had commissioned it after a colleague suggested filming the whole trip: ‘We thought it would be something completely new… and cheap,’ he said after putting it up against more popular  fare such as the ‘X Factor’ and ‘Have I Got News For You’.

He revealed: ‘Miraculously, we got more viewers. All these people wrote in to say, 'I only meant to tune in for a minute but I watched for hours.'’

The channel went on to mount 11 cameras on the side of a cruise ship and broadcast the views from a five-and-a-half day journey along the Norwegian coast, attracting 3.2million viewers.

Other hits have included a 24-hour salmon fishing special, a 12-hour show about a fire being built and lit, a boat trip spanning 379 hours and the  eight-hour-long documentary about knitting.

Arve Hjelseth, a sociologist from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, attributed the success of the shows to a renewed appreciation for nature in modern society, adding: ‘We're more stressed these days, too, so it's a time to relax as well as an antidote to modern TV, where camera angles shift every second. So called 'slow-TV' is strangely calming.’
