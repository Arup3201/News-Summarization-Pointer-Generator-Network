We all know that the perfect way to finish a meal is with a strong cup of espresso, but we also know that this is followed with a night of tossing and turning.

However, now coffee lovers can indulge in a flavourful hot drink in the evening without the caffeinated side effect as a revolutionary new beverage is unveiled.

The espresso looks just like a regular shot of coffee however it is crafted entirely from tea.

Can you tea-leaf it? The Red Espresso is made using caffeine free Rooibos leaves 

The drink is created using ground Rooibos leaves, a tea bush that only grows in a tiny corner of the Western Cape in South America.

It is made by forcing water through Rooibos grounds at high pressure creating a drink that has the same thick and creamy look of an espresso minus the caffeine.

The ingenious beverage, called Red Espresso, is not only caffeine-free but boasts five times the antioxidants of green tea.

Old favourites: The Red Espresso can be used to create barista favourites such as cappuccinos and lattes

Coffee lover Carl Pretorious, came up with the invention for Red Espresso after realising his habit of six espressos a morning was affecting his health.

The idea came to him  when he spotted a bag of Rooibos tea, a staple in his native South Africa, and decided to experiment by putting the leaves in his espresso machine.

Since then he has managed to refine the brew into an intense drink with a creamy layer of foam just like his favourite caffeinated drink of choice.

However, unlike his usually coffee fueled morning his new drink of choice aids his health rather than damages it.

The concentrated tea leaves are full of antioxidants that can help aid digestion, sooth headaches and boost the immune system. 

Natasha Lache, Red Espresso's global brand manager, says that Carl's invention is incredibly easy to use and is competitive with many devices. 

'The leaves are ground into a special patented espresso grind and it then works like any other ground coffee - you can use it in an espresso machine, a French press or a stove-top pot.'

The versatile tea can also be used to recreate caffeine free versions of your favourite barista treats. 

'You can use it to make all your favourite coffee drinks like a cappuccinos, Americano, macchiato or latte.

'It tastes amazing and it's got five times the antioxidants of green tea.'

Natasha believes that Carl's invention can satisfy any coffee drinker as he himself was such a die-hard fan of the stuff before making the change to the tea espressos.  

'He (Carl) realised he was drinking too much caffeine but didn't want to switch to decaf.

Versatile: As well as a coffee machine the Red Espresso can be used in a cafetiere

'One morning he saw a bag of Rooibos tea next to his espresso machine and thought 'what if I put the two together'.

'He then spent a lot of time finding the best Rooibos tea and working on perfecting it. The result is Red Espresso - it's the best of both worlds.

'It meets a real desire for the coffee lifestyle with fantastic health benefits without any compromise in taste or style.

'Red Espresso has been a real hit with coffee and drinkers.' 

Red Espresso costs £4.49 for a 250g pouch and can be bought online from Cream Supplies.
