All around her are the signs of chaos and destruction, buildings reduced to rubble, walls riddled with bullet holes.

A slab of concrete sticks up precariously from the ground, perhaps the result of an airstrike or mortar attack.

Yet right beside it, sitting dutifully at a table, the little girl smiles warmly as she sells round loaves of bread, a tiny slice of normality for the citizens of the beleaguered city of Deir al-Zor.

Defiant: A girl sits amid the rubble and destruction as she sells bread on a damaged street in Deir al-Zor, Syria

The truly humbling image, captured last week by Reuters photographer Khalil Ashawi, offers a rare glimmer of hope that, despite the violence and destruction things can return to normal.

Deir al-Zor, in a key oil region in the east of the country, has been the scene of fierce fighting with skirmishes between Free Syrian Army soldiers and government forces reported as recently as this week.

The surrounding area is now under the control of a lose network of tribes who have seized control of the oilfields and have been exploiting the instability by smuggling barrels of crude into Turkey.

Last week video emerged appearing to show a Syrian rebel cutting out and eating the heart of a dead government soldier.

The
 unverified clip, posted by a pro-government campaign group, claims to 
show a man - believed to be Abu Sakkar, the well-known founder of Homs' 
Farouq Brigade - standing over the uniformed corpse in a ditch while 
ranting against President Bashar al Assad.

Using a knife, the man hacks open the torso and removes two organs before holding them up to the camera and declaring: 'I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your livers, you soldiers of Bashar the dog.' He then raises one to his mouth and takes a bite.

According to the London-based Syrian Network of Human Rights, 7543 women including 2454 girls child and 257 infants have been killed by Syrian Government's Armed Forces.

Today the U.N. General Assembly is expected to approve an Arab-backed resolution calling for a political transition in Syria and strongly condemning President Bashar Assad's regime for its escalating use of heavy weapons.

The 193-member world body is scheduled to vote Wednesday morning on the resolution which also condemns Syria's 'gross violations' of human rights, assembly spokesman Nikola Jovanovic said.

The Arab group decided to seek 
approval for a resolution in the General Assembly to reflect 
international dismay at the increasing death toll, now more than 70,000,
 and the failure to end the ongoing conflict.

Unlike Security Council resolutions, which are legally binding, General Assembly resolutions cannot be enforced.

But
 approval of an assembly resolution would counter the paralysis of the 
deeply divided Security Council, where Syria's allies, Russia and China,
 have vetoed three Western-backed resolutions aimed at pressuring Assad 
to end the violence.

Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin has sent letters urging all U.N. members to vote 'no' on the new resolution.

He called it 'one-sided and biased' as well as 'counterproductive' given the understanding reached by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Moscow earlier this month to convene a follow-up international meeting on a political transition in Syria.

Argentina's U.N. Ambassador Maria Cristina Perceval, asked Qatar, the lead sponsor, to water down language welcoming the establishment of the Syrian National Coalition, the main opposition group, and to eliminate a reference to 'the wide international acknowledgment' that it is the legitimate representative of the Syrian people.

She said in a letter, written on behalf of a group of Latin American countries, that they also objected to language welcoming Arab League resolutions on a political resolution of the situation in Syria because Latin American countries didn't participate in their adoption.

Perceval also demanded that language be inserted 'explicitly calling for no further militarization of the conflict.'

But the Qataris refused to make any 
of these requested changes, putting support from this group of Latin 
American countries in doubt.

The
 last Arab-sponsored General Assembly resolution in August was approved 
by an overwhelming vote of 133-12 with 31 abstentions.

It strongly condemned Syria's use of heavy weapons, deplored the Security Council's failure to act, said Syria must take the first steps to stop the violence, and stressed that rapid progress on a political transition represented the 'best opportunity' to resolve the crisis peacefully.

Diplomats predicted that the 
resolution being voted on Wednesday will get a reduced majority of 
between 100 and 110 'yes' votes because of concerns about the divided 
opposition.

Using 
similar language to the August resolution, the proposed new resolution 
stresses that 'rapid progress on a political transition represents the 
best opportunity' to resolve the Syrian conflict peacefully.

It would promote the roadmap for a Syrian transition adopted at a meeting on June 30, 2012 in Geneva by key nations including the five veto-wielding council powers - the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France.

The roadmap starts with the establishment of a transitional governing body vested with full executive powers and ends with elections - but there has been no agreement on how to implement it, which would require Assad to relinquish power at some unspecified point.

The draft resolution would reiterate the General Assembly's call 'for an inclusive Syrian-led political transition to a democratic, pluralistic political system, in which citizens are equal regardless of their affiliations or ethnicities or beliefs.'

It says this should be done by starting 'a serious political dialogue between credible, empowered, and mutually acceptable interlocutors representing the Syrian authorities and the Syrian opposition.'

The draft strongly condemns the continued escalation in the Syrian regime's use of heavy weapons, including indiscriminate shelling from tanks and aircraft, as well as the use of ballistic missiles, cluster munitions and other weapons against populated areas.

It expresses 'grave concern at the threat by the Syrian authorities to use chemical or biological weapons, as well as at allegations of reported use of such weapons.'

It demands that Syria 'strictly observe' international laws prohibiting the use of chemical and biological weapons and refrains from transferring such weapons 'to non-state actors.'

Syria has said if it had such weapons, it would never use them against its own people.
