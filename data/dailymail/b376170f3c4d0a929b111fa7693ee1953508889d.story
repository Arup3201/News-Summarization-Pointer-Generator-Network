New Zealand Rugby League officials have slammed the Australian junior team for their 'provocative and disrespectful' reaction to a pre-match haka after a brawl almost broke out between the Junior Kiwis and Junior Kangaroos.

Officials had to step in to separate the two teams after they started pushing and shoving each other following the traditional pre-game challenge at Mt Smart Stadium in Auckland on Saturday night.

NZ Rugby League president Howie Tamati described the incident as disappointing.

'In regard to the actions of the Australian boys to walk up and get in the New Zealand boys faces, that was really provocative and disrespectful,' Mr Tamati told stuff.co.nz.

He added that the haka was misunderstood to be 'all about war'.

'The haka can be many things... But the battle is to come, the game is to come. It's not a situation where you're looking to fight.

'That was disrespectful by the Australians, and deliberately so I would say.'

Junior Kiwis coach Brent Gemmell said the Australian team stepped too far forward before the New Zealand team started advancing to perform their haka, which saw the two teams come face to face and 'over-hyped things'.

He said a new protocol of a 10m gap between teams should be introduced for future games.

Both teams were standing toe to toe while the young Australian players linked arms during the performance on Saturday, which Australian media described as 'the most aggressive haka of all time'.

'That was interesting viewing for sure,' Mr Gemmell told NZ Herald. 

'When I saw Australia advance and they crossed halfway and I knew our boys were still to walk forward and still to stick a hand out at them.

'I thought this could potentially turn really sour but it calmed down and we got on with the footy which was good.'

New Zealand beat Australia 15-14 with a field goal in the last minute of the game.
