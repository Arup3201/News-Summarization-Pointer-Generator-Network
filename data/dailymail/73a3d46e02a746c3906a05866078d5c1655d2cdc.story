When Boston bombing victim Erika Brannock left hospital on Monday, she thanked her support team but asked for one final favor: To help find the woman who had saved her life that day.

She only remembered the woman as 'Joan from California' but after a plea from CNN to its viewers, the hero has been tracked down, and has been identified as Amanda North from the Bay area.

North, who is in her 50s and has two children, can be seen in photographs beside Brannock's injured body on April 15, giving EMTs a belt for tourniquet to stop the blood from her badly mangled leg.

Brannock, a pre-school teacher from Maryland, needed her left leg amputated above the knee and also lost part of the bone from her right leg. She was the last victim to leave hospital on Monday.

As she left, she told theÂ Boston Globe
that after the bomb blasts, a woman approached her with a belt for a 
tourniquet and said: 'I'm Joan from California, and I'm not going to let
you go.'

'She had short 
brown hair and a yellow jacket,' Brannock said, adding that she was 
desperate to find her. 'I honestly don't believe I'd be here if it 
weren't for her.'

On Monday night, CNN decided
to help her and posted an image to Facebook of the woman beside 
Brannock following the blast. It was shared more than 1,500 by people 
from across the country.

Then
the woman herself - now identified as Amanda North - emailed the 
network with the subject: 'That's me!' She had received text messages 
from friends who had seen the segment on AC 360.

Search: Anderson Cooper's team asked if anyone knew the woman, believed to be called 'Joan'

North's niece, sister-in-law and a friend confirmed her identity in emails to the network.

As Brannock suffered a perforated eardrum, she misheard North's name. North, who also suffered hearing loss from the blast, likewise believed that the woman she helped was called 'Irene'.

North was later treated at hospital for cuts and lacerations, and also had badly singed hair, which she cut. But CNN reported that she was so busy helping Erika she did not even realize she was hurt.

She told CNN she had been at the marathon to support her daughter, a Harvard student, in the race.

Reporter Randi Kaye told Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night that the woman was overcome with emotion when they contacted her about Brannock.

Injured: Erika lost her left leg above the knee and bone in her right leg and suffered burns and loss of hearing

'She was so choked up,' Kaye said. 'She said that she's been thinking about Erika since the marathon. She had no idea what happened to her. She didn't even know if she survived.

'She did want us to give a message to Erika: That she never stopped holding her hand.'

North added that her life was transformed on the day of the bombings.

The network has arranged for the women 
to be reunited in Baltimore, where Erika is still receiving treatment, 
and will air their meeting on Anderson Cooper 360 on Wednesday evening.

Brannock
was hit by the blast as she waited by the finish line with her sister 
and brother-in-law for their mother to complete the Boston Marathon.

Heading home: Brannock leaves hospital - where she had been for 50 days - on Monday with her mother

An image of sister, Nicole Gross, 31, surrounded by blood and with her face awash with terror featured on newspapers across the world. She suffered serious leg injuries.

Brannock herself underwent more than 10 surgeries, including the amputation of her left leg above the knee. She has also lost bone in her right leg and suffered burns and loss of hearing.

She is now wheelchair bound and will move in with her mother, Carol Downing, to her home in Monkton, Maryland while she continues undergoing physical therapy.
