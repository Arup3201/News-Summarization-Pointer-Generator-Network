Bending down for those household chores was causing her elderly mother some pain.

But rather than employing a carer, Kathryn Hoffman found another way to help 94-year-old Elsie Talbot - of the four-legged variety, that is.

And Mrs Hoffman, 66, has trained her dog Fergus to lend a hand - or, rather, paw - whenever her aging mother comes to stay at her house.

It means Mrs Talbot, whose 95th birthday is not far off, needn't stoop to pull a load out of the washing machine. Nor should she fret if she forgets where she left her keys is - a simple call to Fergus will see the missing item come running.

And in those moments when the television remote control is just out of reach, the gentle-natured dog is there to help and stop her stretching to the point of pain.

Of course, it was never planned this way. And Mrs Hoffman and her husband Bob first got the four-year-old Labradoodle as company for their lonely German Shepherd after another dog died.

But when the inquisitive pup kept on sticking his head in the washing machine, and slobbering over household appliances, it dawned on Mrs Hoffman that she could put him to good use.

'My mum is elderly and I thought actually he could, say she was staying here and I'd gone to work he could do things for her,' the retired probation service worker explained.

'She's almost 95 so some things are a bit difficult so I thought it would be a real help if he could do things like empty the washing machine.'

So she set to work, and with some gentle coaxing - in the form of chicken-flavoured nugget treats – she taught him to pull socks and pants from the bowl and drop them into a laundry basket.

Inspired, no doubt, and sensing an opportunity for more, Mrs Hoffman tried it out with some keys, this time coating them in cat mint - a special scent that is familiar to hounds.

Low and behold, Fergus was soon able to delve into her handbag and find them, at the simple command of 'keys'.

And his skills transferred to remote controls, newspapers and slippers, which Fergus will place - slightly slobbered - into an outstretched hand.

Mrs Hoffman said: 'She could say "I've dropped my paper, Fergus, bring it", and he'd bring it to her. Or if she needed the remote passing or couldn't find her slippers or keys, she could ask Fergus for them.'

Of course, whetting Fergus' appetite for household objects has had its ups and downs.

And curiosity got the better of him one day last year when he happened upon a mobile phone in Mrs Hoffman's bag, while she was getting ready to visit her daughter.

'He went into the handbag, took my mobile out, and when I came back in it was open, the whole thing,' she said. 'So I snapped it shut, put it in my bag and drove off.'

At the time she didn't think anything of it, and it wasn't until the phone failed to function the following day that Mrs Hoffman discovered the battery was missing.

When she returned home to search for the lost piece, however, it appeared to have vanished. But a trip to the vets soon solved the mystery - Fergus had swallowed the battery.

'Thankfully, before I'd even realised that he'd swallowed it, it had passed through him,' Mrs Hoffman said. 'Otherwise it would have been an extremely big operation.'

Since then, however, Fergus has learned his lesson. And his seemingly endless appetite – which has seen him reach 35kg - is now reserved for the treats he gets for the successful completion of a trick.

And in recent weeks he has scoffed even more than usual, learning new skills as part of Superstar Dogs - a TV show seeking to find the country's most able hound.

The show, which started last week on Channel 4, is sponsored by Be Lungworm Aware and hosted by former Torchwood actor John Barrowman. The series will see dog pairs compete in events such as swimming, jumping and agility.

The successful dogs will go through to the semi-final and final next week to compete for £1,000 in reward money.
