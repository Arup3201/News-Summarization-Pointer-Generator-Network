Police, health and ambulance services are being secretly privatised by the coalition government, Labour claimed today.

Seeking to capitalise on Ed Miliband’s speech which aggressively attacked the Conservative’s stewardship of public services, the party today stepped up its criticism of private firms being handed multi-million contracts to replace state workers.

They claim ministers have failed to learn the lessons of bungled contracts and broken promises, seen most recently when private security firm G4S failed to deliver thousands of security staff for the London Olympics.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper attacked plans to allow private firms to police the streets

Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, warned that contracts were being signed this week to take more than 300 community services out of the NHS altogether.

And shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Labour would limit the privatisation of the police as she seeks to assume the mantle of former Conservative Home Secretary Robert Peel.

It comes a day after Mr Miliband attempted to steal the ‘One Nation’ slogan from Benjamin Disraeli, another Tory figure from the nineteenth-century.

Ms Cooper claims the Tories are no longer the party of Peel, the man who, as Home Secretary, established the Metropolitan Police.

Police failings in investigating phone hacking, the Hillsborough tragedy and the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protest demoanstrate the need for a new, more powerful watchdog, Yvette Cooper said today.

The shadow home secretary said a Labour government would abolish the Independent Police Complaints Commission and create a stronger Police Standards Authority ‘to raise standards, pursue powerful investigations and ensure there are proper safeguards in place’.

Ms Cooper told the Labour conference in Manchester: ‘It took too long to get a new hacking investigation underway.

‘It took too long for the truth to come out about what happened to Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protest.

‘And it took far, far, far too long for the truth to come out about the tragedy and senior police cover up at Hillsborough.

‘Liverpool needs justice. But we also need to make sure no one ever, ever again has to fight for the truth for 23 years after losing a loved one or child.’

She says Labour in power would reverse Conservative reforms which have made it easier for private companies to bid for neighbourhood patrols and even detective work, adding: ‘We don’t want private companies patrolling the public streets of Britain.’

This is at odds with the ‘British policing model’, under which the police force is publicly run and takes place with the consent of the public – not imposed from above in a militaristic fashion.

‘Labour police and crime commissioners will halt this Tory rush to the privatisation of our police,’ she said. ‘Tory ministers want huge swathes of policing handed over to private companies.

'Nothing ruled out. Contract tenders which include neighbourhood patrols, detective investigations and more. Pushing forces to sign up to massive contracts with a single organisation where value for money is at risk.

‘Have they learned nothing from the Olympics?’

Miss Cooper admitted that public-private partnerships can be acceptable in areas such as new technology.

But she warned: ‘Policing by consent means the police need the confidence of the public. And the public need to know that policing is in the interests of the community not just the terms of the contract.

‘Policing in the interests of justice, not just the corporate balance sheet.

‘We don’t want private companies patrolling the public streets of Britain.

'We want police officers and PCSOs policing our communities – not private companies putting them under guard.’

Ms Cooper also paid tribute to Manchester police officers PC Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone who were killed on duty last month.

'They answered a 999 call as police officers do every single day of the week, not knowing what they will find.

'They were shot down in a brutal act. They showed bravery they and other emergency services take for granted, but that we never must.'

PC Hughes' funeral was being held in Manchester Cathedral today and PC Bone's is being held tomorrow.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham claimed the NHS is facing its 'biggest act of privatisation ever seen'

Labour today also sought to exploit Tory trust on the NHS, accusing Mr Cameron of a ‘great NHS carve-up’.

Data released under Freedom of Information laws show contracts worth £250million for 396 health services across England, including diagnostic testing, podiatry and adult hearing, are being handed to private firms.

Mr Burnham branded it the ‘biggest act of privatisation ever seen in the NHS’.

He received a standing ovation for warning of the threat to the health service.

'The N in NHS under sustained attack,' he told delegates.

'A postcode lottery running riot - older people denied cataract and hip operations.  NHS privatisation at a pace and scale never seen before.

'Be warned – Cameron’s Great NHS Carve-Up is coming to your community.

'As we speak, contracts are being signed in the single biggest act of privatisation the NHS has ever seen.'

A third of health trusts said they would not have looked to privatise the services without a new ruling from ministers that they must offer three services from a list of eight to tender.

Mr Burnham also published details of a bus company taking over non-emergency ambulance services in Greater Manchester and a HealthWatch patient advocacy service being outsourced in Lancashire.He called for an end to health trusts having to put services out to tender under the Any Qualified Provider rules.

But he was unable to give a clear list of services Labour would prevent from being privatised in future and admitted the last government 'let the market in too far'.

‘Since we were in government the debate has changed about the private sector and it’s reliability,’ Mr Burnham said, pointing to G4S, the banking crisis and the PIP breast implant scandal.

‘While you can take some risks in other areas you cannot take risks in healthcare.

‘I have always felt there are limits to the market in healthcare. It is different because people’s lives depend on it.’
