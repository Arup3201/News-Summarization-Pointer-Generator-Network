Former England captain and QPR defender Rio Ferdinand plans to retire from football at the end of the season.

But the 35-year-old says that while this season with Rangers will likely be his last as a player, he is keen to go into coaching.

'I probably think the end of this season,' Ferdinand said when asked about retirement on The Jonathan Ross Show, due to be broadcast on Saturday.

'I'm not fearful of retirement, I'm looking forward to it, I can see some good stuff hopefully happening ahead.

'You get to a time where you start understanding your body and the strains playing football (is) putting your body through, going out and training every day.'

The former West Ham, Leeds and Manchester United centre back, who has worked as a pundit, expects to stay involved in football in some capacity and has begun his coaching badges.

'I've done it for so many years, it's what I love,' he added.

'I will stay in football I'm sure in some capacity. I've signed to BT and stuff and I've done stuff with the BBC at the World Cup which I really enjoyed and it's something I'm sure I will take up and do a bit more (of).

'I'm doing my (coaching) badges as well and there are other bits and pieces outside of football.'

Ferdinand spent 12 years at United, winning six Premier League titles as well as the Champions League

Ferdinand was an unused substitute in last weekend's loss to Liverpool and could be confined to the bench again for Monday's match at home to Aston Villa.

Adel Taarabt could be offered the opportunity to prove himself to Harry Redknapp after the pair's public disagreement this week, when the QPR boss accused the Moroccan playmaker of being overweight.

Defender Nedum Onuoha hopes to shake off a hamstring problem sustained against Liverpool, midfielders Joey Barton and Jordon Mutch could be fit again after recent hamstring trouble, but Alejandro Faurlin (knee) is a long-term injury absentee.

In February 2010, Ferdinand replaced Chelsea's John terry as captain of England
