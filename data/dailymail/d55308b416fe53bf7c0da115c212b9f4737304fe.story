Two elderly sisters went on a road trip through Eastern Oregon last week, but after getting stuck in a snowdrift and walking for 12 hours for help, only one of the women made it back alive.

Stella Adamson, 72, and her sister Sue Blake, 83, both of Vancouver, Washington, were riding in their silver Toyota when they got stranded May 13 on a scenic forest road about 8 miles west of the North Fork Campground in northeast Grant County, Sheriff Glenn Palmer said in a statement.

Speaking to the station KPTV, Sue Blake recalled that she and her younger sister tried to dig out their car with every available tool, from their bare hands to plastic cups and even car mats, but the SUV would not budge.

The women spent the night in the car bundled up in all the clothes they had on hand, then set out at 6am May 14 and walked to the campground for 12 hours.

All the women had with them was a plastic water bottle filled with snow to keep them hydrated and a box of Wheat Thins crackers.Â 

Adamson fashioned a cane out of a stick she had found to help her walk. Mrs Blake recalled that her sister was in good spirits, and the two even joked how they were two old ladies on a hike.

To protect themselves from the sun, the women cut up Blake's T-shirt, soaked the strips of fabric in water and tied them around their heads to stay cool.

As they slowly made their way to the North Fork Campground, the siblings discussed plans for future trips together.

Blake also confided in Adamson that she felt guilty for getting them stranded because she was the one driving, but Adamson pointed out that it was she who decided to take the scenic route through a forest.

Upon reaching their destination 12 hours later, they found Robert Nelson and his wife camping. Nelson, of Cove, is a member of the Union County sheriff's search and rescue unit.

The couple fed and sheltered the exhausted women, turning the table in their camper into a bed. Nelson said he would try to help them retrieve their car the next day.

About 10pm that night, Stella Adamson complained of chest pains, Palmer said.

Tragic: Adamson was said to be in good spirits throughout the arduous 8-mile hike to a campground, but soon after she complained of chest pains and died on her way to the hospital

Unable to get a cell phone signal, or contact emergency services with a hand-held radio, Nelson drove the ailing woman to a Baker City hospital, where she was pronounced dead. She would have turned 73 Friday.

Nelson later helped Sue Blake retrieve her silver Toyota, the sheriff said.

Mrs Blake said that even though her and Adamson's East Oregon adventure ended in tragedy, she was grateful that the two of them had a chance to bond one final time.
