Former  Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has said that she still has not made up her mind whether or not to run for President ahead of next year's elections.

The 47-year-old spoke with reporters last night in 
the small Iowa town of Pella, where she and her husband attended 
the first public screening of a film about her rise in politics, called The Undefeated, and she dismissed comments from her daughter that she's made up her mind about running.

Her daughter, Bristol, had said in an earlier television interview that her mother had made up her mind - but Mrs Palin, who lost to Barack Obama three years ago, says that's inaccurate.

Despite the airing of the film, which
has prompted speculation that she will run again in 2012, she says 
deciding to run for President
is a 'tough decision' and she's not ready to announce her intentions.

A throng of supporters chanted her 
name and urged her to run for President outside the Pella Opera House, 
where roughly 350 people packed the theatre.

Stephen K. Bannon's documentary chronicles Palin's life and her progress through the ranks of government.

It is said to be a flattering portrait of her time on the McCain campaign and her rise as a national heroine to the tea party.

Reports have already been circulating
that the former Alaska governor and her aides were inviting prominent 
Republicans from the state to meet with her after the screening.

But Palin's political action committee already denied the reports as well as Republican operatives in Iowa.

One told ABC news: 'Not only have I 
not heard from Governor Palin regarding meetings, I am unaware of anyone
who has been contacted regarding private meetings.'

It was on a Politico blog with the 
headline 'Sarah Palin team reaching out to Iowa activists for meetings' 
that former Iowa GOP executive director and prominent conservative Chuck
Laudner told Politico that a 'Palin backer' contacted him about 
attending a mingling session after the film.

Several other prominent GOP activists also told Real Clear Politics that they had not been contacted regarding potential sit-downs with Palin while she is visiting the important early nominating state.

The majority of the documentary details Palin's early political career using old news archives and interviews with conservatives and Palin allies such as Thomas Van Flein, now a Capitol Hill staffer.

The movie opens with a photo montage and home videos showing Palin as a young girl and in her early teens.

The million-dollar project is set for national release in July. Palin is said to have already seen a rough cut of the movie.

In a statement released by the movie's distributor, the 47-year-old said she looks 'forward to seeing the finished film for the first time with fellow Americans from the heartland'.

The Undefeated is not the only documentary about the possible presidential candidate.

British filmmaker Nick Broomfield is shopping a documentary that examines Palin's life and rise to prominence through interviews with her parents, friends, and colleagues.

It is thought that the filmmaker has painted a scathing portrait of Palin.

American filmmaker Stephen Bannon has put together a flattering portrait of Palin which is said to present her as a Joan of Arc-like figure.

He relies on interviews with her allies in Alaska and sympathetic conservative commentators in an unapologetic defence of Palin.

It charts her rise from Wasilla mayor to Alaska governor in what is described as a 'zero-warts' version of her rise through the political ranks and borrows heavily from her autobiography Going Rogue.

Palin is portrayed as a national heroine, beset by vicious left-wing enemies seeking to thwart her heroic attempts to revive Reagan's conservative legacy.

It incorporates previously unseen footage from her childhood and early years as an elected official with the end focusing on her as a tea party hero who is 'the type of leader this country needs'.

The Undefeated shows her as a Republican operating outside the party's traditional men's club power structure and questions the manhood of GOP leaders for not defending her after the 2008 election.

It will be premiered in Iowa tonight and open nationwide on July 15.

English filmmaker Nick Broomfield has vowed to unveil the 'real' Sarah Palin in his as-yet-untitled film about her.

It is said to examine her life and rise to prominence through interviews with her parents, friends and colleagues.

In a preview from the clip ex-legislative director John Bitney and ex-Senate president Lyda Green complain about her habit of using her Blackberry during meetings.

Bitney said that it was 'frustrating' to set up a meeting with her saying she was 'just very unengaged in the conversation' and often 'just wasn't listening'.

Green also reiterates this saying: 'I never felt that Sarah was ever connected to the business in the building. She generally had her two Blackberries and was texting most of the time.'Â 

The influential U.S. independent film producer Cassian Elwes last week tweeted: 'Just saw Nick Broomfield's film on Sarah Palin. Wow. Its going to change the presidential race.'

It is due to be screened in Los Angeles next week for potential buyers

Palin has yet to give any definitive indication as to whether or not she intends to enter the 2012 presidential race but appearing in Iowa will undoubtedly excite her supporters.

Michelle Bachmann launched her campaign in the state yesterday and President Obama is also speaking to voters in the first in the nation caucus state.

Last week, in response to rumours that she shut down her One Nation bus tour and ditched plans of a presidential bid, Palin took to Facebook to assert that she plans to get back on the road this summer.

She revealed that her plans had been delayed by her being called for jury duty.

According to her website, after Iowa she is helping her daughter Bristol sign copies of her memoir Not Afriad of Life: My Journey So Far, before going back to Alaska for duty.
