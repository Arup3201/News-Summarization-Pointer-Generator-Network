A fault on the new A380 superjumbo which caused the grounding of every one of the jets has been blamed on British engineering.

Airbus has now traced the cause of small cracks developing on the wings of some of the £250million double-decker A380s to a small component engineered in its design centre in Filton, Bristol, it is understood.

The manufacturer has been forced to order a global reacall fix for the offending aluminium brackets which hold the wing’s skin to the structure. It will affect the entire fleet of 69 planes currently flying.

The Airbus A380 is a superjumbo that took its first flight on April 2005. There are a total of 115 A380s in operation as of November 2013. It is a double decker jet with a wingspan of 79.75 metres

The news is a major blow to British 
industry.

The wings are the only part of the cutting-edge A380e which 
are built in the UK. Airbus employs 9,500 people in its Filton 
design centre and manufacting complex in Broughton, Wales.

The wings are then taken by sea to be assembled in Toulouse from parts built across Europe.

It is feared the issue could cost Airbus more than £80million in compensation.

A senior industry expert told The 
Times: ‘The issue is around the type of aluminum being used and the 
fitting which, as a result of the assembly, creates the crack’, with a 
source close to the problem adding, ‘It is a design and process 
engineering failure’.

The minor cracks - no more than two 
centimetres long - were discovered after Qantas ordered a fleet-wide 
inspection following the explosion of a Rolls-Royce engine during a 
flight, last year.

Airbus has insisted there is no threat
 to safety posed by the flaw and safety agencies on both sides of the 
Atlantic have given the planes the all clear to continue flights.

But Airbus is bringing in the aircraft
 for the fix after about 1,300 flights when the enormous stress of thousands of 
hours of airtime start to exacerbate the problem.

An Airbus spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are not commenting on individual sites and areas.

'Everyone in the company is absolutely focussed on resolving the issue.

'We are all one Airbus and the issue involves many parts of our global organisation.

'The issue is related to the material being used combined with the way parts are assembled on that specific area of the aircraft.'

The A380 made by Airbus, a unit of 
European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.,was hailed as the next 
generation of planes which would save the longhaul flight industry.

It was designed to carry around 800 passengers more efficiently a cheaper than any aircraft ever before.

Industry experts say it is not unusual
 for new planes to develop unforeseen faults in the first few years of 
flight. These are normally quickly identified and ironed out.

The A380 aircraft are in use by Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Air France, Lufthansa, Korean Airlines and China Southern.

The planes have been in service for five years. In total, 238 of the aircraft have been ordered by 17 airlines worldwide.

British Airways is due to take 
delivery of 12 A380s next year, while the first of Virgin’s eight 
superjumbos will arrive in 2015.

Singapore Airlines, one of the 
carriers that operates A380s in and out of Heathrow airport, was the 
first airline to take delivery of a superjumbo, with the debut passenger
 flight taking place in October 2007.

Superjumbo services to Heathrow began in March 2008, with Manchester airport services starting in September 2010.
