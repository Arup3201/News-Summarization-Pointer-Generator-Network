Stepping onto the Martian surface unsuited would cause your lungs to explode.

The lack of pressure would make the rest of your internal organs burst too, as your flesh is eaten away by temperatures of –55°C.

While this is the grim scenario played out in science fiction films, scientists are just as worried about the psychological effects of life on the red planet.

Elizabeth Howell, a University of North Dakota student, heard about volunteers for the project through a fellow student and decided to sign up

To find out how humans would cope, a project organised by the Mars Society has attempted to recreate the daily routine of astronauts here on Earth.

More specifically, four miles from Hanksville, Utah in a high-altitude desert described as the ‘most Mars-like place on the planet’.

For two weeks in January, a group of intrepid space enthusiasts donned space suits and lived in isolation, surviving on rations and showering around once every three days.

Among them was Elizabeth Howell, a University of North Dakota student, who heard about volunteers for the project through a fellow student.

Speaking to MailOnline, she describes the unusual experiment as enlightening and at times overwhelming.

‘When I was in a spacesuit I felt like I was in an outside world,’ said Ms Howell. ‘It makes you think and behave differently.’

In total, the crew was made up of seven members– two scientists, two engineers, a medical doctor, a journalist and a humanoid robot.

During her two week stay, Ms Howell’s home was the Habitat Module, a two storey silo-shaped building with lab areas and living spaces, eight metres in diameter.

‘There wasn’t much personal space,’ she said. ‘There were a couple of disagreements.

The suits worn by the scientists came with their own air-conditioning, radio units, heavy helmets, and boots

Boredom wasn't an issue. The crew were tasked with completing over 20 research projects over the two-week expedition, including mock medical procedures

British student was recently shortlisted for the job of repopulating the human race - on Mars.

Ryan MacDonald, 20, beat more than 200,000 hopefuls to reach the final stages of selection for a one-way mission.

The contest was part of the 'Mars One' project to establish a self-sustaining colony.

It would see four people - two men and two women - take a five year flight into space.

Mr MacDonald is now on the shortlist to join the first programme on Mars - which is 57 million miles away from Earth.

The Mars One project was founded by Dutch entrepreneurs Bas Lansdorp and Arno Wielders, and aims to establish a permanent base on the planet by 2025.

An initial appeal for volunteers last year gathered more than 200,000 responses.

‘Only little things, like noise in the kitchen when you have to work out what to do. We quickly found out that we need to talk about these things at the beginning.’

If an argument did occur, crew members couldn’t just step outside to cool off. Leaving the Habitat Module required a request to Mission Support a day in advance.

Even then, they had to put on an unwieldy spacesuit. The suits worn by the scientists came with their own air-conditioning, radio units, heavy helmets, and boots.

Although not quite like the ones that would be used on a space mission, the suits, more than anything, made crew members feel like they were on an alien planet.

‘You’d be surprised,’ said Ms Howell. ‘I actually felt like I was on another world, like I had to rely on these people.

‘I felt separated from everything else – you had this feeling that you were zeroing in on a priority.'

Contact with the outside world was strictly limited, with a very slow internet connection restricted to allow just a few emails in and out each day.

The Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) is one of two habitats maintained by The Mars Society. Its goals are to serve as a Mars analog environment for field operations, science and research

Most communication was with 'mission control', who asked the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two-week shifts. That included details on their food intake, exercise, and psychological status.

Boredom, however, wasn’t an issue. The crew were tasked with completing around a dozen research projects over the two-week expedition.

‘We spent our time setting up a new radio telescope, doing simulated ‘Marswalks’ in spacesuits, and testing out protocols for medical procedures,’ said Ms Howell.

While the technology to conduct these experiments on Mars is advancing, what scientists really wanted to find out was how human error factor into future designs.

‘Something I underestimated was the physical fitness needed,’ said Ms Howell. ‘We did really long walks in the desert and it does make you tired.’

‘It teaches you a lot about resilience, because when you’re resources are limited it forces you to be more creative.’

Some scientists predict it will be 20 years before humans set foot on the planet, and there are currently hopefuls to be on that flight.

Ms Howell, however, is an exception. ‘I’d only go if it wasn’t a one-way trip,’ she said. ‘I’d miss my friends and family too much.’

Nasa estimates the cost of the initial Mars landing to be £3.67billion, and every subsequent manned mission £2.45billion.

Any crew that survives the journey will have to remain there for at least a year and a half, waiting for Mars and Earth to align properly for the trip back.

During this time, they will supply their own oxygen, power, food, and water.

The experiments being conducted in Utah and a sister station in the Arctic are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a trip.

The shortest possible journey to Mars is 140 million miles, a trip that is thought to take around seven months.

Ms Howell admits that living for two weeks on a desert where there is gravity can’t come close to recreating the environment.

‘But I learned a great deal,’ she said. ‘We need to take gradual steps before we’re ready for a mission to Mars, and this is just one of them.’
