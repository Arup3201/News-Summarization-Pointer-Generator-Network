The Montana newlywed who dropped off a cliff 'face first' indicates his wife pushed him 'with two hands,' according to a new claim by prosecution attorneys.

Cody Johnson died just eight days after he and Jordan Graham, 22, got married. Graham claims she is not guilty and will go on trial for murder on Monday.

ABC news reports that expert witnesses will be called and jury selection will last one to two weeks.

Graham holds to her story and her attorney claims that Johnson fell by accident during a physical altercation. The argument allegedly started because Graham was having second thoughts about the marriage.

Graham's federal public defenders will ask jurors to believe that while Graham thought she married too young, she loved Johnson and was only trying to remove his hand from her arm when he fell off the steep cliff.

Prosecutors say that Graham's lack of cooperation with investigators indicates she may be hiding the truth. Documents collected by federal prosecutors also describe an email from a person named 'Tony' that said Johnson had fallen to his death and called for an end to the search.

Investigators say the message was sent from an account using a computer registered to Graham's father. The prosecution believes that 'Tony' is an identity she faked.

Friends say that Graham cried uncontrollably on the day of the wedding

'One of the police theories is that the new bride "snapped" after her husband figured out she had lied about being in love with him. She was only in love with the idea of being a bride,' a source close to the investigation told the National Enquirer.

The source also revealed that authorities believe Cody told her he wanted a divorce or an annulment and she couldn't face telling her friends her husband already wanted out of the week-old marriage, so she came up with a crazy plan to kill him and make it look like an accident, it is believed.

'Prosecutors have to prove that she intended to kill him that this was not an accident,' legal analyst Ada Pozo told ABC News.

The prosecution argues Ms Johnson cryptically told investigators 'it was a place he wanted to see before he died'.

As time wore on, and investigators began piecing together their case against Graham, her story began to change.

Having first told authorities that her dead husband drove off in a dark car the night he disappeared, Graham admitted July 16 they had an argument at the park the night he died.

'This case is going to come down to whether the jury believes that she really regretted this marriage so much that she just pushed him off the edge literally,' Pozo said.

A friend of the accused murderer told the Enquirer: 'Jordan was a dreamer who was more excited about the idea of marriage than actually being married.

'She loved picking the wedding dress and showing off her ring, but on the day of the actual wedding, she sobbed uncontrollably.'

The defense will try to make Graham's lifestyle seem 'reckless.'

Earlier that day, Graham told a friend she was having second thoughts about getting married and meant to talk to Johnson about it, according to the affidavit. She said if the friend didn't hear from her again that night, 'something happened,.'
