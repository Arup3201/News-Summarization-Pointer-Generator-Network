Michael Bloomberg's daughter has embarrassed him yet again after claiming his record on animal welfare is a 'failure.'

Georgina Bloomberg, who is pregnant by her Argentinian boyfriend Ramiro Quintana, said that her father's 'government doesn't care about animals' in a stinging attack on his time as mayor of New York.

She said that not enough people are adopting animals in the city because the shelters for unwanted pets are unappealing and put off potential owners. Miss Bloomberg also called for a ban on horse-drawn carriages in Central Park - even though her father supports them.

The comments from Miss Bloomberg, 30, a strident animal rights campaigner, are likely to spark more lively debate over the dinner table with her dad.

She has already raised eyebrows by writing a novel about a wealthy family in New York riven with squabbles over money and sibling rivalry.

The equestrian drama is built around a plain-speaking billionaire who 'owns half of New York' and lives in Manhattan.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Miss Bloomberg, who has an older sister, Emma, 34, attacked Animal Care & Control, a nonprofit group which Mr Bloomberg's office commissioned to run New York's animal shelter system.

As part of its contract with the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Animal Care & Control must rescue, care and home abandoned animals.

Miss Bloomberg however said that animal welfare is low on the list of priorities for her father.

She said that Animal Care & Controls shelter are not 'a place where people want to go to adopt animals, which, to me, is a failure.'

Miss Bloomberg also claimed that the organization is failing to raise enough money because few have faith in it - including potential donors.

Turning her fire on the horse drawn carriages in Central Park, Miss Bloomberg added that contrary to her father, she thinks they should be banned.

She said: 'Obviously, for me, my heart is always with the horses and I always want them to be kept in the best condition possible, which I don't believe they are.

'Maybe the time has come for them to go.'

Miss Bloomberg added that she understands that some people depend on the horses for their livelihood, but claimed that 'if it's just about the horses' then they should not be allowed to continue.

Critics are likely to see her comments as biting the hand that feeds her once again.

Mr Bloomberg, 71, has indulged his daughter's passion for equestrian and paid for at least six horses, which she keeps on estates in North Salem, New York, and Wellington, Florida.

The family also have a lavish property portfolio including neighboring waterfront homes in Bermuda for Miss Bloomberg.

The Bloombergs are amongst the richest people in America and Mr Bloomberg has an estimated personal fortune of $18.1 billion earned through his eponymous financial information company.

But their personal lives were thrown into the spotlight two years ago when Miss Bloomberg published her novel 'The A Circuit.'

The book concerns Wall St billionaire Rick Aaronson, his two daughters and their family squabbles.

His eldest daughter Camille went to an Ivy League colleague and wants to move into politics.

His youngest daughter Tommi is an award-winning horse rider who refuses to do what her father tells her.

'She wasn't afraid to say no to her father,' Tommi says in the book. 'Even if half of Wall Street was.'

By coincidence, Miss Bloomberg's sister Emma went to Princeton and now works with her father City Hall in New York. Another parallel is Miss Bloomberg's own interest in horses.

The hobby is how she met her boyfriend Ramiro Quintana, 36, who is also an equestrian.

A spokesman for Mr Bloomberg declined to comment.

Risa Weinstock, Animal Care & Control's executive director, told the Wall St Journal: 'Our efforts to find homes for abandoned pets have more than doubled animal placements while reducing euthanization by two-thirds over the last 10 years.'
