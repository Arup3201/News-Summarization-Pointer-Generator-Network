Just as Halloween wouldn't be complete without pumpkin carving or ghoulish decorations, it wouldn't be the same without Jimmy Kimmel's now traditional prank on kids.

The late-night talk show host tricked unsuspecting youngsters across the country for the fourth year in a row by encouraging their parents to tell them they had eaten all their Halloween candy.

The results, which were caught on camera and shared a four-minute video, show kids kicking and screaming - and even swearing - at their chuckling parents.

'You've ruined my life!' one yells, while another howls: 'I'm not talking to you for the rest of my life!'

Pained: Two boys can do nothing but scream and cry when their parents claim they've eaten all their snacks - unaware that they are only joking. The video is part of Jimmy Kimmel's annual prank on kids

Enraged: One little girl howls and then begins kicking her legs after learning there's no candy left

Anger: Two brothers break down in sobs - and continue to be mad even when their mother says it's a joke

One girl throws a monstrous fit - pushing over chairs, throwing plates and screaming - while another little boy refuses to believe his mother and turfs through kitchen drawers in search of his snacks.

'Get out,' he scowls at her. 

Others are simply in disbelief at how their parents could eat so much, with one asking: 'All of it? Every single bite? You must have a bellyache.'

But some of the children are understanding of their parents' sweet teeth, and gently reassure them that it's OK.

In a show of kindness, one little boy lifts his hand to his mother as he insists 'it's fine, it's fine' - before giving her a hug.

Make it stop! One youngster can only shake his head and moan as his dad helps himself to his candy

Warning: A boy sobs, left, while another checks all the kitchen drawers and then tells his mom: 'Get out'

Fit: One girl  throws a chair to the ground and then picks up a plate from a table and throws it on the floor

Oops: One girl doesn't miss a beat after her dad says her candy is gone - and bombards him with expletives

Jimmy Kimmel first encouraged parents to trick their kids with the prank in 2011 and has been doing the same every year since.

'We did it again this year and got more videos than ever before,' the show explained on its YouTube page. 'We sifted through more than a thousand and whittled it down to our favorites.'

At the end of the clip, Kimmel explained that if parents and their kids really did get too much candy, they could send it to the troops via Operation Gratitude by November 15.

'Thanks to all the parents who participated - and apologies to the kids who participated as well,' he said, laughing.

In past years, some people have failed to find the prank funny.

Up to his usual tricks: Jimmy Kimmel has pranked kids across the country for the fourth year in a row by encouraging their parents to tell them they had eaten all their Halloween candy

'Pranking your own children is not harmless fun, but is cruel and potentially damaging,' Mark Barnett, a professor at Kansas State University's department of psychological sciences, said last year.

He questioned whether parents were looking out for the best interests of the child.

But this year's viewers were tickled by the video.

'This has to be the funniest series on the internet! Its a pity its only once a year! [sic]' one wrote.

Another warned: 'One day, those kids will hunt you down Jimmy.'
