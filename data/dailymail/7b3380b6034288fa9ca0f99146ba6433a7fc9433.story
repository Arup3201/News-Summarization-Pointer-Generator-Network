The 37-year-old woman charged with being drunk when she ran over and killed her father as he pleaded with her not to leave has a prior DUI conviction, MailOnline can reveal.

Soukvilay 'Lucky' Barton struck and killed family patriarch Bounmy Rajsombath, 69, with her 2003 BMW Z4 convertible as she tried to leave her parents' Riverside home, police said.

A review of California court records showed she has a history of moving violations including failure to obey stop signs and speeding - but it is a drunk driving conviction that stands out from the list.

The twice-married woman has a handful of court dockets to her name, but the 2006 DUI conviction came after her blood alcohol level was found by police to be above the .08 legal limit, and appears to be a plea deal based on the number of other charges dropped on the same docket.

She faces charges of gross vehicle manslaughter and drunk driving in the death of her father, which came only two days before Father's Day.

is said by witnesses to have ignored her father's pleas to stay while he stood behind the car, and instead ran over him as she backed out of the driveway.

She then stopped the car after realizing her father was injured and sat crying until being taken into custody by police.

Images from the scene showed the car about halfway out of the driveway and Barton being led away from the scene in handcuffs while her husband Tad Barton trailed a number of steps behind.

Family members told investigators that 
Lucky Barton argued with several of them after drinking that evening, 
the Press-Enterprise reported.

Father Bounmy Rajsombath was rushed to a Riverside hospital, where he was pronounced dead Friday night.

A man identifying himself as Rajsombath's son-in-law said that his father-in-law ran a refugee camp in Thailand where people fleeing the communist insurgency in Laos during the Vietnam War.

Prior to coming to the U.S., Rajsombath
 spent years as a high-ranking member of the Laos defense department 
helping the U.S. during the Vietnam War, according to the paper.

'He had to swim across the Mekong River to get to Thailand because the 
communists had come to kill him,' said the man, who spoke in front of 
the home with a large American flag above the garage, pe.com reports. 'They were killing
 all the Laos military that helped the United States.'

The son-in-law, who asked to not be 
identified, says Rajsombath came to the U.S. in 1979 with his wife. The 
couple settled in southern California and had two sons and two 
daughters.

The man said Rajsombath worked as a plumber until he injured his arm in a fall about 10 years ago.

The son-in-law says that even after his injury, the tragically dead man would often do plumbing work  free of charge for people who couldn't afford it. 

'He was a person that everybody loved,' he said. 'He was a very respected man in the Laos community.'

The man declined to speak about what caused Rajsombath's death, saying only that 'I'm very sad. I'm sick.'

Barton was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence and held on $75,000 bond. She remains in Riverside County Detention Center pending an arraignment.
