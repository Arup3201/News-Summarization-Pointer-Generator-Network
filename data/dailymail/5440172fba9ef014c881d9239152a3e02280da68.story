Having lost both her parents to Alzheimer’s disease, Fiona Phillips has witnessed the agonising frustration they endured of being unable to communicate their simplest wishes.

It is a fate she knows there is a risk she could also suffer if the illness takes hold and the television presenter has revealed that she has now decided to write a letter to her husband and sons, telling them exactly how she wants to be cared for should she be unable to verbalise it.

Yesterday, Miss Phillips, 53, spoke for the first time about the preparations she is already putting in place should she also develop Alzheimer’s disease.

It has meant deciding which care home she would like to be looked after in, despite being currently in good health.

Miss Phillips, who is married to journalist Martin Frizell and has two sons Nathaniel, 15, and Mackenzie, 12 made her comments as she opened an Alzheimer’s Society garden at the Chelsea Flower Show yesterday.

Miss Phillips said: ‘Of course, [I think about it], of course, my husband says “but you’ve always been scatty, you’ve always lost things, you’ve always forgotten things”.

‘But now I just think “oh God, maybe that means it’s going to become an illness”. I hope not. I just keep meaning to write a letter to my husband and boys, being in a family of boys, and I only had brothers, I just fear for where are they gonna dump me?

‘So I keep meaning to write this letter to them saying “please, put me here, don’t put me there, and here’s the money for it”.’

To some it may seem like a rather drastic measure for Miss Phillips to be taking this early in her life, however both her mother, Amy, and father, Phil, were young when they developed the disease.

Her father was 76 when he died in 2012 and her mother was 74 when she passed away in 2006. Common signs of Alzheimer’s, which affects one in three people in the UK, include forgetfulness - something Miss Phillips said she has always had - and confusion about time or place.

And the presenter, who is best known for her GMTV days and now regularly appears on BBC consumer programme Watchdog, sadly recalled the experience of her father when he spent the night in a police cell because he couldn’t remember his address.

Miss Phillips said: ‘We didn’t even know he had dementia and apparently he was driving erratically. So the police stopped him, breathalysed him, and he hadn’t been drinking. But they took him anyway and locked him up for the night. I think it’s because he couldn’t tell them where he lived or anything.’

It wasn’t until days later when he began ‘babbling about the police’ that Miss Phillips and her brothers were able to get to the bottom of what had happened. Even then it proved difficult, with confidentiality rules getting in the way.

But perhaps the hardest thing for families of dementia sufferers is watching as their frustrations at being unable to remember things can lead to anger and sometimes aggression.

And Miss Phillips said it makes her upset to hear of vulnerable people being ‘hand cuffed and slung in a cell’ because police officers don’t know how to deal with them.

She said: ‘I’ve had letters from people saying their loved one has misbehaved in a home, the home has called the doctor, the doctor’s said call the police and the police come. It’s sad.’

Miss Phillips was joined in opening the garden, which marks a partnership between the Alzheimer’s Society and homes and gardens retailer Homebase, by Sir Michael Parkinson, 79, whose mother Frieda developed Alzheimer’s in the years before her death aged 97.

Devastatingly, Frieda suffered such memory loss that she no longer recognised the veteran broadcaster as her son.

Appearing at the flower show with his wife, Mary, with whom he has three children, Sir Michael said: ‘[My mother] didn’t believe I was her son, she thought I was her brother, Tom.

She also brought my father back from the dead after several years. And she had a girl who came to visit her who she could see and talk to her but I couldn’t. In the end, the trouble with Alzheimer’s is you lose the parent before they die. That’s the problem. You have to live with, not a corpse, but a stranger.’

The Homebase Garden - ‘Time to Reflect’ in association with Alzheimer’s Society was created by award-winning garden designer Adam Frost and a team of young gardeners.

It will remain at the Royal Horticultural Society’s Chelsea Flower Show until the programme ends on Saturday.
