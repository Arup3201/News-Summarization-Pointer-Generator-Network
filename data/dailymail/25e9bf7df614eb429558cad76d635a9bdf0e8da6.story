The families of two holidaymakers mown down by a truck in Thailand today said the deaths have left a 'massive hole' in their lives, as the first pictures of the pair were released.

Derek Gent and Mike Holmes, both 68 and from Rochdale, Greater Manchester died in the road traffic accident while away with their wives on the lush tropical island of Koh Samui.

They had been friends for 30 years, their children said in a joint statement today.

The pair are thought to have been walking by the side of a road when an out-of-control pick-up truck collided with another vehicle, careered off the road and slammed into them.

The men had been staying with their wives at the luxurious Rocky's Boutique Resort in Koh Samui. Their wives were not with them at the time of the incident.

Their children today paid tribute them in a joint statement.

'We are really struggling to comprehend our loss. It has shocked us all and left a massive hole in our lives. Derek and Mike were regular golfing partners and friends for more than 30 years,' they said.

'Devoted husbands, fathers and grandfathers, their loss will be felt by our families and their many friends.

'Our mothers Janet Holmes and Christine Gent have been overwhelmed by the kindness and support they have received from the employees of the resort where they were staying (Rocky's Boutique Resort), the Thai people and the holiday company they travelled with (Kuoni).'

Reports from the holiday island say the truck originally collided with a Toyota Corolla and veered off the road.

It then hit Mr Gent - former head of Oldham's trading standards until he retired around 10 years ago - and Mr Holmes, before smashing into a tea shop.

The driver of the Toyota told police he was driving home from the beach when the truck tried to overtake him causing a collision which span the pick-up 'out of control'.

The truck driver is critically ill in a Bangkok hospital, while the driver of the Toyota escaped unharmed.

Height of luxury: Rocky's Resort in Koh Samui, where the two men were staying with their wives

'Kindness and support': It is believed their widows were returning home 
yesterday from the luxury resort, where rooms cost from £150 to £420 a 
night at this time of year

Mr Gent and father-of-three Mr Holmes, who worked in sales, had been staying with their wives at the hotel which is close to the scene of the tragedy.

It is believed their widows were returning home yesterday from the luxury resort, where rooms cost from £150 to £420 a night at this time of year.

Neighbours on Croft Head Drive, Milnrow, where keen angler Mr Gent lived, were visibly upset at the news of the deaths.

'They were both absolutely wonderful men. Everyone is still in shock,' said one.

Another said: 'We'll miss them very much. They were both lovely people.'

A third neighbour added: 'I have lost two fantastic friends.'

Long-standing Oldham councillor Hugh 
McDonald, who had previously worked with Mr Gent, said: 'Derek was 
always very courteous and pleasant and dealt with things very well. It 
is an awful tragedy.'

John 
Battye, a fellow Oldham councillor, added: 'Derek was very professional 
and transformed our service from mediocre to first class.

'He was a very tall, handsome fellow and had quite a presence.'

Mr and Mrs Holmes lived just a few yards away from the Gents on Yeoman's Close.

One neighbour said: 'Our thoughts are with both families. It is just absolutely tragic.'

Another added: 'Michael will be missed. Our deepest sympathies go to both families.'

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth office confirmed it had been informed of their deaths and added: 'We are aware of the death of two British nationals in Thailand on March 23.

'We are providing full consular assistance to the families at this time.'
