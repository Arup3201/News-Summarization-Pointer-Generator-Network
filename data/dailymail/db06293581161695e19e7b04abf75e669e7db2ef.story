Kennewick Man was definitely not a Native American, according to the most recent study of the prehistoric remains.

The 9,300-year-old skeleton actually has more in common with Polynesians, according to Doug Owsley, an anthropologist with the Smithsonian Institute who released an updated review of the bones Wednesday.

Owsley found that Kennewick man's skull has several similarities to the ancient coastal people in Asia, meaning he likely shares a common ancestor with modern day Polynesians.

Unearthing the truth: Dr. Doug Owsley found no evidence the Kennewick Man was a Native American

Since his discovery in 1996, Kennewick Man has been presumed to be a Native American who lived in the region he was uncovered.

The corpse is one of the complete ancient skeletons ever discovered.

Kennewick Man was found accidentally by two spectators watching a hydroplane race  in 1996, on the bank of the Columbia River in Kennewick Washington.

Scientists were given 10 days to study the bones in 2005.

 Karabu - Found in South Africa this is the most complete pre-human skeleton discovered dating back 2 million years.

The 'Vampire' Skeletons - These 800-yeard old skeletons were found in Bulgaria with rods piercing their chests, a ritual aimed at preventing dangerous people from returning as vampires.

King Richard III - Scientists say bones discovered this year under an English parking lot could belong to the monarch, buried in 1485. The skull is split by what appears to be a battle wound.

Lucy - Thought to be 3.2 million years old Lucy is thought to be the remains of an early human anscestor, though the specimen is only 40 percent complete

Based on their findings and Owsley's latest research, Kennewick man was likely 39 or 40 years old, stood roughly 5-foot-8 and weighed approximately 160 pounds.

He was so strong that the bone in his right arm was curved, and he was probably a practiced spear thrower. An injury in his right soldier, a piece of bone floating in the joint, is often seen in people who throw javelins,

Scientists are still unsure how he died, with his skeleton in excellent condition besides one abscessed tooth.

His skull showed evidence of having been fractured but had healed perfectly while his ribs had also been broken but healed less well.

He probably had to constantly move to find food meaning his ribs could not rest to heal properly.

Researchers believe he was buried where his bones were discovered, laid to rest face up with his chin tucked down and his hands at his sides with palms down.

Owsley's report challenges years of assumptions besides Kennewick Man's presumed ties to Native Americans.

An isotopic analysis of the bones 
shows he was most likely eating a coastal diet of marine protein - most 
likely seals - rather than the grazing animals that would have 
surrounded him had he lived in Columbia Valley.

'They are not what you would expect 
from someone from Columbia Valley,' Owsley said. 'You would have to eat 
salmon 24 hours a day and you would not reach these values.'

Owsley presented his findings Tuesday at a meeting with Columbia Plateau tribal leaders.

Owsley has been at the center of a decade-long legal battle with those same tribes to study Kennewick Man's body.

Tribal leaders who claim the bones are of Native American ancestry want to bury them according to Native American tradition.

In 2004, a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled the remains were not protected by the federal Native American 
Graves Protection Act because they were too old to credibly establish a 
link with modern Native Americans.

The Burke Museum at the University of Washington has held the remains since 1998.

Despite Owsley's findings, tribal leaders still believe Kennewick Man was a Native American.

New research indicates Kennewick Man wasn't a Native American and was likely from a coast

Rex Buck, leader of the Wanapum people, thought a diet of lamprey eel could provide the same nutrients Owsley found.

'I hope you would think about
some of these things, too, and add that to your equation,' he told Owsley.

But even without the dietary evidence, Owsley said he was certain Kennewick Man was not a Native American.

'There is not any clear genetic relationship to Native American peoples,' he said. 'I do not look at him as a Native American....I can't see any kind of continuity. He is a representative of a very different people.'
