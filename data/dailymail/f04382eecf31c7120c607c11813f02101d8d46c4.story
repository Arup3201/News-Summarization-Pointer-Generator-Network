Stores are giving as little as 6.7 per cent of the price of charity Christmas cards to good causes.

A Which? Money survey of 15 chains found Asda was the least generous retailer, while rivals Sainsbury’s and Waitrose both gave ten per cent of the profits made to charity.

Their small donation compares meagerly to buying Christmas cards from charities directly, with most ensuring all funds go to the organisation.

A market research survey has found supermarkets have been giving as little as six per cent of Christmas charity card profits to good causes

Asda sold packs of charity cards for £3, of which just 20p was donated to charity – working out at only 6.7 per cent of the selling price, the survey found.

Marie Curie Cancer Care however sold cards at £3.99 a pack, with only £1 of the retail price going towards the cost of production.

Oxfam said that for every Christmas card sold, 44p of every £1 went directly back into the charity.

Researchers polled a number of online and in store retailers in the survey.

A Which? spokeswoman said: 'Consumers may want to check how much will be donated if they’re buying charity Christmas cards because our research shows this can vary widely.'

WH Smith did sell one pack of cards that had 100 per cent of the selling price going to charity and another set that had a 20 per cent donation.

Debenhams sold one pack of cards where 100 per cent of the profits from the cards went to charity, but excluded VAT.

It also excluded VAT from the 20 per cent of the selling price it donated on its other charity cards.

Waitrose sold a set of cards that donated 100 per cent including VAT, while Boots gave 10 per cent on its 'standard' charity cards and 20 per cent on its Children in Need cards, including VAT.

The most generous retailer across its full range of Christmas cards, by size of donation, was John Lewis. It gave 25 per cent of the selling price on all its own-brand cards.
