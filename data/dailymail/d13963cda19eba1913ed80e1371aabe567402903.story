Abducted: Moira Anderson went missing in 1957 and is thought to have been murdered by rapist Alexander Gartshore

Police searching for the body of an 11-year-old girl who vanished while running an errand in 1957 began exhuming a grave yesterday.

Moira Anderson is believed to have been abducted and murdered after catching a bus, but no trace of her has ever been found.

Yesterday, almost 56 years after  the Scottish schoolgirl was last  seen, forensic experts began excavating a grave to see if her remains were hidden there.

Convicted paedophile Alexander Gartshore, who was a bus driver in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, when Moira went missing, was later accused of the murder by his own daughter.

Gartshore, who died in 2006, is suspected of burying Moira’s body in a plot intended for a recently deceased acquaintance, Sinclair Upton. It later emerged he told a colleague that Mr Upton had done him a ‘big favour’. The exhumation was ordered after Moira’s sister, Janet Hart, who lives in Australia, launched a petition for Mr Upton’s grave to be opened in the hope of finding her remains.

Forensic experts have warned they faced a sensitive and painstaking task, however, with a total of eight people known to have been buried in the plot dating back to 1908. A radar survey already carried out suggests there may be an extra body there.

On the scene: Sandra Brown, daughter of suspect Alexander Gartshore, at the cemetery where she believes he buried Moira's body

Investigation: Police have begun exhuming a grave at Old Monkland Cemetery in Coatbridge, Scotland, in the search for a schoolgirl who went missing almost 56 years ago

Hope: The exhumation, which began at the request of Moira's sisters Janet Hart and Marjory Muir, is expected to last several days

Mystery: Police are hoping to find the remains of Moira Anderson who disappeared while running an errand for her grandmother in 1957

Moira was last seen catching a bus on
her way to the local Co-op on an errand for her grandmother in February
1957. Gartshore – a convicted child rapist – has been blamed for 
Moira’s murder by his daughter,  Sandra Brown, in her book Where There 
Is Evil. Shortly before his death in 2006, he told her Moira had haunted
him all his life.

Mrs Brown, 63, set up the Moira 
Anderson Foundation which campaigned for the murder case to be reopened,
a plea granted last year by the Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland. At the 
time, Mrs Brown said: ‘I truly believe this grave has secrets to give 
up. We owe it to Moira to open it.’

Police have warned that the heavily 
waterlogged grave at Old Monkland Cemetery in Coatbridge has as many as 
three layers, and that establishing whether it contains Moira’s remains 
is likely to be a slow process.

Sensitive: Chief Inspector Kenny McLeod said officers would be as respectful as possible to the graves

Excavation: Officers begin exhuming the grave which is believed to belong to an acquittance of suspect Alexander Gartshore

They are exploring the possibility 
that Moira’s body may have been dumped under a coffin in the grave, 
which was thought to have been open around the time of her 
disappearance.

Yesterday a large section of the 
cemetery was cordoned off with police tape, with a large black tent and a
series of smaller blue tents erected around the excavation site.

The exhumation is being led by Professor Sue Black and a team from the forensic anthropology department at Dundee University.

Chief Inspector Kenny McLeod, of 
Strathclyde Police, said: ‘There may be no necessity to exhume all eight
human remains but that does remain a possibility. Operations like this 
are not taken lightly as we remain sensitive to Moira Anderson’s family 
and also the families who have relatives buried elsewhere in the 
cemetery.’

Historic: The disappearance of Moira Anderson has been one of the longest investigations in the history of Scottish police
