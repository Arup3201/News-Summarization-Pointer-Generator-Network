Stung: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha stop for a drink by a beach during their holiday on the Spanish island of Lanzarote

One local said Mr Cameron – who is a keen swimmer and patron of the Chipping Norton lido outdoor pool in his Oxfordshire constituency – got his children out of the sea after someone shouted a warning but then went back in the water himself.

Ex-pat Wendy Lambert, 59, said one of her friends had pointed out to Mr Cameron that 'there's loads of jellies down there'.

Miss Lambert added: 'Everyone got out of the water and his kids walked back with their minders around the pier.

'But then he decided to get back in, then suddenly he came out shouting in pain after getting stung.'

It was not clear what type of jellyfish stung the Prime Minister. Miss Lambert, who has lived at the Canary Island resort for 12 years, described the type of jellyfish usually seen nearby as 'a reddy colour, quite small but with very long tentacles'.

Sources close to Mr Cameron confirmed he had been stung but stressed that he had not required treatment.

Mr Cameron, 47, has been staying with his wife Samantha, 42, and their three children at a £200-a-night yoga retreat at the resort. They are due back in the UK this weekend.
