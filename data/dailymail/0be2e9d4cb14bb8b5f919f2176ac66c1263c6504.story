Usain Bolt's father insists his son is enjoying the Commonwealth Games in Scotland and will 'electrify' the crowd when he competes in the 4x100m relay on Friday.

The Jamaican sprinter, renowned as the world's fastest man, was criticised after reports in The Times claimed he had desribed the games as 'a bit sh**t. The six-time Olympic champion denies making the comment and reacted on Twitter by saying 'I'm waking up to this nonsense..journalist please don't create lies to make headlines.'

Bolt's feelings have been reiterated by his father Wellesley who told ITV Sport: 'I speak to him yesterday and he said he was enjoying the weather'.

Bolt Snr admitted that he had found the Glasgow climate 'a little cold' himself but had otherwise been enjoying the XX Commonwealth Games.

While the 100m and 200m world record holder chose not to compete in the individual sprint races, he will appear as part of Jamaica's 4x100m relay - with his father predicting a typically explosive race from his son.

'He can't wait to go on the track. I know he's going to electrify the crowd.'

'He'll be running the anchor leg. He will be running the heats and the final. We'll all be there.'

Even without his son running, Bolt Snr was confident that Jamaica will dominate the sprint and relay events by winning 'All three medals. 100, 4x1, ladies one, 4x4.'

Asked if Bolt got his prodigious running skills from his mother, his father said: 'Both of us. I used to run in school. Both of us…genetic genes.'
