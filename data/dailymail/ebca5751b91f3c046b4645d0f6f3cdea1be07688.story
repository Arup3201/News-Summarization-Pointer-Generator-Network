A rock found in Russia's Koryak Mountains might be older than anything on Earth's surface, say researchers at Princeton.

Researchers believe it may have formed in the early solar system - before the Earth.

It contains a baffling crystal of a sort that researchers previously believed never occurred in nature - and could only be made by man.

The rock, found in Russia's Koryak mountains, is a mysterious 'quasicrystal' - a kind of crystal discovered in synthetic materials in 1982. Until now, it was believed quasicrystals did not occur in nature - and all were man made

The rock, found in Russia's Koryak mountains, is a mysterious 'quasicrystal' - a kind of crystal discovered in synthetic materials in 1982.

Until now, it was believed quasicrystals did not occur in nature - and all were man made.

The mysterious rock fragment in Russia is only known natural quasicrystal on our planet.

The fragile crystalised fragment - known as a quasicrystal -
is believed to be the remains of a meteorite that formed during the formation of the early solar system.

If correct, it is it older than any rock found so far on Earth's surface.

Researcher Paul Steinhardt of Princeton University said: 'Analysis of the oxygen isotope in the rock indicate it is a
fragment of a meteorite formed at the formation of the solar system over 4.5
billion years ago.'

Experts believe that the tiny rock may have come crashing down as part of a possible meteorite
shower, before being found in Russia’s Koryak Mountains.

‘Its chemical composition of metallic copper and aluminium
resemble those  primitive
meteorites that scientists think were remnants shed from the original building
blocks of planets,' says Steinhardt.

'It means this rock may be the remnant of a meteorite that
originated in the early solar system before Earth even existed.'

The rock is now being safely housed in the mineral collection
of the Museo di Storia Naturale in Florence, Italy.
