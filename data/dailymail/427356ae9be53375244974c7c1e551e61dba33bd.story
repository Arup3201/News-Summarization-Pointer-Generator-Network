The quality of the finishing we have seen before. From Luis Suarez it has become what we expect.

But what was utterly remarkable about his performance here in Sao Paulo was the fact that he was even on the pitch when he scored what proved a quite brilliant winner for Uruguay.

In the end he left the field with cramp, and understandably so only 28 days after undergoing surgery on an injured knee. But not before accelerating away from a static, stuttering England defence in the 85th minute of this World Cup encounter – 85 minutes for heaven’s sake – and pushing Roy Hodgson’s side perilously close to elimination from the competition.

This, of course, was a night when 
England wished for something similar from Wayne Rooney, and when he 
levelled the score to cancel out Suarez’s first-half strike it seemed he
 had at last made an impact. In his 10th game at his third World Cup, 
the player who promised so much when he first burst onto the 
international stage at Euro 2004 had scored a World Cup goal.

A heavy burden of expectation

There
 was a reason why Steven Gerrard extended an arm across Rooney’s 
shoulders in the tunnel moments before kick-off and whispered into his 
ear.

England’s captain knew how important an encounter this was for his 
international colleague. Just as he knew it was time for England’s 
talismanic striker to finally put that considerable talent to use on the
 greatest stage of all.

Uruguay
 were looking to Suarez to provide much the same inspiration after their
 opening defeat to Costa Rica, so the burden of expectation was heavy on
 both these players on a night when defeat would leave their respective 
teams in a most precarious position.

Central roles

Rooney
 was selected, as expected, in that number 10 role he prefers. If he was
 a peripheral figure on the left flank against Italy, here was an 
opportunity to stamp his authority on the tournament.

In
 fairness to Rooney, he was far from England’s worst player and only 
Gerrard covered more ground than the Manchester United forward. In total
 Rooney ran 10.36km. He also went close on two other occasions and 
created an excellent chance for Daniel Sturridge. But you have to wonder
 if switching Rooney with Raheem Sterling was the right move when the 
youngster was so impressive against Italy. Here, on the 
right, he created not once chance before being hooked by Hodgson. And 
England lacked the drive and ambition they had with Sterling in the 
central role.

In truth 
Rooney might have devoted too much energy running into areas away from 
the zone where he needed to be most effective; between Sturridge and the
 midfield. Compare that to Suarez. He planted himself between England’s 
centre-halves and punished them. Quite simply, the man did his job.

Quality of the opposition

If
 Rooney took encouragement from Uruguay’s defensive display against 
Costa Rica, the changes Oscar Tabarez was forced to make because of 
injury and suspension perhaps would have given him further cause for 
optimism.

There was Alvaro Pereira at left back; once of Porto and Inter
 Milan but now at Sao Paulo. But more significantly there was Jose 
Gimenez, a 19-year-old centre-half with only one league appearance for 
Atletico Madrid after signing for a million Euros last year. He was 
certainly nowhere to be seen when Rooney arrived, unopposed, to meet 
Glen Johnson’s ball for England’s equaliser.

But
 Suarez must have fancied his chances as well against defenders he knows
 only too well. They also looked fragile in their opening game here in 
Brazil and he embarrassed Phil Jagielka much as Mario Balotelli did Gary
 Cahill.

As Danny Mills observed, ‘if the centre-forward can 
see the number on your back you are in trouble’.  A brief add to that: 
If a centre-forward is allowed to seize on a long ball and score 
unchallenged, the entire defence has failed in its principal  task. 
Never mind the quality of the finish. That was shocking defending from 
England.

Fitness concern: But Suarez was full of running on his return from injury, troubling the England defence

Inches: Wayne Rooney went close to opening the scoring with a curling free-kick early on

Not quite: The Manchester United striker thought his World Cup goal would never come

Was fitness an issue?

Suarez
 might have declared himself 100 per cent fit but, seriously, who was he
 kidding? Nobody returns at their best in the first game that kind of 
absence. What we saw though, in both the header he scored and the finish
 he produced, was the natural skill, agility and athleticism he 
possesses. Not to mention that killer instinct. It’s why he so 
outrageously outstanding.   

If
 there were fitness concerns about Rooney prior to the tournament, and 
one still wonders how disciplined he was in getting himself ready for 
the World Cup given his weakness for some of the finer things in life, 
he answered his critics here.

Opportunities squandered

Suarez wasted one particularly good chance in the 51st minute when he had a clear shot on Joe Hart’s goal.

But
 let’s just look at the statistics for a moment here. Suarez has now 
scored 40 international goals in 78 appearances, 11 of those coming in 
qualifying for this World Cup. And the two he scored here came on a 
night when he was also taking Uruguay’s free-kicks and corners.

For
 Rooney, he will reflect on this game with more frustration. He went 
mighty close to scoring twice in the first half, first with a free-kick 
that whistled just wide and then when meeting a Gerrard free-kick with a
 header that crashed against the crossbar.

In the second half he also 
forced Fernando Muslera to make a stunning close-range save. But that’s 
still one goal from four chances, compared to a return of two from three
 for Suarez. Says it all really, even if Rooney also delivered one super
 ball for Sturridge shortly after Suarez had scored.

It was a 
defence-splitting ball that sent Sturridge into space, the England 
forward forcing Muslera to make a decent save at his near post.

Wrong foot: Rooney shot straight at the goalkeeper when he found space in the penalty area

Sitter: Wayne Rooney missed a great chance from yards out after a fine cross from a free-kick

Agonising: The England striker had never scored a goal in a World Cup, despite playing in three tournaments

How did they carry themselves?

Suarez
 might not have been fit but boy was he fired up. After sitting through 
that dreadful performance in Fortaleza, he demanded higher standards 
from his colleagues. Martin Caceres certainly got an earful when he 
delayed delivery of a pass.   

Rooney used to be like that too, but he seems less influential, less vocal, on the pitch these days.

Verdict

It
 is in World Cups that world class players shine, and if Rooney could 
once claim to stand among the best those days appear to over. Suarez 
proved that, essentially on one leg.
