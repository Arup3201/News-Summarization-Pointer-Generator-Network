Wanted; Police have issued this e-fit of the blonde teenage girl who stole the milk float

This is the blonde teenager wanted by police for allegedly stealing a milk float and then crashing it into parked cars during an early morning joyride.

The offender and her accomplice, both believed to be aged around 16 to 18-years-old, took the slow-moving delivering vehicle from St Vincent's Road in Dartford, Kent at 6.10am.

Witnesses said they drove it down the road before losing control and smashing into parked cars leaving them severely damaged.

The pair then fled the scene.

The blonde girl is described as around 5'3" wearing a black leather jacket and jeans.

The boy was slim, white, with short, fair hair, wearing beige shorts and trainers and carrying a bag with a long strap.

The incident happened on July 17.

Police have now issued this e-fit and asked anyone who recognises it to come forward.

Investigating officer, detective constable Gerry King, said: 'What probably seemed like a prank to them has caused a great deal of annoyance and stress to others.

'We will not tolerate people behaving like this in our streets.

'We have compiled an e-fit of a female we believe could help us with our enquiries and ask anybody who recognises her, or who has information about the incident, to come forward.'
