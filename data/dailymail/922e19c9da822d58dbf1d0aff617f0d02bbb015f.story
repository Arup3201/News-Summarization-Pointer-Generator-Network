Determined: Omar Gonzalez, 42, managed to get past five rings of security to reach the White House

The homeless Iraq veteran who jumped over the White House fence  last week got past five rings of security as he stormed the executive mansion, it has emerged.

Omar Gonzalez, 42, was eventually subdued by the sixth ring - a plainclothes guard - after the other measures failed, including a slow-moving SWAT team and an attack dog that wasn't released.

Gonzalez, who served three tours in Iraq, was carrying a small knife and did not express any wish to harm the president, instead claiming he just wanted to tell him that the 'atmosphere was collapsing'. Still, his successful attempt on the White House raises serious security questions.

A day after Gonzalez's first court appearance on charges of unlawfully entering restricted grounds while carrying a weapon, details have emerged revealing the repeated failings of the security measures.

As he left the public sidewalk and headed towards the White House, he could have been stopped on five different occasions, according to a report in the Washington Post.

First, a plainclothes surveillance team was supposed to spot anyone jumping over the seven foot fence and warn teams inside. But on Friday, the team did not notice Gonzalez as he climbed over.

Next there was a Secret Service officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn. The guard on duty spotted Gonzalez but could not catch him.

Thirdly, an attack dog, a Belgian Malinois, was supposed to stop him, but the animal was never released. In a video of the incident, a dog can be seen running towards him too late.

Next, he was supposed to be stopped by a heavily-armed SWAT team that moves around the grounds, but they failed to react in time, the Washington Post reported.

Finally, a guard was meant to be at the door to the White House, but there was no one there, allowing Gonzalez to run through the door and gain entry to the mansion.

At that point, he was stopped by another agent on patrol inside.

President Obama and his family were not in the building when the incident occurred.

Gonzalez's successful storm on the White House after simply hopping over the fence has raised serious questions about how well the Secret Service is prepared for an attack.

High-ranking officials told the Post it is lucky Gonzalez did not have an explosive device on him, while other Secret Service agents said they were surprised he had not been shot at, as per protocol.

When he stormed the White House on Friday, he eluded these five rings of security, according to the Washington Post:

1. A plainclothes surveillance team outside the gates spotting people jumping over the fence

2. A Secret Service officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn

3. A Belgian Malinois, an attack dog

4.  A heavily-armed SWAT team

5. A guard on the door of the White House

He was eventually stopped by an agent inside the White House.

The agency is now conducting an internal review of the incident and a second fence has been erected along part of the White House grounds.

The waist-high barricade, which closes off part of the sidewalk on Pennsylvania Avenue, went up late Monday or early Tuesday and stands about eight feet away from the regular spike-topped fence.

'This temporary closure is in effect while the Secret Service conducts a comprehensive review of the fence jumping incident,' agency spokesman Brian Leary said in an emailed statement.

The House of Representatives oversight committee has also scheduled a September 30 hearing on the security breach.

After Gonzalez successfully entered the White House, he was detained and authorities carried out a search of his car, finding 800 rounds of ammunition, a machete and two hatchets inside.

Relatives have insisted that Gonzalez, from Copperas Cove, Texas, suffers from post traumatic stress disorder after serving three tours in Iraq. He retired after losing part of his foot in an IED blast. 

Samantha Bell, Gonzalez's ex-wife, said she split up with him in 2010 because of his worsening mental condition. She added that after his second tour in Iraq, he began carrying a .45 on his hip at all times and would keep three or four guns in their home.

'Omar is a good guy, he's just got some issues that he needs help with,' she said in an interview. 'I think this is a cry out for help, what he's done. He really does need help. I just hope he can get it.' 

His former stepson, Jerry Murphy, added to NewsWest9: 'He's got a fun loving personality about him. He's an all around good guy.'

He said he thinks PTSD is to blame for last week's outburst.  

'I think after he probably had to put a kid or two down running at you with a grenade or a machine gun it would take a toll on any human being that has a heart,' he said.

'Obviously in his mind he was on some sort of a mission to warn people about something... He's never forsaken or turned his back on his country. He gave his mind and his family for this country.' 

According to criminal complaints obtained by ABC News, D.C. authorities already knew of Gonzalez after he had been stopped on two occasions with apparent intentions to target the White House. On both occasions, he was interviewed by the Secret Service, but they found no cause to arrest him.

In July, Virginia authorities found 'several assault rifles' in a vehicle when he was arrested after speeding and eluding state police. After nearly crashing, Gonzalez was eventually pulled over. 

Questions: The Secret Service is now conducting an internal review of the incident at the White House

Virginia State Police said he had a map of D.C. with a circle drawn around the White House when he was arrested. They also allegedly found 11 different weapons in his car. 

Then on August 25, he was stopped while walking along the fence of the White House. In that incident, authorities found he had a hatchet in his waist band, according to ABC.

But when he allowed cops to search his car, they found no further weapons or ammo and he was not arrested.

Gonzalez served in Iraq from October 2006 to January 2008. 

He was discharged in September 2003 after completing his service obligation, but Gonzalez enlisted a second time, in July 2005, and served until his retirement in late 2012.

He will next appear in court in October. If convicted, he could get 10 years in prison.
