Thief: Michelle Roberts, 45, admitted stealing from her own relatives at a wake for her dead uncle

A woman who robbed her own family at a wake for her dead uncle has been jailed.

Michelle Roberts, 45, rifled through the handbags of mourners at an event to commemorate her uncle, Fred Rousell.

She took several bank cards, £80 in cash as well as £300 of John Lewis vouchers from relatives at the event in Southend, Essex.

Roberts was called 'mean and despicable' as she was given a six-month prison sentence after admitting theft and fraud.

Basildon Crown Court heard how she used the stolen cards to spend more than £400 on an online shopping spree from Asda and a music website.

She even tried to convince her widowed aunt that she had cancer in an attempt to collect money from her in the guise of charity donations.

Roberts, from Greenwich, South East London, had sneaked into a kitchen during the wake to pilfer their belongings. She pleaded guilty to four counts of theft and three of fraud.

The court heard that she took advantage of grieving relatives and broke her family apart at the wake in 2011.

Jamas Hodivala, prosecuting, told the court: 'For the last two years Mrs Rousell feels unable to put her husband to rest because of the incident 

'Obviously the incident caused her great upset and distress and, because Mrs Rousell's family were previously very close, she feels the family relationship has been broken as a result.'

Handing her the six-month jail sentence, Judge Jonathan Black said: 'I deal with these offences in detail because they fully reflect the mean and despicable way you committed the offences.

Guilty: Roberts admitted four charges of theft and three of fraud at Basildon Crown Court (pictured)

'You used time of great grief of Mr Rousell’s family to steal from vulnerable family and friends.'

Steven Fitzpatrick, mitigating, told the court his client should not be jailed as she suffers from depression and anxiety.

But Judge Black jailed Roberts for six months before defiantly telling her: 'Your manipulative behaviour has even extended to those people who wrote this report.'

The case comes a year after Roberts escaped a jail sentence at Dartford Magistrates’ Court for bogus charity collecting around pubs in Kent.
