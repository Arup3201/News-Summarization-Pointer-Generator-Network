An Arizona heart surgeon's claim that a diet of unprocessed foods - not necessarily low-fat foods - can prevent and even reverse heart disease has ignited the Internet.

Dr. Dwight Lundell has dished the dirt on 'what really causes heart disease' and he admits prescribing cholesterol-lowering medications, and a low-fat, high-simple carbohydrate diet for two-and-a-half decades was misguided.

'These recommendations are no longer scientifically or morally defensible,' he writes in an essay, that has been posted on some 250,000 Facebook pages since it appeared on a website called Tuned Body in December.

This idea may not seem all that revolutionary, but hearing Lundell's vivid imagery about what exactly processed foods actually do to the body would put anyone off their Twinkie.

He explains that this once 'healthy' diet actively destroys the walls of our blood vessels by causing chronic inflammation. This inflammation makes cholesterol stick to the walls, forming the plaques that eventually block them, resulting in a heart attack or stroke.

'When you spike your blood sugar level several times a day, every day, it is exactly like taking sandpaper to the inside of your delicate blood vessels,' he writes.

The former cardiac surgeon, who says he's 'peered inside thousands upon thousands of arteries' slams refined carbohydrates as well as the proportion of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in the Western diet.

Fruits and veggies: 'There is but one answer to quieting inflammation and that is returning to foods closer to their natural state,' Lundell writes

He said the heavy load of omega-6 acids vs omega-3 in corn and soybean oils - about 15:1 when it should be 3:1 - are too much for the body to process.

But he insists there's a silver bullet, and it's not all that surprising.

'There is but one answer to quieting inflammation and that is returning to foods closer to their natural state,' Lundell writes.

Don't eat anything your grandmother wouldn't recognize as food, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and lean protein, he recommends.

He says don't stress about saturated fats but make sure it's olive oil, grass-fed meat or full fat dairy that you're choosing over high-omega-6 processed foods.

'Since we now know that cholesterol is not the cause of heart disease, the concern about saturated fat is even more absurd today,' he writes.

Since penning the article, Dr. Lundell has come under fire from the blog Quackwatch, which revealed a past fraught with legal issues including having his medical license revoked in 2008.

The blog's author Dr. Stephen Barrett concluded, 'Dr. Lundell would like you to believe that he has special knowledge of heart disease prevention. I do not trust his advice.'

However, the basic ideas behind what Lundell writes in the essay have become far more accepted in the treatment of heart disease and other health problems since he first made his 'confession' in a 2007 book The Cure for Heart Disease.

Though regular exercise and reducing stress should be added to such a diet for ultimate health, other experts point out, disputing the 'silver bullet' claim.
