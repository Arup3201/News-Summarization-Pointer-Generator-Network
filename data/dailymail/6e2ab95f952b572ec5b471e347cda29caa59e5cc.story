This is the dramatic moment a diver in the Bahamas had a very close encounter with a fearsome lemon shark.

The 2.5metre long fish is shown baring a menacing set of teeth as it breaks the surface at Tiger Beach during sunrise.

Photographer Andrew Murch captured the shots during an eventful dive when the lemon sharks suddenly appeared within millimeters of his camera.

Fearless: Photographer Andrew Murch captured these images during a dramatic dive with lemon sharks

Several of the dangerous sharks appeared fascinated by their aquatic companion and decided to take a closer look.

The results are these beautiful images which couldn't paint are more intimate picture of one of the sea's most feared creatures.

Andrew said: 'It’s a difficult moment to 
capture because it is unusual to see sharks breaking the surface but at 
Tiger Beach in the Bahamas the sharks get very excited around divers and
 make very close passes.'

Surprisingly, Andrew,from Victoria, Canada, has never once been bitten throughout his dangerous expeditions underwater.

And he doesn’t even take precautions when underwater with the sharks.

He explained: 'I didn't feel the need for chainmail or other armour but I
 always wear a dark wetsuit and dark gloves just in case the sharks 
mistake my hands for bait. I also try to stay calm and avoid erratic 
jerky movements that might be interpreted as an animal in distress.'

Underwater friend: Lemon sharks have been known to attack humans but none have been fatal

'The shark seemed wary of me but tolerated my presence. I say tolerated 
because it clearly outranked me from a size perspective. I believe that 
the shark thought of me as another predator; albeit a clumsy one with 
strange flashing appendages.'

Andrew, who runs diving adventures company Big Fish Expeditions, came so
 close to the sharks on this dive he said they were touching his 
equipment.

'The lemons were practically bouncing off my underwater camera, but they
 showed no aggressiveness towards me during this photo shoot,' he said.

'They have never shown me any hostility. After nearly two decades of 
swimming with sharks, it has become quite clear to me that they are not 
interested in divers as a food source. We generally bring bait to 
attract the sharks to the boat and thats the only reason they come so 
close.'

The lemon shark, which is found in tropical waters around the Caribbean and west Africa, derives its name from its distinctive yellow colouring.

Although the species has been known to attack humans, none have been fatal and they generally survive well in captivity.
