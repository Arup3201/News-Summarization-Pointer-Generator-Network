Karen Cosford, 47, arriving at Bradford Crown Court, was jailed for three years over the sexual relationship

A prison nurse who had sex with a violent rapist in his cell while her colleagues stood guard has been jailed for three years.

A team of Karen Cosford’s colleagues were also jailed for misconduct after keeping her relationship with ‘evil’ lifer Brian McBride a secret – believing their discretion would be financially rewarded.

Married Cosford, 47, whose husband also worked in the prison service, sent the serial rapist a catalogue of texts telling him ‘you are my world’, ‘miss you so much’ and ‘can’t wait for you to get out’.

By chance her unwitting husband Derrie Cosford, a prison negotiator, became part of the investigation into McBride - who hinted of his wife's lies and deceit.

The shamed nurse's claims that she had been forced into the relationship were dismissed by a jury at Bradford Crown Court, who found her guilty of misconduct in a public office for the sexual relationship, failing to notify authorities that McBride had a phone and purchasing top-ups for him.

Carolyn Falloon, 50, and Jacqueline Flynn, 46, who both worked with Cosford on the healthcare wing at the high-security Wakefield Prison, West Yorkshire, were also convicted of failing to notify authorities about the affair and mobile phone.

A third colleague Kevin Wilson, 57, admitted misconduct in a public office at a previous hearing.

Prosecutors said the guilty officers were motivated by ‘greed’ and were duped by McBride’s claims of wealth on the outside.

Sentencing the group today Judge David Hatton QC said: ‘It’s a sad business indeed when four people with previous good character, public servants who have devoted years of their lives to their vocation, should find themselves being sentenced for having abused their positions of trust.’

Speaking to Cosford, the judge said: ‘You believed him to be a man of means and planned on continuing your relationship with him on the outside until you reached the conclusion that you had been strung along.’

During the four-week trial the court was told how Flynn admitted during police interviews that she stood guard outside McBride’s cell while the pair were inside and had heard them having sex.

The court heard that McBride, who was serving a life sentence for multiple offences of rape and violence, was in the healthcare centre as an in-patient and worked as a cleaner while he was there.

The affair came to light when a search of McBride on September 25, 2009 uncovered a mobile phone charger.

McBride was put in his cell while a thorough search of the wing was carried out and four mobile phones were subsequently discovered.

In the prison kitchen investigators 
found a photograph of a nurse, who was identified as Cosford, and an 
unsigned love letter hidden inside a bag of sugar.

The jury heard that McBride became agitated during the search, prompting a number of negotiators working in the Prison Service to visit him - one of whom was Mr Cosford.

During a negotiation McBride hinted to Mr Cosford that he had been having a relationship with his wife.

Mrs Cosford, of Altofts, West Yorkshire, later reported to prison authorities that McBride had raped and threatened to kill her family if she reported him.

She said she was forced to text the convict and write the love letter which read: ‘I didn’t realise how much I do miss you until I went on holiday.

‘You understand me more than anyone, we can have a wonderful future together, everything we talked about will happen, just give it time...

‘I can’t wait for us to continue our relationship outside of the confines of this place...’

Referring to him as her ‘knight in shining armour’, she added: ‘You are the most understanding, patient, manly, kind man that I have ever known.’

Wilson and Flynn were sentenced to 15 months in jail. Falloon was given a 21-month prison sentence.

Prison officer David Sunderland, 49, of Wakefield, was cleared of failing to notify the authorities about McBride’s phone.
