The Occupy Black Friday movement, which promises disruptive flash mobs, consumer zombies and carol singing over the course of today's sales, seems to be no match for the consumer might of thousands of bargain hunters who have turned up at stores in force.

The group, which has formed on the back of the Occupy Wall Street protests, hopes to persuade shoppers to buy local and turn their backs on mega retailers.

But at Macy's Herald Square in New York, just four activists chanted 'boycott Macy's' and 'stop supporting big corporations' as around 9,000 people queued to shop at the landmark department store this morning.

Diluted effort: The largely uncoordinated efforts of the mini-movement have so far proved to be no match for the 152 million shoppers predicted to hit stores this weekend

Stores across the U.S. continue to brace 
themselves for potential unrest as protesters from the Occupy Wall 
Street movement urge people to either forgo the annual retail frenzy, or to support smaller, local stores.

While there is little evidence of direct action so far today, each mini-protest promises some kind of surprise action on the day 
after Thanksgiving, which marks the traditional start of the holiday 
shopping season in the U.S.

But with thousands of shoppers turning out to find great deals this holiday, it looks as though U.S retailers are set to attract the National Retail Federation's predicted 152 million shoppers over the course of the holiday.

While shoppers camped outside stores in eagerness, groups going under the names Occupy 
Black Friday and Stop Black Friday said they would focus efforts on 
Target, Wal-Mart and Dick's Sporting Goods, though the net covers most 
major name retailers.

Their
actions are uncoordinated but hold similar themes of supporting small 
businesses while criticising the day's dedication to consumption and the
shopping frenzy that fuels big corporations.

In Seattle, protesters said they would drive to Wal-Mart stores to protest with other Occupy groups from around Washington state.

Washington D.C. is offering a ‘really, really free market,’ where people can donate items they don't want so others can go gift shopping for free.

Elsewhere the 75-person encampment in 
Boise, Idaho, planned to send ‘consumer zombies’ to wander around in 
silent protest of what they view as unnecessary spending.

In Chicago, protesters are planning to serenade shoppers with revamped Christmas carols about buying local.

Fears that shoppers camping out for Black Friday deals may secretly be Ocuupy Wall Street demonstrators have prompted some stores to demand tents are removed.

The annual tradition of bargain hunters hoping to be first in line is thought to be the perfect pretext for the anti-capitalist protesters to set up a permanent encampment outside businesses.

One of the stores - Best Buy in Roseville, California, claimed that having tents in front of the store is a liability issue.

But, as this has not been the case in previous years, those now forced to huddle up with only blankets and each other for warmth, are convinced the protests have caused the change of heart.

The Des Moines, Iowa, group plans flash mobs at three malls in an attempt to get people to think about what they're buying.

‘We didn't want to guilt-trip people at a mall,’ Occupy Des Moines organiser Ed Fallon said. ‘We wanted to get at them in a playful, friendly way, to support local businesses.’

Protesters say the movement should not take away money and seasonal jobs from the working-class majority it purports to represent.

They want the corporations to be the 
focus of any protests. But organisers do hope their actions drive people
to reconsider shopping at national chains and go to small locally-owned
stores instead.

That may 
not fly with small businesses wary of any association with the movement,
which presents itself as pushing back against corporate power.

‘If you ask, a lot of small business 
owners identify as business owners, not specifically small business,’ 
Jean Card, of the National Federation of Independent Business, said.

‘I would like to believe there is a 
silver lining, but I don't picture a frustrated consumer that can't get 
into a box store turning around and going to a small business. I see 
that person going home.’

Trying to shop exclusively local neglects
economies of scale, job specialisation and other benefits that big, 
multi-state corporations can bring, said George Mason University 
economist Russ Roberts.

‘Don't punish yourself by not shopping where you can get the best deal - that's foolish,’ he said.

Small businesses are not necessarily better employers in terms of wages, benefits, opportunities for advancement and other measures, said North Carolina public policy research expert John Quinterno.

He calculates small ‘mom-and-pops’, which he defines as businesses with fewer than 10 employees, account for nearly 80 per cent of employer firms in the U.S., but only about 11 per cent of the jobs.

‘Sometimes we romanticise small business - and I say this as a small business owner myself - so that it skews some of our debates about economic and labour policy,’ Mr Quinterno said.

‘It doesn't mean they aren't important. 
It just means that larger businesses tend to create a lot more 
value-added per job,’ the principal of public policy research firm South
by North Strategies said.

The protests are largely focused on shopping areas in affluent suburbs home to big chain stores. As with the entire movement, the protests bring with them a litany of causes.

In addition to protests of big chains, causes include clothes made from animal fur, McDonald's, homelessness and, in Las Vegas, the low gambling taxes paid by casinos.

The formula is ideal for the Occupy protests - many of whom have faced evictions from large-scale encampments in recent weeks.

With a large number of people in a confined space, the Black Friday protests present one of the earliest tests for the movement in its new, fragmented iteration.

Most protests plan to make a point and move on - a strategy they have implemented in some cities with targeted marches for specific causes since the camps were broken up.

‘It's not about specific occupation camps anymore,’ said protester Peter Morales of Austin, Texas. ‘It's more of, you know, real awareness of what's going on in our government.’

Another shop local movement, Small Business Saturday, was started last year to encourage people to shop at small businesses on the day after Black Friday.

But the Occupy groups are underwhelmed as this movement was started by American Express.

Last year, small retailers that accept American Express saw a 28 per cent increase in sales volume on Small Business Saturday from the same day the year before, the company says.

‘It's just another example of the banks and Wall Street trying to take the very real desires of working people to have a humane economic system and twisting it to their ends,’ said Peter Rickman of Occupy Milwaukee.

'Look, some people have printed out the deals two weeks ago. We're not getting to them. While we would like to dissuade the folks camping out and "occupying" Wal-Mart, they've already made their mind up. We're looking for the shoppers on the fence'

Pam Newman, Occupy Louisville

A former Best Buy employee, she would watch troves of wild-eyed shoppers kick, claw and scrape their ways to holiday deals and is now coy with the details of the Occupy Louisville protest.

‘There are some plans I can't talk about,’ she said, but added the focus will be on people who have not made up their minds.
