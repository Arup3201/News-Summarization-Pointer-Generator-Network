For Lady Harriet Brocket news that Angelina Jolie had had a double mastectomy gave rise to mixed feelings because just months earlier, she had made exactly the same decision.

The 38-year-old photographer wife of former I'm A Celebrity contestant, Lord Brocket has revealed that she had the surgery after being diagnosed with breast cancer last year.

Although she was given the option of a lumpectomy, which would have removed the cancer alone, Lady Brocket plumped for a double mastectomy to give herself a better chance of staying cancer free.

'The options were a lumpectomy or a mastectomy,' she revealed. 'If you have both breasts removed, there's a much better chance of ensuring that the cancer will not return and reconstruction gives better results if you have the treatment on both sides.' she told Hello! magazine.

According to experts, a double mastectomy can reduce the risk of breast cancer to almost nothing - in Jolie's case, from an 87 per cent chance to five.

Although Lady Brocket doesn't carry the same BRCA1 faulty gene that the Hollywood actress does, she sympathised with the star's decision.

'It doesn't matter who you are, if you don't have your health, nothing else is important,' she added.

'I feel very lucky to have had an early diagnosis and to have been able to make the right choice to give me the best chance of staying alive for my children.'

Once the decision to go ahead with the surgery had been made, Lady Brocket faced a battery of uncomfortable - and often painful - tests, a miserable experience compounded by the fact her mother had just been diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time.

She too was given the opportunity to have both breasts removed and in a strange twist of fate, mother and daughter were booked in to go under the knife in the same hospital on the same day, around the same time that actress Angelina was having her surgery in secret.

The operation itself took a gruelling seven hours and Lady Brocket was confined to a hospital bed for five days, only able to speak to her daughters, Amelia, three, and Iona, one, via Skype.

Today, she's still recovering and having to deal with the side effects of hormone treatment aimed at preventing the cancer from recurring.

But despite the trauma, she remains upbeat about her situation. 'It's a brave decision to have your breasts removed, but it's not the end of the world, which it could be if you don't have them checked. My strong message is please go and get checked - it may save your life.'
