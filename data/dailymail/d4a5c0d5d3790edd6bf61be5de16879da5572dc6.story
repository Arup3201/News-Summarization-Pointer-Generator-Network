One of Michael Jackson's friends who testified that he was not molested by the pop superstar has now changed his story as he fights for money from Jackson's estate.

Wade Robson, one of the top music choreographers who has worked with Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, got to know Michael Jackson decades ago when he began going for sleepovers at the Neverland Ranch.

The now-30-year-old Robson is changing his tune, however, as he filed legal requests for financial compensation from the singer's estate for 'childhood sexual abuse'.Â

The legal motion, which has been filed under seal so it is not available to the public, comes years after Robson made repeated public statements defending Jackson and denying any wrongdoing.

New story: Wade Robson, seen here in 2008, reportedly filed legal papers on May 1 claiming that Jackson's estate should pay him money for childhood sexual abuse

The two met when Robson was five years old and Jackson was in his late 20s or early 30s.

They bonded over a love of music and he repeatedly slept over his house and spent nights in the same bed as the much-older singer.

Robson played a pivotal role in the 2005 trial, when Jackson faced 14 counts relating to child molestation and conspiracy to molest minors.

He was found not guilty on all of the charges, and Robson was one of the star witnesses who defended Jackson, saying that he was never inappropriately touched or molested.

A similar defense was given by their mutual friend Macaulay Culkin, who also slept over the singer's ranch over a long period of time.

In the past eight years, Robson has made a name for himself in the entertainment world, becoming one of the most sought-after choreographers.

He has worked with Usher, Britney Spears, and NSYNC. His name hit the gossip columns in 2002 when Britney Spears' relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after she allegedly cheated on the NSYNC star with the choreographer.

Since then, Robson has worked on the show So You Think You Can Dance, and is currently in charge of Demi Lovato's choreography.

But now, TMZ is
 reporting that they heard from unidentified legal sources that Robson's
 legal team filed papers asking for an undisclosed sum from the Jackson 
estate on May 1. No other details about the filing have been released, 
but they reportedly give an explicit detail of the alleged assault.

News of the filing comes the same day as the late singer's autopsy report revealed that Michael Jackson tattooed his lips pink, permanently inked his eyebrows and relied on a dark tattoo to blend his hairline into his wig.

As the high profile trial of the singer's tour promoter, AEG, continues, a disturbing photograph of the fallen pop star's corpse was shown to the court on Monday by Dr Christopher Rogers.

His coroner's report described a man 
whose struggle to hide a skin pigmentation disease forced him to mask 
his true features but who would have lived a long life had he not 
overdosed on propofol.

The revelation of Jackson's permanent
 make-up comes during the trial brought by the singer's mother 
and children who claim AEG shares blame in his death for neglecting to 
vet and supervise Mr Jackon's doctor, Dr Conrad Murray.
