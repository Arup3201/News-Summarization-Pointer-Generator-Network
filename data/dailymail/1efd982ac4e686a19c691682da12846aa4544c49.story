The teen mom accused of abandoning her newborn in a dumpster says she thought the boy was dead when she threw him out with the trash, a Child Protective Services caseworker said in Houston yesterday.

The caseworker testified in an emergency custody hearing that the 16-year-old didn't even know she was pregnant when she went into labor and gave birth in her apartment bathtub.

After giving birth, the teen cut the boy's umbilical cord herself but thought her son was dead so placed him in the dumpster.

Resilient: Child protective services was granted temporary custody Wednesday of a newborn found alive in a Houston dumpster Tuesday morning. The mother has been identified as a 16-year-old who says she didn't know she was pregnant

Namesake: The baby boy was found my maintenance worker Carlos Michel (pictured). The mother decided to name the child after him

Apparently the teen's mother lives in Alvin, but she had been staying with her aunt while attending South Houston High School.

She says she has not spoken to her son's 22-year-old father in about six months.

A judge awarded CPS temporary custody of the child, but said she would allow the mother to visit the newborn if the attorney assigned to represent the baby agrees.

The caseworker asked the mom if she wanted to name her son, and she chose Carlos after the man who found the baby and saved his life.

The boy was found Tuesday morning at the Reserve Apartments by maintenance worker Carlos Michel, who heard what sounded like cat mewing coming from the dumpster.

Sad discovery: The baby was found stuffed in a trash bag among food containers, scraps and school homework

He investigated further and found the baby boy alive, stuffed in a white trash bag along with food containers, scraps and school homework.

Michel and another man took the baby to a nearby car to keep it warm while they waited for police and paramedics to arrive.

The boy was found purple and having a hard time breathing but was in good condition at Memorial Hermann Hospital yesterday.

The mother was also taken to the hospital for examination after being identified. Once released she will be questioned by police, who will then decide whether to bring up charges.

Both were still in the hospital as of Wednesday night, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Adding to the tragedy is the fact that Texas has a special law to help new mothers who can't take care of their children.

The Baby Moses law states that a babies up to 60-days-old can be dropped off without fear of prosecution at any hospital, fire station or ambulance station - as long as the baby is handed off to a person.

CPS is currently trying to figure out if there are any other family members who can look after the boy when he gets out of the hospital, or if he'll need to be placed in the foster care system.
