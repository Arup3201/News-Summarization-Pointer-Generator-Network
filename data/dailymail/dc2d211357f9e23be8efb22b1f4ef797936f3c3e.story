The World Cup is just nine days away and excitement is building. Each week our man in Brazil, Joe Callaghan, brings us the latest news and views from South America - as well as traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of exactly how the World Cup in Brazil is shaping up.

   ....................................................................................................................................................

Paris and the rest of the world will have to wait. The most expensive central defensive partnership ever assembled will not be on show in Goiania on Tuesday night.

Brazil's penultimate World Cup warm-up against Panama will feature David Luiz, Paris Saint-Germain's latest record-breaker, but club and country captain Thiago Silva has been left at base to fully shake off a niggle before real battle commences next week.

PSG's money men may have been able to put a price (£85million, give or take) on the Luiz-Silva tandem, even if some sceptics are convinced they have missed a decimal point on the former's world-record fee. But it's likely that Luis Felipe Scolari would be unable to do similar. For him, the duo who make up the beating heart of his defence are utterly priceless.

Central role: Neymar is the poster boy for Brazil's hopes at the World Cup this summer

Foundations: But Luiz Felipe Scolari has built his side on a firm defensive structure

No way through: David Luiz and Thiago Silva have been a major factor in Brazil's recent success

The game against Panama will mark the 21st match of Scolari's second stint at the helm of the Selecao. It's been a pretty successful 18 months in charge for the former World Cup winner, last summer's Confederations Cup victory the undoubted highlight.

Neymar is thrust forward as the poster boy of that victory and Big Phil's redesigned national team, but it is his defensive pairing who have been the true starting point, the bedrock for a construction job that the manager hopes will end on July 13 with a second crown.

A need to blood the previously untested Dante coupled with an injury here and there for the captain meant Scolari hasn't been able to pair Luiz and Silva together as much as he'd like - namely every minute of every game. But when he has done so, the results are staggering. On Scolari's watch, Brazil have a winning percentage of 83.33 percent when Luiz and Silva start together. Without them, that number plummets to 50 percent.

They have partnered up 12 times in his 20 games, with 10 wins (nine of which have come against teams who will feature at the World Cup) and two draws. Throw in their 50 percent rate of clean sheets and their momentous importance is clear.

Fearsome combination: Silva and Luiz have won 10 of their 12 appearances together under Scolari for Brazil

Expectation: Scolari is under massive pressure to win the World Cup for Brazil on home soil

'Thiago is a great friend, a great player and I get along very well with him,' said Luiz this week. The younger of the two by two years, he made his debut in 2010 against the USA inevitably alongside Silva. They are indeed friends, but Ant and Dec are friends, they're not going to win you a World Cup.

The narrative that they make for an odd couple may seem like an easy one. But it's also true. Opposites off the field, they're very different defenders too. And that might just be why it's worked so well.

Arguably the finest defender at this World Cup, Silva is a supreme reader of a game, his mental strengths, his concentration unparalleled. It is specifically in that part of the game that Luiz has suffered the brain fades that caused Jose Mourinho and others to lose a little trust in him as a last line. But he remains technically gifted and one hell of an athlete.

If Luiz has one of those 'moments' (of which he has had a lot fewer than most critics imply), there's a good chance Silva will have seen it coming. If Silva is technically outfoxed, there's a good chance Luiz will be able to scramble and have his partner's back.

Understanding: Silva and Luiz will become team-mates at Paris Saint-Germain next season

During that relentless run to the Confederations Cup crown, two Brazilian toddlers by the names of Lian and Murillo became viral sensations, being retweeted from coast to coast and sending social media into a frenzy.

The problem was almost nobody who saw the image of the two Disney-movie adorable kids sitting on the bonnet of a car knew who Lian and Murillo were. Instead they were told it was a picture of Thiago Silva and David Silva as children, not their mini-mes. And they lapped it up.

In that motivational poster font that jumped the shark around the same time as Big Brother, taglines like 'some things never change', 'childhood friends are the best friends' or 'started from the bottom, now we here' were added. The intervening 12 months have seen it pop up on twitter or blogs oh, about every five minutes, as people fall for it all over again.

Apart from the incredible likeness - especially so from mini-Thiago - the reason it's fooled so many for so long now is because it kind of just fits.

Watch Brazil's odd couple do their thing at the back and it's easy to believe, such is the incredible depth of understanding between them, that they've doing it since they were both fresh out of nappies and kicking worn-bald leather balls up dusty streets. They haven't. The scary thing is they've only been doing it for a couple of years. They've just made up for a lot of lost time.

Stand-in: Bayern Munich defender Dante is likely to play alongside Luiz in Silva's absence

Those who lamented Paraguay's failure to qualify for Brazil can celebrate last-minute redemption. No Roque Santa Cruz and co aren't going to feature after all but the World Cup's most famous semi-clad fan is.

Larissa Riquelme became a bit of a global sensation, being labelled the girlfriend of the World Cup, during the last tournament when she promised to run naked through Asuncion if Paraguay won it all.

Of course they didn't, but in the end the supermodel and actress did it anyway.

Fears that Paraguay's absence may mean her 15 minutes of fame were definitely up were alleviated yesterday though when she confirmed on Brazilian TV that she is on her way.

'As I always say, there will be a thousand 'Larissa Riquelmes' competing for the title, but they can never replace me. The others can be lovers, wives, muses, but I'm the only girlfriend of the Cup,' she said, sounding a bit on the over-possessive side.

Unfortunately for her followers, she is also the girlfriend of an actual human being - Paraguayan international Jonathan Fabbro.

With organisers upgrading their projected figures for foreign visitors from 600,000 to over 800,000, Brazil's domestic clubs must be hoping some of the tourists hang around to take a game or two in after the tournament.

The cradle for football the host nation may be, but you wouldn't know it from the desperate state of the domestic game. The Brasileirao championship takes a break for the duration of the tournament but in the nine rounds that have already taken place, the average attendance comes in just a sliver over 12,000.

That's respectable for the upper half of England's third tier. Not so much when you're talking about Brazil's biggest and brightest.

'I had spoken with the coach...they had already got the paperwork ready. We had a conversation but nothing that enthused me. I never wanted to play for another country.'

Bayern Munich defender Dante reveals he how he turned down Belgium's approach in 2009 and in the process gets a sharp dig in at Diego Costa, who was clearly 'enthused' enough by Spain's advances to jump ship.

Denial: Brazil defender Dante was not interested in representing Belgium at international level

Jibe: Dante's comments could be perceived to be targeted at Diego Costa who chose Spain over Brazil

Brazil's stadiums are largely good to go - handy that, seeing as the thing kicks off next week - but they will not be mobile-friendly.

3G is a no-go zone even during Brazilian league games at the likes of the Maracana or the Corinthians Arena. So sack the selfies, turn off Twitter and watch the game. It's a World Cup after all.

Eyes on the pitch: Selfies are popular, as shown by this picture of England footballers Daniel Sturridge, Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain but they may not be possible in Brazilian football stadiums due to a lack of 3G

A whole pile better than in Miami, that's for sure.
