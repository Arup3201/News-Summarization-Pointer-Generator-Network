Southampton squandered the chance to climb back into the top four as West Brom striker Saido Berahino’s early goal dealt a fresh blow to their faltering Champions League hopes.

It took all of 72 seconds for Berahino to notch his 17th goal of the season as the Baggies made it just one defeat in 11 matches in all competitions under Tony Pulis and moved eight points clear of the bottom three.

It was, however, another sobering afternoon for the Saints who would have leapfrogged Arsenal into the top four with a victory.

Ronald Koeman’s team have now won just one of their last five Premier League outings and there was further evidence here that their Champions League ambitions are fizzling out.

‘You need to pay more attention at the start of the game,’ Koeman said. ‘I was always realistic. Never was I thinking we would simply qualify for the Champions League as there are a lot of big teams normally fighting for those positions in the table.

‘We are trying to win more points than last season, playing the way we do, then we will see what happens.’

Front-foot football has been one of Albion’s hallmarks at home under Pulis and their flying start was a case in point.

Chris Brunt’s hanging free-kick from close to the halfway line was only half-cleared by Maya Yoshida and Berahino made Saints pay with an emphatic strike into the top corner from 10 yards out — his first touch of the game.

‘It was a wonderful strike and goal,’ Pulis said. ‘There’s no questioning his talent. He is the icing on cake, that extra bit of quality every team is looking for.’ 

Sadio Mane wasted one excellent chance but the villain-in-chief for Saints was Graziano Pelle. The Italian was guilty of missing a sitter in the 68th minute when he somehow failed to connect with Ryan Bertrand’s ball across the face of goal.

The one moment of controversy late on came in the visitors’ area when Stephane Sessegnon was correctly cautioned for diving.

‘If Sess has dived I will have a word with him, I won’t have that,’ Pulis added.

West Brom goalscorer Berahino was then forced off with injury early in the second half
