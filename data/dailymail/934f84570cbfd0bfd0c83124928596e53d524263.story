Scandal: Motorists are facing huge increases in residential parking prices

Drivers are being hit with a ‘green’ tax of up to £391 a year as part of  sky-high charges simply to park in their own streets.

The fees – which grade cars according to their carbon dioxide emissions – come as motorists across the country face rises of up to 400 per cent for their annual permit.

Councils are also raising millions by ramping up pay-and-display charges and visitor permit prices above the rate of inflation, a survey revealed.

Additionally, the hours during which drivers must pay are being extended in some areas to include evenings, Sundays and bank holidays. More than half of local authorities have raised charges in the past year, by an average of nearly 50 per cent.

Edmund King, of the AA, said: ‘Raising parking charges is another attack on the motorist, who is already suffering record fuel and insurance prices.’

A survey found 57 of 96 councils had increased their charges or extended charging hours. Of the 46 which set out their higher charges, the average increase was 44 per cent.

The green tax affects drivers in Islington, North London. It means those with a standard family car pay £109 a year – itself an increase from £85 last year.

But more polluting cars are charged up to £391 a year, up from £200 last year. The charges apply regardless of how many miles the car is driven – meaning someone who drives a ‘greener’ car more often could pay less despite emitting more carbon dioxide.

In Barnet, North London, the cost of visitors’ permits has risen by 300 per cent to £4 per car per day, and residents’ permits by 150 per cent from £40 to £100 per car.

Driven to rip-off residents: Woking Council has hit motorists with a 400 per cent rise for the cost of a parking permit

Mother of three Millie Parker, 41, 
from Barnet, said: ‘I can’t believe that I have to pay £100 a year to 
park outside my own house.’ She revealed how she had to pay £32 so eight
 friends could park for her daughter Scarlett’s birthday party. Last 
year the cost was £8.

‘How do they justify such a huge 
increase? If I have three other mums around for a coffee, I have to pay 
£12 for three visitors’ vouchers,’ she told the Sunday Times. ‘It’s 
definitely a way for the council to raise money, because there were 
enough spaces under the old prices.’ In Woking, Surrey, a resident’s 
permit now costs £50 a year, up from £10, a 400 per cent increase.

Havering, Essex Residents £13.20 to £20 52% increase

Bedfordshire Pay and Display 50p to £1 for two hours 100% increase

Manchester City Centre Pay and Display £2.20 to £2.70 per hour 22% increase

Next year, Middlesbrough council will 
start charging residents to park on their own street for the first time,
 with each permit costing £20.

In August, Westminster council 
announced charges for parking in the London borough on Sundays. 
Motorists will also face pay-and-display charges until 8.30pm instead of
 6.30pm.

Councils are supposed to set fees to 
cover the costs of enforcing the restrictions, but are accused of 
raising charges to make a profit. They face a High Court challenge by 
campaigners, who are demanding the charges be cut. An RAC Foundation 
report found councils may be acting illegally.

Barnet Council said: ‘We have held 
down the prices of residents’ parking for several years, but 
circumstances dictate that we have to bring them in line with other 
London boroughs.’

Peter Box of the Local Government 
Association defended the charges. He said: ‘Money raised from parking is
 retained locally for funding things like street lighting, road 
maintenance and parking enforcement. Motorists who pay for parking 
benefit from the things it pays for.’

Residents are being hit with a ‘green’ tax as part of sky-high charges for parking permits.

To park outside their own homes, people in Islington, North London, pay according to the carbon dioxide emissions from their vehicle.

It means anyone with a standard family car pays £109 a year - up from £85 last year.

More polluting cars pay up to £391 a year - up from £200 last year.

The charges apply regardless of how many miles the car is driven - meaning someone who drives a ‘greener’ car more often could pay less despite emitting more carbon dioxide.

In Wandsworth, south west London, residents pay £120 a year or £30 a year if their car has lower emissions.
