A rare British car could fetch a small fortune after being unearthed lying untouched for years in a barn.

The Doretti was found by mechanic Martin Hamlyn-White, in Hennock, Devon, who didn’t have a clue how valuable it was.

There were only ever 245 Dorettis made by The Swallow Coachbuiding Company of Staffordshire and until a few days ago the whereabouts of just 179 were known.

That number is now 180 after the shock find by Mr Hamlyn-White.

It belonged to a pair of farming brothers who used it up until the mid 1970s.

It is now set to be auctioned on February 21 and despite needing restoration could fetch £20,000 or more. It has already attracted massive worldwide interest which is growing.

Mechanic Mr Hamlyn-White was called in to assess the vehicle by auctioneers Rendells after the death of the car’s owner.

He said: 'I had no idea what the car 
was and absolutely shocked to hear they can go for so much money. I was 
thinking perhaps it was a few hundred pounds’ worth. It took a while to 
find out what it was because they are so rare.

'Eventually
 it became clear it was this long lost make of car. It’s not in bad 
condition - it has an aluminium body so that’s not corroded.

'I was quite impressed with the chassis. I didn’t think there’d be much left of it to be honest but actually it’s pretty solid.

'It will be a great project for somebody. It will be fascinating to see how it turns out if it does get restored.'

Production of the Doretti ran from 1954-55 with the car based on the Triumph TR2.

It was targeted at the Californian market the name a marketing ploy to appeal to the Americans’ love of all things ltalian.

The 1991cc engine was a straight four fed by twin SUs and the four-speed gearbox could be had with an optional overdrive.

David Ship of Rendells said there had already been interest from Australia, Europe, America and the UK.

'It took us several days to identify it because parts that look like an AC and others like a Triumph,” he said.

'We finally found the paperwork, however, and there’s a lot of interesting ephemera that comes with the car.

Rare: The car is right-hand drive which is rare and the car was re-registered in 1965 hence its C-plate

It’s right hand drive too which is rare. Sadly I don’t have the original log book and for some reason it was re-registered in 1965, hence the C plate.

'This is going to be a very interesting project for someone.'

He said the thrill of a genuine barn find was rare.

'I’ve only ever had four in my 30-year career. Once I discovered a Lanchester that had been bricked up during the war.

'We couldn’t work out why the garage interior was too short but then we went through the wall and discovered the car which had been put there at a time when everything had to be submitted as scrap metal for the war effort.

Project: Auctioneers hope the car will be an interesting project for someone to work on

Restoration: If the car was spruced up it could be worth at least £50,000 to £60,000

'It’s always good fun and the best thing when you find something as rare as the Doretti is that there will be international interest.

'I’ve recently seen a badly restored example on offer with a guide price of £11000 to £12000. A Doretti in the States fetched the equivalent of £120,000.

'It’s hard to say what it will fetch but if someone was to spend £20,000 restoring it they would have a car worth at least £50,000 to £60,000 - maybe double that.'

Also unearthed at the Hennock property which had lain untouched for years were two rotting Triumph Spitfires, a Reliant Scimitar, a restorable Triumph XR2 and two VW Polos.

A Triumph 2.5Pi is still there but the building it’s in has collapsed making retrieval a health and safety nightmare.

Elsewhere in the extensive grounds are the remains of several other cars too, now nothing more than scrap.
