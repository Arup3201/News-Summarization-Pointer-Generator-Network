Most women are happy to powder the nose they were born with while a few feel the need to give it a modest cosmetic tweak.

But Cindy Jackson is so obsessed with ensuring hers remains the height of fashion she has given it a new look THREE times.

Now she proudly displays what is currently the most sought-after in the industry -  a Kate Middleton/Angelina Jolie hybrid.

To create her perfect nose, Cindy, 58, travelled to Croatia where, she says, talented surgeons operate for lower fees.

She took pictures of Kate Middleton and Angelina Jolie's noses and 'Photoshopped' versions of her own nose 'erasing the bridge and lifting the tip' to show the surgeon the desired outcome.

After having the procedure last month, Cindy has now finally announced: 'This will be my last nose job.'

The bill for her three nose operations amounts to £10,000.

She had her first one when she was 34, deciding to replace her original nose - 'which she never liked'.

But it failed to leave her looking 'any different' so she went under the knife again two years later to get a 'scooped' nose modelled on Nicole Kidman's. Her contentment lasted 22 years until Cindy decided it was 'too Eighties' and began planning something more 'elegant' and 'timeless'.

Cindy, who is a cosmetic surgery adviser, says she is not alone in wanting a nose like Kate or Angelina.

'I do have clients that repeatedly want Kate Middleton noses. They say I want Kate Middleton's nose, I want Angelina Jolie's nose, and, I'm thinking, so do I.'

Cindy, a farmer's daughter from Ohio, said as a young girl she soon realised 'that guys and girls with a certain look had more power'.

She has now had 57 cosmetic changes - at a total cost of £67,000 - including a jaw re-shape, cheek implants, an eye lift and a chin bone reduction. 

In fact, she has recreated every part of her body apart from her feet and arms, but says: 'The arms are next.'

The Mail on Sunday has been campaigning for tougher regulation of the cosmetic industry since last year.

Through the Stop Cosmetic Surgery Cowboys campaign, this newspaper has called for measures including a minimum standard for surgeons, proper regulation for those practising cosmetic surgery and an end to hard-sell tactics that see special offers and glossy advertising undermine the seriousness of the procedures involved.

Interviewed after an Intelligence Squared debate last week, held for the Selfridges Beauty Project, Cindy said: 'There's a lot of really glossy and seductive information on the internet and people use it.'
