Manuel Pellegrini and his Manchester City squad jetted in to Kansas Airport on Monday, ahead of their four-match tour of the US. 

Their American jaunt kicks off with a match against Sporting Kansas on Thursday, before they compete with AC Milan, Liverpool and Olympiacos for the Guinness International Champions Cup.

Samir Nasri was in particularly high spirits as the Premier League champions landed, posing for photos for fans and pulling funny faces towards the waiting cameras.
