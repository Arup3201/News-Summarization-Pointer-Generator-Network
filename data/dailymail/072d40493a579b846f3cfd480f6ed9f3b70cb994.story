A teacher has been charged with sending dirty Facebook messages to a 15-year-old pupil asking for naked pictures of herself.

Dustin James Mullins, 22, had just started as a substitute teacher at Henry J. Kaiser Elementary School in Ravenswood, West Virginia, when he was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of soliciting a minor.

He is alleged to have told the girl: 'You're very pretty in the face and have a great body... That normally means you're hot... some of those holes in your jeans always made me wonder what you looked like without anything on...'

The complaint filed to Jackson Magistrate Court claimed he also said: 'It has been a fantasy of mine to get you alone for a while I must say...'.

He went on to say: 'You should send me a pic ... cause I've wanted to see you without clothes on for a looooooong time. U don't have to ... I'll just fantasize.'

The girl showed the messages to her mother, who contacted Ravenswood High School's prevention officer.

According to the Charleston Daily Mail, Mullins told officers he sent the messages from his mobile phone.

Mullins told police the girl was a pupil in his class when he was doing his student teaching at Parkersburg South High School (above) in Wood County from October to November last year

Detective R.H. Mellinger said in the complaint that Mullins confessed to 'each and every message contained in the aforementioned Facebook Messenger print-out'.

Mullins told police the girl was a pupil in his class when he was doing his student teaching at Parkersburg South High School in Wood County from October to November last year.

According to the complaint, the History teacher said he was 'just not real sure' what his intentions would be if he were to meet the girl outside the school environment.

Mullins appeared at Jackson Magistrate Court on Wednesday charged with soliciting a minor via computer, use of obscene matter with intent to seduce a minor and two counts of attempt to commit a felony. He was released on $150,000 (Â£90,000) bond.

Superintendent Blaine Hess said Mullins was no longer working in Jackson County.

But he would not say if Mullins had been suspended and what, if any, disciplinary action was being taken.
