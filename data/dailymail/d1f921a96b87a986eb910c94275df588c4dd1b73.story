Vladimir Putin would welcome Scottish independence because it would weaken Britain, the outspoken Education Secretary Michael Gove has claimed.

Mr Gove said a break up of the United Kingdom would put Russia in a 'stronger position' to dictate to the world.

He claimed Britain was the 'second principal beacon of liberty' in the world and its break up would weaken the West.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said Britain was the 'second principal beacon of liberty' in the world and Scottish independence would leave it weakened

The Tory Cabinet minister, who was born in Edinburgh and raised in Aberdeen, said a 'Yes' to independence vote would be cheered among Britain's enemies.

Mr Gove, speaking during a debate on independence at the Chalke Valley History Festival yesterday, also attacked independence campaigners for portraying England as a 'loads'a money' nation which was 'meaner' than Scotland.

The Education Secretary's controversial remarks come after Alex Salmond sparked controversy after declaring that he admired 'certain aspects' of Mr Putin's leadership.

Mr Salmond's comments came at the height of the crisis over Russia's annexation of Crimea.

The First Minister said during an interview in March that it was a 'good thing' Mr Putin had restored Russian pride.

But the Tory MP said: 'Think globally. Think what would happen if Scotland and England broke up. Do we think that Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin would think 'oh that's a pity?'

'Or do you think he would think: 'Ah look, the second principal beacon of liberty in the world is a little more unstable. That plinth has been broken. I'm in a stronger position to do what I want'?

'Similarly, if we think of all of those across the globe who are against the principles of freedom and who might wish to cause us and our friends harm, would they regard the break up of the United Kingdom as a welcome weakening in the West's defences? Of course they would.'

Mr Gove also attacked the SNP's attempt to play England and Scotland off against each other.

He said: 'There's one thing that the Yes vote - the independent vote - campaigners in Scotland are saying. They're saying that England is somehow a different country. A narrower and a meaner country than Scotland.

'They're basically trying to say that England is a "loads'a money' country, and Scotland a warmer place".

SNP leader Alex Salmond sparked controversy earlier this year after admitting there were 'some aspects' of Vladimir Putin's leadership that he admired

A Yes Scotland spokesperson said Mr Gove was guilty of 'hyperbole' and likened his remarks to Labour peer Lord Robertson, the former Nato general secretary, who said independence would be 'cataclysmic' for the world.

The spokesman said: 'This hyperbole from Michael Gove is no less embarrassing to the No campaign. Scotland will be a valued friend and ally of the rest of the UK and western world, just like a myriad of other independent European nations.

'It is Michael Gove's Tory government which has been caught out trying to enlist Putin's support to oppose Scottish independence - just as they have been going round the world briefing against Scotland.'
