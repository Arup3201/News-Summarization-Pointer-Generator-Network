Dave King vowed to continue the fight for control of Rangers on Thursday night as he broke his silence on the £16million bail-out put forward by his alliance of investors.

The South Africa-based businessman has flown home from the UK without an agreement in place but is adamant that doesn't mean his plan is dead.

King expressed frustration with aspects of the process since arriving in the UK to meet Ibrox directors nine days ago.

Chief among those has been Mike Ashley — regarded as the main rival for the Ibrox throne — snubbing a request for talks.

King questioned Ashley's motives as he alluded to reports the Newcastle United owner had sought control over Rangers trademarks during previous discussions about a loan.

The former club director held talks with Sandy Easdale on Wednesday but did not reach an accord with the man who holds voting rights over a 26 per cent stake in the club, providing the power of veto over a new share issue.

However, King provided Easdale with further information about his group's plan yesterday and insisted he would not back off.

'We have a lot of work to do over the next few months to regain the club,' he said. 'I would not be here without the support of the fans and neither would my co-investors. We are going to need to draw on your support again over the coming months.'

He added: 'Over the last few weeks Paul Murray, George Letham and I have constructively engaged the Rangers board and (at the request of the board) Sandy Easdale regarding our proposal to invest £16million into the club as soon as is practically possible.

'When investing in any public company, there are numerous regulatory and compliance requirements that have to be dealt with. There are also SFA compliance issues that arise when investing in a football club in Scotland.

'An obvious further complication in Rangers' case is the seeming lack of authority of the board to make decisions without reference to key shareholders who appear to be 'the power behind the throne'.

'Prior to commencing the implementation issues referred to above, it is necessary to reach an in-principle agreement with the board that can then be put to shareholders.

'In this regard, it is important to recognise that the so-called Easdale Block represents more than 25 per cent of the shares in issue and could therefore block the implementation of our proposal even if recommended by the board.

'Likewise, a combination of other shareholders could veto our proposal. I attempted to meet with Mr Ashley on my visit but neither he, nor his colleague, Mr [Keith] Bishop, acknowledged my request for a meeting. 

This is their right but it is unfortunate given the concerns from supporters that Mr Ashley is using his shareholder status to put pressure on the board to alienate the rights and trademark of the club in favour of his personal interest.

'I will make a separate announcement and appeal to fans on this topic at the appropriate time.'

Sportsmail revealed earlier this month that the King group were planning a £16million investment in return for a 51 per cent stake acquired via a new share issue.

That initial proposal has been modified to contain a loan element that addresses the fact the club may run out of cash before any share issue could take place.

The cash input, however, will only happen if the King group gain effective control of the boardroom.

'Our initial proposal to the board was to invest the full £16million by way of equity at 20p per share,' said King.

'The board requested that we consider a debt/equity mix that would reduce dilution for existing shareholders and allow the debt component to be advanced prior to the extended time frame required for the approval of additional equity.

'We are amenable to this and to working with the board on the mechanics necessary to ensure that this is achieved, provided the full investment is recognised by way of board representation.

'We wish to appoint an equal number of members to the board and have the key say regarding the appointment of the chairperson.

'We will not invest funds and let the existing board determine how these funds are spent. That has not worked well in the past.

'The board has apparently engaged constructively on our proposal while advancing its own points as to what it believes is in the best interest of the club and its shareholders.

'Sandy Easdale has similarly apparently engaged constructively, including highlighting some concerns. I have today responded to these concerns in writing.'
