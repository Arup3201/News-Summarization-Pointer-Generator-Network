When angelic looking J-J falls into his mum Bobbi's embrace, the nine-year-old from Southampton seems like any other loving son, but the truth behind their relationship is far more disturbing.

In reality, moments of affection are few and far between because Bobbi suffers from child-on-parent violence, an extraordinary type of abuse victims are often too ashamed to come clean about.

Nine-year-old J-J constantly launches violent attacks on his mother -- punching and kicking her, throwing objects at her head and viciously pulling her hair. On one occasion he even tried to stab her and has plotted to kill her.

Bobbi from Southampton suffers from child-on-parent violence where her nine-year-old son viciously attacks her on a daily basis

And Bobbi is not alone. According to a new Channel Five documentary, My Violent Child, which is hoping to lift the lid on this taboo topic, helplines receive 11,000 calls a year about child-on-parent abuse.

Despite being trapped in an abusive relationship in her own home, Bobbi is dedicated to helping J-J, who also lives with step-dad Lee and his two older sisters, overcome his bouts of uncontrollable violence.

'J-J has got the most awful temper. He's so normal looking, but inside his head there's so much going on,' she says.

'We've had incidents when he's wrecked 
the bedroom and barricaded himself in. He's hit everybody punched me, 
kicked me and pulled my hair.

'He's tried stabbing me and plotted to kill me in the middle of the night.'

'But I've put up with this type of behaviour from J-J for so long, I've become immune to it.'

In an interview with The Mirror Bobbi admitted, 'We had to take away all the knives, scissors, anything that was sharp.'

'He told his sister he wanted her to get a knife, and said when I was asleep that night he was going to stab me.

'She was distraught and came to tell me but I told her he couldn’t because there was nothing in the house to do it with.'

J-J has had various differing diagnoses -- ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder), ODD (Oppositional Defiance Disorder) and OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).

But whatever syndrome he may suffer from, J-J knows he's not like most other children.

'My mum would probably describe me as quite a strange child,' he says.

'Sometimes I shout at people and call
 them mean names. And also I can really hurt people. Sometimes when I'm 
really angry mum calls me the Incredible Hulk.'

For step-father Lee, coping with J-J's outbursts is a constant battle.

'It's
 horrendous. I don't think there are many kids like this. I've had so 
many experiences with him. The worst one I think can of is when he 
sprayed air freshener in my eyes,' he says.

Video footage from Bobbi's phone aired during the documentary gives a distressing glimpse of one of J-J's rages.  

He launches at his mother with full force first punching and kicking her then grabbing her hair whilst screeching, 'I hate you'.

Bobbi
 struggles to set herself free, then restrains him in his duvet before 
putting him out of the house into the garden. But then J-J starts thrashing
 at the glass with a garden spade and smashing his scooter against the 
patio.

'You can't get him back down from where he's gone. It's as if something switches off in his brain and you can't say, "Lets talk about this",' she says.

J-J's violence also flared up at school, which has led to him being expelled.

'The worst thing I've ever done is put a 
teacher in hospital because I broke her wrist and put another teacher in 
hospital because I almost detached her retina,' he explains.

'The school didn't handle him very well. The teachers didn't understand him very well, which made his behaviour even more challenging,' says Bobbi.

Bobbi started noticing J-J's violent behavior from when he was a baby, but the aggression got gradually worse.

Along with the violence, getting J-J to do the simplest tasks like put his coat or shoes is an immense challenge. On a good day it will take Bobbi two hours.

After six months of being home schooled, Bobbi managed to get J-J a place at a new school.

And with the help parenting practitioners Islay Downey and Angela Bates at Southampton Council she's also made progress with J-J's behaviour.

Bobbi has given J-J more independence and freedom, while implementing firm house rules.

J-J is still prone to outbursts but is slowly learning to control his aggression.

'J-J was a miracle baby - we never 
expected to have a boy. I was told I had a genetic disorder which would 
mean a boy wouldn't survive,' says Bobbi.

'I
 know it sounds odd but I'm lucky that I'm the one calming him down. At 
the moment, I'm the only one who can calm him down and that makes me 
feel special.'

Luckily for Bobbi, she has a willing partner to combat the abusive cycle.

'I just like to be me,' says J-J. 'But I'd rather be me and not kick-off. I don't really like being naughty. It doesn't make me feel good.'
