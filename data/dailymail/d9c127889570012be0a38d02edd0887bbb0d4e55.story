For those hoping that a decent rugby game had arrived, think again. For Sidhe’s Rugby Challenge 2 takes all fans’ wishes and boots them firmly into touch.

A lot of this is down to fundamental flaws in its gameplay. Looking past the shoddy animation and terrible character models, the AI just can’t understand formation.

Not fun: Although these screens look promising, in action, the game doesn't capture the sport very well

This effectively takes away any sort of structured attack – resulting in most matches looking like a blend of hot potato and playground favourite ‘IT’.

Passing is clunky and unresponsive – a quick tap firing the ball the length of the pitch one minute or an ineffective pop pass the next. At the breakdown, it’s nearly impossible to use your backs given how fast (and offside) the other team close you down and the ref will almost always get in the way.

Defence is not much better. Simply putting the controller down is almost as effective as playing. The AI will tackle anything that moves, while the clunky battle at the breakdown doesn’t really take into account team momentum. When playing against the computer, rarely does the opposition’s scrum-half manage to pass it wide, opting mostly to charge in himself.

Then there are the set pieces – which are some of the most boring yet in the genre. Scrums involve pushing two thumbsticks the direction you want your team to push. And kicking and line-outs are a case of timed presses when at the correct point on a metre. Not only that, but there are a complete lack of set-plays, so any tactics go out of the window.

You’re also constrained to using a behind-the-action camera view. Although it gives you the choice of a sideline and closer-to-the-action camera, both are nigh on unplayable.

The best thing about this game are the graphics, but even these fall well short. Given the attempted TV-style presentation during matches, it’s hard to avoid the shoddy, gormless character models that plague each cutscene.

Boring: Scrums and other set pieces are cumbersome and the lack of set plays does nothing to help matters

Equally poor is the game’s commentary. With the likes of Grant Nisbett and All Black legend Justin Marshall at the helm, it’s a shame that it just doesn’t work.

Both are equally annoying, and chime in with observations that rarely have anything to do with what’s going on. ‘I agree’ is as far as interaction between the two go and the historical facts Nisbett treats you to before each match are equally as stilted.

All of the above obliterate any sort of redeeming qualities the game features – be that a large selection of licensed teams, varied game modes (including the Lions tour) and character customisation.

The long wait for a decent rugby game continues.
