The expected flirtation between Mark Wright and Emily Scott on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here is well under way.

Since Miss Scott's sudden arrival in the jungle, interest in the relatively unknown Australian model has been rife.

And while the pretty blonde is certainly getting along famously with Wright, he's certainly not the first English celebrity who's eye she has caught.

Pop star marriage: I'm A Celebrity contestant Emily Scott was married to Ritchie Neville of 5ive in 2008

The 28-year-old dated David Walliams in 2006, but something that has been kept very well under the radar is her marriage to former pop star Ritchie Neville.

Miss Scott wed the singer, of boy band 5ive, in 2008 after the pair met on Sky One show Cirque de Celebrité the year before.

The married in secret in Henley-On-Thames in October 2008 and moved to Sydney, where Neville still resides.

'We are both quite private people,' Scott told Sydney's The Sunday Telegraph in 2009. 'We wanted to have a lot of time to ourselves and I guess we didn't really want the attention.

'It was a beautiful wedding, a stunning wedding in the countryside in England. We were planning on settling in Australia for the rest of our lives. It was a whirlwind.'

The marriage ended just four months later, after Scott claimed her husband cut her with glass during an argument at their home on Sydney's Northern Beaches, leaving her with a scar on her head.

'It was a hard break-up, a sudden one as well,' she told The Sunday Telegraph.

'There's an interim AVO out against him that the police took out and I am a witness in that case.'

NSW police took out the AVO (Aggravated Violence order) against Neville, but the case was dismissed when Scott failed to show up to court.

So far, Neville has not acknowledged 
his ex-wife's presence on the reality show and her flirtation with 
Wright on his Twitter page.

The 32-year-old dated Billie Piper at the height of 5ive's fame.

On Saturday night's episode of I'm A Celebrity, TOWIE star Mark admitted that he had lusted after Emily during her modelling days for lads' magazines.

'I know Emily Scott,' he told her. 'I used to fancy you back in the day when I was young.  You used to do magazines right,  Zoo, FHM?  They were my perving years when I used to buy all those magazines when I was about 19.'

Later in the Bush Telegraph Wright added: 'She seems like a lovely girl.  She’s obviously a pretty girl.  There’s no denying that but today I was in the pond and I asked her surname and she said 'Scott' and I just thought, "no way.”

“When I was about 18 she used to be one of my favourites.  It’s really weird for me.  She used to be on my wall.  Mmm.  Interesting.'

Later on, Pat grilled Mark on the subject. 'Emily, Mark?  What do you reckon eh?  Used to be your pin up?' he asked.

'I can’t believe that.  I can’t believe that’s her,' Mark told Pat and Dougie.  'When you get out, Google her and see how hot she used to be.  Like Carmen Electra hot.  She had exactly the same kind of look.'

When Pat pointed out that Emily still is 'hot,' Mark insisted: 'Yes, she’s stunning but she was in a different league before.
