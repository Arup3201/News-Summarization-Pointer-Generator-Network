A woman has become an internet sensation after appearing in a series of hilarious poses on eBay selling her deliberately 'ugly' Christmas jumpers.

Deb Rottum, 45, from Tampa in Florida, spends hours painstakingly turning second-hand sweaters into 'hideous' festive creations by sewing on tinsel, bells and even cuddly toys.

And whenever the mother-of-three updates her eBay store 'Deb's Handmade Ugly Tacky Christmas Sweaters' she poses in the new addition.

Quirky: Ms Rottum's 'ugly' Christmas jumpers have become a huge hit - despite their quirky looks

But while the jumpers have proved a hit, it is the semi-terrified facial expression and wooden pose adopted in all the photos that have turned Ms Rottum's business into a smash-hit success.

Indeed, so popular has Ms Rottum become, she is now toying with setting up her own ugly jumper factory in order to meet demand.

Ms Rottum, who first hit upon the idea of flogging awful Christmas jumpers last year, said: 'People host 'Tacky Christmas Sweater' parties every Christmas.

"I've always been quite creative, so one year I thought I'd give it a go and everybody said mine was the tackiest - it was quite a compliment.

'Some people and businesses even have competitions to find the most tasteless jumpers, which is why I think my creations are so popular.

'I know it's a cheating a bit if someone wins by wearing one of my creations, but I don't mind - I like knowing I'm the best at making something so ugly.'

Ms Rottum sells her hideous creations for up to £50, and is struggling to keep up with orders because she can only make two in an evening.

Toned down: Not every jumper is festooned with tinsel - this red number is relatively toned down and stylish

'I go through thrift stores and charity shops, as well as boot sales and craft fairs, just to get as much festive rubbish as possible to sew onto the jumpers,' she explains.

"Last year someone saw one of my jumpers and asked where they could buy one. It was a lightbulb moment - I couldn't believe anybody would actually pay for them, so I started making them as fast as I could.

'I sold about 30 for Christmas 2013, but I had supply issues because I didn't really know where to go to get the raw materials.Now I know where to get them from, so I can make a couple every night.

'I've probably made about 200 jumpers this year so far, and I've got another couple of hundred orders to get made before Christmas.'

She added: 'Santa has his elves, and I'm seriously considering opening my own factory.'

Busy: So popular have Ms Rottum's quirky designs proved, she is even contemplating setting up a factory

Massive teddy bears, penguins, moose, polar bears and even a Christmas monkey are among the most popular designs - even if they are, as Ms Rottum admits, in questionable taste.

'I just try and come up with something that's themed, even if the theme is 'ugly,' she explained. 'They're quite clearly not in the best taste, but they certainly serve a purpose, and also nobody can see them and not get in the mood for Christmas.'

The budding designer also opened up about her signature pose, which involves wide eyes and a toothy grimace-like smile, while standing with her arms by her sides and clenched fists pointing at the ground.

'I don't pose like that because I have a gun pointed at me, that's for sure,' she revealed. 'I stand like that so people can see the detail on the arms.

'I am purposely smiling big and making my eyes look crazy because these are crazy sweaters. I'm not terrified, I promise.'

Ms Rottum, who is willing to ship her incredibly hideous jumpers all over the world, also does commissions, and has even made a sweater for an British girl that is covered in skunks.
