It's perhaps no surprise that Yaya Toure wants to have his cake and eat it when the man pulling the strings is his long-time representative and mentor Dimitry Seluk.

Those who have become used to Seluk’s bizarre utterances over the years will not have been shocked by the latest outburst in which he accused Manchester City of snubbing his famous client’s 31st birthday.

The Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala once bought Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos a £800,000 Bugatti car, he noted. All Yaya got was two birthday cakes.

Influential: Agent Dimitry Seluk is the man driving Yaya Toure's latest outburst at Manchester City

Return? Seluk engineered Toure's move from Barcelona but the midfielder is keen on a return to the Nou Camp

Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano, City’s director of football and chief executive, have certainly seen it all before during their time at Barcelona when Seluk was forever sniping over the club’s reluctance to give Toure a better deal or more playing time.

Then coach Pep Guardiola became so exasperated by Seluk’s verbal incontinence that he confronted the player and demanded to know how he could respect Toure when his agent spoke without restraint so frequently. The issue is understood to have convinced Barca to sell Toure 12 months before he joined City for £24million. Even then, Seluk hardly helped the deal to go through.

‘City talk a lot, but when they put their offer in writing, they don’t look like a rich club, but a bankrupt one,’ he said.

After Toure helped his new club win the Premier League title in 2012, Seluk claimed that he might have to leave because he needed ‘new motivations’. Last year he got the Ivory Coast star a lucrative new deal after they claimed there were too few shirts bearing his name on sale in the club shop. Now this.

So who is the eccentric Ukrainian agent who has forged such a strong bond with Toure over the years that the player named his second child after him? 

A picture of Seluk on his Facebook page 
shows the agent relaxing in Monaco, where he is now  based, in front of a
 billboard for Chopard, an exclusive brand of Swiss wristwatches and 
jewellery. It is a fitting image.

‘I like my players more than I like money,’ Seluk said recently, but he has certainly become a rich man off Toure’s success and stands to make even more if he can engineer one more big transfer before Toure retires.

They first got together when Toure left Ivory Coast to join Belgian club KSK Beveren in 2001. Such was Seluk’s hold over the player that Yaya ignored advice from his own brother Kolo to join Ukrainian team Metalurh Donetsk. From there it was on to Olympiacos, Monaco and then Barcelona.

‘Yaya trusts me 100 per cent,’ said Seluk. ‘When he was young, I put him in more difficult situations so he had to grow and have a stronger personality. That paid off for him.’

And for Seluk as well. ‘This guy says one thing one day and another thing on the other,’ Toure once remarked. City just wish he would say nothing at all.
