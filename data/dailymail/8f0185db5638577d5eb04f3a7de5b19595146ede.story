Teenagers who use cannabis regularly risk damaging their memory, scientists say – in turn leading to poor academic performance.

They believe the brain abnormalities last for ‘at least a few years’ after users have stopped taking the drug.

The researchers also said there was fresh evidence the habit may cause mental health problems in youngsters predisposed to schizophrenia.

Researchers found that the steroid hormone pregnenolone reduces the brain's sensitivity to THC, which is the chief high-inducing compound in cannabis

Marijuana is the most commonly used 
illicit drug among adolescents in the UK, with more than four in ten 
admitting having taken it.

Almost 100 teenagers took part in the US research examining the effects of cannabis deep in the brain.

It
 found teenagers who smoked it daily for about three years had abnormal 
changes in the brain structures related to remembering and processing 
information and they performed poorly on memory tasks.

The
 brain abnormalities and memory problems were found on MRI scans when 
study participants were in their early twenties – two years after they 
had stopped smoking the drug.

Memory-related
 structures in their brains appeared to shrink and collapse inward and 
the researchers said such damage was linked to poor academic performance
 and everyday functioning.

The study also shows the marijuana-related brain abnormalities look similar  to those seen in schizophrenia patients.

Lead
 author Matthew Smith, a professor in psychiatry and behavioural 
sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 
Chicago, said: ‘The study links the chronic use of marijuana to these 
concerning brain abnormalities that appear to last for at least a few 
years after people stop using it.

‘With the movement to decriminalise marijuana, we need more research to understand its effect on the brain.’

A naturally occurring hormone called pregnenolone  can be used to stop the 'high' produced by cannabis and the discovery could lead to new approaches to treating cannabis intoxication and dependence, according to new research

He said chronic cannabis use may lead to changes in brain structure associated with having schizophrenia.

Of
 the 15 marijuana smokers who had schizophrenia in the study, 90 per 
cent had started using the drug heavily before they developed the mental
 disorder.

A recent study found teenagers who use cannabis regularly risk damaging their memory as structures in their brains appeared to shrink and collapse inward, possibly reflecting a decrease in neurons

Professor Smith 
added: ‘If someone has a family history of schizophrenia, they are 
increasing their risk of developing schizophrenia if they abuse 
marijuana.

‘If you have 
schizophrenia and you frequently smoke marijuana, you may be at an 
increased risk for poor working memory, which predicts your everyday 
functioning.’

The study, 
published in the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin, is the first to target 
key brain regions in the deep grey matter of chronic marijuana users 
with MRI scanning.

It is 
also the first time abnormalities in these regions have been linked with
 an impaired working memory – the ability to remember and process 
information in the moment and then transfer it to long-term memory.

Participants
 started using marijuana daily aged 16-17 for about three years – and 
had been free of the drug for around two years at the time of the study.

The 97 teenagers who took part included healthy people, those with a marijuana use disorder and schizophrenia patients.

The
 younger the individuals were when they started chronically using 
marijuana, the more abnormally their brain regions were shaped, 
suggesting parts related to memory are more susceptible to the effects 
of the drug if abuse starts at an earlier age.

Under
 the Labour government cannabis was downgraded from class B to class C 
in 2004, which critics argued gave the ‘green light’ to use by 
youngsters.

The decision was reversed in 2008 when ministers decided to overturn official scientific advice and return it to class B.

The younger the users, the more abnormally their 
brains were shaped

However, the abnormalities could have existed before they used cannabis
