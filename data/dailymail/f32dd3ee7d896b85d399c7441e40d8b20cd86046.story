Broadchurch fans were left shocked last night after the programme aired a lesbian kiss between middle-aged women - who many viewers mistakenly thought were sisters.

The passionate embrace between lawyer Jocelyn Knight and newspaper editor Maggie Radcliffe, atmospherically staged on the programme's iconic cliff top, was clearly meant to cause a stir among the 5.7million viewers.

But fans appeared to be taken aback, with many under the impression that the two characters  were related.

Sisters? Broadchurch viewers were left baffled last night when lawyer Jocelyn Knight and newspaper editor Maggie Radcliffe shared a romantic kiss during a cliff-top picnic - despite many thinking they were related

The pair had been portrayed as friends throughout the series after Radcliffe, who is played by Carolyn Pickles, convinced Knight to take on the show's central case, the murder trial of Joe Miller.

There had also been brief references made by Knight, played by Charlotte Rampling, about feelings for someone in her past - with no indication that the person was Radcliffe.  

But the kiss came after Knight arranged the romantic picnic and confessed her undying love for her close friend. 

She said: 'There was a moment, must have been 15 years ago, I should have said it then and I didn't. I'm in love with you Maggie.'

When Radcliffe replied that the revelation was too late, Knight takes matters into own hands and leaned in for the kiss. 

As is par for the course with this series of Broadchurch, it was just a matter of minutes before viewers were sharing their disbelief on Twitter.

One person tweeted: 'Biggest shock of my life this week on Broadchurch I thought Maggie and Jocelyn were sisters', while another added: 'I thought them women were related?!' 

A third fan wrote: 'Literally thought Jocelyn and that journo were sisters. Massive plot twist for me!', while another viewer said: 'That lesbian kiss. We all thought they were sisters.' 

Even those who were better informed about the characters' relationship were still left baffled, unsure why the kiss had only happened in the penultimate episode of the second series.

One viewer wrote: 'That lesbian kiss i have just seen on broadchurch is one of the strangest things i have ever seen.' 

The interaction sparked a flurry of comments on Twitter, with one saying: 'Biggest shock of my life this week on Broadchurch I thought Maggie and Jocelyn were sisters'

Another wrote: 'Run out of plot ideas? Throw in an attempted drowning and a lesbian kiss. Writing tips via #Broadchurch.' 

Even Philip Schofield felt he needed to vent his frustration, simply tweeting 'Aaaaaaaaarrghhhh!!!! #Broadchurch'. 

The second series of the ITV cult show has already divided opinions between viewers, with many criticising legal inaccuracies during the trial. 

Last week, viewers were shocked to see a 'Fifty Shades of Grey' scene in which Lee Ashworth is seen 'strangling' his wife Claire.

The pair's encounter took place outside in the ruins of a barn on the cliff tops where Ashworth is living.

Fans also complained that they were finding it harder to understand David Tennant - because his accent has become 'more Scottish'.

The actor, who plays dour Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, received wide-spread praise for his performance in the first series of the acclaimed show.

But a number of viewers have complained that they are finding it increasingly difficult to understand his accent ever since the second series got underway. 

Viewers also accused scriptwriters of adding in an unrealistic scene in last week's episode - table service from Nando's.

Elsewhere, mother Beth Latimer, played by Jodie Whittaker, prompted ridicule when she returned to court to witness the trial of Joe Miller a short time after an easy water birth. 

Viewers accused Broadchurch of going 'Fifty Shades of Grey' following this charged scene between Lee Ashworth and Claire on last week's show

Meanwhile, a scene showing David Tennant being given table service at Nando's also sparked outrage 

Viewers also criticised the fact that Beth Latimer (pictured) had returned to court to witness Joe Miller's trial just after giving birth 

Last night's viewing figure was at 5.8million, a huge slump from the initial 7.3million who tuned in for the first episode of the second series.

The criticism has led to Tennant to jump to the show's defence, saying the second series of the show is a victim of its own success.

He said: 'I think we're a victim of our success to be honest. The first series was such an extraordinary thing. This country, we never allow lightning to strike twice in this country...we just don't let that happen.

'So, inevitably there was going to be a certain amount of "it's not as good as the first time".

'I think it is. I think it's a wonderful series that I'm very proud to be part of.'The revelation was made as the pair enjoyed a wine fuelled picnic atop a cliff top – as you do.'

The series finale is due to be aired next Monday.
