Give the dog a board!

They're not known for their love of extreme sports, but these precious pooches were happy to shoot the curl at the fifth annual Surf City Surf Dog competition at Huntington Beach, California, today.

While some of the four-legged participants needed a bit of encouragement to hit the ocean, quite a few caught a good wave and rode the surf.

The pups competed against dogs their own size in four weight categories, from small hounds weighing under 20lb to extra-large canines weighing in at more than 60lb.

There was even a popular tandem category where owners could surf with their pet, or two dogs could surf together.
