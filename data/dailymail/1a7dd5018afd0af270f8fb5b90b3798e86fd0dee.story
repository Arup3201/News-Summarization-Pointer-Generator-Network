Derek Jeter does not seem to be a big fan of taking time off.

Just days after the New York Yankees shortstop retired from baseball after a storied 20 season career, he has announced a new venture that will deliver athletes' 'unfiltered' views to fans via a new website. 

The Players' Tribune is being billed as a digital company that will offer unique access to top athletes in every sport - from videos to photos to podcasts and more - without having to deal with reporters to do it.

Saying goodbye: Derek Jeter (above) has announced he is launching a new website just days after retiring from baseball

Direct line: The Players' Tribune (above) will let athletes speak directly with fans rather than through reporters or the media

In a statement on the site that posted today, Jeter said he wants the site to 'transform how athletes and newsmakers share information, and bring fans closer than ever to the games they love.'

Jeter - who has long been vague and guarded with reporters - attributed his success in what he called 'the toughest media market' to being careful about what he said.

'Those simple answers have always stemmed from a genuine concern that any statement, or opinion or detail, might be distorted,' he wrote  on the site.

But he said fans deserve to hear more from their fans than 'no comments,' and his site will allow a direct connection to the athlete.

'We just need to be sure our thoughts will come across the way we intend,' he wrote. 

The site's next big reveal will happen on October 2 Jeter announced.

There have also been whispers that perennial bachelor Jeter may be getting ready to settle down and start a family with model girlfriend Hannah Davis now that he has retired from the game.

Davis was in Boston over the weekend to cheer Jeter on during his final series against the Red Sox, and has been living with him in his West Village townhouse in New York City.

Jeter, as per usual, has not commented on these rumors.
