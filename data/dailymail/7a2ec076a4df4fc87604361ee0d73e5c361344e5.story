A 200-pound sculpture of a pink bulldog has been reported missing in West Hollywood following last weekend’s gay pride parade.

The hard-to-miss sculpture of a bulldog wearing sneakers on its front paws and a water bottle on its back is the work of Belgian artist William Sweetlove.

Six of his bulldog sculptures – three pink, three red - were placed on the Santa Monica Boulevard median strip last week ahead of Sunday's parade.

The pink pooch was stolen early Monday and authorities believe someone attending the festivities may have taken it as a memento.

Organizers have declined to estimate the value of the statue.

‘We don't want to encourage anybody to steal the other five,’ Andrew Campbell of the West Hollywood Economic Development Division told the L.A. Times.

Belgian artist William Sweetlove is offering a frog statue worth $1,600 as a reward to the person who leads authorities to his missing pink bulldog

‘Maybe somebody didn't realize they were stealing artwork.’

Sweetlove is so eager to have his sculpture returned that he is offering a frog statue worth $1,600 as a reward to the person who leads authorities to the bulldog.

The sculptures carry an ecological message, the dogs are wearing shoes and carrying drinking water in preparation for impending changes to our climate.

The boulevard installation is scheduled to remain in place until the end of September.
