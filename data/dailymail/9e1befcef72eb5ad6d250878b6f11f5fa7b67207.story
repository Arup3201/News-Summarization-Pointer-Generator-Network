A fantastic new Bel Air mansion has revealed a return to a trend of vast homes for the super rich - with some quirky added extras.

Chateau Des Fleurs is a 60,000-square-foot giant in Bel Air spread over ten acres and is valued at $100million.

It took more than five years to build it based on a classic French chateau style and includes such luxury amenities as a catering kitchen, a squash court and a salon.

The fabulous home hits the market as part of a new trend by property developers to create a string of outrageous features including botox rooms in a bid to lure in wealthy buyers.

Architects are creating special rooms where A-listers can get the cosmetic treatment in the hope it will persuade them to pay tens of millions of dollars for the mansions.

They are also including moats with bridges over them on the properties so that owners can feel like they are apart from the regular joes.

One even has its own Intensive Care Unit that is behind a secret panel so that doctors can treat patients on site.

The thinking is that the property owner - a wealthy and powerful businessman - is so important that if they were rushed to hospital the stock market would nosedive.

The mega rich have long desired more extravagant features for their homes than the next person, but according to the Los Angeles Times, things have become even more ridiculous of late.

Designer Steve Hermann, who is based in Beverly Hills and has worked on homes for the likes of Christina Aguilera, said that he included the botox room in a $65m mansion that does not even have a buyer yet.

The estate also includes another room with a dental chair so they can have their teeth whitened or touched up without going out the front door.

Mr Hermann said: ‘The developer is trying to come up with something to set his house apart.

‘It remains to be seen if the buyer will actually use the amenities.’

Mr Hermann also built a home in Montecito, which sold in October for $12.9 million with the 3,000 wine cellar in a temperature-controlled space on one wall on the same level as the kitchen, effectively making it a gallery to show off during parties.

He said: ‘People spend an infinite amount of money on wine. Why would you want it two floors underneath where you are?

‘They become like actual display rooms. Guests will come over and you'll show off your closets.’

Other homes in Malibu, which is home to dozens of celebrities, include ‘wellness suites’ so anyone from masseuses to hairdressers can treat celebrities in the comfort of their own homes.

Some have walk in safes or garages that look like showrooms, complete with wall panels and carpets.

Among those to have a moat installed was Jennifer Lopez, whose former $10m home in Bel-Air, California, had a waterway round the entire French-inspired villa.

In Brentwood, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and supermodel Gisele Bundchen also had a moat at their sprawling estate.

Kenneth Bordewick, who runs his own design group in Beverly Hills, has created a $17-million hand-carved bathroom and a poker room with jewels built in to the table.

He also designed the home with the on-site ICU which can be used for the doctor to treat the patient on site, or for staff to administer care and the doctor advises on the phone.

Mr Bordewick said: ‘If the owner goes to the hospital, the stock market could crash and a company may flounder’.

Celebrities have long gone for excess when it comes to their homes.

John Travolta added a runway next to his $4m mansion in Ocala, Florida, so that he could store the planes that he flies there.

Jerry Seinfeld has a $32m estate on the ocean in East Hampton, New York, which includes a 22 car garage and a full size basketball court.

And Celine Dion is still trying to sell her French Normandy-style, four-story chateau in Gagnon, Quebec, for $29.5m, complete with furnishings and artwork.
