A police officer who was served a McDonald’s burger with a raw beef patty at a drive-through in Derry, New Hampshire says it was ‘deliberate’ because he is a cop.

Rob Moore ordered the double quarter pounder with cheese at midnight at the fast food restaurant recently, which is the only place open when he works the night shift.

He says the restaurant was empty and that he drove through in full uniform.

When he was given his order, he dug in and took four quick bites out of it before realising that something was not quite right.

Disgusting: The officer was served this burger with a raw beef patty at a McDonald's in Derry, New Hampshire. He managed to take four bites before realising what he was eating

'Deliberate': Police officer Rob Moore believes the fast food staff gave him the raw burger on purpose because he is a cop

Routine: Moore ordered a double quarter-pounder with cheese at the McDonald's, something he does a couple times a week during his late shift

‘I took the bun off and the first patty was cooked, the second patty revealed a raw mess and I’m sitting there holding that. I couldn’t believe what I just ate,’ Moore told CBS Boston.

The beef patty was completely raw, he says, which he believes was done on purpose because he is a police officer.

‘A lot of people don’t like police officers, all the circumstances are there. Only one there in full uniform and it was obviously cooked after I arrived.’

Shock: The McDonald's drive-through in Derry served Moore a raw burger. He was expecting a well-cooked double quarter-pounder with cheese

Sick: Moore says he went home and vomited all night long after he ate the raw meat

It was at a McDonald's drive-through in Derry, New Hampshire, that the police officer was given a raw burger

Moore admits he went home and became violently sick and vomited all night long.

According to Moore, a surveillance video shows the cook preparing his order and not being able to close the cooker properly. The cook eventually gives up and slaps the raw meat onto the bun.

A statement from the Derry McDonald’s owner and operator, Emile Haddad, said they were looking into the incident.

‘We take matters regarding food safety and quality very seriously. We have investigated the issue and have resolved the customer’s concern at the restaurant level,’ said the statement.
