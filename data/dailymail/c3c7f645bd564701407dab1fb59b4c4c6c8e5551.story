The family of one of four young men who died installing roof insulation is considering suing the federal government over Labor's botched home insulation scheme.   

Mitchell Sweeney, 22, was electrocuted when working in a roof in a house at Millaa Millaa, in far north Queensland in early 2010.

A royal commission into the former Rudd Labor government's scheme delivered its findings on Monday, saying it was a fatally flawed program that was rushed out and sacrificed planning for speed in a scramble to boost the economy.

Mitchell Scott Sweeney, 22, was the fourth person to die in the insulation scheme. He was electrocuted on February 2, 2010. His mum Wendy (pictured) and his family  say government 'should pay for its mistakes'

The Federal Government established the inquiry soon after Tony Abbott became Prime Minister. 

It has cost $16 million and taken eight months to complete. 

Commission head Ian Hanger, QC, found the deaths of installers Mitchell Sweeney, Matthew Fuller, Rueben Barnes and Marcus Wilson were all avoidable.

Matthew Fuller was the first victim of The Labor Government's insulation scheme. His dad Kevin Fuller told the inquiry the the fight for justice had 'consumed' his life

Lawyer Peter Koutsoukis has told ABC radio the Sweeney family is already suing Mitchell's employer, Titan Insulations, and that the government should also pay for its mistakes.

'We will, as a result of these findings, be considering adding the government as a defendant to the litigation we are pursuing on behalf of the Sweeney family,' he said.

But he suggested families should not be forced to go through the courts.

Marcus Wilson died installing insulation bats in Sydney suburb St Clair in NSW  

'We were also hoping that there would be some recommendation for compensation ... that's not in the report. 

'But it's quite clear from the report that the government is liable so we do call on the government to compensate the families.'

About 120 insulation companies that purportedly lost around $200 million when the scheme was axed have also joined a class action seeking compensation.

'Our clients had no choice to participate (in the scheme) ... after all how could you sell insulation when the government is giving it away for free?' lawyer Mark Farrell told ABC radio.

The Australian Council of Trade Unions said the royal commission's recommendations to improve industry safety don't go far enough and has called on the government to further tighten regulations by introducing new protective legislation.

'The ACTU had hoped the royal commission would recommend the introduction of industrial manslaughter laws which have the potential to change community attitudes around criminally reckless negligence at work and ultimately reduce workplace deaths,' ACTU assistant secretary Michael Borowick said. 

Mr Abbott said the failures arose from 'a dysfunctional culture'. 

'The government will carefully consider the findings and the recommendations of this report, which is a timely reminder of what can happen if government acts with undue haste,' Mr Abbott said.

'The government's response will focus on ensuring that such a catastrophic policy failure never happens again,' Mr Abbott added.

The inquiry was told of serious program flaws, limited training for workers and a lack of system of checks. 

In May, former prime minister Kevin Rudd told the commission he accepted ultimate responsibility for the program's failings.

Former Labor environment minister Peter Garrett, parliamentary secretary Mark Arbib and numerous public servants all had duties to monitor certain issues, Mr Rudd said, although he did not directly implicate anyone. 

The inquiry started soon after Tony Abbott became Prime Minister and lasted eight months

Former Labor environment minister Peter Garrett, parliamentary secretary Mark Arbib and numerous public servants all had duties to monitor certain issues, Mr Rudd said, although he did not directly implicate anyone. 

During his testimony, Mr Garrett said he accepted ultimate responsibility, as the person charged with rolling out the scheme. 

'We share responsibilities with those other institutions that equally have them, such as state regulatory bodies, employers, ultimately employees as well,' Mr Garrett told the Commission.

But he too said others should share the blame.

The roles of both former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (left) and his former Environment Minister Peter Garrett (right) in the Home Insulation Program, came under close scrutiny during the eight-month Royal Commission

On 29 March, Royal Commissioner Ian Hanger QC made a request for additional time to produce his report into the Home Insulation Program.

October 14, 2009: Matthew Fuller, 25, is electrocuted laying insulation sheeting in the ceiling cavity of a house in Meadowbrook (Qld). He had started work with company 12 days earlier.

November 18, 2009: Rueben Barnes, 16, electrocuted laying batts in the ceiling cavity of a house at Stanwell (Qld). He had started with the company 21 days earlier.

November 21, 2009: Marcus Wilson, 19, dies from hyperthermia complications after installing batts in a St Clair (NSW) home in 40C heat.

February 4, 2010: Mitchell Sweeney, 22, is electrocuted laying insulation sheeting in the ceiling cavity of a home at Millaa Millaa (Qld). He had started at a new company a week earlier.

The Royal Commission stated that 'this additional two months will enable Commissioner Hanger to thoroughly consider the large volume of evidence that has been received'.

Since it was established on 12 December last year, the Royal Commission held 37 days of public hearings, where it heard from more than 50 witnesses, undertook over 120 interviews and issued 125 summons to produce documents.

The Royal Commission also received 70,000 relevant documents in response to summonses, and further documents are still being received by the Commission.

AAP reports that the inquiry heard former prime minister Kevin Rudd and his former minister Peter Garrett accepted 'ultimate responsibility' for the program, but said public servants failed to advise of safety risks.

Bureaucrats were warned five months before the program's roll-out that three New Zealanders had been electrocuted using metal staples to secure foil. After the first death, industry advice that foil should be banned wasn't heeded.

Senior bureaucrats said they were given two days to cost the scheme. Public servants believed the July 1, 2009 roll-out deadline denied them time to consider safety risks, but Mr Rudd said they should have asked for an extension.

Plans to train all installers were abandoned, allowing workers to enter roof cavities after undergoing a general safety induction provided they were supervised. But the government had no way of guaranteeing on-site supervision.

Mr Rudd controversially used details of secret cabinet proceedings to reveal that even after people started dying, bureaucrats advised the scheme was reportedly 'on track'.

The program had attracted so-called 'shonky' operators who failed to supervise inexperienced installers and claimed payments for work that had never taken place.

But the scheme's early termination also led to the financial ruin of established insulation companies, with some losing millions of dollars.
