Internet trolls fuelled by an ex police chief's claims about the McCanns incited conspiracy-theorists to plot to kidnap the couple's twins Sean and Amelie, a court heard today.

Goncalo Amaral's claims they faked daughter Madeleine's abduction to cover up her death in their Algarve holiday apartment was to blame for the threats, close family friend Michael Wright said.

Gerry and Kate McCann, 45, from Rothley, Leics, are suing the former Portuguese detective over his bombshell July 2008 book 'The Truth of the Lie.'

Defamed? Kate McCann, pictured speaking to press outside Lisbon's civil court last week, has brought a case of libel against the former police chief in the country who she says launched a 'smear campaign' against her

The couple have also launched £1 million libel proceedings at Lisbon's Palace of Justice against Mr Amaral's book publishers and a TV station which broadcast an April 2009 documentary based on his claims.

Mr Wright, husband of Kate McCann's cousin Anne-Marie, told the court the theories in Mr Amaral's book gave conspiracy theorists on anti-Mccann Internet forums 'focus' because he had been in charge of the botched investigation into Madeleine's disappearance.

He said: 'There were several examples of them inciting forum members to abduct one of the twins as they felt they would be able to throw some light on what may have happened.

'On one of the Internet forums, called The 3 Arguidos, there was an Internet conversation in great length where a member was suggesting that someone should abduct Sean or Amelie because they may be able to get information out of them that would confirm Mr Amaral's theories.'

Mr Wright, who helped monitor Internet activity on missing Madeleine for the couple, said he felt compelled to tell Gerry and he was interviewed by police from his home county of North Yorkshire after they decided detectives should be alerted.

He said the threats also made Gerry and Kate more vigilant about the use of the Internet by their twins, now eight.

 a lack of evidence

'I know Amelie has Googled her name and discovered sites to do with the conclusions of Mr Amaral's book,' he told the court.

'I do not know if she opened any of the pages and fortunately she told Gerry and Kate.

'But I know they will definitely be in a position where over the coming years they will search on the Internet and they will find people who will be saying their parents killed their sister.'

Mr Amaral's book was published just three days after the McCanns - made suspects over their daughter's death in September 2007 - had their status as 'arguidos' formally lifted.

Around 120,000 copies of the book were sold before it was withdrawn when the McCanns won an injunction against him.

It formed the basis for a documentary screened on TVI - the Portuguese equivalent of ITV - in April 2009.

Company director Mr Wright, from Skipton, North Yorks, said Gerry had suffered one of his darkest hours when they marked the second anniversary of Madeleine's May 3 2007 disappearance together in a remote cottage.

The couple were told on the way to the cottage locals on the Algarve were ripping up posters they had put up as part of a campaign to find their daughter.

He told the court: 'I had a discussion with Gerry where he talked about not being able to go on.

'I had never heard Gerry speak like that before.

'It was a very upsetting conversation for me to hear Gerry talk like that.

'Both he and Kate are incredibly strong and driven people.'

He said Kate, who flew to Lisbon last week for the start of the libel trial, changed whenever she was in Portugal where she felt most people believed Mr Amaral's theories.

'She feels she can't be seen to smile,' he told the court.

'Almost any form of relaxation is a problem, she wouldn't even go to the gym on her own, because there's still a belief most people in Portugal think she and Gerry are responsible for killing Madeleine.

'What is normal behaviour for her at home is very different when she is in Portugal.'

Revealing he had received an email informing him Mr Amaral had asked for £67,000 for an interview with Channel 5 in September 2009, he added: 'Kate's reaction was this was confirmation this was not about justice or truth.

'This was about greed.' Amaral, 56, is denying defamation.

He insists everything he published in his book is already contained in police and court case files on Madeleine which have been made public - an argument disputed by the McCanns.

The case, due to finish hearing evidence in November, continues next Friday.

It is believed Kate's mother Susan Healy, cousin Michael Corner and Gerry's sister Bridget Cameron, known as Trish, will be called as witnesses.
