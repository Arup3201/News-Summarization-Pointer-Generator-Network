Brian Thexton, 37, from Durham, was allegedly spotted in Lancashire yesterday driving a white Vauxhall

A fugitive thought to be hiding in Spain has been seen in the north of England, it was alleged today.

It is claimed that Brian Thexton, 37, was seen in a white Vauxhall Insignia at around 9am yesterday in Lancaster, Lancashire.

It is alleged that Thexton was involved in a series of robberies where homeowners would be tied up and forced to disclose alarm codes and safe combinations.

An officer then walked over to the car to speak to the driver and reached into the vehicle to remove the keys from the ignition, a Lancashire Police spokesman said.

'At this point the car was driven away, trapping the officer's arm and dragging him a short distance down the road.

'Fortunately, the officer freed himself before he was seriously injured. The car was then driven away at speed, mounting the kerb, narrowly missing pedestrians,' they added.

It was found a short time later having been set on fire on Fernham Carr Lane.

Detective Inspector Bev Foster said: 'Following the incident, we have set up a team of officers dedicated to tracking this person down and we are liaising with a number of other forces across England as well as the National Crime Agency.

'We are particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity on Fernham Carr Lane, or perhaps may have seen the vehicle being abandoned to get in touch as soon as possible.

'This man has shown himself to be dangerous and to have very little regard for his actions and so we would ask the public to be vigilant and not to approach him but report any sightings to the police immediately - any details the public may have could be crucial.

Robert Mortby, 26, is sought by police on suspicion of attempted murder over an attack on a man outside a pub in Elephant and Castle, south London.

Keith Turner, 60, from Northumbria (pictured, left, in his early 40s and, right, in an artist's impression of him aged 57) is sought by police for four offences of obtaining property by deception. He was released on licence in 1993 after serving 20 years in jail for the manslaughter of his mother and sister

'If anyone thinks they have seen him or if they have any information at all, then I would urge them to come forward and contact us.'

Thexton is on a list issued on Thursday of 13 of Britain's most wanted criminals thought to be hiding in Spain.

He is accused of being involved in robberies where a gang would tie up homeowners and force them to give up alarm codes and safe combinations.

In one the gang impersonated police 
officers to dupe the victims into opening the door, before brandishing a
pick axe handle and a baseball bat.

Daniel Bowes, 43, from London, was allegedly a senior figure in a cocaine smuggling ring, acting as a go-between for the head of the gang with contacts and delivery drivers. He is wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine

He is also awaiting trial for conspiracy to supply cocaine, over claims that he was the middleman in the sale of half a kilo of the drug, and had admitted conspiring to steal cars and machinery.

The list was published as part of Operation Captura, a scheme to trace criminals who are thought to have fled to Spain.

Other individuals on the list include Robert Mortby, 26, from London, who is suspected of the attempted murder of a man shot outside a pub in South London in July last year.

Ian Stanton, 42, from Liverpool, is the suspected leader of a Â£90million cocaine smuggling ring which brought in more than 400kg of the drug to the UK hidden in a shipment of beef in May.

Michael McCartney, 78, is thought to have spent eight months in hiding on Costa Del Crime. He was found guilty of sexually assaulting three boys and was arrested in Spain hours after the most wanted list was released

Mealey, 37, both from London, are alleged to be part of a gang importing
cocaine from the Netherlands between March 2011 and January 2012.

Serbian Daniel Dugic, 32, is accused of organising a drug smuggling operation involving 255kg of cocaine.

Lee Willis, 30, from 
Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty in March to 
possession of cocaine and possession of cannabis with intent to supply 
but went on the run after being given bail.
