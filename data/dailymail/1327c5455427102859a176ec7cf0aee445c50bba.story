A Chinese actress ruffled a few feathers when she invited Prince William to try the local delicacy - duck necks.

Wu Qian met the Duke of Cambridge at the premier of Paddington in Shanghai during his recent visit to China, the People's Daily reported.

The Chinese tv and film actress, who stars in the box office smash, was asking William how he had enjoyed his trip when she mentioned the regional dish.

Quackers: Chinese actress Wu Qian suggested Prince William tried the local delicacy of duck's neck when she met him in Shanghai during his recent visit

She recommended duck necks, which is a delicacy from Wuhan, provincial capital of Hubei, where she is from. 

It is not known if the Duke took Wu up on her culinary endorsement during his three-day trip.

But his foray to Asia left a lasting impression on Wu who said she spent days learning about British etiquette after learning she would meet the Prince.

Delicacy: Duck neck was recommended to Prince William during his recent visit to China

'Thinking back, talking about food at the first meeting is a bit strange,' she said. 

Duck neck is a famous Wuhan delicacy which combines SzeChuan style chilli to that part of the bird.

Wu, who only found out she was meeting William three days before, traveled back to Wuhan  to choose her dress.

She picked a classic 'English-style' dress with hand-stitched flowers to ensure it was one-of-a-kind. 

'When I was told that I may be on the red carpet with the Prince I was really terrified. I am still new to the industry and it's my first time to such a big event, she said.

'I was the only female actor at the premier and Prince William asked me some questions about the acting.'
