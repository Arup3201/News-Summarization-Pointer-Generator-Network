An adorable orphaned wombat has formed a very special bond with her surrogate mum – who just happens to be a human.

The helpful wombat named Chloe, who is nine-months-old, follows her zoo keeper Evelyn Weston around Taronga Zoo’s grounds overlooking Sydney Harbour every day.

‘It’s a natural behaviour and something Chloe would be doing with her real mother if she’d survived,’ Evelyn said.

‘Wombats stay with their mothers for up to two years, walking by their side until they’re old enough to fend for themselves.’

The pair have been inseparable since Chloe came to the zoo three months ago after her mother was struck and killed by a car near Jenolan Caves, west of the Blue Mountains, in June.

Chloe stays by Evelyn’s side while she cleans out exhibits and prepares breakfast for the other animals during morning walks. She is fed by a bottle every five hours and has her own makeshift pouch.

Chloe's mum was killed by a car earlier this year and the joey was found in her pouch still alive

Her daily walks are part of her development before she can be safely released back into the wild.

Keepers at the zoo have also built the joey a home where she can dig burrows and forage for her own food.

‘She’s really learning how to be a wombat. Her paws are already toughening up and she’s quite happy digging about on her own,’ said Evelyn.

When the time comes for Chloe to be released back into the wild she will first be transferred to a wombat ‘halfway house’.

But Evelyn admitted she’ll be a little sad to lose her. ‘I’ve been doing this job for a long time, but it’s always hard to say goodbye. I like to think I’ve toughened up, but sometimes I’m still a wuss,’ she said.
