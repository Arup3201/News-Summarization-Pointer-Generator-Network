Mystery death: Michael Easton, 13, was found dead on a the M9 motorway on Saturday morning

The family of a teenager found dead on a motorway in Scotland have spoken of their devastating loss of their beloved son.

Michael Easton, 13, was discovered on the westbound carriageway of the M9, in the early hours of Saturday after he failed to turn up at his home the night before.

His family are now appealing to members of the public to solve the mystery of what happened to the 'quiet and well-loved' boy.

Michael was last seen at 9.50pm on Friday in Grangemouth town centre, Falkirk and had been expected to return to his home in nearby Polmont around the same time.

The police are looking for answers to what may have happened to Michael between that time and 5.40am when his lifeless body was found on the side of the motorway.

In a statement the family said: ‘We have all been left utterly devastated by the death of our beloved Michael and are still trying to come to terms with our loss.

‘Michael was a quiet and well-behaved boy, who never caused any trouble and who would have helped anybody. He loved his family deeply.

‘He was a popular young boy who had a keen interest in biking.

'One of his prized possessions was his scooter and he and his friends spent several hours each week riding around Grangemouth.

‘It is difficult not knowing exactly what happened to Michael and we would ask that anyone who knows anything that can help the police with their investigation to pick up the phone.'

The family added: ‘We would finally like to thank everyone for all of their kind words and messages of support at this very difficult time.

'It means a great deal to us all and shows how fond the local community was of Michael.

‘However, we would now ask our privacy be respected to grieve for our son, brother and friend.’

Michael was found between junction 5 and junction 6 of the M9 at 5.40am yesterday.

Anyone with information relating to this incident have been asked to contact Police Scotland on 101 or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
