European regulators have ordered Google to clarify its new privacy policy and make it easier for users to opt out of it.

France’s National Commission on 
Computing and Freedom led a European investigation into Google’s new 
unified policy, which replaced 60 individual policies for its search, email
 and other services and regulates how it uses the personal data it 
collects.

Today it said the US company had 'months' to make changes.

A double pronged attack: Google is expected to be told to 'unravel' the information pools on its users - as the US Federal Trade Commission is believed to be considering launching a massive antitrust suit

CNIL's president Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin said the company had 'three or four months' to make the revisions, otherwise 'authorities in several countries can take action against Google'.

Google responded that it is reviewing the commission’s report but that it believes its policy respects European law.

'We have received the report and are reviewing it now,' said Peter Fleischer, its global privacy counsel.

'Our new privacy policy demonstrates our long-standing commitment to protecting our users' information and creating great products.

'We are confident that our privacy notices respect European law.'

The commission said today that it has
 three main concerns about the policy: it’s not clear enough in 
explaining to users what data is collected and how it will be used; it’s
 too difficult for users to opt out of data collection; and Google 
doesn’t say how long it will hold onto data.

The concerns were made in a letter 
to the U.S. internet company, which was seen by Reuters.

The letter, which stopped short of 
declaring Google's approach to collecting user data illegal, follows an
 investigation led by France's Commission Nationale de l'Informatique 
(CNIL) that began in February.

Leading the inquiry on behalf of 
Europe, France's data protection watchdog had already questioned the 
legality and fairness of Google's new privacy policy, introduced in 
March.

The current row revolves around Google's decision to pool of anonymous user data across Google services.

For Google, this is a big advantage when selling online ads.

Google and other large internet 
groups like Facebook provide free services to consumers and earn money 
from selling ads that they say are more closely targeted than 
traditional TV or radio campaigns.

This consolidated 60 privacy policies into one and pooled data 
collected on individual users across its services, including YouTube, 
Gmail and its social network Google+.

Users cannot opt out.

The regulators' letter said: 'Combining personal data on such a large scale creates high risks to the privacy of users.'

'Therefore, Google should modify its 
practices when combining data across services for these purposes,' the 
letter said.

It was signed by 24 of EU's 27 data regulators plus those 
of Croatia and Liechtenstein.

In the past, the company has said the
 changes would allow it to tailor search results more accurately and 
improve services for consumers.

Google has also said previously it is 
confident that its privacy policy does not run foul of European law.

In the letter, the regulators listed 
12 'practical recommendations' for Google to bring its privacy policy 
into line.

The first five cover how Google tells people about how their 
personal information and browsing records will be used, highlighting 
location data and credit card data in particular.

The regulators also want Google to 
spell out its intentions and methods for combining data collected from 
its various services.

They want the web search giant to ask users for 
explicit consent when bundling data together, the letter said.

The pooling of anonymous user data across Google services, is a big advantage when selling online ads.

 The news comes as Federal regulators
 in the US are believed to be moving closer to suing Google over 
allegations that the company has abused its dominance of Internet search
 to stifle competition and drive up online advertising prices.

Several
 news outlets reported that staff members at the Federal Trade 
Commission are preparing to recommend that the agency file an antitrust 
lawsuit against the search giant.

A majority of the five FTC commissioners would have to approve a suit before legal action could proceed.

The reports from The New York Times, Bloomberg News and Reuters cited unnamed people briefed on the FTC's investigation.

FTC spokesman Peter Kaplan declined to comment.

The agency has been investigating Google's business practices.

The
 probe was triggered by complaints that Google Inc. has been 
highlighting its peripheral services in its influential search results 
and relegating offerings from its rivals to the back pages.

The
 FTC also has been looking into whether Google has rigged its results in
 a way that has prodded websites to pay more to promote their services 
through Google's advertising network.

In a statement Friday, Google said, 'We are happy to answer any questions that regulators have about our business.'

Google and other large internet 
groups like Facebook provide free services to consumers and earn money 
from selling ads that they say are more closely targeted than 
traditional TV or radio campaigns.

Chris Watson, a lawyer at CMS Cameron
 McKenna LLP, said: 'Google is being very aggressive and are playing for
 high stakes because these (privacy policy) changes are very valuable to
 their advertising business.

'They may be prepared to test the legal position in Europe to see what they can get away with.'

The tussle with the EU over data privacy comes at a delicate time for Google.

Europe's antitrust authorities are 
also examining the company's business model to see if it uses its clout 
in search advertising to favour its own services over competitors' 
offerings.

The firm has been in negotiations with the European Commission for several months solutions to its alleged anti-competitive behaviour by promoting its own products ahead of rivals' in search results.
