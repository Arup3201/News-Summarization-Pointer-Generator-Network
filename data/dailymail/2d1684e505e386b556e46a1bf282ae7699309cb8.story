This, ultimately, will be a day that Louis van Gaal wishes to forget but for Tyler Blackett, it will be a day that he will always remember.

Blackett, 20-years-old, made his Barclays Premier League debut for Manchester United on Saturday, producing an assured performance at the heart of the back four that belied his tender age.

A local boy, Blackett has been on United's books since the age of 8 and Saturday lunchtime marked the culmination of twelve years of dedication as he was handed a start by Louis van Gaal in the absence of Jonny Evans.

United disappointment: Blackett couldn't stop his side slumping to an opening defeat against Swansea

This defeat by Swansea City is likely to accelerate United's pursuit of defensive reinforcements but it would be wrong to single out Blackett for criticism, whose performance in the defence was arguably more polished than more senior men such as Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Ashley Young.

Blackett began the match with confidence, switching the ball 50 yards onto the toe of Jesse Lingard and his composure in possession proved to be one of the hallmarks of an impressive showing.

Blackett executed more passes than any of his team-mates - 90 in total - and also had the best accuracy, with 93.3% of his attempts successfully reaching a United player. He also won all three of his aerial duels.

A crunching tackle late on, perhaps out of frustration, earned him a yellow card but that was the only blot on his copybook in a remarkable individual showing at Old Trafford.

United are expected to seal the signature of Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon and would like to add Daley Blind from Ajax. That may stiffen the competition but in Blackett, Van Gaal will know that he possesses a young, English defender who could yet play a significant role this season.
