A gold medalist Canadian freestyle skier had only one person that he wanted to celebrate with after completing his near-perfect run in Sochi: his disabled brother.

Alex Bilodeau has spoken countless times about how he is so close with his brother Frederic, who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at a young age and told he would not be able to walk beyond the age of 12, yet more than 15 years later he is still able to do so.

When 26-year-old Alex made the final stop at the end of the mountain on Monday night, he immediately ran over to his brother and pulled him over the barrier so that they could celebrate together.

Together: As soon as he finished the run, Alex ran over to his brother and lifted him from behind the security barrier so that they could celebrate together

Shot to fame: Alex's first gold came in 2010 and his brother Frederic has become something of a celebrity in the disabled community in Canada because of the awareness he has raised

'Just like you or I, he has dreams and most of them are not realisable to him but he does dream about it, he talks about it and he never complains that it's not realistic to him,’ Alex said of his brother.

'Every day I feel very lucky to be a normal person that has the chance to go after his dreams, and he doesn't have that chance. So out of respect to him, I need to go after that and with his motivation he would be four-time Olympic champion.

'It's crazy the motivation that he takes and every step is very hard for him. In life, I have an easy path and I need to go out there and do the best I can just out of respect to him.

'He lives his dreams through me. (Two gold medals) is the least I can do, he's my every day inspiration.'

Big deal: Monday night¿s gold means that Bilodeau has become the first moguls skier with multiple Olympic medals as well as three world championship golds in dual moguls

Strong showing: Bilodeau won and his close competitor and fellow Canadian Mikael Kingsbury came in second while Russia's Alexandr Smyshlyaev came in third

Although Frederic briefly slipped over, his brother lifted him back onto his feet.

The freestyle skiing was a clean sweep for Bilodeau’s homeland, with two of the three top spots going to Canadians with his frequent competitor Mikael Kingsbury who came in second.

'When I'm on the hill (Kingsbury) is in my mind and he's pushing me to be a better skier, but outside of the hill, whether I'm in university or training or whatever I do in life, my brother is my every day inspiration,' Bilodeau said.

Monday night’s gold means that Bilodeau has become the first moguls skier with multiple Olympic medals as well as three world championship golds in dual moguls- though he was never able to become individual champion, settling twice for silver.

He previously announced that he would retire at the end of the World Cup season and predicted Kingsbury would take over his mantle once he's gone.

So happy: His girlfriend Sabrina Bizier also greeted him at the finish line

Heartwarming: The brotherly love between Alex and Frederic has added an emotional element to his story
