Peter Crouch’s manager won’t be worrying about whether his star player will be focused on the game tomorrow evening - Abbey Clancy’s pregnancy has put a stop to any late night shenanigans in their household.

The model has revealed she isn’t letting her husband anywhere near her because she has been suffering from severe morning sickness and her swelling body is painful to touch.

She told The Times: ‘One part of your brain is going, 'Oh my God, I'm so blessed, it's a miracle', and the other half is going, 'I can't bear this, I'm so fat, I'm ugly, I've got headaches, I've got spots, I feel sick.’

Abbey Clancy is five months pregnant with her second child and has been suffering from severe morning sickness for months. The model has revealed he has been gorging on junk food to ease the nausea

'Pete's not too happy with me moaning every two seconds (and) the perks — the big boobs and that — he can't go anywhere near because they're too painful.’

The only pro so far is her change in diet – the 29 year old has been loading up on carbohydrates in an effort to stem her constant nausea, which involves snacking on items including croissants, cream cheese bagels and muffins.

Abbey and Peter’s second child is due in April and the couple have decided to keep the sex a mystery until the birth.

The couple had hoped for a daughter the first time and were delighted with the arrival of Sofia in March 2011, but Abbey has revealed that they have no preference this time.

Abbey is hoping for a similar labour to her first child though after a problem-free six-hour delivery complete with epidural.

She said: ‘I had the most amazing birth, but my mum thinks I was completely cheating - she and all my aunties were like, that's not real birth! I said, 'How isn't it?' because she still came out the normal way.’

Abbey is similarly unconcerned about regaining her pre-pregnancy figure after the birth too, as her body is naturally slim.

She claims that her size six figure is achieved with little effort and she doesn’t even have an exercise regime, crediting good genes for her slim line silhouette.

Her own fitness is the only exercise she has no interest in – Abbey also pays little attention to her husband’s football games and claims she never watches him play on television because the game bores her.

Her younger brother Sean, 27, is a professional footballer for Telford United, so she was forced to attend matches as a child long before she met Peter.

But her association with the sport has done little to make her like it, in fact, it has had the opposite effect and she admits she actively dislikes football.

She said: ‘I am so proud watching my husband playing in front of all them people, but if it was on TV, I wouldn't sit and watch it.

‘(Peter) enjoys the fact that I don't know anything about football because everyone talks to him about it except me, so he'll score a hat-trick and come home and I'll be like, “So Pete, can you fix this, can you change that?”’
