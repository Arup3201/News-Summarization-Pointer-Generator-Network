A review of the Madeleine McCann case has been launched by police in Portugal.

Four years after the official inquiry into her disappearance was shelved, another squad of detectives has been told to examine the case files.

The McCann family’s Portuguese lawyer said the move could have been prompted by fresh information that warrants a further hunt for clues.

Fresh look: Portuguese police have set up a new team of detectives to review the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, pictured, it emerged today

The team, from the northern city of Oporto, has been instructed to go over the thousands of pages of case files to search for new leads.

The development will provide fresh hope for Maddie’s parents Gerry and Kate McCann, who have never given up hope of finding their daughter alive.

Mr and Mrs McCann have repeatedly called on the Portuguese authorities to resume the search for Maddie, who vanished just days before her fourth birthday in 2007.

The case review is being carried out by Policia Judiciaria’s Regional Section of Criminal Investigation and Prevention in Oporto, led by Helena Monteiro.

Optimistic: Kate and Gerry McCann hope that the new development will lead to the case into the disappearance of their daughter being reopened

Officers from the PJ are working with
 the Scotland Yard team set up in May last year to review the 
investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance.

That multimillion-pound review is not expected to conclude until the end of the year.

McCann family spokesman Clarence Mitchell said: ‘Kate and Gerry obviously welcome the work being done by the PJ in Oporto alongside that of the Met investigative team.

‘They clearly hope that it will lead to the case being reopened in due course. There is good co-operation between the Met and the PJ, and Kate and Gerry remain grateful  for the time and resources  that have been put into the search for Madeleine.

‘They will not be discussing any details whilst both the Met investigative review and the PJ work is continuing, but clearly it is a positive development.’ The McCanns’ Portuguese lawyer, Rogerio Alves, described the police case review as a ‘very positive sign’.

He said: ‘More than anything Kate and Gerry want to discover what happened to their daughter, whilst of course harbouring the hope of finding her alive.

‘For that to happen, the police need to carry on looking for her and carry on following the leads at their disposal.’

He also told a Portuguese TV station: ‘It’s not absolutely certain but what’s happening at the moment is that some of the information passed to the authorities could lead to a reopening of the case.

'I can’t go into any sort of detail 
and I hope people will understand me, but at this moment in time there 
is something that aroused enough interest from the Portuguese and 
British police to warrant this review in search of new clues.

‘This is all I can say but obviously 
the most plausible explanation for what’s happening is this one, that 
information passed to or acquired by the Judicial Police in Oporto has 
put them on the trail of something specific.’

Detectives from Oporto are understood to
 have travelled to the Algarve, where Maddie vanished on May 3, 2007, as
 part of the review.

She disappeared from a rented holiday apartment while her parents dined with friends a few yards away.

Attorney general Jose Pinto Monteiro archived the case in July 2008.

The Scotland Yard review, called Operation Grange, involves 30 murder squad detectives, some of whom have made at least four trips to Portugal and Spain.

Last December, it was reported that they were examining eight ‘important’ new leads.
