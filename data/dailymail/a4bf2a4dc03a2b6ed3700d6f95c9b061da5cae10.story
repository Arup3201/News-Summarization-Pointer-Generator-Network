A heroic 63-year-old Texas man with two surgically repaired knees came to the rescue of a young woman who was being mauled by pitbulls.

Monica Garza was literally being torn apart by two raging dogs as she jogged along a hiking trail behind Charles Jordan's Houston home on Wednesday morning.

His wife heard Garza's terrified screams and Jordan, who has to use a walking stick, hurried to help and jumped on-top of her - but not before the dogs had bitten their victim 56 times.

'I just kept kicking that dog and kicking that dog and it wasn't going to stop,' said Jordan about the unrelenting dogs. 'They were determined to get to that girl.'

'One had her by the arm and the other had her by the leg and they were just pulling her apart,' he said to ABC 13 in Houston.

The attack, which took place along the South Belt hike and bike trail, lasted for more than 10 minutes before the dogs tired and left.

'I’m fine. The dogs didn’t want me. They were fixated on her.'

'I said, 'You are safe. There is nothing else going to happen to you today.' She just put her head down and started crying and that is when I broke down, too,' said Jordan.

Garza was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery and one of the responding EMT's turned out to be a close family friend of the victim.

'I didn’t recognize she was wet and bloody,' said Miguel Cantu to KHOU. 'She recognized me and said, please help me.'

The dogs were tracked down and seized by animal control where they are to be quarantined for 10 days.

Authorities have questioned the owner of one of the dogs and are still trying to reach the owner of the other one. Both animals are facing termination.

First alarm: Sharon Jordan alerted her husband to the fact that Monica Garza was in serious difficulty with two ragin pitbulls

Charles's wife Sharon, who alerted him to the plight of Garza said that initially she thought she could hear an excited child.

'I thought it was some kid on the walking trail screaming as they rode their bike,' said Sharon Jordan to KHOU. 'It kept going and wouldn’t go away.'

Jordan denied he was a hero, but Garza's father, Jeff Mack disagreed.

'I firmly believe he saved her life by risking his,' said Jeff Mack.

Jordan, who is a grandfather, said he would risk his life again to do the same thing.

'She’s too young,' said Jordan. 'Young people don’t need to be hurt. I’ve got kids. I’ve got grand kids. Don’t hurt them.'
