CSKA Moscow says Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev should be ready to play this weekend after recovering from being hit in the head with a flare during a European Championship qualifying match against Montenegro.

A flare thrown from an area occupied by Montenegro fans hit Akinfeev in the back of the head during Friday's game. He was rushed to the hospital and treated for burns and a concussion.

The match was later abandoned following more crowd trouble. Midway through the second half a scuffle ensued between players near the touchline, with Eastern Europe's Sport Klub television reporting that a missile hurled from the terraces appeared to have hit another Russian player.

Akinfeev is carried off the pitch on a stretcher, which led to a 30 minute delay before game was called off

With the score at 0-0 in the Group G game, German referee Deniz Aytekin ordered the players back into the dressing room for the second time moments after Montenegro keeper Vukasin Poleksic saved a Roman Shirokov penalty.

Montenegro and Russia supporters clashed at halftime, forcing riot police to move in to separate them. Montenegrin daily Vijesti reported on its website.

Nonethless, CSKA assistant coach Viktor Onopko tells Russia's Tass agency that Akinfeev is expected to be back in training Tuesday and will "probably" be able to face Zenit St. Petersburg on Sunday.

Another CSKA player, Alan Dzagoev, will miss the Russian league match after injuring his thigh against Montenegro.
