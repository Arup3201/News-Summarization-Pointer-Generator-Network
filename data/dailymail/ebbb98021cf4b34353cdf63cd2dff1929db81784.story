Once upon a time an American family’s home was their castle and the bigger the better, but growing concerns about meeting mortgage payments and the environmental impact of large houses has helped fuel a new movement of people who are happy to live small.

The Tiny House Movement is a growing group of people who are happy to downsize the space that they live in and enjoy simplified lives as a result.

While the average American home is around 2600 square feet, the typical small or tiny house is around 100-400 square feet.

Buyers can be anyone from millennials and newlyweds who want to avoid the 30-year mortgage path to retirees who are downsizing and simplifying for a more carefree lifestyle

Large homes come at a cost and most Americans spent between 1/3 and 1/2 of their income on keeping a roof over their heads, as a result 76 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.

To escape the cycle of debt that increasing comes with the large house and the white picket fence, some people are attracted by the simplicity of the Tiny House Movement.

One company at the heart of the movement is the Tumbleweed Tiny House Company, which teaches workshops all over the country on how to build tiny homes.

The Sonoma, California, company also offer tiny house floor plans and build homes for people who want their ‘houses-to-go’ ready-made and delivered.

Buyers can be anyone from millennials and newlyweds who want to avoid the 30-year mortgage path to retirees who are downsizing and simplifying for a more carefree lifestyle.

There are also artists and musicians who want space, physically and financially, to practice their craft.

New to the market from Tumbleweed is the Cypress 24 model Tiny House, which provides enough space for four adults may sleep comfortably in the loft and the new downstairs bedroom.

Tiny houses can come in all shapes, sizes and are certainly not ramshackle shacks as people still want them to be livable and stylish and include regular toilets, showers, and kitchens.

Some people put the tiny homes in their backyards for a young college graduate or elderly parents, while the concept of 'tiny home communities' is also taking shape.
