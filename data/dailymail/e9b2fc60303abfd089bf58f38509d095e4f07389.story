The Million Women Study has found that women over 50 who are overweight or obese have a higher cost to the NHS due to increased admissions

Obesity caused by poor lifestyle choices such as diet are the cause of one in eight hospital admissions for women over 50-years-old, according to a new study.

Researchers from the University of Oxford found that hospital admissions for women over 50 are commonly caused by issues to do with obesity or being overweight, and that these issues accounted for around 2 million days in hospital a year.

The research was part of the Million Women Study, one of the biggest health research projects currently taking place in the UK.

Researchers found the information by looking at the diseases in women with a high body mass index (BMI) of more than 25, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

However, while these diseases are common with women over 50 who have a high BMI, the study found that most of the issues were to do with cancer.

Weight is one of the big risk factors for breast cancer, and is one of the few that can actually be altered.

This was explained by lead author of the study Gillian Reeves, who said: 'A lot of the work I do is related to cancer.

'A lot of the risk factors for breast cancer, in particular, you can't change.

'In some sense, it is quiet nice to think this is a modifiable risk 
factor – there is a lot to be gained by not putting on excess weight.'

The Million Women Study estimates that the annual bill to the taxpayer by overweight or obese women over 50 and their hospital visits is around £500 million, based on one NHS bed costing £250 a day.

The study looks at changes in health of the whole population over time, and has been running since 1996, looking at around a quarter of all the women in the UK aged between 50 and 64 - around 1.3 million women.

36 per cent of the 1.3 million participants were overweight, and around 18 per cent were obese, more than 54 per cent of the total women who participated, and a few per cent less than the official figure of women in England - 58 per cent.

The NHS may be spending more money on conditions related to obesity, like hip replacements and heart disease, due to the poor lifestyle choices commonly associated with being overweight

Some of the most common reasons for overweight women being admitted were cataract surgery (45,000 admissions) and gallbladder disease (35,000 admissions), followed by breast cancer (34,307 admissions) and heart disease (32,483 admissions).

The study found that weight was a big factor in both minor and major conditions.

Women with a BMI higher than 25 were at a big risk for diabetes (74 per cent of admissions) an knee replacements (66 per cent of admissions), and one in five heart attacks were because of weight.

Minor conditions included carpal tunnel syndrome (31 per cent of admissions in overweight people and 23 per cent in obese people), which cost the NHS a lot because they are common.

The study found the more weight women put on, the more likely they were to spend time in hospital.

Reeves told the Guardian: 'Previous reports may have under-estimated the effect of BMI.

'The increased risk is quiet steady.'

The study did not look at how much the cost of the increased admissions was to the NHS, but they do intend to study this as well, with estimates that conditions to do with weight are more costly to the NHS than others.

One peculiar aspect that the study found was that overweight women who had a BMI higher than 25 were less likely to smoke or drink, which meant that the majority of admissions with overweight women were due to conditions only related to being overweight rather than other factors.
