Overhaul: Education secretary Michael Gove suggested exams could be graded one to ten rather than by A* to C

GCSE grades could be ditched in favour of a number-based system, Michael Gove suggested yesterday.

The Education Secretary said the top grades of A* and A could be replaced by classifications ranging from one to four.

If this were applied all the way down to the lowest grade of G, pupils could end up with a score of between one and ten.

Mr Gove, who is overhauling GCSEs in 2015 by replacing modules with end of course exams, said the new system would help ‘re-fix the level at which people recognise outstanding attainment’.

If introduced, it would end the grading system that was first used for O-levels and A-levels in 1965.

Mr Gove was giving evidence at an education select committee hearing when he was asked how he would avoid a ‘collapse’ in the number of top grades as pupils and teachers adjusted to the new exams.

‘The plan that’s likely, though not definitive, is we’d change how exams are graded,’ he said.

‘So that, for the sake of argument... you might have 1,2,3,4 cover a band of achievement that’s currently A* and A.’

He denied planning to make it harder for pupils to get top marks after years of grade inflation, adding: ‘It’s not my explicit aim to reduce the number of people who receive a particular mark.

‘It’s my aim to ensure, working with [exam regulator] Ofqual, that people can reliably feel once you have new examinations that they will keep their standards over time.

‘You’re going to have new examinations and, I hope, a new approach moving on from where comparable outcomes were.’

Change: Mr Gove said he wants to overhaul GCSEs to 're-fix the level at which people recognise outstanding achievement'

However, there were doubts yesterday over whether Mr Gove’s proposal marked a genuine departure from the grades system.

Graham
 Stuart, the Conservative education select committee chairman, said the 
numbers would help make it clear a new system had been introduced but 
they were ‘not a fundamental change’. ‘Given nearly everyone at the top 
goes on to do A-levels you could say it doesn’t matter that much,’ he 
added.

Chris McGovern, of 
the Campaign for Real Education, said the plan was ‘overcomplicated and 
unnecessary’. ‘This is an example of exam currency being inflated,’ he 
said. ‘They should go for a percentage mark that is readily understood 
by parents, employers and children.’

The
 body operating Cambridge University’s three exam boards including OCR 
last week suggested a radical overhaul of GCSEs by replacing grades with
 scores that ‘could range from 600-900’.

Cambridge
 Assessment said this would remove the ‘arbitrary’ categories under 
which pupils with similar marks can end up with different grades or 
those with quite different marks receive the same grade.

An Ofqual spokesman said: ‘We will be consulting soon on arrangements for the new GCSEs, and this will include a range of proposals for how they should be graded.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We have consulted on a new accountability system for secondary schools and are considering how to change it.

‘The new more rigorous GCSEs will include more demanding assessment structures. Ofqual is considering how we can improve the current A* to G grading system. This is one option.’

Mr Gove also told MPs he still wanted to move away from tiering in GCSEs, where pupils can be entered for a foundation paper with a maximum C grade or a higher paper depending on their ability.
