'My name is Walter White and I am a meth cook. For ten years I had the best meth in Alabama.'

These are the words of the real-life Walter White from Bessemer, Alabama.

In 2008, even as the fictional Walter White first began to build his methamphetamine empire on AMC's hit show Breaking Bad, a real meth chef by the same name was arrested doing something almost identical in Alabama.

The real Walter White: In 2008, Walter White was building his meth empire in the AMC hit series Breaking Bad. That same year, Tuscaloosa County, Alabama's most successful meth cook was also making the purest meth east of the Mississippi

Experienced: Walter White had been making meth for ten years. He's so good that some say he should be called the 'meth chef'

Revealing: The meth cook exposes the secret of his legendary operation - he explained how he got started, how he made - and spent - thousands of dollars every day, how he got arrested and why his partners are now serving life sentences behind bars

From 1988, the drug maker who shares the same name with the main character in the ten-time Emmy award winning TV show was cooking and selling methamphetamine across his own county.

By 2009 the show was one of the most popular in the country and Alabama's real Walter White and the coincidental similarities between himself and the fictional kingpin on TV every Tuesday was big news.

In a video documentary with VICE online, White, 55, explained the ups and downs of his adventure into drugs.

Working with a partner, like Walter White in the show, he claims he made the purest meth around.

Real or fantasy? Bryan Cranston plays a mild-mannered chemistry teacher who becomes a drug baron to support his family after he discovers he has lung cancer

Parallels: The two Walter White's share a great deal in common, not least of which they were both making thousands of dollars a day trafficking and creating meth

White said that at the peak of his meth-making and drug-selling business, he was making several thousand dollars a day.

'I worked every day and was a family man. It was a good time in my life. It was beautiful. We started making meth part time at first but then demand got so  high i would work during the day and make meth at night,' White says.

'I was making money in construction but the meth money was outweighing it by so much I decided to go down that line.'

The fictional Walter White, played by Emmy-winner Bryan Cranston, is a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher who cooks meth and becomes a ruthless drug baron to help support his family after he's diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.

The show, created by Vince Gilligan, starred Cranston alongside Aaron Paul who plays a slackers former student of White, who team up to manufacture and distribute huge quantities of the drug in New Mexico.

Life imitating art: In real-life, Walter White was alerted to the fact the authorities were onto him and watching his every move. The same is true of the the Breaking Bad character

Recovering: White has since been sent to and graduated from a court-ordered long-term faith-based recovery program at the Foundry Rescue Mission & Recovery in Bessemer, Alabama

'The sky was the limit,' he said. 'I bought tools, four-wheelers, cars, trucks, you name it. I just stockpiled the money,' White said. 'When you make it like that, it's easy to spend, it's just a different lifestyle. Looking back now, it's hard to believe that I could go through that much money in one day.'

'When you make it like that, it's easy to spend, it's just a different lifestyle. Looking back now, it's hard to believe that I could go through that much money in one day. Several thousand, easy.'

He would drop the drop the drugs off at a certain spot and then come back the next day to a seculded spot in the countryside to pick up the cash.

Unlike Walter White in the show, played by actor Bryan Cranston, real-life White was not dying of cancer and was not chased by his own brother in-law.

But like in the show, it was not an easy ride.

On the run: In 2012, White violated his probation in Tuscaloosa County, failed to appear in court and was put on the top of most wanted list by the sheriff there

More money than sense: White was pulling thousands of dollars a day and spending the cash on tools and cars

Bearing all:  Walter was known for having the purest stuff in Alabama and has been speaking about his days in the game, his way of doing things, and of course, his thoughts on the hit AMC show, Breaking Bad

White's wife divorced him, as he began to lose touch with his family.

His oldest son describes feeling him drift away from the family because of the time he spent in the lab.

As in the show, his lawyer advised him to stop cooking meth because the authorities were investigating his activity in 2008.

His partner, Sammy, continued to work and was arrested by the police several times.

White later went back into making drugs in another county until he was finally arrested.

Family values: Walter White grew apart from his family including his son, Chris, (right) but now he says he is working to repair relationships - after all, they managed to survive without him

Thinking about the future: Walter White knows that he could go to jail for the rest of him life when he has his trial in March 2014 but he resigns himself to the fact he will no longer be hurting anyone but himself

White has since been sent to and graduated from a court-ordered long-term faith-based recovery program at the Foundry Rescue Mission & Recovery in Bessemer, Alabama.

White's family and his friends say he's a success story and has left the life of making and selling illegal drugs.

In 2012, White violated his probation in Tuscaloosa County, failed to appear in court and was put on the top of most wanted list by the sheriff there.

He was eventually caught and jailed with a $2 million bond placed on his release.

He was placed on the top of state's Most Wanted List and now faces a criminal trial in March of next year.

If convicted of his crimes, Whtie could be put in prison for the rest of his life.

'If i have to go to prison, I won't be hurting anybody but myself this time.

'It's just me answering up to the things I've done.

'My family - they've got jobs and lives - I won't be hurting this time.'
