A thoughtful husband has given his wife a birthday present she will never forget - after commissioning 23 artists to create works of art of his family.

Ernst Berlin came up with the idea for the unique gift after discovering a community of artists on the website Reddit.

Determined to give his wife, Agnes, something special, Ernst contacted between 45 and 50 artists who had some of the most successful submissions on the site.

Ernst Berlin (pictured with his nine-month-old son Jacob), from Chicago, has given his wife Agnes a birthday present she will never forget - after commissioning 23 artists to create unique works of art of his family

The artworks were each based on various photographs of the family supplied to the 23 artists for inspiration

Mr Berlin, 33, asked 50 artists to paint a picture of his son Jacob (above) and was pleased that 23 responded

Mr Berlin filmed his wife's reaction to the works - created by a range of artists - and posted the video online

Baby Bond: The images came in over a period months - and Mr Berlin liked them all, so he hung them all up

To his surprise, 23 artists replied. Ernst, whose nine-month-old son Jacob would also feature in the pictures, said he liked all of their works so much he couldn't turn them down.

As an amateur photographer, Ernst, 33, decided to send the artists a selection of 40 pictures of his family, allowing them to choose which they would like to work with.

Over a period of a few months, the images kept coming in.

When her birthday came around, Ernst treated Agnes, now 34, to a three-hour-long spa treatment - allowing him to hang the works on the wall while she was out.

Agnes' reaction was one of shock, with Ernst filming her response and later putting it on YouTube for friends and family to see.

Mr Berlin, an amateur photographer, found the artists on website Reddit, and after initially asking the group  if anyone was interested, was surprised when submissions kept coming in over a period of several months

Mr Berlin's nine-month-old son Jacob became the star of the show - and featured in the majority of the pieces

The artists chose from 40 pictures altogether, such as this cute image of Jacob resting on his mother's belly

After receiving the final artworks back from the artists, Mr Berlin hung them around the house for his wife

Mr Berlin, 33, said: 'I was worried about not finishing it in time, but luckily it all worked out'

He then waited over a period of several months for the artists' own creations to be returned to him

Mr Berlin said the response to his idea from his family and friends has been overwhelmingly positive

The idea to approach the artists was a 'light bulb moment', according to Mr Berlin. Pictured: A photograph of young Jacob (left) and a replica artwork supplied by one of the artists which Mr Berlin found on Reddit

Ernst, from Chicago, Illinois,  said: 'I completely forgot about Reddit until I sat down and started brainstorming ideas for a gift.

'A light bulb went off and I remembered the community of artists.

'I gathered a group of around 45 to 50 artists and got in contact with them to commission the work.

'23 replied - which was more than I expected - but I loved all their previous work so much that I couldn't say no to any of them.

'Honestly, I was worried about not finishing it in time, but luckily it all worked out.

'The response has been overwhelmingly positive from friends and family.'
