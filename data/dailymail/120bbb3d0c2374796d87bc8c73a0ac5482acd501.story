Television history: Don Johnson as detective James 'Sonny' Crockett and Philip Michael Thomas as detective Ricardo 'Rico' Tubbs stand by the prized vehicle

Bidding will close for the sought-after Testarossa on January 7 and currently there are more than 600 people 'watching' the lot item.

There is a 'Buy It Now' option; otherwise the motor will go to the top-paying customer.

The car's current owner, Danny Lima, from Florida, told Fox News he purchased the motor around three years ago after discovering  it had been left stagnant in a Miami garage for many years.

Before he snapped it up, it was last sold in 1991.   

Real deal: The Testarossa was one of the fastest and most powerful rides of its day, boasting a top speed of 180mph and rallying from zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds

Stamps to prove it: The vehicle comes with all of its service records, plus documentation back to the day it was delivered to Universal Studios

The white ride with tan leather seats was one of two Ferraris used for  filming in Miami Vice and it is listed with 16,000 miles on the clock.

It comes with all of its service records, plus paper work back to the day it was delivered to Universal Studios.

The MIAMI VICE VIN plate is also included.

The show first filmed with a replica Ferrari to save costs, but when the car manufacturer found out, it donated two authentic cars.

Apparently, Ferrari had one stipulation to the donation; the offending replica  car had to be destroyed during an episode.

Other well-known Testarossa owners include Elton John and Austrian Formula One racing driver, Gerhard Berger. 

According to the classic car insurance company Hagerty, a perfect 1986 Testarossa without a TV affiliation is worth approximately $89,000.

That's about the same price they sold for new in the Eighties.
