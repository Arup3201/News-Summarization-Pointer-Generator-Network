Stephen Ward’s terror that he would be destroyed by the Establishment for his role in the Profumo scandal is revealed in his own words in newly released papers.

The high-society figure, who introduced Minister of War John Profumo to Christine Keeler, a former topless model, made the comments in previously unseen, 50-year-old police statements.

Their publication follows a 14-month Freedom of Information battle between this newspaper and the Metropolitan Police Service.

The 1963 scandal threatened to bring down the Government of the day. Profumo was exposed as having lied to Parliament about his affair with Keeler, and it was also reported that she had slept with Soviet military attaché Eugene Ivanov – a link that potentially compromised national security.

Ward feared reprisals by the ruling Conservative Party. On April 26, 1963, he said: ‘I could bring down the Government, but I won’t do that. I think the Conservative Party are trying to get me, they will if they can to save themselves.’

The papers will reinforce fears that Ward was a scapegoat for the scandal, and that his subsequent conviction for living off the immoral earnings of Keeler – whom he had introduced to Profumo in 1961 – and Mandy Rice-Davies was a miscarriage of justice.

The papers reveal how Ward, a successful osteopath, was initially happy to co-operate with police, but then began to fear the effect of the scandal on his life. On June 4, 1963, he told officers: ‘I entreat you to deal with this matter as quickly as possible as the strain is bringing me near to a nervous breakdown.’

In the same interview, Ward casts doubt on the strength of the case against him: ‘It is ridiculous to say I have received money for introducing girls to men.

‘Of course I always had pretty girls around me. I also took them to parties and introduced them to other men, but if this was followed up by them, and the men gave them presents, surely I cannot be blamed for that?’

Ward was put on trial, but took an overdose of sleeping tablets shortly after the prosecution’s summing-up. He was convicted while he lay in a coma, from which he never awoke.

On June 5, 1963, Profumo resigned from the Government, three months after telling Parliament rumours of his affair with Keeler were untrue.

The Criminal Cases Review Commission is considering an application by Geoffrey Robertson QC to have Ward’s conviction overturned.
