TV presenter Sarah Beeny says she has finally 'realised her dreams' by legally listing her controversial mansion as a wedding venue.

Beeny and her husband Graham Swift said they have overcome a 'stressful' 12 months to open Rise Hall, near Hornsea, East Yorkshire, for bookings.

They bought the former convent 10 years ago and were granted a wedding licence by East Riding Council in 2010, although couples were not allowed to get married 'over concerns for the health and safety of their registrars'.

Beeny’s run-ins with the authority over the property featured in her Channel 4 programme, Beeny’s Restoration Nightmare.

The
 couple bought the 33-bedroom property for £441,101 in 2001 and part of 
the TV series showed a section of it being turned into a 
wedding venue.

However, Beeny had not yet applied for a planning application for weddings which angered her local Councillor.

She has now put all the wrangles with the council behind her.

The property developer said: 'Both Graham and I are so pleased that we are able to realise our dreams in bringing this beautiful house alive again and we look forward to sharing Rise Hall with future couples who are now able to get married here.'

Earlier in 2011 Humberside Fire and 
Rescue Service restricted use of the first-floor bedrooms as there was 
no 'protected means of escape'.

Speaking last year Beeny said: 'Every
 time we agree things, they say they want more things; I think our 
frustration is that Rise Hall is a really important significant building
 and everything has been done to a really high standard.

'They don’t have a problem with what we have done, their problem is that we didn’t talk to them enough about it.'

The presenter also had to submit a retrospective application to turn Rise Hall into a home,
 because she did not apply for change of use permission when she started
 living there.

Beeny and her husband Graham Swift say the hall never had planning permission, and had been a family home in the past.

But 
local councillor Matthew Grove told the Hull Daily Mail: 'The ordinary 
man in the street has to jump through hoops to get even the smallest 
extension approved.

'Yet here we have a listed building being changed, with no planning permission in place, and without anyone batting an eyelid.'

Beeny said they had spent £12,000 getting a certificate of lawful development to prove the former 
school was being used as a private residence, even though the council 
knew they had been living in it for 10 years.

The Grade II- star listed building boasts 28 rooms sleeping 56 guests and has seven reception rooms.

The venue will be managed by events specialists Dine.

Daniel Gill, managing  director of Dine, said: 'Rise Hall is a beautiful country house, which has been painstakingly restored by Sarah and Graham to bring it back to its former glory.

'The team at Dine is really enjoying 
working with the couple at this fairytale venue and we can’t wait to 
make brides’ dream wedding come true.'
