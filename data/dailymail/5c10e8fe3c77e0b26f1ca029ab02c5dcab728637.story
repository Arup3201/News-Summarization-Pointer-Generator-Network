British tourists abroad have long been described as sunburned, drunk and wearing questionable footwear.

And a survey today confirms this traditional stereotype - as the French, Germans and Spanish all agree that UK travellers were the heaviest drinkers on holiday.

However, the Brits' sense of humour and open-mindedness made up for their red shoulders and debateable sense of fashion, according to Travelzoo.

Fun-loving party spirit: UK travellers were said to be the heaviest drinkers on holiday but also the ones with the best sense of humour

The online travel agency asked people in the four European nations what they thought of stereotypes about themselves and tourists from the other four countries.

Richard Singer, Travelzoo European managing director, said: 'Luckily for us Brits, our world-famous sense of humour continues to be our saving grace on foreign shores.

'Our fun-loving party spirit also came out in the feedback from other nations, but perhaps a little restraint with the sangria and sunshine is called for, as well as a little more care in our appearance when hitting the beach!'Â 

Stereotypes: Spanish tourists were described as helpful, while UK travellers as sunburned

More than half of the Spanish polled said Britons were the least generous on holiday, while the other European travellers seem to perceive the Germans as 'pushy', 'demanding' and 'beer drinkers' when abroad.

Overall, Spanish tourists were voted by the other three countries as the most likeable, topping the lists for being the most corteous, generous, friendly and helpful.

On the other hand, the French were the least popular, as they were labelled 'arrogant' and 'rude' - a stereotype for which they are known around the world.

Half of Britons criticised French travellers for lacking humour, and a further 47 per cent said the French lack courtesy,

The overwhelming majority of French travellers, however, thought of themselves as courteous individuals.

And while French may have high views of themselves, Germans turned out to be most self-critical, with 55 per cent admitting that the stereotypical German traveller was not generous enough.

Some 47 per cent of Germans also thought themselves not child-friendly, but this was in stark contrast with UK and French tourists' view, who substantially thought that their 'beer drinkers' cousins are actually good with children.
