This firework would certainly make sure any Independence Day party went off with a bang.

Weighing an impressive 930lb and with an incredible 48" diameter, the Yonshakudama is understood to be the world's largest single firework.

The $1,500 firework rises to 2,700ft and has a bloom diameter of more than 2,400ft.

The $1,500 firework, which rises to 2,700ft and has a bloom diameter of more than 2,400ft, was created by Honda Masanori's Katakai Fireworks Co in Niigata Prefecture, Japan

The firework is set off every September 9 and 10 for the Katakai-Matsuri Festival in Katakai town (pictured is a controller for the firework)

Everything in the factory is earthed and all lights are hooked up to special safety switches which do not create sparks.

Once put together the firework is loaded into tubes ready to be launched thousands of feet into the night sky.

The
 Yonshakudama shell comes in two types - the 'Brocade crown over small 
flowers' and the 'Floral shell of shells twice blooming'.

The firework is fired from huge launching tubes. Pictured is a launching tube destroyed by one of the fireworks

The Yonshakudama however would most certainly not be suitable for the latest extreme hobby taken up by a team of skydivers, who now set off fireworks as they leap from their plane.

It was reported last week how the latest craze in extreme sports, pyrotechnic skydiving, sees the team of four divers activate sets of fireworks strapped to their legs as they fall through the air at speeds of up to 120mph.

Professional skydiving team Fastrax, based in Ohio, USA, have long wowed audiences with their ambitious stunts but their latest effort boasts the added danger of fireworks attached to the divers' ankles.
