When Kyle Eastmond takes the field at Twickenham on Saturday he will do so conceding almost five stone in weight and eight inches in height to his gargantuan opposite man Sonny Bill Williams.

If it were a boxing match, it wouldn’t have got past the weigh in.

But they say rugby is a game for all shapes and sizes and, despite an apparently inexorable upward trend favouring brawn over brain, it is testament to the sport that Eastmond will start with at least a fighting chance against one of the most powerful sportsmen on earth.

‘I've never been big, so I'm used to it,’ said the 5ft7in inside centre  when asked if he was concerned about the size differential between him and his opponent.

‘You just get in there. It's not all about size. You have to understand your opposite number, what he's going to do and be ready for that.

‘I know Sonny Bill has a great off-load and things like that, but you've also got to keep an eye on (Aaron) Cruden and then (Israel) Dagg.

‘You have to be excited. I’m excited to play against the best players in the world. That's why I'm here. I don't want to be messing around, I want to play the best in the world. I'm looking forward to it.’

Eastmond’s excitement at the prospect of going toe-to-toe with a man who, aside from a stellar career in both rugby codes, has also gone undefeated in six professional boxing bouts, is especially admirable considering his last international appearance.

Substituted after 40 minutes of England’s third Test thumping in Hamilton in June, a fifth Test cap looked a long way off for the 12st8in centre.

But his superb Aviva Premiership form for Bath this season has seen him make an irresistible case for a recall alongside Brad Barritt in England’s midfield. A conversation with Stuart Lancaster at the end of the tour, when the former St Helens rugby league star vowed to return a better player, also left a mark on the England coach.

‘There was no big meeting, no massive talk,’ Eastmond, 25, said. ‘It was a little bit of a chat at the airport. The last Test didn't go as well as we’d have liked, for the team and for me as an individual.

‘I'm not stupid enough to think 40 minutes is going to put me back. Every single player has their ups and downs in their career, but it's how you come back. That's what I tried to do when I got back to Bath.’

Lancaster conceded on Thursday that he expected the All Blacks to target the diminutive former rugby league star. But Eastmond appeared utterly unconcerned by the prospect.

With superb feet and a willingness to play flat to the gain line, Eastmond has flourished in Bath’s midfield alongside George Ford and Jonathan Joseph. On Saturday, with the Saracens pair of Barritt and Owen Farrell completing England’s midfield, he will be charged with reproducing that form.

Soon, he will also need to prove himself against another hulking opponent in new Bath team-mate Sam Burgess, who has known from his league days as a 14-year-old.

Eastmond feigned ignorance when asked what he thought about the prospect of the current international rugby league player of the year wanting to take his shirt at club and international level by answering ‘does he?’ with a broad grin.

But, following a tough baptism in union which saw him finish last season struggling for first-team action at Bath, Eastmond knows better than most how difficult the cross-code switch can be.

‘The transition isn't easy,’ he said. ‘It takes people different timescales in how they fit in.

‘I can understand the shapes rugby union run now, it looks similar to league, but it's a completely different game. There's a lot to learn before you can really excel. I'm sure Sam will do that.’
