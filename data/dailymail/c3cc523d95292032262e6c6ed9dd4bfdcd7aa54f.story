Jennifer Kesse went missing nine years ago - and police hope that a newly-released, age-progressed photograph might bring to light fresh information in the suspected abduction.

On the morning of January 24, 2006, Miss Kesse, then 24, was reported missing when she failed to show up for work at Central Florida Investments in Orlando.  

Her Chevy Malibu car was later found a mile away from her newly-purchased condo at the Mosaic At Millenia subdivision.

Police released this grainy image in 2007 of an individual near the scene of Miss Kesse's disappearance but it produced no leads  

According to a website set up by her family, the 24-year-old had just spent a long weekend in St Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands with her boyfriend and a group of friends.

Her family said it was completely out of character for Jennifer not to call if she was going to be late for work.

Jennifer and her boyfriend, who lived several hours away in south Florida, would call each other on the drive to work each morning.

The day before she disappeared, Jennifer had left her boyfriend's home to drive to work in Ocoee, Florida. That evening, she left her office around 6pm and wished her boss a good evening.

She chatted to her parents, brother, boyfriend and some friends on the phone at home that evening.

The last person to speak to Jennifer was her boyfriend, in a call shortly before 10pm on the Monday night.

The next morning, when her boyfriend called her office, he was told that Jennifer had not arrived. 

Her employer then alerted her family, who could not reach her at her home or on her cellphone. Police were informed within two hours.

The family went to their daughter's new condo and said it appeared 'normal' - clean and with everything in place.

She had slept in her bed, taken a shower (as indicated by a wet towel and shower) and left out clothes on the bed.

Jennifer appeared to have disappeared after leaving her home around 7.30am.

Her car was found on Thursday, January 26 at a condo complex around a mile down the road from where she lived.

Surveillance footage later revealed a suspect pulling into a parking space in her car, waiting around 30 seconds, climbing out and walking away.

Despite more than a thousand tips, police have not been able to work out what happened to the missing woman.

In 2007, police released grainy surveillance footage of the suspect who had been driving her car. It was not clear if the person was a man or a woman and no information came from the tape. 

Miss Kesse, 24, vanished in 2006 after leaving her home to go to work. Despite multiple appeals, few details have been found about her disappearance

Five years later, police gathered a panel of experts to review the case but no new information came to light. 

An age-progressed photo of the missing woman was released by police this week, completed by a police forensic artist, to show what she might look like today.

'We ask for the public's help in circulating this photo via social media in hopes of finding Jennifer and returning her to her family,' police said. 

The missing woman's parents, Joyce and Drew Kesse, have never given up searching for her and continually update their website Findjenniferkesse.com and Facebook page. 

For months after their daughter disappeared, the desperate parents stood at a busy intersection at rush hour and waved signs about Jennifer, the Orlando Sentinel reported. 

Her parents told Fox this week: 'We've embraced the hope that right now, nine years later, nothing definitively proves that Jennifer has been murdered. Nothing indicates that she is alive. 

'If you are parents in our shoes, you are going to hope that she is the next miracle.'

Jennifer Kesse is 5'8' and weighed 125lb when she went missing. She had sandy blonde, shoulder-length hair and has green eyes.

The Orlando Police Department asked anyone with information on Jennifer’s whereabouts or details of what happened to her to call Crimeline at 1-800-423-TIPS.
