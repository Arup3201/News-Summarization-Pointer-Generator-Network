Say goodbye to double chins with a new ‘fat-eater’ treatment that doesn’t need surgery.

According to scientists, a pioneering way to remove unsightly chin fat has had promising results in early trials.

Four injections of an agent known as ATX-101 into the chin led to the production of cells that ‘gobbled up’ spare fat which was reabsorbed into the body.

The ‘happiness rating’ of patients with their new appearance doubled after treatment, compared with a ‘dummy’ agent.

Matt Gass, of the British Association of Dermatologists, said: ‘This research is a very exciting step towards a safe and non-surgical solution to removing unwanted chin fat.

‘For people experiencing negative psychological effects of this unwanted fat on their appearance, this procedure, if approved, may open up the option of minimally invasive treatment with proven efficacy.’

At present, people who are unhappy with a double chin - or more - can turn to liposuction or have neck and face lifts to get rid of the excess.

The 'happiness rating' of patients (not pictured) with their new appearance doubled after treatment, compared with a 'dummy' agent.

But these treatments are not suitable for everyone, and the need for anaesthesia, an operating room and qualified staff substantially increases costs and risks.

There are other non-surgical approaches available, including the non-invasive use of vacuum therapy to break up pockets of fat combined with Multiple Radio Frequency to encourage tightening afterwards.

However, a limited number of clinical trials have been published showing the effectiveness of the various techniques.

The new treatment targets unappealing fat deposits beneath the chin, otherwise known as submental fat, or more colloquially as a ‘double chin’.

Dermatologists from the UK, France, Germany, Belgium and Spain investigated the effect of injections of ATX-101 - a synthetically derived form of the bile acid, deoxycholic acid - into the fat.

ATX-101 reduces submental fat by irreversibly disrupting fat cell membranes and causing destruction of fat cells.

The injections trigger an inflammatory response that promotes the arrival of highly specialised cells called macrophages into the chin fat.

These ‘gobble up’ the debris resulting from destruction of the fat cells over time, with the unwanted fat being reabsorbed into the body.

In the trial, 363 men and women aged 18 to 65 had four injections four weeks apart of the active agent or a dummy placebo, says a report published in the British Journal of Dermatology.

Only those with moderate to severe submental fat who expressed dissatisfaction with the appearance of their face and chin were eligible to take part.

The findings showed significantly more ATX-101 recipients had improvements in 5-point fat ratings scale by a doctor and by themselves on a 7-point satisfaction scale.

The trial used two different dosages of ATX-101 as well as a placebo.

With the higher dosage of ATX-101, 65 per cent of patients had a reduction in submental fat of at least one point on the fat rating scale compared with 23 per cent with the placebo.

Two thirds patients were happy with their face and chin appearance, versus 29 per cent for the placebo.

In addition, measurements using a calliper showed a significant reduction in submental fat, with no apparent worsening of skin looseness.

Following treatment, patients also reported a reduction in the psychological impact they felt due to the appearance of their face and chin.

The treatment was found to invoke just a mild inflammatory response and the procedure was well tolerated by patients.

Lead author Professor Berthold Rzany said ‘This study demonstrates that subcutaneous injections with ATX-101 yield a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in unwanted submental fat, decrease the psychological impact on patients, and are well tolerated.

‘This study and three additional phase III clinical trials of ATX-101 will provide the first true evidence base for non-surgical submental fat reduction.’
