An overweight father has danced away the pounds and overcome a barrage of jokes - by joining his seven-year-old daughter’s all-girl cheerleading team.

Darren Peacock, 32, was 17st 5lb when he was jokingly dragged onto the floor mat while watching daughter Amy Jorja wave pompoms at her local cheerleading group.

The father-of-two was left out of breath and with aches and pains all over after being asked to help out with the lifting and tumbling.

He was horrified at how out of shape he was, so agreed to become the only male member of the Hunters Cheerleading troupe in Horwich near Bolton, Greater Manchester, thinking it could be a great way to shift some pounds and get fit.

A cheery good way to lose weight: Formerly overweight father Darren Peacock has shed nearly three stone after he volunteered to help out with his daughter Amy Jorja's cheerleading squad

Before and after: Thanks to his newfound hobby, Darren, pictured, left, 17st 5lb, has shed almost three stone and is now 14st 12lb, right

Thanks to his newfound hobby, Darren has shed almost three stone and is now 14st 12lb - and the 6ft 2in administration clerk has had the last laugh on male workmates who crack jokes about him 'waving pompoms' and 'wearing a rah-rah skirt'.

He said: 'The lads at work give me stick all the time, but I don’t care. I enjoy it. It’s fun plus there's the health aspect too. I've lost three stone and I put a lot of that down to the cheerleading and eating healthier.

'In fact I am in the stunt group at Hunters so there’s no pompom waving. It’s definitely more manly. There are five of us doing various throwing, twisting and catching.

'Amy and I practise together at home a lot. It’s mainly me helping her with her stretching, balancing and tumbling. We’ll even practice when we’re on holiday.'

Star cheerleader: Darren has now competed alongside Amy in the Hunters team and says it has been an incredible boost to his fitness

Proud family: Darren, who has a wife Laura, 30, and a 10-year-old son Mark, said: 'Cheerleading is a great hobby and getting fit has been an added bonus'

Spot the dad! The father-of-two from Bolton enjoyed his new hobby so much he decided to join the senior team in January 2012 and began training three times a week

Darren started his hobby after taking his daughter Amy Jorja to cheerleading practice when she joined in 2011. Darren would watch with pride as his little girl was tossed up into the air and taught to cheer.

'I’d
 definitely advise other men to get involved. It’s better than the gym. 
It’s not all about doing feminine moves like shaking your hips - it’s 
throwing and catching mainly'

Eventually Amy’s coach dragged Darren onto the mat to help out with catching the little ones. The father-of-two from Bolton enjoyed his new hobby so much he decided to join the senior team in January 2012 and began training three times a week.

The father-and-daughter pair even have matching training outfits and Darren ignores banter from his friends at work and continues to wear his with pride.

Darren has also embraced a new healthy diet to make sure he is at the top of his game at competitions.

Matchy matchy: The duo even have matching cheerleading outfits and Darren ignores banter from his friends at work and continues to wear his with pride

Asset: The coach says that Darren is a huge asset to the team thanks to his strength and determination - and his skills help his daughter improve

'When I first started two years ago I was 17 and a half stone and I was really unfit. Amy’s coach Alicia dragged me onto the mat to help out with catching and throwing and I felt really out of breath afterwards. I was aching all over that was it - I got the bug.

'Cheerleading has inspired me to stop eating rubbish food and be more healthy so I can perform better at competitions.'

Darren and Amy Jorja have competed at three competitions so far and are showing no signs of stopping.

Not a pom pom in sight! Darren says that cheerleading has inspired him to stop eating rubbish food and be more healthy so he can perform better at competitions, which he says is more throwing and catching that prancing around

Darren said: 'At our last competition my stunt group came fourth and Amy’s junior team came second. It was such a good feeling to do so well and we want to continue to work hard to get to first place.

'I’d definitely advise other men to get involved. It’s better than the gym. It’s not all about doing feminine moves like shaking your hips - it’s throwing and catching mainly.'

Hunters coach Alicia-Paris Fairclough said: 'Darren is a complete asset to our senior squad and plays a huge role within the team. He brings enthusiasm, a fantastic work ethic and, of course, immense strength.

'His daughter is in our youngest squad and his extensive knowledge in the stunts we do helps his daughter’s understanding and progression.'
