A university students union has hit out at a Cardiff promotions company for distributing charts encouraging new students to record their sexual conquests alongside when they drink so much alcohol that they vomit.

Climax Promotions has been giving out freshers packs which contain charts which are divided into two sides - on one side is a 'shagchart' - for recording sexual conquests - and on the other a 'chunderchart' - for tallying how many times students have vomited as a result of binge drinking.

The company, which bills itself as Cardiff's top events company and boasts on its website of bringing 'you the best value for money and the most exciting events',  last year was linked to a promotion that featured a t-shirt with the words, 'I was raping a woman last night and she cried'.

MailOnline has attempted to reach Climax Promotions for comment, but is yet to receive a response.

Cardiff University Students' Union vice president Faraz Alauddin not only distanced the union from the promotion he called for Climax Promotions to be banned from the campus.

He said: 'Promoters will try and jump onto everything.

'Climax have absolutely nothing to do with us. Climax has nothing to do with us, we try and and kick them off. They shouldn't be here, they shouldn't be on campus.

'Cardiff University Students' Union does not support, endorse or encourage this sort of promotional material or lad culture, more generally.'

He added: 'The students' union has a strict advertising policy that does not allow such material on campus.

'We believe that the item in the image was distributed by an external company promoting themselves outside of our building and are not in any way associated with the students' union.'

Roz Hardie, the chief executive of Object, which challenges the objectification of women, said young men needed to understand the difference between 'flirting and harassment' and that anyone who had the chart on their wall was signalling they were 'someone to avoid'.

Ms Hardie said the company behind the chart was doing 'far more than encouraging young people to enjoy themselves', and she hoped the student community as a whole would consider whether they were the type of company they should support.

The promotion follows research published earlier this month showing that a culture of heavy drinking has led to sexual molestation becoming the norm on a night out for young women.

In a disturbing insight into how 18 to 24-year-olds behave on a night out, a survey has found one in three girls received inappropriate or unwanted physical attention or groping, but few were surprised.

Academics said that excessive consumption of alcohol has turned Britain’s pubs and clubs into a ‘permissive social arena’.

The report comes nine years after Labour controversially relaxed Britain’s licensing laws to allow 24-hour drinking despite police, judges, health workers and a Daily Mail campaign all warning the policy would prove to be a disaster.

The findings were revealed in a report for the charity Drinkaware, which is urging women to stop tolerating behaviour which would be considered unacceptable when sober.

ICM researchers found that 31 per cent of young women said they were touched inappropriately on a drunken night out. But only 19 per cent said they were surprised by it.

In addition, more than a quarter (27 per cent) have put up with inappropriate sexual comments or abuse on a drunken night out.
