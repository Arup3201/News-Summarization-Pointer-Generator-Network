The United States last night demanded an urgent investigation into allegations that the  Syrian government used poison gas on opposition fighters.

Washington claimed it has proof that a toxic chemical, thought to be chlorine, was used earlier this month in a helicopter attack on a rebel stronghold in the town of Kfar Zeita.

A US State Department spokesman said: 'We are examining allegations that the government was responsible. Obviously there needs to be an investigation of what's happened here.'

US Secretary of State John Kerry was 
briefing President Barack Obama on the disturbing development last night
 amid speculation that, if substantiated, the chemical use could spur 
tougher action against president Bashar al-Assad's embattled regime.

The
 US statement came hours after French president Francois Hollande 
accused Syria of carrying out chlorine gas attacks.

He said that Western
 officials had found 'credible evidence' of the gas being used in at 
least three locations this month.

'What
 we have seen from this regime is the horrific methods it is capable of 
using and the rejection of any political transition,' Mr Hollande added.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad marked Easter by visiting a Christian town near Damascus recently recaptured by his forces, state media reported. The claims come days ahead of an April 27 deadline for Assad's government to have handed over Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles for destruction

Syrian opposition activists said helicopters dropped chlorine gas on Kfar Zeita on April 11 and 12.

With
 the US confirming 'indications' of a chemical drop, it appears the 
Syrian authorities may be using a toxin that was not covered under a 
deal to destroy its chemical arsenal.

While chlorine is not a banned chemical agent, its use in weapons is barred under the 1925 Chemical Weapons Convention.

The
 UN has said that sarin gas was likely to have been used in Jobar, on 
the outskirts of Damascus, in August and in other places including the 
rebel-held suburb of Ghouta, where hundreds were killed, causing global 
outrage.
