Proper burial: 20-year-old RAF pilot Sergeant David Raikes' body was only found in 2011

An RAF crew whose remains were discovered more than 65 years after they were shot down over Italy are to be given a funeral with full military honours.

Amateur historians located the remains of three war heroes in the wreckage of the Douglas A-20 Boston after their bomber plane crashed into a field and burst into a huge fireball.

The trio, all aged 21, died and a fourth crew member, an Australian, who was attached to the RAF was also killed in the crash which took place just two weeks before World War Two ended.

Pilot flt sgt David Raikes, radio operator flight sgt Alexander Bostock and navigator flt sgt David Perkins were all members of the RAF Volunteers and attached 18 Squadron based at Odiham in Hampshire.

The squadron which carried out numerous operations across Europe during World War Two is famous for dropping an artificial leg to war legend Douglas Bader and its motto is 'With Courage and Faith'.

The Australian pilot John Hunt, 21, was the aircraft gunner and all four are listed on a war memorial in Malta dedicated to RAF servicemen who lost their lives during the War.

They were initially listed as missing in action and then officially declared dead a few months later but Commonwealth War Graves records show that no burial site or remains were ever found for them.

Poignant: Amateur historians using metal detectors unearthed a ring inscribed 'Chris, with love' at the crash site

Historians located the wreckage in a field at Copparo near Ferrara two years ago and using metal detectors they also unearthed personal items belonging to crew including a ring and a wristwatch.

The ring is thought to belong to Perkins and is engraved with his initials and the words 'Chris, with love' while the watch has gunner Hunt's name on it and his service number.

Sgt Raikes, whose father was a Lt Colonel in the RAF, was from Redhill, Surrey and educated at Oxford University and was famous after the war for a collection of poems he wrote put together by his teacher.

According to war office records Sgt Bostock was from Kimberley, Nottinghamshire while his colleague Sgt Perkins was from Sydenham, south London.

Uncovered: This ring, thought to belong to David Perkins, was found at the site, near the town of Copparo, close to Ferrara

Following the discovery of the remains, an appeal was launched for relatives to get in touch and the hunt was led by the British Embassy and military historians in London and Canberra.

Relatives have now been traced and family members of all four crew members will be travelling to the ceremony which will take place on July 18 at a Commonwealth War Graves cemetery in Padova.

Records show that the Boston had taken off from Forli airfield near Bologna in the late evening of April 21 1945 to attack a river crossing at Taglio di Po before going on an 'armed reconnaissance mission.'

Poetry: A volume of David Raikes' poems was published in 1954 by a don who had taught him at Trinity College, Oxford

Simone Guidorzi who led the hunt said: 'We knew the rough area where the plane crashed from speaking to locals who are still alive and were children at the time.

'They said they saw the plane crash with one of its wings broken off and an engine ripped away. It burnt for two days and once the locals managed to get close they salvaged some of the valuable metal parts.

'No remains were recovered and over the years the remains just sank into the ground but we decided to investigate and have now recovered the remains of the plane and human body parts.

'A watch belonging to Hunt was found and a ring with Perkins initials was also recovered using metal detectors.'

Flt sgt Raikes was a pupil at Radley College, where a poetry prize in his name is given out each year and a book of his works was published posthumously in 1954.

In one of his poems, Let It Be Hushed, he wrote: 'These men knew moments you have never known,/Nor ever will; we knew those moments too,/And talked of them in whispers late at night;/ Such confidence was born of danger shared./We shared their targets, too; but we came back.

Lightly we talked of it. We packed their kit,/ Divided up such common useful things/ As cigarettes and chocolate, rations stored/ Against a rainy day that never came.'

In a statement British embassy in Rome said: 'Relatives of the four men will be meeting for the first time, coming from the United Kingdom and Australia, in what will be a very moving occasion commemorating the life of these men who lost their lives at such a young age.

'Some of the wreckage of the aircraft and some surviving personal belongings will be presented to the relatives of the four servicemen.'

The event is being organised by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force with the help of the British Embassy in Rome.

Participating in the event will be serving representatives of both Air Forces, including members of Queenâ€™s Colour Squadron and 18 Squadron, as well as Italian military and civilian representatives.
