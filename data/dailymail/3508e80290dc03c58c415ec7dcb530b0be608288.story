It was the 11-minute fireworks spectacular that wowed the world.

To the gasps of the thrilled crowd thronging the banks of the Thames, a dazzling display of rockets shot out from the arches above Big Ben’s famous dials, kicking off a spectacular pyrotechnic show.

More than 250,000 revellers watched the breathtaking display, which cost £274,000 and demonstrated that London is the best in the world at putting on a show to celebrate the New Year.
