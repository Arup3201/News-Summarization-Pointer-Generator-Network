Pippa Middleton showed off her impeccable taste in wedding outfits again today as she attended the union of close friends in London.

The Duchess of Cambridge's stylish sister wore a bright orange-red dress with short sleeves and sheer panels, accessorising with contrasting navy blue Bundle MacLaren hat, matching clutch and satin court shoes.

The happy couple, Katherine Phillips and David Marsham, are close friends of both William and Kate, and attended the royal wedding last year.

After her rear stole the spotlight at her sister's wedding  thanks to her figure-hugging bridesmaid's gown, Pippa has built up a reputation for having the perfect wedding guest look.

The 28-year-old looked radiant today with her hair pulled back, a gold-edged clutch bag and 18ct yellow gold and blue topaz hoop earrings by London-based jeweller Kiki McDonough.

She frequently picks bright colours in a demure cut for weddings, and recently wore a pink wrap Issa dress for a friend’s wedding in Scotland, along with a similar headpiece, covered in netting and pink flowers.

The loud shade and sheer panels on her outfit today were balanced out by the high neck and navy trim, plus lashing of her trademark thick black eyeliner.

David, Viscount Marsham, is one of the Duke of Cambridge's 'inner sanctum' friends, and was seated in the Statesmen’s Aisle in Westminster Abbey’s north transept for the royal wedding, which was reserved for the couple’s close friends and family.

The Duke of Cambridge was also expected to attend the glamorous event, but was not spotted among the elegant guests chatting in the sunshine outside.

David and Katherine, both 35, followed in William and Kate's footsteps by getting engaged after celebrating with the nation at the wedding last year.

Even Katherine's gown was reminiscent of the Duchess's wedding outfit, as she chose a veil, white lace and sleeved cover-up.

David, a former major in the Scots Guards and heir of the Earl of Romney, delighted his parents with the news of his engagement. 'We are so excited for him,' said his mother, the Countess of Romney.
