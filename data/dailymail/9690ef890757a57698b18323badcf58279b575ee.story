Roy Keane is back at Old Trafford as a pundit for BBC Sport ahead of Monday night's FA Cup quarter-final between Manchester United and Arsenal.

The former United captain joined presenter Gary Lineker, former adversary Alan Shearer and Ian Wright in the Old Trafford studio to provide his views on the quarter-final clash.

Keane, who has never been afraid to air his views either in his TV work or in his two autobiographies, was working with the BBC for the first time having previously worked for ITV.

Keane was famously red carded for lashing out at Shearer with a punch at St James' Park in 2001 - but the pair seemed happy enough to sit next to each other in the studio on Monday.

He also joked that he hated Wright, who played for Arsenal while the pair were both players and there were moments that their debate became heated at Old Trafford.

In Keane's book The Second Half, he includes Shearer, on a list with Alf-Inge Haaland, Rob Lee, David Batty and Patrick Vieira in as players 'at the back of my mind'.

Keane made it clear that although he regularly came across Alan Shearer while working as a TV pundit, there is little or no chance of them ever building bridges such is the mutual dislike of each other. 

Wright talked briefly about the rivalry and hatred between Arsenal and Manchester United

Last year, Wright claimed in a video on his YouTube channel that Keane was the best TV pundit around at the moment.

'Roy Keane is the best,' the former Arsenal striker said. 'He's got credibility and he's another one who doesn't care what anyone thinks. What he says is most probably right but it's brutally honest and some people don't like that.'

Keane last worked for ITV on their coverage of Chelsea's Champions League first-leg draw against Paris Saint-Germain on February 17.
