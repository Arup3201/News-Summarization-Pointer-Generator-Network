David Cameron has warned that Europe must get tougher with Vladimir Putin – or risk repeating the mistakes it made with Hitler.

He compared the response to Russian aggression with the disastrous appeasement of the Nazi dictator at the Munich conference in 1938.

Demanding a firmer line against Moscow’s stance in Ukraine, the Prime Minister voiced fears that Russia intends to conquer the rest of the country.

Mr Cameron made the private remarks to other EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on Saturday, according to Italian newspaper La Repubblica.

He was quoted as saying: ‘We run the  risk of repeating the mistakes made in Munich in 1938. We cannot know what will happen next. This time we cannot meet Putin’s demands.

‘He has already taken Crimea and we cannot allow him to take the whole  country.’ His reported comments come after Mr Putin threatened he could ‘take Kiev in a fortnight’ during a phone  call with EU Commission president Manuel Barroso.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told the Brussels summit that the Russian leader was ‘moving towards military escalation’ and there are ‘no limits to the unpredictability of Putin’.

Mr Cameron has denounced the presence of up to 15,000 Russian troops on Ukrainian soil as ‘unjustified and unacceptable’.

On Monday he told MPs that Moscow, which has already seized Crimea, was  trying to force its neighbour to ‘abandon  its democratic choices at the barrel of  a gun’. He will chair a Nato conference  in Wales later this week in which a new  force of 10,000 troops are expected to  be announced.

Last night it was reported that Britain is to order 600 Army infantry vehicles as  part of its commitment to raise defence spending. 

Defence minister Julian Brazier said a  platoon may also be sent in a fortnight to join Rapid Trident, the joint US–Ukraine exercise. In a speech today, Defence  Secretary Michael Fallon will warn that Nato’s ‘credibility’ depends on European leaders boosting military spending.

Only four members of the alliance – the US, UK, Estonia and Greece – meet a pledge to spend at least 2 per cent of their GDP on defence.

Mr Fallon will tell the Royal United Services Institute think-tank: ‘Nato was formed on the basis that Europe would pay her way. Like any insurance policy, defence only pays out when you pay in.

‘US taxpayers won’t go on picking up the cheque if we choose to prioritise social  welfare spending when the threats are on our doorstep.’

Russia has boosted defence spending by 50 per cent and has pledged to spend another £420billion over the next six years.   The Munich summit is now seen as the high point of the British and French appeasement of Adolf Hitler.

Afterwards, prime minister Neville  Chamberlain declared he had agreed ‘peace for our time’. However, appeasement allowed Germany to annexe parts of Czechoslovakia and is seen as encouraging further Nazi aggression and the outbreak of the Second World War.
