The Queen wants it to hurry up and arrive already; her cousin Margaret isn't much fussed; the photographers outside the Lindo Wing are going stir crazy; some of us are wondering if she's planning to fox the media and give birth in Reading, and we bet poor Kate's ready to murder someone in this equatorial heat.

From wherever you're standing, Royal Baby mania has reached fever pitch, and it's becoming difficult to keep abreast of what's really going on.

But if you're that desperate to be the first to know the minute-by-minute minutiae surrounding the future monarch... there's an app for that.

Kate's baby is due any day now, so if you want to keep abreast of what's happening download the new Royal Baby app for iPhone

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child, who will be the third in line to the throne, has caused a frenzy of excitement all over the world

Future, in association with international news wire Press Association, have released a free, commemorative mobile app to celebrate the birth of the first baby of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to be titled HRH Prince or Princess [name] of Cambridge, due any day now.

The app - which is suitable for iOS 5.0 or later on iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches - will provide updates about the birth, the baby, the parents and any other newsworthy developments.

It will sync news stories related to the Royal family's new arrival and any relevant Twitter developments, plus provide histories into previous royal births and the Middleton family.

Developers at Future who have released the app for free with special 60p add-ons, say: 'Welcome to the Royal Baby App, a celebration of Kate and Wills' happy day'

There are also a selection of 69p paid-for add-ons which delve more deeply into the families' histories, including one which explores the relationship Prince William's mother Diana had with her sons, and one about Prince William's relationship with Kate.

The app allows you to browse through the history of the new addition's family

Other sections catalogue photos of the former Kate Middleton in her new royal role, and photos of Prince William throughout his life.

Developers say: 'Welcome to the Royal Baby App, a celebration of Kate and Wills' happy day.

'Inside you'll be able to download our free special, packed with the first pictures of the new arrival as well as the happy parents. You'll also receive the latest news, Twitter rumours and more - all free.

'You can also download mini-apps packed with in-depth features, archive photography and the latest galleries of Wills, Kate, royal births through the ages, the happy great-grandparents, Uncle Harry and loads more.

'As time goes on, we'll keep both our free app and these specials updated with all the latest pictures and video of the new arrival and his/her proud parents.

'First steps, public appearances, royal visits - you'll get it all!'

Royal Baby mania has swept the city, the country, the world.... and now the iTunes store.

You can't move without tripping over a Guess The Name Of The Royal Baby app or an app that helps you 'royalify' your own infant.
