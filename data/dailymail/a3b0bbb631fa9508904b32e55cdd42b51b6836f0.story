Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has been passed fit for the champions' Barclays Premier League clash with Swansea at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.

The key centre-back missed City's last game against QPR a fortnight ago and Belgium's Euro 2016 qualifier against Wales with a calf injury but returned to training this week.

Fellow defender Eliaquim Mangala has also overcome a knock but playmaker David Silva (knee), left-back Aleksandar Kolarov and striker Edin Dzeko (both calf) have all been ruled out.

'Vincent Kompany had a small problem but he is available for the game tomorrow,' Manuel Pellegrini said. 'Frank Lampard is also ready to play as well. 

'I hope we can return to our normal form now the international break is over,' Pellegrini added, before admitting he expects a challenging encounter against Swansea.

'Swansea are a very good technical side and we are expecting a difficult afternoon,' he said.

Pellegrini believes his team need to claim close to maximum points in the remaining weeks of 2014 if they are to remain in title contention.

The Chilean sees the end of December as an important staging post in his side's defence of their Barclays Premier League crown and he knows they can ill afford to drop many more points.

It was at the same stage last season that City's title-winning campaign roared into life as they embarked on a 20-game unbeaten run in all competitions, winning 18 of them.

Pellegrini said: 'That of course will be the best thing we can do, but I think December and this week of November are a decisive month for the Premier League.

'We are going to play eight games of the Premier League, we are going to finish the first round (of fixtures) at the end of December. We have 24 more points to try to win.

'We have to try to do it, I think that is the only way. I think maybe not to be top of the table, because Chelsea are in a very good moment, but I think it is important to have a good first round. That is more than 41 or 42 points.'

Provisional squad: Hart, Caballero, Zabaleta, Sagna, Demichelis, Kompany, Mangala, Boyata, Clichy, Navas, Milner, Nasri, Toure, Fernando, Fernandinho, Lampard, Aguero, Jovetic.
