Two of fiction’s most famous detectives were inspired by a black private eye, it has been claimed.

Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe - portrayed by actor Humphrey Bogart in classic films The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep - were inspired and named after Samuel Marlowe, a historian believes.

Samuel Marlowe was a black detective who investigated society murders and runaway celebrities in Los Angeles in the 1930s - around the time that the two detectives were created in crime novels.

Historian Louise Ransil, a former studio executive, believes Jamaican Samuel Marlowe was the inspiration for the characters created by writers Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler.

According to reports in The Sunday Times and Los Angeles Times, the 61-year-old has made the deduction after examining a box of letters between Samuel Marlowe and the two authors.

Miss Ransil, who has worked on a book and film script about Samuel Marlowe, was transcribing files and letters following his death in 1991 at the age of 100 - but these have since gone missing.

The bizarre twist has left Miss Ransil desperate to find the letters, with the search focused at the moment on a warehouse in southern Los Angeles where they are thought to have been left.

Neither Mr Hammett nor Mr Chandler have ever revealed the origins of their characters’ names.

But it has been claimed in the past that Philip Marlowe’s name came from Marlowe House at Dulwich College in south London, where Mr Chandler was educated.

Samuel Marlowe, a veteran of the First World War, carried out six private investigations in the 1920s which were seen as too dirty or dangerous for white detectives.

At the time Mr Hammett and Mr Chandler were writing short stories for pulp fiction magazine Black Mask - and Samuel Marlowe wrote to them to correct procedural details in these.

He then became friends with Mr Chandler - who hired him as a guide and bodyguard to research areas which were seen as 'off-limits' to white middle-class authors, according to Miss Ransil.

Speaking to The Sunday Times reporter John Harlow, Miss Ransil claimed that Mr Hammett and Samuel Marlowe got on well together.

She said: ‘They were friends who loved laughing together. Hammett calling his detective Sam Spade, a rude but common word for a black person at the time, was a joke between them.’

But Miss Ransil remains annoyed that the papers have been lost - after Samuel Marlowe's house was cleared out by a crew hired by a real estate agent in 2006 following his death 15 years earlier.

Speaking to journalist Daniel Miller for the Los Angeles Times earlier this month, she said: 'It's a long and twisted tale that didn't turn out the way I’d hoped. I'm kicking myself in a lot of ways.'
