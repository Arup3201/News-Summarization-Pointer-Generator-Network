Robin van Persie has reason to be thankful. If Manchester United had not spent more than £150m on new firepower during the summer, he'd be getting slaughtered for his performances right now.

The Dutchman has largely managed to stay under the radar in the opening two months of the campaign despite a series of anonymous, lacklustre displays that perhaps signal the start of a terminal decline.

Inevitably the scrutiny has been on the likes of Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Ander Herrera, the latest batch of expensive acquisitions, rather than those who were already at Old Trafford.

Robin van Persie turned in one of his worst performances in a Man United shirt in the 2-2 draw at West Brom

The Dutchman was ineffective all night and had just one shot on target during his 90 minutes on the pitch

But the focus is slowly shifting. Van Persie barely turned up in United's 2-2 draw at West Bromwich on Monday night and fans and pundits alike are starting to notice.

Deployed as the spearhead of United's attack at The Hawthorns in the absence of the suspended Wayne Rooney and the jet-lagged Radamel Falcao, a sluggish Van Persie took 75 minutes to make an eye-catching contribution.

With instinctive control on the periphery of the box, he unleashed a volley that smacked the base of the post, coming within millimetres of a United equaliser. It was the one glimpse of his best all night. 

In the end, it required Van Persie's compatriot Daley Blind to rescue the team late on and keep the gap to Premier League leaders Chelsea down to a mere 10 points.

For the rest of the match, Van Persie was a shadow of his former self. Absent-minded and ineffective, he roamed around without ever looking like scoring.

It was a final indignity when Falcao, who had arrived back at Carrington two days later than Van Persie having clocked up several thousand more air miles, looked sharper than the Dutchman when he came on.

Sky Sports pundit and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher tweeted that Van Persie, 31, has not been himself for 12 months now and had a point.

On this form, Van Persie, who has just two goals for United so far this season, will lose his place leading United's line when Rooney returns and Falcao fully recovers.

Comparing this point in time over the last couple of seasons and we see the beginnings of decline.

Two years ago to the day, Van Persie scored in a 4-2 home win over Stoke City. It was his eighth goal in a United shirt since joining Sir Alex Ferguson's side from Arsenal.

At this stage last season, he already had seven for United and a further six for his country. This season's return so far has been meagre by comparison and Van Persie is injury-free.

Van Persie's heat map from Monday's  match shows most of his touches came too deep to make an impact

Passes: 24

Passing accuracy: 79.2%

Duels won: 2

Duels lost: 2

Shots on target: 1

Shots off target: 2

Chances created: 1

And his all-round influence is fading too. Against West Brom, Van Persie made just 24 passes, had just one shot on target and set-up just one chance for someone else. In all, United had 22 shots on the Baggies goal.

His heat map from the evening shows his principal contributions came on the halfway line rather than in the penalty box.

It was a shock to discover that he covered 10.93km during the game, second only to Blind and Luke Shaw. It seems most of that running was into the wrong areas.

And it is certainly not the first time this season he has looked invisible in games and it was made worse by the fact he was captain for the night.

When it was announced that Van Gaal was to succeed David Moyes at Old Trafford before the World Cup, the link-up with Van Persie seemed a match made in heaven.

RVP had been heart-broken when Ferguson decided to retire in 2013 but this was going to make up for it.

Van Gaal had taken the player under his wing long ago - his captain for the national team, they enjoyed an almost father-son bond and even went on scouting trips together.

Just look at the joy on Van Gaal's face as Van Persie raced towards him for a high-five following that sensational diving header against Spain at the World Cup, the trigger for a 5-1 rout.

Van Persie's free-scoring exploits for United appear to be on the wane

Those scenes were going to be repeated every week on the Old Trafford touchline.

Perhaps the pressures of a long run in the World Cup are still affecting Van Persie - though he had a very long rest afterwards - or perhaps there is another niggle affecting those ageing legs.

Maybe he is still reeling from being second choice to Rooney last season under Moyes, or from Van Gaal's decision to give the captain's armband to his strike partner.

The arrival of Falcao has maybe knocked his nose out of joint. Whatever the reason or reasons, Van Persie needs to show an urgent improvement in his game.

United have a difficult run of fixtures now in which they play Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal in their next four matches. 

Van Gaal still believes United can make up the 10-point gap to leaders Chelsea and win the title. To have a sniff of a chance, he needs his favourite son to start performing straight away.
