Lee Clark can raise a smile as he imagines the vitriol that is likely to spew his way when Gus Poyet’s side visit St Andrew’s in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night, but there is still sadness at how he left Sunderland in scandal 15 years ago.

‘The tin hat may have to come out that's for sure!’ laughs Clark. ‘I think the fans won't be too complimentary about us. This was always going to be the case after what happened.’

Clark, 41, regrets his actions from earlier in his career and now views it as his responsibility to advice his younger players against making similar mistakes.

Regret: Clark was sad that the t-shirt incident overshadowed the fact he enjoyed a good spell at Sunderland

The Birmingham manager was a player at the Stadium of Light for two years following a controversial £2.5million move in 1997 from his boyhood club Newcastle, where he played more than 200 games.

Having provided a vital contribution from midfield as Peter Reid’s team earned promotion to the Premier League, he then made a very ill-advised decision while watching the 1999 FA Cup final at Wembley with friends from Tyneside.

He pulled on a t-shirt bearing the words ‘Sad Mackem B*******’ in reference to Newcastle’s rivals and his employers. Photographers caught the moment and Clark’ s time on Wearside was over.

Reid sold him to Fulham and Clark, born in Geordie heartland Wallsend, later said he had already been harbouring doubts about playing against Newcastle while wearing the red and white stripes of Sunderland.

Only twice has he encountered Sunderland since, both during the 2005/06 season after he returned to Newcastle for a final campaign. He enjoyed two victories and received a reception he describes as ‘hot, very vocal’ during the 4-1 win at the Stadium of Light. He expects more of the same on Wednesday night in the Birmingham dugout.

‘Being a player at the club and the well-documented incident that made us have to leave probably adds a little bit of spice,’ Clark says. ‘I had two terrific years and that turned sour.

‘I’m now more mature and in a position where I feel it is a regrettable incident. I've had to move on from it.

‘It wasn't as if I was walking round the streets of London, it was just a matter of seconds but you can imagine the amount of camera flashes.

‘I look back on it as stupidity. It's not something you should be doing.

‘The toughest thing for me is everyone forgets the job I did for them as a player. That's the biggest regret. It's difficult for me to ever go and watch a game there like my other clubs.

‘That was my choice but I'm a lot more mature now. I’ve had to pay the consequence of my action. I'd be disappointed if one of my players had done that.

‘I cannot turn back time or change the past but I can affect the future. I'd like to help players in the future.’

He adds: ‘When the draw was made the phone was red hot. Most of it was from the Newcastle end but there are still people I know from Sunderland days so it was a mixture. I don't think I'll be getting involved with anything with the Sunderland fans.

‘It is a special fixture. It’s a Premier League club and we had really good fixtures in this competition against Swansea and Stoke last year.

‘I saw Sunderland against Manchester United and it is a tough game as they looked very good. They could be a decent bet for top half of the Premier League. But I'd love to cause a shock.'
