Secret Tory files about the private lives of MPs are to be opened up for an inquiry into widespread child abuse at the heart of the establishment.

David Cameron has ordered the Conservative Party’s whips’ office to hand over any evidence to investigators trying to uncover historic child abuse in Westminster.

It comes after the extraordinary revelation that the government of former Prime Minister Edward Heath could cover up scandals involving MPs and ‘small boys’ in return for loyalty.

Tim Fortescue revealed how the whip’s office, which rules over MPs for the party leadership, would try to ‘get a chap out of trouble’ in return for loyalty. He served as a whip between 1970 and 1973.

Mr Heath himself pioneered the keeping of a ‘dirt book’ about MPs' private lives to turn to his political advantage.

Mr Fortescue made the extraordinary comments in a 1995 documentary for the BBC, entitled Westminster's Secret Service. 

The former Tory MP, who died aged 92 in 2008, claimed he could help MPs with scandals 'involving small boys' in order to exert control over them to make sure they vote in line with their party's intentions.

Mr Fortescue said: ‘For anyone with any sense, who was in trouble, would come to the whips and tell them the truth, and say now, 'I'm in a jam, can you help?'.

‘It might be debt, it might be... a scandal involving small boys, or any kind of scandal in which... a member seemed likely to be mixed up in, they'd come and ask if we could help and if we could, we did.

‘And we would do everything we can because we would store up brownie points... and if I mean, that sounds a pretty, pretty nasty reason, but it's one of the reasons because if we could get a chap out of trouble then, he will do as we ask forever more.’

The Prime Minister has now written to Home Secretary Theresa May informing her that the Tory Party had to ‘co-operate fully’ with the Home Office’s inquiry into child sexual abuse.

It means the ‘dirt books’ will be scrutinised by Home Office officials.

They are not household names, but whips wield extraordinary power in the shadows of Westminster. 

They are charged with ensuring party members turn out for votes, and vote the way their party wants. 

One way to encourage loyalty  is to help them when they get into trouble, and keeping it secret.

Before becoming Prime Minister, Edward Heath was Tory chief whip from 1956 to 1959.

During this time he gathered information, gossip and intrigue about every member of the party, and used it to his advantage.

The file became known as the 'dirt book', and successive administrations have used the same tactic to keep MPs in line, covering everything from teenage misdemeanours and extra-marital affairs to allegations of law-breaking. 

Mr Heath once said: ‘I acted on the principle that the more you know about the people you are speaking for, and the more they know about you and what you are being asked to do, the better.’

Mr Cameron’s decision came in a response to a letter from the campaigning Labour MP John Mann, the Telegraph reported this morning. 

In it he urged party leaders to ‘put all other considerations aside and urgently uncover and pass on any information relating to child abuse in your political party.

He wrote: ‘In particular every living Whip needs to be questioned by their party on any evidence or rumours that were circulating at the time.’

In his reply Mr Cameron said: ‘The Conservative Whip’s Office and our Party headquarters will co-operate fully with the inquiry and I have written to the Home Secretary to make this clear.

‘Of course, any information regarding potential criminal activity of any nature – past or present – should always be passed to the Police without delay.’ 

Mr Fortescue's damning revelations were first raised in the Commons by the Labour MP Lisa Nandy last year.

She said Mr Fortescue’s interview was ‘just one powerful example of how personal and political interests can conspire to prevent justice from happening’.

Miss Nandy called for the child abuse inquiry to consider ‘not just the police and social services but will also look at what happens at the heart of power’.

She added: ‘If those systems are found to exist today, [they must] be overturned, whether that makes life uncomfortable for political parties, whether it makes life uncomfortable for Parliament, or whether it makes life uncomfortable for the Government itself.’

Tory Mark Reckless also asked if the inquiry would ‘consider any allegations or evidence held by the whips’.

Mrs May, the Home Secretary, insisted no part of society would be off limits in the inquiry. ‘It is not my intention that political parties should be outside the scope of the inquiry,’ she said.

‘I think this has to be wide-ranging, it has to look at every area where it is possible that people have been guilty of abuse and we need to learn lessons to ensure that the systems we have in place are able to identify that and deal with it appropriately.’

Mr Fortescue was a Tory whip in the Edward Heath's government between 1970 and 1973

She stressed that the inquiry panel will not be investigating specific allegations, which would be a matter for the police.

‘It is looking across the board at the way things have been approached in the past and asking that question as to whether, and I expect to draw this quite widely, people did have in place the proper protections for children or not and if not, what are the gaps, are those gaps still existing today, and what do we need to do to make sure that those gaps are filled?'

‘I would expect that as much information as possible is given to the panel to enable them to do that.’

Whistelblower Peter McKelvie has claimed a 'powerful elite' of at least 20 prominent establishment figures formed a VIP paedophile ring that abused children for decades.

The former child protection officer first raised the alarm about high profile individuals engaged in child sex abuse.
