One of the brightest young managers in English football isn’t sure how many GCSEs he’s got, except to say ‘not many’. But when it comes to learning on the job, Karl Robinson has acquired enough to fill a few textbooks.

‘I’ll need them for this game,’ he told Sportsmail. Manchester United are in town, a brand that Robinson compares to Coca Cola up against one a touch smaller and more maligned. A manager of great achievements and arrogance is going up against a man 30 years his junior, who tends to think like someone a little older.

‘One thing that gets me is players wearing headphones when they come off the coach,’ Robinson said. ‘I’ve stopped that here.

‘I find it disrespectful. If a man worked hard all week, bought a ticket and comes to watch us with his kid, you show them respect. Look at them and say “hello”, sign an autograph. That’ll make a kid’s day and then his dad is happy too.

‘I can sound like a 40 or 50-year-old man, but things like that mean a lot to me.’

In fact, Robinson is 33, possibly one of the oldest 33 year olds in football. In the years since his playing days ended as a teenager with an injured back, he has crammed a fair bit in, from coaching at Steve Heighway’s Liverpool’s academy, to working under Paul Ince and Sam Allardyce.

He is victim to pranks from Robbie Fowler, calls in Ian Wright occasionally for striker sessions – ‘I need top players beside me because I can’t talk to a player about the Premier League because I didn’t do it’ – and in all has managed more than 200 games.

This is his biggest opponent, though, and the latest chance to learn something. ‘Believe me, I’d love to have a chat to Louis van Gaal,’ he said.

‘I love Dutch football. After a game on a Saturday I love to jump on the Eurostar. I’ll go to Belgium, France, Holland.

'I’ll go to watch Excelsior, Brugges, Lille, anything. It’s a chance to take in another culture, another system, a way of doing things.

Dutch master: Louis van Gaal's Manchester United side have failed to impress in their first games of season

‘Look at what Van Gaal did at Ajax. I’m enthralled by how Dutch clubs have a connection through the age groups.

‘Here, I have a numerical system. All MK Dons No 8s through the age range will look the same, all No 6s will drop into the same places. They do that in Holland, at Ajax. It is very Dutch.

‘I’d very much hope to get a chance to talk to Louis van Gaal. People say Manchester United are vulnerable. Come on, it’s Manchester United.

‘But we are going to give our best. Steve Heighway used to tell me that failure is not trying. He helped give me standards and those standards run through this club.’

Beyond Robinson’s father, who made his Liverpool-supporting son clap off Arsenal after they won the 1989 title on the final day at Anfield, Heighway was his first major mentor.

‘It’s ridiculous that Steve has not been utilised more in the game,’ he said. ‘I remember him doing a crossing session at Liverpool. He was stood out wide and getting the players to pass to him. A kid rolled him the ball and he smashed it back. “This is Liverpool, I was an international and so are the rest of the team you’ll be playing with. Do it properly”.

‘The kid was about 12. Steve got messages into people, including me. I have been so lucky to learn from the people I have. I went from Liverpool to here to coach with Paul Ince. He would park his car and race me to the building.

‘His self-drive was incredible. He made me want to be better every day. We went to Blackburn and I can tell you no-one knows more than Paul about players – in my phone he is “Gaffer”. It’s mad that Paul is not working.

‘When he left Blackburn and Sam Allardyce came in, I remember thinking I’d be going too. I was on the M62 and the phone rings, withheld number. Here we go.

‘I heard, “Karl, it’s Sam. It went on for 15 minutes. I am answering in my poshest Scouse voice. Then he started laughing. It was Robbie Fowler.

‘I put the phone down, 15 minutes later it goes again. “Karl, it’s Sam”. I can't tell you what I said. But it was Sam and he wanted me to stay. I learnt from him every day as well. No-one would do a better job of keeping you in the Premier League. He’s in my phone as Sam Algaffer.’ 

Ready to do battle: Robinson stands by the pitch at Stadium mk ahead of Tuesday night's Capital One Cup game

Expecting more: Van Gaal will want an improved performance from his United side against MK Dons 

After reuniting with Ince at MK Dons, he was appointed manager in 2010, aged 29. He’s done well, twice delivering play-off places and a cup run every year. His thoughts have been sought by Gareth Southgate at the FA and his success is slowly helping the image of the club.

‘I have always operated with an understanding of the cloud we are under,’ he said. ‘I made a point of learning it all - I know the club’s history.’

Whatever happens in Tuesday night's test against Van Gaal, he has already made a pleasant addition.
