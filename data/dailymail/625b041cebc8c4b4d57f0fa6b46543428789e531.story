Gymnastics coach Bob Bellew walked free from court after he 
admitted a string of sexual abuse charges, spanning 40 years, against 
girls he was tutoring. Now the CPS is planning to appeal the sentence

Victims of a paedophile gymnastics coach who abused performers as young as six over a 40 year period have spoken of their disgust after he was spared jail.

Bob Bellew, 66, admitted abusing girls in his charge during practise sessions at schools and gyms across the country, but was given a suspended prison sentence earlier this month after a judge said he had shown remorse.

Now the Crown Prosecution Service backed by victims and police who investigated the crimes have begun proceedings to appeal the 'lenient' sentence, after those affected have spoken of its impact.

One witness in the case who was not called after Bellew admitted his campaign of abuse said she could not believe the judge had effectively 'let off' the sex offender.

The woman, who asked not to be named but was a member of one of Bellew's gym clubs, said: 'For the judge to say he had shown remorse was just wrong. He didn't show remorse. He foiled the judge completely.

'If you abuse people for 40 years, you don't care what you are doing. I was disappointed that he took into account what he had been through since. It was like they did not take into account the victims at all.'

Internationally renowned Bellew, 66, has published books on gymnastics, taught at schools across the UK and was a former Community Coach of the Year.

He also served on committees planning the 2012 Olympics and was chief coach of the Tower Hamlets Schools gym and dance display team.

Bellew was also awarded the 'Order of the Smile', a UN-recognised citation for adults 'distinguished in their love, care and aid of children'.

But he admitted a string of sexual abuse charges, spanning 40 years, against girls he was tutoring.

He was spared jail at Snaresbrook Crown Court by a judge who said he had demonstrated 'genuine remorse'.

A CPS spokesman said: 'Under the Unduly Lenient Sentence Scheme the CPS has referred the sentence in the case of Robert Bellew to the Attorney General for him to consider.

'The Attorney General will now decide if this is an appropriate case for him to make an application to the Court of Appeal asking that the Court consider whether this sentence was unduly lenient'.

Bellew's outraged victims slammed the justice system in a statement after he was handed the suspended sentence.

They said: 'This sentence says you are allowed to go into a primary school and touch young girls and you will not be punished for it.

'This shows everything that is wrong with the British justice system. He has had to live with this for two or three years, but the victims have had it hanging over them their whole lives.'

Bellew, who shook uncontrollably throughout the hearing, admitted touching three children while working at a south London primary school in the 1970s.

He offered help to three of them with groin injuries, and after removing their clothes he groped them.

He touched the daughter of a friend after offering her private tutoring, and another had her thigh stroked when she was invited to his home.

Judge Joanna Korner handed Bellew a 15-month sentence, suspended for two years, at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured)

He also admitted touching two teenagers in offences between 1998 and 2004, on the pretext of helping them perform a routine.

Judge Joanna Korner handed Bellew a 
15-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and banned him from 
working with children.

She said: 'These were not specimens of a course of conduct, but actually single offences which you engaged against these girls.

'It does seem to me that this is a 
case where the punishment has in effect already begun, in the effect 
this had on you, for the loss of your standing and the strain of waiting
 to find out what would happen.

Mercy: Judge Joanna Korner said Bellew had shown remorse even though he blamed victims when questioned for a report

'Accordingly, I have come to the conclusion that this is one of the cases where punishment may be tempered with mercy.'

After denying the claims for months, 
Bellew suddenly came clean, pleading guilty to eight of 17 charges just 
two weeks before he was due to stand trial.

Bellew, from New Cross, south east London, admitted seven counts of indecent assault and one of sexual touching.

A further nine charges were left to lie on the court file.

In a joint statement some of Bellew's 
victims who attended court said: 'You get six months in prison for 
taking your husband’s speeding points, but you’re allowed to touch a 
child under their clothes and you get a suspended sentence.'

When asked if they believed his remorse was genuine they said: 'He 
stopped shaking soon enough when he realised he wasn't going to prison.'

Another victim said this week: 'I was pleased when he admitted it but when he pleaded guilty his supporters said he only did it to get a shorter sentence and they still don't believe that he committed these crimes.

'What Bellew did was a lot worse than the sentence suggests and he should go to jail for what he's done, he should go to jail for at least two years looking at what other people have been sentenced to for similar offences.

'When he walked into court I cried. He looked like he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown, he was shaking. As soon as they told him he was not going to jail he stopped shaking. It was all an act, definitely.

'I'm pleased that the sentence is being appealed. I want him to go to jail for what he's done. I just want it to be over now.'

In a probation report Bellew backed down from his admissions, denying the touching was sexual and passing the blame onto his victims

Describing the impact on the victims, prosecutor Rekha Kodikara said: 
'One of the victims from the 1970s had excelled in sport, and it had 
become for her a place of sanctuary where she felt she could express 
herself.

'She said Mr Bellew destroyed that place by what he did. Since that 
incident, and over the years since she has felt unable to trust people 
in positions of authority.

'The impact of that breach of trust has dogged her for years, she says 
she does not trust easily, does not let people into her circle, and it 
has seriously affected her marriage and her relationship with her 
children.'

She described two sets of allegations, the first in the 1970s, and the second in the 1990s and early 2000s.

She said: 'The offences would not have occurred but for the position of 
trust held by the defendant as a gymnastics coach, which gave him access
 to the victims who were young and therefore vulnerable.'

Bellew  was due to stand trial in September after pleading not guilty to a number of offences in April last year.

However, the second set of allegations came to light after the victims 
read news reports of the pending court case and contacted police.

Bellew admitted eight of 17 charges against him, involving seven victims as young as six years old.

However in a probation report he backed down from his admissions, 
denying the touching was sexual and passing the blame onto his victims.

His lawyer Barry Kogan said: 'He has had great difficulty coming to 
terms with the shame of what he has done, and this is demonstrated by 
what he has told the probation officer, trying to deny his actions, pass
 them off as inappropriate not sexual, and blame the victims.'

But he said his client's remorse was 'genuine', and asked the judge to ignore the comments in the report.

Sentencing him, the judge said: 'You were one of the most highly 
regarded gym coaches in this country and much of your life has been 
spent doing good to others in particular young people.

'At the same time, for the seven young women, who at the time were 
primary school children who had come to you for coaching on the basis of
 your reputation and the work you had done, for them you were anything 
but a good influence.

'It is clear that the effect of what you did has followed at the very least three of your victims throught their adult lives.'

Detective Constable Lewi Fenton, of the Metropolitan Police Service 
Child Abuse Investigation Team, said: 'I was shocked at the sentence and
 I don't think it will bring closure to the because I saw how upset they
 were.

'We must pay tribute to Bellew’s victims who had the courage to come forward.

'His abuse has affected them into their adult lives.

'Bellew taught at schools across the capital, and it is possible that he abused other victims who have not yet come forward.

'We would urge anyone who was assaulted by him to contact their local 
police station in the first instance. The MPS can be reached on 101.'
