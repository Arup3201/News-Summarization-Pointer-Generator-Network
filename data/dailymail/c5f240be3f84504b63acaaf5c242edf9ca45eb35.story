As one of the most beguiling characters in English literature, Elizabeth Bennet has been described as high-spirited and honest to a fault.

Little wonder, then, that the Duchess of Cornwall has admitted she rather admires the Pride And Prejudice heroine.

Asked yesterday which storybook character she would like to be, Camilla initially gave the odd response of Winnie The Pooh.

Her reason soon became clear, however, as she explained: ‘I would love to have my fingers stuck in honey’.

She then revealed that her all-time heroine is Jane Austen’s feisty Lizzy, who defies social conventions – and her own prejudice – to fall in love with the proud Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy.

The only question is whether Prince Charles would be her Darcy? 

In an interview to be published tomorrow with First News, the children’s newspaper, she also lists Dickens’ A Tale Of Two Cities as her favourite ‘grown-up book’ and says she feasted on classics such as The Wind In The Willows, Pippi Longstocking and Treasure Island as a child.

But she only revealed her admiration for the spirited Lizzy, seen left as played by Keira Knightley in a 2005 film adaptation of Pride And Prejudice, after first saying she would most like to be Winnie The Pooh, right

The Duchess unveiled the newspaper’s new London office yesterday, and enjoyed a tour of the newsroom with 11-year-old reporter Chloe Miller.
