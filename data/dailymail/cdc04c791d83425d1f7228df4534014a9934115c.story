Defending Premier League champions Manchester City have been building up their training after the international break ahead of their clash with title rivals Arsenal on Saturday.

Manuel Pellegrini’s side visit the Emirates Stadium this weekend looking to respond to their shock 1-0 loss at home to Stoke at the end of last month.

However captain Vincent Kompany didn’t appear to be in the best of moods at training as the squad were set a series of press ups.

Kompany was a surprise starter for Belgium in their 2-0 friendly victory over Australia in Liege last week having missed their final training session with a calf problem, so perhaps the centre-back was struggling with the pace.

City will be hoping their captain is fit enough and could bring in their selection of summer signings to pick up three points at Arsenal on Saturday.

The Premier League champions brought in the likes of Eliquiam Mangala, Fernando and Willy Cabellero as well as signing free agents Frank Lampard and Bacary Sagna in the transfer window.

Pellegrini’s side drew 1-1 on their league visit to the Emirates last season but will be looking for revenge for the 3-0 loss to Arsene Wenger’s side in the Community Shied back in August.
