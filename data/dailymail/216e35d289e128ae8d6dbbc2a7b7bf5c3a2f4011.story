An Austrian woman is facing a firing squad in Indonesia after being found with 6.6lbs of crystal meth in her suitcase.

Blonde dancer and charity worker Susanne Mayr claims she was conned by a talent scout who promised her fame, but instead planted the drugs in the lining of her suitcase.

The baby-faced 29-year-old was on an all-expenses paid performance trip to South Africa when her 'manager' sent her to Indonesia for work.

Ms Mayr claims she was given a new suitcase by the talent scout and that she had no idea the crystal meth was inside the lining of the bag.

Speaking at the family home in Baden, in Lower Austria, her mother Ingeborg said: ‘She had connections with various people in Africa because she worked at supporting a school project down there and money she earned from her dancing used to be sent there.

'She had even visited the region, and had always dreamed of being able to get work down there so was really happy when she was spotted by the talent scout on YouTube who contacted her over the Internet and offered her a job.

‘She performed under the name Young Bebe and had quite a following, and in November she set off for her new life.

'When she was in South Africa she performed a few times but then her manager told her that he had some work for her Indonesia but that she would have to get nicer luggage and he took it to a shop where they purchased a new suitcase.'

Ingeborg adds: ‘But it was part of a con and the case actually had a fake lining with the drugs hidden inside. She called me from jail to tell me about what had happened, she told me: "Mummy, you've got to help me. They're going to shoot me".'

Austrian officials have confirmed they are paying the estimated $50,000 in legal fees to try and argue the young woman's case.

Drug smuggling is regarded as a serious offence in Indonedia and with over 3kg (6.6lbs) of crystal meth in the case, it is enough to earn Ms Mayr the death penalty if she is convicted.

She has reportedly cooperated with officials, but should she be convicted, it is likely that the volume of drugs will weigh heavily in favour of a death sentence.

Customs officials in the country believe the case may be connected to a second drug smuggler, a German man, who was also caught a few days later in November at Jakarta's international airport where he had flew into from Senegal.

The German, 49, was caught carrying 4.15 kilograms of the same crystal methamphetamine drug.

‘The methamphetamines were hidden in the lining of his luggage. They have a street value of 475,104 dollars,’ said airport customers chief Okto Irianto.
