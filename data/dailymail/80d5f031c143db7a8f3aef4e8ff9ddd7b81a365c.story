A 22-month old girl with a rare condition is recovering from a £60,000 life-changing operation to fit a bionic hearing aid inside her skull.

It was a race against time for little Evie Small who was flown to Italy for the surgery which will finally give her the chance to hear and speak.

She is completely deaf but it is hoped she will soon be able to hear her parents tell her they love her for the first time.

Evie has the rare Goldenhar syndrome which means she has no hearing, facial or balance nerves

The youngster has the rare Goldenhar syndrome which means she has no hearing, facial or balance nerves.

Her lawyer parents David and Emily needed to raise £60,000 for the operation by the world's top specialist surgeon, Professor Vittorio Colletti.

They have raised almost half the money and although the operation was completed last week they have 18 months to raise the rest.

When Prof Colletti first saw Evie, he told the family 'this little girl needs operating on by the end of June, it's no concern to me when you can pay'.

The complex operation involved 
fitting an Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI) and Prof Colletti is widely 
regarded as the world's best in this field.

It
is believed no UK hospital has ever dealt with someone suffering from 
Goldenhar syndrome - while Colletti has now treated seven sufferers.

Despite
a day in intensive care following the six-hour op, Evie is smiling and 
laughing again with her parents at her hospital bedside in Verona, 
Italy.

Mr Small, 42, a solicitor from Horndean near Portsmouth, Hants, said: 'I tell my little girl every day how much I love her but she has never once heard me.

'This is why we wanted to take her to the best surgeon in the world to give her the best possible treatment.

'The operation then went very well for her but it was a stressful time for us.

'Dr Colletti said that of the 12 electrodes on the paddle on her brain 10 of them are working already.

'Over the next few months we need that to build up to 12. He described her as an amazing little lady. She is still quite weak but her spirit is strong.

'They will now wait four weeks to allow the brain bruising and swelling to go down before they actually switch on the ABI.'

Surgeons from across the globe were flown in to watch Evie's operation being performed - and many other surgeons watched it via a live video link.

There were five other children - from Ecuador, America, Britain and Poland - having the same treatment from Prof Colletti.

Mr Small added: 'We've all become firm friends as we're in the same boat.

'Mr Coletti has said his aim is to get all of the five children speaking on the phone within five years as that is of course the ultimate test.

'The support with donations has been overwhelming and amazing - one 93 year old man sent a cheque saying he understands what it is like to be deaf.'

The extremely rare condition is thought to affect one in every 500,000 children born.

Mr and Mrs Small, a 37 year old solicitor, are balancing being at Evie's side in Italy with flying back and forth to England to look after their four other children.
