Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev faces up to seven years in jail after being charged yesterday with ‘hooliganism’ over a televised punch-up.

Moscow prosecutors launched a criminal investigation against Mr Lebedev, whose family backs the Independent and London Evening Standard newspapers, after he threw a punch at a property developer during a prime-time talk show.

The 52-year-old media tycoon – who also co-owns Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s main pro-democracy paper, and is a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin – faces the same draconian charges that resulted in members of female punk group Pussy Riot being jailed, prompting global outrage.

The anti-corruption crusader and 
staunch defender of a free press believes he is being punished by the 
Kremlin for political reasons.

Friends of Mr Lebedev say he has been 
subjected to a campaign of harassment, with offices raided by scores of 
investigators, prospective business partners warned off and smears about
 his private life posted on the internet.

The billionaire claims the case against him is a vendetta by President Vladimir Putin (pictured)

His son Evgeny, owner of the British 
newspapers, writing on Twitter, said: ‘He is being targeted by people 
who don’t like his stance against corruption, and hate Novaya [Gazeta].

‘I don’t condone violence, but the 
punishment does not fit the crime here. We need more Russians to speak 
out against injustice, not fewer. I hope this isn’t the start of a new 
crackdown.’

He later said: ‘This is an extraordinarily disproportionate response to what happened in a TV studio many months ago.

‘My father has been targeted because 
of his determination to fight against corruption and to be a crusader 
for democracy in a country where this has not always been welcome. My 
father has spent his life trying to promote freedom of expression and 
justice in his fight against corruption in Russia.

‘I hope that common sense prevails and
 that these excessive charges are dropped. I really hope that this does 
not presage a new phase of crackdowns on those who speak out against 
injustice.’

Mr Lebedev, reported by Forbes 
magazine to be worth $1.1billion, knocked Sergei Polonsky to the floor 
during a televised debate on Russian TV last September.

Mr Polonsky told him during the show about the global financial crisis that he would like to ‘punch someone’s lights out’.

Mr Lebedev later said: ‘I don’t regret
 hitting him. As far as I am concerned, I had to act as he had been 
aggressive throughout the show and had made threats.

studio guest with Sergei Polonsky, right, but the discussion soon boiled
 over into violence

Taking a stand: Lebedev has had enough and looms threateningly over Polonsky

‘Anyone in my position would have done the same – in fact, I showed restraint.  

‘The only thing I regret is that people might now perceive me as a violent person, which I am absolutely not.’

The media magnate and his close 
friend, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, own a 49 per cent stake 
in Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s main opposition newspaper. Its relentless 
criticism of the Kremlin, and its investigations into official 
corruption have put many of its journalists in danger.

Four Novaya reporters have been killed
 since 2000, including Anna Politkovskaya, a fierce critic of the 
Kremlin and its policies in Chechnya, who was gunned down in the 
elevator of her Moscow apartment building in 2006. Others have been 
harassed and attacked.

Mr Lebedev was charged with 
hooliganism and assault ‘motivated by political, ideological, racial, 
national or religious hatred, or hatred of a particular social group.’

Last month, writing in The Mail on 
Sunday, he said: ‘I have been the subject of several criminal 
investigations after allegations made against me, including one of money
 laundering and one of harassment.

‘I have no doubt these were a direct 
result of my part ownership of the leading opposition newspaper in 
Russia, Novaya Gazeta, which has published many stories about abuses of 
power within Putin’s government.’

'Anyone in my position would have done the same – in fact, I showed restraint. The only thing I regret is that people might now perceive me as a violent person, which I am absolutely not'

Alexander Lebedev

In the same article, Mr Lebedev urged 
Mr Putin to pardon the three members of the Pussy Riot band – jailed for
 two years for their anti-government performance in a Moscow cathedral –
 and totally reform the Russian justice system.

Mr Lebedev described the band’s 
treatment as ‘just one of many examples of politically-motivated abuses 
of the criminal justice system’, adding: ‘This means that those who, 
like me, are viewed as opposing the government, often find themselves 
enmeshed in ludicrous accusations.’

He predicted his imminent legal 
problems in an interview in Moscow on Tuesday, saying: ‘I know the 
position of the president. He thinks it is true that if you have been 
funding (the opposition), so I was violating rule No 1 – if you have 
money you should not interfere ( in politics).

Asked if he thought he would be 
jailed, he replied: ‘I don’t see any reason for anybody fabricating a 
case like that unless they want to put you in prison.’
