Yaya Toure still seems to be nursing a niggling thigh injury that threatens to undermine his World Cup this month.

The Manchester City midfielder had been receiving treatment in Qatar for an unspecified injury before joining up with his Ivory Coast team-mates at their training camp in the United States.

He is the only one of the 23 players named in the squad by coach Sabri Lamouchi to miss the start of World Cup preparations in Dallas, and was spotted wincing slightly on Wednesday afternoon.

The 
midfielder flew to the US last week to join up with his colleagues but 
didn't play in their defeat against Bosnia on Friday.

The Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital in Doha confirmed the African Footballer of the Year’s admission for what it called, in a statement, a 'minor injury' a fortnight ago.

Toure had suffered a thigh injury in mid-April but returned after two weeks to help City secure the Premier League title.

On the last day of the season on May 11 he went off in the second half with a reported hamstring injury as City beat West Ham.

Toure’s build-up to the June and July finals in Brazil has been overshadowed by comments from his agent Dimitri Seluk who said the midfielder was upset with City after an apparent birthday snub and could leave the English champions.

The Ivorians play El Salvador in Dallas on Wednesday before arriving in Brazil on Friday.

They have been drawn in Group C and compete against Colombia, Greece and Japan.
