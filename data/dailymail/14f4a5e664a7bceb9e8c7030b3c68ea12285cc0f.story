All teenagers should receive a school leaving certificate which details their extra-curricular activities and employability skills, according to a government-backed report.

The certificate would show that pupils – rather than just graduating from ‘exam factories’ – have developed traits such as perseverance, self-control and the ability to bounce back from setbacks.

The development of children’s ‘character and resilience’ is so crucial that teachers should be made to organise after school clubs.

The recommendations are contained in a report from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility and the CentreForum think-tank.

Recommendations: Pupils should receive a certificate listing all their extra-curricular activities and employability skills, according to a new report

Its ‘character and resilience manifesto’ has been supported by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg as well as the Confederation of British Industry.

It cites a network of public charter schools  – those which are publicly funded but operate independently – in the United States called KIPP (Knowledge Is Power Program) which gives pupils ‘character growth cards’.

A certificate for teenagers in this 
country – to sit alongside raw exam results – could ‘explicitly break 
down and reference particular character and resilience competencies 
drawing on the model of the KIPP report card’, according to the report.

The majority of state schools are still failing to push disadvantaged bright students towards top universities, says a government commissioned report.

Some teachers are reluctant to put too much emphasis on applying to the Russell Group  – which includes Oxford and Cambridge – because they do not want to be seen as elitist.

Many students also view Oxbridge as ‘posh’, says the Institute for Policy Studies in Education and social research agency TNS BMRB.

Taking part in extra-curricular activities, which help build pupils’ character, should also be made a more central aspect of a school’s purpose and a teacher’s job. The report adds: ‘This additional responsibility would either need to be met by a corresponding financial reward/incentive or by schools allowing more time for these activities within the regular school day.’

Ofsted should assess the ‘extent and quality’ of extra-curricular activities and how ‘soft skills’ are incorporated into lessons.

In a foreword to the report, Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Claire Tyler said: ‘The APPG on Social Mobility believes that if our education system also focused more on these so-called soft skills, young people would leave school and university much better equipped to face life.

‘Indeed, even talking about “soft skills” is something of a misnomer because these aren’t fluffy or superficial skills we’re talking about – this is about having the fundamental drive, tenacity and perseverance needed to make the most of opportunities.’

John Cridland, director general of the CBI, said: ‘As this important report shows, alongside academic rigour, we also need schools to produce rounded and grounded young people who have the skills and behaviours that businesses want.’
