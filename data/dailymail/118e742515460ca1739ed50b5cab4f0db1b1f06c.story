Rickie Lambert has summed up his World Cup journey to Brazil with England - describing it as the 'best' and the 'worst' experience of his career.

The striker, who signed for boyhood club Liverpool this summer, completed a fairytale journey from working in a beetroot factory 13 years ago to representing his nation at the World Cup in 2014 when he came on a substitute during the 2-1 defeat to Uruguay.

But England's earliest exit from a World Cup since 1958 means that the experience has also been a painful one for the 32-year-old.

High and low: Lambert has loved playing at a World Cup but England's early exit leaves a bitter taste

Frustration: Lambert says that the mood in the England camp is not good following their early exit

England's only remaining fixture is Tuesday's dead rubber with Costa Rica and, although Lambert will hope to feature, he did not expect to be leaving Brazil after only three matches.

'It’s a difficult scenario to be in, everyone’s disappointed about what’s happened and the fact that we’ve got one more game left.

'But we’ve got to be professional and we’ve got to give our best and get three points to finish on a high against Costa Rica.

'It’s been the best experience of my career and probably the worst experience at the same time.

'It’s always difficult being an England fan and getting knocked out, but this time being involved is devastating to get knocked out at an early stage.

'It was probably the worst moment of my career when the final whistle went and we were knocked out of the World Cup.

'It was horrible. Maybe I might look back in years to come and think "I’ve played in a World Cup", that will live with me forever. But I can’t remember any moments that are as bad as that.'

Fairytale: Lambert completed a dream move to boyhood club Liverpool this summer before flying to Brazil

Form: The 32-year-old enjoyed a fantastic season for Southampton, leading to his England call-up

Despite their premature exit, Lambert is fully supportive of England manager Roy Hodgson and thinks he should lead the country to the 2016 Euros in France.

Lambert, who played in three separate divisions for Southampton before signing for Liverpool, is especially encouraged by Hodgson's decision to blood youngsters in Brazil.

He told www.thefa.com: 'One thing is very important - we don’t make any knee-jerk decisions.

'I think the set-up we have, the manager who is in charge is definitely the person we need to go forward with the group of young kids coming through.

'The progression they have had under Roy has been amazing, so if he can keep the group together for another two years it’s going to be exciting and they are going to learn after what has just happened.

Meteoric rise: Lambert played for Southampton in three different divisions and score in all of them

All alone: Roy Hodgson should remain as England manager despite their early exit, says Rickie Lambert

'Roy has given the young players a chance and they have thrived on it.

'That’s definitely one of the positives we’ll take out of the World Cup and when the next scenario comes around in the next two years at the Euros, this is going to help them.

'That’s why this set-up needs to stay together.'
