Steph McGovern, 32, from Middlesbrough, was sent the money along with a letter from someone who said they were 'sorry' for the way she spoke

A BBC Breakfast presenter was sent £20 by a viewer who described her northern accent as 'a terrible affliction'.

Steph McGovern, 32, who is originally from Middlesbrough, was sent the money along with a letter from someone who said they were 'sorry' for the way she spoke.

The business editor, who appears regularly on the morning programme, was told she should use the money for 'correction therapy'.

She also revealed that she thinks people 'underestimate' her because of her accent.

Speaking to the Daily Express, Miss McGovern said that she received mixed reviews from viewers when she first appeared on screen.

She explained that while some said they were glad to see a 'normal person' on television, others attacked her for the way she spoke.

She said: 'People were coming up to me in the street going, "I can’t believe they’ve put you on telly!" – for both good reasons and bad.

'I got one letter that politely said, "Dear Ms McGovern, I watched you on BBC Breakfast. I’m sorry about your terrible affliction. Here’s £20 towards correction therapy." The affliction they were talking about was my accent.'

She added: 'I think people tend to underestimate you when you have a northern accent, for instance if you have to talk to the CEO of an international company. 

'But then when I’m talking to someone in a factory, it’s just like being with my mum’s mates.'

The presenter's first job at the BBC was as a part-time researcher on now-defunct technology programme Tomorrow's World, which she did while studying science at University College London.

The former champion Irish dancer soon became a financial news producer on the Today programme on Radio 4, and has also worked on BBC One news bulletins, Radio 2 and Radio Five Live.

She first presented on BBC Breakfast in August 2012, and is one of the show's main relief presenters, presenting over Christmas 2012.

It is not the first time Miss McGovern has spoken out about the criticism she receives for her accent. 

Last year she admitted that she encountered prejudice from BBC bosses before she landed her on-screen role.

She told the Radio Times that, despite being a business journalist at the BBC for more than 10 years, there were still some within the Corporation who thought she was 'too common for telly'. 

She said: ‘I remember at the end of one BBC job interview being told by the manager, “I didn't realise people like you were clever”. Sad, but true.’

The presenter added: ‘You would think that after nearly two years in the job, people would be used to my Teesside tones.

'To be fair most are, but there are still some viewers who can't accept that someone with my accent can have a brain. It means that I regularly get abuse about it.'

Wrong accent? Former Today programme presenter Edward Stourton was forced out of his job amid suggestions his accent was 'too posh'

In the 1950s, having a 'BBC accent' meant that you spoke RP, or the Queen's English, without a trace of a regional accent.

More recently, however, speaking this way could do you out of a job at the corporation.

In 2008 BBC Radio 4 Today presenter Edward Stourton was sacked by the BBC amid suggestions he sounded 'too posh'.

Embarrassed executives insisted that the hugely experienced presenter, who was educated at Ampleforth and Cambridge, and who presented the flagship news programme for a decade, was leaving to 'pursue other projects' and that modern listeners wanted a 'more light-hearted' style of presenting.

However Stourton disputed this, saying: 'I am leaving because they have removed me and there are no other projects.'  He went on to present The World At One and The World This Weekend as well as Sunday, R4's main religious and current affairs news programme.

In 2010 the BBC nailed its colours to the mast when Jana Bennett, director of BBC Vision, said the corporation needed to 'increase the amount of network TV content which offers distinctive voices with an authentic sense of place.'

She said more work should be done to ensure the BBC's output accurately reflected the UK's nations and regions, but insisted 'accents on their own' were not enough to make people from different parts of the UK feel represented.

The following year the BBC Trust said that R4 should 'give greater exposure to presenters from the North'.
