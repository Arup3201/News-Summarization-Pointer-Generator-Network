A Lowry painting of London's bustling Piccadilly Circus could fetch up to £6million when it goes under the hammer for the first time.

The artwork, which dates back to 1960, was part of hotel Tycoon Lord Forte's collection for almost three decades, and has never before been auctioned.

It depicts the junction's famous fountain, topped by the iconic statue of Eros, in a different spot to its present location, amid a throng of red buses and scurrying figures.

High expectations: This JS Lowry painting of London's bustling Piccadilly Circus is estimated to reach between £4million to £6million at auction

The painting heads a list of 14 Lowry 
works from the late Lord Forte's collection, most of which had been in 
his hands for decades.

LS 
Lowry is most famous for the matchstick figures he painted against a 
backdrop of northern mill towns. But he painted two images of Piccadilly
Circus, just months apart.

The earlier one - measuring 20in by 24in - set a new record price for the artist in 1998, fetching £562,500.

The
painting from Lord Forte's collection - party of what is claimed to be 
the most important group of Lowry works to come to auction - is 30 x 40.

It goes under the hammer at Christie's, the London auctioneers, next month and is estimated to reach between £4million and £6million.

If it fetches its upper estimate, it would set a new world record price for the artist's work. The current high of £5.6million is for The Football Match, set earlier this year.

Lowry's Piccadilly painting features ads for Coca Cola, Bovril, Max Factor, Gordon's Gin and Wrigleys on the famous hoardings overlooking the junction.

Masses: 1953's Fun Fair At Daily Nook, depicting a Good Friday celebration for Lancashire mill workers, which is also set to go under the hammer

Naive realism: Saturday Afternoon, dating back to 1941, with figures enjoying themselves - playing football and cycling - at the weekend in front of an imposing factory building

Another highlight of the sale is Fun Fair At Daisy Nook from 1953, depicting a Good Friday celebration for Lancashire mill workers. It is expected to go for up to £2million.

The sale also includes Saturday Afternoon, dating back to 1941, with figures enjoying themselves - playing football and cycling - at the weekend in front of an imposing factory building.

Lord Forte, who died in 2007, built up his worldwide leisure empire after opening a milk bar on London's Regent Street in 1935, at the age of 26.

Philip Harley, director and head of 20th Century British & Irish Art at Christie's London, said: 'This group offers Lowry collectors the opportunity to acquire a master work from this carefully composed collection, gathered by an eminent figure of the post-war British era.'

The works will be auctioned at the 20th Century British & Irish Art Sale on November 16.
