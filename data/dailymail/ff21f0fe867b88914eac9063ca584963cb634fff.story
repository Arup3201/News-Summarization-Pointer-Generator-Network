A $900million nuclear submarine had to be scrapped after a worker started a small blaze because he wanted to go home early - and firefighters had no idea how to put it out, it has been claimed.

Investigators say a fire on board the USS Miami at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in 2012 got out of control because of confusion over who was supposed to deal with the blaze. 

Local firefighters rushing to the scene were sent back to base by naval commanders before having to be recalled when the order was overturned, wasting vital minutes, says a report.

No water was put on to the flames for two hours at a time because the rescue effort was badly organised and firemen had no experience of tacking a blaze on board a boat, according to a report. 

Investigators said the fire was started by a disgruntled worker who wanted to go home early, but quickly spread, damaging the living quarters, the command and control center and a torpedo room.

The sub was being repaired in a dry dock when the flames took hold. Fortunately the blaze did not reach the nuclear engines.

The report added: 'Complacency had set in, based on the infrequency of shipyard fires and relative success of fire prevention measures. 

'Also, there was an assumption that the proximity to far more assets, especially federal firefighters, reduced the likelihood of a fire not being quickly contained. 

'This organizational reluctance to prepare for a fire of this scale should serve as a wake-up call — large fires can and do happen in industrial environments.'

The Navy launched a series of investigations that led to recommendations, including the installation of temporary automatic fire detection systems while vessels are being repaired or overhauled. 

It also issued a new fire safety and prevention manual, and says it has learned lessons which are being applied across the fleet. 

Seven people were injured fighting the flames which damaged the living quarters, the command and control center and a torpedo room - but luckily did not reach the nuclear engines (pictured, fire damage on board)

Navy chiefs considered flooding the dry dock to douse the flames after it looked like the ship might be lost, but fire crews battled on in small corridors with almost no visibility in an attempt to save it.

Initially it was thought that they had succeeded, but the ship was eventually scrapped when the repair bill topped $700million.

Investigators said firefighters were unfamiliar with the submarine's layout and that there specialist training given on how to fight a fire on a ship, and crews did not know with the layout of the boat. 

However, Brian Tapley, who was the shipyard fire chief at the time, hit back at the claims, saying irefighters conducted monthly walk-throughs, practiced dragging hoses through submarines and never flunked a drill.

Instead he blamed holes cut into the side of the sub for feeding oxygen to the flames, turning the metal shell into a furnace.

Speaking about firemen, seven on whom were injured fighting the blaze, he said: 'They climbed into the belly of an inferno. Every one of them was a hero.'

The Fleet Forces report included 99 recommendations, virtually all of which were redacted because they weren't final decisions, according to Navy spokesman Lt. Timothy Hawkins. 

The Navy experiences a fire of comparable magnitude to the Miami blaze about every five years, and without corrective action, that pattern would continue, investigators said.

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was disappointed the recommendations weren't made public.

He added that he plans to ask the Navy for them, and wants to hold a hearing on firefighting techniques and training to decide whether the force needs more funding.

'The report documents a very compelling need for better training and more expert firefighters that can help stop such catastrophic fires on submarines,' he said.
