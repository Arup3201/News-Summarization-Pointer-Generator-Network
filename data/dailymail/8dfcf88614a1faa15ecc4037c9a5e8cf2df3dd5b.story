Energy Secretary Ed Davey said Britain had a 'moral duty' to act around the world

Critics of the Government’s spending on foreign aid were dismissed as Little Englanders by the Liberal Democrat climate change secretary yesterday.

Ed Davey praised Britain’s £720million pledge to a new UN fund to tackle climate change in the Third World, saying it was our moral duty to act.

The UK is among a number of nations meeting in Berlin to contribute to the Green Climate Fund, which helps poor countries adapt to low carbon energy, such as wind. 

Much of the money will be spent shoring up sea and flood defences in less-developed areas.

Tory backbenchers said it would be better spent on flood defences at home, amid fears the Somerset Levels could again be deluged.

The National Audit Office said flood spending in England was ‘insufficient’ to maintain defences. 

But Mr Davey, the Energy and Climate Change Secretary, said: ‘The poorest and most vulnerable on the planet are already suffering the effects of climate change and it’s our moral duty to act.

‘The idea that we should be isolationist Little Englanders is a complete nonsense.

‘From protecting low-lying islands and coastal settlements from the impact of rising sea levels to helping farmers struggling with lower crop yields caused by weather effects of climate change – British aid can save lives.

‘Other major economies such as the US, Japan, Germany and France have made substantial pledges, and I urge other countries to be equally ambitious.’

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that climate change around the world has implications for the UK, affecting supply chains of groceries and other products.

‘People listening, I think, recognise that we live in a global economy where when something happens in another part of the world it can affect our lives here,’ he said.

Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh, former chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said it was not appropriate to spend so much money elsewhere with the UK still borrowing £100billion a year.

‘We have to look at the interests of the taxpayer and our own people,’ he told the same programme.

Tory MP Sir Edward Davey said he had no problem with helping other countries, but UK flood defences needed to be shored up

‘We had appalling scenes at the Somerset Levels last year. I’ve had villages flooded in Lincolnshire.

‘As the NAO said, we’re still not spending enough on flood alleviation. First of all we need to spend the money here. I’m happy to give money to humanitarian projects. 

'I’m happy to spend money properly on protecting a village in Bangladesh from being flooded, but I don’t want to commit now to £650million on spec.’

Lord Stern, a former government adviser on climate change, said: ‘To suggest we must choose between investing in flood defences in the UK or helping international efforts to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing sea levels to rise along British coasts . . . is to misunderstand both the phenomenon itself and the basics of policy. 

'Reducing risk and managing the effects of climate change must go hand in hand.’

At the Berlin conference, aimed at encouraging governments to give money to the fund, the US has pledged £1.92billion, Japan has offered £959million, and France and Germany will offer £640million each.

Mark Goldring, of Oxfam GB, said: ‘This is a big step forward in the fight against climate change and is further evidence that the UK is a global leader in tackling poverty.

‘The money will be crucial in helping poor people protect themselves from the rising sea levels, storms and droughts that climate change will bring. 

'This pledge will help build momentum for a global deal in Paris next year to cut emissions.’
