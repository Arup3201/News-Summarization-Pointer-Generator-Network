A Colorado mayor has resigned amid allegations that he inappropriately touched a 17-year-old boy in a hot tub at his home.

David Turley, mayor of the city of Woodland Park, resigned on Monday, saying the allegations against him were ‘false’ and that it had become ‘impossible’ to serve the community.

Turley, 65, was arrested on May 23 after police say he admitted to the inappropriate contact during a recorded call with the boy.

According to court documents released last month, friends, relatives and a school official became concerned about the ties between Turley and the teen and asked investigators to look into it.

"Just look into it, it's just too weird," Samuel Hedges, father of the alleged victim's classmate, told Woodland Park police according to The Gazette.

Police say Turley bought sports equipment, a video game system and an iPhone for the teen and offered to give him $10,000 for college.

The arrest affidavit said when the alleged victim was first interviewed by police in April, he said Turley was a friend and a father figure to him but denied being molested.

Then on May 11 the teen said he was in the hot tub with Turley when he was touched inappropriately.

Turley was arrested on a charge of sexual assault by a person in a position of trust and unlawful sexual contact.

Turley, a longtime resident of Woodland Park, was elected to his first two-year term as mayor in April 2012 and then re-elected in April 2014.

In the resignation letter Turley maintained his innocence, saying he looks forward to having his ‘name cleared... in a court of law,’ reports The Denver Post.

The name of the alleged victim has not been released.
