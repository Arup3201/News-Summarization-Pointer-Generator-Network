While people might generally think of the average Aussie male as tall, lean and well-built, research shows that perception is wide of the mark.

In fact, the average Mr Australia has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 27, which is comfortably in the overweight category, and not far off being classified as clinically obese.

Researcher, and graphic designer, Nickolay Lamm, from Pittsburgh, US, compared the bodies of Mr Average from around the globe, as part of a body measurement project.

So how does Mr Oz size up? 

The following graphic looks at the size of the average Australian man compared to his counterpart from USA, the Netherlands, France and Japan

 

Many see the typical Aussie male as being tall and muscular, like Hugh Jackman, pictured here in Sydney

Average Aussie male stands at 175.6cm tall and hits the scales at 85.9kg, giving him a BMI of 27, which is smack bang in the middle of the overweight category

The Average Mr Australia stands at 175.6cm tall and hits the scales at 85.9 kilograms, leaving him with a BMI of 27, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. 

It's far from the rippling image of Chris Hemmsworth or Hugh Jackman, but the average Aussie is still leaner than Mr America, whose BMI is 29 and stands up at 176.4cm, reports Sydney Morning Herald.

Mr Japan is the healthiest, with a BMI of 23. Mr Netherlands stands at 183.3cm and a BMI of 25.2, while France comes in at 25.5 at 174.4 cm.

The results highlight the growing threat of obesity in Australia, which increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and increased blood pressure.

While the average Aussie male might not be as buff as he's often perceived, another recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences revealed super-muscular male body types seen in Hollywood are not attractive in some cultures.

For example, in South America,  softer, more feminine looking men are perceived as more attractive.

Last year, graphic artist and researcher Nickolay Lamm used data of the average American woman to create a graphic of an average barbie, then pictured her next to a standard barbie

It's not the first time that Nickolay Lamm, 24, has endeavoured to reshape body image perceptions.

Last year, he used the measurement of an average American women to create a graphic of a barbie with these proportions, then pictured her next to a traditional barbie.

Scaled up to human size, Mr Lamm found Barbie was grossly disproportionate and would have a BMI of 16.24, which is considered  severely anorexic.

The study reignited the sentiment that the doll was promoting unhealthy body image in girls.

Lamm spoke out about the artwork, saying 'If we criticise skinny models, we should at least be open to the possibility that Barbie may negatively influence young girls as well.'

Australians came in slightly leaner than the average American, but don't live as long as Mr Average Japan
