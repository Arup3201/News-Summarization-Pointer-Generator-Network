Top French chef Marc Veyrat has vowed 'I'll be back' after a fire tore through his Alpine restaurant.

The fire broke out Tuesday at the celebrity chef's La Maison du Bois, a wooden chalet 6,000 feet up in the French Alps near the Swiss border, causing substantial damage.

Firefighters had extinguished the blaze inside the restaurant by mid-morning but were still battling to bring it under control as it ravaged the roof of the wooden structure.

Authorities said it appeared to have started in the kitchens and spread rapidly to the dining area, where several pieces of antique furniture were destroyed.

Veyrat, considered by some to be the finest chef in the world with six Michelin stars to his name, said a piece of 'cultural history' had been destroyed. 

'This is a life and a piece of French cultural history that has just gone up in flames,' he said.

'It's not just a restaurant but also a museum of popular art showing several pieces of furniture from the region. It's sad, but I'm a fighter. I'll be back.'

Known as much for roaming the countryside seeking wild herbs for his top-of-the-range dishes as for his trademark black hat, Veyrat has already suffered a forced break in his career.

In 2009, he stopped work, saying he could no longer bear the physical strains of the kitchen after a serious ski accident.

Recovery: Veyrat opened La Maison Des Bois after taking a break from his culinary ventures following a skiing accident

He handed back the six Michelin stars he had won for two separate three-star restaurants and only  re-entered the kitchen in 2013, opening his Alpine restaurant.

Veyrat specialises in traditional dishes, with lots of wild herbs and a little 'molecular gastronomy', chemistry-inspired recipes that produce new textures such as emulsions in cuisine.

But such Michelin-starred genius does not come cheap.

According to his website, the top 12-course tasting menu at La Maison du Bois would set the diner back £225.
