Jack Wilshere has revealed the secret behind England's new midfield - the 'five-second fury.'

The Arsenal midfielder starred in a central role alongside Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph in England's 1-0 win over Estonia on Sunday.

And Wilshere believes England are now a 'horrible' team to play against, due to their constant and aggressive pursuit of possession.

'We're trying to become better as a team. On the pitch and off the pitch we are really close - on the pitch we are starting to become a horrible team to play against,' Wilshere said after the match.

'We've got a great, compact unit there in the middle, we get after the ball and we win it.

'We talk about the "five-second fury", when we lose it - go get it back. We are starting to do those things.

'In the first half we should have scored a few goals but in the second half we felt confident.

'Even when they went down to 10 men it might have made it a little bit harder, but we kept going and Wayne produced a bit of magic.'

England ground out a 1-0 win in Tallinn thanks to a Wayne Rooney free kick in the second half.

The win means England have won all three of their Euro 2016 qualifying games, are top of the group and look almost certain to qualify for France in two years' time.
