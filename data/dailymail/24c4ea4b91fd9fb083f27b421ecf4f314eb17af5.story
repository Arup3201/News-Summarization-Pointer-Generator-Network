Brendan Rodgers has rubbished claims by West Ham United boss Sam Allardyce that Liverpool succumbed to defeat to Aston Villa due to complacency by insisting the Reds are 'allergic' to such a thing.

The Anfielders surprisingly fell to a 1-0 home loss against Villa last weekend and Hammers manager Allardyce suggested Liverpool had taken their opponents lightly because they were instead focusing on facing Ludogorets in the Champions League in mid-week. 

But Rodgers, whose side will aim to bounce back with a win at Upton Park on Saturday, insists nothing could be further from the truth.

When asked if there was any truth in what Allardyce had said, Rodgers responded: 'No, not at all. We are allergic to complacency here.

'It was that - we're not good enough to be complacent yet. The fact is that Villa played well, as simple as that.

'There are a lot of experts in the game and I am consistently being told how to play, how to work - but we will always find ways to win.'
