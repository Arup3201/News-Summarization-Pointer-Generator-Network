The latest version of Samsung’s Galaxy smartphone could have a three-sided display, rumours suggest.

The new smartphone, which is tipped to launch next year, might sport a wrap-around display so that content on the curved screen can be read from extreme angles.

The display is likely to feature on Samsung’s Galaxy S or Note luxury handsets, but it could even be the first of a new line of curvier handsets, according to the rumours.

A wraparound screen gets rid of dead space at the side of a handset, allowing for a larger display without a wider phone.

The innovation allows for more innovative smartphone designs to give consumers something different.

Curvier handsets could be more comfortable to hold and the screens easier to read.

Some concepts have shown home and command buttons positioned on the side of handset screens - as well as caller ID and rolling news.

By making use of the side of handsets for pop-up alerts, it enables a user to be able to multitask more effectively.

Sources close to the company told Bloomberg the phone will use an enhanced version of the company’s Youm technology.

Youm is used in Samsung’s Galaxy Round handset, which was released last month.

However there is currently no release date for the next generation device, although it is likely to be launched in the second half of 2014, the sources said.

The sources believe each side of the display could operate independently, which could make for a radical new experience for a smartphone user.

Samsung sells around one in three luxury handset and is locked in competition with Apple to showcase the latest technologies in its smartphones.

The new curved display is likely to feature on Samsung's S or Note luxury handsets, or could be the first of a new line of smartphones, according to rumours. It is predicted the device will use an updated version of the company's Youm technology, which is used for the Galaxy Round handset (pictured) launched last month

There are a number of companies working on curved screens. The Semiconductor Energy Laboratory has made a lightweight C-Axis Aligned Crystal (CAAC) material for this prototype smartphone, which has icons down its sides and allows images to 'spill' round its corners. It also allows for rolling text down its sides

Samsung will hope to repeat the success of its Galaxy S4 handset released in April (pictured) which is responsible for more than 60 percent of its third quarter profit

Apple is believed to be developing iPhones with larger screens, enhanced sensors for greater touchscreen accuracy and curved displays, putting pressure on Samsung to also be innovative with the designs of its next handsets.

Van Baker, director of research at Gartner, said: ‘We’ll see curved displays coming into the market, but it’s just a question of whether they will gain any significant traction with customers.’

Samsung has already shown off curved screens at the Consumer Electronics Show in January and has used a flexible display for its Galaxy Gear smartwatch, as well as in a design for spectacles similar to Google Glass, that will be able to answer calls.

Samsung filed a U.S. trademark application for Youm last year and has said the technology could be used in next generation computers and televisions, as well as Christmas lights.

Lee Do Hoon, an analyst at CIMB Group Holding Bhd, in South Korea, said Samsung has a competitive advantage over Apple in the race to launch smartphones with flexible screens.

Apple is expected to launch two handsets with larger, curved screens by the end of next year, according to rumours.

The person ‘familiar with the plans’ said Apple is developing a 4.7-inch as well as a 5.5-inch model to rival Samsung and LG’s latest bendy handsets.

The two phones are expected to curve along the side edges, Bloomberg reported.

Reports said Apple’s curved glass could also come with sensors capable of identifying how heavy, or light a user’s touch is, meaning it could distinguish different pressure points.

Both of Apple's new handsets are said to be ‘still in development,’ so they may not be released until at least September 2014.

This would coincide with Apple’s annual product launch.
