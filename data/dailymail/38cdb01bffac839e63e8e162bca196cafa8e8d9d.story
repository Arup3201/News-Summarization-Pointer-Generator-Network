Chemical weapons stockpiled by the Assad regime in Syria could fall into the hands of rebels Al Qaeda-linked rebels, British spy chiefs have warned.

Spooks warn of potentially ‘catastrophic’
consequences of extremists gaining access to sarin, ricin, mustard gas and
VX - described as ‘the deadliest nerve agent ever created’.

Extremist
elements in Syria represent ‘the most worrying terrorist
threat’ to the UK and its allies, the  parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee
said.

Threat: Rebel fighters sit in front of shuttered shops in the neighborhood of Beit Hujaira, south of the Syrian capital capital Damascus

Warning: While Free Syrian Army fighters have had to rely on homemade weapons, British spy chief warn Al- Qaeda-linked groups could seize chemical weapons with 'catastrophic' consequences

In its annual report, the ISC said there was ‘serious
concern’ about the security of the ‘vast stockpiles’ of chemical
weapons amassed by the regime of president Bashar Assad.

MI6 chief Sir John Sawers told the committee there was the
risk of ‘a highly worrying proliferation around the time of the regime fall’.

The committee said: ‘There has to be a significant risk
that some of the country's chemical weapons stockpile could fall into the hands
of those with links to terrorism, in Syria or elsewhere in the region. If this
happens, the consequences could be catastrophic.’

Fears: MI6 chief Sir John Sawers said the Assad regime had stepped up its stockpiling of chemical weapons before the conflict erupted

Senior government ministers have warned of the threat posed to Britain by extremists fighting in Syria.

Foreign Secretary William Hague has warned a terror attack could be launched in the UK by Britons radicalised while fighting with rebels in Syria.

He suggested a 'substantial number' of British fighters had joined the battle to defeat president Bashar Assad, posing 'current and future risks to UK national security'.

And last month Prime Minister David Cameron disclosed that al
Qaeda-linked elements in the opposition movement had attempted to acquire
chemical weapons for probable use in Syria.

The ISC said there is now a risk that extremist elements in Syria could take advantage of the ‘permissive
environment’ there to plot attacks on targets in the West.

‘Large numbers of radicalised individuals have been attracted
to the country, including significant numbers from the UK and Europe,’ the
report said.

‘They are likely to acquire expertise and experience
which could significantly increase the threat posed when they return home.

‘Furthermore, there is growing concern about the risks
around extremist groups in Syria gaining access to regime stocks of chemical
weapons.’

The report also highlighted the growing threat of attacks
by ‘lone actors’, such as the stabbing of Labour MP Stephen Timms while holding
a surgery in his east London constituency in 2010.

It said the risks are inherently much more difficult for
the security services to manage as, by their nature, lone actors are much
harder to detect - something al Qaida appears determined to exploit.

One Home Office official told the committee: ‘There is no
doubt that the more sophisticated people in al Qaida recognise that groups are,
in some ways, a thing of the past; and that encouraging lone acts of terror is
exactly the way forward.’
