Twenty-eight inmates escaped from a Brazilian jail after three women in sexy police costumes 'seduced' the prison wardens.

Police found three wardens naked and handcuffed inside the morning after the mass breakout at Nova Mutum public jail near Cuiaba.

Investigators say the women drugged the guards with spiked whisky after convincing them to take part in an orgy.

They arrived at around 3am on Thursday morning and asked if they could come inside to 'chat and drink', police say.

The prison guards obliged and were soon persuaded to leave their posts, before heading to the sleeping quarters with the scantily clad women.

After drugging and handcuffing the wardens, they took their keys and unlocked all the prison's cells according to police chief Angelina de Andrades Ferreira.

She told a news conference: 'The plan was to seduce them. They served them cheap whisky with some substance to knock them out, then unlocked the central gate which accesses the internal cells. 

'Whoever wanted to escape left by the front door. From the moment they drank the whisky the agents don't remember a thing. 

'One was found dizzy, trying to wake up. Another slept for the whole afternoon and couldn't even be questioned.'

Dozens of prisoners walked straight out the main door carrying guns and ammunition they took from the prison caches.

The inmates took three 12-calibre rifles, shotguns, two 38-calibre revolvers and munition, she said.

Police later discovered a bag of lingerie and skimpy leather police uniforms which they believe the temptresses wore to distract the wardens.

Blame: The prison guards will now be charged with 'facilitating a jailbreak' and 'culpable embezzlement' because some prisoners walked out with weapons from the prison cache

Ms Ferreira said the escape was orchestrated by the boyfriend of one of the women who tricked the wardens.

Bruno Amorim - who was one of the 28 that escaped - was serving time for attempted murder, robbery and firearms possession. 

A photo of one of the prison guards - lying face down without trousers on - was reportedly leaked by the police officers who found him.

It has since been shared thousands of times on social media networks.

The police chief said the three prison officers had been arrested and will be charged with 'facilitating a jailbreak' and 'culpable embezzlement' due of the theft of firearms.

Last night, eight of the prisoners were recaptured after the police launched a massive manhunt to track down the fugitives. 

One inmate was found wandering around the centre of Nova Mutum in a drunken state, waving one of the stolen rifles. 

Another was caught after stealing a stealing a pick-up truck from a farm and crashing it, police said.
