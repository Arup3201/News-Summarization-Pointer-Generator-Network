Two leaping lions gave a safari tour group something to remember by letting off steam in a spectacular show of kung fu play fighting.

The big cats were fast as lightning during the airborne tussle at the Madikwe game reserve in South Africa.

One executed a kung fu kick while the other slashed at the air before they tumbled to the ground.

Two lions at the Madikwe game reserve in South Africa indulged in some kung fu play fighting to the delight of tourists on safari

The fight began when the pair locked eyes and charged towards each other in a burst of energy

The big cats leaped into the air during their clash - but the pair were only letting off steam

Gavin Tonkinson, 35, a manager at the Tuningi Safari Lodge, caught the encounter on camera as he led a group of tourists around the reserve.

Mr Tonkinson said: 'They were in a really playful mood that particular morning and definitely in the mood for some aerial acrobatics.

'Only the guests and I got to witness their amazing strength and we were all mesmerised at their jumping powers.

The lions fell back to the ground, watched by a group of tourists on safari led by Gavin Tonkinson, who photographed the encounter

One lion came off worse than its friend in the fight, landing on its back while its opponent looked on

'They do this to hone their hunting skills as well as build their eye muscle co-ordination for the real deal some day.

'Lions are my favourite animal to photograph on safaris especially when they are in this type of mood. They must have jumped around two metres into the air.

'I have never seen them jump so high before and I have been living in the bush for the last 13 years.'
