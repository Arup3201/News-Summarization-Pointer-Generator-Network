An infinity scarf that comes equipped with an inflatable neck pillow may be the most stylish way to catch some sleep on the go.

The  Sleeper Scarf, which is the brainchild of Tiffany Paul, from San Francisco, California, is the first ever scarf to come complete with a built-in pocket designed to discreetly conceal a blow-up pillow, making it ideal for travelers eager to catch some rest wherever they can.

'[The scarf] is as functional as it is fashionable,’ Miss Paul explained in a video shared on her website. ‘It's perfect for planes, trains, buses and cars.'

She added that the Sleeper Scarf is also great for taking power naps and 'getting a good night's rest' while traveling. 

Her patented design looks like a standard infinity scarf, which is essentially the point. The inflatable neck pillow goes undetected until the wearer is ready to get some shut-eye.

As demonstrated in the video, users simply need to unwrap the scarf, unzip the back pocket, open the valve and inflate the pillow with a few quick breaths.  

On her website, the creator encourages travelers to 'ditch that bulky neck pillow' and purchase one of her scarves, which retail for $65 and come in a variety of colors.

While Miss Paul may be the first person to design a scarf that doubles as a pillow, she isn't the only one creating useful products to help travelers get some sleep on the go. 

The Pillow Tie, an inflatable necktie that allows workers to take emergency naps at their desks, debuted in 2010.

Two years later, The HoodiePillow, a hoodie with a built-in inflatable travel neck pillow, was released.
