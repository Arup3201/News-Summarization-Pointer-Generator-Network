Maybe come the season’s end, Brendan Rodgers will look back to Boxing Day and realise that was when Liverpool’s fortunes finally turned.

This was a day that had all the elements to give Rodgers nightmares: freezing cold conditions, incessant, squally rain, a home side high on energy and endeavour and Liverpool bedecked in that dreadful yellow kit, the one they always seem to lose in.

They might have lost wearing it again at Turf Moor. For sizeable parts of this collision with Burnley, Liverpool were second best and had they gone in at half-time two goals down, Rodgers could have had no complaints. He has, after all, seen his team capsize in similar conditions.

Here, though, they weathered the storm and thanks to the dancing feet of Raheem Sterling, they headed back down the M6 with three points and, crucially, their momentum building; defeat in East Lancashire may have killed their Champions League ambitions but, for now, they can keep believing.

Improvement, undoubtedly, is required for them to reach the top four next May but sometimes a team needs an afternoon like this to send them in the right direction. After drawing with Arsenal, Liverpool had to follow up by beating Burnley. Somehow they did.

Bold words are all well and good but they need to have substance to be taken seriously, so having insisted Liverpool were “absolutely” capable of reaching the top four following their 2-2 draw with Arsenal, Rodgers required a similarly robust performance.

For much of the first 45 minutes, he would have been tempted to watch the action unfold with hands clasped over his face. Liverpool were wretched, only posing a sporadic threat on the break, as Burnley scuffled and scurried and knocked them out of their stride.

Nobody was busier than the impressive Danny Ings and he almost opened the scoring in the 14th minute when Liverpool’s defence froze and, with Brad Jones rooted to his spot, he thrashed a right-footed drive that thudded against the post before rebounding to safety. 

That proved to be Jones’ last involvement as he was substituted immediately – Rodgers would later reveal he damaged his thigh – replaced by Simon Mignolet.

What became immediately apparent, was the break from the team had not done anything for Mignolet’s confidence as in the first five minutes he was on the pitch, he flapped at two crosses and had one clearance charged down by Ings.

Burnley’s supporters preyed on his vulnerability, taunting him as he prepared to take goal kicks, and it was hard not to feel some sympathy for the Belgian; he resembled a golfer with a severe case of the ‘yips’, every kick resembling a skewwhiff drive being sliced out of bounds.

Sensing a chance to take advantage, Burnley upped the tempo. Their work was relentless and intense, it unsettled Liverpool and enabled them to start creating chances. With better fortune and sharper finishing, they would have sewn matters up before the interval.

Ings went close with a header after one quick break; Mignolet was grateful to Lucas Leiva when the Brazilian diverted a shot from Scott Arlfield around the post; George Boyd thrashed another right-footed drive just over the bar. Play like this from January to May and they will stay up.

Other a one tame shot from Adam Lallana, which Tom Heaton comfortably dealt with, Liverpool offered nothing and it was with good reason there was a collective sigh of relief when half-time was called. Against different opposition, they would not have been so fortunate.

Rodgers marched back to the sanctuary of Liverpool’s dressing room with much to consider and he sent his players out for the second period early, having made another adjustment with Emre Can replacing Kolo Toure, who had suffered most at the hands of Ings.

That meant Liverpool had only two natural defenders but the brave call soon began to pay dividends; Can, usually a midfielder, gave Liverpool more assurance and he used possession more competently than Toure. The more they kept the ball, the more they frustrated Burnley.

Soon the change in momentum became obvious. Burnley’s supporters, having been so loud, began to lose voice and in the 63rd minute, they saw their team drop their guard and, in the blink of an eye, they had been undone by a classic sucker-punch.

There did not seem to be any danger when Lucas jumped for a ball inside his own half but the Brazilian’s header found Philippe Coutinho, who in turn ushered Sterling forward with a perfectly weighted lofted pass. 

Liverpool's defence struggled to deal with Burnley in the first half and they couldn't put together any meaningful attacks either

Sterling did not need a second invitation to streak away and as Heaton sped out to try and divert the danger, the England winger jinked around his challenge before rolling the ball into the net in front of the David Fishwick Stand, which housed Liverpool’s supporters.

Such was Rodgers’ relief, he repeatedly pointed at Sterling, seemingly praising and thanking him in equal measure. Coming so soon after Martin Skrtel’s point-saving header on Sunday, this was another big goal for Liverpool and, perhaps, further evidence that they can get to where they want to be

‘We had to show a different side to us, different types of qualities to what we showed against Arsenal and Bournemouth,’ said Rodgers. ‘the home crowd gotbehind the team, a team that is always in the game. Burnley don’t concede too many, so my players deserved huge credit.’

For the plaudits to continue, the results must keep coming and Swansea are up next on Monday. There is no margin for error but keep winning like this and Rodgers will not be complaining.
