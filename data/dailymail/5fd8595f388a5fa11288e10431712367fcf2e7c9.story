Fred the sulphur-crested cockatoo has celebrated his 100th birthday at Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary outside Hobart 

A sulphur-crested cockatoo has apparently made it to his 100th year, surpassing most birds of his kind by 60 years. 

Keeping to tradition, Fred - the flying-centenarian, was sent a letter from The Queen at Buckingham Palace to mark his special milestone.

The talking-bird was also thrown a huge birthday-bash by his carers at the Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary outside Hobart on Sunday. 

Greg Irons, Director of Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary told Daily Mail Australia that Fred could in fact be even older than 100. 

'We aren't 100 per cent sure but we think that he is well past,' he said. 

'He was 95-years-old when I started working, which was 10 years ago - we just waited a bit longer to make sure he is past 100'.

If Fred's age is in fact correct, the senior bird would have been born around World War 1 in 1915, flying his way through a hundred years of  memories.

'He is in really good nick and even though he isn't as active as the younger ones he is still remarkable for the way he carries on. 

'He doesn't do a lot of flying, still dances, sings and talks a lot. 

'He behaves like a two-year-old,' Mr Irons said.   

Other than a few sprains, Fred has had no health issues and has not visited a vet in 10 years. 

'He is a resilient little character - we all love him here.'  

Mr Irons said Fred came to the Sanctuary 20-years ago through a woman's will. 

'He [Fred] was originally owned for decades by a lady who passed away,' he said. 'Fred was then looked after by her family who had to move. 

'The lady actually requested in her will to give Fred to us, so they gave him to us.'

Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary receives many birds from owners who can no longer care for them. But unlike Fred, most of them do not make it to 100. 

For cockatoos living in captivity like Fred, 70 is considered extraordinarily old. Sulphur-crested cockatoos in the wild live to about 40-years-old.

Similarly to human's noses, bird's beaks grow with age.

 Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary manager, Petra Harris, gave Fred his special birthday cake. Fred apparently has a HUGE crush on her - it made his day

'Because his beak keeps growing as he gets older we have had to monitor it by making sure we feed him food that helps to slow it down,' Mr Irons said. 

But for Fred's birthday, Sanctuary workers allowed the birthday-boy to indulge.

'We got him a special cake which was all made of natural ingredients - honey based bird seeds and nuts - he enjoyed it so much.' 

Members of the public and the Wild Child Kids Club took part in Fred's birthday celebration, dressing up in cockatoo suits and helmets while they enjoyed face painting and a sausage sizzle. 

'Fred doesn't think he is a bird, he thinks he is a person, so when he has all that human attention he loves it.

'It was so touching to see everyone here,' Mr Irons said. 'It says a lot about animals in general.'  

But Fred doesn't warm to everyone - he has a preference.

Even at the age of 100, Fred still goes weak at the knees for women. 

'He is one for the ladies - he doesn't like males. He is a man-hater.'    

Fred, who is 'full-of-life and constantly interacting with humans', is an icon for all animals, according to Mr Irons.

'It says a lot about Fred who is able to develop such a great interaction with kids - he represents all animals. 

'If it helps a child to have a moment with an animal like Fred, well that goes a long way - teaching them how to respect animals.' 

Mr Irons said he has seen a few cockatoos reach 120-years-old but none quite like Fred.

'He is a special boy to all of us - he brings a lot of life.

'I would love to think he would be around for another 10 or 20 years.'
