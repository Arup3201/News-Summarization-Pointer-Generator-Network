Two young girls made a stomach-churning discovery when they opened a box of Weetabix to find maggots in the cereal.

Cousins Ella Grix and Chloe Appleford were about to pour milk over their afternoon snack when they discovered several crawling worms in the bowl.

Their grandmother Yvonne Read, 45, who bought the chocolate cereal from a discount shop in Gravesend, Kent, has sworn never to buy Weetabix again.

Horrific discovery: Yvonne Read, aged 45, with her grandchildren Ella Grix and Chloe Appleford, both six, and the Weetabix bar they found full of maggots

 ‘I will never buy or eat Weetabix again. It was disgusting,’ a shocked Ms Read said.

‘The
box was sealed so they must have got in at the supermarket or factory. 
There was about four in each Weetabix. They were all just crawling out.’

Ms Read claims the sell by date on the cereal box was April 10, 2014.

Anthony
Vinoth, 26, shop assistant at Terry Discount Store where the cereal was
bought, blames the producers for the worm invasion.

‘We
understand it's not fair for her to pay 99p and not getting anything 
from it, but it's nothing to do with us, it's Weetabix,’ he said.

The Gravesend shop has now removed the products from its shelves and returned them to the supplier.

A
spokesman for Weetabix Ltd said: ‘We were concerned to hear about what 
Ms Read found and are making arrangements to have the Weetabix analysed.

‘We will, of course, conduct a full and thorough investigation.’
