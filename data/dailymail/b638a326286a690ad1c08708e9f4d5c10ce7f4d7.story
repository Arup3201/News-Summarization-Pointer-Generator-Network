A woman dubbed 'Jihottie' after she was cleared of smuggling money to an extremist fighter in Syria has insisted she did not get off because of her looks - on the day her friend was jailed.

Nawal Msaad, 27, was found not guilty of making money available for terrorism after she was caught with £15,830 (20,000 euros) in her underwear at Heathrow Airport.

A trial heard her school friend, Amal El-Wahabi, had hoodwinked her into taking the money to her husband Aine Davis, a drug dealer who went to Syria to fight in July last year.

A jury found mother-of-two El-Wahabi guilty but cleared Msaad of making money available with 'reasonable cause to suspect that it would or may be used for the purposes of terrorism'.

As El-Wahabi was jailed today, Ms Msaad spoke out against claims she 'got away with it', insisting both she and El-Wahabi were 'duped'.

She told Channel 4 News: 'A lot of people think that I'm the smuggler who got away with it. That the jury only let me off because of my looks.'

Ms Msaad said she had received abuse from Muslims after she was labelled 'Jihottie' for appearing at court in short skirts and low-cut tops.

She added: 'I was supposed to be a jihadi, but there I was dressed in skirts and matching blazers. Many people couldn't handle this,

'We live in a free country, I should be able to wear what I want. This is how I dress normally, why should I change? I am a Muslim and I am proud.'

She said she and her friend knew little about the conflict in Syria before the trial, and were unaware Turkey shared a border with the war-torn country.

Her comments came as El-Wahabi - the first Briton to be convicted of funding jihadists in Syria - was jailed for 28 months and seven days.

Jailing the 27-year-old, Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC told her that from the evidence it was clear that Davis had gone to Syria to fight under the black flag of Isis and also that he had 'no true regard' for her.

He said: 'I am also satisfied that you knew he was engaged in violence with guns for extremist religious and ideological reasons and knew the money you were sending was destined for that purpose.'

Ms Msaad insisted she did not court publicity with her court outfits, saying: 'This is how I dress normally'

The judge said Davis's WhatsApp profile picture showing him brandishing an automatic weapon was a 'particularly shocking image', making it clear what he was doing in Syria, along with other images he sent her posing with guns.

During the trial, jurors were told how Davis, 30, who was born in London with roots in Gambia, met El-Wahabi at a London mosque and become increasingly interested in Islam six or seven years ago.

He left the UK to pursue a jihadist cause in July last year, leaving El-Wahabi and her two young children to live off benefits in London.

The couple stayed in touch through Skype messages and by December last year El-Wahabi had resolved to join him.

Amal El-Wahabi was jailed for 28 months and seven days for sending £15,830 to her extremist boyfriend in Syria

In January, she made the arrangements for Msaad to take the cash to Istanbul in a series of phone calls and messages.

Msaad, who had been studying human resources at London Metropolitan University, agreed to take the cash on the promise of 1,000 euros in expenses, jurors heard.

When she was stopped at the departure gate on January 16 she said the three-day trip to Istanbul was a 'short break' to buy gold for her mother.

She was taken into a private room where she produced thirty-eight 500 euro notes, four 200 euro notes and two 100 euro notes from her underwear.

In her defence, Msaad said she had been 'stitched up' by her friend and she had not intended to fund jihad in Syria.

El-Wahabi denied that her partner, known as Hamza, was in Syria and claimed he was in various countries abroad looking for work.

But the prosecution produced a 'selfie' Davis had sent her while he was away, as well as videos containing jihadist propaganda found on computers seized from her home.

Sentencing El-Wahabi today, the judge told her: 'I am satisfied that the initiative for this offence must have come from Aine Davis and you committed it because you were infatuated with him and thought he might provide for you and your two children.'

The judge added: 'You even contemplated taking your children to Turkey to be nearer their father, when it should have been obvious to you it was in their interests they should be as far away from him as possible.

'He had no true regard for you. Any interest he had in you was only engaged when there was some advantage to him.'

He added: 'You have two children aged five and 17 months or so, to whom you are devoted. Your children are the innocent victims of the offence you have committed and indirectly victims of what Aine Davis was engaged in. They are entirely blameless.'

Aine Davis sent a photo of himself and another man brandishing a machine gun to El-Wahabi after he left

Earlier in mitigation, defence lawyer Mark Summers QC had asked the judge for a suspended sentence because of the effect on the defendant's two children and the absence of any terrorist ambition on her part.

He said Davis put her under pressure and had kept up the 'constant threat' that he would end their marriage and take a second wife in Syria.

The lawyer also argued that Isis in January 2014 was only engaged in a struggle in Syria and had not attempted to establish an Islamic state worldwide.

But prosecutor Kate Wilkinson said that El-Wahabi's support for Davis had not just been to try to send him money.

Her encouragement for his terrorist activities was illustrated by a message she sent him about going on convoy, saying: 'When does your next adventure start? I'm sure you will enjoy it. It will be good for your body and soul.'

The lawyer added: 'The crown should not ignore the fact Isis' aim had always been to establish an Islamic state. Isis has grown into the power and strength it is now because of the efforts made to support it.'

Judge Hilliard had previously warned El-Wahabi, who is London-born of Moroccan descent, that an immediate custodial sentence was inevitable, although he said she was in a 'completely different category' to her husband.

He told her: 'This was a substantial amount of money destined on the evidence straight to the hands of a dangerous extremist who was engaged in violent jihad with all the terror and misery that causes.'

Speaking after the case, Terri Nicholson, of the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism squad, said: 'A necessary component of terrorism is finance. Whether the funding of terrorism takes place in the UK or overseas, the offences are serious and will be subject to thorough investigation.

'In this case, a large quantity of cash was seized which would otherwise have supported terrorist activity in the Syrian conflict.

'This conviction should be viewed as a very clear message not to support those engaged in terrorism.

'There are well established charities through which people can donate for humanitarian purposes in Syria. These charities have experience in providing such assistance in high risk, insecure and dangerous environments. Donations must be made via these routes.'

Research by a British University found that good looks can help defendants convince jurors of their innocence.

In an experiment for the academic study, a jury was found to be more likely to convict suspects deemed unattractive than those seen as good-looking.

Researchers at Bath Spa University came to their conclusions after asking 96 volunteers to read a transcript of a fictitious mugging case.

Half of the participants were given a picture of a suspect deemed 'attractive', the other half was presented with someone classed as 'unattractive'.

Analysis of the results revealed that the supposedly attractive suspects were more likely to be acquitted, despite there being no extra evidence in their favour.

Sandie Taylor, the psychologist who conducted the 2007 study, said: 'Our findings confirm previous research on the effects of defendant characteristics - such as physical attractiveness - on the deliberations of jurors.

'People who are physically attractive are assumed to be clever, successful and have more friends - it is tragic in a way.'
