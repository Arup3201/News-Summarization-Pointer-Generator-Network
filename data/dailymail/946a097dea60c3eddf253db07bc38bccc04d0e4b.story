Roberto Di Matteo has been appointed Schalke manager after the Bundesliga strugglers sacked Jens Keller following a torrid start to the season.

The Italian, who won the Champions League as boss with Chelsea in 2012, has been without a club since being sacked by the Premier League club in November of the same year. 

Di Matteo, who was replaced at Stamford Bridge by Rafa Benitez, was still being paid £130,000-a-week by the Blues until June 2014, but has signed a three-year deal with the Royal Blues in Germany.

The Bundesliga club announced Keller's dismissal on Twitter on Tuesday after a disappointing start to the season that has seen Schalke pick up only eight points in seven league games.

The team lost 2-1 to Hoffenheim on Saturday and has also been knocked out of the German Cup by third-division Dynamo Dresden.

Keller was appointed Schalke's coach in December 2012 but faced constant speculation over his position.
