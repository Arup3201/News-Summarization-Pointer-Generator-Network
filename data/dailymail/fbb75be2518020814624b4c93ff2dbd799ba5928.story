Photos of US ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert meeting with the country's leaders have emerged for the first time since the envoy was attacked by a knife-wielding pro-North Korean activist.

Lippert is recovering at Severance Hospital in Seoul, and was able to meet with US Navy Admiral James Winnefeld as well as members of South Korea's ruling and opposition parties.

Police are charging the activist, Kim Ki-jong, 55, with murder after he slashed the ambassador while screaming demands for Korean reunification.

The attack Thursday on Lippert, at a forum about reunification, prompted rival North Korea to gloat about 'knife slashes of justice,' that left deep gashes and damaged the ambassador's tendons and nerves.

North Korean state media said the attack was 'deserved punishment'. 

Lippert, 42, is recovering well but has complained of pain in the wound on his left wrist and a finger where doctors repaired nerve damage, Severance Hospital official Yoon Do-Heum said in a televised briefing.

Doctors will remove the 80 stiches on Lippert's face on Monday or Tuesday and say he could be out of the hospital on Wednesday.

Hospital officials say he may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months.  

Police, meanwhile, searched the offices of the suspect for documents and computer files as they investigated how the attack was planned and whether others were involved

Kim was detained on Friday and police seized 30 copies of books and print materials from his home, some of which were pro-North Korea, according to Yonhap News.

Dumbfounded: Kim was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Lippert on Thursday morning, which left the ambassador covered in blood

Suspect: Police are seeking an attempted murder charge against Kim Ki-jong, who they say slashed the envoy while screaming demands for Korean reunification

Having material in support of Pyongyang is not illegal, but distributing material propagandizing the isolated communist regime is banned in the South.

Authorities plan on charging Kim with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction.

A further charge of violating South Korea's National Security Law, which bans South Koreans from publicly sympathizing with the North Korean government, was being considered.

The anti-US activist has denied that he intended to kill Lippert.

As part of their investigation they have also requested Kim's past travels to North Korea — seven times between 1999 and 2007 — during a previous era of inter-Korean cooperation, when Seoul was ruled by a liberal government. 

Kim attempted to build a memorial altar for former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after his death in December 2011, police said.

While the North seemed to praise the attacks in its previous comments, its Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said Sunday that linking the slashing to its government was part of an 'anti-DPRK smear campaign'.

Kim, who has a long history of anti-US protests, said he acted alone in the attack on Lippert. 

He told police it was meant as a protest of annual US-South Korean military drills that started Monday — exercises that the North has long maintained are preparations for an invasion. 

Kim said the drills, which Seoul and Washington say are purely defensive, ruined efforts for reconciliation between the Koreas, according to police officials.

While most South Koreans look at the US presence favorably, America infuriates some leftists because of its role in Korea's turbulent modern history.

Washington, which backed the South during the 1950-53 Korean War against the communist North, still stations 28,500 troops on the peninsula, and anti-U.S. activists see the annual military drills with Seoul as a major obstacle to their goal of a unified Korea.

'South and North Korea should be reunified,' Kim shouted as he slashed Lippert with a 10-inch knife, police and witnesses said.

The attack raised questions about security in a city normally seen as ultra-safe, despite regular threats of war from Pyongyang. 

Kim is well-known among police and activists as one of a hard-core group of protesters willing to use violence to highlight their causes.

Police didn't consider the possibility that Kim, who has ties to the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation would show up for the group's breakfast meeting, according to a Seoul police official who didn't want to be named, citing office rules.

US ambassadors have security details, but their size largely depends on the threat level of the post.

Seoul is not considered to be a particularly high threat post despite its proximity to the North Korean border. 

It's not clear how many guards Lippert had, but they would have been fewer than the ambassadors in most of the Middle East.

Seoul's Foreign Ministry said it was the first time a foreign ambassador stationed in modern South Korea had been injured in a violent attack.

However, the Japanese ambassador narrowly escaped injury in 2010 when Kim threw a piece of concrete at him, according to police. 

Kim, who was protesting Japan's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by South Korea, hit the ambassador's secretary instead, media reports said, and was sentenced to a three-year suspended prison term over the attack.

The website of the Woorimadang activist group that Kim heads describes the group's long history of anti-U.S. protests. Photos show him and other activists rallying last week in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul to protest the U.S.-South Korean military drills, which are to run until the end of April.

North Korea's state-controlled media crowed Thursday that Kim's attack reflected the South Korean people's protests against the US for driving the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war because of the joint military drills.

US Secretary of State John Kerry, in Saudi Arabia for meetings with regional leaders, said the US 'will never be intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any American diplomats.'

Activists in Seoul, meanwhile, expressed worries that the attack on Lippert would harm the public image of peaceful protesters, or prompt the conservative government to suppress their activities.

Small to medium-sized demonstrations regularly occur across Seoul, and most are peaceful.

But scuffles with police do break out occasionally, and the burning of effigies of North Korean and Japanese leaders is also common. 

Some demonstrators have also severed their own fingers, thrown bodily fluids at embassies and tried to self-immolate.

Lippert became ambassador last October and has been a regular presence on social media and in speeches and presentations during his time in Seoul. 

He's regularly seen walking his Basset Hound, Grigsby, near his residence, not far from where the attack happened. 

His wife gave birth in Korea and the couple gave their son a Korean middle name.

An elderly man offered dog meat to the recovering ambassador, but it was rejected because of hospital safety rules.

Canine meat is thought to help heal wounds and is commonly offered to surgery patients.

While South Korea is one of the U.S.'s closest Asian allies, America has been partially blamed for the severing of Korea into two countries.

In 1910, the Japanese Empire took control of unified Korea which they ruled as a colony through the end of World War II.

When the Empire fell IN 1945, it was decided in a United Nations agreement that Korea be split in half at the 38th parallel.

The U.S. established a trusteeship in the south while the Soviets took over in the north, leading to the creation in 1948 of two separate countries.

However, both sides thought the situation was temporary that that their respective country would ultimately become the sole head of unified Korea.

Cold War tensions between the U.S. and Soviet Union only fueled these ambitions, and in 1950 the North Korean army invaded the south backed by Chinese and Soviet soldiers.

While the South Koreans nearly lost the war in just the first few months of battle, the U.S. helped booster their forces and retake their land.

The fighting was disasterous for both countries, which eventually agreed to an armistance in July 1953.

Since the Korean War is technically ongoing, the U.S. keeps troops in South Korea at the ready.

However, the strong U.S. military presence in South Korean has led to negative sentiments from some citizens who oppose reliance on the West.

Still, South Korea remains one of the most pro-American populations in the world. According to a 2013 poll, 77 per cent of South Koreans surveyed said they approved of President Obama's leadership.
