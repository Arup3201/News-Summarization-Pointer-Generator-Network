The press room, Old Trafford, 2pm, Saturday 28 February 2015.

That is where and when the team sheets for Manchester United's match with Sunderland will be handed out.

It also when we may find out whether Radamel Falcao has a future at the club.

Saturday could be one of Radamel Falcao's final chances to prove himself against Sunderland at Old Trafford

The Manchester United striker has struggled for form since his £6million loan move to the Premier League

The Colombian boasted a fantastic scoring record at Atletico Madrid, scoring 52 goals in 68 appearances

If he has made the starting XI the Colombian has secured another chance.

Another chance to show why it would be a good idea for Louis van Gaal to part with £43.2m to secure the services of the 29-year-old permanently.

Another chance to reward United fans for their unwavering support.

Another chance to show us that the goalscoring machine who was once one of world football's hottest properties is capable of returning to those dizzy heights after his second serious injury.

If he is not on the list, then it would appear to be the end of the discussion.

Falcao could start for United on Saturday following injuries to Robin van Persie (pictured) and James Wilson

When Van Gaal sits down to pen his line-up for the visit of Gus Poyet's luckless Black Cats he will not be able to select injured duo Robin van Persie and James Wilson.

The Dutchman will instead have to decide whether to play Wayne Rooney upfront on his own or whether to give Falcao, with all of four goals under his belt, the nod to start alongside him.

His decision will tell us much.

If Falcao starts then maybe making that loan move permanent is still under consideration.

If he does not, then super agent Jorge Mendes might want to start calling those clubs he claimed would be only too happy to accommodate his man.
