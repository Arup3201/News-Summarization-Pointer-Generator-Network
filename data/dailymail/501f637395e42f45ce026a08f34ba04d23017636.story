Jonas Gutierrez has made his return to the football field after beating testicular cancer.

The Newcastle midfielder skippered Peter Beardsley's reserves on Monday afternoon as they beat West Ham 4-1 at Whitley Park.

Gutierrez returned to Tyneside earlier this month having had chemotherapy in his native Argentina.

Jonas Gutierrez discovered that he had cancer after a challenge with Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna in May this year.

He revealed that he was receiving treatment for the disease in September, before announcing that he had been given the all-clear in early November.

The 31-year-old ran the Buenos Aries marathon in October to raise money for Argentine cancer charity FUCA (Foundation for Research, Teaching and Cancer Prevention).

The 31-year-old midfielder – who last appeared for Newcastle 14 months ago - has successfully battled the illness on two occasions and says he is now only looking to the future.

'I am good, happy and enjoying every training and every day,' he said.

'I am just looking forward. You never know what can happen in football. The most important thing for me now is to be back and to try to get fit and to be ready if I have a chance of playing. The only thing I can do is do my best.'

Team-mates Fabricio Coloccini, Sammy Ameobi, Paul Dummett, Gabriel Obertan and Adam Armstrong were at Whitley Park to support Gutierrez.

Also in the stand was Sunderland boss Gus Poyet, just 24 hours after his side's victory in the Tyne-Wear derby. He was there to watch son Diego, the West Ham midfielder.

Gutierrez managed 87 minutes on his return to action as goals from Liam Gibson, Cal Roberts, Adam Campbell and Gael Bigirimana secured a comfortable victory for the Magpies.

Gutierrez - who went on loan to Norwich last season - has been assured of a role in Newcastle's first-team by manager Alan Pardew.

'We're pleased to have him back,' Pardew said of the Argentina midfielder last week.

'Jonas is one of those people who livens up the training ground just with his personality, and obviously his illness has magnified that fact. He hasn't been around much but he's in pretty good shape and we are hoping that in two or three weeks he could be back in and around the first team.

'He's keen to earn his right to play but, like any player here, I have to give him an even keel in terms of access to the first team. It's now up to Jonas but it will certainly be emotional for us and for him when he returns, and we will look forward to it.'

Gutierrez last played a senior match in April this year during a loan spell with Norwich City
