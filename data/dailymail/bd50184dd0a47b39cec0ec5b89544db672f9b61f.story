New figures reveal 22.5 per cent of children are obese or overweight, with the highest rates found in Hackney, east London (picture posed by model)

One in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or five, figures show.

This rises to one in five by the final year of primary school when they are ten or 11.

But rates vary across England and are generally much higher in the most deprived areas.

Hackney in East London, for example, has the highest level of obesity, with 14.4 per cent of reception age children – one in seven – and 26.1 per cent of those in Year 6 affected.

The Government had been hoping rates were starting to stabilise or fall, but this year they are back up.

Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show that 22.5 per cent of reception age children are obese or overweight, up from 22.2 per cent last year. For children in Year 6, aged ten or 11, the rate is 33.5 per cent, compared with 33.3 per cent last year.

With the figures released a week earlier than usual, campaigners accused the Government of trying to bury bad news on the day of the Autumn Statement.

The HSCIC denied this, saying the data had been ready sooner and pointing out that the Department of Health had no influence on the publication date.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘It’s very sad – we’re just letting our children get fatter and fatter.

‘It’s going to be another full year before we have any kind of strategy from the Government.

‘It’s tragic. The Government are trying to bury bad news.’

Dr Colin Michie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ‘What is startling is the gulf between health outcomes for rich and poor, the fact that childhood obesity is continuing to rise and children are getting fatter younger.’

Eustace de Sousa, of Public Health England, said: ‘It is deeply concerning that there is an actual doubling of child obesity rates from reception to the end of primary school, and that children from low-income households are significantly more likely to be overweight or obese.’

Obesity levels in children had remained stable over the past few years and last year they appeared to be falling.

This year’s rise has prompted concern that government strategies are not working. These include the ‘Responsibility Deal’, under which food and drinks manufacturers set their own targets for cutting sugar and fat, and the Change4Life campaign.

The figures are based on data from 1.1million children who took part in the National Child Measurement Programme.

The lowest levels of obesity are in Windsor and Maidenhead, Berkshire, affecting just 5.5 per cent of reception children and 16.2 per cent of those in Year 6.

Public health minister Jane Ellison said: ‘Childhood obesity rates have remained stable since 2010 but, as these new statistics show, we know there is more to be done. The whole nation needs to understand the problems obesity can cause.’

Three times as many children have tried e-cigarettes as have smoked tobacco, figures show. 

A study of 1,601 pupils aged ten and 11 in Wales found that 6 per cent had sampled the devices compared to 2 per cent who had smoked cigarettes.

A study of more than 1,000 children found six per cent had tried e-cigarettes compared with two per cent who had smoked cigarettes. Furthermore those who tried the devices said they were more likely to smoke tobacco prompting experts to warn they are 'luring' children to smoking

Those who had tried e-cigs were seven times more likely to take up smoking within the next two years. The findings have added to fears that e-cigs are luring children to more harmful tobacco.

Campaigners called for a ‘watchful eye’ on their use.  

Some 14 per cent of those who’d tried e-cigs said they might start compared to just two per cent of children who’d never tried.

The battery-operated devices resemble pens or cigarettes and they contain a liquid form of nicotine that give users the same rush as smoking.

Mark Drakeford, health minister for Wales said: ‘These latest findings shine further light on the potential impact of e-cigarettes on our children and young people.

‘I am concerned the use of e-cigarettes may act as a gateway to and re-normalise smoking, especially for a generation who have grown up in a largely smoke-free society.'
