A British woman jailed for a year for trying to attend a men's volleyball game in Iran has still not been told her sentence.

Ghoncheh Ghavami was involved in a protest outside a volleyball arena in Tehran in June 20 against a ban on women attending male sporting events in the Islamic republic.

Ms Ghavami, who holds both British and Iranian passports, was found guilty of 'propagating against the ruling system'. 

Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25 (right with her mother Susan, 49) was accused of 'propaganda against the regime'

Her family said she was arrested following a misunderstanding and has been jailed after a trial held behind closed doors.

Her brother Iman Ghavami has been campaigning for the release of his sister, who is being held in solitary confinement inside Tehran's notorious Evin prison. 

He told the Telegraph: 'Ghoncheh doesn’t even know that she has received a year in prison. We understand she is now back on a more severe hunger strike, where she is refusing water as well as food. She must be in a very bad state – especially as she is in a terrible part of Evin prison.'

Mr Ghavami has started a petition calling on the British government to campaign for his sister's release. 

So far, more than 700,000 people have signed the petition, with a further 25,000 liking a Facebook page associated with the campaign. 

Miss Ghavami was released on bail but then arrested when she tried to collect her belongings from a police station a week later, when the authorities discovered she had dual British-Iranian citizenship.

She was thrown into solitary confinement in Iran's notorious Evin political prison and was held for more than 100 days, including 41 days in solitary.

Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen said: 'This is an appalling verdict.

'It's an outrage that a young woman is being locked up simply for peacefully having her say about how women are discriminated against in Iran.

'Ghoncheh is a prisoner of conscience and the Iranian authorities should quash the sentence and release her immediately and unconditionally.

'The authorities should also investigate allegations that Ghoncheh was subjected to death threats by her interrogators and provide compensation for her arbitrary detention and her prolonged solitary confinement.'

Amnesty also insists that the charge against Ghavami did not amount to an internationally-recognisable criminal offence and that she has been jailed solely for her peaceful activities to end discrimination against women. 

Iran's judiciary denies that the charges against Miss Ghavami are linked to her attempts to watch the Iran-Italy volleyball match in June.

She is accused of 'propaganda against the regime' in the Islamic republic and a spokesman said the charge was linked to national security.

Miss Ghavami, a law graduate from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, carried out a 14-day hunger strike in protest against her detention.

Her British-born mother Susan, 49, wrote to her daughter's supporters on Facebook last month.

Mrs Ghavami said: 'Before the commencement, when they brought Ghoncheh, I laid a kiss on her beautiful face and gave her as much comfort as I could in that brief time.'

The family was not allowed inside the courtroom for the 90-minute trial but Mrs Ghavami said they were allowed a brief and emotional family reunion once the session had finished.

She said: 'All of us gathered together for 20 minutes, [the] first time in hundred something days. Ghoncheh kept kissing her grandfather who she hasn't seen for all these 109 days and kept weeping.'

Mrs Ghavami, who met and married Iranian surgeon Houshang Azam Ghavami after moving to Iran, said she had hand-fed her daughter to assure herself that her hunger strike was over.

The family has spoken of their fears for her health after saying she seemed pale and weak during a prison visit. 

Iran does not recognise dual nationality and views Miss Ghavami as an Iranian citizen, but Prime Minister David Cameron has raised her case with Iran's president Hassan Rouhani when the two leaders met last month. 

Speaking before the hearing, her brother Iman, 28, said Miss Ghavami had only been allowed to meet her lawyer two days before the trial.

He said she travelled to Iran to work for a charity teaching literacy to street children.

Mr Ghavami, of Shepherds Bush, West London, said his sister had thought women were allowed to attend international volleyball matches and has called her arrest was 'a truly tragic misunderstanding'.

A petition organised by the family has gathered more than 600,000 signatures and Mr Ghavami told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We want the authorities to know the whole world is watching.'
