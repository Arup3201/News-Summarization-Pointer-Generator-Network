Leeds boxer Josh Warrington will be joined by former football hardman Vinnie Jones on his ring walk for his upcoming fight with Dennis Tubieron next month.

Unbeaten Warrington fights Tubieron for the vacant WBC International featherweight title on April 11 at the Leeds Arena as he looks to maintain his perfect professional record.

The 24-year-old – who works as a dental technician when not in the ring – is a diehard Leeds Untied fan and has an army of fans who follow him wherever he fights.

Vinnie Jones became a cult hero at Leeds and will join Warrington on his ring walk next month

Jones swapped football for acting and starred in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrells 

Jones became a cult hero at Elland Road when he was signed by Howard Wilkinson back in 1989 and helped the club win promotion back to the old Division One in 1991 and despite moving into acting and relocating to LA has been keeping a close eye on Warrington’s progress in the ring.

The footballer turned actor has strong connections with football club and the city and has the club crest tattooed on his leg.

Jones follows former United midfielder Dominic Matteo and rugby league star Jamie Peacock in joining Warrington’s entourage. Matteo and Peacock carried the British and Commonwealth belts when the boxer last fought in his home town back in October. 

Warrington has a unbeaten professional record of 20 wins from 20 fights

Jones was introduced to Warrington by Hayden Evans of HN Sports and he told www.thecitytalking.com: ‘I’ve known Vinnie since he came to Leeds, and I wasn’t surprised when he told me he’d been watching Josh’s fights from over in LA.

‘It says everything about Josh Warrington that so many Leeds sport legends want to give him their support, and when he walks into the ring with Vinnie beside him on April 11th, it’s going to be a special moment on a big night for the city.’
