Frank Lampard has already won the Champions League during his illustrious career and believes his current side Manchester City will win the competition... eventually. 

The on-loan midfielder won the trophy with Chelsea in 2012 following a dramatic penalty shoot with Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena.

And Lampard thinks that City are on the right track to pick up some European silverware but will need to get past Barcelona in the last 16.

Speaking to Man City's website he said: 'This is a trophy every big club needs in their collection and the way City are heading it is one that will happen at some point.

'And these sorts of games are the ones you have to win if you are going to go on and win the competition.

'For me the Champions League is the best club competition in world football.

'Playing against a team like Barcelona and the greatest club teams in Europe when all the eyes of the world are on you is hard to beat.'

Barcelona are City's opponents in the last 16 and they will need to be at their best to stop their front free

Lampard's been involved in many Champions League games during his career at Chelsea and came close on a number occasions to winning it - before that famous night in Munich.

The midfielder scored in the 2008 final against Manchester United but ended up on the losing side after a cruel penalty shoot out defeat.

'I've had lots of good and bad experiences in the Champions League in that I've been knocked out in big games and had big decisions go the wrong way.

The midfielder describes his Champions League success as the 'best night of his career'

'There were many years when I was at Chelsea when success was very close – I think I've played in four or five semi-finals and also lost a final against Manchester United so to actually win it in 2012 was extra sweet and undoubtedly the best night of my career to date.

'I'd love to City do the same and I think it's the club's next step – there will be disappointments along the way and I know that there have been some hard times in this competition in recent years and Chelsea had many hard times as well – but that's what happens when you are up against the best.

'It is difficult to win against these teams – but to go on and win it you have to win matches like this.

'We have to be on the ball for both games against Barcelona because you're playing against such high quality that one lapse of concentration will cost you the game.'
