If you’ve been pulling back the curtains every morning expecting rainclouds to put a stop to summer, worry no more.

Weathermen say the heatwave is set to last into next month.

On Tuesday, temperatures on the South Coast in Hampshire soared to 30C (86F), which was hotter than Cannes on the French Riviera, which only managed 26C (79F).

The images were captured as police

 30ft rock face in Haslingden, Lancashire.

Patrols
 have increased around Jamestone Quarry after teenagers were seen 
jumping into the 30ft-deep water known locally as the ‘Blue Lagoon’.

But
 despite the group being warned about the hidden dangers, officers found
 more youngsters contemplating taking the plunge yesterday.

Meanwhile,
 Britain was a picture of sunshine today as a Met Office map showed 
almost every part of the UK basking in beautiful weather.

The
 hottest place in the country at midday today was Lee-on-the-Solent in 
Hampshire, but its reading of 28C (82F) was expected to be beaten later 
on.

It was Scotland and Northern Ireland's warmest day of the year so far with 27.2C (81F) recorded at Achnagart and 26.1C (79F) at Giant's Causeway.

And there will be only a few thundery interruptions to the sunshine, according to the Met Office.

Spokesman Nicola Maxey said: ‘The stable weather looks likely to continue until the start of August. Over the coming weeks we can expect long periods of sunshine but there is still the risk of occasional showers, some of which could be thundery.

‘Over the next few days we could see temperatures in the mid to high-twenties in London and the South, but temperatures are more likely to be in the mid-twenties elsewhere.

‘As you move into Scotland  temperatures are likely to be in the low twenties.’

She said there are  no immediate plans for the Met Office to issue any hot weather warnings, but added that some parts of the country could experience a high pollen count.

In London it is rated medium, while it is higher in the North, with Yorkshire and Humberside particularly affected. Meanwhile Allergy UK has warned that the heatwave is triggering more cases of asthma and hayfever.

The charity said the high pollen count could also aggravate cases of eczema because sitting on pollen-laden grass could irritate the skin.

Clinical director Maureen Jenkins said the charity has seen an increase in the number of asthma sufferers contacting their helpline over the past weeks.

‘Asthma is a very, very variable thing and different triggers could set off people’s asthma or make things worse,’ she said.

‘Some people are very sensitive to weather changes for instance, like the increase in temperature and rise in pollen.

‘Also for hayfever, we have seen a very mild and wet winter and spring, and we are also seeing a mild summer, so there is a lot of pollen around.’

The charity advises sufferers to monitor the pollen count and to try to avoid being outside when it is at its highest in the early morning and in the evening.

Nose balms, non-sedative antihistamine tablets and sunglasses can also help, the charity added.

Sighting: A barrel jellyfish spotted near St Mawes in Cornwall last month

Record numbers of jellyfish are swimming in British waters, a report by marine biologists claimed today.

Scientists found record numbers of the creature last year, and they believe 2014 is an equally good year for jellyfish sightings.

Last year there were 1,133 sightings of jellyfish, and the researchers said that they have been spotted more than 500 times already this year.

The report, from the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), details more than 5,000 reports of jellyfish sightings of eight different species sent to MCS by the British public between 2003 and 2011.

It discovered ‘hotspots’ for barrel jellyfish in Welsh and Scottish waters. However, there has been a ‘remarkable’ number of barrel jellyfish spotted of the South West already this year.

Prof Brendan Godley, of the University of Exeter, said: ‘By taking stock of our jellyfish in this way, we provide an important baseline of information which will help us understand how jellyfish species react to environmental changes that influence our coastal seas, including climate change.

‘The remarkable number of barrel jellyfish reported from south-west England this year is quite unusual, and at odds with what our report describes, previous years have seen hotspots for this species in west Welsh and Scottish waters.

‘We’re not sure why, but the very mild winter probably meant more adults survived at depth, which will have returned to the surface in spring as waters warmed up. This year’s strange barrel jellyfish results highlight the importance of running the survey year in and year out to track these unusual events and discover if they turn into trends’.

The report, entitled the MCS National Jellyfish Survey, was published in the Journal of the Marine Biological Association.
