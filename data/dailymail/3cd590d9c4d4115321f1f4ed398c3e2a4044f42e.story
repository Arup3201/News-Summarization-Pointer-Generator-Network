Hundreds of tearful mourners applauded today as the bodies of soldiers shot dead in Afghanistan were repatriated.

Corporal Channing Day, 25, from 3 Medical Regiment, was brought back to Britain alongside Corporal David O'Connor, 27, from 40 Commando Royal Marines.

They were repatriated in front of hundreds of weeping family, friends and well-wishers  - some sobbing loudly and others touching the coffins as they drove past - at Carterton, Oxfordshire.

The soldiers were killed in Helmand Province last Wednesday when they came under small arms fire as they travelled to conduct training with Afghan Local Police.

Their Union Flag-draped coffins were flown into RAF Brize Norton, before being taken along the 'Highway for Heroes' in Carterton.

The soldiers' families - many unable to control their grief - wept, laid red and white roses and applauded the funeral cortege as it passed them at 4pm.

Major David Baldwin, a retired Royal Marine who has supported the repatriations for years, said he wanted to show his support and let the bereaved know they were part of an extended family.

He said: 'As a retired member of the Marines I feel a very strong obligation to come up and show the families how much we care and give them support and let them know that we are part of the same family.

'It is not about politics it is about showing support to the families.

David O'Connor was deployed to Afghanistan on September 29 as a Section Commander in the acting rank of Corporal

'I have been coming up here every time a Marine has come back, too many times for my liking but I need to show my support.

'It does not get any easier but I need to be here, we are a family.'

A transporter plane carrying the bodies landed at RAF Brize Norton, in West Oxfordshire, at around 1.30pm. The solemn procession left the Â£2.8million repatriation centre through Britannia Gate and headed to the village of Carterton.

Residents and mourners held a poignant silence as the coffins - draped in Union Jack flags - passed slowly through the streets.

Up to a hundred mourners watched as the cortege made its way north through the town and arrived at the purpose built memorial garden.

More than 20 proud standard bearers, holding flags from the British Armed Forces, stood in silence as the two black hearses drove past.

He said: 'We have had about four weeks
where we have not had a repatriation and we thank our blessings but it 
is inevitable that this memorial garden is going to be used again.

'The people of Carteton have shown consistent support since we took over the role of repatriations on September 1 last year.

'Week
after week there are members of the soldiers regiments, families and 
members of the public from the local area and much much further afield. 
The support has been absolutely consistent.'

Keith Glazier, chairman of Brize Norton Parish Council, echoed Mr Coomber and thanked those who turned up for support.

He
added: 'On each and every repatriation the local population and those 
who have travelled from all over the country to be at this memorial 
garden to show their heart felt respects for the fallen and offer their 
sympathy to the bereaved.'

Investigations are continuing into Corporal O'Connor and Corporal Day's deaths, which happened last Wednesday.
