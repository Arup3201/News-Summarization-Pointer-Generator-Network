No amount of left-over wrapping can paper over the cracks at London Welsh. Sitting bottom of the Aviva Premiership, the Exiles are in desperate need of some comfort and joy.

The statistics are damning. The Oxford club have suffered 10 defeats in 10 games and are in danger of becoming only the second team in league history to be relegated without a single victory.

These are new experiences for Piri Weepu, their World Cup winning scrum-half. His first three months in the Northern Hemisphere delivered more losses than nine seasons as a New Zealand international, but the veteran is not afraid of mucking in.

‘I’ve been in backs-to-the-wall situations before,’ said Weepu. ‘Leading into the World Cup, the All Blacks lost two games in a row. We were expected to win it but we kept focused on what we needed to achieve.

‘The circumstances are different here but we’ve just got to try to overcome it. People need to sell papers and they might talk rubbish about you to do that, but that doesn’t mean we have to buy into it. Comments in the tabloids can ruin your mood if you let them, but we just need to train our backsides off and stay positive.’

Saracens scored 11 tries against Welsh in the 78-7 win, the worst defeat the Exiles have suffered this year

Played 10, Lost 10

Points for 80, Against 490

Average possession per game: 14.41minutes

Goal kicking accuracy: 55%

Missed tackles per game: 28

Turnovers conceded per game: 15

Lineout success: 75%

Scrum success: 78%

Improvements are needed across the board. Welsh have managed less than 15 minutes possession per game this season and have lost by an average of 41 points. 

They have fired in neither attack nor defence, but one of their most consistent downfalls has been at the set-piece.

During their 78-7 defeat by Saracens on Saturday, they lost eight out of 13 lineouts on their own throw. Their scrum did not fare much better and, throughout the season, they have lost 20 per cent of ball on their own feed.

This is compounded by an average concession of 15 turnovers per game, leaving the recently promoted side in desperate need of a morale boost. A victory over London Irish on Boxing Day would be the perfect festive tonic, with Irish sitting one place above Welsh in the league. Weepu, for one has not given up hope.

‘If there’s no belief left, then we probably shouldn’t be in the competition,’ said the 31-year-old. ‘I still love the sport. I still love lacing up the boots and getting amongst it. Even if we’re getting pumped, I still love it. As long as you try your hardest, then that’s all we can really ask. We just need to get our roles right — we create opportunities in games but then we’re not picking the right options.’

Former Wales back row Rowland Phillips was brought in as a defence coach last month in a bid to turn around the club’s fortunes. 

A losing bonus point against Leicester showed signs of progress, but the Exiles still boast the worst tackle success rate in the league, missing an average of 28 per game. 

Phillips says there have been statistical improvements over the last seven weeks but is fully aware of the scale of the challenge.

Despite the leakiest defence in the league, Rowland Phillips insists the defence is getting tougher

‘There’s no fairy godmother who’s going to make everything perfect,’ said Phillips. ‘I joined this group about eight weeks ago and the timing meant I couldn’t just rip everything up and start again. It’s hard for me to convince people, but I have seen a certain improvement. 

There is hunger, but we’re not going to win on pure emotion. We need better structures to earn our right to win. The players know they have to improve and they want to improve.’

Phillips has been tasked with fixing the problems but the roots, he believes, stem from the short summer turnaround. The Exiles were rank outsiders for promotion but beat Bristol through the controversial play-off system. 

While Bristol had already recruited heavily for what seemed inevitable promotion, Welsh panicked in the transfer market place with sporadic recruitment, signing players on a shoestring budget.

Weepu has bags of experience from his time with the All Blacks, and believes his side can turn things around

‘Things happened pretty quickly,’ said Phillips. ‘The play-off season goes on late and the Premiership starts early, so our training and recruitment were affected by the preparation time. You’ve got a small window, with players coming off a tough Championship season. 

There’s about a one-week break and then you’re back in. That has a bearing on how your season unfolds.

‘Any gambling man would have bet on Bristol to walk into the Premiership, but it didn’t happen. Some say the system isn’t effective and there should be no promotion or relegation, but we’re trying to get away from a ring-fence mentality. 

Exeter are an example of a team who got promoted and grew. As soon as you close it off, then that kills off a lot of teams’ ambitions.’

The plight of London Welsh, it seems, will do little for the cause.
