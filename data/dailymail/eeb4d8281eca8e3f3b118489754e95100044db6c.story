Misconduct: Capt. David Geisler is said to have been at the centre of late night, alcohol-fulled parties in Bahrain

Late night alcohol-fulled parties and skinny dipping in a canal are a few of the reasons Captain David Geisler was fired as a commodore in Bahrain last year, according to a new report.

When he was sacked from his position in the 5th fleet, the U.S. Navy would only say that there was a 'loss of confidence' in his ability to command and that an investigation into 'alleged inappropriate conduct' was continuing.

But now a report in the Navy Times has claimed that the commanding officer nicknamed 'Hoss' was at the centre of a several raucous parties. 

The investigation into Geisler's relief, was obtained by the paper via a Freedom of Information Act request.

The main incident which led to Geisler, 45, being discharged from the U.S. Navy is alleged to have happened last June, after a full day of drinking at a glamorous apartment complex called the Floating City.

The host, reportedly a junior officer, had just moved into the complex and threw a house-warming party, inviting a mix of colleagues from her command, friends and neighbours.

She surprised her guests when she stripped off her bikini top, but was soon joined by another male and female who went skinny dipping with her in the canal.  

Witnesses said that was when Capt. David Geisler, the most senior officer at the party and commodore of the logistics task force responsible for supplying all naval assets in 5th Fleet, removed his bathing suit and swam naked in the water.

According to investigators, the canal is in the middle of the luxurious complex, so their naked frolics were in 'plain view' of neighbors and people walking past on the street.

Over the next five months, the junior officer's home became the location of many more parties - including fancy dress such as toga and wear-a-tie night.

At a lingerie party, where guests wore pajamas and silky lingerie, Geisler donned a bathrobe and what appeared to be either a swimsuit or boxers underneath - although one Marine at the party later remembered them as 'black silk shorts.'

Damning find: The investigation into Geisler's relief, was obtained by Navy Times via a Freedom of Information Act request

On one occasion, 
the party-goers jumped onboard a boat belonging to a Belgian couple who 
lived in the complex, leaving a mess of drink stains, cigarette butts 
and rubbish.

'We are in a region where our 
behavior is repeatedly stressed to us from the minute we get off the 
plane,' one officer, who left the party disgusted after seeing Geisler 
swim naked, told investigators in a sworn statement.

'But
seeing these rules openly violated by the chain of command makes me 
wonder how seriously it is taken,' he said reported the Navy Times.

The parties did not slip completely 
under the radar- neighbours, and other officers complained, saying such 
behavior was counter to the prevailing culture in the Islamic country. 

Geisler was at the centre of the parties - he
emailed junior officers from his government computer account to help arrange
parties and texted them on his official BlackBerry organsing to meet up at clubs 
and bars.

But Geisler's hedonistic lifestyle took a
toll on his reputation among other colleagues who did not attend the 
parties, but heard the stories - officers began to feel that an 
'in-crowd' had formed around him and began to think he was only picking 
his fellow party goers for trips abroad and awards.

Staff who knew of the wild parties were too worried about their position if they reported Geisler’s indiscretions - it was made more tricky as one staff officer said that both the legal officer and the command’s equal opportunity manager frequently attended the parties.

If he came forward, one officer 
said, his expectation was: 'I will get crushed.'

Once a complaint was finally made via 
email to Rear Adm. Charles Gaouette, deputy commander of Naval Forces 
Central Command, events changed very quickly.

Five months after the skinny dipping 
party,  Geisler was relieved in mid-October by Vice Adm. Mark Fox, 5th 
Fleet commander, becoming the 19th of 22 COs fired in 2011.

Unwelcome: Capt. David Geisler's behaviour in Bahrain, was not well received - neighbours, and other officers complained, saying such behavior was counter to the prevailing culture in the Islamic country

Geisler received nonjudicial punishment for failure to obey regulations and for conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman and three other officers were also reprimanded

Two weeks after his removal, the 5th Fleet prohibited all drinking on- and off-base from midnight until 6 a.m., every day of the week - the new rules includes bars, restaurants, and public spaces, tellingly including canals.

The damage the parties and raucous behavior caused to relations in Bahrain is unclear.

Fifth Fleet is 'unaware of any host-nation impact' from the indecent parties, Lt. Rebecca Rebarich, a spokeswoman for the fleet, said in an emailed reply to questions from the Navy Times.

Geisler has been reassigned to Naval 
Surface Force Atlantic in Norfolk, Va., according to Navy Personnel 
Command. He did not respond to repeated calls and email requests for 
comment.
