A commercial aircraft carrying 224 passengers and crew was forced to make an emergency landing in Ireland after one of its engines suffered a malfunction over the Atlantic Ocean today.

The emergency was declared while the KLM flight was en route to Amsterdam from Kralendijk, the capital of the Caribbean island of Bonaire.

The twin-engine Airbus A330-203 was around 300 miles southwest of Shannon when the flight crew reported a problem, shut down the left engine and diverted to the Irish city’s airport.

With firefighters and other personnel awaiting its arrival, the plane landed safely about an hour after the emergency was declared during the transatlantic flight.

There were fears that the plane’s brakes could overheat or catch fire during the emergency landing because there was just one engine to provide reverse thrust to help the aircraft to slow down, The Irish Times reported. 

Passengers disembarked and the plane was inspected by aircraft technicians to determine the cause of the malfunction.

A KLM spokesman told MailOnline Travel the cause remains under investigation.

The airline said in a statement: ‘Due to a technical problem the KL765 landed out of precaution safely at Shannon, Ireland. Passengers and crew were not in danger.’

Two smaller Boeing 737-800 planes were sent to the airport to pick up the passengers and fly them to Amsterdam.
