Amir Khan is prepared to take on middleweight world champion Miguel Cotto after missing out on a clash with both Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao.

The long-awaited £200m mega-fight between Mayweather and his Filipino rival is expected to be announced within days.

And that leaves Bolton welterweight Khan without an opponent for his return to the ring in May.

Cotto was expected to defend his WBC title against Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez but no agreement could be reached, and Khan is ready to fight at the Puerto Rican at a catchweight.

'I was speaking to Pacquiao's team and Mayweather's team but now they're fighting each other that kills two names off for me,' he said. 'We've put a call into Timothy Bradley, Juan Manuel Marquez and Miguel Cotto. I think they're big fights for me.

'It's a waiting game at the moment. I'll fight whoever they put in front of me, I've never said no to an opponent.

'I walk around at 160lb and he [Cotto] has the title at 160lb but we know he's not a big 160lb fighter. He got stopped by Pacquiao and Mayweather beat him convincingly so a good boxer would beat him. If we can get him down to 155lb I'd take it in a heartbeat.'

Khan, who expressed a preference to fighting in New York, also insisted a domestic blockbuster with Kell Brook can happen within the next two years.

'With him fighting in March and me fighting early May, the turnaround time for him will be impossible but maybe in the future,' he added. 'I never want to leave out any names, I want to fight the top names.

'The Kell Brook fight will always be there because the fans want to see it, it's a good domestic fight. I've a few years left in my career now and I want to maximise my name in America.

'Kell just won his world title so it would be good to let him defend it a few times then take it off him next year.' 

Mayweather last fought when he beat Marcos Maidana in their rematch last September

Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau last November
