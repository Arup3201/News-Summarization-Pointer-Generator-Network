Yemen president Ali Abdullah Saleh has finally agreed to step down after 33 years following an agreement which gave him immunity from prosecution in exchange for losing power.

The authoritarian leader stepped down after signing a U.S.-backed power transfer deal mediated by Gulf Arab states to resolve the impoverished nation's crisis.

Under the deal, Saleh, who had faced a fierce uprising to oust him as president, will step down and transfer power to the vice president in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

He is the fourth Arab leader toppled in the wave of Arab Spring uprisings this year, after longtime dictators fell in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya.

Seated beside Saudi King Abdullah in the Saudi capital Riyadh, Saleh signed the U.S.-backed deal hammered out by his country's powerful Gulf Arab neighbors to transfer his power within 30 days to his vice president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.

That will be followed by early presidential elections within 90 days.

Saleh had arrived in the Saudi capital today to sign the agreement, according to Yemen state television.

He was dressed smartly in a dark business suit with a matching striped tie and handkerchief and he smiled as he signed the deal, before clapping his hands a few times.

He then spoke for a few minutes to members of the Saudi royal families and international diplomats, promising his ruling party 'will be cooperative' in working with a new unity government.

Saleh said: 'This disagreement for the last 10 months has had a big impact on Yemen in the realms of culture, development, politics, which led to a threat to national unity and destroyed what has been built in past years.'

Saleh addressed the country's troubles without mentioning the demands of protesters who have filled squares across Yemen calling for his ouster, often facing deadly crackdown from his security forces.

He also struck out at those who strove to topple calling the protests the protests a 'coup' and a bombing of his palace mosque that seriously wounded him in June 'a scandal.'

Saleh said his ruling party will be 'among the principle participants' in the proposed national unity government that is to be formed between his party and opposition parties, who also signed the deal.

The plan Saleh agreed to calls for a two-year transition period in which a national unity government will amend the constitution, work to restore security and hold a national dialogue on the country's future.

Saleh has clung to power despite an eight-month-old uprising, mass protests calling for his exit and a June assassination attempt that left him badly wounded and forced him to travel to Saudi Arabia for more than three months of hospital treatment.

Security in Yemen has unravelled amid the uprising against Saleh's 30-year reign.

The situation is particularly bad in the south, where al-Qaida militants - from what is perhaps the world's most active branch of the terror network - have taken control of entire towns, using the turmoil to strengthen their position.

The unarmed protesters have held their ground with remarkable resilience, flocking to the streets of Sanaa and other Yemeni cities and towns to demand reforms from the autocratic government and braving a violent crackdown by government forces that has killed hundreds.

But their uprising, inspired by other Arab revolts in the region that saw longtime rulers of Egypt and Tunisa go, has at times been hijacked by Yemen's two traditional powers - the tribes and the military - further deepening the country's turmoil.

Breakaway military units and tribal fighters have been battling in Sanaa with troops loyal to Saleh, in fighting that has escalated in recent months.

An impoverished nation of some 25 million people, Yemen is of strategic value to the United States and its Gulf Arab allies, particularly Saudi Arabia.

It sits close to the major Gulf oilfields and overlooks key shipping lanes in the Red and Arabian seas.
