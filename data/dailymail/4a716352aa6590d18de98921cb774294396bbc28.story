An original portrait of Hitler’s mistress Eva Braun that was owned by the woman herself has been discovered.

The oil painting that shows her wearing a red hat and a knowing smile is believed to be the official Nazi state portrait.

It was created by the artist Hans Lehmkuhl in 1941 and was kept by Eva Braun until 1943 when she gave it to her friend, Countess Antonia Isabelle Clementine, Grafin von Westphalen zu Furstenberg.

For sale: This portrait of Eva Braun that she once owned is to be offered for sale. It was lost for 70 years and is expected to sell for £6,000

Now the 54x49 inch picture is expected to fetch £6,000 when it goes under the hammer at Mullock’s auction rooms in Ludlow, Shropshire.

The countess married into the zu Stolberg dynasty and the current owner purchased the painting from the family.

The portrait, which comes with documents of provenance, had been lost for 70 years prior to the vendor buying it.

Mealtime: Hitler and Eva Braun pictured in the Berchtesgaden. The photograph was never published in her lifetime and was discovered in a photo album belonging to her that was discovered the by the US Army Signal Corps

Secret: Hitler was rarely seen in public with Eva Braun and their first public engagement was in June 1944 when her sister married a member of his staff

Eva Braun met Hitler in October 1929 
when she was 17 and he was 40, and became his mistress two years later 
after the death of Geli Raubal.

By
 1936 she was part of his household, but did not attend official events 
with him until June 1944 and even then only because her sister married 
one of Hitler’s staff.

In early April 1945, when the war was lost she travelled to be with Hitler and they married shortly before they both committed suicide in his bunker in the Berlin.

Multi-talent: Hans Lehmkuhl not only painted people he was a talented painter of cities, This is his image of Bremen

Richard Westwood-Brookes, from the saleroom, said: ‘This head and shoulders portrait is a fascinating piece of history and shows Eva Braun in colour.

‘Usually she is seen only in black and white but the painting shows her blonde hair and blue eyes, essential for any wife of Hitler.

‘She is pictured wearing a red hat and a blue jacket and appears to be trying to smile.

‘Her relationship with Hitler was a complicated one and it is clear that she was completely devoted to him.

‘Early in their relationship she twice attempted suicide because of him.

‘Our vendor bought this from the family of the person to whom Eva Braun gave it during the war.

‘It was hidden for many years and now is being offered for sale. There will be great interest in it.’

The German artist was a First World War veteran who, in 1936, was commissioned to paint athletes at the Berlin Olympics.

Commissions for top Nazis followed and though never a party member, he remained popular.

He worked until his death in 1969.

The auction takes place on March 18.

The Nazis were obsessed with their image and produced art works to reflect the way they saw themselves – racially pure, obedient and militaristic.

Their art sang the praises of home, family and the National Socialist struggle. It bore similarities to the Soviet propaganda art style.

Modern art was regarded as elitist, morally suspect and too often incomprehensible and much was regarded as ‘degenerate’ and burned along with books.

Hitler favoured Greek and Roman art, which he believed to be both heroic and romantic as well ‘as uncontaminated by Jewish influences’.

In July 1937, the Nazis hosted two art exhibitions in Munich – one, the Great German Art Exhibition, showed works that Hitler approved of, while the other met his and state disapproval The

Degenerate Art Exhibition. Hitler was furious when the Degenerate Art Exhibition attracted more than a million visitors, three times as many as the approved art.

The paintings that were approved had names such as: Fruitful Land, Liberated Land, Blessing of Earth and Standing Guard. Hitler's favourite painter was Adolf Ziegler and Hitler owned a number of his works.

When war came, Nazi art became romanticised, depicting heroic sacrifice and victory.
