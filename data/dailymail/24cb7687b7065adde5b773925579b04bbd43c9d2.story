Federal Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce has accused the animal rights group PETA as using disturbing footage of sheep being abused for 'convenient political effect'.

Mr Joyce slammed the group as ‘extremist’, and calls on PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) to divulge the details of the footage they claim was shot at 19 shearing stations across NSW, Victoria and South Australia between August 2013 and March 2014.

The confronting vision reveals shearers stamping on the heads and necks of sheep when the animals appeared to panic and also throwing the sheep around and slamming their heads and bodies against hard wooden floors.

Mr Joyce calls on PETA to divulge the details of the footage they claim was shot between August 2013 and March 2014

Mr Joyce said PETA should have reported the incidents instead of releasing the vision overnight on Thursday for the most 'convenient political effect.'

‘An emotional response without full investigation, including why it has taken so long for PETA to release the footage, does not result in better husbandry practices,’ he said. ‘It just reinforces the belief that PETA is an extremist group that wants to end livestock production and to irreparably damage the economy and the reputation of Australian farmers.’

‘Otherwise it can be seen as not so much an attempt to end the cruelty, but rather another mechanism to attack rural industry in Australia,’ he said.

He also questioned the authority the group had to film on private property.

The minister is working with the states on controversial ‘ag-gag’ laws to stop activists from placing cameras in factory farms in the hope of exposing animal welfare breaches.

‘While I don't condone the activity, if a man kicks a dog you don't ban the ownership of dogs or automatically think all dog owners are cruel,’ Mr Joyce said.

They were captured on video violently punching sheep in the face in 19 shearing stations across the country

Three PETA US investigators went undercover in 19 shearing sheds across the country and claim to have witnessed attacks by 70 workers, which often left the animals bleeding from their eyes, noses and mouths.

'They were given jobs and they worked with nine different shearing companies. Filming happened openly and many shearers were aware they were being filmed,' Claire Fryer, from PETA Australia, told MailOnline.

Wool Producers Australia (WPA) president Geoff Fisken said the actions of shearers in the video was 'unacceptable and unsupportable', according to Stock & Land.

Mr Fisken added the footage showed isolated incidents by a few shearers.

'We’re sure it doesn’t portray the 99.9 per cent majority of wool shearers and those shearers would be appalled by it as well,' he said.

'Woolgrowers condemn this treatment of animals; we’re not in the business of treating animals like that and nor are shearers.

'We want that type of behaviour to be removed from shearing sheds in Australia.'

The RSPCA said the allegations made public by PETA were serious.

'The allegations are serious and will be investigated by RSPCA Inspectors as information comes to hand for potential breaches of the relevant state animal welfare legislation,' a spokeswoman said.

Outcry has also come in the US over the footage which shows the same treatment of animals in American ranches.

Despite not having seen the footage, a representative of the main U.S. wool industry trade group, the American Wool Council, told NBC News the behavior described by PETA was 'unacceptable.'

'We do not condone or support the actions of anyone that results in the abuse of sheep either intentionally or unintentionally,' Rita Samuelson told the website.

'Rough handling of animals that might result in the injury of a sheep is an unacceptable maneuver during the shearing process or anytime when sheep are handled.'

Shocking footage was released in 2011 by Animals Australia showing the sever mistreatment of animals being exported to Indonesia

Following its release live exports were banned for nearly a month by the Australian government

In 2011 animal cruelty in the live export industry was put under the microscope after footage released by Animals Australia showed cattle being inhumanely slaughtered in Australian centres in Indonesia.

This prompted a national and international outcry, and live exports to Indonesia were suspended for just under a  month, from June 7 to July 6 2011.

Following this, the Australian government were forced to put in place stronger safeguards to ensure the well being of all animals leaving Australia, but animal rights groups argue the situation has not improved.

Following the more recent footage released on Thursday, The PETA investigators claim farmers put tight rings on some lambs' scrotums with anaesthetics to castrate them, but when that failed shearers would just cut off their testicles with shears.

The animals were also deprived of food and water before being sheared so they were too weak to fight, they claim.

Footage shows the shearers violently beating sheep and jabbing them in the head with sharp metal clippers and even a hammer.

Activists claim no painkillers were administered to the sheep before shearers used needles to sew gaping, bloody wounds caused by the shearing.

'Sheep are very gentle animals. Most of the sheep weren’t resisting in any way so it would have been especially frightening for them,' Ms Fryer said. 

'I think it’s extremely shocking. Sheep are very gentle animals. They show fear if they’re on their own.

'It’s devastating and no compassionate person could watch that footage and not be horrified.'

The footage was released by PETA in a new campaign targeting the Australian wool industry.

Mr Fisken said $2.8 million had been spent by WPA in the last year to train shearers to prevent injury or cruelty.

'There will be a fair bit of attention focused on the industry now and we’re disappointed because we’ve come a long way in the last 10 years with animal welfare standards and we’re continuing to put a lot of resources into that area of our business; it’s a high priority,' he said.

He added that WPA would never make PETA happy because the activists wanted them to stop farming all together.

'But we have standards and they're the same as they are for how people treat their family pet,' he said.

Overnight, the RSPCA received cruelty complaints from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) regarding the alleged ill treatment of sheep during shearing in New South Wales and South Australia between August 2013 and March 2014.

The allegations relate to workers beating, kicking and stomping on sheep, and stitching wounds without anaesthetic.

The vision made publicly available by PETA overnight shows sheep being beaten with shearing hand pieces and thrown down a chute. 

Sheep that had been injured during shearing are roughly stitched up.

RSPCA notes that shearing is stressful for sheep and it should be carried out by trained and competent workers. 

The allegations are serious and will be investigated by RSPCA Inspectors as information comes to hand for potential breaches of the relevant state animal welfare legislation.
