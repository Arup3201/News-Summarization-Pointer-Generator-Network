After weeks of speculation, Sir Elton John and David Furnish have finally revealed how their son Zachary was conceived.

While the pair had previously remained silent on which of them was the biological father, Furnish has now confirmed that he and Elton 'both contributed' to the conception of Zachary, who was born to a surrogate mother on Christmas Day last year.

As the pair undertook a surrogacy program in America, the mixing of their semen specimens was allowed - a process which is currently banned in the UK - before being used to fertilise a previously chosen egg.

When asked which of them is Zachary's biological father, Furnish explained: 'We both
 contributed. For the time being we don't have a clue. We look at him 
every day and at the moment he has Elton's nose and my hands.

'Neither of us care. He's our child. The important thing is that he's healthy and happy and loved.'

On
 Zachary's birth certificate, Elton was registered as the boy's father 
while Furnish was named under the mother category in computer documents.

Initially - normally on computer documentation - a ‘father’ and ‘mother’ are listed.

However,
 in ‘gay dad’ surrogacy cases, when the actual certificate is produced, 
the couple can apply to have it re-issued as Parent 1 and Parent 2.

During their interview and photoshoot in OK! magazine, both Elton and Furnish beam with happiness as they introduce little Zachary Jackson
 Levon Furnish-John to the world.

they hold Zachary, dressed in a white top and denim dungarees, on the 
cover of OK! publication.

And Elton has revealed he is thoroughly enjoying fatherhood, and can't wait to 'lavish his love' on his new son.

He said: 'There just aren't proper words to describe that feeling. It's indescribable. It was just...We have a son.'

'I'm
 ready to have a child and lavish my love on our son and not spoil him 
but be there for him and advise him.

'We don't want to spoil him 
materially, although he's already been spoiled rotten by people buying 
him stuff! We just want to give him some wisdom.'

Elton also said he and Furnish are both determined to be as 'hands on' as possible with Zachary.

He added: 'I feed him. David feeds him. We change his nappies. I mean, it's hands on! We are on nappy patrol.'

Elton and Furnish revealed in the accompanying interview in OK! 
magazine that they were present for the Zachary's birth.

Recalling the happy day, Elton said: 'Suddenly, at 2.15am on 
Christmas Day, we were woken up. They said, "Quickly! The baby's 
coming!' We went in and stood behind the bed. Then the top of the head 
came out and David said, "My God, there's the head!"

'Then he shot
 out like a rocket basically - so much so that the obstetrician sort of 
caught him! It was so dramatic and exciting, we didn't have time to get 
emotional. Like there he was, talk about fast!'

Furnish also said the couple haven't ruled out having more children in the future, adding: 'This is a big change in our life. We have to see how we cope and adapt with one child before we even consider a second.'

The Rocket Man singer added that while the couple now have their own son, they will never give up on  Ukrainian orphans Lev, two, and his 
brother Artyom, four, who they met when they visited an orphanage in 2009.

While their plans to adopt the children were thwarted by the country not recognising same sex marriages, Elton insists he will continue providing emotional and financial support for Lev and Artyom.

Elton and Furnish are donating all fees received from the interview and pictures of Zachary to charity.
