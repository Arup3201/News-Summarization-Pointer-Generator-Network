The Champions League has reached the quarter-final stage, with all eight survivors dreaming of making the final in Berlin on June 6.

For the second time in three seasons, we don't have an English representative in the last eight but it's still a high calibre field.

Barcelona, defending champions Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are among the favourites, though Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Monaco and Porto will fancy their chances of springing a surprise.

Follow the quarter-final draw as it happens at UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland from 10.30am.

That's all from me for a little while. I'll be back in about 20 minutes for the Europa League quarter-final draw but in the meantime, you can read everything you need to know on the Champions League here. 

So there we have it. Some brilliant ties in prospect there in the quarter-finals. Confirmation of the draw then:

Paris Saint-Germain vs Barcelona

Atletico Madrid vs Real Madrid

Porto vs Bayern Munich

Juventus vs Monaco

The first legs of this season's Champions League quarter-finals will be played on April 14-15. The second legs will follow a week later on April 21-22.

A Madrid derby! And a repeat of last season's final...

Today's special guest for the draw is Karl-Heinz Riedle and we're about to begin... 

Now a film about the eight remaining teams in the competition, with plenty of atmospheric shots spliced in of the Olympiastadion in Berlin, which will be hosting the final on June 6. 

The stadium in the German capital has a capacity of 74,475 and is, of course, the home of Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin.

It was the venue for the 2006 World Cup final, when Italy beat France on penalties following Zinedine Zidane's infamous headbutt. 

Gianni Infantino, a familiar face at these draws, has walked out and the preamble for the Champions League quarter-final draw has started. President Michel Platini, he says, can't be with us today. No reason was given. 

The first legs of this season's Champions League quarter-finals will be played on April 14-15. The second legs will follow a week later on April 21-22.

Now, more than ever, it's all about scoring goals at crucial moments as the Berlin final on June 6 looms on the horizon.

But which of the eight survivors is best-equipped for the challenge? We assess the forward trios of each team.

Bayern Munich are shining bright once more this season but that didn't stop their stars marvelling at a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Bayern trio Pepe Reina, Xabi Alonso and Juan Bernat took time out from training to gaze at the solar eclipse that happened on Friday.

So who are the survivors in this season's UEFA Champions League?

And here's the odds you can get on each team going all the way...

This was the scene above UEFA's base a few minutes ago when the partial eclipse of the sun cast much of Europe into temporary darkness. But for the Premier League, it's a total eclipse in the last eight of the Champions League for the second time in three seasons. 

There may not be any English representatives left in the Champions League this season following our wipeout this week, but the latter stages of Europe's premier competition look as tantalising as ever. 

We have reached the quarter-final stage and, in the next hour or so, we will discover who plays who in the last eight. 

There are three representatives from Spain in the pot - Barcelona, the current league leaders who eliminated Manchester City this week, Real Madrid, the defending champions, and Atletico Madrid, last year's finalists.

From Germany, Bayern Munich, who are tipped by many to lift the trophy on German soil in Berlin on June 6. 

From Italy, the European aristocrats of Juventus. From France, Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain, the sides who dumped out Arsenal and Chelsea respectively.

And, last but certainly not least, Porto. Who needs the Premier League? 

The draw, which takes place at UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, is scheduled to get underway at 11am and you won't miss a thing here.
