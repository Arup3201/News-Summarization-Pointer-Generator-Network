When David Good was a child and people asked about his mother, he'd give them an answer he knew would preclude any further questions: she died in a car crash.

In fact, his mother was alive and well, only instead of baking cookies and helping with homework, she was barefoot and mostly naked, with sticks coming out of piercings in her face, gathering grubworms and roasting boa constrictors deep in the Amazon jungle.

Good's mother was never the suburban mom she tried to be. Her name is Yarima, and she is part of the Yanomami tribe from Venezuela.

Worlds apart: David Good greets his mother Yarima of the Yanomami tribe after an absence of 19 years

'I didn’t want my friends to know that my mom’s a naked jungle woman eating tarantulas,' Good told the New York Post.

'I didn’t want to be known as a half-breed. And it was my revenge; I was angry that she left me. So I just wanted to stick with the story that she was dead.'

Good is one of three children born to Yarima and Kenneth Good, an anthropology professor who encountered the Yanomami more than 30 years ago as a student and returned so frequently that he was regarded as a part of the tribe.

Kenneth Good was supposed to be there for 15 months, but instead became enamored of the culture and spent 12 years there, on and off.

Along with his acceptance into the tribe, Kenneth Good was offered a wife. Although she was only in her early teens, Yarima was promised to Kenneth Good and the two were married.

Kenneth Good eventually returned to the United States, bringing Yarima with him, but it wasn't easy.

Everything
 was alien to the young woman, who had to learn to count because the 
entire Yanomami numerical system consisted one 'one,' 'two,' and 'many.'

Having
 never experienced any type of technology, she was confused and at times
 frightened, believing cars to be ferocious animals and struggling 
through English lessons.

There
 were discoveries too: Yarima loved traffic jams, gold chains, country 
fairs and action films. Kenneth Good once had to cancel the family's 
pay-per-view when he received a sizeable bill because Yarima had watched
 Rocky V seven times.

But
 Yarima felt isolated, spending most of her time in the couple's 
Rutherford, New Jersey, home watching TV, unable to communicate with 
anyone but her husband.

In
 1991, Kenneth Good made a deal with National Geographic to film a 
documentary of the entire family returning to Venezuela, including David
 and his younger siblings Vanessa and Daniel.

Adjustment: Yarima had to adjust to a Western way of life when she moved to New Jersey with Kenneth Good, a task that eventually proved too difficult

While they were there, Yarima made the painful decision not to return to the United States. David was just six.

'After two or three years, I began internalizing it as abandonment,' David Good told the New York Post.

'Sometimes I would bring Yarima up,' Kenneth said. 'And when I did - dead silence. I thought, "Well, that’s strange."'

Once, when David was about 10 years old, his class took a field trip to the Museum of Natural History where he saw a blown-up photo of his mom, taken by his dad on the wall as part of a tribal exhibit.

'I just froze,' David Good told the New York Post. 'All the blood drained out of me. I ran to a dark corner and hid for 10 minutes.'

Finally, after a tumultuous adolescence where he self-medicated with drugs and alcohol and internalized his pain over his mother, David Good read a book his father had written about his experiences with Yarima and the Yanomami tribe called Into the Heart.

He was 20 and finally ready to hear his mother's side of the story.

In 2011, he left to U.S. to visit the Yanomami. It had been 19 years since Good had seen Yarima.

The East Stroudsburg University graduate student didn't know what to expect.

Home: When David Good went to visit his mother, he didn't even know if she was alive and well, because the Yanomami don't have any contact with the world outside their tribe

Prior to that summer trip, it had been years since Good left the United States — the last time as a small child on the fateful trip in which he would lose his mother to her tribe.

The trip to Venezuela involved two years of coordination.

Once there, Good had to navigate the Orinoco River with a tour guide and translator, deep into the Amazonian rainforest, where few outsiders venture.

Living so remotely, Yarima was cut off from all forms of modern communication, and therefore Good had no way of knowing if she was even alive.

The trip changed Good's life.

'That trip was all about uncertainty,' David told the New York Post. 'I didn’t know if she would like me, or if I would like her, or if she would reject me.'

When she emerged from the jungle, David recognized his mother's face immediately.

He didn't hug or kiss her - it's not the Yanomami way - but he told her something he'd wanted to say for years.

'I said, "Mama, I made it, I’m home. It took so long, but I made it."' They both cried.

Good, then 27, was exposed to a way of life he never experienced in the United States.

He was struck by the bare-bones nature of the tribe.

Everything in their lives — food, shelter, the baskets they weave and arrows they make — comes from the land.

In the middle of the rainforest, without the distractions of technology and demands of a global society, there was only the 'simple essence of human communication,' Good explained.

Good has since made it his mission to address the needs of indigenous groups like the Yanomami, and to educate the world about their way of life.

'I want to rectify the world's image of them. You still hear so many stereotypes, like they are "primitive,"' Good said.

Bridging the gap: In his unique position as a Western Yanomami, Good is helping to preserve the culture while bringing in necessities such as medicine

In August, he started The Good Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to these goals.

The organization is part of ESU's Business Accelerator. In December, the group registered as a nonprofit in Pennsylvania, and it is applying for its 501(c)(3) status.

In November, Good did make another return trip to the Amazon, staying in his mother's village, Irokai-Teri, for more than a month.

He also took a weeklong trip to Costa Rica to study and visit with the Cabecar tribe, one of the most remote groups in Costa Rica.

On May 24, he left for his first official trip with The Good Project, returning to the Cabecar village along with four ESU students to continue his outreach there.

Right now, he plans to focus The Good Project's mission specifically on these two tribes.

It's really difficult for remote populations such as the Cabecar and Yanomami to receive basic necessities like clothing and medicine.

Good hopes to bring supplies to these groups, but also wants to help preserve the Cabecar and Yanomami way of life and find out exactly what the tribes' people need.

He is interested in ethnography — staying with the tribes for an extended period of time to 'walk in their shoes' and learn about their daily struggles.

While Good doesn't plan to spend as much time in the villages as his father did with the Yanomami, he would like to take extended trips between three to six months.

He also hopes to bring others with him, particularly people in the Poconos.

The group of ESU students traveling to Costa Rica in May is a diverse one, 'which is exactly what I wanted,' Good said.

The group consists of a nursing major, biology major, math major and computer science major.

For an outsider, experiencing a third world culture for the first time is shocking, he said.

'As Americans, we just want to figure out how to go at them and solve them, but they aren't really poor in spirit,' Good said of the remote tribes.

The tribes are free from many problems faced by modern society, such as depression, suicide and even diseases like cancer.

In fact, Good says he feels happiest at home in the Amazon rainforest.

'I never felt any happier than being alone in my hammock, rocking next to the fire at the end of a hard day's work in the garden,' he said. 'They are self-sufficient, they just live with less.'

When he's with his mother, he lives just as she does.

'My dad tells me not to walk around barefoot in my underwear, but I want to,' David says. He eats grub worms, termites, boa constrictors, monkeys, armadillo.

'I really want to be Yanomami,' David says. 'I want to trek through the jungle like they do.'

He and Yarima are slowly building a relationship after so many years and a culture apart.

'It’s not like there’s closure,' David said. 'We’re at the beginning of our story, in so many ways.'
