Comedian Eddie Large has spoken of how he nearly died after tripping over a road sign near his home.

Eddie, one half of TV double act Little and Large, suffered three broken ribs and a collapsed lung following the fall in Portishead, near Bristol, in November last year.

He was taken to hospital, but took a turn for the worse when he contracted pneumonia.

Incident: The comedian suffered three broken ribs and a collapsed lung after falling on the sign's hinged stand

Doctors then discovered he had pancreatitis - leaving him battling for life in intensive care and a high dependency unit.

But after three months of treatment, the 72-year-old comic has finally been allowed to return home.

'I feel very, very weak but I am really pleased to be home,' said Eddie yesterday. 'It was a nightmare because they had to bring me back from the brink.

'A nurse told me "You are doing really well because we nearly lost you last week".'

Eddie, who is the oldest heart transplant survivor in the country, tripped over the sign after it was left lying flat in the middle of a road near his waterfront apartment.

However, instead of falling on to the ground, he landed on the sign's upturned hinged stand which holds it in position.

He was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary, where his collapsed lung triggered pancreatitis - an inflammation of the pancreas which can prove fatal.

Praise: The comedian said Bristol Royal Infirmary's nurses and doctors provided an 'amazing' level of care

He was also diagnosed with pneumonia, and suffered an allergic reaction to the painkillers he was given.

Eddie said the hospital's nurses and doctors had saved his life - adding: 'I just can't praise them highly enough.

'The NHS is frequently maligned but I was amazed at the level of care and the facilities.'

Home again: Eddie, pictured with his wife Patsy, is now back home, but still receives daily visits from a nurse

Now back home with his wife Patsy, Eddie receives a daily visit from a nurse and is undertaking a course of physiotherapy.

He can walk small distances, but suffers from dizziness if he stands up too quickly due to high blood pressure.

However, the avid Manchester City fan is not letting his condition stop him from enjoying football matches.

Eddie said he had not been able to resist celebrating Yaya Toure's wonder goal against Sunderland in last Sunday's Capital One Cup victory.

He said he had leapt out of his chair with a whoop of joy - before feeling a rush of blood to his head which made him dizzy.

'I couldn't resist it because it was a great goal,' he said. 'But it got me a ticking off from the missus.'
