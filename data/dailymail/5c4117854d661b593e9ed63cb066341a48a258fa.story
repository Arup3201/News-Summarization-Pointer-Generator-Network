An archaeological site excavated by Lawrence of Arabia more than 100 years ago is set to open as a tourist attraction despite being metres from ISIS territory.

The site of biblical Carchemish was once fought over by the likes of the Babylonians and the Egyptians, but now it is the battleground of ISIS, the Assad regime and the Free Syrian Army.

The city was lost for centuries but was rediscovered by British scholars in the 19th century and excavated by Lawrence of Arabia shortly before the First World War.

Now, just metres from the front line, the historic town on the Turkish-Syrian border is set to open to the public.

Battleground: The ISIS flag flies above a building which overlooks the biblical site of Carchemish, excavated by Lawrence of Arabia and now set to become a tourist attraction

Lawrence of Arabia was among the first dig team to excavate the historic site after it was uncovered in the 19th century

Now, one hundred years after T.E. Lawrence left Carchemis, the site is being excavated by a group of Italian archaelogists

The archaeological site lies on Syrian-Turkish border and is in an area under the control of militant group ISIS

The archaeological site lies just 20 metres away from the border, with a 13ft high blast wall to be built to block the view, and the line of fire, to and from Syria.

Carchemish, which lies between the modern towns of Karkamis and Jarablus, straddles the border between Turkey and Syria. The Syrian side has been excavated since 2011 but the Turkish side is cut off because of its dangerous location.

The old Tel, or hill, in the middle of the town is a Turkish army look-out point and has been a military outpost for 5,000 years.

Professor Nicolo Marchetti, the leader of the dig team from Bologna University, told the Telegraph: 'To be frank it's been a front line - over the border 20 metres away we see normal life and we also see these people [ISIS] coming and going.

'We hear the shooting at the front in the distance and in September it was quite close to us - perhaps two kilometres away. But it's still very different from what's going on in Kobane.

'Still, we have had no problem at all. We work in a military area. It is very well protected.' 

Professor Nicolo Marchetti is leading the dig at the site, which lies just 20 metres from the border with Syria 

Prof Marchetti said he hoped the area could be opened up for tourists by next spring - despite it neighbouring ISIS territory

Turkish authorities allowed researchers to access the site in 2011 for the first time in more than 90 years 

Almost a century ago, Lawrence of Arabia spent time excavating the historically important site in Turkey. Now his house on the site is being excavated itself

Turkish authorities say tourists will not be put in danger by visiting the site, despite the fact ISIS are just metres away and the border is guarded by 500 Turkish soldiers and heavy artillery

The town, on the border between the two nations, has been fought over by ISIS, Assad's Syrian regime and the Free Syrian Army in recent years 

Nearby town Jarablus has been a battleground for the last few years, firstly when it was seized by the Free Syrian Army.

Since then it has been bombed by the Syrian air force and overrun by ISIS, who have beheaded people with links to rebel forces.

The area is guarded by 500 Turkish soldiers and is covered by artillery. 

Despite the soon-to-be tourist attraction's nearby dangers, Turkish authorities say visitors have nothing to fear.

District governor Yusuf Osman Diktas said he did not expect any danger 'for now'. 

British George Smith recognised the small town in 1876, but died shortly afterwards.

Decades later TE Lawrence, then 23, and an excavation team were given permission to dig.

Among the artifacts uncovered at the site is this Roman statue which now lies at the Archaeology Museum in Gaziantep, Turkey

Despite the danger posed by the ISIS fanatics just a few metres away, archaeologists continued their work

Excavated: Among the artifacts recovered from the site is this bath tub and a pair of ancient jugs

The area around the ancient city had been off-limits to archaeologists for more than 90 years until 2011

The Syrian side has been excavated since 2011 but the Turkish side is cut off because of its dangerous location 

Intricate basalt reliefs showing ancient deities were found, some of which are now on display at the British Museum, before the team left after the outbreak of WWI.

Lawrence's house on the site is now being excavated and is thought be where he learned Arabic and began his obsession with the Middle East.

Underneath the floorboards, the dig team found hundreds of stone inscriptions and small statues, which, fortunately, had not been damaged by soldiers who used the house after Lawrence left. 

Lawrence's house, once restored, will be the focal point of the site when tourists begin to visit the site in spring next year. 

A letter from the British Army officer to his mother is one of the relics that will be put on display.

Prof Marchetti said: 'When you reflect on the contemporary history here, you see this site is also a powerful symbol.'
