A Hull City fan has demanded the club makes an official complaint to UEFA after his son was one of many away fans allegedly attacked with bottles by Lokeren supporters following their Europa League tie on Thursday night. 

At present there are unconfirmed reports that six supporters were taken to hospital as a result of their injuries. 

Craig Harper of Heckmondwike, West Yorkshire; claims his teenage son was left with a bloodied head injury after being pelted by a glass bottle in the Belgian municipality.

Under siege: Hull supporters say they were pelted by bottles whilst police did nothing

‘I looked round and his head was covered in blood,’ he told the Hull Daily Mail. ‘I was screaming at the police for first aid for him and they did absolutely nothing, they just looked at us. ‘

We were trying to get away and they just kept us all together, taking us down this little street. There were grandmas and grandads and kids in the crowd. 

‘Something needs to be done, the club should make an official complaint to UEFA.’ 

Mr Harper wasn’t the only travelling Hull fan to vent his anger at the violence. 

Many fans took to social media to criticise the Belgian police, with supporters group Amber Nectar reporting that travelling Tigers had been ‘needlessly kettled’ by police in full riot gear as they left the ground. 

Video footage of the violence was also caught and uploaded to Instagram by a few Hull supporters. 

Lokeren fans have apologised to City supporters and blamed a small minority of troublemakers.

Hans De Vylder, a Lokeren fan who watched the match, said the atmosphere both before and during the game had been excellent. 

He said: ‘I feel very sorry about what happened for the impeccable Hull City fans who were at the game, who were at the market place during the day, drinking beers and soft drinks, having fun, enjoying the day in Lokeren and the evening at Daknamstadium. 

‘99.99 per cent of Lokeren fans are just football fans who don’t want to quarrel at all!’
