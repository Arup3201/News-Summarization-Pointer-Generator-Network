With festival season fast upon us, thoughts turn to fedoras, fringed waistcoats and Wellington boots.

If you can't quite afford Kate Moss' range at Topshop but still want to give festival stalwart Vanessa Hudgens a run for her money in the fashion stakes, Primark has it covered.

The cheap and chic high street giant has unveiled its SS14 festival range and there's enough crochet, kimono jackets and lace to take you from Wireless through to Global Gathering - all priced between £1.50 to £23.

Festival chic: Primark, which is known for 
offering stylish clothes at an affordable price, has unveiled a new 
capsule collection filled with festival looks (left: dress, £12, bag, £4, and right, top, £14, shorts, £10)

The capsule range, which is called Boho Grunge and launches in stores nationwide today, aims to celebrate the 'carefree, hippie nostalgia of long, balmy summers and the tunes that make the trends during festival season at home and abroad', says the store.

The collection is full of clashing prints and plenty of distressed denim, while billowing midi dresses and silken kimono jackets aim to add a touch of glamour to any festival-goers outfit.

Festival feel: The capsule collection is full of distressed denim, crochet tops and plenty of fringing (left: T-shirt, £4, shorts, £10, and right: dress, £13, bag, £9)

Something for the boys, too: Slogan T-shirts and mid-length denim shorts make up the menswear range (left: T-shirt, £7, shorts, £10, trainers, £8, centre: vest, £6, skirt, £8, boots, £15 and right: top, £14, shorts, £10 and jacket, £9)

Accessories come in the form of fedora hats, embellished backpacks and buckled boots and garments are given a boho finish with hand-stitched crochets and bleaching.

Speaking about the range, fashion blogger Lydia Faye Jones said: 'Primark has pulled it out of the bag with its capsule festival collection.

'The range offers stylish but affordable clothes, so it doesn't matter if you get a bit of mud on them.

'The cool denim is perfect for all-night ravers, while the feminine midis will look amazing teamed with a floral garland and stacks of gold jewellery.'

Expansion: There are now 269 Primark stores covering nearly 10 million square feet of selling space across nine European countries (top, £4, necklace, £8)

Glam: As well as cool denims, Primark has included more feminine and glamorous dresses and crop jackets into the range (left: jacket, £23, vest, £3, shorts, £10, and right: dress, £12, bag, £4, headband, £3)

The range comes as Primark saw its profits soar by 26 per cent to £298million in just six months.

Parent
 company Associated British Foods (ABF) put the chain's success down to 
its rapid expansion after several new stores were launched last year.

There
 are now 269 Primark stores covering nearly 10 million square feet of 
selling space across nine European countries - with the company now 
hoping to launch in the US.

It
 plans to open a 70,000 square-foot store in Boston next year with 
negotiations under way to open further stores in the north east of the 
country in 2016.

Primark's expansion
in the UK has been focused on increasing selling space in major cities,
with the opening of its second store in London's Oxford Street and 
extensions to shops in Newcastle and Manchester.

Big plans: The new range comes at the same time as Primark revealed it plans to open a 70,000 square-foot store in Boston next year (top, £10, shorts, £10, boots, £15, bag, £14)
