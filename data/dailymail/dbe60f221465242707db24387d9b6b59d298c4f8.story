When it comes to online dating, if only there were a way of skipping through the sleazy messages, past the late-night chats that lead nowhere and, worst of all, beyond that tireless trawl of hoping the next head-shot to pop up is your happily ever after.

Well apparently there is - and it involves outsourcing.

Meet Espree Devora, an LA-based self-titled entrepreneur and self-confessed 'super nerd' who decided she was too busy to waste 'several hours a week' trying to find a man online.

So since since March, she has had an assistant do it on her behalf.

'I’m a passionate entrepreneur obsessed with being resourceful and productive so I like to spend my time working on my company rather than emailing with strangers,' Devora told Kernel Mag.

'A lot of these guys send me ridiculous waste of time emails so why not have someone else weed through it all?'

Time-poor: Espree Devora, an LA entrepreneur, has had her assistant manage numerous online dating profiles for her since March. Now, not happy with the subsequent 'blind dates', she is taking out a Facebook ad leading men to a page describing exactly who she is and exactly what she wants. This is the main picture on that page

The process is simple, according to Devora, who maintains she is not deceiving any of her respective dates.

'My remote assistant logs into multiple online dating accounts that are mine and finds guys she thinks would be a good fit for me,' she said.

'She emails them saying she thinks her boss and the potential guy would get along well and should meet.

'If he’s interested, the guy and she set up the date and I simply show up.

'She is 100% honest and doesn’t pretend to be me or anything.

'Honesty is important to me.'

'Super fun': Espree Devora has been blogging about her experiences anonymously on a site called Outsourcing Your Love Life

By not having to do any of the work herself, the pursuit also means each date is a blind one.

'I am really open minded,' Devora said.

'I don’t look at any of the profiles so for me all the dates are blind dates.

'I have nothing to lose, only a potential wonderful relationship to gain.

'Some guys may not be the types I would have chosen for myself, but it could work.

'It’s an adventure and I meet awesome people. '

However, despite such an extravagant means, the new-gen hunt for Mr Right has so far not worked.

Devora says she now doesn't want to wait for the guys to respond to her assistant.

And so nother new plan has been hatched to use a paid Facebook ad to promote her 'single and ready to mingle status'.

Plan B: Espree Devora now intends to turn Facebook into her own online dating profile, paying for ad that will link interested guys to a page all about her

The ad will link to a page that will detail the many aspects of her life, such as her love of skateboarding, indie movies and 6am workouts.

It will also include links to places where men interested can 'cyber stalk' her, such as Twitter.

There are also quotes from friends and family describing what Devora is like.

The standout is from 'Canadian best friend' Liam Martin, who said: 'Hold on tight, Espree is a wild ride.'
