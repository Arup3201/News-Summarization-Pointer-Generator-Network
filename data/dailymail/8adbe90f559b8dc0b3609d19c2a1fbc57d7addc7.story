High social status has its privileges - even in wild animals.

Researchers studying spotted hyenas in Kenya found that high-ranking members of a clan live longer, are healthier and even have more offspring.

The discovery was made by analysing the lengths of telomeres - caps at the end of each strand of DNA - regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species, including humans.

Nora Lewin from Michigan State Univerity's zoology department  said: 'If you want to see the hierarchy of spotted hyenas, throw down some fresh meat near them. 

'It's quickly apparent who's dominant and who's not.'

But she wanted to know if these long-accepted biological markers would support what she was seeing in the field.

Ms Lewin worked with fellow lead author and MSU zoologist Kay Holekamp to study more than 25 years of data on hyenas across the African country. 

Telomeres are caps at the end of each strand of DNA that protect chromosomes from deterioration.

These biomarkers are regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species, including humans.  

Shrinking telomeres are a signal that cells are sliding into 'defensive mode', stressful actions that could soon lead to cells' - and to the person or animal's - death.

High-ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers.

In young humans, telomeres are about 8,000-10,000 nucleotides long. 

They shorten with each cell division, however, and when they reach a critical length the cell stops dividing or dies. 

This internal 'clock' makes it difficult to keep most cells growing in a laboratory for more than a few cell doublings. 

She also spent a summer in Kenya observing hyenas' social structure.

The team of researchers focused on telomeres, caps that protect chromosomes from deterioration.

High-ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers suggesting they were healthier.

Group membership significantly predicted telomere length of those female hyenas that sat at the top of the social hierarchy.

But Ms Lewin also noted a couple of interesting twists. 

The alpha females of each clan had the longest telomeres. 

However, the length was relative to each individual clan. 

This meant that if researchers found a lone hyena wandering the savanna they couldn't simply identify it as an alpha female based solely on telomere length.

Also the team was able to rule other factors that could possibly influence telomere length such as abundance of food - which could be linked to better overall health.

Although the alpha females of each clan had the longest telomeres, the length was relative to each individual clan so telomeres couldn't be used to identify leaders when on their own. The team was able to rule out factors that could possibly influence telomere length such as abundance of food

Its research found no correlation between the amount of food and the size of the biological marker. 

'This work shows, for the first time, the effects of social rank on telomere length in wild mammals,' Ms Lewin said.

'This enhances our understanding of how social and ecological variables may contribute to age-related declines of hyenas, and in organisms in general.'

'The fact that there is variation in telomere length when prey abundance is constant means that there are other factors we need to find.

'We think it's less about genetics and more influenced by the environment, but we just need to keep searching for the right environmental factors.'

The results are published in the journal of Biology Letters.
