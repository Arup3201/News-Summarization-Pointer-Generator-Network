The Queen has arrived in the centre of Paris to have a flower market renamed in her honour, marking the end of a three-day state visit to France.

Yesterday on the 70th anniversary of the 
D-Day landings, she spoke of her pride at the courage of the Allied
 forces who invaded Europe on June 6, 1944.

Now the people of Paris have given the monarch her very own tribute by renaming the market near Notre Dame Cathedral as Marche aux Fleurs - Reine Elizabeth II.

Royal accolade: The Queen arrives at City Hall, along side Paris' mayor Anne Hidalgo, where she will have a flower market named in her honour 

She arrived at city hall alongside the Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, on the last day of her tour with the Duke of Edinburgh.

Also at the flower market will by Olympic Gold medallist Sir Bradley Wiggins, the first Briton to win the Tour de France. He will be with a team of charity cyclists who are supporting the Forces' organisation Help For Heroes.

In unprecedented scenes in an area eternally associated with the French Revolution of 1789, Her Majesty received the honour from the city's Mayor

'This reflects the enormous affection of Parisians. It gives me great joy to give this lovely flower market your name,' said Ms Hidalgo, as a clearly moved Queen and Prince Philip looked on.

They were completing the last day of a hugely successful State Visit, which included attending the D-Day 70th anniversary commemorations in Normandy on Friday.

The new square, opposite the city's law courts and close to Notre Dame Cathedral, will now be called 'Marche aux Fleurs- Reine Elizabeth II' - or 'Flower Market - Queen Elizabeth II'.

Entrance: The monarch walked down a red carpet, followed by her husband The Duke of Edinburgh, the day after she led tributes on the 70th anniversary of D-Day

People of Paris: She was greeted by a large crowd near the Notre Dame Cathedral. Behind her, Prince Philip speaks to Paris deputy mayor Bruno Julliard

Despite the excited crowds cheering 
on the Queen, who was dressed in light pink dress and hat, not everybody
 was happy about the new name.

Left
 wing councillors said it was 'ridiculous' that an unelected monarch was
 getting such an accolade in a republic which executed most of its 
royals more than 200 years ago.

They
 are particularly angry because the decision was approved by two 
Socialists - Ms Hidalgo and President Francois Hollande, who also 
attended this morning's ceremony.

Danielle
 Simonnet, a councillor representing the Party of the Left (PG) 
suggested that it would have been far better to honour a 'hero' of the 
1789 French Revolution, such as Maximilien de Robespierre.

Ms
 Simonnet said: 'Without any sign of a vote, Paris honours the Queen of 
England while the city is still not capable of honouring a French figure
 of the Revolution such as Robspierre.'

Ms
 Simonnet was also angry that Ms Hidalgo had paid tribute to abdicating 
King Juan Carlos of Spain earlier this week, with the Queen's new market
 topping a terrible week for republicanism.

She
 said: 'Frankly, the mayor of the City of Light, of the capital of the 
great French Revolution, can't it send out a message more republican 
that this one of deference to the royal vestiges of the old Europe?'

Jean-Bernard Bros, of the PRG Radical Party of the Left, tweeted that the decision to honour the Queen was 'questionable'.

Banquet: Last night she attended a state dinner at the Elysee presidential palace with French President Francois Hollande alongside Prince Philip

The
 flower and bird market has been a Paris landmark since it was first set
 up in 1808, on the Ile de la Citi - the island in the Seine where 
ancient Paris was founded.

It
 remains the heart of Paris, and is just across the road from the 
Conciergerie, the former prison where Marie Antoinette, the last 
pre-Revolutionary Queen of France, was held as Prisoner No. 280 before 
she was guillotined in 1793.

Despite
 the row, flower stall workers said they were delighted by the new name.
 'It's a great honour - we are super happy that our market will now be 
named after the Queen,' said Ahmel Ganot, 49.

Elizabeth
 first came to Paris in 1948 as a newlywed Princess, and as Queen had 
previously visited in 1957, 1972, 1992 and in 2004. This
 time, she arrived by Eurostar on Thursday, before visiting landmarks 
including the Arc de Triomphe, where she laid a wreath at the Tomb of 
the Unknown Soldier.

Sharing a joke: During the international ceremony on Sword Beach in Ouistreham, Normandy, yesterday, she was seen laughing during a conversation with Danish Queen Margrethe

Remembrance: After laying a wreath at the British war cemetery in Bayeux, she steps back and bows as she remembers the soldiers who fell on the Longest Day in 1944

Following the anniversary commemorations in Normandy on Friday, she attended a state banquet hosted by President Hollande.

In
 a hugely warm and affectionate toast, he described the Queen as someone
 who personified the saying 'Keep calm and carry on' - a phrase he 
repeated in French and English.

The
 Queen, in turn, delivered a whole speech alternating between the two 
languages, as she recalled her first visit to Paris as a newlywed in 
1948 'just four years after D-Day'.

She
 said she retained a 'great affection for the French people' and 
expressed 'sorrow and regret' about those whose lives were lost fighting
 for freedom during the Second World War.

Her Majesty said that both Britain and France still had a 'particular role' to ensure 'peace and security around the world.'

The
 Queen quoted from Rudyard Kipling's poem, France, saying: 'First to 
follow Truth and last to leave Old Truths behind - France beloved of 
every soul that loves its fellow-kind!'

After
 their visit to the flower market today, the Queen and Prince Philip 
returned by plane to Britain, where they are expected to attend the 
Derby horse race at Epsom.

The Queen travelled
 to the French coast with the Duke and spent the day with other heads of
 state honouring the actions of veterans and their fallen comrades.
