Reality TV stars certainly know how to sell fitness DVDs.

As Britain gets back into shape following the festive binge, sales of celebrity fitness DVDs have shot up with Vicky Pattinson of Geordie Shore proving the most popular.

The Newcastle-born reality star even managed to see off competition from the ever-popular Davina McCall as well as last year's winner - Jillian Michaels: 30 Day Shred.

In fourth place was another reality TV star, Big Brother's Josie Gibson, who also managed a sixth place entry with a second effort.

While celebrity DVDs have proven popular yet again, according to sales figures released by Amazon, traditional fitness products have also enjoyed a sales boom.

Top selling products include the Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity Tracker, which takes the number one spot, and a £67 wrist gizmo which tracks steps, distance and calories burned.

Progress trackers and 
pedometers also proved popular, as did gym equipment such as dumbbells and at-home exercise bars.

But not everyone is attempting to get
 in shape just yet. According to Amazon, New Year's fitness 
resolutions don't kick in in earnest until January 26, or 'Shape-up Sunday', when they expect peak sales of exercise equipment.

The
 reason for the sudden urge to get in shape, says the retailer, is because it is precisely one month after Boxing Day
 and comes just after the first pay cheque of the year arrives.

'The surge in sales of fitness 
equipment on Shape-up Sunday suggests that good intentions for getting 
fit and healthy kick in a little later in January once all the 
festivities are finished,' revealed a spokesperson.

'In
 particular, we're seeing customers stock up on home work-out equipment 
as an affordable and convenient alternative to going to the gym.'
