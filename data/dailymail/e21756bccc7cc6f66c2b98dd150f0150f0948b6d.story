Suzanne Morgan said some pupils were 'a little more than obsessed' with computer games

A primary school headteacher - fed up with sleepy pupils - has written an open letter to parents warning of the dangers of online gaming and allowing late night television in bedrooms after children in her school were 'ready for bed' by midday.

Suzanne Morgan, headteacher at Saltdean Primary School in Brighton, East Sussex, wrote a letter on the school website addressed to 'parents, carers and children'.

In the letter she claims some pupils were 'a little more than obsessed' with computer games and admitted to playing them 'late into the night'.Â 

The letter goes on: 'This lack of sleep becomes cumulative and it is very difficult for staff to inspire learning from children who by 12 o'clock are ready to go to sleep.'

She adds that the teachers are greeted with 'tired looks' in the morning.

Mrs Morgan also highlights the problem with allowing children having televisions in their rooms: 'As more children have televisions in their rooms, we are finding that some are also watching TV until late.'

She also writes to parents directly: 'Obviously, we can only talk to children about good habits and about the need for a definitive amount of sleep at their age.

'We need cooperation of parents and carers to ensure that all our children arrive at school in the best possible frame of mind for learning.'

Georgie Kennedy from Brighton and Hove Parents' Forum said parents needed to take action.

She said: 'There is a huge danger with online games.

'There are all sorts of things online especially if these children are accessing it in their bedrooms.

'And in the virtual reality world they lose out on interacting with others. If there is no discipline in the home how will they get on in later life?

Mrs Morgan urged parents to 'shut down computers and television at a reasonable time'

'Everyone needs to hear 'no' at some point.'

The news comes after another primary school in Sussex issues a warning to parents about children playing in violent video games.

Meeching Valley Primary School in Newhaven said last month that children as young as seven or eight were acting out on-screen violence in the playground.

Primary school children range from age 4 to 11.

It has come to my attention that some of our older 
pupils are a little more than obsessed with various computer games.

Some
 are admitting to playing these late into the night, especially the 
'live' versions on line, hence the extremely tired looks we are greeted 
with in the mornings.

This
 lack of sleep becomes cumulative and it is very difficult for staff to 
inspire learning from children who by 12 o'clock are ready to go to 
sleep.

As more 
children have televisions in their rooms, we are finding that some are 
also watching TV until late. It is also affecting punctuality for a few 
pupils who are simply not waking up early enough to get here on time.

They haven't realised the need for a time gap between playing a game or watching TV, and settling to sleep.

Obviously, we can only talk to children about good habits and about the need for a definitive amount of sleep at their age.

We
 need cooperation of parents and carers to ensure that all our children 
arrive at school in the best possible frame of mind for learning.

We therefore ask that you monitor use of TV and games and ensure that they are shutting them down at a reasonable time.

This
 is particularly important for Year 6 from now on as they need to be 
fully focused during the day.

I empathise with parents and carers, 
having gone through many battles of wills with my own children - they 
won't thank you for it at the time, but they will later.
