He was born on Monday afternoon, but it wasn't until yesterday evening that we got the first glimpse of Baby Cambridge, held by his proud parents Kate and William.

To us, he just looked like a scrunched up little ball of baby, but to them he is the most beautiful thing in the whole world, and no doubt they have spent their private time with him trying to see if he has Elizabeth's nose, Charles' eyes, Carole's ears and Pippa's fingers.

FEMAIL has put together a family album of royal baby photos... so who do you think the new addition most resembles?

Spot the family resemblance? Baby Cambridge, left, the day after his birth, and the Queen at Royal Ascot in June, right

Baby Cambridge was born on 22 July, 2013, at 16.24, weighing 8lbs 6oz.

According to his father Prince William: 'He's a big boy, he's quite heavy.'

In fact, the not-so-little prince is the heaviest royal baby on record. So how do his relatives compare?

Does William and Kate's son have the Queen's nose or Charles' mouth?
