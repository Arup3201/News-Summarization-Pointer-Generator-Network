Britain is to give £5million to help efforts to defeat terror group Boko Haram, it emerged today.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the money would support a new regional task force designed to target the Islamic extremists in northern Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin area.

It came as the Nigerian military said it has destroyed the headquarters of Boko Haram in the barbaric terrorist organisation's de facto capital city Gwoza.

Mr Hammond said 'important gains' were being made in taking on Boko Haram, as talks were being held in at the UN in New York.

Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Benin will contribute to the task force, which has been authorised by the African Union.

Talks are taking place in New York to endorse the unit via a United Nations' security resolution.

Mr Hammond said: 'The UK fully supports the efforts of Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Benin to tackle the scourge of Boko Haram.

'I hope that the international community can send an important message of support through the swift adoption of a security council resolution in New York to welcome the force.

'Important gains are already being made on the ground in tackling Boko Haram by the regional partners who will contribute to the task force.

'It will continue to play an important role in fighting this terrorist insurgency. I commend the commitment and bravery of the troops involved.

'The UK continues to stand strong with Nigeria and its neighbours in tackling this heinous group.' 

Earlier this week it emerged that Boko Haram had abducted hundreds of women and children  from primary schools  to use them as 'human shields'.

The Islamic militants took adults and children from primary schools in the north-eastern town of Damasak as troops from Niger and Chad approached a month ago, Mike Omeri, the Nigerian spokesman for the fight against Boko Haram, confirmed this week.

When the soldiers arrived, they found the town largely deserted - with local reports suggesting as many as 500 people were taken in the raids.

Today the official Twitter account for the Nigerian Defense Headquarters announced 'FLASH: Troops this morning captured Gwoza destroying the Headquarters of the Terrorists self-styled Caliphate.'

It followed with 'Several terrorists died while many are captured. Mopping up of entire #Gwoza and her suburbs is ongoing.' 

Boko Haram chief Abubakar Shekau declared the northeast Nigerian city to be the capital of a new Islamic caliphate after he seized the town in August. Earlier this month Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, formally recognising Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as their spiritual leader.

It was not possible to verify this morning's morale-boosting announcement, which comes just one day before critical presidential elections in Nigeria.

The Twitter messages made no mention  of military operations in Sambisa Forest, where Nigeria's home-grown Islamic extremist group is believed to have several camps.

Warplanes have been bombarding the area for weeks. The forest starts about 20 miles from Gwoza town, which is 80 miles southeast of Maiduguri - the Borno state capital state and Boko Haram's birthplace.
