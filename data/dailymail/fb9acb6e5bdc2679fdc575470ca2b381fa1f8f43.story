Wayne Marlon Jones, 53, bishop at United Spiritual Baptist Church in Canada has been charged with sexual assault and three counts of fraud more than $5,000

A Canadian pastor has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman during 'spiritual guidance' sessions when he performed exorcisms on her.

Wayne Marlon Jones from United Spiritual Baptist Church in Scarborough, Toronto, is also accused of convincing her to give him money and property, according to police.

The 53-year-old, who was arrested last August, has been charged with sexual assault and three counts of fraud over $5,000.

Jones, allegedly assaulted the woman during sessions from May 2011 to May 2013, according to the Toronto Sun. He was arrested on August 31.

Originally from Trinidad and Tobago, the married man is named as bishop of the church which was founded in June 2000.

Residents in the area said the church, located in a bungalow, had been operating for seven years but was vacated last August after there were disputes with both the city and the municipal board.

However previously during Sunday services, the church would have nearly 30 cars filling the streets as both adult members and children attended sermons.

Neighbor Sue Lamonday, 60, who lives across the street from the church said weird things go on there.

She said: 'It didn't make sense people would be there at 2 a.m. until 4, 5, 6 a.m. I walked by last summer and heard (a man) screaming, 'God is going to save you from the fires of hell if you hand over your help any way you can.'

Police believe there may be more victims and are encouraging anyone with information to come forward.Â 

The investigation is ongoing and Jones is set to appear in Old City Hall court on February 11.

He has been accused of assaulting the woman during sessions from May 2011 to May 2013. The church was founded in 2002 and is operated out of a bungalow in Scarborough (above)
