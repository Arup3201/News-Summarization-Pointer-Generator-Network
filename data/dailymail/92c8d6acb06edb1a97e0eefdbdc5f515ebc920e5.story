A study predicts net migration from inside Europe will be 130,000 every year if current trends continue. Pictured, Romanian passengers aboard a bus, leaving Bucharest, to take them to the United Kingdom in January

Immigration from the EU will add the equivalent of a city as big as Manchester to the UK’s population every four years, a report warns today.

The study predicts net migration from inside Europe will be 130,000 every year if current trends continue.

This total includes 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians and 40,000 from Poland and the seven other Eastern European nations which joined the EU in 2004.

On January 1, Britain lifted all restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK. No figures are yet available for how many have arrived since that date.

However, in the year to September 2013 there were 24,000 arrivals and around 140,000 were already working in the UK at the start of the year. The remainder of the predicted migrants are expected to come from the so-called ‘old’ EU – including large numbers from Greece, Spain and Italy fleeing the eurozone disaster.

Experts say that within years EU immigration could overtake that from the rest of the world as the main source of arrivals to Britain.

MigrationWatch compiled the figures from official Government sources.

The campaign group said one of the major pull factors to the UK was the generous system of in-work benefits, such as tax credits.

A migrant with no dependants earning the minimum wage has their net income of around £184 a week boosted to £254 by tax credits and housing benefit.

In effect, State support makes up 28 per cent of their final take-home pay of £13,218 a year.

If the migrant has a partner and two children, the net weekly income rockets from £184 to £543. State handouts constitute 66 per cent of a total annual income of £28,241.

MigrationWatch said ministers should consider denying migrants access to in-work benefits and tax credits for the first five years they are here.

Under the current regime, a single worker on the minimum wage in the UK would be able to earn four-and-a-half times the income they could earn in Romania – or nine times as much for a family.

Any attempt to treat EU migrants differently to British citizens, who receive the same level of tax credits and other benefits, would spark a huge row with Brussels. The European Commission is already dragging Westminster to court over the so-called ‘right to reside’ test.

But the UK may hope to secure an ally in Germany, which last week signalled its own intention to take a tougher line on EU immigration.

Last night, Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said: ‘The good news is that immigration from outside the EU is coming down steadily as the Government has promised. The bad news is that migrants from the EU have driven the policy off course.

‘It was crazy to have opened up our labour market and our benefit system to 100million people from countries with a standard of living less than a quarter of our own.

‘There must now be a determined renegotiation.’

To date, Government efforts to control EU immigration have focused on access to out-of-work benefits, such as Jobseeker’s Allowance. But the MigrationWatch study points out that migrants from the EU have one of the highest employment rates of all groups in the UK.

Some 79 per cent of Eastern European migrants – known as EU8 or A8 workers – are in employment, compared to 71 per cent of the UK population as a whole.

However, the report states: ‘This should not be used as an indication of the extent to which they are actually able to maintain themselves and their families in  the UK.

‘EU8 migrants have on average lower wages, many are employed at no more than minimum wage and many declare themselves self-employed with little evidence of income at even minimum- wage levels.

‘At this level, both employees and self-employed are heavily subsidised by the taxpayer through in-work benefits and tax credits.’

Earlier this year, the Tories were dealt a huge blow by figures showing total net migration – the difference between the number of people arriving in the UK and  those leaving – had rocketed by 60,000 to 212,000 in the year to September 2013.

It was driven entirely by a 40 per cent leap in the number of people taking advantage of EU edicts on free movement.The shock increase left Downing Street unable to say if David Cameron would meet his key election promise to slash net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by 2015.

MigrationWatch said that, based on current trends, non-EU net migration could fall to just 100,000 and be taken over by arrivals from the EU as the main source of  net migration.

Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘Our reforms have cut non-EU migration to its lowest level since 1998 and there are now 82,000 fewer people arriving annually from outside the EU than when this government came to power.

‘We are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between EU member states and ensuring that controls on benefits and services, including the NHS and social housing, are among the tightest in Europe.

‘But as long as there are huge economic disparities in the EU, there will be an overwhelming incentive for people to move.

‘In future, we must slow full access to labour markets until we can be sure it will not lead to mass migration – for example, by requiring new member states to reach a certain level of income or economic output per head before full free movement is allowed.’
