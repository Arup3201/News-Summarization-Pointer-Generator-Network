He can count international popstar Katy Perry among his fans and has two Guinness World Records to his name, but this pooch is more than just a pretty face.

The pint-sized Pomeranian, from Los Angeles, is the world's fastest dog on his hind legs and the world's fastest dog on his front legs.

On top of that, he can also skateboard - taking to the streets on his customised deck – perform handstands, shake hands, bow and sign autographs.

The four-year-old pooch, who starred with Katy Perry in the music video for her award-winning single 'Dark Horse', even has his own fashion line - featuring a selection of dog collars. 

In the past year, the furry brown and white Pomeranian has become an internet sensation, gaining millions of fans on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. 

The sensational rise to fame came after, the pooch - named Jiff -  smashed the Guinness World Records for the five and 10 metre dash using only his hind and front legs, taking just 6.56 seconds on the longer course and 7.7seconds on the shorter course, according to officials.
