A vagrant Santa impersonator given an Asbo for transforming a bus stop into a Christmas grotto was found dead of a drink and drugs overdose, an inquest has heard.

Former jockey Gary Cooper was a well-known character in Penarth, South Wales, after putting up Christmas decorations inside the bus shelter, only for council workers to tear them down and ban him from the town.

After he was given an Asbo in November 2012, the 52-year-old, dubbed 'Bad Santa' moved to Cardiff but on June 6 this year he suffered a massive heart attack following an all day drink and drugs binge, and died.

Cardiff Coroner's Court heard how Mr Cooper, who called himself a 'Christmas kinda guy',  was found unconscious on the sofa at his home in the city by his girlfriend, Maria Magdalena Goodwin, 53.

She told the court: 'I came into the room and he appeared to be dead,' she told the hearing.

'I tried to wake him by pulling on his ears and slapping him but he wouldn't respond.'

Mystery: Police investigating the death could not work out how he got his hands on the prescription drug methadone because his family said he did not have a known drug problem

An ambulance was called, and Mr Cooper was rushed to hospital where he was treated for cardiac arrest.

Doctors at the University Hospital of Wales tried to resuscitate him but they were unable to save his life.

A pathologist told the inquest how the former jockey was three times the legal drink drive limit and had a fatal level of the heroin substitute methadone in his system.

 'There was a toxic level of methadone exacerbated by the presence of other central nervous system suppressants,' said Dr Richard Attanoos.

The inquest heard Mr Cooper had drank three litres of cider, a pint of white wine and two bottles of methadone.

Police investigating the death could not work out how he got his hands on the prescription drug methadone because his family said he did not  have a known drug problem.

Coroner Andrew Barkley recorded a verdict of drug related death.

During his lifetime, Mr Cooper - who was born in Runcorn, Cheshire - had appeared in court 500 times, and been admitted to hospital on 170 occasions. 

Before becoming an alcoholic he had become an apprentice jockey and served at table at London's exclusive Dorchester hotel  as a silver service waiter.

He had set up the grotto in Penarth for two years running, donning a Father Christmas outfit and spending £30 of his benefits money to deck out the bus shelter with a tree, tinsel and stocking.

However, in November 2011 council workers pulled down the decorations following complaints from people living nearby, and the following year he was slapped with an ASBO to stop him doing it again.

He branded council officials 'Scrooges' for banning him from celebrating the festive season in style, saying: 'I’m just a Christmas kind of guy. I’ve been homeless for the last few years and I just wanted it to be perfect.

'Everybody thought it was a great attraction but the council said they were going to take my stuff unless I took it down.

'I think it’s ridiculous they’ve stopped me again, I’ve got no idea why I had to take my decorations down last year.

'They obviously have no festive spirit.'

The ASBO restricted his behaviour in the run-up to Christmas in the Cardiff, Penarth and Barry areas of South Wales, and stopped him from having an open alcoholic container in any public area.
