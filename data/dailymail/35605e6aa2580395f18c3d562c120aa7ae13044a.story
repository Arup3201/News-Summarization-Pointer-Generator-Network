Russian president Vladimir Putin has been awarded the highest rank in taekwondo, giving him honorary grandmaster status.

It means the president has attained a higher ranking than former US martial artist Chuck Norris. The actor has an eight-degree black belt, while Mr Putin has a ninth-degree.

The president does not practice taekwondo, but holds a black belt in Judo and has been awarded an eighth Dan in the martial art by the International Judo Federation.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is officially tougher than actor and martial artist Chuck Norris after being awarded a ninth Dan ranking by the head of the World Taekwondo Federation while on a visit to South Korea

He was awarded the ninth Dan ranking in taekwondo by the head of the World Taekwondo Federation while on a visit to South Korea.

According to the International Business Times, Mr Putin said on receiving the honour: ‘I don't think I have earned such a high Dan.’

He added: ‘Let's call it our campaign to popularise this wonderful martial art. Russia will do its best to contribute to its popularity at home.’

His official title is now Honorary Grand Master, or Sasung, within the martial art.

He is one of only a few people to have been awarded the ‘Dan’ rank, including a number of other high-profile political characters.

On receiving the honour, Mr Putin said: 'I don't think I have earned such a high Dan.'

Earlier this year, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was awarded an honorary tenth-degree black belt - although, according to Reuters, the ninth-degree is usually the highest achievable rank.

This honour is reportedly only shared
 with two others - the International Olympic Committee's former leader 
Juan Antonio Samaranch and its current head Jacques Rogge.

Meanwhile, US president Barack Obama reportedly received an honorary black belt in taekwondo in 2009.

Mr Putin was reportedly a Judo champion in his youth and released a martial arts DVD in 2008.
