Tony Bellew’s next move after taking revenge on Nathan Cleverly will not be in pursuit of a world title but to Hollywood.

Bellew put British boxing’s bitterest of rivalries to bed with a convincing victory in front of his home fans in Liverpool. He will now turn his attention to the silver screen after landing a major role in the Rocky spin-off Creed.

The film, which will be shot in Las Vegas and Philadelphia, will chronicle the boxing career of Apollo Creed’s grandson Adonis, who will be played by Michael B. Jordan.

Sylvester Stallone will reprise his role as Rocky Balboa, trainer to Creed, and Bellew is set to play an opponent named Pretty Ricky Porter alongside unbeaten super-middleweight world champion Andre Ward.

‘I’m going to Hollywood on December 4 for an assignment,’ said a coy Bellew. ‘I’ve been sought-after for a long time. I hope it’s a speaking part because no-one wants to look at this face if I’m not talking. My life’s going to change.

‘I’ve had the contracts sitting in front of me for weeks because I wasn’t signing them. If this fight had gone wrong I wasn’t signing, I was going home to be depressed.

‘I can’t go into the details but let’s just say it’s big. It will be 40-odd days of filming, I just hope I can do it.’

Cleverly tries to protect his face after Bellew throws a punch in the direction of the Welshman 

Bellew’s boxing career might be on the back burner for now but he turned the tables on Cleverly three years after losing their first fight. The build-up to their rematch had been bitter, with both men promising an explosive finish, but it failed to spark.

‘It wasn’t a great fight because he didn’t want to fight,’ said Bellew. ‘I stood there all night and he didn’t want to know. His right hand was superglued to the side of his face.

‘It takes two to make a fight. I’ve given everything. It was so wide and so easy and I wasn’t out of second gear. I didn’t get to show what I can do at this weight, I was at 50 per cent. It was a bad performance.’

Incredibly, one judge awarded the fight to Cleverly.

‘I don’t know what Terry O’Connor was watching,’ said Bellew. ‘I’m going to put a complaint in to the board to get them to tell him to stop smoking whatever he’s smoking.

‘There shouldn’t be English judges for a domestic grudge fight because they see the whole build-up. In their heads, there’s a good guy and a bad guy and I’ve been portrayed as the bad guy.

Bellew dodges a punch from Cleverly in the early rounds of the fight at the Echo Arena

‘This was a massive fight and it’s been everywhere. They think I’m a real gobs**** and they come into the arena and expect to judge the fight from a neutral perspective.

‘He obviously made his mind up who was winning before he sat down.

‘You can’t have him winning that fight. When I heard “split decision” I thought, here we go again, my mouth’s run away with itself again.’

Cleverly’s future, meanwhile, is less certain after his second defeat in his last four fights. The Welshman revealed he hurt his right hand and that he struggled to hold Bellew off in the later stages.

‘I caught Tony on the head and I abandoned my right from the third round but I don’t want to use that as an excuse.

Cleverly struggled to cope with Bellew throughout the cruiserweight showdown

‘I’m 25lb heavier at cruiserweight and it’s difficult to carry that for 12 rounds. I slowed in the second half of the fight and Tony used his natural weight advantage.

‘I’m not a true cruiserweight, I’m caught in between weights. Going back down to light- heavyweight is an option.’

Cleverly was keen to hype the possibility of a third fight but in reality this was an attritional bout which was slow to catch fire, and these protagonists may struggle to engage the interest of the public for a decisive third meeting.

Cleverly said: ‘A split decision shows how much character I’ve got. Maybe we will have a third fight one day — I’ve been to Liverpool twice so maybe next time it could be in the Millennium Stadium in Wales.’
