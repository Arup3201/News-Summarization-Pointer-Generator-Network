It has been blighted by controversy in recent years but the Grand National triumphed yesterday – thanks to a triple whammy of a surprise winner, blazing sunshine and no fatalities.

Sue Smith, the wife of flamboyant showjumping champion Harvey Smith, had the most to celebrate after she became only the third female trainer in history to win Britain’s most popular race.

Her horse Auroras Encore was piloted home by Ryan Mania at odds of 66-1, winning in front of a 70,000 sell-out crowd by nine lengths and a nose ahead of Cappa Bleu in second place and Teaforthree in third.

She was absent from Ladies’ Day for the first time in ten years, but Coleen Rooney was not going to miss the big race yesterday – despite being heavily pregnant.

The wife of Manchester United star Wayne arrived at Aintree for the Grand National in a black maternity dress with lace detail and a pair of precarious red high heels.

While Wayne was preparing for a clash with rivals Manchester City tomorrow, Coleen watched the race with three-year-old son Kai.

Also dressed in black was singer Katherine Jenkins, who took to the track to perform the National Anthem. The theme of figure-hugging black numbers was continued by The Only Way Is Essex stars Cara Kilbey and Billi Mucklow and ex-Brookside actress Claire Sweeney.

Other racegoers, however, preferred more flamboyant outfits, including a trio of Union Jack-clad singers. Nearly all racegoers made an effort for the glamorous day, with girls donning elaborate hats, colourful dresses and towering heels.

A delighted Mrs Smith said: ‘Its 
unbelievable, Ryan gave him such a good ride. I knew the ground was 
right for him and hoped everything else was. He stayed down the middle 
and had a bit of luck in running. He didn’t have a lot of weight and 
that helped, too. He’s such a grand little horse.’

Harvey Smith, 74, who famously gave a 
V-sign to judges in the 1971 British Show Jumping Derby, last night said
 he had been dreaming of the triumph for 65 years.

He said: ‘It’s the best of my life. 
It’s the best because this is the present. Let’s hope there is more to 
come. I’m going to enjoy this because I won’t have many more moments 
like it. I’ll be 6ft under in a box soon.

‘When I was a boy I fell off my bike 
and broke my wrist – and they gave me gas when they operated to fix it. 
In those days they used to put a bowl next to you to be sick in.

‘But I put that bowl on my head and I 
was cheering. “What are you doing?” they asked me. I told them: “I’ve 
just won the Grand National.” It’s taken me 65 years to do it.’

The former show-jumper also blasted 
critics of the race. He said: ‘The doubters were rubbish. There are too 
many wimps in this country. It’s onwards and upwards for the Grand 
National.’

Smith declined to do a repeat of his V-sign sign and said: ‘No. That V-sign stuff is all in the past.’

The family’s triumph was an even greater surprise because it was the first time jockey Mania, 24, had taken part.

He said: ‘There are no words to 
describe it. I couldn’t believe my luck. I couldn’t fault the horse. He 
loved every second of it – he was class.’

The rank outsider’s victory gave 
Britain’s bookmakers, who had been taking an average of 9,000 online and
 mobile phone bets per minute, their best Grand National result in 
living memory.

David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 
‘The winner seemed to slip off every radar. We thought Mon Mome’s 
victory at 100-1 a few years ago was superb but this was every bit as 
good.’ It is believed punters staked more than £150 million on the race.

Residents in Bingley, West Yorkshire, 
where the horse is stabled, were also delighted with the result. Rev 
Beverley Mason, the vicar at All Saints Parish Church, said: ‘This is 
fantastic news for Bingley and we rejoice for the owner. Bingley is a 
fantastic town, and I hope this puts Bingley on the map. I didn’t bet on
 the race, but I wish I had done.’

At the Ferrands Arms pub in the town, half of the 30 punters who watched on TV had put money on the Aurora Encore.

Bar supervisor Elliott Andrews, 27, 
said: ‘We are expecting some celebrations tonight, and we might even put
 a picture of the horse in the pub if we can find one.’ Animal rights 
campaigners expressed relief that the event had not produced any of the 
injuries or fatalities of recent years.

The RSPCA’s David Muir said: ‘It is great news that we have seen this race finish without serious injury or death.

‘But there were horses which did not finish the race, showing that the field is still too large at 40.’
