Tara Moore managed to produce one of those eternally frustrating  British performances that promise much and yet inevitably seem to result in  crushing defeat. It’s the hope that gets you, every time, whatever sport it happens to be.

The 21-year-old’s blistering forehand helped her fight back to level the match at one set all against 2010 Wimbledon finalist Vera Zvonareva overnight and she gained an early break of serve in the third when play resumed on Court No 2 yesterday.

But, serving for a place in the second round at 5-4, an all-too familiar case of nerves overtook the British No 5. She slipped to 0-40, had a let-off when Zvonareva missed a forehand and then saved another break point, only to double fault and gift the game to her Russian opponent.

Deflated: Britain's Tara Moore lost in the first round of Wimbledon, despite serving for the match at one stage

Experience: Russia's Vera Zvonareva was just too much to handle for her opponent in the end

Moore insisted Zvonareva, a former 
world No 2 who has slipped to 566 in the rankings after two years dogged
 by injury, did not ‘give her anything’ but, although the British player
 managed to hold two further service games before losing 9-7 in the 
third set, the collective chorus of groans around Court No 2 told the 
real story.

After fighting 
so hard for two hours and 45 minutes over two days, the Briton had 
choked when it mattered most against an  opponent whose pedigree 
certainly outshone her performance.

Both players had needed wildcards to make the main draw, but only one seized her opportunity with both hands.

Moore,
 however, had only praise for Zvonareva, who will meet Donna Vekic of 
Croatia in the second round. ‘She played good on the big points,’ said 
Moore.

‘She didn’t give me 
anything. She made me work for everything. I think I did the same for 
her. She had to try very hard to beat me. She was No 2 in the world and I
 pushed her to her limits.

‘I was nervous out there obviously playing on a really big court and I am just very grateful to play on such a good court.

‘I hope that I’ve really showed them that I wanted to be there and I tried my hardest.’

Fist pump: Moore did manage to raise money for charity by producing this celebration on Wednesday

Perhaps
 it was little wonder Moore was so upbeat after a day in which she 
earned £31,500 for losing in the first round of the singles and then in 
the ladies’ doubles with partner Johanna Konta.

To
 her credit, however, her  industry and bubbly personality also saw her 
raise £3,921 for the Rally for Bally, a charity in memory of Elena 
Baltacha who died last month aged only 30.

A mobile telephone company 
donated £3 each time Moore pumped her fist and then added a further 
£3,000 after she managed 307 such celebrations during her two matches on Wednesday.
