A bag that sounds an alarm if thieves try to tamper with it has been created to solve the age-old problem of where to keep your valuables while at the beach.

Lynn and Martin Mulholland, from West Yorkshire, came up with the idea for Clam Bag when their belongings were stolen during a holiday to Spain.

The special hold-all has been created with a cord running through the zip which can be attached to a deckchair, sun lounger or seaside umbrella.

Safety first: The locked bag is secured around a beach chair with a wire - and sounds an alarm if it's touched

The only way the zip and cord can be untied is by tapping in a personalised combination code, similar to that found on a padlock or briefcase.

The bag also has a high-tech alarm system so that if someone attempts to move it from where it is left, a piercing alarm will ring out and alert the owner to the thief.

The clever device is perfect for gadgets like smartphones and tablets and essentials like money and keys.

It comes in grey or black leather and has dimensions of six inches by nine by four.

The couple are now looking to raise £19,000 on Kickstarter to get the project off the ground.

Housewife Lynn, 40, said: ‘My husband and I were on holiday in Spain and we were having lunch when someone took my bag without me realising.

‘It had our passports, money, and credit cards inside and it was an absolute nightmare.

‘When someone steals something from you it's awful, even if it's just 20 or 30 euros, you can't relax and worry it will happen again.

‘Because it was such an ordeal, before we went on our next holiday the year later, my husband built a special bag that we could use to keep our things safe.

‘We went to Crete with no problems and people were even asking us where we bought it from.

‘You simply pop everything into the bag, zip it up, and attach it to something using the wire that comes through the zip.

‘If someone tries to pick it up they can't, and there is also the option to set an alarm so it is lifted, moved, or altered a sound will ring out.

‘It gives people the option to do things together like swimming or getting ice cream without someone having to watch the bags.

‘Setting the alarm is optional and it can be turned off by a micro switch underneath the bag.’
