British Ebola victim William Pooley spoke of the pleasure he took in treating patients just days before he contracted the deadly disease.

In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Pooley said: 'It's great seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state.

'Seeing them recover and walk out the door, it's great'.'

Dressed in blue medical scrubs, Mr Pooley looked relaxed and happy as he was filmed speaking outside of a treatment centre in Sierra Leone.

contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in Sierra Leone

Dr Oliver Johnson, from London, was already in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, before the Ebola crisis  began. He and his team were working to build and strengthen the health system in the country's capital. Today he described the horror the disease has caused

Earlier today his family thanked doctors fighting to save his life for the 'excellent care' he is being given.

In
 their first statement since the 29-year-old volunteer nurse arrived 
back in the UK for emergency treatment, his family paid tribute to those
 who orchestrated his quick return.

They said: 'We would like to express our thanks to all involved in bringing our son back to the UK.

'We have been astounded by the speed and way which the various international and UK government agencies have worked together to get Will home.

'He is receiving excellent care at the Royal Free Hospital and we could not ask for him to be in a better place.

'We would like to thank all our family and friends for their best wishes and ask everyone to remember those in other parts of the world suffering with Ebola who do not have access to the same healthcare facilities as Will.'

Mr Pooley, who contracted deadly Ebola in
 Sierra Leone, is being treated at a specialist isolation ward at the 
Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London.

Dr Oliver Johnson, who has been treating patients in the county's capital Freetown, said his friend Mr Pooley was an 'extraordinary guy' who knew the risks involved, but was prepared to take them for the sake of the patients and his colleagues.

He said: 'He and I spoke about the risk together and I think he absolutely understood that there were risks involved.

'He also knew, though, that he was well trained and there were good precautions in place, so it was a measured risk.

'But where he was in Kenema a number of staff had become sick.

'He was a hugely professional nurse and a hugely dedicated one, so he understood those (risks) but was prepared to take them for the sake of the patients and colleagues he had there.'

Dr Johnson 
told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: 'I knew Will before he first came out 
to Sierra Leone, we discussed his plans for coming out.

'When the Ebola outbreak really hit, he moved up to Kenema, right to the epicentre of the outbreak to try and help.

'So he and I, my team and him, were in regular contact sharing experiences and when he came to Freetown we would share a beer.'

He added: 'Will’s a pretty extraordinary guy. Even for those of us working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, he stood out as being particularly brave and really from the beginning he was determined to help in any way he could, not just help patients but I think he had enormous loyalty towards the other staff at Kenema.'

Yesterday it emerged that Mr Pooley will be kept behind plastic sheeting for weeks, if not months, to stop the spread of ebola.

The 29-year-old nurse was put into an air transit isolator, a clear 
plastic sack, to stop the virus escaping into the RAF C-17 transport 
plane that flew him home from Freetown.

William Pooley told of Sierra Leone’s poverty and his brushes with the country’s political elite shortly before he was struck down by the potentially deadly virus.

In a moving email printed in the local village newsletter, he described in vivid detail his first impressions of the west African country which he had travelled to for a six-month volunteering stint at a hospice in the capital Freetown.

The nurse, from Eyke, Suffolk, was helping to treat locals suffering from Aids, a disease which, according to the UN, 57,000 people live with and remains a lasting legacy of the country’s decade-long bloody civil war.

At one village meeting Mr Pooley was confronted with armed guards, singled out by dancing 'devils' because of his white skin and sampled the hospitality of the well-heeled locals made rich from the country’s controversial diamond mining industry.

In an email printed in Inside Eyke, he said: 'After pushing through a crowd outside the house we were ushered inside by police with AK47s.

'The host, rich and influential thanks to diamonds, had his house boys serve us cans of ice-cold, European lager.

'The deputy leader of the APC (All People’s Congress) was there, apparently the second most powerful politician in the country.'

He told how he was treated to a show from the 'devils' - locals in an assortment of costumes, their faces painted or covered with wooden masks.

He said: 'The devils danced wildly to drums and gourd shakers and drew quite a crowd....As the only white face in the crowd, the devils singled me out for harassment.

'In order to escape from under their hay and frock skirts I had to give them small change. It was all in good humour.”

But it was not all colourful entertainment and Mr Pooley also revealed the poverty and poor sanitation which blight so many lives there.

He said: 'The houses are all mud-sand and palm thatch, the water is from one communal well and, of course, there is no electricity.'

The account was printed by his mother Jackie Pooley, who said her son had been touched by the tales of 'horror' of those caught up in the country’s civil war, which ended in 2002.

In a testament to her son’s dedication, she wrote: 'Above all, though, he finds the people there friendly, funny and hospitable, and is settling into his work, which is to provide home-based palliative care, generally for cancer and Aids sufferers, a facility which would be absent were it not for the hospice.'

On board was a team of British specialists who conducted a full clinical examination before confirming he was safe to fly.

Foreign
 Secretary Philip Hammond gave the final approval for the repatriation 
before the transporter took off at 1.50pm UK time. Ebola is an extremely
 infectious virus, spreading from person to person as a result of direct
 contact with skin or bodily fluids such as blood or sweat.

The plastic sheeting that will shroud Mr 
Pooley's body for weeks will protect health workers and other patients 
from catching the disease.

Throughout the flight the doctors were covered in head-to-toe protective suits – the same uniform will be worn by everyone Mr Pooley sees over the coming weeks.

On landing at RAF Northolt last night the volunteer nurse – still inside his plastic bubble – was loaded into an ambulance and driven to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London.

There, he was admitted through a specially-assigned hospital entrance, before being taken to the hospital's high-level isolation unit – the only ward in the UK equipped to cope with ebola.

He will occupy a £25,000 bed that will be burned after he leaves the hospital. The bed will sit inside an isolation tent.

Only seven doctors and a handful of nurses will be allowed to enter the room. Mr Pooley's treatment will focus on replacing the fluid he loses through internal bleeding.

An intravenous drip will pump saline solution into his body to try to stop his organs failing. The doctors will also treat the bleeding from his nose, eyes and ears.

If they cannot get hold of the experimental ebola drug ZMapp, the doctors will simply try to manage the disease until Mr Pooley's immune system is strong enough to fight it off.

A filtration system will suck the air away, removing all contaminated vapour before it is pumped out of the building.

The air will also be kept under negative pressure to stop any escaping from the tent. Human waste will be collected in a secure container similar to a pressure cooker before it is decontaminated and disposed of.

Stephen Mepham, one of the senior doctors at the unit, said earlier this month: 'The reason behind the unit is to protect healthcare workers from highly contagious infections such as ebola.

'Everything is contained within the tent under negative pressure so the air is constantly added and removed.

'Outside the tent, the air flows through a series of filters and is deposited outside the hospital.'
