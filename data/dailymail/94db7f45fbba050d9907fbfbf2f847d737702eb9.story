He has been lauded as one of the world's greatest ever footballers, winning Fifa's coveted Player of the Year award for a record fourth consecutive year.

But it seems Lionel Messi is no match for this Japanese goalkeeping robot.

Despite rattling in 57 goals this season, the Barcelona striker lost his famous touch when faced with the moving piece of cardboard for a Japanese game show.

Messi attempt: Despite rattling in 57 goals this season, the Barcelona striker is no match for this Japanese goalkeeping robot, which saves both of his first goal efforts

Footage of the game show shows Messi, considered by many as the game's greatest 
ever player, missing his first two spot-kicks against his 
electronic nemesis.

The Argentine striker appears to take the first defeat in good nature, smiling and shaking his head as his attempt to bury the ball in the bottom right hand corner is thwarted by the grinning cutout.

A second shot at the top left hand is also deflected as a production team can be heard jeering at the smiling player.

Finally, it seems the 25-year-old gets the measure of the machine, as a third effort - again at the top left hand corner - reaches the back of the net.

He eventually takes three penalties against the robot in the clip which has become a hit on video sharing site YouTube.
