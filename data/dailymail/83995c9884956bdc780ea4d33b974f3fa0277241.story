Tottenham and Aston Villa have been charged by the FA for failing to ‘ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion’ during their league match on Sunday. 

The clubs have until 6pm on Monday to respond. 

Referee Neil Swarbrick sent off Villa striker Christian Benteke following a 66th-minute melee in which he pushed Ryan Mason in the face after Mason and Erik Lamela had confronted him.

The one thing a referee must have is credibility – the confidence of the players to do his job. Neil Swarbrick clearly did not have that at Villa Park.

This was not a derby or a game with history. Nor was it a game between two physical teams and that was probably why Swarbrick was appointed.

To be fair the players didn't make the game easy for the match officials by pressurising them to caution and dismiss fellow professionals. However, there were only 23 free kicks awarded and they resulted in six yellow and a straight red card. Not enough control from the referee and perhaps too much advantage.

Spurs eventually won as goals from Nacer Chadli and Harry Kane in the last 10 minutes earned them a 2-1 victory over their 10-man hosts. 

Meanwhile, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has defended his first four months in charge following criticism of the club’s mediocre start to the season. 

Speaking ahead of tonight’s Europa League Group C match at Asteras Tripolis, Pochettino, who confirmed Emmanuel Adebayor has not travelled to Greece, insisted he can take the flak. 

‘Everyone in the world is criticised, it’s a difficult thing to make everyone happy,’ he said. 

‘It’s true that we need to get results, but we have a clear philosophy. 

'Sometimes difficult moments happen but this is football.’ 

In another incident, Ashley Westwood  argues with Swarbrick, urging him to send off Jan Vertonghen
