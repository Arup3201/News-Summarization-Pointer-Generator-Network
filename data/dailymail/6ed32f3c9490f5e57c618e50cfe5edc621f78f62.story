The victim has been named locally in Kingston as 28-year-old electrical engineer Colin Bolton, although formal identification is yet to take place

A man bled to death on the street in front of a horrified crowd outside a flat where he is believed to have been stabbed, it has been claimed.

It is believed a fight had broken out at the flat, where is said to have been visiting his girlfriend.

A 44 year old man has today been arrested - 70 miles away in Portsmouth.

The victim has been named locally in Kingston as 28-year-old electrical engineer Colin Bolton.

Metropolitan Police said they were still awaiting formal identification of the victim.

It is claimed he bled to death on the pavement outside an address in Kingsnympton Park, Kingston, as a group of neighbours watched in horror.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said they had arrested a 44-year-old man on suspicion of murder 70 miles away in Portsmouth, Hampshire.

The arrested man was also injured and taken to South London Hospital for treatment where he remains in police custody.

A post mortem examination is due to take place today at Kingston mortuary.

The victim's relatives had been informed of his death but a formal identification has yet to take place, said the spokesman.

Scenes of crime officers, dressed in forensic boiler suits, were continuing to examine the flat and surrounding area where he died.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said the Homicide and Serious Crime Command had been informed of the death and had launched a murder investigation.

'Police were called at around 6.20pm to reports of a man stabbed at an address in Kingsnympton Park, Kingston-upon-Thames,' said the spokesman.

'Officers, the ambulance service and London's Air Ambulance attended the scene but the man, aged 28, was pronounced dead at the scene

'A 44-year-old man was arrested this  morning in Portsmouth on suspicion of murder.

'He remains in custody at a south London hospital.'

Paramedics from an air ambulance pulled him from the property and worked on the man’s body in front of stunned families but had to give up the fight to save his life after failing to stem the horrific blood loss.

Forensic officers then cordoned off the scene and started combing for clues after the murder on Monday night.

'I saw the medics working on him. The blood was just pumping out of him,' said Stephen Beard, aged 49 years, a neighbour at the Kingsnympton Park estate said.

'There were loads of people around just watching, including children, but the police didn’t move us away.

'It was pretty bad. It went on for ages and there were kids running around.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
