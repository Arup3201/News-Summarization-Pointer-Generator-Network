A young mother who was close to becoming anorexic when her weight fell to just six stone fought back by becoming a bodybuilder.

Rachel Hobbs, 23, fell to just 84 pounds before she unexpectedly fell pregnant five years ago but said the birth of her son changed her life for the better.

The mother, of Guildford, Surrey, who is now a model, started training after having Finnley, now four, to raise her body confidence and promote positive self-image.

Her weight fell to six stone when she was 16 because of 'stress and worry' because her twin sister Nicola was suffering from anorexia.

Rachel, a Surrey University graduate, now follows a strict training regime and competed in the bodybuilding Miami Pro World Championships in St Albans, Hertfordshire, for the first time this year.

The single mother was initially planning on entering one event but she has gone on to compete in three more contests and has qualified for the UK Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation National Championships in October.

She has now put on more than two stone.

Rachel said: 'I saw ladies up on stage at Body Power Expo last year and it made me want the confidence in my body to get up there and do it.

'This is definitely the happiest I have ever been with my body. I loved being pregnant but how my physique is now is the first time I can ever say I am really confident with how I look.'

6am: 50g oats, 6 egg whites, 100g raspberries

10am: 120g chicken, 100g sweet potato, broccoli, green beans

1pm: 140g white fish, 100g sweet potato, broccoli, green beans

4pm: (1 hour pre-workout) 50g oats, 25g whey protein

5pm: (Post workout) 25g whey protein, 25g vitargo recovery supplement

8.30pm: 100g salmon, 30g almonds, asparagus

11pm: 25g protein, 10g 90 per cent dark chocolate, 150g soya yogurt

Alongside her studies, the youngster runs her own nutrition consultancy and online health company aimed at educating and supporting people to live healthier.

She said: 'I dropped to six stone when my twin sister Nicola was suffering with anorexia nervosa and I had moved out of the family home.

'It was an accumulation of stress and worry about her. I was not coping at 16. Weight has never been an issue for me but I was not very healthy.

'It was a massive shock to fall pregnant which is why I did not find out until late in the pregnancy.

'But it was the best thing ever. Finnley motivates me, puts a smile on my face and keeps me determined every day. I want to inspire him and be his role-model.'

Rachel is constantly fighting against critics who say that bikini fitness contests are no place for a young mother.

She said: 'I want to carry on. I got a mixed response when I first told my family and friends. Many people are ignorant when you tell them about it.

'They do not understand it as when you say bodybuilder they automatically think of someone who is very muscular using banned substances. I want to abolish that stigma as competitors are extremely healthy and dedicated to their sport.'
