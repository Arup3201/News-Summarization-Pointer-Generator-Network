France will ‘bring down’ the euro if it does not get to grips with austerity, one of Europe’s most influential economists has warned.

Hans-Werner Sinn, the president of Germany’s Institute for Economic Research think tank, said the single currency bloc was heading for ‘decades of crisis’.

He warned that France will ‘threaten the stability of the eurosystem’ if it does not cut Government spending and promote private business growth.

In a stinging criticism of the socialist regime run by President Hollande, he said: ‘French industry has been dying for decades now.

‘The people who were set free from manufacturing, or their children, have by and large been absorbed by the government sector, which has now a quarter of the workforce, twice that of Germany.

‘Hiding the unemployed in government offices is not a healthy solution.’

He added: ‘It is as if you are sick, and need surgery but only take drugs to numb the pain.’

His comments come only days after the boss of John Lewis said that France was ‘finished’.

The economist  warned that France will ‘threaten the stability of the eurosystem’ if it does not cut Government spending and promote private business growth.

Andy Street described the French nation as ‘sclerotic, hopeless and downbeat,’ adding: ‘I have never been to a country more ill at ease… nothing works and worse, nobody cares about it.’

In a London speech he was later forced to apologise for, he also described Paris’ flagship train station Gare du Nord as the ‘squalor pit of Europe’.

He later said he ‘went too far’ in his criticism of the nation.

While Britain’s economy has been booming, France’s has ground to a halt.

France has been described as the ‘sick man of Europe’ because of its bloated public sector and refusal to cut spending.

Mr Hollande, whose approval ratings are now lower than those of any previous French President, has been forced to dissolve his government twice in the last year over disagreements about how to fix the economic malaise.

After falling into a double dip recession, the French economy has notched up two quarters of zero growth.
