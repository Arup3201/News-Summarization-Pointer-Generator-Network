A 31-year old woman who was rushed to hospital with heart problems revealed to doctors that she had only drank soda since she was a teenager.

The woman, from Monaco, a principality near France, was brought to see a doctor after she fainted. After tests, it was discovered that she had long QT syndrome - a condition which causes an irregular heartbeat.

The patient, who has not been identified, had no family history of heart conditions - but admitted that she had not drank water since the age of 15, only two liters of cola each day.

She had dangerously low potassium levels in her body. The nutrient plays a role in regulating the human heartbeat.

After giving up soda for one week, the woman's potassium levels and heartbeat were found to have returned to normal levels, according a report of her case published this week.

Research into the link between heart problems and excessively drinking soda has been conducted and found similar cases.

More than two-thirds of Americans drink soda on a daily basis, amounting to 10.4billion gallons each year.

However in doing so, they put themselves at greater risk of developing health problems.

Soft drinks have been linked to Type-2 diabetes, obesity and a decrease in bone density which puts people at risk of osteoporosis and fractures later in life.

Dental health is also under threat from frequently downing fizzy drinks.

The sugar and acids in soda weaken enamel on teeth and make cavities more likely.

In February, a coroner ruled that a 30-year-old mother of eight from New Zealand died of a heart attack caused by her soda consumption. 

Natasha Harris reportedly drank up to 2.6 gallons of Coca-Cola each day, according to MSN.

A 42-year-old mother in the UK reportedly suffers severe headaches if she does not have at least one can of cola an hour, The Sun reported.

At times, Jakki Ballan, from Cheshire, has drank 16 liters a day, costing her around $4,600 annually. 

Dr Naima Zarqane, of Princess Grace Hospital Centre in Monaco, told the Huffington Post: 'One
of the take-home messages is that cardiologists need to be aware of the
connection between cola consumption and potassium loss, and should ask 
patients found to have QT prolongation about beverage habits.'
