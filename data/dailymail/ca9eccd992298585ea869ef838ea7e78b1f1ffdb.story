Fancy living in Margaret Thatcher Way? How about Iron Lady Road?

That's the question being asked of residents in the former Prime Minister's former constituency - and so far the answer has been a resounding 'no'.

After she died in April last year, Conservatives in Barnet, north London, asked for volunteers in Finchley, her constituency for 30 years, to rename   their street for the Grantham-born political titan.

However, a year on and Barnet Council has received no applications for a name change.

Council leader Richard Cornelius backed the idea of commemorating the nation's first female leader, but now admits a road in one of the borough's new   developments could now be named after Thatcher as an alternative.

He told the Hendon and Finchley Press: 'It will come. We will find somewhere, but it may have to be on one of the new developments.

'We are just waiting for an opportunity or a sensible suggestion.

'It may well be that a road would like to volunteer to be renamed Thatcher Way.

'There must be a road full of Tories. We are looking for one to come forward.'

Lady Thatcher became MP for Finchley in 1959 and was Conservative prime minister between 1979 and 1990

For now, Finchley and Golders Green MP Mike Freer has launched the Margaret Thatcher Tribute Fund to provide gardens for patients at North London   Hospice in Finchley.

He said: 'She was a great supporter of the hospice movement going right back to when she was MP for Finchley.'
