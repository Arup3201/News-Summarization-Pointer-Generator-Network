If they are given a second thought at all, it is not for their architecture or beauty but usually how quickly can we get out of them.

Enig Hui, a petroleum engineer from Miri, Malaysia, takes a different view.

For the last six years he has photographed stations all around the world from Euston to Hotel De Ville station in Paris and Kintetsu Nara Station in Japan.

Viennese fancy: Praterstern station, Vienna is used by 35,000 people daily. The first station on the site opened on January 6, 1838. It was damaged by bombs in the Second World War and was demolished in 1965. The new building was opened on June 1, 1959

Ueno-okachimachi Station on the subway in Tokyo, Japan opened in December 2000

Did the designer of Malostranska station in Prague take inspiration from Dr Who's Tardis? Opened on August 12, 1978 it has only one entrance/exit because of its proximity to the Vitava River

Staromestska station is situated in Prague's old town. Indeed its name means old town. It was opened 36 years ago in 1978

‘I put this project together because I would like the audience to see their daily commuting underground hubs from a different perspective,’ he says.

‘Personally, the environment truly intrigues me, and through my pictures I want to evoke a sense of drama in the extreme symmetry and contrast that the underground architecture possesses.

‘A couple of times, entering the underground made me feel like I was stepping onto a film set.’

You've seen the entrance to Ueno station in Tokyo - now admire the tracks.

Kintetsu Nara Station, Japan was opened in 1914 and has had its present name since 1970. The station consists of four platforms with four tracks

London City Airport station on the Docklands Light Railway which serves London City Airport. It opened on December 2, 2005 and is located on the King George V branch

It was last month when he realised he had amassed a considerable collection of underground images and decided to showcase the series.

The engineer has visited around 50 stations around the world including locations such as England, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Czech Republic and Italy.

He says: ‘It's not difficult to capture the stations and believe it or not I never plan ahead for any underground trip.

‘The images were all taken spontaneously during my stay in the cities, while exploring the tourist spots.

‘I've had mixed reviews from the public, ranging from eerily empty, creepy or artistically beautiful. 

‘There are still many cities I would love to visit and capture the underground stations – New York, Stockholm, Budapest, Kiev and Lisbon are all on my list.’

Mind the gap: Bank Station on the London Underground opened in 1884. In a 2013 poll conducted by YouGov, Bank was voted as London's 'Most Disliked' tube station

Euston station in north London  is the sixth busiest railway station in the UK. It was the first inter-city railway station in London, opened on July 20, 1837 as the terminus of the London and Birmingham Railway

Getting a leg up: Wien Westbahnhof railway station is the second largest station in Vienna. It was opened more than 150 years ago in 1858

Hotel De Ville station, Paris.It is one of the eight original stations opened as part of the first stage of the line between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot on July 19, 1900

Enig Hui has his camera with him wherever he goes snapping train stations

He has spent the last six years adding to his collection

Admits that some people find his photographs of stations 'creepy' while other proclaim them 'beautiful'
