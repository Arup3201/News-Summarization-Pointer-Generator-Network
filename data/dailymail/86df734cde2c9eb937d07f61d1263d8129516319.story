More police officers have died from Ground Zero illness contracted during the rescue and recovery operations at the World Trade Center than were killed in the September 11 terrorist attacks, officials have revealed.

The shocking news shows that the death toll from the destruction of the Twin Towers continues to rise - more than 12 years after the fact.

The names of 20 more officers were added to a granite memorial for first responders in Albany, New York, on Tuesday, bringing the total death toll to 71.

Rising death toll: Sixty police officers were killed in the 9/11 attacks - 71 have no died from Ground Zero illnesses they contracted from working in the debris of the World Trade Center

Six died last year, four in 2012, and three before that.

According to authorities, the 13 of the 20 new causalities died from 
cancers attributed to rescue and recovery work at the collapsed World 
Trade Center towers in Manhattan.

By contrast, 60 police officers were killed on September 11, 2001 after they rushed into the World Trade Center before it collapsed.

Ground Zero illness is a catch-all term used to describe the cancers, respiratory problems and other diseases that researchers say effect thousands of people who worked at Ground Zero in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.

The dust and debris from the wreckage of the World Trade Center has been described as 'wildly toxic.

Workers at Ground Zero breathed in a mixture of pulverized glass, cellulose, asbestos, lead and mercury - combined with dioxins and other contaminants from the smoke of the burning wreckage.

The result, say suffers and several public health experts, is a higher rate of cancer and a slew of other diseases in the people who were exposed to Ground Zero in the months after the attacks.

The government slowly began to recognize Ground Zero illness after the 2006 death of 34-year-old NYPD Detective James Zadroga.

In 2011, President Barack Obama signed a law - the James Zadroga Act - that created a $4.2billion program to provide health care to Ground Zero illness sufferers.

'I live 
near the World Trade Center. I inhaled the toxic smoke that permeated 
every square inch of lower Manhattan,' New York State Assembly Speaker 
Sheldon Silver said.

'I
 know how nobly and heroically the NYPD carried out their duties on that
 tragic September day and the terrible days that followed.'

Silver addressed hundreds of police, relatives and officials who gathered for the annual remembrance ceremony Tuesday at the memorial located in the Empire State Plaza in downtown Albany to honor officers who died from duty-related causes.

He acknowledged it was small condolence for surviving families that the experience of what their loved ones endured will prevent a similar fate for other first responders.

After the ceremony, several declined to talk, saying both the ceremony and what theyâ€™d experienced were difficult.

For those who died later as a consequence of the trade center attacks, it has also meant several years of disabling injuries and illness, Lieutenant Governor Robert Duffy said. More than half of the 1,360 names on the wall were members of the NYPD, he said.

Also added this year were the names of four state troopers, a Buffalo officer who died last year from a gunshot wound she received responding to a 911 call from a convenience store in 2006, a Yates County deputy killed in 1957 and a state conservation game protector killed in 1914.
