A British trawler captain has been fined 
£22,000 and banned from fishing for a year after being found guilty in a French court of 
switching-off his ship's locater beacon and illegally poaching scallops off the Normandy coast.

Andrew Nicholson, 51, from Dumfries in Scotland was stopped by the French Navy in 
September and ordered to return 14 tons of 
scallops to the sea which he had collected from the Bay of the Seine
 near Le Havre.

His dredger Mattanja, which is owned by 
TN trawlers based in Annan,Scotland, was
 escorted to Ouistreham
 on the Normandy coast and a judge ordered the owners to pay a massive 
£120,000 bail before it was allowed to sail out of the port.

French scallops

The court in Caen heard that an 
inspection of the Mattanja's instruments found that the transponder which records the exact positions of a
 vessel over a given period of time had been switched off.

In court the Mattanja was referred to as an 'invisible ghost vessel' on the day in question.

Nicholson was charged by the French prosecutor of poaching shellfish inside the French 12 mile limit. He was
fined £18,000 and ordered to 
pay another £4,000 to the Norman fishermens' association.

The victory in one their own courts 
yesterday has raised fear that militant fishermen on the French side of 
the Channel desperate to protect their stocks of the lucrative shellfish
 delicacy may well launch another direct attack on individual British 
trawlers fishing just outside sea limits.

In October they launched a flotilla of
 boats and terrorised the crew of a UK trawler , hurling rocks and iron 
bars at them and accusing them of poaching in their waters .

The skipper of one UK trawler called for protection by the Royal Navy after a violent clash with the French.

The Van Dijck is registered in Brixham, Devon, and owned by Englishman Andrew McLeod.

In October Mr McLeod said the Royal 
Navy should be used to protect fishermen from further attacks by the 
French.Mr McLeod said: 'Protection from the Royal Navy is something 
we've been asking for for some time.'

The Royal Navy was deployed to protect British fishermen during the Cod Wars with Iceland in  the 1970s.

In 1972, Iceland had declared an Exclusive Economic Zone beyond its own territorial waters while announcing plans to reduce over-fishing.

This led to the Icelandic Coastguard cutting the nets of British trawlers that fished in the area.

The UK retaliated by deploying Royal Navy warships to protect British fishing crews.

There followed a number of stand-offs between UK and Icelandic vessels, which included them ramming each other.

The lengthy dispute finally  ended in 1976 when Iceland threatened to close a vital Nato base in retaliation for the deployment  of the Navy.

The British Government conceded that UK vessels would no longer fish within the disputed 200- nautical-mile limit.

He
 said the British had been in negotiations with the French over access 
to the rich scallop beds 15 miles off the coast of Caen.

The Van Dijck’s crew painted Union Jack on the boat’s side, and pledged to resist efforts by the French to intimidate them.

The judge's guilty verdict on Mr Nicholson today was welcomed by the Normandy fisherman's association.

President Paul Francoise said that the
 case of the Mattanja had been a blatant case of deliberate poaching.

'He knew perfectly well that he was fishing inside the twelve mile 
territorial limit and he tried to escape notice by switching off his 
transponder', he said.

His association asked the judge to 
impose a 26 thousand euro indemnity but only four thousand euros were 
awarded as 'material loss' by the French fishing industry had not been 
proved, only 'moral prejudice'.

Mr Francoise claims that EU 
regulations which allow British trawlers to fish for scallops in larger 
quantities and for longer periods off the French coast give them an 
unfair advantage over their French counterparts.

'Even if the British stay outside the 
French limits they are still pillaging the stocks which our fishermen 
have taken pains to build up over the years and which they are forced to
 see disappearing over the Channel to UK processing factories.

'What really angers us is to see 
French scallops caught by the Brits in French waters and then taken to 
the UK to be processed and then returned to French supermarkets in 
plastic bags to be sold in France'.

Frustration: Angry French protestors have called on EU authorities to impose a temporary ban
 on fishing for scallops claiming that overfishing had reduced sizes of 
shellfish and catches

Mr Francoise admitted that part of the
 French problem is that local fishermen have failed to set up local 
factories and modernise their industry, preferring to sell scallops in 
their natural state to housewives at markets.

In the case of another UK scallop 
dredger arrested this month in the same sea area Mr Francoise said his 
association would be demanding 'much compensation as the skipper may 
well have just made a mistake' over his position due to a miscalculation
 .

The Van Dijck, which was victim of a 
violent attack by Norman trawlermen in October, was hauled into 
Ouistreham by the French Navy earlier this month after being ordered to 
return seventeen tons of scallops to the sea.

Skipper Gary Smith, 47, faces charges 
of poaching in French waters and switching off his transponder which 
together carry a maximum jail sentence of one year plus a 90 thousand 
pound fine.

He was ordered to pay a five figure 
sum as bail before being allowed to return his vessel to the UK pending a
 court case due to take place in May.

Mr Smith told investigators that 
he turned off his transponder so that a nearby Scottish trawler could 
not follow him and fish in the same spot.
