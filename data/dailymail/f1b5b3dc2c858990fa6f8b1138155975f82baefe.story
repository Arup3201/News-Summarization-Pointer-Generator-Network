Having finished his nightmare at Manchester United, Brazilian midfielder Anderson’s return home to play for Internacional has certainly not started smoothly.

Manchester United fans might not be surprised but Anderson lasted just 36 minutes of a Copa Libertadores contest against Bolivian side The Strongest on Tuesday evening, huffing and puffing his way to the touchline.

Having been substituted, the exhausted 26-year-old sat on the bench in some distress before requesting an oxygen mask from Internacional staff, although the match in La Paz was played at extremely high altitude.

Despite being Brazilian, Anderson has maybe become too accustomed to the climate in Manchester as he struggled to cope in La Paz - a place well known for causing altitude sickness as the city stands at 3,500m above sea level.

Anderson left Old Trafford earlier this month and so far the midfielder has failed to make an impact for his new employers, with Internacional eventually losing 3-1 against The Strongest on Tuesday evening.

He made his debut against Cruzeiro last week, only to miss a crucial penalty after coming on as a second-half substitute.

Anderson only featured twice for United under Louis van Gaal this season, last playing at the end of August

Anderson was seen as surplus to requirements under Louis van Gaal, making just two appearances for United this season and was a peripheral figure the season before under David Moyes, who loaned him out to Fiorentina.

He rarely lived up to his potential since moving from Porto in a deal worth £27million in 2007.

Anderson suffered a cruciate injury in 2010 and badly damaged his knee the following year. As a result he struggled for full match fitness and remained a squad player for United.

When the second injury struck he was still only 22 but he had already achieved so much. Sir Alex Ferguson and his predecessors became frustrated with the Brazilian’s motivation and his apparent taste for fast food, which led to much ridicule from fans until he departed.
