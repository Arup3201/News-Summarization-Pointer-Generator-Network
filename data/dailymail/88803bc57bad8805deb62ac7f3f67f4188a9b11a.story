Arsene Wenger has suffered a crushing setback to his summer transfer plans after Lars Bender announced he will remain at Bayer Leverkusen next season.

Sportsmail revealed last week that the Arsenal manager had identified a defensive midfielder as a transfer priority and that Leverkusen anchor man Bender was his top target. 

But after being quizzed about Arsenal’s 
interest, the 25-year old insisted he would not be heading for the 
Emirates and would, instead, be looking to build on his recent return after signing a new contract earlier this season.

Bender’s form dipped alarmingly in the midst of mounting speculation about a renewed Arsenal bid and a run of poor results that cost Sami Hyypia his job as manager.

But he capped an impressive display against Borussia Dortmund with a goal and was back in peak form in a 2-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday.

It hasn’t gone unnoticed at Arsenal, but 
Bender was quick to dismiss suggestions he could be on his way after the
 World Cup, saying: ‘I signed my new contract until 2019, and that 
should have told everyone how happy I am at Leverkusen.

'I feel settled here and see no reason
 to change anything. In fact, if I am to be completely honest, I haven’t
 had an overly brilliant season and don’t feel ready yet to take on a 
pivotal role at a big club somewhere else.

‘I need to keep working on my game, and I am going to do that here at Leverkusen. That suits me, and I am happy with that.’

As well as a defensive midfielder, Arsenal are also targeting a striker.
