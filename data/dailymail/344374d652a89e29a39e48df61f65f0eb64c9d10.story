It feels almost churlish to be labelling someone who cost £27million as an unexpected hero; for that kind of money the volume of goals Edin Dzeko has scored this season should be mandatory. 

Twenty-four in all competitions isn’t to be sniffed at, but for whatever reason it just hasn’t happened for the Bosnian at Manchester City before now.

He is a divisive character at the Etihad. Some absolutely loathe a bumbling first touch and lack of link-up; others recognise that the 28-year-old is a goalscorer and a player who works harder with more intelligence than his languid style suggests. City have proved in recent weeks that if you ping balls into the box, Dzeko will be waiting to tuck in.

Marksman: Edin Dzeko has scored crucial goals at Crystal Palace and Everton recently to help guide City towards the title

And that’s exactly what he’s done in recent weeks. Nodding in Yaya Toure’s cross at Crystal Palace with the confidence of a poacher, he settled the nerves at Selhurst Park early on. He did the same at Old Trafford.

Dzeko averages a goal every 136 minutes, the sixth best in Premier League history:

Sergio Aguero.........................115

Thierry Henry...........................122

Javier Hernandez...................128

Ruud van Nistelrooy...............128

Robin van Persie....................135

Edin Dzeko..............................136

On Saturday Dzeko was unplayable at Everton. Not only did he score twice - yes, he had two bites at the cherry for his first - but the striker was a real handful for Antolin Alcaraz and John Stones.

The debate still goes on about whether he’s really up to it or not.

Immediately after the 1-1 draw against Arsenal in March, supporters threw a portion of blame at Dzeko, who was perceived to have been lazy and unproductive. On that particular day he looked lonely, an isolated targetman hoping for someone to play off.

Since, Manuel Pellegrini has urged David Silva and Samir Nasri to get closer to him away from home. The results at Palace and Everton are testament to that, while they perhaps should’ve gone away from Anfield with something.

Tamed beast: Alvaro Negredo looked a sensation in the first half of the season but his form has tailed off

The Chilean is finding a way to get the best out of Dzeko in a way in which Roberto Mancini couldn’t. He’s had to, given Sergio Aguero’s injury trouble - to have left him out for months on end - and Alvaro Negredo’s puzzling dip in form: he hasn’t scored in the Premier League since January 12.

There doesn’t appear to be a quick fix to Negredo’s problems. The former Sevilla man works hard, covers the width of the 18-yard box with more gusto than Dzeko, but simply isn’t as productive with it.

It is easier to laud Negredo. He looks to be putting more effort in, wins more in the air and is more comfortable with the intricacy of Silva and Nasri in behind. But he has lost the knack of scoring goals.

Dzeko has it, so he is given the shirt. Two at Everton, the first at Crystal Palace, two at Manchester United, the only goal at home against Palace and nudging City back ahead against Southampton last month have all been very important goals.

Tactician: Manuel Pellegini has worked out how to get the best out of Edin Dzeko

Pellegrini has it spot on. The former Wolfsburg striker isn’t the archetypal front man for a side so insistent on beauty, but has carried the can while Aguero’s been absent. Plan A is to play through teams, Plan B to go a touch more direct. Dzeko clearly suits the latter and - with a fully fit Argentine - is a threat off the bench. An expensive threat, but one nonetheless.

From the start though, and this has been the case since the move to England in 2011, his work is often unseen and underappreciated. Put politely it isn’t obvious and flashy enough to be the topic of praise down the pub after games.

That said, he can be frustratingy inconsistent. There is an argument that you ought to expect more bang for your buck.

Hotshot: Dzeko's strike-partner Sergio Aguero has had a disrupted season through injury

In a microcosm, Dzeko is both the reason why City should win the league and why they haven’t already won it with ease.

Failing Financial Fair Play is unlikely to have serious ramifications for the club - unless UEFA don’t fancy some of Europe’s top sides in the Champions League - but their spending may have to be curbed. You’d expect Dzeko to still be turning in to training from Carrington’s leafy lanes come July for that reason alone.

Interestingly, both Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger have bemoaned their striking options this season. What both wouldn’t give for someone like Dzeko. He might have won them the title.
