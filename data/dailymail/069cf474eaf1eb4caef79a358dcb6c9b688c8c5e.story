The grandson of Kim Jong-il is clearly enjoying life at college in Eastern Europe - not that any of his compatriots would ever know.

Kim Han-sol appears just like any other teenager. He enjoys experimenting with his hair, making friends with girls and even has a fondness for romantic comedies.

We know this because, the grandson of North Korea's Dear Leader has joined Facebook.

So while the oppressed regime he left is denied even a telephone exchange - let alone the internet - he is enjoying the trappings of the world's most popular social network.

If it weren't for the fact he was estranged from Kim Jong-il, the hypocrisy would be almost unbearable.

Kim Han-sol, who attends the United 
World College in Bosnia, has even posted a picture of himself locked 
arm-in-arm with a young lady who seems to be his girlfriend.

He even captioned the photo: 'I'm going to miss you so much'.

The girl, whose identity is unknown, 
replied: 'I love you too, yeobo.' 'Yeobo' is a term of endearment that 
Korean spouses use to address each other.

Likely to be of far more interest, 
and concern, to his grandfather is a post in which the teenager asks his
fellow students if they prefer democracy or communism.

Quirky style: The teenager sports large spectacles and has an ever-changing haircut

Han-sol, whose father Kim Jong-nam was passed over for leadership, said he is a fervent believer in democracy.

Pictures show his personal style to be quirky, favouring rimmed glasses, bow ties and costume jewellery.

He also notes his favourite film as 
the Hugh Grant romantic comedy Love Actually, which is unlikely to be shown on the silver screen in Pyongyang any time soon.

Han-sol has now blocked access to his Facebook account to all but those he personally approves.

South Korean newspapers also claimed 
to have found an account on the social network that belongs to Jong-nam 
in which he insults his half-brother Kim Jong-un, his father's chosen 
successor.
