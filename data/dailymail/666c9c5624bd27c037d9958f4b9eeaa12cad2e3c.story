Nicola Sturgeon has vowed to join forces with Labour after the general election to 'lock David Cameron out of Downing Street'.

In a speech  in Glasgow tonight, she said that Scots MPs would vote to stop a Tory government 'even getting off the ground' in the event of the SNP getting a majority north of the border.

Speaking to 3,000 delegates Ms Sturgeon also put forward policies which would increase public spending, including an end to austerity, a rise in the minimum wage, and increased payouts to youngsters who stay on at school past the age of 16.

Nicola Sturgeon pledged that SNP MPs would vote to stop a Conservative government 'even getting off the ground' after the general election, and asking Labour to make the same promise

She also reiterated the SNP's longstanding pledge to scrap the Trident nuclear programme, abolish the House of Lords, and plough more money into the NHS.

In echoes of Conservative adverts showing Ed Miliband in the pocket of Alex Salmond, she also talked about the SNP 'forcing Labour's hand' and giving the Labour party 'backbone and guts'.

She said: 'Let me said it loud and let me make it clear - the SNP will never put the Tories into government. Not now. Not ever.

'As long as there are more anti-Tory MPs - Labour or SNP - than there are Tory MPs in the House of Commons, we can keep them out of government.

'If there are more anti-Tory than Tory MPs after the election, the only way the Tories get back into power is if Labour lets them back in.

'So in the interests of total clarity, let me make this promise today. If there is a hung Parliament, SNP MPs will vote to stop a Tory Government even getting off the ground.

She also said that the SNP would 'force Labour's hand' in government, giving Ed Miliband's party 'guts and backbone'

'I call on Labour, today, to match that pledge - to make clear that if Labour and the SNP combined have more seats than the Tories, they will join forces with us in a vote of confidence to lock David Cameron out of Downing Street.'

Ms Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP was 'a vote to make sure that the Tories are replaced with a better alternative.'

She told the conference: 'If you want a Labour government to have backbone and guts, you need to elect SNP MPs to provide it for them.

'And if you want a Labour government that won't just be a carbon copy of the Tories, but will instead deliver the real change Scotland needs, then you must elect SNP MPs to force Labour's hand and keep them honest.'

SNP MPs at Westminster would back a £2 rise in the minimum wage, taking it to £8.70 by 2020, the end of the next UK parliamentary term.

She also set out her goal of making Scotland a 'Living Wage nation', with a target of having 500 companies paying this to their workers in the next 12 months.

To help youngsters stay on at school and college, she announced the Educational Maintenance Allowance would be extended.

While 35,000 teenagers currently receive the payments of up to £30 a week, she said more school pupils and part time college students would be eligible for the grant.

'From next year a total of 57,000 16 to 19 year olds will be entitled to receive and Educational Maintenance Allowance,' she stated.  

She also announced a new fund of £20 million would be set up in Scotland in a bid to tackle violence against women. 

Ms Sturgeon also talked of offering 'the hand of friendship' to the rest of the UK after the bitter independence battle of last year.

She said the SNP's goal was still to make Scotland indepedent, but until that could be achieved she was eager to work with 'like-minded' parties throughout the country.

She added: 'To people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, I make this promise. The SNP stands ready to work with you in making that positive change for all of us.'

Addressing Scottish voters, she said: 'We will work every day to protect Scotland's interests and to make your voice heard.

'We will seek to use whatever influence you give us to call a halt to ever deeper austerity, to protect our NHS and to say loudly and clearly that the precious resources of our country should be invested in the future of our children, not in nuclear bombs.

'We will use our influence to win for our Scottish Parliament the full financial and social powers that it needs to grow our economy and create more jobs.

'And we will work in a spirit of friendship and co-operation with others who share our ideals - we will work with everyone, wherever they may be in the UK, who wants to see greater fairness and prosperity at the heart of their communities too.'

While her speech was met with a six-minute standing ovation in Glasgow, her critics rounded on her policies saying they would 'wreck the economic recovery', adding that she 'hadn't learned the lessons' of previous years.

Scottish Liberal Democrat party president Malcolm Bruce MP said: 'Nicola Sturgeon's £180 billion borrowing plans threaten to wreck the economic recovery across the UK.

In an effort to put the bitter campaigning of the independence referendum behind her, she said she was 'extending the hand of friendship' to the rest of the UK, while still advocating Scottish independence

'We know that the cost of interest repayments alone would be equivalent to a new secondary school every other day. They haven't learnt the lessons of the last economic crash.

'It is not liberal or progressive to leave an ever growing mountain of debt for future generations to pay. We will not spend today what our children should have tomorrow.'

Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy added: 'No-one will be fooled by Nicola Sturgeon's claims to be the UK's best friend when the SNP's entire purpose is trying to break up Britain.

'There was no mention today of the austerity max that would be inflicted on Scotland if the SNP were to follow through on their policy of full fiscal autonomy.

'The First Minister knows, but won't admit, that SNP sums don't add up and her economic plans would lead to a £7.6 billion black hole in tax revenues.'
