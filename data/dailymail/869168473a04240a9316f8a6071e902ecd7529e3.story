The friend of a New Jersey high school student who allegedly had sexual relations with his English teacher took to the witness stand this week to recount what he knew of the pair's relationship.

Jenna Leahey, 33, is facing several charges, including sexual assault and official misconduct, for a series of encounters she allegedly had with a 16-year-old male student.

The former English teacher and hockey coach at Parsippany Hills High School has pleaded not guilty and the pre-hearing on Tuesday was to decide what evidence will be admissible for trial.

The witness said the alleged victim told him that he and Leahey had touched each others genitals in her classroom, according to NJ.com.

Charged: Jenna Leahey, 33, is facing several charges including sexual assault and official misconduct for a relationship she had with a student after helping him through the death of a relative

Official misconduct: The prosecution says the former English teacher and hockey coach had a series of encounters with a student between January and June 2013

They also 'did other physical things in the classroom', he said.

'He also told me she took him home with her after a volleyball game,' the friend said.

The friend said he was told of the alleged relationship while playing video games with the alleged victim.

He said the boy 'got really quiet' when the friend guessed he was 'talking to' a teacher.

The court was told that 'talking to' in high school meant dating.

The former student said the alleged victim showed him 'sort of nude' pictures that Leahey had allegedly sent him on text.

The incidents allegedly occurred between January and June in 2013.

Parsippany Hills High football coach Dave Albano also testified.

Albano said the alleged victim and his friend came and told him about Leahey in June last year after rumors started circulating the school.

The alleged victim told Albano he and Leahey had 'kissed', 'made out' and 'were fooling around in the car' after a volleyball game when Leahey drove the boy home.

The boy said he hadn't had intercourse with Leahey, according to Albano.

The boy admitted to the coach they had exchanged 'dirty' text messages.

'He was scared and nervous,' Albano said of the boy.

A second friend of the alleged victim told the court Tuesday that he didn't believe the teen when he said he was having a relationship with Leahey.

However after teasing the boy, he gave in and showed the text messages.

'Ms. Leahey was one of the good-looking teachers in school,' the second friend said, according to The Daily Record.

'I'd say ''Oh, I saw you trying to flirt with Ms. Leahey''.

'He denied it at first and then got fed up with me teasing him about it.'

Leahey gave police a taped interview that was played Tuesday to the judge, where she admitted to sending texts to the boy but denied anything else happened.

She had the confidence to the send explicit texts, which said was 'stupid', but was never able to anything when physically with the boy.

She said the teen was abusive with her and would touch her breasts and buttocks and put his hand down her pants.

Leahey told authorities he also tried to kiss her several times.

'I never physically touched the kid ever. He is just a kid,' she said in her 2013 interview, The Daily Record reported.

'I do feel responsible I didn't draw that line (with the texts) immediately.'

Jenna Leahey has pleaded not guilty and the pre-hearing on Tuesday was to decide what evidence will be admissible for trial

Leahey's attorney is seeking to subpoena what authorities allege are explicit text messages she exchanged with the student. 

Her attorney, Stephanie Forbes, told NJ.com she plans to file a motion to dismiss the charges.

The pair's alleged relationship started after Leahey counseled the young man following his aunt's death from cancer.

After that the two began texting in a cell phone game.

The prosecution and the defense dispute what happened next.

Two more witnesses were scheduled to testify Tuesday afternoon.
