Letting churchgoers park free of charge in town centre car parks on Sundays discriminates against non-believers, a secular campaigner claims.

Keith Porteous Wood is suing a local council over the scheme, which applies to individuals of all faiths.

Mr Porteous Wood, of the National Secular Society, argues that by allowing free parking for those attending churches in Woking, Surrey, the local council is contravening the Equality Act.

Discrimination claim: Keith Porteous Wood, Executive Director of the National Secular Society says it is unfair that churchgoers get free parking permits in Woking, Surrey, while he still had to pay £3

‘The equal treatment of all, 
regardless of belief or non-belief, is a key secular principle,’ he 
said. ‘It is neither legitimate nor lawful for local government to 
subsidise the activities of any particular religion and belief group.

'It
would be fairer if the council either charged worshippers for parking 
or provided free parking for all.’

After receiving a number of 
complaints from local residents, Mr Porteous Wood drove to Woking on 
Sunday April 14 and paid £3 to park in the Heathside Crescent council 
town centre car park for more than two hours. Those at church services 
parked in the same car park for free.

Mr Porteous Wood’s ‘less favourable 
treatment’ was because of religious belief, his lawyers argue in what 
will be a test case for local authorities all over the country.

They point out that local churches have been provided with ticket validating machines or parking permits.

Woking Borough Council confirmed it had received the notice of legal action from NSS’s lawyers.

Council official Peter Bryant 
defended the free parking, saying that faith communities play an 
important role in voluntary work and promoting social inclusion.

He added: ‘The council took legal 
advice. It was advised that it amounted to indirect discrimination, but 
could be justified on the basis that it was a proportionate means of 
achieving a legitimate aim.’

The issue of free parking for worshippers has become increasingly contentious as more councils scrap free Sunday parking to pursue extra revenue.

The charges were initially denounced as a 'tax on worshippers' and a number of local authorities set up 'worship parking permit' schemes.

However, there are mixed feelings about the case in Woking. Office worker Karen Vincent, 44, said: ‘I am not a churchgoer myself but I think that it is very sad that the Secular Society feels it is necessary to take this costly action.

‘No doubt the council will incur a large legal bill defending its decision. I am sure that as well as the churches, the council helps other organisations with subsidised parking.’

But businessman Mark Robertson, 57, supports the challenge. He said: ‘If you are going to give one group of people free parking then you need to give it to them all.

‘This is completely unfair. Why should I be discriminated against because I am an atheist?’
