A grandfather has been banned from entering any Sainsbury's store in Britain - because he accidentally drove his mobility scooter into another shopper.

Albert Carter received a letter from the supermarket chain stating police would be called if he is seen in any of its 1,200-plus stores again as he would be  a 'trespasser'.

The 80-year-old had gone into a branch of Sainsbury's in Newcastle-under-Lyme to buy a packet of cigarettes on March 7.

He accidentally hit a woman with his scooter after paying and paramedics were called to the store. They took the shopper to hospital as a precaution.

Mr Carter also struck a customer service desk with his scooter as he panicked following the collision with the female shopper.

He received the letter outlining his ban less than a week later. 

The former truck driver said he has been made to feel like a 'shoplifter' following the mishap and added that it was the first accident he has been involved in on his scooter.

He said: 'I understand that they might be concerned about me coming into the shop after what happened but I have never had an accident on it before so why would they ban me forever?

'It was my fault. I take the blame completely. After I paid at the front kiosk I turned to leave and then don't know how it happened.

'I didn't do it on purpose but it was that quick I'm not sure how I hit the women. I was really upset that I hurt someone.

'The staff and paramedics were nice at the time so I don't understand why I have been sent this letter. I have never been a shoplifter so why are they treating me like one?

A letter sent by the store manager to the 80-year-old a week after the incident said that if he did enter a Sainsbury's he would be treated as a 'trespasser'

'I want to apologise to the lady. I am really upset to have hurt her.

'Even if I was let into Sainsbury's I'm not sure I would want to go in again after the way they treated me. I have barely left home since the incident.' 

The letter stated: 'The invitation to enter and shop at all Sainsbury's stores is permanently withdrawn due to the incident you were involved in.

'Should you enter any of our premises, you will be treated as a trespasser and the police will be called as necessary.'

The father-of-three's daughter Jayne Taylor, from Chesterton, Staffordshire, has hit out at the supermarket for the ban, which she claims is normally reserved for shoplifters.

The 50-year-old, who works as a security guard, said: 'Dad was so upset and distraught at what happened.

Mr Carter said: 'Even if I was let into Sainsbury's I'm not sure I would want to go in again after the way they treated me. I have barely left home since the incident'

'We are not denying that he was in the wrong but it was a complete accident, he didn't go into Sainsbury's to plough customers down.

'I'm just flabbergasted he has been treated like a criminal. It's ridiculous. How will they enforce it?

'It's just out of order. He has now lost his confidence and won't go out on the scooter.'

A Sainsbury's spokesman said: 'Our teams in store have a duty to consider the safety of all of our customers and this decision was reached after reviewing CCTV footage and other reports.

'We will, of course, be happy to discuss this further with Mr Carter and his family, to ensure that we maintain a safe shopping environment for everyone.'

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman added that the female patient was taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital in Hartshill as a precaution and had non-serious injuries.
