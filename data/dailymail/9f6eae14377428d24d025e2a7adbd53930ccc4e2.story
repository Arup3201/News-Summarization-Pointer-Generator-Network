A police officer in Texas has been placed on leave after being caught on video tripping and pushing high school students at a soccer match this weekend.

Fans of the Vandegrift High School girls soccer team stormed the field after the team won the state championship Saturday at Georgetown's Birkelback Stadium.

But a few of the happy fans hit the ground when tripped by Georgetown Police Officer George Bermudez.

Disciplined: Georgetown, Texas Police Officer 
George Bermudez has been placed on leave for tripping and pushing high 
school students at a soccer game last Saturday

Video captured of the victory shows Officer Bermudez trip one man, try to trip a high school girl and push yet another reveler.

Since the video was uploaded Sunday, the officer has been placed on leave.

Georgetown Police Chief Wayne Nero released a statement Monday afternoon calling Officer Bermudez's reaction inappropriate.

'After personally watching the videos, the actions of my officer are very concerning to me as well,' Chief Nero said.

Victory: Officer Bermudez is first seen on the video tripping a man in pink shorts as he storms the field after the Vandegrift High School girls soccer team won the state championship

You're out: He is then seen ordering the reveler off the field back towards the bleachers

Chief
 Nero added that an internal investigation will determine the correct 
discipline for the nine-year veteran who was named Officer of the Year 
in 2013. 

Vandegrift junior Audrey Ziari was one of the high-schoolers Officer Bermudez attempted to trip on Saturday.

'I just kept going and did not think about if he was going to hurt me,” Ms Ziari told KXAN. 'I just kind of lifted up my foot because I felt him coming towards me.'

Not so fast! Officer Bermudez then tries to trip a high school girl - albeit unsuccessfully

While
 the students were warned not to storm the field, Ms Ziari says she did 
it anyway since she and other students had done it before for home 
basketball games.

'It was mixed whether we can do it or we cannot do it, so everyone was like, "Oh, whatever. We are going to do it."' she said.

The
 University Interscholastic League says it has no policy against rushing
 the field, but issues warnings over the intercom to protect the games' 
attendants.
