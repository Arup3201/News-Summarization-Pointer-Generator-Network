There will be little to learn, so the theory goes. Once England have knocked over the country ranked 208th in the world by FIFA, they will then dismantle the nation who occupy 81st position.

Two more victories, most likely achieved without having to break sweat, will take England a step closer to confirming their place at Euro 2016 but with neither San Marino nor Estonia being regarded as top-class opposition, what is there for Roy Hodgson’s squad to gain in the next week?

Plenty, if you ask Adam Lallana. The Liverpool midfielder, who is just starting to find a groove after recovering from a medial ligament problem, believes the stakes are as high as they have been for him, after a year of skirting around the edges with his country.

Adam Lallana faced the press at England's base at St George's Park on Tuesday afternoon

England's 0-0 draw against Costa Rica at the World Cup was not the perfect stage for Lallana to thrill

So far, Lallana has been in 12 squads. He made his debut in a 2-0 defeat to Chile last November and the memory of a bright early impression has evaporated since he was shoved out of the starting line-up for the World Cup opener against Italy in Manaus, as Roy Hodgson went with Raheem Sterling.

In total, Lallana’s England career amounts to just 440 minutes – 29 of which were in the tedious 0-0 dead rubber with Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte – and he recognises the time has come for him to re-establish himself in Hodgson’s thinking.

Don’t tell him, then, that the next seven days are an exercise in futility.

‘Definitely,’ came Lallana’s instant response when it was suggested there was a lot at stake for him against San Marino and Estonia. 

‘It's always good, even in training, to show the manager what you can do and remind him so if I get my chance, I'll be looking to take it and impress him.

Since his summer move to Liverpool, the 26-year-old has also gained valuable Champions League experience

‘There's always going to be competition at this level. The amount of English players we have playing in the Premier League... there's no shortage really, so there'll be people pushing you for your places. I still feel I have a lot to learn and prove.

‘I don't think by any stretch I'm an established international. I have hard work to do to get to this level consistently. 

'As a footballer, you want to play every game possible. But the manager has big decisions to make. He has a squad and 11 places to choose for.

‘I have huge respect for the manager and every decision he makes. The World Cup was disappointing but because we went out. 

'Each game is different so you have to be versatile. We have different players to suit different kinds of games in our selection.’

The midfielder's performances have improved over the last fortnight, culminating in a goal against West Brom

Lallana looked to be full of confidence when he faced the media at St George’s Park yesterday, something which stems from the fact his performances have significantly improved over the last fortnight, culminating in his goal against West Brom on Saturday.

If the knee ligament injury he suffered in Boston in July could not have come at a worse possible time, he made his first appearances in a Liverpool team that was out of sorts last month and his form suffered as a consequence.

A positive display in the 1-1 draw against Everton, though, was a step in the right direction and he now feels as if he is adjusting to the pressure and scrutiny that comes with playing for Liverpool; there is no longer the possibility for him to have a ‘quiet’ game.

‘It's just something you have to learn to deal with,’ said Lallana. ‘It happens. People move for big sums of money, to a team that will always be challenging for silverware, and that comes with pressure. It's normal. I'm dealing with it and enjoying it. I hope it pushes me on a notch.

‘Working with the players at Liverpool and playing in elite competitions is only going to improve my game. I really hope it does. It's hard to be at your best every game nowadays, and the manager has the chance to use his squad in certain games.

‘I wouldn't say I was in great demand. I was aware of Liverpool's interest. Knowing that was attractive for me. I was delighted in the end when I got the opportunity for the deal to be finalised and happen.’
