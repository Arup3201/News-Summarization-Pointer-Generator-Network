Rising numbers of part-time GPs are contributing to a recruitment crisis in the NHS, a report has warned.

More than half of family doctors are women and many work only a few days a week, while more male doctors are choosing to go part-time as they juggle managerial roles.

In a report published in the BMJ, Professor Veronica Wilkie, who specialises in primary care at the University of Worcester, said the NHS urgently needed to boost GP numbers.

She said: ‘We have too few GPs, and those we do have are stressed, burning out, and feeling increasingly unable to deliver healthcare safely.’

Earlier this year figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre showed the number of women GPs had overtaken men for the first time.

There are now 20,440 females – a rise of 50 per cent in a decade – compared with 19,800 men. 

Many women work less after having children and eventually leave the profession altogether, often blaming the long hours.

Only last month the Royal College of GPs warned that as many as 500 surgeries could close across England as so many GPs are nearing retirement.

Professor Wilkie added: ‘They are not being replaced by younger doctors as it is deemed highly stressful and unrewarding.  

‘We need a coherent plan for workforce development in primary care, taking into account undergraduate and postgraduate training and beyond, with a robust funding plan that is flexible enough to reflect the local population’s needs but big enough to prevent further disintegration and a lack of investment.’
