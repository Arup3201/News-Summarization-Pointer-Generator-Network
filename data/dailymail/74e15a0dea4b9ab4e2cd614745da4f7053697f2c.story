New love interest? The Italian magazine at the centre of the royal privacy row also published pictures of Pippa with a male companion

The Italian magazine at the centre of the royal privacy row has published photographs of Pippa Middleton holding hands with a mystery man.

Chi magazine caused outrage by running front page pictures of the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge in a bikini while on a family holiday in Mustique.

Now it has emerged that the same edition, published yesterday, also features pictures of her younger sister with a new love interest.

Prince William and Kate flew to the private Caribbean island last week and were later joined by her parents Carole and Michael Middleton and siblings Pippa and James.

But unauthorised photographs of the family taken on the beach emerged in the Italian magazine, and are also due to be published in Australia.

Chi printed pictures of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge paddling in the sea together beneath headlines such as ‘the belly grows’ and ‘honeymoon for three’.

They also showed party planner Pippa in an orange and pink-striped bikini holding hands with a broad, brown-haired man.

Looking tanned and toned, she is pictured smiling up at her companion, who wears black patterned swim shorts and sunglasses, as they walk along the beach.

In another photograph, they are walking side-by-side with James Middleton, who is sporting a deep tan and blue swim shorts.

Chi magazine, owned by disgraced ex-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, said they showed Pippa with her ‘boyfriend’ James Matthews, a wealthy businessman whom she was understood to be dating before Christmas.

However, sources close to Mr Matthews, 37, denied it was him in the photographs, suggesting Pippa has a new man in her life.

Eton-educated Mr Matthews – whose brother Spencer stars in reality show Made in Chelsea – was said to be at his office in London yesterday, where he is chief executive of the Eden Rock Capital Management Group.

Pippa has not been in a serious relationship since she split with her boyfriend-of-three-years, City banker Alex Loudon, in November 2011, although she has been linked to several aristocratic suitors.

On Tuesday, a spokesman for St James’s Palace said they were ‘disappointed’ that the photographs of the Duke and Duchess had been published and branded it ‘a clear breach of the couple’s right to privacy.’

One photograph shows Kate tying her hair up while she stands knee-deep in the crystal clear waters – with her rounded stomach on show – and her husband close by.

Another shows her wading through the
 sea, next to the caption, ‘The bump is starting to show and the 
princess has a softer figure than what she had on her honeymoon in 2011 
in the Seychelles’.

Photographs of their private honeymoon in the Seychelles are also published on the same page.

Last night the magazine remained defiant about running a six-page special about the couple’s break to Mustique.

Defiant: Chi also published pictures of Pippa holding hands with a mystery man on the beach

‘Referring
 to the photographs as ‘unexceptional’ and ‘not scandalous’, Chi’s 
editor Alfonso Signorini said: ‘You cannot talk of a violation of 
privacy when we are publishing pictures taken in a public place in the 
open air such as a beach, where there are other swimmers.

‘In any case the Italian press doesn’t have a gentleman’s agreement with the [British] royal family.

‘It’s about a serene moment between a loving couple, smiling. Where is the scandal?’

Ironically,
 the article says the royal couple ‘hope’ that their villa ‘is big 
enough to accommodate their bodyguards, who are there to protect them 
from chance incidents like the pictures of Kate topless that appeared 
last summer’.

Chi was among the publications that published topless photographs of the Duchess, taken while she was staying at a private villa in France last summer.

In 2006, the magazine infamously ran a picture of Princess Diana as she lay dying in the back of a car when her vehicle crashed in Paris.

Yesterday, Woman’s Day magazine in Australia announced they had bought 39 photographs of the couple’s holiday in Mustique for almost £100,000. They plan to publish them on Monday.

They claimed the photographs were taken by a member of the public who was staying on the island and not the paparazzo.

Editor Fiona Connolly said: ‘She is on a public beach and she was mingling with holiday makers. There are other holiday makers in the photos.

‘These photos have not been taken by a professional photographer hiding in the bushes.

‘They are not nude photos taken with a telescopic lens from inside a private villa.

‘These are images showing her on a happy holiday, and she looks amazing.’

Despite her protests, it is possible that a photographer posed as a member of the public in order to gain access to the couple.

Either way, it is an embarrassment for the island, which prides itself on providing on and off-shore security  for guests staying at its 74 exclusive villas.

Mrs Connolly said: ‘I think the British are very sensitive about this.

‘As Australians, we see this every day. We see pregnant women in bikinis on the beach – and a public one at that – so we are a lot less sensitive here in Australia.’

The royal family launched legal action last year against the French magazine Closer over the topless images taken in France.

A court in Paris granted an injunction banning further publication of the photographs, but the case is still on-going after the magazine appealed the decision.
