USA midfielder Jermaine Jones and his former Miss Germany
wife Sarah wore matching outfits to a private party on Tuesday, and the
footballer’s choice of shoes show he continues to sparkle despite his World Cup
campaign finishing more than two weeks ago.

Jones, who was a key part of Jurgen Klinsmann’s side in
Brazil, has clearly not grown tired of wearing exactly the same clothes as those
around him.

The pair both wore denim shirts, with Jermaine opting for
ripped white jeans and sparkling plimsolls, and Sarah choosing a white shirt
and matching studded stilettos.

Jones and his wife, who married in 2007, have five children, all of whom joined
him in Brazil to support Jurgen Klinsmann’s side.

The midfielder is a free agent after spending the second half
of last season at Besiktas, and has recently admitted he would love to play in
MLS having spent his whole career in Europe.

'We are trying to find a way I can play in MLS, the
32-year-old told Fox Sports. ‘But now is not my step, it is the step of the
MLS.

Home from home: Johnson played against the country of his birth, Germany, at the World Cup

‘They have to give me what I want. I showed them that I am
in good shape, that I can help the league to grow and it is up to them.'

Other than his short spells at Blackburn Rovers and
Besiktas, the Frankfurt-born footballer has spent his entire career in Germany,
making 165 Bundesliga appearances for Eintracht Frankfurt, Bayer Leverkusen and
Schalke.
