A mother was kicked out of a pizzeria for changing her baby's diaper at her table.

But mother Miranda Sowers says she was forced into the situation since the restaurant doesn't provide changing tables in their restroom.

The incident happened at Brother's Pizza Express in Spring, Texas, where Sowers took her three daughters for a meal.

Asked to leave: Texas mother Miranda Sowers (left) was kicked out of a pizzeria when she changed her 4-month-old daughter's diaper at a table in the restaurant. She says she was forced into the situation since there was no changing table in the restroom and she was alone with her other two daughters

She went to the bathroom to change 4-month-old daughter Reagan, but discovered they didn't have a changing table.

Since she was alone with the children, including 4-year-old daughter Lauren and 8-year-old daughter Katelyn, Sowers says she didn't want to take them all back outside to the car.

So she changed her baby at her table and believes no customers saw her.

'I thought you know what I've got my own changing pad, she's tiny, she fits right here on the chair,' Sowers told KHOU. 'So I laid her down quickly and quietly changed her diaper.'

The incident happened at this pizzeria in Spring, Texas. The restaurant owners have stood by their decision to ask Sowers to leave

But manager Donny Lala, whose family owns the restaurant, says customers started complaining.

'As soon as you start opening the diaper, people start complaining about the smell of the diaper,' Lala manager. 'Last thing I want is a customer throwing up.'

So Sowers' order was brought out in to-go packaging and she was asked to leave.

Sowers has since filed a complaint with the better business bureau.

While the owners of Brothers Pizza Express stand by their decision, they say they are looking into investing in changing tables.

According to federal law, restaurants and stores do not need to provide changing tables - or even restrooms for that matter.
