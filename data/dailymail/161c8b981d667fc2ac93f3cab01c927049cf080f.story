Twitter has introduced a new ‘buy’ button that will allow users to make purchases directly through tweets.

The button, which is currently only available to a small percentage of U.S. users, will appear at the bottom right of partner tweets in the Twitter apps on iOS and Android.

To make a purchase you simply tap the button, review product details and enter your shipping and payment information at the prompt. Once complete, Twitter will send an order confirmation. 

‘An an entire purchase can be completed in just a few taps,’ the company boasts in a blog post introducing the feature.  

Shopping via Twitter: Users can purchase concert tickets and limited edition items such as this T-shirt supporting (RED), a nonprofit focused on fighting AIDS

Twitter has partnered with social shopping platform, Fancy, ecommerce companies Gumroad and Musictoday, and mobile payment startup, Stripe to develop the functionality, and has rolled out the service with a number of notable brands, nonprofits and music artists. 

Current participants include Burberry, The Home Depot, Demi Lovato, Pharrell, Paramore and (RED), with more to come.

For now the feature is focused on selling limited-edition and time sensitive items such as concert tickets and T-shirts, however, a wider variety of products may become available as the button evolves.

The company also stressed the measures it’s taken to ensure security of user information.

‘Your payment and shipping information is encrypted and safely stored after your first transaction, so you can easily buy on Twitter in the future without having to re-enter all of your information,’ Tarun Jain, Group Product Manager explains.

‘Of course, you can always remove this information from your account. Your credit card is processed securely and won’t be shared with the seller without your permission.’

It’s a big move for Twitter, experts say, and emphasizes the company's efforts to monetize the service in new ways.

The social networking service has previously experimented with ecommerce by allowing users to add products to their Amazon carts by tweeting the hashtag #AmazonCart, and by partnering with Starbucks for their Tweet a Coffee program, which enabled users to exchange $5 gift certificates via tweets.

Facebook also announced it had been testing its own buy button back in July, though the feature has yet to roll out globally.
