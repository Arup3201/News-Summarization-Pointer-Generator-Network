Mobile phone firms are warned today they will be forced to allow customers to swap freely between rival networks unless they end the scandal of blackspots afflicting a fifth of the country.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid revealed he favoured a system of 'national roaming' to eliminate poor signals that leave millions unable to make calls.

He also said the Government will provide £150 million to fund 'hundreds' of new mobile phone masts providing coverage to the most rural areas.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, pictured checking his mobile as he arrived at the Houses of Parliament on Friday, said not being able to get a signal should be part of the modern world

In an interview with the Daily Mail ahead of the Conservatives' annual conference, which starts this weekend in Birmingham, Mr Javid said he backed campaigners who complain that in parts of the country telephone reception is worse than in India and Malawi.

'When we first started using mobiles 25 years or so ago, it was a luxury. But today, the idea that you can't use a mobile to have a conversation wherever you are in the UK is not part of the modern world.

'I see this as a national utility that we should all be able to use. It's not just about lifestyle, it's absolutely vital for a modern economy,' Mr Javid said.

'In the UK, at a national level, we don't have roaming. So a French person coming to Wales gets a better signal that someone does as a local. It is such a big problem that something needs to be done.'

Mr Javid said so-called 'not spots', where there is no signal at all, were mostly in remote, rural communities. 'For that, we're starting a specific programme with £150 million of government money,' he said.

'We'll get a third party to put up masts in those areas and mobile operators have committed to plug into that. 

'Obviously, they have to go through the planning process, but we are talking about hundreds of masts and we want to get moving quickly. Unless we get the hardware up, we won't see any improvement.

'The second issue is partial not-spots, where one provider might provide a signal, but others don't. You might be able to make a call if you're on O2 but someone on EE can't.

'In terms of numbers of people that are affected, it's a bigger problem – about 20 per cent of the country in terms of geography.

'I've experienced it in my constituency in North Worcestershire, which has some very rural parts. I share people's frustration.

'I have been pushing a potential solution, which is the idea of national roaming. When you go to Europe, when you switch on your phone it will roam and find the nearest signal and lock onto it.

'It's a software change, not a hardware change. Obviously the mobile phone companies already implement a system of roaming for international customers. The concept isn't new.'

Mobile phone firms could be forced to share their masts so customers can latch on to any signal, regardless of whether it is their provider's

The Culture Secretary said he had discussed the proposal with industry regulator Ofcom, who had 'made it clear to me that from a technical point of view, it's feasible'.

'From a commercial point of view, this wouldn't be the first choice of the operators, but Ofcom is telling me that it can be made to work,' he added.

'I am just not happy with how the mobile companies have behaved on this. I have said to them that unless they can come up with something equally compelling, that will work well and can be done in a reasonable timeframe, I'm minded to push ahead with this. They should know that the Government is absolutely serious.

'Unless they come up with something else, then this is my preferred option. There are various ways of doing it, whether through regulation or legislation.'

Greg Clark, now a Cabinet Office minister, attempted to change the law before the last election by introducing a 'right to roam' Bill in the Commons.

As well as improving coverage in remote areas, the Tories believe that in areas where there are good signals, such as towns and suburbs, roaming would remove the need for duplicated mobile phone masts.

Prime Minister David Cameron has voiced his frustration at not being able to make calls to world leaders while on holiday in Cornwall

It would mean a phone call is transferred to the nearest mast, even if it is run by a rival company to that the caller is signed up to.

Mobile phone firms have been reluctant to agree to roaming because they have funded the costs of erecting masts themselves, and do not want to share them with rivals.

Prime Minister David Cameron is understood to have become increasingly frustrated by dropped calls in his Witney constituency – and also in Downing Street, which is a notorious mobile phone blackspot even though it is in the heart of the capital.

In June he revealed his struggle to keep in touch with world leaders while on holiday in Cornwall, because he could not get a mobile signal.

The Prime Minister has been forced to drive to the top of a hill to get a connection on his phone to deal with the fall of Gaddafi in Libya and the bloody civil war in Syria.

Mr Cameron, who holidays in Cornwall every year, said it was ‘very frustrating’ that parts of the country were still left in ‘not-spots’ without a decent phone signal. 

David Heath, a former environment minister and Lib Dem MP for Somerton and Frome, said he had to 'squat against the sink' to take phone calls from his office because of poor mobile phone coverage in his constituency.
