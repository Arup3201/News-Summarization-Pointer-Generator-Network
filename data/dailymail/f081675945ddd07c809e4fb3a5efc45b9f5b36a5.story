A pet dog had to be rescued by a fire crew after getting stuck in a hole in a wall.

Junior, a German shepherd Collie cross, had to be drilled out from the wall in his owner's house after poking his head through the space once used for a tumble dryer vent while he was in the garden. 

When his owner Raymond Edmonds went to let the dog back inside the house in Wolverhampton, he was shocked to see the animal's body sticking out from the wall - with his head firmly wedged in the hole.

West Midlands Fire Service firefighters arrived at the house in Wolverhampton and drilled the animal to safety

After trying to free him with shampoo, Mr Edmonds was forced to phone the fire brigade for help.

'It was raining outside and I could hear Junior barking out in the garden but when I went to the porch to let him in I had the shock of my life,' he said. 

'He had pushed his head through an old vent for a dryer I used to have and he was just peering at me through the wall. 

'I was so shocked and I didn't know what on earth to do.' 

The 33-year-old phoned West Midlands Fire Service to the house where firefighters were able to cut the animal free.

The 'crazy' animal was not harmed in the process of being freed but won't be sticking his head in any other holes in the near future, said his owner 

Once recovered, Mr Edmonds, who is a DJ, released photographs of his pet's ordeal to showcase the fire crew's good work. 

'Junior is a crazy dog and he coped with the ordeal really well. The firefighters who attended did an excellent job of getting Junior out of the hole, without distressing him.

'It’s safe to say, Junior won’t be putting his head in any other holes in a hurry.'
