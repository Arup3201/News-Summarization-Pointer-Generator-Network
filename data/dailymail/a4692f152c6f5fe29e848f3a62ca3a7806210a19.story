The Duchess almost suffered a major wardrobe malfunction yesterday as she arrived in a short pleated navy skirt and matching jacket at Place2Be, a London-based anti-bullying charity.

As she bent down to accept a posy from nine-year-old Tierney Potter, a pupil at St Edmund's School in Tower Hamlets, her skirt blew up in a gust of wind.

And it's not the first time Kate's had a Marilyn moment: a feather-light
 Jenny Packham yellow frock almost cost Kate her modesty at Calgary 
Airport in September 2011, and she almost came a 
cropper in a floral Project D dress as she arrived at Brisbane airport in 2012.

The Duchess of Cambridge almost suffered a wardrobe malfunction as she arrived at a forum for the charity Place2Be on Wednesday

As she bent down to accept a posy from local schoolgirl Tierney Potter outside the offices of Clifford Chance, her skirt blew up in a gust of wind

Kate wore a specially designed Jenny Packham 
primrose yellow shift dress during her tour of Canada, and had a slight 
wardrobe malfunction on the windy runway at Calgary Airport.

And in May this year, when seven months pregnant, the Duchess of 
Cambridge was hit by another unfortunate gust of wind as she arrived at the wedding of friends 
Willian van Cutsem and Rosie Ruck Keene, in south Oxfordshire.

Kate was left red-faced after a breeze lifted up her £38 Topshop polka-dot dress.

This time, the offending skirt was by Orla Kiely
 skirt and her jacket by MaxMara. She also wore a pair of gloves 
by Cornelia James, a £245 Russell and 
Bromley blue suede Muse bag and Alexander McQueen heels.

Kate should perhaps take a leaf out of the Queen's book.

Last year the Mail revealed how, 
despite conducting thousands of public engagements in her 60 years on 
the throne, the Queen’s decorum has almost never slipped.

Slipped
 inside the lining of each of the Queen’s exquisite hand-made outfits 
are a couple of small lead curtain weights, costing just £1.50 for a 
packet of four.

Whoops: A seven months pregnant Duchess of 
Cambridge was hit by an unfortunate gust of wind which blew up her skirt
 and exposed her thighs

The small circular weights, measure just 1.2inches (32mm) across and weigh less than an ounce each - but prevent the royal hemline from flying away in a gust of wind.

Jenny Packham revealed that she'd received a letter recommending that very trick after pictures of Kate in her billowing yellow dress surfaced last year.

'I had a little handwritten letter 
from a lady in Wisconsin passionately criticising me for the primrose 
yellow shift dress I made for the duchess,' says Packham, who was born in 
Southampton, told London's Evening Standard at the time.

'She said didn't I know about putting weights around the bottom of a hem so it can't blow up?

'Well,
 I didn't know it was going to be worn on a windy runway - but I did 
think maybe in future I will put in more weighting, just in case...'

Disembarking:
 The Duchess looked elegant in the pretty floral Project D dress when arriving at Brisbane aiport - and 
successfully managed to contain her skirt when a gust of wind threatened
 to pick up the hem

Stuart Parvin, the Queen's favourite couturier, revealed the weights he uses for her dresses are sourced from the curtain accessories section 
of famous Chelsea department store, Peter Jones.

 dressmaker Mr Parvin then neatly stitches them into the hem of her 
garments, which prevents them from blowing up in the wind.

The
 surprisingly cheap trick seems to work, for the Queen has seemingly 
never been photographed in public looking even remotely ruffled.

‘The
 beauty of a handmade outfit is that it hangs just right but, of course,
 we have a few tricks up our sleeve,’ Mr Parvin told the Daily Mail in 
an exclusive interview.

 Her pleated skirt was by Orla Kiely skirt and her matching navy jacket was by MaxMara

Kate was attending the charity's 'Resilience and Emotional Strength in Schools Forum' at the offices of Clifford Chance in Canary Wharf, London

Kate seemed to be enjoying the day, despite the chilly - and rather windy- weather

‘Surprisingly,
 it is nothing fancy. I use curtain weights, lead weights, from Peter 
Jones’s curtain department. We call them penny weights.'

‘I just pop a couple into the hemline of her dresses and coats and it makes them hang beautifully. If
 there is a flap in the coat then I will sew in one on each side of the 
split to even it up. And sometimes if she is wearing a lightweight 
chiffon skirt I will sew in an even smaller lead weight the size of a 
pea or even a length of chain, rather like a dog’s chain. But the 
curtain weights work beautifully.’

Unfortunately not all female royals follow the Queen’s lead and have, on occasions, fallen foul of the elements.

The late Diana, 
Princess of Wales, the Duchess of York and her daughter, Princess 
Beatrice, have all suffered similar wardrobe malfunctions.

St Edmunds is one of more than 200 schools across the country which works in partnership with Place2Be to offer mental health support services

Kate explained to the professors that yesterday on a visit with Prince William to crime prevention charity Only Connect she had been hearing about 'sexting', the exchange of graphic pictures and messages on mobile phones

Kate took the opportunity while at the event to speak to experts about early years development, asking Prof Byron specifically about babies and toddlers
