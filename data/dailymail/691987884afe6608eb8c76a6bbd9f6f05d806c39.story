Paedophile: Lee Crabtree, 27, of South Shields, who was caught grooming children online by a mother posing as a 13-year-old girl in web chats

A mother posed as an underage girl online as a honey trap to lure a paedophile who had been preying on youngsters over the Internet, a court heard.

The woman - whose name has not been revealed - invented the online persona of a 13-year-old girl called 'sweet as candy' to tempt Lee Crabtree of South Shields, Tyne and Wear, into incriminating himself.

The 27-year-old had been using the Internet in an effort to groom young girls into underage sex, so she turned the tables by posing as a teenager to draw him into live web chats.

She then passed all the information she had gathered to police who were able to use it to track down Crabtree and arrest him.

Yesterday
 Crabtree pleaded guilty to four charges of causing or inciting a child 
to engage in sexual activity at Newcastle Crown Court.

Wheelchair-bound
 Crabtree also admitted two counts of attempting to meet a child 
following sexual grooming and will be sentenced on March 10.

He
 had faced two charges relating to his online chats with 'sweet as 
candy', but prosecutors chose to drop those after he admitted the other 
offences.

Prosecutor Amanda
 Rippon said: “The two counts are the mother, who was pretending to be 
her daughter. It is how he was discovered effectively.

'The prosecution say he did communicate with "sweet as candy" but it was the mother and that is how he was found.'

The Law Courts on Newcastle upon Tyne's Quayside: Crabtree was bailed ahead of pre-sentence reports, but a judge warned him that prison was 'almost inevitable' and he was ordered to sign the sex offenders' register

Judge
 Paul Sloan QC warned Crabtree that a prison sentence was ‘almost 
inevitable’ and he was ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register 
before being allowed to leave court on bail.

'The fact I am adjourning sentence and directing the preparation of a report is not an indication of sentence,' the judge said.

The offences relate to a total of four underage victims, the court was told.
