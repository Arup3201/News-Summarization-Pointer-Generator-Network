Former Defence Force chief, Angus Houston, and the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, have been named as Australia's next knights.

In a statement issued on Tuesday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the Queen accepted his recommendation that the Duke of Edinburgh and Air Chief Marshal Houston 'be awarded Australia's highest honour as Knights of the Order of Australia'.

Mr Abbott said Prince Philip was receiving the honour to recognise his contribution to Australia over the course of the Queen's 62-year reign.

'Prince Philip's long life of service and dedication should be honoured by Australia,' Mr Abbott said.

'For three quarters of a century, Prince Philip has served the Crown, and the wider Commonwealth.

'He has served Australia with distinction and is patron of over 800 organisations.'

He said the The Duke of Edinburgh's Award in Australia had 'supported the development of young Australians for more than fifty years'.

Mr Abbott said Air Chief Marshal Houston's knighthood was to recognise his 'extraordinary and pre-eminent achievement and merit in service to Australia over many years'.

Mr Abbott praised Air Chief Marshal Houston, who served in the armed forces for more than forty years, rising to become Chief of Air Force in 2001 and Chief of the Defence Force in 2005.

He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2003 and made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2008.

Since retiring from the military in 2011, he has worked as Chairman of the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board, Chairman of Airservices Australia and Chairman of the Council for the Order of Australia.

'Successive governments have relied on Sir Angus' wisdom, judgment and character,' Mr Abbott said.

'Throughout his life, Sir Angus has put Australia first.

'He immigrated to Australia as an adult, he chose Australia and we are much the better for it.'

This year's knighthoods follow last year's appointments, which were the first since the system of knights and dames was reinstated by Mr Abbott.

The Duke of Edinburgh's Award has helped young Australians for more than fifty years

The first dame under the changes was the former governor-general Quentin Bryce and the first knight was her replacement, Governor-General Peter Cosgrove.

Up to four knights or dames can be appointed in any year.

The British system was reintroduced in March 2014 after Gough Whitlam in 1976 won the approval of the Queen for an Australian system of honours and awards.

Before then, prominent and deserving Australians were included in the Order of the British Empire.
