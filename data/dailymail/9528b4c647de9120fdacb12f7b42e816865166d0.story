Turkey's ban on YouTube has been overturned after the highest court ruled it was a violation of the country's freedom of expression. 

The ruling is a setback for Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan who had advocated shutting down the video-sharing website.

The Constitutional Court ruled that the restrictions on YouTube amounted to a violation of constitutional rights and would notify telecommunications authorities of its decision that access should be restored, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported.

The restrictions on YouTube were imposed in late March after an audio recording of a government security meeting was leaked. 

In the recording, senior officials appeared to be discussing a possible military intervention in Syria.

In April, Erdogan said he had to comply with the Turkish high court ruling to unblock Twitter but that he didn't agree with the decision.

Turkey blocked access to Twitter also in March after some users posted links suggesting government corruption.

It then later blocked access to YouTube.

Erdogan had vowed to 'rip out the roots' of Twitter for allowing the postings.

However, the government lifted the Twitter ban, a day after the high court ruled that it violated the right to free expression.

Erdogan said of the court's decision: 'I don't have to respect it. I don't respect it.'

He said the court was protecting a tool of foreign influence, saying that Twitter is 'the product of an American company.'

'All of our national moral values are being set aside,' Erdogan added.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been ordered by a judge in southern Iran to appear in court to answer complaints about the company violating privacy.

Individuals say applications including Instagram and Whatsapp, a deal of which has not yet been completed, violate their privacy.

It is highly unlikely that Zuckerberg would appear in an Iranian court since there is no extradition treaty between Iran and the United States.

Some Iranian courts have in recent years issued similar rulings that could not be carried out.
