He may be football's archetypal bad boy, but Mario Baloteli proved he's not too cool for school by posting a heart warming good luck message to youngsters heading back to class this week.

The Liverpool striker took to his Instagram account to send the message: 'Hi kids, today starts school in most countries. It's like the beginning of the season in football. It's therefore time to start giving Your best as this helps shape your future. Good luck!'

The message was accompanied by a short video, where the 24-year-old sagely advises: 'Study hard and play harder. I wish all children good luck for your first day of school'.

Super Mario: Balotelli has previous helping out kids, having confronted a bully during his last spell in the UK

It's not the first time that Balotelli has intervened on British school life, after the former Manchester City striker reportedly returned a truant back to school to confront his bully during his first spell in the Premier League.  

The Italy international has returned to England after being snapped up by Brendan Rodgers for a relative steal of £16million from AC Milan.

Balotelli appeared good value for money in his debut where, despite missing several chances, he combined well with Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling in Liverpool's 3-0 victory over Tottenham.

However, the Italian maverick is always accompanied by unpredictability and a rash challenge and subsequent altercation with referee Chris Foy led to him being substituted for his own safety in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Wolves last week.

Liverpool fans will be hoping it was a lesson learned outside of the classroom for the league's most entertaining player.
