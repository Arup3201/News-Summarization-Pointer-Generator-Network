Soldiers from Commonwealth countries have been banned from joining Britain’s Armed Forces unless they have lived here for five years.

The residency test, which came into force yesterday, will prevent overseas recruits joining immediately as they do now.

The Ministry of Defence reinstated the requirement, which was scrapped in 1998, as it attempts to reduce the size of the military by nearly 30,000 troops.

Cutbacks: Commonwealth citizens will be require to have lived in Britain for five years before they are eligible to join the Armed Forces

Recruits from Commonwealth countries have a long and distinguished history of serving in the Armed Forces.

In the First World War, 1.2million men from the Indian Army fought alongside the Allies with 74,000 losing their lives.

Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and South Africa all lent troops during World War Two.

And Britain's Commonwealth companions have proved to be brave in the battlefield.

Johnson Beharry, pictured above, originally from Grenada, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his valour while serving in Iraq.

Others to have been given the highest military honour include two Australians Keith Payne and Rayene Stewart Simpson for their actions in the Vietnam War.

But the controversial move could lead
 to accusations of betrayal because Commonwealth troops have shed blood 
for the UK on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan – as well as in 
previous conflicts such as the two world wars.

In the past decade 24 Commonwealth soldiers have been killed in conflict. Dozens more have been wounded.

If the rules had been in place when 
Sergeant Johnson Beharry arrived in Britain from the Caribbean island of
 Grenada in 1999, he would not have been permitted to join the Army in 
2001.

And the soldier, who serves with the 
1st Battalion the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment, would not have 
been on the Iraq battlefield in 2004, when he won the Victoria Cross for
 twice saving comrades in ambushes.

Typically, 500 Commonwealth soldiers 
are among the 7,000 new recruits each year and the residency rule could 
leave the Forces perilously overstretched if they failed to recruit 
enough British soldiers.

Throughout the infantry, about one in
 ten soldiers is from outside Britain. Many join units that fail to 
recruit their full complement of soldiers  at home.

But Armed Forces Minister Mark 
Francois said the rule was unavoidable as the military coped with 
sweeping cuts. In a written ministerial statement he acknowledged the 
contribution of Commonwealth citizens serving in the British Armed 
Forces.

But he added: ‘In order to deliver 
the future structure of the Armed Forces under the requirements of the 
Strategic Defence and Security Review, we are already reducing their 
size by adjusting our recruit intake and making some redundancies.

‘We are confident that we will still  be able to meet our recruitment targets.’

Change: The ruling had been scrapped in 1998 but is now being reinstated, effective immediately

The changes will not affect Gurkhas or those from the Republic of Ireland, Cyprus and Malta.

Labour defence spokesman Jim Murphy 
said: ‘When rightly recruiting those from the UK, ministers must never 
undermine the many sacrifices and commitments made by those from the 
Commonwealth who have served on frontlines across the globe in the name 
of British national security.

‘The country will want to know this is based on the best possible military advice and nothing else.’
Colonel Richard Kemp, who  commanded British forces in Afghanistan, 
praised the long tradition of ‘sterling service’ that Commonwealth 
soldiers have provided – ‘and still provide’ – in the Army.

He said the Armed Forces had 
‘depended heavily’ on Commonwealth troops to bring units up to strength 
and accused the MoD of using ineffective recruiting techniques.

But he added: ‘However, at a time 
when our Armed Forces are reducing to the lowest levels in more than a 
century, it is right that priority should be given to British citizens.’

An MoD spokesman said: ‘At a time 
when we are having to reduce the  size of our Armed Forces, it is only 
right we focus on recruiting  UK personnel.’
