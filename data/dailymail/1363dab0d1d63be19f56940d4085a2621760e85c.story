Cow's urine may soon be used to clean the floors of India's government offices in a country where the animals are considered sacred and their bodily waste therapeutic and even thirst-quenching.

A charity working to care for the cows that freely roam India's streets has developed a cleaning product from their urine.

The product, which has been distilled and scented, is the latest in a long line of items made from bovine bodily waste. Other products range from soap to urine-based medicines and even a soft drink.

'Initially when we tried the product, it had too strong a smell. Nobody would have used it. So we have distilled the urine now and added natural ingredients like pine oil to cover the smell,' said Anuradha Modi from the Holy Cow Foundation.

Ms Modi said she was working on a deal to get the company that supplies housekeeping items to government offices to use the product - which is called 'Gaunyle', with gau the Hindi word for cow.

'We have tested the product in labs and we can say that it is much better than the phenyl that you get in the market which is so full of chemicals,' she told AFP.

'We want to create a market for cow urine and I can say supply won't be a problem.'

Method: The urine is distilled and spiked with natural perfumes to remove the pungent odour

Speaking to the Economic Times, she added: 'The product has been certified 'excellent' by labs in its pest-removing abilities.'

While the sacred status of cows precludes India's huge Hindu majority from eating beef, their waste falls into the same acceptable category as dairy products.

The cow, also known as 'Kamdhenu' - 'that which fulfils human needs' - is described in Hindu scriptures as the 'mother' of civilisation.

Their revered status took on extra significance after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party won a landslide election victory in May last year.

The party's election manifesto pledged to work to protect cows.

On Friday the head of the company that supplies housekeeping products to government offices praised the urine cleaner.

'It is a great product for the health of safai karamcharis (cleaners) as well as for the cows,' Jagdish Bhatia said.

Speaking to the Economic Times, he added: 'In 2004, the government employed experts from leading research institutes to find out more about the disinfectant qualities of cow waste but the study was terminated even before the team could reach conclusive results

'However, from the preliminary studies, we understood that cow urine can be a good alternative to phenyl if mixed with the right components of other herbal extracts and scientifically treated.'

Meanwhile, a growing cult of Hindu worshippers in India claim that drinking fresh cow urine will help cure them of all diseases - including cancer.

The believers regard the cow as a holy animal and say her urine has divine healing properties.

In the north Indian city of Agra, a growing cult of Hindu worshippers in India claim that drinking fresh cow urine will help cure them of all diseases - including cancer

Many say the recent increase in the number of people drinking cow urine can be attributed to campaigns run by spiritual leaders.

Followers claim that cow's urine can successfully be used to combat cancer, diabetes, tumours, tuberculosis, stomach problems and much more.

They also claim that drinking cow pee is the only effective solution for treating baldness.
