A fresh band of winter weather that
churned up the East Coast on Saturday, pummeling the storm-weary
region with snow, sleet and freezing rain, was expected to
gradually taper off Sunday morning, forecasters said.

the Northeast by early Sunday, according to the National Weather

should start to ease in many areas by mid-morning, the service
said.

Boston, which had already been hit by 98.7 inches of snow going into the weekend, saw only about an inch Saturday,
but local weather watchers there were forecasting the total
tally to hit 100 inches by midnight. The city's total is well
above the average yearly total of 31 inches.
