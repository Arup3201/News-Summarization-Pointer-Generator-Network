Daily Show host Jon Stewart took his life into his hands on Monday night when he entered the wrestling ring to spar with WWE star Seth Rollins.

The feud had been simmering between the pair for the past two weeks after current Money In The Bank-title holder Rollins claimed that he could do a better job of hosting the Comedy Central show.

Stewart then issued a challenge to Rollins via a cell phone clip before the two men briefly came face-to-face on The Daily Show itself last week when Rollins got Stewart in a headlock.

'Shut your mouth and bring it,' said Rollins and on Monday night in New Jersey that is exactly what Stewart did.

On Monday’s Raw the beef between the two stars had continued as Rollins staged his own version for The Daily Show and called Stewart out to face him.

Stewart, a big WWE fan, walked out to the sound of his show's theme music and then confronting Rollins, calling him 'a swat team stripper with Lady Gaga’s hair.'

Then as Rollins was about to hit Stewart for his insolence, WrestleMania opponent Randy Orton interrupted proceedings and gave Stewart the opportunity to hit Rollins below the belt in the groin. 

The pair’s beef started two weeks ago when Rollins had proudly boasted that he had aspirations beyond being 'the future of WWE'.

'Right now, I am the most talented performer in the entire world. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want,' Rollins told the crowd.

'Hell, if I wanted, I could become president. Or I could take over as host of The Daily Show for Jon Stewart and make that thing actually watchable.'

Stewart, who announced last month that he is leaving his award-winning show after 16 years, responded to Rollins with a short video message in which he warned the wrestler that he was messing with the wrong guy.

'Seth Rollins, you've made a lot of mistakes in your life: Being a turncoat to the Shield, being a toady for the Authority, not being able to choose which color your hair should be – but this is the biggest mistake you ever made,' said Stewart.

'You just stepping in a world of hurt, my friend. I'm coming for you Rollins, and you're gonna see it: 160 pounds of dynamite.'

Stewart then admitted that 'my bone density is not what it used to be,' and instead declared himself '160 pounds of wood, like a soft wood. My point is you messed with the wrong guy!' 

'Right now, I am the most talented performer in the entire world. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want,' Rollins told the crowd.
