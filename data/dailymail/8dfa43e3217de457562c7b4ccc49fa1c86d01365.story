These nude images of Jackie Kennedy Onassis were taken on a Greek beach in 1972 after her own husband tipped off photographers with her exact location, a new book has claimed.

The photographs, which show the former First Lady walking casually along a beach in Skorpios, Greece without a scrap of clothing, were part of a widespread smear campaign by her husband, Greek tycoon Aristotle 'Ari' Onassis, the book claims.

The images, which were splashed across magazines and newspapers worldwide, were taken as the couple endured a turbulent marriage fraught with infidelity, absences and family scorn.

The revelations come from noted Kennedy author Christopher Andersen in his upcoming book 'The Good Son: JFK Jr. and the Mother He Loved'.  

Snapped: Images that appeared in Hustler Magazine show Jackie Onassis Kennedy nude on a Greek beach in 1972. It has emerged that the photographers were tipped off by her own husband, Aristotle Onassis

Plot: Tired of Jackie suing the media for invasion of privacy, her husband gave ten photographers detailed maps and time plans of when she would be on the beach in Skorpios, Greece

The biography about Jackie's son describes how Ari bullied his new wife - constantly deriding her as 'The Widow' during interviews, according to an excerpt published by the New York Daily News.   

Jackie had married Ari in 1968 after he wooed her with gifts and declarations of love - even though her family and friends were never convinced he was the right match for her.

Throughout their relationship, Ari pursued his not-so-secret affair with opera singer Maria Callas - while allegedly using his press contacts to publicly humiliate Jackie for stepping out of line.

Anderson describes the fatal moment that crushed their relationship in 1972: tired of Jackie suing the media for invasion of privacy, Ari gave ten photographers detailed maps and time plans of when 'The Widow' would be on the beach in Skorpios.

Published: The shots were splashed across magazines, earning Jackie the moniker 'Billion Dollar Bush'

Insult: Jackie did not know her own husband was behind the photos and demanded he sue the magazines

The nude shots earned Jackie the moniker 'Billion Dollar Bush', and afforded her children years of cruel bullying.

Shocking: The images appeared in a 1975 edition of Hustler after appearing in an Italian publication

Unaware that her husband was behind the cruel plot, she demanded he sue every publication who had printed the photos.

Instead, he went to his lawyer and demanded a divorce - although they never actually divorced before his death in 1975. He continued to see Callas right up until he died, with friends noting that she had been the real love of his life, the book excerpt notes.

The photograph scandal was the final hit after years of public disputes between Jackie and Ari.

From the moment they married, Ari left her alone and upset for two weeks as he jetted around Europe on 'business'.

After getting wind of her unhappiness, Ari flew to be by her side for a luxurious three-week vacation - before running back to Callas' side in a bid to woo her too.

But when private letters that Jackie wrote to Roswell Gilpatric were exposed in 1970 - including one written days after their wedding - Ari was not quite so ready to support her.

'Dearest Ros,' she had written, 'I would have told you before I left - but then everything happened so much more quickly than I'd planned.

'I saw somewhere what you had said and I was touched - dear Ros - I hope you know all you were and are and will ever be to me - With my love, Jackie.' 

The book notes: 'Ari didn’t mind being portrayed as an uncouth cretin, a pirate, a dirty old man, or even a crook. But the idea of being cuckolded in public... was a blow to his manhood.' 

'His real wife': He started pursuing Callas within weeks of marrying Jackie and kept up the liaison throughout

After the letters emerged, he dined with Callas in public and tipped off photographers that they would be there. He was fully aware that the pictures of him with Callas - 'his real wife' - would be snapped up by US newspapers.

Jackie responded by heading to the same restaurant and sitting at exactly the same table to dine with her husband, as a warning to the mistress that she was still in charge.

Ari apparently enjoyed the women battling for his affections. 

He gleefully boasted about his own dalliances, once telling Johhny Meyer: 'Everybody here knows three things about Aristotle Onassis.

'I'm f***ing Maria Callas, I'm f***ing Jacqueline Kennedy - and I'm f***ing rich.'
