Cristiano Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes has cast doubt on the star making an emotional return to Manchester United and says he will retire at Real Madrid 'when he is 40' while claiming there will not be a player as good as the forward 'for 500 years'.

Mendes, who negotiated Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria's moves to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window, admitted the 29-year-old forward still had a soft spot for the Red Devils.

But in a rare interview with Spanish TV show Elpartidodelas12, the so-called 'super agent' suggested United would have no chance of luring Ronaldo from the Bernabeu.

Mendes was quoted by Mundo Deportivo as saying: 'Ronaldo will retire at Real Madrid when he turns 40. Ronaldo is the best player ever. He keeps improving and while he has affection towards Manchester United, he wants to stay at Real Madrid. 

'There won't be any player as good as him for the next 500 years.' 

'Cristiano holds United dear to his heart because he was there six years. 

'But now he just thinks of the Real Madrid and he will always be there, and he is thrilled.

'People know that it is impossible to get Cristiano Ronaldo to leave Real Madrid.'

United had been told it would cost around £140million to bring Ronaldo back to Old Trafford with Real Madrid likely to demand a £60m transfer fee and the player seeking a four-year contract worth £20m per annum.

Senior Old Trafford sources told Sportsmail that they believe the cost of bringing the World Player of the Year back to the club will in all likelihood prove prohibitive. Ronaldo will be halfway towards his 31st birthday by the start of next season.

Mendes added: 'He is happy there, he has a great relationship with the president, and has a long contract: he will break all the records and then retire at Madrid.

Mendes went on to add that Ronaldo's immediate goal is to win another Champions League trophy with Real Madrid.
