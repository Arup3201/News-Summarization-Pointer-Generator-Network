Two lesbians in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania became the targets of what appears to be a hate crime Wednesday while leaving a McDonald's.

Around 5 p.m., customers started complaining to management at the McDonald's location on the 100 block of South 69th Street, that they saw two women enter the bathroom alone.

The manager entered the second-floor restroom and found the two women engaging in 'sexual relations.'

Attacked: A woman in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania was stabbed after she and another woman were discovered having 'sexual relations' in a McDonald's bathroom

'Everybody should do their own thing but doing it at 5 o'clock in the afternoon in a McDonald's bathroom - whether you're female and female, female and male or male and male - what the f---?' Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told The Daily Delco.

The manager ordered the two women to leave and they agreed - but on their way out they encountered a group of seven or eight people who stared to verbally attack the couple.

Chitwood says at least one person shouted: 'Get out of here you dirty dykes.'

Things turned violent when someone stabbed one of the women.

Reports say it was one of a group of three - a mother in her 40s and her two children.

Early reports stated that the attacker was a minor, while more recent reports say it was their middle-aged mother.

By the time police arrived, the crowd began to scatter, and they were unable to apprehend the stabbing suspect.

Police are now reviewing surveillance tapes from that day to try to identify who stabbed the woman.

The victim, 23, was convinced to seek medical attention and taken to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for treatment.
