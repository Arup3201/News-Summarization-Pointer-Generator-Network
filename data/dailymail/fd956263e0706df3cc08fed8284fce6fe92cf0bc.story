Upon the release of her track You Suck, Abigail received a barrage of negative Tweets, which included threats to her safety.

During her Huffpost Live appearance, Abigail was questioned about the song, which led her to open up about the backlash.

'I learned that boy bands have a very, very strong avid following, they're very passionate...it got a little bit intense, some death threats,' the Little Miss Sunshine star said.

She said of rumoured former flame Michael: 'we never dated, we literally hung out twice, he got me tickets to a One Direction show and we went to dinner and that was it.'
