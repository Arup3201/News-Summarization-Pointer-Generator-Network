The family of Kristen Fonseca, the 16-year-old girl killed in a jet-ski accident by an Australian tourist while they vacationed in Hawaii spoke of their anger as he was released today.

Tyler Dagley, 20, pleaded no contest to third degree negligent homicide charges - a misdemeanor - and will be released due to time served following the August 5th accident when his jet ski collided with Fonseca's resulting in her death the next day.

Speaking before the judges' decision was announced, Fonseca's step-father Mario Cantone said: 'We have a huge hole in our family, and all taken away from us in a split second by an individual who was negligent.'

Tyler Dagley, 20, was with his girlfriend vacationing in Oahu, Hawaii when his jet ski collided with Kristen Fonseca's on August 5th, resulting in her death the next day.

Police in Hawaii said Dagley, 20, was standing up on his jet ski and posing for videos and photographs for his girlfriend before ramming the pretty teen on August 5.

They also said he was going 40 miles per hour - four times the speed Kristen was traveling as the collision caused the teens head to ricochet off the steering column of her jet ski, throwing her into the water.

Appearing at Oahu county jail today, Dagley was faced with members if Fonseca's family, including her mother and father.

'Our family's life is turned upside-down. We are unable to function at home. We go to sleep crying, wake up crying,' said Mario Cantone, Fonseca's step-father.

Unhappy that no felony charges were pressed against Dagley, the Fonseca family spoke of their grief and anger at their sudden loss.

'I cry in the morning, I cry before I go to sleep, I cry randomly during the day looking for justice,' said Evangelina Fonseca, the 16-year-old's mother.

'I mean I'm not trying to make this guy suffer, but I need for him to understand that there's a consequence to every decision we make.

'That's the kind of daughter my daughter was, a very forgiving child, and so I know that it's what she would want me to do.'

Reading a poem that her daughter composed when she was eight-years-old, Mrs. Fonseca's hands trembled as she read her dead daughter's words.

Kristen Fonseca's poem wonders out loud if she will ever have children and how she wants to be a doctor when she grows up.

Tyler Dagley reportedly cried as he heard his victim's words and will be asked to pay $78,000 in restitution to the family for his actions.

Monique Sanchez, Kristen's sister told ABC News she witnessed the crash that killed her sister.

'He was just speeding really fast and then just came up and just slammed right into her,' said Sanchez.

The tragic teen's step-father Mario Cantone also spoke to ABC News of what he saw when the accident occurred.

'I then saw her head lunge forward, and hit the steering wheel. Kristen then fell forward, fell back and then fell into the water,' said Cantone.

'As far as I'm concerned that is not enough, that individual was operating the Jet Ski in a totally unsafe negligent manner,' her step-father, Mario Cantone, told Fox 40.

The family is now suing Dagley, claiming they 'have suffered horrible emotional pain, suffering and distress' after witnessing the horrific crash, which took place at Keehi Boat Harbour on the southern coast of Oahu, about five miles from Waikiki Beach.

They are seeking an unspecified amount of damages, including medical and funeral expenses.

According to investigators, Dagley was standing on his rented watercraft before it hit the teenager's jet ski from behind. He was allegedly looking at his girlfriend, who was taking photos and filming him, and not paying attention to where he was going.

Dagley's girlfriend Natasha Ryan, 21, is charged with hindering his prosecution after she told investigators he was sitting down and looking straight ahead before the collision, and that she didn't see the crash.

However, a forensic computer examiner recovered two deleted videos from the memory stick in Ryan's camera which showed the crash.

Court documents said that in the video, Dagley appears to be standing on the watercraft and that someone is heard yelling 'watch out.'

Ryan was released on $500 bail and is shown in her mug shot to be extremely distressed and she will appear in court this Friday.

Dagley, who suffered spinal injuries and a concussion in the crash, said he deeply regretted the accident and prayed Kristen would be OK before hearing of her death.

'Ever since I was in the hospital I prayed everyday, just to the family, and prayed that everything was going to be okay with the girl,' Dagley, who has now been in custody a week, said in court.

Court documents say Dagley was heard at the scene saying, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't believe what I did. I'm so sorry.'

In a lawsuit filed on Monday in Honolulu's circuit court, the Fonseca family also names Aloha Jet Ski, the company that rented the watercrafts to the pair, as a defendant.

The suit claims employees did nothing to prevent Dagley from driving recklessly.

An employee who rented the jet ski to Fonseca's family and Dagley 'failed to give any instructions or warnings about driving at excessive speeds' before handing the man control, the papers state.

Kristen was due to begin a work placement as a nurse at Kaiser Permanente in Vacaville on Wednesday, said her step-father, who, along with the rest of her family has returned home.

'She was excited about that. She just hated to see people in pain or hurt,' he said.

Her classmates were struggling to come to terms with the loss of the bubbly teen.

'Just to know she’s not coming back, it’s still unreal for all of us,' Lyna Jackson, a friend of Kristen's, told Fox.

Another friend, Halie Cunningham, said: 'It's really hard to deal with right now but we'll get through it. We all came out here to support her and her family and her mom.'
