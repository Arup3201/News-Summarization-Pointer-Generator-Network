A village football team branded the worst in Britain after losing a string of 30 matches has finally netted its first win.

Unlucky, Madron FC lost every match last season and conceded a staggering 407 goals.

Hammerings included a 16-0 and 27-0 defeat and a rock bottom after a 55-0 drubbing at the hands of local rivals Illogan.

However, players were celebrating yesterday after chalking up their first win - a 4-3 victory over bottom of the table Storm FC.

The Trelawny league team from Penzance, Cornwall, have faired better this season with a goal difference of minus 16 having conceded 22 goals after four games.

Club secretary, treasurer and chairman for the last 26 years Alan Davenport said there were huge celebrations at the final whistle when they claimed their 4-3 victory.

He said: 'It was a nervy last few minutes and I was terrified they were going to nick an equaliser but fair play to the boys, they held on for the win. 

'The lads went crazy at the final whistle, and why not? It was a big win for them.

'Its been a long time coming for this club and was a proud moment.

'I know we were a bit of a laughing stock before but at least we are finally on the up. 

'It
was pretty depressing last season. No-one likes to turn up every week 
and get thumped and the 55-0 loss was a real low point'.

Mr Davenport put the club's recent success down to an influx of new players after the run of miserable defeats suffered last season.

He added: 'We had a lot of interest after last season I think people felt sorry for us and wanted to offer their skills and support. 

'There are a few of the lads left over from last season so it meant a great deal to them'.

Last season Madron FC lost their opening matches 11-0, 4-1 and 16-0 before going down to heavier defeats.

In November they suffered the humiliating defeat of 55-0 to Illogan with one opposition player bagging ten goals. 

Despite this, Mr Davenport still awarded each player a trophy at the end of the season because the team did not have to cancel a single game. 

He said: 'Even after those humiliating defeats, I could still get a team together every week. 

'Other clubs have been unable to get the players but Madron FC always turned up'.
