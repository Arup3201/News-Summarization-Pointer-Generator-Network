After being pitted against Manchester City in the last 16 of the Champions League, Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi joked that he is looking forward to playing against his close friend Sergio Aguero... as he always beats him at FIFA video games.

The Premier League champions were drawn against Barcelona for the second consecutive season - losing 4-1 on aggregate last term - after edging second place behind Bayern Munich in their qualifying group.

Messi took to Facebook after the draw was made in Nyon on Monday to express his excitement at the tie and gently tease his childhood friend over his ability with video games.

The Argentina international posted a picture of the pair together with a message: 'Looking forward to playing in the next round of the UEFA Champions League. It'll be really nice to face my friend Sergio Aguero as I always beat him at FIFA, but let's see what happens on the pitch.'

Aguero is currently sidelined with a knee ligament but expected to return for the glamour showdown on  February 24 and March 18 next year - giving him plenty of time to brush up on his gaming skills.

The tie also brings connections for City's director of football Txiki Begiristain, a former Barca player and director. He said 'I will take the time to visit family, friends, I have a lot of friends there at the club.'

He labelled the draw itself 'unbelievable', adding: 'Every tie's the same, we had Bayern Munich and CSKA Moscow in the group phase, and now we have to deal again with Barcelona.

'Beating Bayern Munich and then beating Roma away, we are confident and will arrive in a good moment to these games.'

In other ties for Premier League sides, league leaders Chelsea will take on big-spending Paris Saint Germain while Arsenal had arguably the easiest draw with Arsene Wenger facing his former club Monaco.
