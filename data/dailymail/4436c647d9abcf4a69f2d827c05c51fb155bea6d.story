These pictures show an amazing country mansion which was transformed by its owners from a pig farm into a £1.5 million home.

The farm buildings were included on the land that architect couple Tod Wakefield and Mary Collier bought when they moved into a bungalow near Pulborough, West Sussex, 15 years ago.

And, after battling for three years to get planning permission, the pair converted the buildings and made it their home.

While it retains its original shape, having been converted rather than completely rebuilt, the family's home of six years now boasts four bedrooms - and 154 windows.

This property, converted from a disused pig farm, has gone on the market in West Sussex for £1.5million

It took architects Tod Wakefield and Mary Collier three years to get planning permission after buying the farm

Their home, which they have decided to leave now their two adult children have moved out, has an east wing and a west wing linked by a 34-ft-long dining room.

In addition, the environmentally sustainable Manor Home is fitted with super-insulation to all roof and walls along with underfloor heating.

The former pig farm, which has an abundance of oak features from trees which were previously on site, also has a 5,000-litre subsurface rainwater harvesting tank.

It has been calculated that the south facing glass provides 6.5 kW of heat in the summer while the low winter sun heats up the solid floor.

The ground floor of the east wing has a kitchen/breakfast room, utility room and living room with mezzanine floor.

The west has two studies which also double up as the fourth and fifth bedrooms along with a sitting room and bathroom.

On
 the first floor, there are three bedrooms and two roof terraces which 
overlook the property's three acres of grounds and stunning onward 
views.

Mr Wakefield, an architecture lecturer at the University of Portsmouth, said the couple had spent around £500,000 converting the home - which he estimated had not been used for pigs for 30 years.

Although he admitted he and his wife are hoping to 'down-size' in the area as he approaches retirement age, Mr Wakefield, 64, did not rule out taking on another ambitious design.

He said: 'The thing is, when you are an architect you can never give up on projects like this.'

Nick Ferrier, a director in the Midhurst office of Jackson-Stops & Staff estate agents, described the property as 'unique'

Nick Ferrier, a director of Jackson-Stops & Staff, the estate agents selling Manor Home, described the property as ‘unique’.

He said: ‘We’re used to selling older properties but we were delighted to deal with Manor Home which is very different.

‘I have sold converted chapels and barns but this is the first pig farm. It is one of a kind in every way.

‘The windows, which are all bespoke, keep the house warm and also generate heat.'

He added: ‘It is an exceptional piece of award-winning architecture which really flows. There is so much natural light.

‘It has suited the owners down to the ground but with their children now grown up they don't need as much space and have decided it is time for a new project.’

The architect couple, who have two adult children, have now decided to move on after living at Manor Home for six years
