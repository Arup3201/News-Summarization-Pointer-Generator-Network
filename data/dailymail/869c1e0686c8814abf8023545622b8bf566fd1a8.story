Big Brother, Towie, The Farm... just when you think you've seen them all, a new reality show turns up as the new kid on the block. 

This week, it was the turn of The Real Housewives Of Cheshire - a reality show that stars six WAGs from a county famous for footballers and excess. 

Each of the women had enough sparkle, slap and sass to outshine even the brassiest drag queen from London's Soho, but there was one housewife who appeared head and shoulders above the rest - Ampika Pickston.

Ampika Pickston, 32, from Hale came into money after marrying a rich older man but admits she'd never date an unwealthy man. The Real Housewives of Cheshire star also claims that Brits have a stigma of hatred to people who lead luxurious lives

Ampika, 32, got married to Mark Pickston, 54, a multi-millionaire businessman in her twenties and the couple lived an an enormous mansion in Hale, Cheshire, together.

But the couple have since divorced and the former glamour model has now set up her own beauty salon in order to keep the cash rolling in. 

Despite not actually having the only credential needed to be on The Real Housewives Of Cheshire - being a wife - it is clear why ITVBe producers picked her as part of the six-woman cast; she speaks her mind and more. 

In the first episode of the reality show, Ampika tells cameras: 'I'm not a little rag doll - I'll play with the toys, and when I'm done with you, I'll discard you.'

And when I meet her this week at the ITV studios in London, she is exactly the same. 

Even though it is midday on a rainy weekday afternoon, Ampika is dressed to the nines in vertiginous heels and a tight strapless dress, and wearing more make-up and hairspray than I use in a month.

Ampika is Amazonian tall and beautiful, with a mega-watt smile... and she knows it. 

She is also unapologetic about how she achieved her lifestyle (by marrying a rich older man) and in the first few minutes of out conversation, freely admits that she would never again date someone with a normal-paying job like a fireman. 

When I ask her how she feels about being called a scrounger and a gold-digger, she smiles back, completely unconcerned.

She says: 'At the end of the day, it's very sad, but beauty is currency and if you're a good-looking girl, you've got the options.

'If a guy comes along and says he is happy to look after you, and he will give you this fabulous lifestyle, if you want to engage in that, then what is the harm? 

'It isn't hurting anybody.

'I have been on both sides of the coin; I have had a very privileged life where I haven't lifted a finger, but I've also come back down to earth now and I'm back to the girl that I was before I met my ex-husband - I work seven days a week.

'It doesn't make me a better person or a lesser person. 

'This country has got a stigma of hatred towards people that lead very luxurious lives, they're very jealous and envious.

'I'm really sorry that your six numbers didn't come up on the lottery this week - it's not my problem.'

Ampika was raised by her father in Oldham and went to a private boarding school, but after leaving at 18, she struck out on her own and was earning very little compared to what she has now. 

She met Mark in her early twenties and the couple's relationship quickly turned serious. 

Their 18-year age gap meant that she was heavily criticised by people in her new boyfriend's social circle though and made to feel like a gold digger. 

She said: 'I had a job when I first met him and I wasn't dependent on his finances, but it wasn't on the same level. 

'And I know that a lot of people judged me for getting with someone a lot older.

I did say to him, "You're getting involved in a relationship with me but I don't bring that much to the equation, so people automatically think that I sponge off you."

'He told me, "At the end of the day sweetheart, I'm marrying a woman who is 22 years younger than me who's good eye candy. I'm going to expect people to think that.

'"But I'm happy to look after you and for you to be my wife. And if other people have a problem with that, then it is their problem. It's not our problem."

'And I thought, that's fair enough.'

The couple were married for a few years, but unable to overcome certain differences, they split a several years ago.

However, they remain the best of friends and talk on a regular basis.  

Ampika enjoys many perks of having wealth, including work outs with a personal trainer

But while Ampika's ex was able to overlook the fact that she had little money compared to him when they got together, she claims that she would never be able to do the same with any future boyfriends.  

When I ask if she would consider dating someone with a 'normal' salary, like a fireman, she shakes her head immediately. 

She says: 'I would be dubious to let my guard down emotionally because I would wonder if he was coming after me for what I had. 

'My natural instincts would come up and I wouldn't allow myself to fall for them.

'Because although that person could be ticking all of my boxes, and I could tick all of his, that fear of someone coming into my lifestyle, not because they want me, but because of what I have and all of the trappings that come with that, would automatically make me press the eject button.'

Ampika's lifestyle definitely has trappings. 

She regularly attends champagne-fuelled, red carpet parties in Cheshire and also frequents A-List bashes held by the likes of Elton John. 

She still lives in a house that costs upwards of £1million and owns 45 pieces of diamond jewelry.

Even the other Housewives are impressed with the size of her walk-in wardrobe at home. 

She admits: 'My wardrobe is like the Harrods clearance sale - everything is crammed on every rail and there are handbags shoved everywhere.'

It is this millionaire lifestyle that makes the leggy brunette convinced that their television show will become bigger than both The Only Way Is Essex and Made In Chelsea. 

She says: 'I look at it on a different level to Towie.

'I think that because we're a lot older than the people in Towie, our lives are a lot more interesting and varied.

'They've got to a certain point where there's only so much that you can do, whereas most of us have been there, done that, had the boyfriends, got married, bought the dream house - they've all got that still to come.

'We've done that and are on to the next chapter.

'So I think we've got huge scope.

'It has also got a few more bricks in each house and a few more bits of bling on each finger, so it ups it. 

'It makes it more appealing to the eye and everyone wants a slice.'

One person who certainly doesn't want a slice is Ampika's father Paul Fawcett, who is horrified at his daughter's decision to take part in a reality show. 

She says: 'My father is utterly disgusted. 

I don't have a close relationship with my mum, I've not seen her for years, so it's just my dad and he is utterly disgusted and ashamed of the fact that I'd want to put my life on display to the public and get hurled abuse at.

'So he might not want to watch it, but I'm sure I'll have lots of other followers.' 

And one thing she is keen to introduce her followers to is some outrageous Cheshire style. 

She says: 'Cheshire is chintzy and vibrant - big shoulder pads, big hair, lots of hairspray. 

'We're in your face.

'Down south they are a lot more reserved, a lot more classical and chicer. 

'They look at the formation of a silhouette as opposed to being embedded in crystals and heavily jeweled, which I tend to go for.'

But although she has a different style to most southerners, one woman she makes sure to single out for some praise is the Duchess of Cambridge. 

She says: 'I have got a lot of respect for Kate Middleton's style - I think that she is classically very beautiful.

'I like a lot of her choices, like the colours, the detail and the simplicity of everything - she looks like an elegant lady and I very proud that she represents our country as the Duchess of Cambridge.

'But, she would be even sexier if she went through my underwear wardrobe and got some sexy Agent Provocateur on and I tell you what Katie, you could conquer the world!'
