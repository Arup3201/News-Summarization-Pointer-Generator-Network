Sixteen Egyptian soldiers have died after suspected Islamist militants attacked a checkpoint on the Israeli-Egyptian border on Sunday evening.

The gunmen stole two of their vehicles before detonating one to blow a hole through a security fence into Israel, the country's chief military spokesman said today. 

Both Egypt and Israel blamed the bloody onslaught on extremists from the Hamas-run Gaza Strip and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.

The attack was the deadliest yet sustained by Egyptian troops, who have increasingly become targets of militants along the desert border.

The Israeli intelligence services claim they were able to thwart the assault after receiving advance reports of an impending attack from the Sinai Peninsula.

However, the incident has raised fresh fears in Israel about the Egyptian government's ability to reassert control over the lawless Sinai region.

The border had been largely quiet in the three decades since Israel and Egypt signed a peace agreement, but Sinai turned increasingly chaotic after Egypt's longtime President Hosni Mubarak was toppled last year.

Militants have taken advantage of the security vacuum that followed Mubarak's ousting and have attacked Israel from the desert peninsula three times over the past year, including a cross-border assault that killed eight people last August.

Israel contends that Al Qaeda operatives have infiltrated the area, as well as Palestinian militants who have crossed over from Gaza. The country is building a fence along the border with Egypt to avert attacks and block the entry of illegal African migrants.

Egypt's new President Mohammed Morsi accused the militants of 'treason' and said they would 'pay dearly' for Sunday's attack, which the Israeli military said was part of a plot to abduct an Israeli soldier.

Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak demanded that Egypt do more to enforce security and prevent attacks from Sinai.

'We hope this will be a fitting wakeup call for the Egyptians to take things in hand on their side more forcefully,' he told the Israeli parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee today.

Israeli military spokesman Brig.-Gen. Yoav Mordechai told Army Radio that the militants attacked the Egyptian troops at a border checkpoint, seized a truck and an armoured car, then blew up one of the vehicles to punch a hole through a security fence to enter Israel.

He said Israeli intelligence services had received information about an impending infiltration and sent aircraft to strike at the second car the militants seized from the Egyptian forces.

'We were prepared for it, so there was a hit,' he said.

Barak said eight militants were killed by Israeli forces who struck from the air, as well as with tanks and artillery. The gunmen were armed with explosive devices, submachine guns and grenades, said Mordechai, who claimed the military 'averted a major attack on southern Israel.'

There were no casualties among Israeli civilians. People living in the immediate area were ordered to remain in their homes while troops searched for other militants who might have remained behind, but were told this morning that they could resume their routines.

An Egyptian military official said last night that Egyptian troops were pursuing militants who returned to Egypt.

Egypt-Israel relations have always been cool, but since Mubarak was overthrown and Islamist parties moved to the forefront of the Egyptian political scene, Israeli officials have expressed concern that ties would deterioriate further. 

Sunday's attack took place around sunset near the Egyptian border town of Rafah, when the troops at the checkpoint were having the traditional meal at the end of the daily fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

Immediately afterwards, Egypt shut the Rafah crossing with Gaza, an ominous sign for the Palestinian territory's 1.6 million people.

Israel, fearing militant attacks, bars Gazans from entering Israel, so the Rafah crossing - the only passage from Gaza that is not under direct Israeli control - is their only gateway to the outside world.

Gaza's deputy prime minister, Mohammed Awad of the ruling Hamas movement, said militants from the territory were 'not involved in this awful crime.'

But a leading Hamas member, Mohammed Zahar, undercut that denial, telling Al-Jazeera TV that he had asked Egypt to provide the names of possible suspects from Gaza so that 'we will immediately bring them to justice.'

The attack could harm Hamas's efforts to persuade Morsi to ease restrictions at the crossing. Hamas is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood and had hoped that Morsi, a fellow member of the region-wide movement, would be sympathetic to its requests. But he has moved cautiously, in part because of concerns about an influx of militants from Gaza.

A senior Hamas official in Gaza confirmed that Muslim extremists with links to global jihadist groups are present in Gaza. Their numbers are small and they are tightly controlled by Hamas security, the official claimed, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue with reporters. 

Morsi convened an emergency meeting with military and security leaders following the attack, and in an interview afterward with Egyptian state TV, declared that 'this treason, this aggression and criminality cannot be appeased. Troops will totally control Sinai.'

In a statement late last night, Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood urged Egyptian authorities to take all necessary measures to 'confront this serious challenge to Egyptian sovereignty and to protect Sinai from all armed groups.'

Since Mubarak stepped down, Israel has allowed Egypt to send in more troops to Sinai, which has been mostly demilitarized according to the 1979 peace deal between the two countries.

Sunday's attack sparked renewed calls in Egypt to amend the treaty to allow for more troops in Sinai.
