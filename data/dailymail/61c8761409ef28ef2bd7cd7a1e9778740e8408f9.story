Gareth Bale has been left out of Real Madrid's squad for Wednesday's Champions League clash against Liverpool as the Wales international battles a muscle injury.

Bale was unlikely to feature at Anfield after Madrid announced on Monday that the forward was suffering from a gluteal  (buttock) injury, and on Tuesday the world's most expensive player was a confirmed absentee from Carlo Ancelotti's 20-man squad for the trip to Anfield.

Gareth Bale will miss Real Madrid's clash with Liverpool due to a gluteal injury

Bale is also a doubt for Real's clash with Barcelona on Saturday 

The 25-year-old was an unused substitute in Saturday's La Liga win over Levante on his return from international duty, having played the full 90 minutes in both of Wales' Euro 2016 qualifiers against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus.

Reports in Spain suggest that Bale is also set to miss this weekend's Clasico showdown against Barcelona at the Bernabeu, as well as the possibility of further matches.

Madrid, the reigning European champions, will be defending their 100 per cent record in Champions League Group B at Liverpool, who have won one and lost one so far.
