Atletico Madrid players posed for an impromptu team photo as they boarded their plane to Cologne ahead of their Champions League last 16 tie with Bayer Leverkusen, that striker Mario Mandzukic soon uploaded to his official Instagram account. 

The players pictured with Mandzukic  are defender Diego Godin forwards Antoine Griezmann and Fernando Torres midfielders Miranda and Mario Suarez and goalkeeper Jan Oblak. 

Los Rojiblancos travel to the game after getting back to wining ways in La Liga on Saturday with a comfortable 3-0 win over Almeria, a result that sees them sit third in the table with 53 points after 24 games, seven behind the pace of Real Madrid who are top.

Leverkusen, meanwhile, are sixth in the Bundesliga and are currently suffering a blip in their form. They have drawn one and lost two of their last three games.   

In Mandzukic and Griezmann, Atletico boast two of Europe's most in-from forwards, with the latter behind only Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Tottenham's Harry Kane for league goals in 2015. 

Diego Simeone's men reached the final of the Champions League last year before losing out to city rivals Real in the final 4-1.
