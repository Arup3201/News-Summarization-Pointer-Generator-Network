A probable cause document filed in Elkhart Superior Court reveals that the Spanish teacher admitted she had 'made out' with the student.

The document says she and the student had 'two dates that included kissing, fondling and other touching in an intimate manner while at locations in Elkhart County during April and May in 2013.'

According to the Goshen News the student reported the inappropriate relationship to Wa-Nee School Corporation officials in September 2013.

Wilson was suspended on September 25th and fired from her job at Northwood High School on October 14.

According to the affidavit, Wilson was interviewed by police and admitted that she had gone on a date and that she and the male student had 'made out'.

The teacher's husband Brant Wilson is an assistant football coach at Goshen High School.

Wilson had taught at the school since 2012 with her teaching licence valid until the end of 2014.

Joe Sabo, superintendent of Wa-Nee Schools, said: 'From the beginning, our focus is the best interests of our students.

'We believe that our course of action was fair, reasonable, and appropriate.'

Wilson was charged with child seduction, a class D felony. She was arrested at her home and held on $5,000 bond.

She faces up to three years in jail if convicted with a fine of $10,000.
