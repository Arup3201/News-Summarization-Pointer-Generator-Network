Enjoyed by millions of consumers worldwide every day, many of our favourite food and drinks claim to be steeped in a tradition that saw generations before us savoring the same unmistakable tastes.

Coca Cola claims to use the same secret recipe as it did when the fizzy drink was first created some 127 years ago and fast food chain KFC says it sticks to Colonel Harland Sanders' original 1940 method for frying chicken.

But are the most famous brands in our cupboards really true to their roots?

The Real Thing? Coca-Cola's 127-year-old recipe, which manufacturers claim is still used today, sits in this overstated secure vault at the World of Coca-Cola museum, in Atlanta

Arguably the most famous soft drinks brand in the world, Coca Cola says that its flagship drink uses the same secret formula as creator Dr John S Pemberton in 1886.

It even goes as far as keeping the original formula in a high security vault at its Atlanta World of Coca-Cola museum - perhaps a sales gimmick argue some.

But a 1994 book called Secret Formula claimed that there have been a variety of changes to the Coke recipe over the generations and even claimed that it once contained cocaine in trace amounts, derived in the coca plants used to make the product - a claim that Coca-Cola has since dismissed as untrue.

Similarly, PepsiCo also celebrates the roots of its flagship drink Pepsi-Cola invented by Caleb Bradham and introduced as Brad's drink in 1893.

But the drink was made sweeter in the 1930s when a new owner bought the firm and didn't like the taste and both Coca-Cola and Pepsi switched from sugar to high-fructose corn syrup in the 1980s.

It was widely reported last year that both firms changed their U.S recipes to avoid having to put a cancer warning on the label.

But a Coca-Cola spokesman told MailOnline at the time that rather than altering the recipe, the firm was merely changing the way it makes one of its ingredients to reduce the amount of 4-MEI in the caramel.

In fact when Coca-Cola tried to make the drink slightly sweeter in 1985 and relaunched it as 'New Coke' in the US there was a public outcry.

Less than three months later the company announced it was reverting back to the original recipe.

Its origins are also a big part of the way fast food chain KFC markets its fried chicken with inventor Colonel Sanders still featuring in cartoon form on the brand's signs.

According to Yahoo News, the Colonel even dyed his beard white to achieve a more grandfatherly look in the early days.

In a similar move to Coca-Cola, KFC also gave security surrounding the original formula an upgrade by installing a 770-pond safe to guard it.

Although the recipe might still be the same as Colonel Sanders', the production method is said to have changed.

The founder is said to have been unhappy with the way chicken was handled after new owners bought him out in 1964.

His friend Dave Thomas, founder of the Wendy's chain, said that he was angry that the new owners drained grease off chicken by putting it on wire racks rather than spooning it off by hand.

But KFC say that the integral parts of the recipe - using fresh on the bone chicken, hand breading, frying under pressure and the recipe for the seasoning itself - remain exactly the same.

Even new introductions to the chain's popular menu which include filleted chicken use the same seasoning, say the chain.

When popular U.S snack Twinkies parent company ran into financial trouble in recent years the product was removed from the shelves.

But the snack is back - albeit with a different recipe to that which millions of Americans enjoyed since its 1930 launch.

Hostess, which makes the product, said that the primary three ingredients remain the same, but the product has a noticeably longer shelf life and more ingredients listed on the packaging.

It remains to be seen whether sticking to the original recipe really is a winning formula or whether a change will do Twinkies good.

Classic: Coca-Cola

The exact recipe of Coca-Cola has always been a mystery and today's official recipe is guarded 24-hours a day in a vault in Atlanta.

The list of ingredients below are meant to be those used by pharmacist John Pemberton, who created the drink in 1886.
