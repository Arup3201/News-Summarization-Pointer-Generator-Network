Nicola Ann 'Nicky' Morgan completed her rapid rise to the Cabinet this morning, replacing Michael Gove as Education Secretary just four years after entering Parliament.

The  41-year-old mother of one became an MP in 2010 - representing Loughborough in the East Midlands - and has risen rapidly despite sparking controversy over her outspoken opposition to gay marriage.

She began her government career as a junior whip before becoming a Treasury minister in October last year. David Cameron also handed her the job of women's minister, attending Cabinet - a position she will keep as Education Secretary.

Nick Morgan has backed every education reform introduced by Michael Gove and is an ally of the Chancellor George Osborne

The new Education Secretary Nicky Morgan arrived in Downing Street today. The high-flying mother of one only entered Parliament in 2010

Mrs Morgan is a trustee of the Conservative Christian Fellowship and voted against same-sex marriage because of her faith.

This is widely seen as the the reason Mr Cameron split the women and equalities brief last year - leading to accusations that she was the 'minister for straight women'.

Mr Cameron today handed the equalities brief back to Mrs Morgan - but has asked the new junior education minister Nick Boles to look after gay marriage.

Mrs Morgan voted against gay marriage in 2013 claiming it should be between 'a man and a woman’.

She said: 'This is a very big social change. There have been plenty of little changes down the years but what’s never been changed is that the fact that marriage is between a man and a woman.

'I think that was one of the issues people, especially those who asked me to vote against, found hardest to accept and it also tied in with my own Christian faith too.

'I totally support civil partnerships and that same-sex relationships are recognised in law. But marriage, to me, is between a man and a woman.'

Teachers' unions were delighted that Mr Cameron had sacked Michael Gove as Education Secretary - but Mrs Morgan is unlikely to water down any of his reforms

Teachers' unions were today celebrating Mrs Morgan's appointment as Education Secretary - but may be left disappointed if her voting record is anything to go by.

She has strongly backed every single education reform pushed through by Mr Gove - backing free schools, academies and tuition fee increases.

Mrs Morgan has also never attended state school herself - attending the exclusive £4,701-a-year Surbiton High School in south west London.

Mrs Morgan went on to study law at Oxford before becoming a high flying city lawyer in 1996.

Following the announcement, Mrs Morgan said she was delighted with her new role and pledged to work alongside parents, teachers and schools as Michael Gove's departure from the post was welcomed by unions.

In her first statement, Ms Morgan said that education can be 'the single greatest transformer of lives' and was a crucial part of the Government's plans.

'I am delighted to become Education Secretary and continue as minister for women and equalities,' she said.

'I know that education can be the single greatest transformer of lives. It is also a crucial part of this Government's long-term plan.

'I look forward immensely to working alongside parents, teachers and schools to ensure we have world class schools and the skills that will get our young people great jobs.'
