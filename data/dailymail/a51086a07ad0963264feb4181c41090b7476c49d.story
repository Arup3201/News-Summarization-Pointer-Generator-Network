A photograph of a uniformed policeman apparently fast asleep on the job has been posted on Facebook.

Police chiefs in Greater Manchester have launched an investigation after the embarrassing picture was spotted on the site.

It shows the Salford-based PC, 26, slumped on a sofa in full uniform with his eyes closed. It is understood to have been taken following an incident which saw officers called out in the city.

The caption on the picture names the PC, with 'expert scene management' inserted as his middle name.

Underneath the photograph, a colleague left a comment which read: 'The picture doesn’t quite capture the snoring'.

Greater Manchester Police's professional standards branch is making enquiries into the incident.

The slumbering Salford officer can be seen on a black leather sofa, surrounded by sheets of paper and a Primark shopping bag.

The name of the officer has not been disclosed due to fears of reprisals.

The photograph, which is believed to have been taken several weeks ago, had been seen by 29 people before it was removed from Facebook when GMP were alerted to its presence on the site.

The officer’s Facebook page has also since been taken down.

A force spokesman said: 'Greater Manchester Police’s Professional Standards Branch is making enquiries to establish the full circumstances relating to when and where this photograph was taken.

'These enquiries are ongoing.'

Ian Hanson, chairman of GMP Federation, said: 'Whilst obviously it would not be appropriate to comment on this particular incident as it is under internal investigation, I would make the point that what is portrayed briefly in a picture is not necessarily the full story.'

The image has come to light almost exactly one year after a photo was published of two GMP specialist armed officers fooling around with a shotgun on the bonnet of a Land Rover Defender armoured vehicle.

Following an inquiry by GMP’s Professional Standards branch, the officers and the weapons instructor who took the image were moved out of the Tactical Firearms Unit and on to other divisions.

The internal investigation was launched after the picture was found on a computer during an unrelated raid on another officer’s home.
