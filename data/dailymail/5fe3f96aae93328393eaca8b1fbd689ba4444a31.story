Australia's
Immigration Minister has come out fighting against claims that the navy was
responsible for burning the hands of asylum seekers who said they were forced
to hold on to parts of a hot boat engine.

Minister Scott Morrison said he
would not tolerate the Australian navy being subjected to 'sledging' after
claims by Indonesian police that asylum seekers sent away from Australian
shores suffered burns.

According to the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation, quoting Indonesian police sources, 10 asylum seekers
had to receive treatment after being escorted away from Australian waters -
seven of whom had 'severe burns' on their hands.

The ABC said it had obtained vision
of the asylum seekers being medically assessed for burns from the hot engine
after they were returned to Indonesia.

The burns claims, supported by
pictures of the hands of at least one asylum seeker, follows allegations by the
refugees two weeks ago that they were badly treated by the Australian navy.

Now, according to the ABC, boat
passenger Merke Abdullah Ahmed, from Somalia, claimed that Australian navy
personnel punched some passengers and others were forced to hold onto the hot
metal.

'They physically harmed us,' the
broadcaster reported him as saying. 'Some of the passengers on board, they
tried to complain and speak about just their problems.

'They (navy personnel) just
punched...and you, know, fall down on the ground'

With relations between Australian
and Indonesia already strained after it was revealed that Australian naval
vessels had entered Indonesian waters on more than one occasion, Mr Morrison
said today that the injury claims were unsubstantiated.

'The Australian Government is not
going to put up with people sledging the Australian navy with unsubstantiated
claims,' he said.

He added that people smugglers and
their clients 'have strong motivations for seeking to discredit the activities
of Australia's border protection operations in an attempt to undermine public
support for the Government's strong border policies.

'There has been no police
investigation in Indonesia. There has been nothing of that sort.'

Acting Liberal Prime Minister Warren
Truss said later today that he was confident Defence Force personnel had acted
responsibly.

'I regret the fact that some asylum
seekers seem to have been injured, but who knows under what circumstances that
injury happened,' he told the ABC.

The Indonesian government has not
yet announced whether it has accepted Australia's apology for its naval vessels
entering Indonesian waters without permisison, but it has sent four of its own
ships to patrol its sea borders to the south.

A former Indonesian general who is
now a member of Indonesia's foreign affairs commission has rejected claims by
Australia that its ships had not intended entering Indonesian waters.

Tubagus Hasanuddin said he had
studied at the military academy in Australia and he doubted the navy had
strayed into Indonesian waters unintentionally.

'The Australian navy doesn't have
wooden boats. They have warships equipped with modern technology,' he said.
'They should have known which part of the water is Indonesia and which is not.'

Mr Tubagus warned that if Australia
kept forcing asylum seeker boats back into Indonesian waters, it risked meeting
the Indonesian navy head to head on the high seas.
