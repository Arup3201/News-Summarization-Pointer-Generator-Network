A police crackdown on burglary in the Northeast has resulted in more than 400 arrests and sentences totalling 100 years being handed down.

Northumbria Police launched Operation Soundwave in July last year in a bid to tackle opportunist crime.

The measures have had some success with burglaries in Newcastle down 4 per cent on the same period last year.

Partners in crime: Sarah Bunting and Kirk Watson broke into a nightclub intending to steal alcohol but were caught in the venue's loading bay. Watson had been sentenced for breaking into another club last year

Among those now behind bars are Sarah Bunting, 30, and Kirk Watson, 29, both of Howe Street, Gateshead. On January 7, they broke into Digital nightclub in Times Square via a rear door and stole spirits, liqueurs and beer with a value totalling more than £1,500.

The incompetent thieves were quickly apprehended in the club’s service area. Pleading guilty to burglary at Newcastle Magistrates’ Court two days later, they were both sentenced to 44 weeks’ imprisonment.

Watson had not long been out of jail after being sentenced for stealing spirits from Beyond Bar, in the Gate, in Newcastle city centre on April 17. He was jailed for four months to run consecutively, as a previous suspended sentence was activated, resulting in an eight-month prison sentence in total.

Salvatore Musumeci, of Trentham Avenue in Newcastle, was jailed for 12 months on December 11, 2013 for various burglaries

Former waiter Salvatore Musumeci of Trentham Avenue, Byker, Newcastle, was jailed for 12 months on December 11, 2013 after pleading guilty to a burglary a month earlier and three other similar offences.

Musumeci, 44, told police that he became a heroin addict after losing his job at Francesca’s, in Jesmond.

He was caught after taxi driver Kenneth Davidson saw Debra Dunthorne in distress when she found a burglar in her home in Benton, Newcastle.

Mr Davidson rang the police on his mobile and then chased after the man, giving a running commentary on his phone.

When he caught up with Musumeci, Mr Davidson sat on him until police arrived to make an arrest.

Judge Guy Whitburn QC, at Newcastle Crown Court, said: “I award Mr Davidson £200 out of the public purse for his public-spirited actions in helping Miss Dunthorne and in restraining the defendant until the police arrived.”

Newcastle Chief Inspector David Felton said: ‘Since last July dozens of people have been put behind bars, receiving sentences totalling 100 years.

‘That’s a significant amount of time and every time we put a burglar before the courts and they get jailed, it makes Newcastle a safer place for law-abiding residents.

‘We’re well aware the impact burglary has on residents and communities and that’s why we continue to focus on tackling those bringing misery to our communities.

‘I hope the fact these offenders are spending 100 years behind bars reassures people we take it extremely seriously. Burglars can be sure there will be no let-up – efforts are continuing to target suspects to prevent offences from taking place.’

Northumbria’s Police and Crime Commissioner, Vera Baird added: ‘This operation shows the terrific commitment Northumbria Police has to tackling house burglaries and reducing crime.’
