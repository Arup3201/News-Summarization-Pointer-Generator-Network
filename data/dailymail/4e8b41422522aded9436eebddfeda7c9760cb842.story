With her shiny body and smooth curves, this £15-million superyacht is a real wealth symbol.

The Adastra, unveiled today in China, is the new floating pleasure palace of billionaire businessman Anto Marden who commissioned its construction five years ago.

Designed by Sussex-based yacht designer John Shuttleworth, the Adastra is so high-tech, it can even be cotrolled remotely at the touch of an iPad... as long as you don't get any further away than 50 metres.

Space age: The trimaran yacht Adastra certainly made an impact during its launching ceremony yesterday in China

Marden, who is based in Hong Kong and 
made his fortune in the shipping industry, will be able to sail the 
state-of-the-art boat between the two islands he already owns off the 
coast of Indonesia.

Described as ‘one of the world's most amazing super yachts’, Adastra is 42.5 metres long, 16 metres wide and weighs 52
tons.

‘It takes the power trimaran concept further than has ever been 
attempted before,’ Mr Shuttleworth told Boat International.

Owner: Anto Marden, who is based in Hong Kong, made his fortune in the shipping industry

‘The challenge of turning this 
concept into a viable luxury yacht has taken us to further research and 
to develop new thinking on stability and comfort at sea for this type of
 craft.’

It is the result of five years of planning and construction, and rivals anything owned by yacht-lover Roman Abramovich.

The hull of the Adastra is built from glass and Kevlar and can house nine guests and six crewmen. The deck saloon has a panoramic view while the open cockpit has sofas on both sides. The open deck running aft also
has a door that hinges 
out to create a bathing platform.

Maximum speed reached by the yacht is 22.5 knots and her
range is an astonishing 4000 nautical miles at 17 knots. That is enough for a trip from the UK to New York.

Boat International magazine said Adastra 'could spell the future for efficient long range cruising'.

The yacht has an integrated ship monitoring system, and
can even be controlled with an Apple iPad within a 50-metre range.

Adastra is powered by one Caterpillar C18 engine of 1150hp
at 2300 rpm and has 2 Yanmar 110hp @ 3200 rpm outrigger engines.

Adastra's 16-metre beam features a saloon area on the main
deck with a lounge area, dining table, and navigation station.

The deck at the rear of the yacht has a sofa and bar area to
port and a dining area to starboard.

The main helm station, which has seating for two, is
positioned in a raised pilot house situated between the rear deck and the saloon
area and forms part of the cross beam structure.

The Adastra is the latest in a long line of super yachts that compete to be the most high tech.

Last year Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich bought a £300 million superyacht with two swimming pools, two helipads, a gym, hair salon, dancefloor and submarine.

Eclipse has plenty of room to entertain friends, 
with 15 double bedroom cabins all equipped with their own luxury 
bathrooms and 6ft wide television screens. Parties on the 533ft yacht 
are guaranteed to stay private, as it’s fitted with an ‘anti-paparazzi 
shield’ that fires a laser beam of light at cameras to ruin photographs.

The 20,000 sq ft interior also houses a sauna, steam bath and whirlpool to help guests wind down.

The superyacht is 42.5 meters in length, 16 metres in width and weighs 52 tons

The Adastra was built in Zhuhai, China for a couple based in Hong Kong, at the cost of a cool $15 million

Five years in the planning and construction phase, the Adastra has finally taken to the water, much to the delight of boating enthusiasts

The superyacht has space for nine passengers and 5-6 crew, and can travel 4,000 miles without refueling
