Italian football fans are known for their passion and fierce loyalty to their local teams.

But one supporter appears to have taken the beautiful game a little too seriously.

Arturo Verratti's five-year-old son has reported him to police for trying to force him to support Juventus football team.

The 38-year-old even called in a the local priest, Don Cesare, to exorcise the devil from his son who had committed the cardinal sin of supporting hated rival team Milan.

His father feared that only Satan could have been to blame for persuading his son to pledge allegiance to any team other than his beloved Juventus.

In an extraordinary attempt to change his son's mind, his father dreamed up a few techniques to break his spirits.

The
 boy told police he was being forced to sing Juventus' chants and wear 
their black and white jersey day and night to indoctrinate him into 
being a supporter.

Neighbours confirmed they have often heard the boy loudly singing Juventus chants under the urging of his dad.
