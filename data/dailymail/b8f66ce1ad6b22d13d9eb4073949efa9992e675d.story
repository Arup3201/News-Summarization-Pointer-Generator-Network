NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden did a sit down with American mainstream media for the first time last week and a clip is now online.

In the interview set to air on Wednesday night, NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams speaks to the former NSA contractor who leaked classified information about the U.S.'s surveillance a year ago.

Mr Williams travelled to Moscow, Russia, where Mr Snowden holds temporary asylum since last year, and spent several hours quizzing him.

Back in the limelight: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden will appear in his first interview with mainstream American TV this week

The exclusive interview, to be aired as an hour-long NBC special, is the latest media appearance by Mr Snowden, following a videolink speech at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival, a TED Conference in March and an interview in Vanity Fair's May issue.

Also appearing on the NBC special is Glenn Greenwald, the Pulitzer prize winning journalist who broke the NSA surveillance story in the Guardian.

Snowden’s interview comes after the House moved the U.S. closer to ending theNSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records last Thursday.

It is the most significant demonstration to date of Snowden's impact on the debate over privacy versus security.

But the final version of the legislation, ‘watered down’ in the words of one supporter, also showed the limits of that impact.

The bill was severely weakened to mollify U.S. intelligence agencies, which insisted that the surveillance programs that shocked many Americans are a critical bulwark against terror plots.

The bill was approved 303-121, which means that most House members can now say they voted to end what many critics consider the most troubling practice Snowden disclosed — the collection and storage of U.S. calling data by the secretive intelligence agency.

But almost no other major provision designed to restrict NSA surveillance, including limits on the secret court that grants warrants to search the data, survived the negotiations to get the bill to the House floor.

And even the prohibition on bulk collection of Americans' communications records has been called into question by some activists who say a last-minute change in wording diminished what was sold as a ban.

‘People will say, “We did something, and isn't something enough”,‘ said Steven Aftergood, who tracks intelligence issues for the Federation of American Scientists. ‘But this bill doesn't fundamentally resolve the uncertainties that generated the whole controversy.’

Though some privacy activists continued to back the bill, others withdrew support, as did technology companies such as Google and Facebook.
