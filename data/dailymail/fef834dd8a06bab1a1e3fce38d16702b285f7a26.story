Warning: Labour leader Ed Miliband last week raised doubts that safeguards could work to prevent arms falling into the hands of extremist groups

Ed Miliband has been invited to a secret security meeting today in an apparent attempt to persuade him to soften his opposition to arming Syrian rebels.

The Labour leader will be briefed by spy chiefs and military top brass at the Government’s National Security Council (NSC), which is chaired by David Cameron.

The pair have clashed over the idea of sending weapons to help end the civil war and Mr Miliband is expected to repeat concerns that arms could find their way to extremists, while backing moves for a peace conference.

Labour sources denied his hands would be ‘dipped in blood’ by accepting the invitation and suggested the meeting was routine.

Downing Street also played down his role, saying it ‘makes sense’ for opposition leaders to discuss foreign policy issues.

Mr Miliband attended an NSC meeting just once before – during the Libyan crisis in 2011.

It comes after Mr Miliband warned the Prime Minister he must ‘build the greatest possible consensus’ across political parties before intervening in Syria.

The NSC is chaired by the Prime Minister to oversee all aspects of Britain’s security.

The head of the armed forces and the intelligence agencies attend to brief ministers on the biggest threats at home and overseas.

Permanent members include Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Chancellor George Osborne, Foreign Secretary William Hague and Home Secretary Theresa May.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, International Development Secretary Justine Greening and security minister James Brokenshire are also expected to attend.

Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said Mr Miliband would be expected to ‘contribute fully’ to the talks.

‘They will be talking about a number of issues including Afghanistan, Iran and Syria.

‘It makes sense to discuss major issues of foreign policy and that’s what is happening tomorrow.’

However, the policy differences are most stark over the issue of Syria.

Mr Miliband has accused the Prime 
Minister of spending too much ‘political capital and energy’ on lifting 
the EU arms embargo to supply weapons to the rebels, without securing a 
major breakthrough at last week’s G8 summit.

There
are growing fears that any move by Britain to arm opposition forces 
could see weapons falling into the hands of extremist groups with links 
to Al Qaeda.

The Labour leader has questioned what safeguards the government believes could work in practice to stop this happening.

In the Commons last week Mr Miliband 
urged Mr Cameron ‘to proceed with the greatest possible clarity on his 
strategy and purpose and to seek to build the greatest possible 
consensus across this House’.

The Prime Minister appeared to signal a change in approach, and suggested he wanted to reach cross-party agreement.

‘I appreciate the fact that [Mr Miliband] has tried to provide consensus on issues of foreign policy - we should always try to do that, and I hope we can re-forge that consensus in the months ahead.’

But he defended the decision to push for the lifting of the EU arms embargo.

‘ It sent a powerful signal that there is not a moral equivalence between Assad on the one hand and the official opposition, who want a democratic Syria, on the other.

‘That has helped to add to the pressure. There is a huge danger that people will fall into the trap of believing Assad’s argument, which is that the only alternative to him is terrorism and extremism.

‘We should stand for something else in the House and in this country - we should stand up for people who want democracy, freedom and the sorts of things we take for granted right here.’
