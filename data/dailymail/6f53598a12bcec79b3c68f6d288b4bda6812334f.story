A British mother who is accused of kidnapping her four-year-old son for a year after Dubai court handed custody to her ex-husband has claimed she went on the run because he threatened to kill her.

Afsana Lachaux, 46, from London, is facing charges of kidnapping in the United Arab Emirates this week after taking her son when custody was awarded to her French ex-husband by a Dubai court.

Mrs Lachaux, was a senior 
civil servant in east London before moving to the UAE in 2010.

She claims she has been living in poverty 'trapped' in the country since the authorities took away her passport following a travel ban obtained by her ex-husband.

Mrs Lachaux alleges that her wealthy ex-husband has exploited Dubai’s legal system, based in part on Islamic sharia law, to gain custody of the little boy and have criminal charges brought against her.

She is now facing 
trial for allegedly abducting her son in March 2012, when she failed to 
take him to a court-ordered access meeting in a park with her former 
partner, a 38-year-old aviation engineer.

She strongly denies the charge and told a court this week: 'I did not kidnap my son. But after one of our court hearings, my ex-husband threatened to kill me if I didn’t give him the boy so I got scared and stayed away from him.'

In a letter submitted to prosecutors on February 18 last year her ex-husband wrote:  'She would forget his vaccinations, prevent the father from providing him with medical care, since he suffers eczema, and leaves the boy with strangers during her repeated travels and staying up late at parties with her friends.'

Mrs Lachaux has been told she must produce three witnesses who support her defence, that she did not turn up because she had allegedly suffered domestic abuse.

If she is found guilty at the next hearing on February 11, she could be imprisoned and deported.

She told the Telegraph: 'I just want to be reunited with my son and I want to come back home.

'I feel let down and abused by everyone and everything, and especially let down by the Foreign Office.'

One of her two adult sons in Britain, Rabbhi Yahiya, 26, is raising the profile of his mother's case at home.

Jim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, told the House of Commons Mrs Lachaux had moved to Dubai, but is 'now stranded there'

He wrote on a blog: 'On one occasion Afsana and her baby were flung into Bur Dubai jail where her baby was denied food and water and she was assaulted by a prison guard. Her incarceration was at the insistence of her husband. No investigation or action was taken into the false imprisonment or assault.'

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the arrest of a British national in Dubai in June 2011. We have been providing consular assistance to the family since that time and continue to do so.

'We cannot interfere in the judicial process of another country and must respect their systems just as we expect them to respect the UK’s laws and legal processes.'

In December Jim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, brought up Mrs Lachaux's situation in the House of Commons saying she was a friend of mine, who has been a constituent.'

He told the house she had moved to Dubai, but is 'now stranded there.'

'Sadly, although Afsana is a Muslim, because she is a woman in a Muslim country and because she is being reported by a man, even though he is French and, I believe, is not a Muslim, she has to explain and defend herself to each set of police officers who come to arrest her and, when she goes to report at police stations and is detained, she has to go through the elaborate process of explaining her circumstances all over again. She is not able to work and is surviving on what her family can send to her from London.

'To compound Afsana’s misery, she found out last month that her husband had divorced her and had successfully sued for custody of their child in a sharia court in Dubai more than 12 months ago. The rule in the UAE and under sharia law is that if 12 months have lapsed and the decision of the court has not been challenged, it is no longer appealable and is upheld. She was divorced and lost custody, but was not even aware of the fact.'
