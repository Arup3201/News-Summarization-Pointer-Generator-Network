A government scheme which helps first-time buyers to get onto the housing ladder buying homes for up to £600,000 may not ‘provide value for money’, a report warns today.

The National Audit Office, the spending watchdog, warns the cost to the taxpayer of the £3.7billion scheme is ‘uncertain at this stage but is likely to be significant.’

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, raised her fears yesterday why the maximum purchase price of a property under the scheme needs to be so high.

Under the first of the Government’s two Help to Buy scheme, you can buy a new-build home in England for up to £600,000.

The average price of a home in the UK is £175,000.

The buyer must put down a minimum deposit of five per cent, and the Government provides a loan for up to 20 per cent of the purchase price, which is interest-free for the first five years.

Mrs Hodge said: ‘You have to ask why the Department for Communities and Local Government thinks that providing loans to people who are buying homes worth £600,000 is actually benefitting those most in need.’

In Wales, the maximum purchase price is £300,000, and there have been calls for the maximum price in England to be lowered too.

Its report said there are significant question marks hanging over the scheme, such as whether people ‘would have bought a home anyway’ without a helping hand from the Government.

It states: ‘For these reasons, we cannot yet say whether the scheme will provide value for money.’The NAO also warns the DCLG ‘does not have a joined-up approach to evaluating the combined impact of its housing market initiatives.’

The warning comes as house prices are rising rapidly with prices reaching record levels in many parts of the country.

The average cost of a home in some parts of London is £1.2million.

For example, there is a second Help to Buy scheme, which is open to all types of homes, both old and new, and offers a Government guarantee on part of the buyer’s mortgage.

The NAO also questioned why Help to Buy agents had been paid £1,000 for each completed case that they had assessed at the beginning of the scheme.

The fee has been subsequently cut to £600, but an extra £600,000 was spent on fees during the first three months.

On average, people signing up to the Help to Buy scheme earn £44,700. That is, either their individual salary or the joint salary of a couple buying together.

This is only just higher than the average loan that they receive from the Government of £40,200 to help to buy the property.

The vast majority of people using the scheme are first-time buyers, equal to nearly nine in ten buyers.

It has been more popular in the North, than the South. More new homes were bought in the Midlands, the North East, Yorkshire and the Humber than in other regions.

Kris Hopkins, the housing minister, said the Help to Buy scheme offers ‘indisputable value for money’ and should generate £4.8billion over its lifetime.

During the first nine months of the scheme, which launch in April last year, nearly 13,000 families have bought a property.
