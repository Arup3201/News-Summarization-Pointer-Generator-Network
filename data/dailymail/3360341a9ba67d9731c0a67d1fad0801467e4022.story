A 15-year-old girl dragged another teenage by the hair and then bashed her and viciously kicked her in the face in an attack in a park which has been captured on video.

The attack happened in daylight last Saturday in a suburban park in Cranebrook, which is 60km west of Sydney's central business district. 

During the alleged attack, the girl, dressed in jeans and a top, attacks the 16-year-old girl among a stand of gum trees in the park near Penrith, in far western Sydney, Ray Hadley reports in an interview and an exclusive video to Radio 2GB.

Swift and vicious: This is the final, terrifying moment of the assault in which a 15-year-old schoolgirl brutally kicks in the face a girl, 16, from the same school in a beating which took place in a suburban park last Saturday in the far western Sydney suburb of Cranebrook

Headed for trouble: The 16-year-old girl (pictured wearing a dress) heads through the trees in the Cranebrook park followed by her assailant wearing a dark blue hoodie and lighter blue jeans moments before the confrontation

Suburban mayhem: The alleged bashing happened in daylight amid a stand of gum trees in a suburban park in Cranebrook (map, above), near Penrith in far western Sydney

About to happen: It''s seconds before the assault begins and the girl, 16, anticipating that it's about to get nasty pleads with someone to take her phone from her

Hands off: The 16-year-old holds up he hands as the younger girl marches in for the attack. The video is being filmed by a girl who is singing and then laughing her way through, while others watch on in 

 During the attack, filmed on a phone by a third girl who sings and laughs during the assault, the victim apparently anticipates the violence and repeatedly asks for someone to take her phone.

The pair clash, the victim holding up both hands in a defensive manner, then the 15-year-old assailant knees her and pulls her down by her long blonde hair and kicks her.

While the victim is lying on the ground, the younger girls delivers a direct and brutal kick in the face, and the victim emits a whimper.

Still upright: the pair wrestle for a few seconds, before it becomes terribly clear that the girl in blue is stronger

Losing battle: the slightly older girl is now clearly at the mercy of the girl, 15, who has her by the hair

Down she goes: The victim is kneed and punched to the ground by the 15-year-old assailant, who then grabs the girls long blonde hair and yanks on it as the girl is pushed down

Grounded: Helpless and hurting the 16-year-old has already been kicked once in this image, but the assailant takes a few steps back before she runs in to deliver the final blow

The girl filming the attack laughs as the victims remains on the ground.

The victim's aunt, Tania, told Ray Hadley her niece went to the same school as the 15-year-old. 

The girl who filmed the attack uploaded the video onto Facebook, after which the victim';s family reported the incident to police.

Schoolgirl beating: the weekend assault on the teenage girl occurred on October 11 in Cranebrook, whihc lies near the foothills of the Blue Mountains 60km west of Sydney's central business district

In pain: Whimpering from the vicious kick that has just been delivered to her face, the poor young teenager lies on the grass as the girl filming the appalling episode laughs
