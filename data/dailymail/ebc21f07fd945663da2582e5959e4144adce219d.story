Team Sky's Richie Porte and Geraint Thomas remain in contention for the week-long Paris-Nice title after Friday's fifth stage was won by Davide Cimolai (Lampre) in a bunch sprint.

Poland's Michal Kwiatkoswki (Etixx-QuickStep) retained the race leader's yellow jersey after the 192.5-kilometre stage from St Etienne to Rasteau.

But the world champion's advantage is sure to come under attack this weekend from Porte and Thomas, who are one and three seconds behind, respectively.

Welshman Thomas is likely to support the Australian's bid for overall victory.

Kwiatkoswki may need to gain some time in Saturday's lumpy sixth stage from Vence to Nice as Porte is expected to be strong in Sunday's concluding 9.5km time-trial up Col d'Eze.

Saturday's stage, which covers 184.5km from Vence to Nice is the big mountain challenge of the week-long race and features three Category 1 climbs.

It gives climbing specialist Porte the ideal opportunity to take the overall lead while Thomas, who is in third, three seconds behind the Pole will also benefit. 

Porte celebrates on the podium after winning the fourth stage, and he is now eyeing another overall win
