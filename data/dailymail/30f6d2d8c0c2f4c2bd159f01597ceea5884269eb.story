Texas Representative Steve Stockman introduced legislation today that would allow taxpayers to give the Internal Revenue Service the 'same 'lame' excuses for not for handing over documents as the IRS is giving Congress.

If the IRS is allowed to claim that 'convenient, unexplained, miscellaneous 
computer malfunction is sufficient justification not to produce 
specific, critical documentation,' Stockman's bill says, taxpayers should be able to, as well.

'Taxpayers shouldn’t be expected to follow laws the Obama administration refuses to follow themselves,' Stockman, a Republican, said in a statement announcing The Dog Ate My Tax Receipts Act.

'Taxpayers should be allowed to offer the same flimsy, obviously made-up excuses the Obama administration uses.'

The Congressman's tongue-in-cheek legislation is meant to tweak the IRS for claiming that it's unable to provide 28 months worth of emails from former Exempt Organizations Division Director Lois Lerner because her computer crashed in 2011.

Lerner left the IRS last year after she was implicated in a tea party targeting scheme in which the IRS inappropriately scrutinized right-leaning organizations applying for non-profit statuses while approving progressive groups' applications with little additional questioning.

At a May 2013 House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing Lerner testified that she had not broken any laws or regulations before invoking her Fifth Amendment right not to implicate herself in a crime.

Since then, Congress has been trying to get its hands on her emails, dating back to January 2009, so it could see if the IRS acted alone in the targeting or it was in cahoots with the White House.

IRS commissioner John Koskinen informed the House Ways and Means committee on Friday that getting the bulk of Lerner's emails for the first half of the time period in question would be more difficult than he'd originally led the committee to believe because of the computer crash.

During the crash her hard drive was damaged, Koskinen told Congress, and attempts to retrieve her data afterward were unsuccessful.

Koskinen told the Ways and Means commitee today that Lerner herself went to 'extraordinary' lengths to have technology experts at the IRS rebuild her hard drive so that she could access her old emails but they were 'unrecoverable.'

In keeping with its usual policy, the IRS recycled Lerner's hard drive in 2011, Koskinen said, so he cannot comply with an Oversight subpoena to turn the computer part over.

The computers of six other officials affiliated with the scandal also crashed, he told Congress on Monday, and the IRS is still working to recover their data.

'At this time it is too early to know whether any of the emails have been lost on any of those hard drives,' he testified today.

Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen told the House Ways and Means Committee on today that the IRS can't produce emails from seven officials connected to the tea party investigation because of computer crashes, including the emails from Lois Lerner

In response to Koskinen's shocking testimony this morning, Stockman, a Republican who is not running for re-election to his House seat and only has a few months left in his congressional term, filed The Dog Ate My Tax Receipts Act this afternoon.

In his bill Stockman says that 'fairness and Due Process demand that the American taxpayer be granted no less latitude than we afford the bureaucrats employed presently at the IRS.'

Unless the IRS produces the documents that were subpenaed, 'taxpayers shall be given the benefit of the doubt when not producing critical documentation' if their excuse is one of the following:1.         The dog ate my tax receipts2.         Convenient, unexplained, miscellaneous computer malfunction3.         Traded documents for five terrorists4.         Burned for warmth while lost in the Yukon5.         Left on table in Hillary’s Book Room6.         Received water damage in the trunk of Ted Kennedy’s car7.         Forgot in gun case sold to Mexican drug lords8.         Forced to recycle by municipal Green Czar9.         Was short on toilet paper while camping10.       At this point, what difference does it make?'In any case, IRS can see the NSA for a good, high quality copy,' Stockman snarkily stated at the end of the bill.
