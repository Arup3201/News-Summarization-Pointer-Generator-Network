A Berlin woman was reunited with her stolen dog on Sunday only to be told by vets that it had been gang raped.

Kessie, a three-year-old Bardino-Galgo mix, was stolen from outside an Edeka supermarket in the Neukölln area of Berlin while her owner was inside on Wednesday.

Vets believe that while missing, the pet was gang raped by the thieves, and received external and internal injuries.

Kessie's owner, who is known as Lena H, 30, discovered that her dog was missing when she left the store, and put up missing dog signs with her flatmate.

On Thursday she was phoned by an animal shelter in nearby Lichtenberg, to say that the pet was with them.

But they told her that Kessie had received injuries to her abdomen which were likely caused by a sexual assault.

The BZ Newspaper reported that when vets examined the dog they found that the injuries could not have been caused by 'herself or another dog'.

Vets also believe that more than one attacker may have been involved in the abduction and assault.

Lena has now reported the assault and theft to police.

She told the newspaper that Kessie is now in a better condition physically and is recovering well.

But she also said that the shock of the ordeal would take her and the pet a while to overcome
