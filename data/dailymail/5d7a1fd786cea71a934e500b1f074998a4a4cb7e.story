The Israeli delegation to the annual UN General Assembly rose from their seats and walked outÂ  today as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad began his speech by saying that the country had 'no roots' in the Middle East and would be 'eliminated'.

Flashing the peace sign on several occasions, Ahmadinejad refused to speak of the state of Israel by name and instead referred 
only to the 'Zionists'.

He told the UN conference in New York that Iran is unconcerned by Israeli threats of attack but prepared to defend itself.

Ahmadinejad also said that it was not too late for dialogue with the United States to resolve differences.

Meanwhile angry protests were taking place outside the Warwick Hotel at West 54th Street in Manhattan over its decision to allow Ahmadinejad to stay during his visit.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu has hinted Israel could strike Iran's nuclear sites and has 
criticized U.S. President Obama's position that sanctions and diplomacy 
should be given more time to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Iran denies that it is seeking nuclear arms and says its atomic work is peaceful, aimed at generating electricity.

'Fundamentally we do not take seriously the threats of the Zionists. ... We have all the defensive means at our disposal and we are ready to defend ourselves,' Ahmadinejad told reporters.

'While we are fully ready to defend ourselves, we do not take such threats seriously,' he said, speaking through an interpreter.

He also said that Iran is neutral in the Syrian civil war, and denied that Tehran is providing weapons or training to the government of President Bashar Assad.

Ahmadinejad said: 'We like and love both sides, and we see both sides as brothers.'

He referred to the conflict in Syria as 'tribal' fighting and said that international 'meddling from the outside has made the situation even harder'.

It was Ahmadinejad's eighth visit to the U.N. gathering held each September, which he cited as proof that he is open to understanding other countries' views.

In spite of his assertions on the 
importance of dialogue and respect for others, Ahmadinejad presented a 
hard line in many areas.

He
refused to speak of the state of Israel by name and instead referred 
only to the 'Zionists', and when asked about author Salman Rushdie he 
made no attempt to distance himself from recent renewed threats on the 
author's life emanating from an Iranian semi-official religious 
foundation.

He said: 'If he is in the U.S., you should not broadcast it for his own safety.'

Rushdie, an Indian-born British novelist 
who has nothing to do with the video, was condemned to death in 1989 by 
Khomeini, Iran's late leader, over his novel The Satanic Verses, saying 
its depiction of the Prophet Mohammad was blasphemous.

Ahmadinejad said this would be his 
last trip to New York as president of Iran, because his term is ending 
and he is barred from seeking a third consecutive term.

But he did not 
rule out staying active in Iranian politics and said he might return as 
part of future Iranian delegations to New York.

Ahmadinejad alluded to his previous 
rejection of Israel's right to exist. 'Iran has been around for the last
seven, 10 thousand years. They (the Israelis) have been occupying those
territories for the last 60 to 70 years, with the support and force of 
the Westerners. They have no roots there in history,' he said.

The modern state of Israel was founded in 1948.

'We
do believe that they have found themselves at a dead end and they are 
seeking new adventures in order to escape this dead end. Iran will not 
be damaged with foreign bombs,' Ahmadinejad said, referring to Israel.

'We
don't even count them as any part of any equation for Iran. During a 
historical phase, they represent minimal disturbances that come into the
picture and are then eliminated,' Ahmadinejad added.

In 2005, Ahmadinejad called Israel a 
'tumor' and echoed the words of the former Iranian Supreme Leader, 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, by saying that Israel should be wiped off 
the map.

Amir Ali 
Hajizadeh, a brigadier general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
Corps, was quoted on Sunday as saying that Iran could launch a 
pre-emptive strike on Israel if it was sure the Jewish state was 
preparing to attack it.

Hajizadeh said any attack on Iranian soil could trigger 'World War III'.

Ahmadinejad said the nuclear issue was one ultimately between the United States and Iran, and must be resolved with negotiations.

Syria grabbed the spotlight at the United Nations on Monday with a dire warning from international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi that the war is getting worse and threatening to spill across the Middle East.

However he also voiced a note of hope, saying he thinks there may be a way forward despite the deadlock in the UN Security Council.

Brahimi took over from Kofi Annan in September as the UN-Arab League special representative for Syria that he started to discuss with members 'the way forward'.

He said the situation is still stalemated and 'extremely difficult', with no prospect to move forward 'today or tomorrow'.

However he added: 'I refuse to believe that reasonable people do not see that you cannot go backward, that you cannot go back to the Syria of the past.'

The Security Council, the only U.N. body that can impose global sanctions and authorize military action, has been bitterly divided by Syria's crisis. Russia, Syria's key protector, and China have vetoed three Western-backed resolutions aimed at pressuring Assad to halt the violence and open talks with his opponents aimed at a transition of power.

Activists claim nearly 30,000 people have already died in the uprising, including in attacks on Monday by Syrian warplanes in the northern city of Aleppo.

'The nuclear issue is not a problem. But the approach of the United States on Iran is important. We are ready for dialogue, for a fundamental resolution of the problems, but under conditions that are based on fairness and mutual respect,' he said.

'We are not expecting a 33-year-old problem between the United States and Iran to be resolved in a speedy fashion. But there is no other way besides dialogue.'

Iran has held several rounds of talks this year on its nuclear issue with six world powers. The six are the permanent members of the UN Security Council - the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain - as well as Germany. The six powers are represented by EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.

Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Saeed
Jalili said last Wednesday that he and Ashton had agreed to defer more 
nuclear talks until the latter had consulted the six powers on the 
sidelines of the UN General Assembly this week.

On
Sunday UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon met Ahmadinejad and warned him 
of the dangers of incendiary rhetoric in the Middle East.

Ahmadinejad
is speaking at a high-level meeting on the rule of law at the United 
Nations on Monday and then will address the General Assembly on 
Wednesday.

In the past, 
Ahmadinejad has used his UN speeches to defend Iran's nuclear program 
and to attack Israel, the United States and Europe. He has questioned 
the Holocaust and cast doubt on whether 19 hijackers were really 
responsible for the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001.

Western envoys typically walk out of Ahmadinejad's speeches in protest.

There
will be high-level side meetings on Iran's nuclear program and the 
Syrian conflict during the General Assembly, but UN diplomats do not 
expect either issue to be resolved soon.

The United Nations and Western officials have accused Iran of supplying weapons to Syria's pro-government forces, while Syria's government has accused Qatar and Saudi Arabia of arming rebels determined to topple President Bashar al-Assad.

Ahmadinejad rejected the charge that Iran was sending arms to Syria.

'The so-called news that you alluded to has been denied vehemently, officially,' Ahmadinejad said in a response to a question. 'We seek peace in Syria.'

A UN Security Council panel of independent experts that monitors sanctions against Iran has uncovered several examples of Iran transferring arms to Syria. The United States and Britain say they are providing non-lethal assistance to Syria's rebels such as communications equipment, but not arms.

Ahmadinejad also addressed the issue of a California-made anti-Islam video, The Innocence of Muslims, that has sparked anti-American protests around the Muslim world.

He appeared to reject Washington's position that while it condemns the video's content, freedom of expression must be upheld.

'Freedoms must not interfere with the freedoms of others,' Ahmadinejad said. 'If someone insults, what would you do? ... Is insulting other people not a form of crime?'

Since the controversy over the video erupted this month, some Muslim leaders have reiterated calls for a UN measure outlawing insults to Islam and blasphemy in general.
