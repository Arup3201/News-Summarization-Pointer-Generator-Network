League One Bradford were 2-0 down in their fourth-round tie at Stamford Bridge after goals from Gary Cahill and Ramires for the Premier League leaders. However, a strike before half-time from Jon Stead followed by goals from Filipe Morais and Andy Halliday put the Bantams ahead before Mark Yeates confirmed their progress in injury time.

Mourinho admitted he was 'ashamed' and 'embarrassed' after the defeat, but the Portuguese was keen to congratulate the Bradford players after the match.

A dressing room visit from Mourinho was the icing on the cake for Bradford goalkeeper Ben Williams, who claimed the humility shown by Mourinho added to what was already an incredible day.

'It was fantastic. The scenes, the look on everyone's faces was amazing, something which will live long in the memory,' Williams told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme.

'The fans were amazing and after that Mourinho came into the dressing room and shook everyone's hand and congratulated us, that was a surreal moment as well.

'In he walked and the celebrations stopped. This figure waltzed into the dressing room. He was very classy, very humble, very respectful - it was the icing on the cake.'
