French president Francois Hollande is to use a pub lunch with David Cameron to pour scorn on Tory plans to claw powers back from Brussels.

The two men are expected to clash during the meeting in the Prime Minister's local, with Mr Hollande claiming Britain will have to wait ‘years’ before it is able to rewrite the terms of its membership of the European Union.

The row is likely to overshadow tomorrow's Anglo-French summit in Oxfordshire, which
 comes just days after the president split from his partner following an
 affair with an actress.

Awkward: Downing Street insisted there would be no role for spouses when David Cameron hosts French President Francois Hollande for a summit this week

Mr Cameron and Mr Hollande will appear side by side at the summit at RAF Brize Norton in the PM's constiuency
tomorrow morning before continuing their deliberations in a traditional English pub.

Mr Cameron and President Hollande will agree further defence 
co-operation on the development of new armed drones.

But ahead of the talks Mr Hollande’s spokesman said it was ‘very, very unlikely’ that any treaty changes will be in place before 2017, when Mr Cameron has pledged an in/out referendum on EU membership.

And he said all the talk of a referendum would frighten investors away from Britain.

In a briefing for journalists in Paris ahead of the summit, the President’s spokesman said any treaty change unlikely before 2017.

‘This doesn’t mean we won’t one day require treaties to be revised for the requirements of economic monetary union, but it is very, very unlikely this will be compatible with the British political calendar,’ he said.

‘It’s in our interests that Britain remains within Europe, but it is not by changing the treaties or rules will negotiate its place in the EU. It is in our interests that Britain remains within Europe but that cannot happen at the price of dismantling Europe.’

The official went on to warn that if the next Government agrees to a referendum, companies will be less willing to invest in the UK as the date for the vote approaches.

He said: ‘The more the question becomes concrete in British national debate, the more investors and the business community warn what a Britain out of Europe would mean.

‘When investors talk, they want to access the European market through the UK. This access presupposes following a certain number of rules to maintain balance in Europe.

‘If these rules are not wanted in the UK, it will no longer have access to [the European market].’

The French media said the Prime Minister would take the president to an Oxfordshire pub. To save his blushes, there will be a ‘no spouses’ programme – meaning Mr Cameron will not be accompanies by his wife Sam.

Pub diplomacy: Tony Blair sought to win over French President Jacques Chirac in 2000 with a pint in the County restaurant in the Labour PM's constituency in County Durham ahead of a summit in France

In 2003 Mr Blair repeated the trick, taking US President George W Bush to the Dun Cow pub in his constituency

Unlike the French presidency, Downing Street has refused to confirm or deny any reports about what will be discussed at the summit.

But French officials said the UK and France will deepen their co-operation on defence by developing a new generation of armed drones.

They will sign announce that defence companies from the two countries will carry out a two-year study on building armed drones for their countries’ military, French officials said yesterday.

The ‘entente frugale’ military agreement between France and the UK was first signed in 2010, as the two countries attempted to save money following the credit crunch depression.

Tomorrow, the two leaders will say they have gone further and will work together on developing a Predator-type drone.

At the summit at RAF Brize Norton, they will also announce greater cooperation on anti-ship missiles and underwater mine detectors.
