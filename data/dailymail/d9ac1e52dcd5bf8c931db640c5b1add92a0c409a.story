Footage has surfaced purporting to show a big cat wandering through a Paris carpark as French authorities continue their hunt for an elusive 'large feline' prowling the outskirts of the capital.

The hunt for the 'escaped tiger' has been downgraded to 'large cat' search as police admit they do not know exactly what they're looking for, although they have ruled out the possibility it is a tiger.

But security camera footage has now surfaced showing what almost certainly is a large cat wandering past a supermarket in Montevrain, near Paris.

The grainy CCTV footage shows it first emerging from underneath a parked car to the right

It then wanders at a leisurely pace past more vehicles in direct line of sight of the camera

The cat disappears from view only seconds later, but the footage appears to confirm police claims the cat is not a large tiger as was first feared

Tests on footprints carried out by France's National Wildlife and Hunting Board have 'ruled out the presence of a tiger'.

But a statement issued by the local prefecture said a 'feline' was still being looked for, and it was likely to be a 'large one', said a spokesman.

'After an investigation carried out by the National Hunting and Wildlife Office in conjunction with the Parc des Felins (a nearby wildlife park),' the statement read, 'we can exclude the presence of an animal from the tiger species. The feline... is still being hunted.' 

Yesterday heavily armed police stood guard at schools in a Paris suburb as the hunt for an escaped tiger resumed at daybreak.

Worried parents ushered their children through school gates across Seine-et-Marne, to the east of the capital, 24 hours after the beast was spotted prowling the built-up area five miles from Disneyland Paris.

It remains unclear where the animal escaped from but fears are growing that, the longer is remains on the loose, the hungrier and more aggressive it will become.

Still hunting: French gendarmes take part in the ongoing search for what was first described as a tiger on the loose, in the woods of Ferrieres-en-Brie, on the outskirts of Paris

What is it, then? The beast was first spotted near the village of Montevrain, where this grainy picture of a cat-like animal was taken

Specially-trained sharpshooters shifted their focus to an area around a Total petrol station on the A4 motoway towards Paris after a resident spotted a 'large animal' in the vicinity at around 6.45am leading trackers to find paw prints in the mud.

It would suggest that the animal is very mobile, and in fact heading in the direction of the French capital.

The latest sighting has ramped up the urgency of the hunt amid concerns it could be heading towards an area of dense woodland to the south of the busy commuter highway near Jossigny where it would become far more difficult to locate.

Paris-bound? The animal appears to be very mobile, and may be heading in the direction of the French capital

'All precautions are being taken to make sure everybody is safe,' said a local council spokesman.

'Police patrols are being placed around local schools, and people are being encouraged to stay at home with their doors and windows locked.

'The fear is that the animal will be looking for food, and will grow more aggressive and adventurous.' 

After staring directly into the camera, the cat calmly turns away and wanders off into nearby farmland

Elite marksmen armed with tranquilizers supported by a helicopter with thermal imagery have been scouring the area since residents said they saw the animal in France's Seine-et-Marne department, to the east of the capital.

'The alleged tiger is being tracked, but we are trying to intercept it,' a local police spokesman said. 

He added that special officers trained in using tranquilizers were involved, and that the aim was to capture the beast alive.

One wildlife expert said: 'We're going to try and sedate it, but if it becomes dangerous or aggressive, we'll give the order to kill it.'

Search: Members of the police animal brigade check an area surrounding the supermarket carpark where the animal was spotted

The local council has urged residents in the area to stay indoors while they search for the 'giant cat' 

Meanwhile a local council spokesman in Montevrain said: 'We urge caution and please do not walk around the area behind the tennis courts and football pitches, which have been cordoned off since this morning.

'We will keep you updated of all events. We repeat - do not walk around, and take your car instead'.

It was first spotted near the village of Montevrain, where a grainy picture of a cat-like animal was taken.

Police say the aim of the search operation is to capture the tiger alive, with officers used in the hunt specialised in using tranquillizers

Jean-Baptiste Berdeaux, who manages the Intermarche supermarket told reporters: 'My wife saw it this morning. She didn't get out of the car and called me to say 'I think I saw a lynx'.'

There was a circus in the village earlier this month, but all its animals, including tigers, are now accounted for.

'There is no question of a tiger having escaped from this circus, which was very well regulated,' said a town council spokesman.

A spokesman for EuroDisney said the animal was nothing to do with them, as they do not keep live tigers.

Others have pointed out the Parc des Félins big cat park in Lumigny Nesle-Ormeaux – 18 miles away from Montévrain – as a more likely source.

The tiger is the largest species of cat and – beyond zoos and circuses – there are no known communities in Europe.
