A California woman has bravely spoken out after making the horrific discovery that she had been labelled a 'home-wrecker' on a revenge porn site by her boyfriend's ex.

Lorena Velasco admits that she started a relationship with a man she met at work when he was still married but believed he was separated and no longer living with his wife. The relationship did not last long after Miss Velasco, who has a three-year-old son, discovered her boyfriend was chasing other women.

However the soured relationship left more than broken hearts behind - after the man's scorned wife posted Miss Velasco's personal details along with pictures of her on shesahomewrecker.com last November, labeling the mother a 'w****' and claiming that she used drugs. 

It doesn't appear that the 
defamatory profile of Miss Velasco will be taken down anytime soon - and the same goes 
for hundreds of women across the U.S. who have had their nude and sexually graphic pictures posted on the site along with insults like 'fat cow', 'b****', d********' 
and 'pitiful, home-wrecking tramp'.

The site's owner, a suburban mom who goes by the name of Ariella Alexander, defiantly says that she is doing nothing wrong and that the 'scarlet women' deserve to be publicly humiliated because they broke 'girl code' by going after someone else's husband.

Lorena Velasco, from California was placed on the website shesahomewrecker.com by the scorned wife of a man she had a relationship with

Miss Velasco's pictures were stolen from her Facebook page and given by a woman to shesahomewrecker.com

Miss Velasco, from Amador County, told CBS: 'It’s hurtful. It’s very hurtful... I guess she was so scorned that she felt the need to Facebook-stalk me, steal my pictures and say these things about me.'

She added: 'It hurts very badly, but I’d never blame anyone he was talking to and go after them, because that’s on him.'

The ex-wife of Miss Velasco's former boyfriend writes at length as to how she believes she was wronged.

The post reads: 'She is 25 years old, with a 3 year old and is now dating my 40 year old husband. They are both doing drugs, and have since both lost their jobs, and I call that karma! '

The woman who posted the profile of Miss Velasco has not been identified.

Miss Velasco appears to have taken to the website to respond to the attack on her character.  In November, she wrote: 'This is crazy b*******! I’m Lorena Velasco and this is the most 
disgusting thing I have ever seen you used my picture without my consent
 and you slandered my name because I dated your ex after he left you! 
You are truly and sad excuse for a human!'

Miss Velasco with her three-year-old son said that she was very hurt by the online profile that was put online labeling her a 'home-wrecker'

However it doesn't appear that the defamatory profile will be taken down anytime soon - and the same goes for the hundreds of other women across the U.S. being pinned by the site as 'home-wreckers'.

The site is run by Ariella Alexander, who operates under the fake name from her home in Maryland.

Alexander, 36, who believes she is acting within the law, posts the often intimate pictures of the alleged 'homewreckers' along with the women's names, where they live and details about their children and occupations. 

The mother, who also runs a blog where 
she documents her cheating ex-husband's affairs, said that she believes 
some of the alleged mistresses enjoy the attention that her site brings.

Alexander claims that betrayed married women from across the country have sent her more than 1,000 pictures.

She told CBS that she had no intention of taking down any 'home-wrecker's profile' because sleeping with someone else's husband broke 'girl code'.

It is unclear how much money Alexander makes from her business but the website has a number of ad placements.

The sad tales of loyalty betrayed and marriages destroyed fill Alexander's website in an endless scrolling list.

One heartbroken wife from Florida writes: 'Thanksgiving day 2013, I discovered... all the filthy deleted texts. The horrible I love you’s the descriptions of having sex in the stockroom at work. The talk of how they had sex, where they had sex and what they did to each other... The affair had been going on so long I felt sick to my stomach.'

In another a Texas woman sent topless pictures to the website of her daughter's fourth-grade teacher whom her husband was allegedly having an affair.

Alexander's site takes a new spin on revenge porn. Previous cases have seen men post graphic pictures of their former girlfriends and wives in order to humiliate them.

Alexander's site names and shames the women accused of sleeping 
with other women's husbands - with the role of the men in these alleged affairs featuring far 
less prominently on the blame scale. 

The alleged mistresses are tagged with 
long streams of insults and expletives - 'fat cow', 'b****', d********' 
and 'pitiful, homewrecking tramp'. 

Alexander has just launched hesahomewrecker.com where blame for alleged affairs sits squarely with the men.

Revenge porn sites have come under legal scrutiny as more and more disgruntled exes decide to publicly share intimate photos of former lovers in an effort to shame them.

California and New Jersey passed specific laws criminalizing revenge porn - while others including Maryland, where shesahomewrecker.com operates - are considering a change in legislation.

Kevin Bollaert, who ran a California-based revenge porn site, was arrested last month after extorting victims out of thousands of dollars.

He was charged with 31 felonies pertaining to the publishing of 10,000 explicit photos that were sent in from the subjects' ex-partners.

When women contacted Bollaert begging to have their picture and personal details removed, he required that they transfer $350 to an account linked to another one of his sites- changemyreputation.com.

Alexander has no remorse for her site and shrugs off responsibility over the fact that she has no proof that these women actually are the cheating mistresses they are made out to be.

She told America Tonight: 'I can’t be certain for anything I read 
on the Internet if it’s true or not.

'I mean, you can’t be certain. 
Somebody’s telling a story.'

Alexander also edits the photos she receives - often naked selfies of other women that scorned wives have taken off cheating husbands' cell phones.

She won't post naked pictures of women in their early twenties but of those in their thirties, forties or fifties? 

'You know better at that age' is her response.

The suburban mom appears to view her website as a public service for married women.

Alexander also told GMA: 'I think if one woman says, ''Oh my god, I do not want to end up on this website''...because your life is going to be destroyed.'

Under current legislation - the Communications Decency Act of 1996 - Alexander is not doing nothing wrong. Section 230 of the Act says that website operators are not legally liable for the words of third parties.

And Alexander's website comes with a very clear disclaimer: 'The content of all posts and comments on Shesahomewrecker.com represent the opinions of the original poster and are not endorsed, approved or representations of the opinions of Shesahomewrecker.com or its owners.'

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Alexander.
