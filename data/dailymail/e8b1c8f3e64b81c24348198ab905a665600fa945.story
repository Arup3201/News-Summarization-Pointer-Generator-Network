American socialite Justin Ross Lee is the star of an outrageous feature video where he is portrayed as a Frank Abagnale style travel industry hack.

Basing himself on the fraudster who posed as a pilot and inspired the Hollywood movie Catch Me If You Can, the socialite has shared a host of controversial hacks on how he secures upgrades and better hotel rooms when travelling.

His video tips, which can only be taken as tongue-in-cheek, appears to show the young globetrotter adopting multiple personas as he travels in order to achieve elite status at airports.

Justin claims that he uses the first class lounge as an office space because there is WIFI, free food and unlimited alcohol

He claims that he doesn’t scam airlines, but instead takes advantage of where there are holes before referring to himself as an ‘international Jew jetter’ – a term he uses to describe his lifestyle.

He then states that people find serenity in places like central park and that he finds his grounded at JFK airport.

‘I use the first class lounge as an office space. There’s WIFI, free food, unlimited alcohol,’ he says.

Justin has a tip for getting your seat moved during a flight and it involves chutz pah and a bag of peanuts

‘Why spend money on an office space when I can just come here?’

It is at this point that the socialite begins revealing hacks by explaining to the viewer what it is they have to do if they want to stay in the first class lounge for free all day.

And, according to Justin, it’s as simple as buying a refundable ticket to get past security and cancelling it at the end of the day.

The American socialite compares himself to Frank Abagnale, the con-artist the film ‘Catch Me If You Can’ is centred around

Depart at arrivals

According to Justin the best way to arrival at an airport is to do so via arrivals. This way there is no queuing while getting in and you are only required to use a single escalator once through the doors.

Never lose your luggage

It’s the age-old problem with airlines, the worry of losing your luggage. But Justin has an inadvisable way of supposedly ensuring that doesn't happen. He believes that by simply packing a gun – not necessarily a real one – and then declaring it will ensure the airline keeps a close eye on baggage throughout the journey.

Get your seat moved

Now on the plane, Justin has a tip for getting away from someone you don’t want to be sitting next to. Involving a prop this time, the socialite recommends crushing a packet of peanuts, feigning an allergy and simply requesting to be moved.

Upgrade your room 

So you’ve arrived at the hotel but you don’t like your room. Justin has the solution. By doing ‘at least 45 minutes worth of research’ the socialite looks for the most empowered, weakest link among the staff and appears to prey upon them with complaints until they break.

Business cards 

Finally Justin recommends getting yourself an array of business cards, which show that you work for a number of different businesses. This way if there is a particular offer for that company you are eligible for it.

Next the socialite compares himself to Frank Abagnale by suggesting that he has ‘chutz pah’ (shameless audacity) just like him.

The video concludes with Justin reading through some of the hate mail he has received before stating that he is doing something right because he has given them something to talk about.

And noting that he would hate to be normal.
