This bizarre looking sports car wouldn't look amiss on the set of the latest Batman movie.

But while Cate Blanchett and Christian Bale were filming scenes for Knight of Cups in Venice, California, a mystery man was driving this 'batmobile' around London.

Wearing a Black helmet and full leathers, the driver of this black KTM with a Kuwaiti licence plate seemed very keen to keep his identity a secret as he drove through Hyde Park to Knightsbridge in London earlier today.

The KTM car appears to be an X-Bow model - one of only 30 made, which cost more than £60,000 each.

The completely roofless super car is stripped to the bare basics and aimed at driving purists. It can do 0-60mph in 3.7 seconds and can reach a top speed of 137mph.

Onlooker Justin Thomas, 28, from London, happened to be riding his bike home when he spotted the bizarre contraption and quickly took some snaps of the car as it whizzed past.

He said: 'I just spotted this ridiculous
looking car and thought I have to get a photo of it otherwise people 
won't believe I saw it.

'It
was like something out of Knight Rider or Batman. The car would have 
looked more at home on the set of an action movie rather than in the 
middle of central London.

'After taking the photo I gave the driver a thumbs up before he revved the engine and sped off.

'Despite having no roof, the driver must have been quite hot as he appeared to be dressed head to toe in black leather.' 

Super cars are often spotted in Knightsbridge, the London playground for the rich and famous, and many have customised and decorated individually.

In the run-up to the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, one driver even emblazoned a picture of the Royal family on their Lamborghini. 

Meanwhile, many Knightsbridge residents have complained about super racing around London streets at top speeds.

It comes after an Iraqi millionaire was filmed recklessly driving his 200mph super car around London in footage posted on YouTube.

The
millionaire show-off was seen speeding through Knightsbridge in his 
turquoise Ferrari 599 without any regard for the safety of pedestrians 
and other motorists.

Residents have forged a campaign group and aired their grievances to Boris 
Johnson, the Mayor of London, claiming that police and council have 
failed to act over these super car racers.
