A father-of-two and self-confessed 'caveman' has undergone a dramatic transformation, shaving off his unkempt beard and cutting several inches off his hair, as part of Good Morning America's new Valentine's Day makeover series.

Arron McCall, 41, a CrossFit gym owner from Peoria, Illinois, was volunteered for the program's Make Over My Man series by his wife Kelly, who confessed that she had grown tired of being unable to see her husband's face, thanks to his lengthy beard and messy hairstyle.

'It's been three years since I've seen my husband's face,' Mrs McCall told Good Morning America host Lara Spencer.

A new man: GMA's team of style experts revamped Mr McCall's entire look, from his hairstyle down to his shoes and socks

'He looks kind of like a wild man right now. Sometimes it's difficult when we go to restaurants as a family - you can see people turning around to stare at him. 

'He looks scary to some people.'

The couple's two children were also in complete agreement about their father's look, with his daughter telling the GMA cameras: 'I tell my dad he looks like a hobo when he embarrasses me. 

'Like when we're in public and he'll have food stuck in his mustache or something.' 

Even Mr McCall admitted that his style was perhaps more than a little dated, although added that being on the pulse in term's of the latest fashions and styles means little to him in his job as a CrossFit instructor and gym owner.

 'So if I had to describe my look, I would say maybe it's "caveman"?' he said.

Surprise! Mr McCall was only allowed to see his reflection after showing off his new look to his wife 

And it wasn't just Mr McCall's hair and beard that were being made over by GMA's team of experts; many of his favorite wardrobe staples were also up on the chopping block.

'My husband's closet is all CrossFit or workout T-shirts,' his wife explained, while his daughter added: 'It's not OK for my dad to wear cat shirts.'

Undoubtedly realizing that partaking in GMA's makeover program would save him years of nagging from his beloved wife, Mr McCall agreed to put himself in the hand's of the show's expert team of stylists, which included stylist Gretta Monahan, hair stylist Ted Gibson and makeup artist Carmindy.

The team had their work cut out for them, after being given just one hour to completely transform Mr McCall in time to spend a romantic Valentine's Day week with his wife, but managed to perform a style miracle before revealing the fitness fanatic's new look.

Decked out in a blue suit from Zara, plain white shirt and sunglasses, Mr McCall emerged from the program's 'time machine' to rapturous applause, pausing to greet his wife before checking out his new look for the first time.

Fee-line fine: Mr McCall's daughter insisted that her dad get rid of his cat T-shirt as part of the makeover

'Oh my god, I don't recognize myself,' Mr McCall exclaimed after looking in a mirror for the first time since his makeover. 

'He looks so different, he looks great,' Mrs McCall chimed in. 

'It's the best present ever.' 

And it seems that Mr McCall felt just as positive about his transformation; after being quizzed by GMA host Ms Spencer about whether or not he was missing his once-lengthy locks, he insisted that he hadn't even thought about it 'yet'. 

The doting husband added that he would perhaps like to try and style his beloved cat T-shirt with his new look however, saying: 'I could definitely still wear the cat shirt.'
