Steven Fletcher had not scored a goal since December and Sunderland had not won a league game since May — but the Scotland striker put both things right on Saturday with a clinical double in a fine all-round display.

The 27-year-old forward was also the creator of his team’s opener, scored by Connor Wickham.

Only a few weeks ago Fletcher’s manager Gus Poyet dropped the forward from his squad entirely in the hope that it might motivate him.

The move paid off in short order. 

Sunderland’s five points from five draws in six games before Saturday were starting to look like the returns of team that had forgotten how to get across the line. 

This victory had the instant effect of putting the spring back in Poyet’s step.

‘Now we can say we’ve lost one in seven,’ he beamed. ‘It’s a great feeling,’ Poyet said. 

‘I’m very pleased for the players. It was very important for them to win. 

'I’m very pleased for Fletcher because I know how hard it was for him to be left out of the squad. He didn’t like it but he worked hard.’

Stoke arrived in search of a first Premier League win at Sunderland, but a consolation goal by Charlie Adam to make it 1-1 was their only reward. 

Manager Mark Hughes said: ‘That wasn’t great from us. 

'We didn’t defend correctly or with any sense of purpose. We didn’t create enough, either.

‘We want to be viewed as a consistent team at this level and we can do a lot better than that.’

This match did not promise the goals it delivered, both sides having scored a paltry five this season in six games. 

But in starting with an adventurous, three-man attack — Fletcher flanked by Wickham to his left and Will Buckley to his right, Poyet showed intent.

Sunderland were ahead inside five minutes, Fletcher collecting a throw-in down the right-hand side. 

He ran to the byline and fired across goal to Wickham, who steered home with his head while leaning backwards.

Stoke’s equaliser began with Sunderland losing possession in their own half, allowing Victor Moses to run and lay off to Adam just outside the home area.

Adam slalomed forward, dropping his shoulder as he rumbled past Santiago Vergini and John O’Shea before slotting home smartly with a left-foot finish. 

Moses was taken off injured within minutes and replaced by Oussama Assaidi.

Sunderland were ahead again eight minutes later, Jordi Gomez crossing to Fletcher, whose downward header bulleted into the bottom, right-hand corner. It was Fletcher’s first goal in 17 games.

The second half became niggly and disjointed with six bookings and all six substitutes on the field by the 78th minute.

But it was two players who had been on from the start — Wickham and Fletcher — who combined to put Sunderland 3-1 up, the former riding several challenges into the box before laying off to Jack Rodwell. 

He miscued, allowing the ball to fall to Fletcher, who smashed it into the roof of the net.

Stoke striker Peter Crouch came close to scoring just before half-time, bringing out a smart save from Mannone
