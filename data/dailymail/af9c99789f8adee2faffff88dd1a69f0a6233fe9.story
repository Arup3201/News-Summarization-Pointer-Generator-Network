The 17-year-old boy whose 'laser cat' yearbook photo made national headlines has committed suicide.

Draven Rodriguez became an internet sensation last September after he posed for photos in a suit, clutching his cat Mr Bigglesworth, both surrounded by laser beams.

In an online petition that gained national support, he appealed to his school in Schenectady, New York, to publish the unconventional images in the yearbook - and was ultimately successful. 

On Thursday night, he took his own life at home, his parents told The Times Union.

Loved: Draven Rodriguez, 17, inspired a wave of interest and excitement when he posed for this photo with his cat Mr Bigglesworth and a background of lasers. He petitioned for the image to be in his yearbook 

Relatives and friends have paid tribute to Draven's empathy, compassion, and determination to complete anything he set his mind to.

A senior at Schenectady High School, he taught himself to play guitar, rowed boats, and learned to speak basic Russian.

His cat-and-laser photo, which earned mentions on Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show and The Ellen Show, was an indication of his sense of humor, his stepfather Jonathan Stewart said.

'He wasn't trying to stir things up with it. He honestly just wanted a silly photo because he had a great sense of humor.'

At first, the school objected to Draven's request and refused to put his photo in the portrait section.

Eventually, after his plea swept the internet, he was allowed to share the school principal's page - and share the laser photo with her and her chihuahua Vivienne.

Made it: The school principal Diane Wilkinson agreed to the photo if she and dog Vivienne could be in it

Tragic: Draven's parents said he took his own life at home in Schenectady, New York, on Thursday night

Inspiring: His stepfather Jonathan Stewart said Draven had empathy for people and made friends easily 

Photographer Vincent Giordano described Vivienne as a nervous model while Mr Bigglesworth was more interested in the technical aspects.

'Diane and Draven were all laughs, they really enjoyed the photo session,' he told Buzzfeed. 

'Vivienne and Mr Bigglesworth really broke the rules of cats and dogs and got along famously for a trouble free photo session!' 

During the debacle, Draven told the Daily Gazette: 'I don’t want to go in the yearbook with the generic "I-look-like-everyone-else" photo. I wanted a "He looks great, only he would try that" photo. When people look at it, they will know that was me.'

He was the first to admit the original image was over the top, which was the point to begin with.

He always wanted to have fun and was constantly trying new activities such as rowing and reading Russian

'I'm a little out there, and a little tongue-in-cheek,' he said. 'Cats and laser....sarcastic. It's so outlandish and ridiculous.

'I'm not trying to make any statement other than my photo is ridiculous and this is how I am.'

His stepfather said the episode was a glimpse into Draven's inspiring character.

'He made friends wherever he went,' Stewart said. 

'He had friends all over the country - people he'd met at youth-leadership conferences, online, just around town... He had an empathy for the world and for other people that I think is rare in kids his age. It was wonderful to see.'

Draven is survived by his stepfather, his mother Melissa Petersen-Stewart, his 11-year-old sister Lily Stewart, and his father Eric Rodriguez.
