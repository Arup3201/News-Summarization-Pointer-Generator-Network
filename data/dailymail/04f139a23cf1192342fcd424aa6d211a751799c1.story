Many comedy sketches in the closing ceremony were meant to get a giggle from the crowd, but one of the funniest moments was completely unrehearsed - with Boris Johnson and David Cameron leaving viewers on stitches with their 'dad dancing' to the Spice Girls.

The crowd erupted as the Spice Girls drove into the stadium in black cabs to make their first performance together since 2008 when their world tour was cut short.

But as Sporty, Posh, Scary, Baby and Ginger Spice launched into a rendition of Spice Up Your Life while standing on top of their taxis, the camera panned round to show some unlikely stars of the show - Boris Johnson and Cameron strutting their stuff with their wives.

Unfortunately, the London mayor and the Prime Minister gave a prime example of 'dad dancing', getting into 'girl Power' with slightly awkward punching of the arms while rocking their bodies from side to side.

The pair were accompanied by their wives - Samantha Cameron and Marina Wheeler.

Twitter erupted with viewers and even TV personalities commenting on the hilarious footage.

BBC presenter Clare Balding said she was 'crying with laughter' - tweeting: 'Have had to rewind to Boris throwing those shapes & watch it three times.'

While footballer Rio Ferdinand tweeted: ‘Gwaaaarn....Go on Boris Johnson, bopping + I swear singing along to the Spice Girls....Big! Hahaha classic from the future PM!!’

Lee Barratt, tweeting about the closing ceremony, said: 'It was worth watching this just to see Boris Johnson's dad dancing!'

Another Twitter user added: 'Boris Johnson dancing aka funniest thing ever.'

But after shaking some moves, Boris had to attend to his duties, handing over the flag to IOC President Jacques Rogge, who in turn presented it to Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, each waving the traditional four times.

The London mayor's dancing debut comes hot on the heels of him getting stuck on a 150ft high, 1,000ft long zip wire at the London Live event in Victoria Park, east London, when he was left dangling over a crowd of people after losing momentum.
