The plunge in profits at Manchester United looks like a disaster, but that doesn’t tell the whole story. 

The previous year’s financial results were flattered by a £155million tax credit in the US, without which the club would have registered an £8.8m loss.

Cast in that light, this year’s profit of £23.8m looks a lot healthier.

Fans can also take heart from the fact the club pulled in record revenues.

But United’s troubles aren’t over just yet. Next year, revenue is expected to fall sharply due to the failure to qualify for the Champions League.

A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the campaign under David Moyes is likely to cost the club nearly £50m in lost income.

Spending on staff, which includes the cost of signings and salaries, soared by 19 per cent last year. 

Given the phalanx of high-earning arrivals over the summer, that figure looks likely to rise again.

The club will need to be careful it does not live beyond its means for too long, or it could eventually be forced to become a selling club to balance the books.
