Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy have not been included in Didier Deschamps' World Cup squad, despite starring in Manchester City's Premier League triumph.

Southampton's uncapped midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin makes the standby list, while there are several other Premier League players involved.

France are in Group E at the World Cup this summer, and kick off their tournament against Honduras on June 15.

Shock: Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri has been left out of France's provional World Cup squad

Out: Gael Clichy will also not be involved, but Morgan Schneiderlin is on a seven-man standby list

Goalkeepers: Mickael Landreau (Bastia), Hugo Lloris (Tottenham), Steve Mandanda (Marseille).

Defenders: Lucas Digne (Paris Saint-Germain), Patrice Evra (Manchester United), Laurent Koscielny (Arsenal), Eliaquim Mangala (Porto), Mamadou Sakho (Liverpool), Raphael Varane (Real Madrid), Mathieu Debuchy (Newcastle), Bacary Sagna (Arsenal).

Midfielders: Blaise Matuidi (Paris Saint-Germain), Rio Mavuba (Lille), Paul Pogba (Juventus), Moussa Sissoko (Newcastle), Yohan Cabaye (Paris Saint-Germain), Clement Grenier (Lyon), Mathieu Valbuena (Marseille).

Big man: Olivier Giroud makes the 23, along with Arsenal team-mates Bacary Sagna and Laurent Koscielny

Arsenal trio Bacary Sagna, Laurent Koscielny and Olivier Giroud, while Newcastle also have three players included with Mathieu Debuchy, Moussa Sissoko and Loic Remy included.

Deschamps may be looking towards Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema for inspiration in Brazil.

Meanwhile Nasri, who did not expect to be included, is thought to have been left out due to disciplinary problems, leading from Euro 2012.

'He has important status with Manchester City because he starts, which is not the case today in the France team,' Deschamps said.

Nasri's girlfriend posted on Twitter: 'F*** france and f*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager!'

Away from the action: Nasri is currently on tour with Manchester City talking in the Far East

In interviews leading up to his World 
Cup snub, Nasri was reserved, acknowledging that it was unlikely he was 
going to be picked.

'I think the dye is cast. I respect [Didier Deschamps'] choice. I'll watch the World Cup on TV,' Nasri told Canal+.

'If starting games in a club like Manchester City and winning two titles isn't enough, too bad, I won't regret anything.'

Snub: Nasri has barely featured since a three-game ban after Euro 2012 for swearing at reporters

Nasri was 
banned for three matches by the French FA during Euro 2012 after the 
playmaker launched an expletive-laden rant at reporters following 
France's quarter-final defeat by Spain.

He has played just six times since that tournament, but club boss Manuel Pellegrini believes it's a mistake to leave Nasri out.

'The
 manager of France hasn't said about the list, but I can't believe Samir
 Nasri won't be in it because he was one of the best players in the 
Premier League and very important for our squad,' Pellegrini said after 
the Premier League victory on Sunday.

'It will be an important mistake if he doesn't play in the World Cup.'
