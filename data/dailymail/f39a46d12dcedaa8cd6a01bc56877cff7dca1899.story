Accused: Marilyn Edge, 42, allegedly killed her two children after losing custody of them

A mother has been accused of fatally poisoning her 13-year-old autistic son and nine-year-old daughter in a hotel room after a judge awarded custody of the children to their father.

Marilyn Edge, 42, was arrested in Costa Mesa, California on Saturday after she apparently tried to take her own life by crashing her car. She told responding police officers they could find the bodies of her children, Jaelen and Faith, in a room at the Hampton Inn in Santa Ana.

Edge, from Scottsdale, Arizona, has now been charged with two counts of murder with special circumstances and is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday. If convicted, she could be eligible for the death penalty.

Their deaths came after Edge lost custody of her children amid a years-long contentious divorce with her ex-husband. A Georgia judge awarded her former husband, Mark Edge, custody of the children on Wednesday.

She texted Edge on Friday to say she would give him the children on Sunday - but their bodies were found on Saturday.

Mr Edge, who lives in Marietta, Georgia, was told about the deaths early on Sunday by Atlanta police and was taken to a hospital for duress.

'He's emotionally, extremely distressed,' his attorney Marian Weeks said. 'He is getting better. His whole focus right now is on the children.'

Scene: Investigators photograph Edge's car after she allegedly purposefully crashed it on Saturday

Marilyn Edge crashed her car into an electrical box outside a shopping complex in Costa Mesa on Saturday.

She refused to get out and tried to choke herself with an electrical cord as rescuers attempted to free her, Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna said. Police also found propane in the car.

Edge then told investigators they could find her children's bodies at the hotel, police said.

The couple divorced in December 2007 after less than 10 years of marriage. Marilyn Edge had claimed her former husband, who worked as a contractor, failed to make child support payments.

She had also claimed that children of her ex-husband's friend were sexually abusing her son and daughter, but the allegations were never proven, Weeks said.

Marilyn Edge was given full custody of
her children in October 2009, but this was later set aside when Mark 
Edge said he had been working overseas so was unaware of the court date.
The Georgia Supreme Court later found there wasn't enough evidence to 
set aside the ruling, AP reported.

Shocking: One hotel guest called the killings 'horrendous' and 'a heartbreaker'

But in September a judge reduced child support payments and ordered joint custody of the children. Before that point, Edge hadn't seen his children in more than 18 months because his ex-wife refused to let him visit, the lawyer said.

The ex-wife then moved to Arizona, claiming she was taking a job transfer, and Mr Edge only spoke to his children on video phone calls, his lawyer said.

At a hearing on Wednesday, a judge found that Marilyn Edge was alienating her children from her ex-husband and said he should be given full custody, Weeks said.

The judge gave her until noon Sunday to turn over the children. On Friday, Mark Edge received a text from his ex-wife saying: 'I will see you on Sunday and I have their school records'.

Awful: The woman told cops where her children were after multiple failed suicide attempts, according to Santa Ana Police spokesperson Anthony Bertagna

Lawyer Mary Ann Korre said she had 
only represented Marilyn Edge at the most recent child custody hearing 
and had only known her client a few weeks.

She wasn't aware of any reason why her client wouldn't want her ex-husband to have contact with the children. Marilyn Edge was calm at the last hearing and there was nothing to indicate she might harm the kids, Korre said.

'I received the news yesterday and I was just very shocked,' she said. 'It's just a very tragic situation.'

The double homicide left locals and hotel guests stunned.

'My
goodness if there's two children involved that's just horrendous to say
the least,' Mike Ramey told KABC. 'As a parent, it's just a 
heartbreaker.'
