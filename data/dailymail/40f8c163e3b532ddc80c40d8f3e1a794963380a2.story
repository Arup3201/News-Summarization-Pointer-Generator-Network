Joe (left) and Mark (right) Harris are both Liberal Democrats are are said to share a political vision

At just 20 years of age, Joe Harris has already achieved the lofty heights of being elected mayor of his home town.

And he has quickly used his new powers to establish a political dynasty in reverse - by choosing his father to be his deputy.

A Liberal Democrat councillor, Mr Harris junior was elected as civic leader of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, earlier this month.

And he followed his selection on the town council by make selecting his father Mark, 47, as his next in line.

Another unrelated councillor had also been nominated for the post but with the votes tied the casting vote fell to the young new mayor.

The mayor explained: ‘I need a deputy who shares my vision for the town and what we’ve got to do for the future.’

Joe Harris became the youngest councillor in the UK when he was first elected in 2011 at the age of 18.

He is a councillor on Cotswold District Council and Cirencester Town Council and was also recently elected to Gloucestershire County Council.

His father, who is 47, a fellow Lib-Dem, was elected to the town council in a by-election in January.

Speaking of the moment he watched his
son select him as his deputy, the older Mr Harris said: ‘He looked like
one of those judges off the X Factor when they have to make a decision 
they really don’t want to have to make.

‘I wouldn’t have held it against him if he hadn’t chosen me. We have had a few jokes.

‘The banter has mostly been about how we are father and son and now he can discipline me.’

His son added that people were more fascinated by his age than the fact his dad was his deputy.

He said: ‘I think the novelty is more the fact they have a 20-year-old mayor.

Mark Harris with his newborn son (left) and now, as his junior in local government (right). The 47-year-old says he might pull the 'dad card' on his son if he disagrees with him in a council meeting

‘I don’t know what it is really going to be like having my dad as my deputy yet as it has only been a few weeks, but I’m sure it will have its moments.’

Yesterday his deputy denied his appointment was down to nepotism.

PR consultant Mark Harris said: ‘I’m relatively new to local government and the point of view that Joe was looking for was some fresh blood on the team.

‘He said he wanted a fresh pair of eyes and knows that I shared his vision for the future of the town.

‘I think it sets a really good example to the community that a father and son can work together.

‘I don’t know if I would pull the ‘dad card’ on him in a meeting if I didn’t agree with what he was saying, but it’s always a possibility.’

The deputy mayor, who has two other sons, Tim, 18, and Peter, five, has been separated from Joe’s mother for the past eight years.

He added: ‘If they all got involved in politics that would be something.

‘The 18-year-old wants to be an actor, but the five-year-old, you know what they are like, they think they know it all, so I might really be in trouble if he gets involved too.’

Joe Harrisn, who is also on the District and County Council, is single and lives with his mother in Cirencester.
