England striker Wayne Rooney joins forces with superstars Neymar, Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the third part of Nike's 'riskeverything' campaign.

David Luiz, Franck Ribery, Andres Iniesta and Tim Howard also feature in the five-minute animated film entitled 'The Last Game' as the eight players are charged with winning football back having been forced out of the game by dull clones.

Taken away from the game, all eight players are forced to take up 'normal' jobs following the clones' arrival.

Samba stars Neymar and David Luiz have taken up hairdressing with the latter insistent one customer gets a perm similar to his.

Real Madrid frontman Ronaldo is still modelling but has this time been relegated to the role of a mannequin in a shop window while Rooney has become a fisherman working on the docks.

Ibrahimovic, meanwhile struggles to sell old copies of his autobiography and moans: 'I am Zlatan, or I used to be.'

However, Brazil legend Ronaldo - the all-time leading World Cup goalscorer with 15 goals - decides he must save the game by rescuing the players for a winner-takes-all clash against the clones.

Gathering the players in a secret hideout, the former Inter Milan and Real Madrid striker has a job on his hands convincing the eight players that they are capable of beating the clones.

'We all want to beat the clones but they're unbeatable,' stressed Rooney and Zlatan agrees.

Ronaldo insists the players must 'risk everything' to reclaim the game with a passionate battle cry and gets the players on board - despite the fact the players will never play football again should the lose.

With a world-class team, Ronaldo's men get off to a great start as Zlatan Ibrahimovic directs a perfect scissor kick into the top corner. However, the cloned goalkeeper merely raises an arm and the star men know they'll have to up their game.

With Neymar, Iniesta and Cristiano Ronaldo amongst the team's ranks there is no lack of style and the players start to worry their opponents - so much so that hundreds of clones take to the field in a bid to win; but to little avail.

Brazil frontman Neymar produces some mesmerising skill to bamboozle the tens of players blocking his way to goal and even has time to take a selfie with one opponent.

The team finally make the breakthrough as Ronaldo is lined up to thunder a shot from distance into an empty net - but the Portugal star refuses to shoot, traps the ball and confidently says: 'No, too easy.'

Allowing the clones time to regroup, the former Manchester United star then proceeds through a crowded box before controlling the ball on the line and casually backheeling it into the back of the net to claim a victory for football.

'The final 90 seconds of The Last Game prove, beyond any doubt, that brilliant football should be the only kind of football. Brilliant, creative, risk-taking football. That is what #riskeverything is all about,' said Nikeâ€™s Chief Marketing Officer Davide Grasso.
