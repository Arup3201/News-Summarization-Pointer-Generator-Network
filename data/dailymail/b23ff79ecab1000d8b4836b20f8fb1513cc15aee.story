They were supposed to reduce shopping queues, but shoppers are claiming that self-serve supermarket checkouts are sparking colossal lines.

Footage from a busy supermarket in a Melbourne CBD shows a queue that stretches from the checkout to the end of the supermarket and bends around the corner.

The user who uploaded the footage, a 21-year-old-student who was trying to buy just three items at about 7pm, said it took him 25 minutes before he could use the 'express system', reports Nine News.

'There were probably 60 to 70 people,' said medical student Rob. 'It's an issue when you have just a few staff members, and people who are not familiar with the self-checkout system.'

A Coles spokesperson said the store was one of the busiest in Victoria.

He said that in supermarkets where buyers are buying a small number of items, self-checkouts are twice as fast.  

Earlier this year, it was revealed that supermarkets were losing billions by customers thieving products from the do-it-yourself checkouts.

A Coles spokesperson said they were closely monitoring customers to crack down on the rise in shoplifting.  

Medical student Rob said the line had about 70 people and it took him 25 minutes to pay for three items
