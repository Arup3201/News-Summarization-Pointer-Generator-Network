Liberal Democrat MP Mike Hancock's son has been charged with assaulting a photographer outside his father's home.

Police were called to the house in 
Fareham, Hampshire, following reports of an altercation 
between members of the media and a man outside the property.

Members of the press had gathered there in the wake of a leaked report into the MP's alleged sexual advances towards a vulnerable female constituent.

A man has been arrested following an altercation outside MP Mike Hancock's home

Police were called to the house in Fareham, Hampshire, this morning following reports of an altercation

The report, carried out for Portsmouth
 City Council but not published, claimed there was 'compelling' evidence
 Mr Hancock showed 'serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour' towards the woman.

Dean
 Hancock, 37, was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm 
and was released on bail. He will appear at Fareham Magistrates Court on
 February 12.

He was alleged to have headbutted and punched photographer Steve Reigate.

His
 father, the MP for Portsmouth South, has been suspended from the 
party following the leak of the unpublished report into his conduct.

His son is claimed to have charged at photographers gathered outside the MP's detached house yesterday.

He allegedly then squared up to them and prodded their cameras away with his large umbrella.

It is claimed he was trying to stop them photographing his mother as she climbed into her car and drove away.

He earlier told a reporter: 'You have got to be having a laugh,' when they asked to speak to his father about the allegation.

Mr Hancock Jnr is said to have called the gathered press 'idiots' and allegedly threatened to run them over.

Two police officers took nearly an hour to arrive following the alleged assault, which happened just after 9am.

They were joined by five more officers, who arrested a man and drove him away at around 10.40am.

The alleged victim was driven to a police station to make a statement.

A
 Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said officers were called following 
reports of 'an altercation between members of the media and a 
37-year-old man outside the property'.Â 

The
 spokesman said: 'Police officers attended and are conducting an 
investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident.'

The party acted against Mr Hancock Snr after a copy of the unpublished report carried out for Portsmouth City Council, where he sits as a Lib Dem councillor, was posted on the internet.

But party members in Portsmouth accused the leadership of acting without 'due process' while there was still an ongoing civil action in the courts and the council's own investigation was not yet completed.

Mr Hancock resigned the parliamentary party whip last year amid the claims - which he denies - but still sits as a Lib Dem councillor.
