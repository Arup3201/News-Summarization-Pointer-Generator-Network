Jack Brown, 15, who died after being hit by a lorry on the A30 near Hartney Wintney, Hampshire

A 15-year-old schoolboy who died after being hit by a lorry was 'the best son a parent could ask for,' his family said today.

Jack Brown, from Frimley, Surrey, died in hospital after he was struck by a white Volvo lorry.

The teenager was 10 miles away from home when tragedy took place on the A30 near Hartney Wintney, Hampshire.

His family said today: 'Jack was a loving and caring boy who was adored by all his family.

'His energy and humour touched everyone that met him.

'He was a fantastic brother and the best son a parent could ask for.

'We miss you Jack, with all our hearts, and you will never be forgotten.'

The lorry driver and a passenger, two men aged in their 30s, were shaken but uninjured in the collision on Monday afternoon.

They were being treated as witnesses by police, who have appealed for information.

The boy's father, Danny, is understood to be a serving soldier based in Germany.

The youngster lived in Frimley with mother Natalie and three younger siblings - Hannah, Luke, aged two years and baby Lucy.

Jack's friends at Tomlinscote School in Frimley have been devastated by his shock death.

Head teacher Ian Hylan called the death 'deeply upsetting,' and said: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this most difficult of times.

'The school community has been told of this sad news and support is being provided to students and staff.'

Online tributes have described the youngster as a 'lovely boy who will be truly missed by a lot of people,' and a 'happy, smiley boy.'

Another friend wrote: 'RIP Jack Brown aka our batman.'

Hampshire Police said it was not treating the teen's sudden death as suspicious.

In an emotional statement today, Jack's family said: 'We miss you Jack, with all our hearts, and you will never be forgotten.' Hampshire police confirmed they are not treating his death as suspicious

An inquest was opened at Alton Magistrates' Court on Tuesday and was adjourned for a full hearing until May 21.

A post-mortem examination has been conducted.

Acting Sergeant Martin Mundy, of Hampshire Constabulary's Roads Policing Unit, said: 'We are continuing to appeal for other witnesses who may have seen the collision or the events immediately before the impact between the lorry and the pedestrian.'
