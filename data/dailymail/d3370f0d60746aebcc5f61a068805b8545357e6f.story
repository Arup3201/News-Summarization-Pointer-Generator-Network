A 60-year-old woman was arrested Wednesday in Northern Missouri for abducting her infant grandson 13 years ago.

Sandy Hatte is charged with kidnapping the boy while she was keeping an eye on him in his Florida home in 2000.

When the boy’s father arrived home from work, he was gone. The boy was with Hatte for all those years until her arrest last week, at which point he was seized by police at a Livingston school.

Nabbed: Sandy Hatte was arrested Wednesday after living on the run with the grandson she kidnapped from his father--her son--13 years ago in Florida

Hatte is behind bars at the Daviess/Dekalb County Regional Jail under $25,000 bond.

According to WDAF, it was the unnamed boy’s presence at that school that set his rescue in motion.

A school principal reportedly became suspicious when Hatte, who claimed to be his mother, tried to enroll him in the school.

The principal contacted local police, who began an investigation. 

P.I.: Larry Jones helped track Hatte's past on the lam after the boy's aunt enlisted him, reportedly after authorities wrote off the kidnapping as a civil matter

But that was months before the eventual arrest and police failed to look too deeply into the situation, calling it a civil matter.

‘I don’t think anyone was pursuing it because it was grandma who had the kid,’ said Larry Jones, of Black Hawk Investigations.

Jones was brought onto the case when the boy’s aunt, frustrated with the alleged police inaction,  decided to hire a private investigator.

‘I’ve always been a team player and so I considered myself a part of the team, and I was going to do everything I could to have it resolved the way it’s been,’ Jones told WDAF.

Finally: The unnamed boy was taken by authorities at this Missouri school Wednesday after Hatte's arrest. He's now in Alabama with his biological father

Along with Jones, local police detective Eric Menconi and Captain Sindy Fitzpatrick conducted background investigations, reports the St. Joseph Post, which led them to the boy’s biological father in Alabama.

Livingston County Sheriff Steve Cox told the St. Joseph Post that Hatte and the boy had only been living in Livingston County for around thirty days.

He said they’d more than likely spent over a decade in ‘other cities, counties, and/or states.’

And at least one during that time, Hatte and her grandson were homeless.

WDAF reports that Hatte and the boy were taken in by a Chillicothe, Missouri man when he learned they had no place to live.

He learned they were on the run only when police showed up at his door to arrest Hatte.

The boy was since reunited with his biological father at a Days Inn in Chillicothe, and they had a reunion dinner at a nearby Golden Corral.

‘It was a good reunion,’ Menconi said. ‘You could tell within the first three minutes they hit it off pretty well. Since then I’ve been on the phone with the dad and from what I’m understanding it’s going very well. He’s adjusting.’

Homeless: The boy was living in this Missouri house, where a man reportedly took in him and Hatte after learning they were homeless

I don't understand.  You have to show ID and a child's birth certificate to enroll them in school.

Oh of course, poor dad, children should always have their biological parent because matching DNA always means that a person is a suitable parent.

Grandmothers do have a part to play in the upbringing of their grandchildren and love them very much but unless circumstances arise that they are given custody they are always just the backup to the parents. But we don't know the full story here. Who was the mother, why is only the father mentioned etc.

No mention of the biological mother , whom i assume is the daughter of Sandy Hatte.  Is she alive or not.  Confusing to say the least.  So glad that father and child are reunited.  I hope it all goes well for them.

She's a pleasant looking lady isn't she?  Where's the mother in all of this - she's not even mentioned?

Ye gods! A life on the run seems to have been damned hard on her.
