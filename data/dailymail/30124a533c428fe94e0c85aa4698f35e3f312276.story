Juventus playmaker Andrea Pirlo believes Paul Pogba's development would be best served if he stayed in Turin, where he could have a team built around him.

And the ageless Italian says Pogba could even win the Ballon d'Or if he stays in Turin. 

Aged 21, Pogba has no shortage of suitors, and the France international is only going to get better.

The likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea and Manchester United have all expressed an interest in signing the Frenchman,  undeterred by Juventus's £80 million asking price.

Pirlo says that Pogba is the 'future of Juventus' and could win the Ballon d'Or if he remains in Turin 

'That prize (the Ballon d'Or) will always go to a player who scores, one who makes the difference,' Pirlo told ABC Italia. 

'Kaka (2007) did that in his day, the way that Cristiano (Ronaldo) and (Lionel) Messi are doing it now. 

'Pogba could be the future of Juventus. He has it all: physique, technique and an eye for the goal. He is perfect. He can mark an era.' 

 Pirlo has compared Pogba's influence on the Juve team to that of 2007 Ballon d'Or winner Kaka's at Milan 

Pogba has scored seven goals and made three assists in 26 games for Juventus so far this season

Pogba joined Juventus from Manchester United in 2012 on a free transfer after failing to agree a new contract at Old Trafford. 

After failing to replace Paul Scholes, both Louis van Gaal and former boss David Moyes have both lamented United's lack of a 'complete' midfielder.

And if United were to re-sign Pogba for £80m after letting him leave for nothing, it would open up the club to ridicule. But given the player's growing talent, a deal could be on the cards. 

Pogba is in a position to pick whichever club he likes, but leaving a Juventus side that is dominating Serie A and is committed to making him their star man would be no easy task.
