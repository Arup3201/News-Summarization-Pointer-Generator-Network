Aston Martin has revealed its fastest ever production sports car - a V12-powered beast capable of 205mph.

The stunning Aston Martin V12 Vantage S, the latest model from the iconic Warwickshire company, is an aggressive-looking, compact sports car for those who really feel the need for speed.

The firm's engineers have shoehorned a 6-litre V12 engine under the bonnet which cranks out a staggering 560bhp - 55bhp more than its predecessor.

Aston Martin hasn't given a 0-62mph time, but it should be below four seconds. The company has confirmed the supercar will have a top speed of 205mph.

This makes it 15mph quicker than the model it replaces, the V12 Vantage, and puts it in direct competition with the likes of the McLaren MP4-12C and Ferrari 458 Italia.

It is only bettered in the speed stakes by the firm's limited edition hypercar, the 220mph Aston Martin One-77.

But while the sold out One-77 set back its owners around £1.6million, the V12 Vantage S is expected to cost a relatively more affordable £140,000 - £30,000 less than the Ferrari and McLaren.

'Elegant, yet brutal': Dr Ulrich Bez, Aston Martin boss, described the car as being like a 'beautifully tailored suit'

Versatile: The car can be driven in three modes - Normal, Sport and Track - depending on what's appropriate

Dr Ulrich Bez, Aston Martin boss, described the powerful V12 Vantage S as being like a 'beautifully tailored suit' which is 'elegant, yet brutal'.

'The new V12 Vantage S is, simply, pure Aston Martin,' he said. 'It is extreme in its nature yet truly timeless in its design language.

'Learning from our successes on the track feeds the development of this type of car and I'm proud to launch such an exciting sports car in this, our centenary year.'

The car can be driven in three separate modes - Normal, Sport and Track - depending on how aggressive the driver wants to be.

In hardcore Track mode the car will be have a stiffer suspension, faster gear change, more responsive throttle and a louder exhaust tone.

However, the company has attracted the ire of some automotive purists by fitting the supercar with a seven-speed, paddle-shift semi-automatic gearbox.

Fans of the new technology say on the other hand that it offers convenience and ease of use which is unparalleled by old-school manual transmissions.

Steve Sutcliffe wrote on the Autocar website: 'Believe it or not, there is actual pleasure to be had from flicking a downshift paddle at just the right moment and listening to the engine blip to the correct revs.'

The Aston Martin V12 Vantage S is available to order with the first deliveries expected later on this year.
