Billionaire Elon Musk is renowned for his futuristic electric cars, ambitious plans to colonise Mars and concept for revolutionary transport systems.

But behind the headlines, the 43-year-old entrepreneur is said to have a ‘highly skewed’ sense of reality and ‘doesn’t seem to give a damn’ about his employee's family lives.

That’s according to claims made on question and answer site Quora by an anonymous user purporting to be a SpaceX engineer. 

The claims were made by an anonymous user on Quora who claims to be an engineer for Elon Musk’s California-based SpaceX. The engineer said they ‘highly doubt there is a cooler company in the world’, but added Mr Musk (pictured) is difficult to work with, and has a ‘highly skewed’ reality

The question was originally filed in June last year.

The anonymous user said they have been an engineer with SpaceX for more than five years, and that they ‘highly doubt that there is a cooler company in the world than SpaceX.’

‘SpaceX really is awesome,’ they continued, but said they wanted to ‘discuss the side that you won't often hear.’

‘If you want a family or hobbies or to see any other aspect of life other than the boundaries of your cubicle, SpaceX is not for you and Elon doesn't seem to give a damn.

‘You can always tell when someone's left an Elon meeting: they're defeated.

It is unsure who the user is and his claims have not been substantiated. MailOnline has contacted SpaceX for comment. Elon Musk is one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers. But in August, the Tesla founder warned that AI could to do more harm than nuclear weapons (Tweet pictured)

‘These are some of the hardest working and brightest people in the world, mind you. And they are universally defeated.’

The user added that Mr Musk’s version of reality is ‘highly skewed…much like Steve Jobs's "reality distortion field".

Elon Musk is the founder of electric car maker Tesla, and space exploration firm SpaceX. 

The South African-born entrepreneur immigrated to Canada at age 17. 

He then moved to America to study at the University of Pennsylvania. 

Mr Musk made his first fortune by helping set up money service PayPal. 

In September, SpaceX won a $1.6 billion contract with Nasa to resupply the International Space Station with its rockets and launchers. 

In August 2013, Mr Musk unveiled plans for a Hyperloop system that would offer a faster way to travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco. 

Mr Musk described the concept as a subsonic air travel machine that would stretch approximately 350 miles (560 km). 

It theoretically would let commuters travel between the cities in 30 minutes or less. 

He has plans to colonise Mars and has even said he wants retire on the red planet. 

Mr Musk is additionally one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers.

But in August, the Tesla founder warned that AI could to do more harm than nuclear weapons.

‘If you believe that a task should take a year then Elon wants it done in a week. 

'He won't hesitate to throw out six months of work because it's not pretty enough or it's not "badass" enough. But in so doing he doesn't change the schedule.’

But the anonymous engineer said this attitude is understandable.

‘Putting people on Mars is not a small task especially given the overwhelming political obstacles that face SpaceX's mission.

‘Continuously being the underdog and the entrenched politicians that strangely want SpaceX to fail is only a small part of it.

‘SpaceX certainly requires a hard mentality. It is a great company and I do love it. But is isn't the pie in the sky, everything's great idea that so many seem to think.’

On the same thread, former engineer Dolly Singh provided a similar view, adding that working with Mr Musk isn’t a comfortable experience because he is never satisfied with himself, so is never really satisfied with anyone around him.

‘He pushes himself harder and harder and he pushes others around him the exact same way,’ continued Ms Singh - who left SpaceX after five years in 2013.

‘The challenge is that he is a machine and the rest of us aren’t.'

‘So if you work for Elon you have to accept the discomfort. But in that discomfort is the kind of growth you can’t get anywhere else, and worth every ounce of blood and sweat.’ 

Ms Singh also told Business Insider that she believes the claims made by the anonymous engineer 'seem legit.' 

While another anonymous user simply said: ‘There's just one thing I have to say: Elon Musk is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.’
