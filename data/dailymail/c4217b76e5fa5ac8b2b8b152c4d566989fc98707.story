Raphael and Tamar Altman were found dead on their bed and left a simple one word explanation in a diary - 'departed'

The suicide of a devoted couple in a double death pact left a one word suicide note, an inquest has been told.

The husband and wife were found dead in each others arms after drinking poison and leaving a simple one word explanation in a diary - 'departed'.

A coroner heard that Raphael, 69, and Tamar Altman, 72, from Great Milton in Oxfordshire, were both in poor health.

They had been married for more than 30 years before deciding on a death pact on October 3 last year. The couple, both campaigners for assisted dying, were found lying on their bed.

Son Tai told an inquest into their deaths in Oxford: 'They were both activists with the group Dignity in Dying and believed in the right to choose.

'I grew up with it and lived with the knowledge that this was going to happen. It wasnâ€™t a shock to me and Iâ€™m more than reconciled to it.'

The hearing heard that Mr Altman was diagnosed with cancer in 2006 and that his wife suffered from diabetes, neuralgia and muscular pain and stiffness.

In October last year the couple agreed they did not want to suffer any more.

They had drunk a poison, traces of which were found in a bowl and glass by the bed.

Each one left a typed note indicating their plans and a letter to their GP, Dr Lynda Ware, thanking her for years of care.

They had sent an email to their two children and close friends, in which they said goodbye.

Police called to the property said that the room was lit by a soft red light and there was soothing music playing.

Their son, who lives in Inverness, Scotland, said: 'After Dad was diagnosed, mum was always adamant that she could not, and would not, live without him.

'She was brave enough and had conviction in her love for him to make what some people might consider the ultimate sacrifice.'

The Altmans with their children, Tai and Tanyah. The man and wife were campaigners for the right to die

Mr Altman was born in Cape Town in South Africa, and had been a religious education teacher in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, before retiring.

He met Tamar, originally from New York, in the UK and after five years of friendship they became a couple.

They had two children, Tai and Tanyah, and ran a glass painting business for 10 years.

Mr Altman carried on having chemotherapy and radiotherapy after his diagnosis until last year.

As a right-to-die advocate, he gave evidence to the 2012 Government commission on assisted dying.

Mr Altman wrote an article in 1999 for Radiance Magazine, a journal for larger women, in which he praised his wifeâ€™s shape, calling her his 'fat Aphrodite'.

Assistant coroner Peter Clark said the couple had made a careful decision to end their lives in a 'dignified' way.

Recording verdicts of suicide, he said: 'It is clear they intended to die together as they lived together.'
