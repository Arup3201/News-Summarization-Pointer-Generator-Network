Food prices in the biggest supermarkets will rise if Scotland backs independence, retail giants have warned.

Big name stores like Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury's absorb the higher costs of doing business in Scotland so that prices are the same across the UK.

But if voters decide to go it alone in next year’s referendum, Scotland would be treated like other overseas operations where prices are higher.

Costs: Prices in leading supermarkets will rise in an independent Scotland, industry bosses have warned

Longer travel distances between depots and stores in Scotland increase transport costs to good food onto shelves.

Companies which sell alcohol and cigarettes also pay higher business rates.

There have already been claims that an independent Scotland will pay higher energy, mortgage and tax bills.

But the warning that the weekly shop will also be more costly is likely to alarm people who have paid little attention to the debates about currency unions and EU negotiations.

A senior executive at one of the Big Four supermarkets said: ‘We would treat it as an international market and act accordingly by putting up our prices.

‘The costs of distribution are much higher in Scotland but at the moment that gets absorbed by the UK business.’

Each of the national grocers have the same prices in stores of the same size, whether it is in Aberdeen or Andover.

But the ‘national pricing’ policy would end if Scotland became a separate country, and would instead be treated as a foreign outpost.

Morrisons boss Dalton Philips said shoppers in England and Wales should not subsidise prices in Scotland while Asda chief executive Andy Clarke said costs vary across the UK

Andy Clarke, chief executive of Asda, said: ‘At Asda, we believe in fairness so the price customers pay for a pint of milk or loaf of bread is the same regardless of where they live in the UK.

‘However the cost of doing business in different parts of the country does vary.

‘A yes vote in 2014 could result in Scotland being a less attractive investment proposition for business, and put further pressure on our costs.'

Dalton Philips, chief executive of Wm Morrison said: ‘If the regulatory environment was to increase the burden of the cost structure on business, that would potentially have to be passed through to consumer pricing, because why should the English and Welsh consumer subsidise this increased cost of doing business in Scotland?’

A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We’ve got a great business in Scotland and our job is to create the best offer for customers whatever the outcome of the referendum.'

The Scottish government insists there is ‘no reason’ for food prices to rise, claiming ‘Scotland would be more competitive and less costly than at present’.

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond used his launch of his blueprint for independence to boast that the Scottish food and drink sector would thrive

Last month Energy Secretary Ed Davey warned households in an independent Scotland would pay more for energy.

He said: ‘If Scotland votes for independence, and there can be no guarantee of support for renewables in Scotland from English, Welsh and Northern Irish consumers, Scottish consumers and industry could see price rises.’

Last month Alex Salmond launched his blueprint for independence, insisting Scotland’s food and drink sector would thrive.

It stated: 'Scotland’s food and drink industry does an excellent job promoting the Scottish brand, but Scotland is constrained by the current constitutional settlement from directly engaging on a level footing with other countries.

'Independence will boost Scotland’s international profile, delivering new opportunities for food and drink exports, as well as attracting new visitors to our country to enjoy our produce.'
