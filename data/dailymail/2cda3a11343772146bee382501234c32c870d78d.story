If you have ever dismissed exercise as boring, these wacky pictures may encourage you to strap on your trainers.

In a new craze which is sweeping America, joggers are covered in paint as they attempt to complete a 5km run. 

The rules of the Colour Run are simple - participants just have to turn up wearing white clothes and get ready to get spattered.

Tickled pink: The Colour Run started in America earlier this year and now attracts up to 30,000 people at each event

Transformation: When runners finish the 5k race they boast an array of bright colours across their body

Rainbow sky: The colour is a specially made recipe of magical color dust. All products are 100% natural and safe

The craze started in the Arizona earlier this year and now attracts up to 30,000 people at each event across the country.

Founder Travis Snyder 34, from Utah said: 'The only rule is that people wear a white t-shirt at the start and are covered in paint by the end of it. People have a great time and a lot of fun.

'It's all about having fun and enjoying time with family and friends.'

Each kilometer of the event is associated with a designated colour - 1k is yellow, 2k is blue, 3k is green, 4k is pink, and the 5k finish is a 'Colour Extravaganza.'

As the runners/walkers hit the zones, they are blitzed by volunteers, sponsors, and staff with colour. 

The organisers say the colour is a special recipe of 'magical color dust' and all the products are 100% natural and safe -  apparently it is even edible.

Paint by numbers: Each kilometer of the event is associated with a designated color. 1k is yellow, 2k is blue, 3k is green, 4k is pink, and the 5k finish is a Colour Extravaganza

'We wanted to motivate people to come and have fun' said Mr Sydner. 'We did the first one in Arizona in January this year. It sold out after 6,000 people signed up and it's been a crazy ride since then.'We select local charities to work with and we enjoy fostering relationships with them.'People definitely enjoy the day. It's a social opportunity for people to do something with friends rather than competitors.

Painted and proud: Only rule is that joggers have to wear white clothes and they get paint hurled at them as they run the 5km race

Development: The paint idea came from having paint parties in the US. They are like a dance rave and that was successful. There's also colour festivals in India and South America' said Mr Snyder

'All types of people take part - such as young families, students and we see older people as well.'We hope to have one or two races in the UK before the end of the year and we're having a run in Australia in November.

'There's a lot of music during the run and there's a party at the end.'
