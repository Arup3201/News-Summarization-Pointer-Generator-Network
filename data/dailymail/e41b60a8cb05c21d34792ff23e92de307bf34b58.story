A post-mortem on the body of 14-year-old Alice Gross has failed to reveal how the schoolgirl died

Police believe that the chief suspect in the murder of Alice Gross may still be in Britain after it emerged today that they examined CCTV showing him withdrawing cash in Isleworth, west London, the day before he went missing.

The new footage is said to show Latvian Arnis Zalkalns, 41, using a cash machine at a Co-op supermarket near where he worked as a jobbing labourer.

It suggests that the convicted killer could still be in the country. 

News of the new footage comes as Scotland Yard announced that more tests will be conducted on the body of murdered teenager to establish how she died after a post-mortem failed to reach a conclusion.

The 14-year-old's body was wrapped in plastic sheeting and covered with heavy wooden logs when it was found in shallow water in the River Brent in west London on Tuesday night.

Today,  a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'The post-mortem examination into the murder of 14-year-old Alice Gross has now concluded.

'No cause of death has been given at this time and further tests are required.' 

Meanwhile, Alice's older sister, Nina, 19, hit out at the BBC for allowing 'political agendas' to exploit her private family tragedy.

Miss Gross, who is to study at Cambridge next year, branded the BBC 'extremely insensitive' and 'horrible' for allowing her sister's death to be discussed in a debate on immigration issues on last night's Question Time programme. 

She tweeted: 'Now is not the time for these discussions; it is exceptionally insensitive to talk about these issues at this time.

'In future, please respect our wishes as we grieve. This is a personal tragedy which we want to deal with privately, rather than fearing anyone using it for any political agenda.'

In a tweet to the BBC, Alice's sister went on to say: 'It is really insensitive and horrible that you have used our family's tragedy on Question Time.'

Her complaints came last night after a member of the audience asked the Question Time panel if convicted criminals should be allowed freedom of movement across EU borders.

Referring to prime suspect Arnis Zalkalns, host David Dimbleby said: 'This is, of course, referring to the hideous murder of Alice Gross and the person who is being sought, who is a convicted murder from Latvia.'

Liberal Democrat MP Julian Huppert said: 'There was a catastrophic failure in this case, he should never have been allowed to come in. 

'There is a computer system that's supposed to sort this out and for some reason it didn't happen.'

He said the UK should work more closely with other countries and encourage information sharing to better understand who might be entering Britain, adding: 'We have to know who are the people that really shouldn't be coming in – let's keep them out.'

Within minutes of Miss Gross' comments, dozens of social media users condemned the BBC's coverage and called for complaints to be made to Ofcom.

Luke Adar wrote: 'Filled out a full complaint to the BBC, very disappointed that they found it appropriate to use this as a debate topic', while another social media user, Stefan Paetow, said: 'Lodge a complaint with Ofcom.'

Rose Wiltshire said: 'Disgusted with BBC, they should respect your wishes. I'm so sorry for your loss', and Katie Brooks wrote: 'Really feel for @GrossNina and the family after that @bbcqt. Very insensitive timing and harsh to bring it down to another immigration debate!'

Today, the programme was still available to view on BBC iPlayer, but a BBC spokesman issued another apology to the family, saying: 'We reiterate our profound apologies to the family of Alice Gross. 

'Question Time is a topical discussion programme and we recognise the considerable public interest in the issues surrounding this tragedy. 

'We applied careful and due consideration to our choice of question and attempted to deal with this matter as sensitively as possible. We will of course reflect on the family’s comments.'

The prime suspect, Arnis Zalkalns, 41, left, may still be in the UK, police investigating Alice's murder believe

Schoolchildren gathered at the clock tower near Alice's home in Hanwell yesterday to pay tribute to her

The lack of a result from the examination at Uxbridge Mortuary is yet another delay in the case of the Year 10 pupil who went missing after leaving her home in Hanwell, west London, on 28 August saying she was going for a walk.

Despite the Met launching the biggest search operation since the 7/7 bombings in 2005, her body is believed to have lain underwater for weeks in a stretch of river already combed by search specialists. 

Yesterday crowds of mourners flocked to the clock tower near Alice's home in Hanwell to lay flowers and tributes to the murdered Year 10 pupil.

Alice's parents Jose Gross, 60, and Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, said they touched by the support they'd received since hearing the 'completely devastating' news that the body found in the river was their daughter's.
