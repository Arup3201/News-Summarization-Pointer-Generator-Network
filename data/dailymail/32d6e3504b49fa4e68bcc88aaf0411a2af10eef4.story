The forecast was for blue skies and sunshine, but weathergirl Wendy Hurrell's reaction was a face of thunder.

The presenter was caught revealing her frustration shortly after her 10.30pm report on BBC London last night.

The 31-year-old had been all smiles as she predicted warm weather for London the rest of the week.

But when the camera remained on her, Ms Hurrell could be seen rolling her eyes and flicking her hair in an apparent display of contempt.

Cold front: The forecast had been for warm, sunny weather but Ms Hurrell displayed a frosty stare

Gloomy: Viewers quickly took to Twitter to speculate as to what had upset weathergirl Wendy Hurrell

Ice cold glare: Some viewers thought the grimace may have been aimed at news anchor Riz Lateef

Viewers were quick to take to Twitter to speculate as to what had brought on the cold front as clips of the candid moment were posted on YouTube and Facebook.

Some thought that her anger was directed at news anchor Riz Lateef.

One wrote: 'OMG! Did anyone see the eye rolling from Wendy Hurrell at the end of the weather tonight. Tut tut! Me thinks you don't like Riz Lateef'

Another said: '@WendyHurrell you should wait till the camera is off you before you pull the 'I couldn't give a s***' face'

'@WendyHurrell providing much amusement on this sofa with a post-weather eye roll and 'what evs' face,' wrote another.

Plenty of viewers noticed the candid moment caught on camera and took to Twitter to make comments

Twitter user Dom Vizor was among those who found Ms Hurrell's unimpressed expression amusing

Reaction: Ms Hurrell quickly went onto Twitter herself to explain her 'roll of the eyes'

Sense of humour: The presenter was able to see the funny side of being caught venting her frustration on camera

Change of heart: Earlier Wendy Hurrell had seemed bright and breezy during the forecast

Hiding her feelings: Ms Hurrell said she had been frustrated at a series of technical problems during the broadcast

But Ms Hurrell soon took to Twitter 
herself claiming that she was simply frustrated at a series of technical
 faults which had hampered the broadcast.

She wrote: 'The roll of the eyes was because I had to do the whole forecast without being able to see any graphics - it wasn't at Riz Lateef! #techfail'

'And clearly I was kept cut up in frame while I took out my frustration on the nearest and inanimate object (green wall of the studio)!'

The presenter was able to see the funny side of the gaffe, even comparing it to the Will Ferrell film Anchorman.

'It's actually really funny, even I have to admit. Our world is just like Anchorman,' she later Tweeted.

Support: Wendy Hurrell, left, sparked a Twitter storm with her eyeroll but she was given support by her colleague and news anchor Riz Lateef, right, who said she had been frustrated by technical problems

And Ms Hurrell was backed up by her news anchor Riz Lateef who tweeted that her explanation was true.

She Tweeted: 'Thankfully it was not me phew! she was not impressed with the technical fail of having no weather graphics.'

'Ok so it was one of the more 'interesting' late bulletins shall we say. And your comments made @WendyHurrell and I chuckle.'

BBC spokesperson said: 'BBC London has recently moved very successfully into a new studio. Last night we had a couple of technical problems which meant that Wendy couldn’t see the weather graphics and the camera lingered on her too long at the end of the forecast.

'Wendy unfortunately didn’t realise she was still in shot.'
