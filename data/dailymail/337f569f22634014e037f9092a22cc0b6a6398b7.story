A friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on Tuesday of lying during the investigation into the 2013 attack and now faces up to 16 years in prison.

Robel Phillipos, 21, was charged with lying about having visited suspected bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room three days after the attack, which killed three people and injured more than 260.

Phillipos was with two other friends who removed a backpack containing fireworks and other potential evidence three days after the bombing while an intense manhunt was underway for the suspected bombers.

FBI agents testified that Phillipos told them a string of lies about the night of April 18, 2013, before finally acknowledging he had been in Tsarnaev's room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth with the two men who removed Tsarnaev's backpack and computer.

'This is a kid that was likely in the wrong place at the wrong time and didn't do a very good job of choosing his friends,' said Boston College law professor Robert Bloom to WCVB. 

Phillipos' lawyers said he was a frightened 19-year-old who was intimidated by the FBI and too high on marijuana to clearly remember what he did that night. 

The defense called several friends who said Phillipos smoked marijuana a half-dozen times that day.

The defense also called former Massachusetts governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to testify for Phillipos. 

Dukakis, an old family friend of Phillipos' mother, described a phone conversation he had with Phillipos five days after the bombings. 

Dukakis said Phillipos told him he had been questioned by the FBI for five hours, but was so confused he didn't remember what he said.

The defense also claimed that Phillipos' confession was coerced by FBI agents.

Refuting this, the Assistant US Attorney Stephanie Siegmann told the court that Phillipos lied again and again about the night of April 18, 2013.

She said it was inconceivable he could not remember according to WCVB.

'First, ladies and gentlemen, there are some events that are so profound, so significant, that you cannot possibly forget them,' said Siegmann to the jurors during closing arguments.

'Would you ever conceivably forget that you went to the dorm room of someone that you believe murdered three people and maimed hundreds of others?'

Phillipos' attorney, Derege Desmissie, said that this was plainly not fair or true,

He called his client a 'kid' and said that he spent the night in Tsarnaev's dorm room simply watching television that night.

Desmissie said that Phillipos did not remove the backpack or fireworks and did not see anyone else remove them either.

'This criminal mastermind brought his cellphone and did not delete anything related to going to Dzhokhar's room and handed the phone to the agent,' Demissie said according to WCVB.

'It's consistent with a kid who has nothing to hide.'

Phillipos attended high school in Cambridge with Tsarnaev.

In August, one friend Dias Kadyrbayev admitted in U.S. District Court on Thursday that he removed a backpack containing emptied-out fireworks from Tsarnaev's dorm room several days after the 2013 attack that killed three people and injured more than 260 others.

Under the plea agreement, federal prosecutors said they would ask for no more than seven years in federal prisons for the 20-year-old Kadyrbayev. His lawyer still could seek a lighter sentence.And also in July, Azamat Tazhayakov, 20, was found guilty of being part of the same conspiracy.

Friends: Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev (pictured with friend and Boston bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev before the terror attacks) They both removed Tsarnaev's backpack and were convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice

Surprising testimony: During the trial, the defense was bolstered by evidence given by former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis (seen here with Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley on Sunday)

Phillipos apparently showed no emotion when he was found guilty and his sentencing is scheduled for January 29.

Phillipos will not be taken into custody before this and will return home with the GPS tracker he has worn since his arrest.

The two friends who removed Tsarnaev's backpack were both convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice.

Tsarnaev is awaiting trial in the bombings. He has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges and could face the death penalty if convicted.
