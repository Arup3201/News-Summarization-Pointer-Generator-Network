A Daytona Beach, Florida teen is causing strangers worldwide to freeze and stare because of her uncanny likeness to Queen Elsa from the Disney movie Frozen.

Anna Faith Carlson, 18, became an online sensation when she posted a picture of her posing next to a cardboard cut-out of Elsa about a year ago and now she is poised to be offered lucrative TV deals and modelling contracts.

She has over half a million followers on Instagram and a bevy of career opportunities. 

The once local Smyrna celebrity has gained international acclaim and has appeared on television, in magazines, and was even invited to a royal party in the United Arab Emirates.

Fresh faced: 'I definitely feel like I’m living in a fairy tale,' said aspiring model Carlson

'I’m still shocked this has happened,' she told the Daytona-Beach News-Journal.

'I definitely feel like I’m living in a fairy tale.'

Her newfound fame had landed her spots on US television shows and she's been mentioned in the press numerous times. 

When the MailOnline reported on the Elsa lookalike over the summer she expressed interest in auditioning for ABC's new show Once Upon A Time.

Carlson tried out for the role but she was too young.

She says she's happy being a role model for kids.

'It’s crazy because I’ve always wanted this since I was a kid. It means a lot,' she said.

'You can always dream of something, but it might not always come true. I’m so blessed that this has actually happened to my sister and I.'

'I’m enjoying everything so much. I think I enjoy it more than the kids!' 

Over the past year she's been using her storybook looks for good, dressing up as the character to entertain children and cheer-up cancer patients free of charge.

'We of course do the appearances for free,' Carlson said. 'I just love seeing the kids and seeing them smile is so special.'

Carlson says she noticed the similarities between her and the Disney character when she first saw the film in December, calling the experience eerie.

'It's a crazy resemblance,' Carlson told the Orlando Sentinel.

'Every time I watch [the movie], it's weird because it's like I'm watching myself. It's kind of creepy.'

Carlson recalled not even wanting to take a photograph with the cardboard cut-out because her hair was messy.

'We had just finished a modelling job in Orlando and my mom and best friend wanted me to take a picture with the cut-out,' Carlson said.

'My hair was up and I looked like a mess, so I didn't want to at first.'

Now Carlson's job has become that of a professional Disney Princess with a little bit of help from her mom.

'We never thought of this as a business,' said Karen Carlson, who manages her daughter’s schedule.

Carlson once solely made free appearances in which she sings songs like 'Let It Go' to sick children but now she is starting to make revenue from her various media appearances,

She has visited children in the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and has plans to appear at a fundraiser in Wisconsin for three cousins killed in a car crash.

'If we could only do all of them,' Anna Faith said.

'When I see the parents cry, it shows the kids are having a good time. There’s nothing that can describe their happiness.'

Her fame has also allowed her family to travel together and went to a party in Dubai for the daughter of a member of a royal family.

Carlson’s sister Lexus accompanies her to the appearances dressed as Princess Anna, Elsa’s auburn-haired sister.
