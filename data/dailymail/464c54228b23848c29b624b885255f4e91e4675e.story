Tim Cahill grabbed an assist on his Shanghai Shenhua debut as they beat Shanghai Shenxin 6-2 on the opening day of the Chinese Super League season.

The Australian joined the club, whose former players included Nicolas Anelka and Didier Drogba, last month after leaving MLS side New York Red Bulls by mutual consent.

Former Palmeiras striker Paulo Henrique scored a hat-trick while goals from You-Hwan Lim, Giovanni Moreno and Stopilla Sunzu completed the rout.

Cahill took to social media after the game to voice his pleasure at the result. 

He said: 'What a great start to the season 6-2 at home and fans were bouncing, they didn't stop singing the whole game. 

'This was an amazing experience for me. 75mins unlucky not to score, happy with the assist but more importantly the chemistry was good and we played well. Feeling at home.'

The result leaves the Blue Devils top of the table on goal difference.
