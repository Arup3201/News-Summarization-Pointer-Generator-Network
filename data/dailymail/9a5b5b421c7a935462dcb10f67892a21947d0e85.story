A man wielding a knife was able to jump the White House fence just over a week ago.

Now, the Secret Service has been accused of fumbling its response to another threat.

Officers allegedly performed a string of security lapses after gunman Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez fired around eight bullets at the executive mansion in November 2011.

'Fumbled': The Secret Service allegedly performed a string of security lapses after Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez fired at the White House in 2011. Above, officers examine a broken window after the attack

Damage: Ortega-Hernandez parked his black Honda south of the White House, before pointing his gun at the home of President Barack Obama and firing off a series of bullets. One smashed this window (pictured)

Jailed: Earlier this year, Ortega-Hernandez, from Idaho, was sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to firing an assault rifle at the White House

Ortega-Hernandez parked his black Honda south of the Washington building, before pointing his semi-automatic pistol out of the passenger window.

He then aimed it directly at the home of President Barack Obama and fired off a series of bullets, one of which smashed a window on the second floor, just inches from the first family's living room.

It was only stopped from going inside the White House by the bulletproof glass interior layer behind it 

Another bullet got stuck in a window frame, while others smashed into the roof, causing nearly $100,000 worth of damage.

Weapon: Ortega-Hernandez used this weapon to fire off around eight shots at the White House. One bullet got stuck in a window frame, while others smashed into the roof, causing nearly $100,000 worth of damage

Fleeing: The convict is seen allegedly fleeing from Washington aboard a freight train in this 2011 photo introduced by U.S. prosecutors as evidence in Federal Court in Washington

Although President Obama, his wife Michelle and their older daughter Malia were not at home at the time, their younger daughter Sasha and Mrs Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, were inside. 

In accordance with protocol, Secret Service officers rushed to respond, with one stationed under the second-floor terrace withdrawing her handgun and snipers on the roof preparing for action.

However, they reportedly halted their response when they were wrongly informed, 'No shots have been fired... stand down', by their supervisor.

The supervisor claimed the noise had instead stemmed from the backfire from a nearby construction vehicle, according to information obtained by the Washington Post. 

Executive mansion: It apparently took the Secret Service four days to conclude that gunshots had struck the White House (pictured) - with their findings mainly based on the discovery of broken glass by a housekeeper

It apparently took the Secret Service four days to conclude that gunshots had struck the White House - with their findings mainly based on the discovery of broken glass by a housekeeper.

Supervisors had previously come up with a number of theories, including the possibility that two gangs had got into a gunfight near the mansion's front lawn, it is reported.

The recent allegations were unearthed by the newspaper following interviews with agents, investigators and government officials, as well as the review of hundreds of documents. 

Earlier this year, Ortega-Hernandez, from Idaho, was sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to firing an assault rifle at the White House.  

Previous incident: Last week, Omar Gonzalez, 42, was arrested inside the Presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn (pictured), the Secret Service said

Ortega-Hernandez's lawyers had asked for a 10-year sentence, arguing he was suffering from extreme depression and was under the misguided belief that Armageddon was coming. 

Although prosecutors had initially charged Ortega-Hernandez with attempting to assassinate President Obama, they agreed to drop the charge as part of a plea deal last year.

Meanwhile, last week, Omar Gonzalez, 42, was arrested inside the Presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn, the Secret Service said.

President Obama and his family were not in the mansion at the time.

White House pair: Gonzalez, a 42-year-old Iraq veteran (left) and Kevin Carr, a 19-year-old college student (right) were both arrested after trying to get into the White House within 24 hours of one another

And just one day later, Kevin Carr, 19, was taken in by officers after allegedly driving a car up to a screening point then refusing to leave when he was asked. 

The two attempts to gain entry to the White House prompted the Secret Service to increase security by stepping up patrols around the building.

It has been suggested they could set up security checkpoints around the building for the public.

Both Secret Service and White House spokesmen declined to comment to the newspaper.
