Just two months after anti-Semitic flyers were distributed across Sydney's eastern suburbs, the same Sydney Neo-Nazi group has sent out more vile letters - this time accusing Jewish residents of swindling tax payers' money.

It appears the letters were prompted by reports of  a bomb proof wall which is being constructed at a local Jewish school and funded by the federal government.

Since August, the Jewish community have been the target of anti-Semitic slurs including a group of teenagers who allegedly launched a tirade at Jewish students when they boarded a bus in Randwick, Sydney's east.

Another incident involves residents in Bondi receiving anti-Semitic flyers in their letterboxes which urged 'white Australia' to 'wake up'.

Two months ago this flier was distributed around Bondi in Sydney's east, which has a high population of Jewish people

More flyers were distributed around the same area in response to the construction of a bomb proof wall at a local Jewish school

The concrete wall in front of Yeshiva Centre in Bondi was funded by private donations and $519,000 granted through the federal government's 2012 $20 million Secure Schools Program

The recent flyer, signed off by a Sydney chapter of Stormfront called Squadron 88, attacks Jews by describing the community as 'the leering hooked nosed race of people' while questioning the erection of 'a security school wall in one of the safest parts of Sydney'.

'Are you living next door to these people? The people who steal billions of our money?' the flyer continues.

'It's time for all White Australians to stop being blinded by political correctness and Jewish lies about equality, multiculturalism and the need for so called diversity. Diversity really means white genocide.' 

Daily Mail Australia previously reported the Yeshiva Centre in Bondi put up the concrete wall in front of its college last month, as part of security measures due to the rising anti-semitism in the area.

The construction was funded by private donations and $519,000 granted through the federal government's 2012 $20 million Secure Schools Program.

It is understood the wall, designed with the help from Israeli expertise, can withstand the force of a car bomb outside the centre. 

The letter was signed off by Squadron 88 which is a Sydney offshoot of neo-Nazi group Stormfront, whose logo is pictured here

Several incidents aimed at Jews have occurred over the past couple of months

CEO of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies Vic Alhadeff previously told Daily Mail Australia that 'it's no coincidence that 88 [in Squadron 88] represents HH, which stands for Heil Hitler'. 

He made the comments after residents in Bondi received anti-Semitic flyers in their letterboxes two months ago, which urged 'white Australia' to 'wake up'.

The letters claim 'the Jews' encourage 'race mixing' and that they 'own' Hollywood and the majority of western media. 

Another incident involved a group of teenagers who allegedly launched a tirade of anti-Semitic slurs when they boarded a bus in Randwick, Sydney's east, in August.

Children as young as five were among the busload terrorised on when the young men dressed in baggy pants and t-shirts boarded the bus at Randwick, just before 4pm.

Several students made frantic calls to their parents after the youths started yelling 'kill the Jews' and 'free Palestine', and 'Heil Hitler'. 

Daily Mail Australia is waiting for a response from Squadron 88.
