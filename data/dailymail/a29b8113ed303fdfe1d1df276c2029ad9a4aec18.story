West Ham eased to a 3-0 home win over Hull City on Sunday afternoon courtesy of second-half goals from Andy Carroll, Morgan Amalfitano and Stewart Downing.

ADAM SHERGOLD provides an assessment of each player involved at Upton Park. 

WEST HAM UNITED 

Adrian - The Spanish goalkeeper had been West Ham's penalty-taking hero in the FA Cup last week but this was a far more mundane afternoon. Didn't have too many saves to make, even during the first-half which was dominated by Hull. Showed some weaknesses - a loose clearance on 13 minutes was seized upon by David Meyler and he spilt a cross shortly before the break. 6

Carl Jenkinson - was able to stride confidently forward more and more as the match wore on as Hull retreated into their shell. Jenkinson completed his defensive and offensive duties well and never looked hurried, with the exception of a late cross that spooned into the stand. 6.5

James Collins - solid performance at the heart of the defence until he hobbled off with an injury early in the second-half. He bailed out the overwhelmed Tomkins when Sone Aluko was bearing down on goal after 23 minutes, coming across to clear for a corner. Collins was also more than willing to play a long ball in the direction of target man Andy Carroll. 6

James Tomkins - looked as though he was in for a torrid afternoon when Hull striker Sone Aluko tricked his way past him three times in the opening 25 minutes. The worst one saw Collins have to rush across and clear. But once Tomkins found his composure, and Hull's challenge faded, he was fine. Might have scored when he headed over Noble's swerving corner on 12 minutes. 5.5

Aaron Cresswell - like Jenkinson, was given plenty of scope to push further forward as Hull's challenge dropped off after half-time. He wasn't shy in supporting the wingers, delivering crosses or even shooting for goal, as shown by a sixth-minute strike that bounced narrowly wide of the mark. 6.5

Alex Song - As usual, his work rate was exemplary from the outset, always gravitating into space to attract a pass. Did play some loose balls as Hull's midfield seized control in the first-half but helped swing the balance back the other way after half-time. This was shown by the short burst and magnificent through pass that allowed Stewart Downing to race clear and score the third goal. 7.5

Mark Noble - struggled to get a stranglehold on the midfield battle initially and his frustrations were shown by a 20th-minute yellow card for a late follow-through tackle on Tom Huddlestone after he'd given the ball away. Helped enforce and sustain West Ham's superiority after the break until replaced by Morgan Amalfitano on 65 minutes. 6

Kevin Nolan (c) - again, helped haul West Ham's midfield on top as the match wore on and Hull's attacking instinct was blunted. A tough chance came to him early in the second-half after Stewart Downing crossed and he couldn't keep his shot down. Struck the crossbar from an almost impossible angle five minutes from time as West Ham looked for added gloss on the scoreline. 7

Stewart Downing - West Ham's stand-out performer on the day, Downing grew into the game and was a constant threat out wide with his dribbles and crossing. His performance was capped with a serene left-foot finish for the third goal after Alex Song's exemplary through ball set him into the clear on 71 minutes. 7.5

Andy Carroll - A nuisance to the Hull back-line throughout, initially with his hold-ups and knock-downs to Enner Valencia which were important in the first-half as Hull were the better side. Once he had poached his goal on 48 minutes, getting in front of Curtis Davies to anticipate Allan McGregor spilling the ball from Valencia's shot, the game changed in West Ham's favour. 7

Enner Valencia - lively and energetic as has become expected. The first-half saw him dropping a little too deep as West Ham struggled to create anything in attack but his powerful shot three minutes after the break led to McGregor spilling and Andy Carroll opening the scoring. He also supplied an excellent assist to Morgan Amalfitano for the match-settling second goal on 69 minutes. 7

SUBSTITUTES 

Winston Reid (for James Collins 49) - assured at the back as Hull's attacking instincts dulled in the second-half. 6

Morgan Amalfitano (for Mark Noble 65) - a lovely composed finish for West Ham's second goal after having the presence of mind to find space in the right channel. 6.5

Joey O'Brien (for James Tomkins 75) - helped ensure there would be no drama late on. 6

Substitutes not used: Jarvis, Jaaskelainen, Poyet, Cole

HULL CITY

Allan McGregor - had rarely been troubled in the first-half as West Ham struggled to impose themselves but was ready and alert towards the end to dive low and bravely deny Valencia just in front of the goal. But he made a real hash of stopping Valencia's shot early in the second-half, spilling it out for Carroll to profit. 5

James Chester - withdrew from the match prematurely with what looked to be an arm or shoulder injury after James Collins landed awkwardly on him following a corner. Prior to going off in stoppage time, Chester had enjoyed plenty of space down the right-flank and was often able to get into a crossing position. 6

Alex Bruce - Wasn't overly taxed in the first-half as those further forward made all the running in the game. Rescued his side with a clearance following a teasing free-kick delivery on 39 minutes and then took a hefty whack to the face that led to his withdrawal at the break. 5 

Curtis Davies (c) - responsible for the game's pivotal moment when he was too slow to react to Andy Carroll's dart across him to give West Ham the lead. Until that point had dealt well with the rare attacks West Ham had produced. After that point shared the nervousness that infected the Hull back line. 6

Michael Dawson - handled most things that came his way in the air, even against Andy Carroll, and looked resolute in the first-half. He gave a sheepish smile after a massive let-off in the second period when his careless sideways pass across the edge of the box was seized upon by Valencia. He broke defensive rule No 1 there. 6 

David Meyler - intelligent in his passing and movement, Meyler was a key component as Hull dominated the first 45. One moment of note was when he combined well with Quinn to launch an attack on 37 minutes. Like his team-mates, was knocked back by West Ham's first goal and was never quite able to find his rhythm again. 6 

Tom Huddlestone - in good form during the first period in terms of tackles to instigate attacks, reading of the play and also a couple of chances that were wide of the mark. Failed to replicate this after half-time as Hull lost their 'bite' in midfield. 6

Jake Livermore - was responsible for many of the slick and accurate passes through the midfield that made Hull look so impressive before the break. But as they were unable to gain a goal, their impressive play counted for nothing and Livermore was, like many of the others, a passenger in the second-half as West Ham turned it on. 6.5 

Ahmed Elmohamady - his long strides were a feature of the opening 45 and West Ham afforded him too much respect coming forward. He had fired the opening salvo on five minutes, firing a fierce right-foot shot wide. Was booked for the faintest of clips on Downing. Like the others, lacked impact after the break. 6 

Stephen Quinn - looked threatening down the left flank before half-time and combined well with Livermore and Meyler. He evaded the offside trap on 31 minutes but his cut-back from a very good position was poor. Grew more ineffective and frustrated in the second-half and was booked for an over-zealous tackle on Amalfitano on 74 minutes. 6 

Sone Aluko - made a blistering start to the match and had James Tomkins in knots twice inside the opening two minutes alone. He also showed incredible pace to set up a chance for Elmohamady on five minutes. His best chance arrived on 23 minutes but he seemed to falter in front of goal, took too many touches and was snuffed out by Collins. Made little difference in second-half. 6.5

SUBSTITUTES

Maynor Figueroa (for James Chester 45+3) - was kept busy but unable to stem the Hammers tide. 5.5

Harry Maguire (for Alex Bruce ht) - thrown on ostensibly as a defender but quickly pushed into a more forward-minded position. 6

Yannick Sagbo (for Curtis Davies 70) - arrived with too little and too late to affect the outcome. 5

Substitutes not used: McShane, Harper, Ince, Ramirez
