Neil Roy Harvey has threatened to sue police after they falsely identified him as being one the Northern Territory's eight most wanted criminals.

In the blunder, the 43-year-old of Palmerston, appeared on the list when Northern Territory Police wrongly updated it on Tuesday.

But it was not until Wednesday that a correction was issued and Mr Harvey was removed, reported NT News.

Neil Roy Harvey was falsely identified by police as being one the Northern Territory's eight most wanted criminals and is threatening to take legal action over the mistake

It had been stated by police that Mr Harvey was wanted for not appearing in court in March for the alleged assault of a female.

But Mr Harvey had actually been arrested last Saturday, three days before his name appeared on the list on a police website.

He is due to face court today and said a senior officer went to his house on Tuesday afternoon the apologise for the gaffe.

'He was very apologetic and was saying they’re looking at ways to make sure it never happens again,' he said.

'But to me that’s not good enough and I’ll be taking it further. I’ll be taking legal action.

'They’ve made me out to be one of the Territory’s worst criminals and saying they’ve been looking for me since March but they’ve known all along where I live. I haven’t gone anywhere.'

Mr Harvey, a fishing guide, said he was at sea when he was due to appear in court and denied being 'on the run'.

'For the police to put this out, it’s already had an impact on my reputation and it will continue to do so,' he said.

In a correction issued on Wednesday, the police confirmed the Territory's Wanted list went live on the Police, Fire and Emergency Services website on Tuesday morning.

The correction states Northern Territory Police have corrected the error in relation to Mr Harvey, who is no longer the subject of Territory’s Wanted.

'This person had been the subject of police attention since a warrant was issued on March 14, 2014. He was subsequently arrested by Police on May 17, 2014 and is due to appear before the court on May 23, 2014,' the correction reads.
