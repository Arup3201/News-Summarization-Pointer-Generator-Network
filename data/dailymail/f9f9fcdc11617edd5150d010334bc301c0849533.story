Manuel PelIegrini backed Stevan Jovetic to finally his make mark on Manchester City after seeing the Montenegro striker lead the demolition of AC Milan in Pittsburgh.

Jovetic scored twice and was denied a hat-trick by an offside flag as City won 5-1 at Heinz Field.

It was a demonstration of what the 24-year-old can do after his first season at City was decimated by injuries following a £22million move from Fiorentina.

VIDEO Pellegrini delighted at rampant City  

Jovetic only made 18 appearances - including two Premier League starts - and scored six goals.Pellegrini said: 'With Stevan I think he had very bad luck last season. He had a lot of injuries the whole year.

'It's very difficult for a player to have an important performance when he cannot play three games in a row. At the end of last season he started playing very well.

'Now that he works continually he will demonstrate why he's here at Manchester City. I think he's a very good player.'
