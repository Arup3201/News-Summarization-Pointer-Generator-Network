The first laboratory chimpanzees from a south Louisiana research centre have got a taste of the great outdoors after they were 'retired' to a national sanctuary.

Nine chimps were taken from University of Louisiana at Lafayette's New Iberia Research Center and have been given a sprawling home in the 'Chimp Haven' sanctuary in Keithville.

And as these photos show, the chimps were thrilled - if a little nervous - about their new home.

The curious creatures munched on fruit and explored their new home, larking about in the sunshine and wandering around their wild habitat.

The research centre, which no longer has an NIH chimp research contract, is expected to deliver seven more tomorrow and a further 95 will make their way to the outdoor haven in the following months, according to Yahoo.

The huge research centre, which has 
'6,000 non-human primates representing eight species' studies and tests 
chimps for 'research aimed at promoting human quality of life.'

The NIH proposal calls for major cuts in grants to study chimps in laboratories

On its website it says that it 
'specializes in the breeding, management, and importation of a diverse 
range of nonhuman primate species'.

The laboratory 'offers a broad range of 
diagnostic, laboratory, and human resources for the development and 
characterization of nonhuman primate models for applied and basic 
research.

A National Institutes of Health committee is recommending that all but about 50 of the agency's hundreds of research chimpanzees should be retired to the outdoor sanctuary, which was created on 200 acres of a Caddo Parish park.

The NIH proposal, which will go to the agency's director after a 60-day public consultation period, also calls for major cuts in grants to study chimps in laboratories.

It also calls for labs to maintain their policy of not breeding the great apes for research.

Kathleen Conlee, the Humane Society of the United States' vice-president for animal research issues, said the sanctuary is the most 'appropriate' place for the animals, and was disappointed that there was a recommendation to retain 50 of the creatures.

She said: 'I'm glad they made clear those animals should be kept to much higher standards than they are currently being kept in.'

A $30 million cap on total spending for construction and care of Chimp Haven's retirees has been looming, Yahoo reported.

Conlee said the Humane Society will urge Congress to move money now spent on research contracts to Chimp Haven. The sanctuary gives the animals better care for less money than the labs are paid, she said.

The Chimp Haven boasts groundcover, trees, and climbing structures provide a stimulating environment crucial for the primates' development and rehabilitation.

The chimpanzees can make sleeping nests from vegetation provided by staff or they can build nests from the trees and plants found in the wooded habitat.
