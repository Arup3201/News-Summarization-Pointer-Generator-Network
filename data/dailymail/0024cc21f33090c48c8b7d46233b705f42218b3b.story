Culture Secretary Maria Miller claimed a 'climbdown' by Mr Miliband had brought the parties closer to launching a powerful newspaper watchdog which would implement fines of up to £1million

Talks on a new Press regulation system were on a knife-edge last night as David Cameron tried to head off a damaging Commons defeat.

The three party leaders were inching towards a deal on a Royal Charter to enshrine a powerful newspaper watchdog which would implement fines of up to £1million.

Tory sources claimed that Labour and the Liberal Democrats – who joined forces to try to force through laws shackling the 300-year-old free Press – had offered key concessions.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller claimed a ‘climbdown’ by Mr Miliband had brought the Opposition ‘much closer to our position’.

But Downing Street also appeared ready to give ground in an attempt to head off what looked like inevitable defeat in Parliament tonight.

Cross-party talks on how to take forward the recommendations of Lord Justice  Leveson’s report on media standards collapsed last week when the Prime Minister lost patience with fresh Labour demands.

Yesterday, however, it emerged that Mr Cameron and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg had met face to face and reopened negotiations ahead of a crunch Commons vote due tonight. 

Tory whips have warned the Prime Minister he is likely to face defeat thanks to combined Labour and Lib Dem votes if he presses ahead with his version of a Royal Charter.

Around 20 Tories are thought to be ready to back the Lib/Lab pact.

Mr Cameron last night appeared ready to contemplate a single clause in legislation to ensure that the Royal Charter could not be amended in the future without two-thirds majorities in both Houses of Parliament and the agreement of all three party leaders.

Differences between the parties remained over key details of the new rules governing the Press, including the prominence of apologies required by a new regulator and the right of the industry to object to who sits on it.

Chancellor George Osborne said he hoped a last-minute deal could be found, warning that a regulatory system without cross-party support was unlikely to last.

‘There is still an opportunity for us to get together and get a Press law that works,’ he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. ‘Ultimately we are not about grandstanding on this; we are about getting a law that works.’ 

Mrs Miller added: ‘Labour has been trying to push through a tough form of statutory regulation for the Press with really unacceptable consequences for freedom of speech in this country. 

‘I think their climbdown from that position has put them much closer to our position, and that is to be welcomed.’ 

Labour said it had not been approached over any new cross-party talks. A senior source said: ‘We are in lock-step with the Lib Dems on this. Any agreement must be on the basis of our Royal Charter. We are planning to go ahead with the votes in the Commons.’

Mr Miliband urged MPs to ‘stand up for the victims’ of Press intrusion by enshrining a new regulator in law. His deputy Harriet Harman, the party’s media spokesman, suggested it wanted the Press to be prevented from writing about private lives.

‘There are a lot of things that can turn people’s lives upside down that are not criminal offences and that’s what we need to ensure that we protect people from,’ she told the BBC’s Sunday Politics.

Press Complaints Commission chairman Lord Hunt said publishers were ready to sign up to a tough new ‘Leveson-compliant’ watchdog but believed statutory underpinning would send a dangerous signal to the world about Press freedom.

He said publishers ‘have all agreed to have a new body and a fresh start – with teeth’. What was proposed was ‘probably the strongest regulatory body in Europe: ability to fine; ability to carry out investigations’.

‘They have all signed up to that and they just say “we don’t need statute; the last thing we should do is send a message across the world that the UK now has a Press law.’

The pressure group pushing for statutory Press regulation plotted to exploit the parents of murdered Milly Dowler to achieve its political aims, a leaked briefing note revealed yesterday.

A ‘strategy document’ drawn up by Hacked Off set out plans to draw up a ‘Dowler test’ that it could use to force David Cameron into shackling newspapers.

It said that Hacked Off itself would make up the Dowler test, and ‘the Dowler family must support that definition’.

Both Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have repeatedly referred to the Dowlers in their recent public statements on Press regulation.

The exploitation of Bob and Sally Dowler – described as ‘hypocrisy and cynicism’ by senior Tory MP David Davis – is outlined in the leaked memo produced for leaders of Hacked Off in September.

The document said that Hacked Off has just one aim, to establish ‘an independent statutory regulator with punitive powers’. To achieve this, the organisation intended to invent a ‘Dowler test’.

The memo said: ‘The expression the Dowler test has pushed its way into the popular political lexicon, when in fact it doesn’t exist. Not yet that is. We need to define what the Dowler test actually is.’ 

It referred to the Prime Minister’s evidence to Lord Justice Leveson last June in which Mr Cameron said that the present Press self-regulation system had failed families such as the Dowlers and the parents of missing Madeleine McCann and that was ‘the test’.

The PM also said the present Press self-regulation system had failed families such as the Dowlers and the parents of missing Madeleine McCann

The Hacked Off document said: ‘He (Cameron) would favour a robust form of self-regulation as long as it passed the Dowler test. We can use these words against him. Defining the Dowler test is key.

The Prime Minister cannot go back on it. The opposition must not be allowed to define it, we must.’

The memo then says that Milly Dowler’s parents must be seen to back the Hacked Off test. ‘The Dowler family must support that definition; it is in their name that we act.’

The document, drawn up by Hacked Off head of campaigns Ella Mason, was presented to a meeting at the London headquarters of law firm Mishcon de Reya on 19 September last year. 

The meeting was held in the office of Charlotte Harris, a lawyer representing a number of phone hacking victims, and was attended by the group’s founder Brian Cathcart and Hugh Grant, one of its directors.

It also advocated approaching disillusioned Right-wing Tory MPs to undermine Mr Cameron on his own back benches. The memo indicates that Hacked Off and its leaders regard such MPs with distaste.

It added that Hacked Off would say different things to different people depending on what it thought they were most likely to want to hear. ‘Our messages will differ depending on whether these groups are left or right-leaning.’ 

Hacked Off confirmed yesterday that the document, leaked to the Mail on Sunday by a whistleblower said to be disenchanted with the group’s message, was genuine.
