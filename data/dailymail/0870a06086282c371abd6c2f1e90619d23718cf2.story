A Seattle man attempting to dribble a soccer ball 10,000 miles to Brazil in time for the 2014 World Cup for charity has died after being hit by a pickup truck on the Oregon Coast just 14 days into his mission.

Police in Lincoln City say 42-year-old Richard Swanson was hit on Tuesday morning while walking south along U.S. Highway 101 near the city limits.

He was declared dead at a hospital. The driver has not been charged and is said to be cooperating.

Tragic end: Richard Swanson, 42, from Seattle, was trying to dribble a soccer ball 10,000 miles to Brazil in time for the 2014 World Cup when he was struck and killed by a car in Oregon on Tuesday

Mission: Swanson set out on the trek on May 1 to promote the One World Futbol Project which donates durable soccer balls to people in developing countries

Lt. Jerry Palmer says investigators found materials among Swanson's things listing his website, BreakawayBrazil.com. They also found a blue soccer ball, similar to one he was frequently seen photographed with.

Swanson set out on the trek on May 1 to promote the One World Futbol Project, based in Berkley, Calif., which donates durable soccer balls to people in developing countries.

Along the way he documented his travel with a map, capturing his route, as well as photos of the sights he saw and people he met.

Among those immediately expressing their grief was Swanson's son, Devin Swanson, seen smiling in an earlier photograph along his trail with his father whom he called an 'inspiration to all to continue doing what you love.'

'He died doin what he loved and thats the only [consolation] I have,' Devin Swanson wrote on his Facebook page.

'I f***ing love you dad and I hope you're in a better place now. I would give anything and everything just to have one more day with you,' he wrote.

Others Swanson met along his journey - for shared meals and places of rest - also expressed both their appreciation for their time with him, however short, as well as their heartbreak.

'It was nice to meet such a wonderful man this weekend at our family BBQ,' one woman wrote on the BreakawayBrazil Facebook page.

Shared travels: Along the way Swanson documented his travel online, showing the places he slept, people he met, and sights he saw

'Saturday you walked hard and far to make it to my sons soccer game. You didn't know us before we invited you, yet you still made it your goal to make his soccer match. Thank you Richard for letting our family get to know you this weekend. We will never forget you.'

One World Futbol Project did not immediately respond to a call for comment. His project, BreakAwayBrazil, posted a message on their Facebook page expressing their shared loss:

‘His team, family, friends, and loved ones will miss him and love him dearly. You made it to Brazil in our hearts, Richard.’
