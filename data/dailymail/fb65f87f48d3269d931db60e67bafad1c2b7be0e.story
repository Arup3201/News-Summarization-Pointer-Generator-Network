Navy Pilot: Prince Andrew, pictured in 1982, said he was 'foolish' to think he was invincible

The Duke of York has spoken about his fear of dying in the Falklands after he was shot at by Argentine forces.

Prince Andrew said there were a ‘couple of times’ he feared not coming back home after carrying out dangerous missions while serving as a helicopter pilot.

He joined the Royal Navy in 1979 and served for 22 years, including the Falklands War in 1982.

Speaking to American television channel CNBC ahead of a charity initiative to help young entrepreneurs, he said he had been ‘very lucky’ to survive the conflict and admitted he had been ‘foolish’ to think he was ‘invincible’.

He added: ‘If you’ve been through those sorts of experiences you understand the frailty of life. And it’s not particularly nice being shot at and I can attest to that.

‘You look at life in a different way and you try to achieve more. I was very lucky to come back without having been shot down.

‘I have to say that afterwards I thought I was completely invincible and if anybody wanted to do it again, absolutely bring it on.

‘But I’ve realised the error of my ways now and I think that’s more foolish.’

When asked if there was a moment he thought he might not come home, he said: ‘Yeah probably a couple of times. But that’s normal.

‘One was being shot at, one was being missed by a missile which didn’t actually really arrive because it already hit somebody and the other one was trying to identify a ship at night.’

He said becoming a helicopter pilot was a ‘logical choice’ because it posed the ‘greatest intellectual challenge’ possible in the military.

Prince Andrew also talked about his good friendship with his former wife, Sarah, Duchess of York.

He said their relationship meant a ‘whole heap’ to the family and their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.

He said: ‘I just see it as illogical not to be a friend at the end of the day, regardless of what your set of circumstances are.’

He added the Duchess was a ‘fantastic mother’.

The Duke is currently working with American musician Will.i.am on an initiative called iDEA to support young digital entrepreneurs.

The interview, CNBC Meets HRH The Duke of York, is due to be broadcast on Wednesday at 10pm.
