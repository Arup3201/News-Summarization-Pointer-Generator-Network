Singer Ellie Goulding has found new romance with War Horse star Jeremy Irvine, and it's swiftly blossoming into a successful partnership – at least on ice.

Ellie, left, was spotted with the handsome actor, 22, at the opening of Somerset House's ice rink in London.

Although they were out as part of a larger group, the couple couldn't be torn away from each other.

'They were with a big bunch of friends but Jeremy and Ellie were inseparable,' says a spy. 'They skated around the rink in unison and barely left each other's side as they laughed and joked with one another. Jeremy was very tactile with Ellie and had his arm around her shoulders.'

It's the first relationship for Ellie, 25, since she broke up with dubstep producer Skrillex in September. She previously dated Radio 1 DJ Greg James.

Jeremy, pictured inset, was described as 'the next Christian Bale' after landing the starring role in Steven Spielberg's hit film last year.

Zoe Ball has emphatically left her wild days behind – she plans to be in bed by 9pm on her birthday. The Radio 2 presenter, once notorious for her party lifestyle, turns 42 on Friday and will be enjoying a teetotal celebration with DJ husband Norman Cook, 49, who has also reformed his ways.

'We have lots of friends coming over and we'll put on a few records,' said Zoe. 'I might not be awake past 9pm but they can carry on.'

She added: 'The only alcohol we have now is when we cook. We recently made Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's pumpkin soup, put a few drops of alcohol in it, and were like, “Whey-hey!” '

Jaime, right, daughter of hard-man actor Ray, split with photographer Tom Beard last month and it seems her attentions are once again directed towards the brother of singer Lily Allen. A friend said: 'Jaime was telling pals that Alfie is back on the scene.

They are very much back in touch and she is thrilled. If they decide to officially get back together, there will be wedding bells in no time.'

It seems Kate Moss has found herself a new friend in the shape of glamorous co-director of the Serpentine Gallery, Julia Peyton-Jones, OBE.

Guests at a party last week to celebrate the launch of the new Leon Max store in Westbourne Grove, West London, were surprised to find that 59-year-old Julia and Kate, 38, married to The Kills guitarist Jamie Hince, have become the best of friends since meeting on David Tang's yacht last summer.  

'Kate and I spent last summer on a boat going around Greece. I've spent a lot of time with her since – Jamie is such a nice man,' said Julia, who was seen enthusiastically dancing to Jamie's music at the party.
