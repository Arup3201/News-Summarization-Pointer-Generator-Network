Covered in dust, the paintwork is peeling and the engine won't run for long - but don't be fooled by its rugged condition, for this classic Jaguar is set to heat up the auction rooms when it goes under the hammer.

After spending the best part of 20 years rusting away in a barn on the continent, the Jaguar XK150 Drophead Coupe is far from looking how it did in its heyday.

In mint condition, the 1958 motor with a 3.4-litre engine developing 250bhp would have had a 0-60mph time of 7.8 seconds and a top speed of 132mph.

Bidding war: Although covered in rust and dust, this classic Jaguar is expected to attract a bidding war when it goes under the hammer

The car is regarded as one of the great British sports cars, thanks to its stylish looks and great performance.

It was returned to the UK about 18 months ago and the owner, who has kept it locked away, has now decided to sell it.

The engine starts, but the Jaguar is a non-runner and will require a full restoration.

Despite this, it is being offered with an estimated price of £45,000 - and if a pair of enthusiastic bidders battle it out, the price could run into six-figures. 

Jaguar barn finds are very desirable at the moment, with collectors buying them in a deteriorated state so they can be part of the restoration process.

Over the past two years a number of models have ended up selling for three or four times their estimates.

This Jaguar, thought to be the 67th XK150 built, will cross the auction block at the very first NEC Restoration Show on April 12th.

Paul Campbell, from Silverstone Auctions, said: 'It will need a full engine rebuild, the interior needs to be refurbished and the body will need to be stripped and repainted.

'It will make an interesting project.'
