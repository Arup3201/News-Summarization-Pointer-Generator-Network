Stoke manager Mark Hughes' attempts to sign Barcelona forward Adama Traore have been given the green light by the player's manager Eusebio Sacristan.

Hughes watched the Catalan club's second string at the weekend with a view to asking after Adama and his team-mate the striker Sandro. Barça B lost again and are now just one place and one point above the drop zone but it seems Barça B coach Eusebio is still open to the idea of players leaving.

He said: 'It is a question of talking to all parties. I wouldn't close any doors because it is no good having players here whose heads are elsewhere'.

The comment was understood to refer to speedy winger Adama who has already starred and scored for the Barcelona first team in the Copa del Rey this season. 

He turned 19 on Sunday and the club believe he could progress to the first team as early as next season but that does not rule out a loan move now.

With former Barcelona players Bojan Krkic and Marc Muniesa at the club Hughes would like to add to his Camp Nou contingent and has also looked at Sandro who has already scored for the first team in the league. Sandro seems less keen to force his way out and is likely to remain in Spain.

It is vitally important that Barcelona stay in the second division in Spain because of the drop in quality from the second division to the four regional divisions in the third tier. 

With another defeat at the weekend Barça B continued to plummit and Eusebio's job is on the line but that does not appeared to have ended Stoke's chances of landing Adama.
