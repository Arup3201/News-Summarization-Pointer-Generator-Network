Neil Kinnock's son, Stephen Kinnock, is the latest Labour heir to stand for Parliament after he was selected to as the party's candidate to fight a safe seat.

The son of the former Labour leader will stand in 2015 for the seat in Aberavon, which the party has continuously held since the 1920s.

Kinnock, 44, has worked for the British Council and World Economic Forum, and is married to Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who recently hit the news because of her selfie with U.S. President Barack Obama and PM David Cameron.

Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Danish Prime Minister, waves to supporters with her husband Stephen Kinnock from the front door of her home in Copenhagen after the result of Denmark's parliamentary election. Kinnock will now be standing for parliament 1000 miles away from his wife in a move towards Westminster

His mother is Lady Glenys Kinnock, a former Labour MEP.

Kinnock will be standing for the seat following the departure of the current MP Hywel Francis.

Francis announced last November said he would not be seeking a re-election.

In the 2010 general election, Francis won in Aberavon with a majority of more than 11,000.

Stephen is not the only one of the 
Kinnock family to work in Labour politics, as his sister Rachel was a 
member of staff for the political office of Gordon Brown during his 
stint in Number 10.

Mr
 Kinnock, who has been dubbed the 'Red Prince' by the press, is not the 
only Labour heir to make a move on a safe political seat.

Tony Blair's son, Euan Blair, has been active on the political radar as a Labour campaigner, and has been rumoured to be running for a safe Labour seat in Coventry in 2015.

This move towards Westminster was signalled after he left a highly paid job at investment bank Morgan Stanley to work for a managerial post with a Coventry-based recruitment agency, which is involved in the Governmentâ€™s work programme.

This move came as a safe Labour seat is almost free, as the MP for Coventry North East, former defence secretary Bob Ainsworth, announced he was leaving in 2015.

The constituency was created in 1974, and has been under Labour representation ever since.

William Straw, son of Labour grandee Jack, has announced his candidacy for the current Conservative seat of Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire.

The seat is directly adjacent to Jack Straw's constituency of Blackburn, the seat he has held since 1979.

Another family at the top of the Labour party are Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper, two of the most senior figures in the current shadow cabinet as shadow chancellor and shadow home secretary.

The pair made history as the first married couple to serve in the British Cabinet at the same time, during Labour's last term in office.

Labour Leader Ed Miliband and his brother, former Labour party leader hopefull David Miliband, ran against each other for the leadership of the party

The Miliband family meanwhile are linked fraternally, and made waves in the party when Labour leader Ed Miliband and his brother David were at odds fighting for leadership of the party.

Their father Ralph was a prominent left-wing academic, and both Ed and David eventually ended up in senior positions in the Labour party.
