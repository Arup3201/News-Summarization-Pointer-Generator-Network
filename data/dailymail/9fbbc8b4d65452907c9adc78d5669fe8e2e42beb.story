If you find yourself worrying about germs a lot, you’re far from alone.

As many as 7.3million of Britons claim to be more concerned about them than they used to be, and one in six worries about their presence in the home, a survey has revealed.

Fear of harmful microbes has also led almost half the population (46 per cent) to use antibacterial handwash regularly and 16 per cent to carry it with them.

It seems that along with growing ownership of electronic gadgets we could be developing a fresh obsession: tech hygiene.

Last year as many as three in ten Britons said they would consider using a special cleaner or polish for mobiles, laptops, tablet computers and MP3 players.

Significantly 70 per cent of people opting for more powerful cleaning products – an increase of 9 per cent in a year, market researchers Mintel found.

British homes had the most (13 per cent) of household products claiming to be antibacterial – higher than in other European countries.

The ubiquity of touch-screen technology, caused by increasing numbers of tablet and Apple products on the market, means more people are now worrying about phone cleaning.

The survey estimates that almost six in 10 (56per cent) own a smartphone and 31per cent own a portable media player.

It also finds that 70 per cent of people are opting for more powerful cleaning products - an increase of nine per cent in the space of a year.

The UK was also the country with the most (13per cent) household products claiming to be antibacterial - much higher than in other European countries.

Richard Caines, Senior Household Care Analyst at Mintel, which carried out the research, said: ‘Spring cleaning is a priority for many this bank holiday and with the warmer weather and longer and lighter days, this is certainly a good time of the year for the promotion of new cleaning products.

‘A clean home environment improves people’s sense of well-being and reduces anxiety, even more so at a time when incomes are being squeezed and less money is available for going out.

‘Although some people think that as a nation we are becoming too obsessed about hygiene, manufacturers still have a big opportunity to market cleaning products focused on protecting and caring for the home and family, something that has resonance with consumers.’
