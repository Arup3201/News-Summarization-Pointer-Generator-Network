She's married to a Hollywood heartthrob, graces the most star-studded parties and has a roster of A-list friends, but Blake Lively proves she's a down-to-earth girl at heart in her latest beauty campaign.

Smouldering as the face of Gucci Premiere, the pregnant actress shares her festive regime, traditions and memories - and Christmas in the Lively household a far less lavish affair than you may have imagined.

Speaking about her favourite time of the year, the 27-year-old said: 'Christmas for me is all about spending time with my family. I cherish any chance we have to spend all day together making gingerbread houses, baking cookies, or sitting around and watching movies.'

Blake, who grew up in Los Angeles in a large brood, opened up about her childhood and the nostalgia that Christmas brings.

'Growing up in California, lighting seasonal candles were the only way we are able to experience winter because we had no snow or change of seasons,' she said. 'The smell of pine needles, spruce and the smell of a Christmas tree - those to me, are the scents of the holidays.'

The actress, who shot to fame as Serena van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl, revealed her favourite holiday movie is Holiday Inn with Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire. 'It’s such an amazing film! I also love It’s A Wonderful Life and those Claymation movies too. I haven’t outgrown them,' she said.

She may have an enviable figure and will no doubt snap back to her pre-baby body with ease, but Blake has admitted that one of her favourite festive foods is home-baked cookies.

'My dad actually makes the best cookies,' she said of her favoured sweet treat. 'My mum is great baker too but doesn’t share them - it’s tantalising! Luckily for me though, my dad shares his!'.

Charitable as ever, Blake explains that when you purchase a  fragrance, Gucci will make a donation through Chime Or Change to any organisation of your choosing benefiting women’s health, education and justice. Blake has long supported Chime For Change, along with Beyonce and Eva Longoria.

'It’s the perfect way to give back while also giving a loved one a gift. It’s a gift that keeps on giving,' she added.

Blake also published her first holiday gift guide on her new blog last week, and it's every bit as bohemian as the Gossip Girl star herself.

Gifted: Blake  unveiled her gift guide on Preserve and included mysterious 'dreaming oil'

Among the presents she recommends on her Preserve website for a 'foodie' loved one is an organic spiced cocoa mix, which costs more than £20.

Also on the list is the ever-so mysterious 'dreaming oil', which promises 'a serenading melody in every drop'. 

Blake, who is expecting her first baby with husband Ryan Reynolds next year, isn't letting pregnancy get in the way of her work commitments.

The  actress was positively glowing as she stepped out at the L'Oreal Paris' Ninth Annual Women Of Worth Celebration in New York City on Tuesday, proudly showing off her baby bump in a clinging black evening gown.

Blake was named as a new face of L'Oreal last October and joined the likes of Julianne Moore and Eva Longoria at the bash.

Blake may be lauded as one of the world's most beautiful women, which is obvious from this shoot and her red carpet appearance on Tuesday, but even she has pangs of insecurity.

'Glamour is very much a state of mind. There were points early on in my life when I wanted to look like someone else, or I dressed in a way that wasn’t necessarily representative of who I was,' she said. 

'But,' she continues, 'I learned very quickly that style and confidence has to come from within. It’s what makes you feel your most graceful, elegant and empowered self.

'You can be glamorous in jeans and a T-shirt or you can have it dressed up in your finest. It’s really about finding that woman that you want to be.'
