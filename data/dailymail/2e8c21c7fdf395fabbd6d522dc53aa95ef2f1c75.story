Nearly four decades since its last episode aired on the BBC, Dad’s Army could come to the big screen with a shocking twist - Captain Mainwaring might be played by a woman.

Co-writer Jimmy Perry revealed to the classic sitcom’s official appreciation club that a new film version is in the early stages of development, but the surprise role change has gone down badly with fans.

Mr Perry, 89, who wrote the series with the late David Croft, is said to be in ‘disbelief’ - and as most of the original cast are now dead, fans are anxious for scriptwriters to stick to the genre of the series.

At-tention! The original was filmed in Thetford, Norfolk, where the fictional Walmington-on-Sea branch of the Home Guard was based. Arthur Lowe (left), who played Captain Mainwaring, died in 1982

Much-loved: Dad's Army, which followed volunteers in a Home Guard platoon, ran from 1968 to 1977

Women were allowed from 1943 into the 
Home Guard - formerly known as the Local Defence Volunteers - but a
female Home Guard captain would have been very unlikely, experts say.

Limited female involvement was permitted from 1943 but the roles were mostly non-combatant with duties including cooking and office work.

The LDV was formed when there was a 
high chance of invasion during the Second World War, with Sir Anthony Eden calling on the radio in 
May 1940 for 'men of all ages who wish to do something for the defence 
of their country’.

It was 
renamed the Home Guard by prime minister Winston Churchill in 
July 1940 and 1.5million men had 
volunteered by the end of the month to operate the defence system.

It comes after Clive Dunn, who played
Lance Corporal Jack Jones and was famous for the phrase ‘Don't panic!’,
died last week aged 92. Arthur Lowe, who played Captain Mainwaring, 
died in 1982.

The original was filmed in Thetford, 
Norfolk, where the fictional Walmington-on-Sea branch of the Home Guard 
was based - and the manager of the town’s Dad’s Army Museum is furious 
at the plans.

‘We’re talking about an iconic series that was written by two geniuses,’ Corinne Fulford, 47, told the Independent. ‘I can’t even imagine how he could be played by a woman.’

A
Dad’s Army Appreciation Society spokesman said Mr Perry revealed plans 
‘to a room of surprised DAAS members’ last month  - but he won’t be 
writing the script so could not reveal the storyline.

The spokesman said there were ‘groans’ 
when Mr Perry showed his ‘disbelief’ while saying the film company ‘have
hinted that they want the lead role of Mainwaring to be played by a 
woman’.

Dad’s Army, which followed a Home Guard platoon, ran from 1968 to 1977. Women who have been cited to play the new Captain Mainwaring include Miranda Hart, Prunella Scales and Sue Perkins.

Mr Perry is in the middle of talks but no film studio is attached. It would not be the first Dad’s Army film - after a 1971 version was produced by Columbia Studios featuring the original cast.

Dad’s Army expert David Brooks, 53, suggested the film could seek to tap into a new generation of the show's fans, as many teenagers visit the Thetford museum - only open on Saturdays.

‘As long as they were loyal to the 
genre of the comedy series, fans would be fine about it,’ he told the 
Independent. ‘But I’m not sure whether a woman Mainwaring would go down 
very well.’
