She shot to fame on Made In Chelsea as the resident fashionista with a penchant for pink hair, nose rings and cutting comments - most of which were directed at Lucy Watson.

So it comes as no surprise that Phoebe-Lettice Thompson has chanelled her creativity into her own fashion range.

The 23-year-old, who worked on Tatler's fashion desk during her time on the E4 show, has teamed up with London label Illustrated People to create her 22-piece debut range.

Cool vibes: Phoebe-Lettice Thompson, who found 
fame on Made In Chelsea, has designed a collection with Illustrated 
People but refrained from modelling it herself because 'that would be 
naff,' she says

Speaking to MailOnline about her 'easy and accessible' new collection, which ranges in price from £35-£65, Phoebe said: 'The inspiration stems from my fascination with the vibrant Tokyo fashion scene and the Harajuku girls living there.

'I love Gwen Stefani's style, it really resonates with me so I channelled it into this range.'

Far east: Phoebe's self-styled campaign was shot in East London, where she hunted for 'badass' models to be her clothes horses

Phoebe's urban-inspired collection is filled with gingham co-ords, masculine shorts and chic 90s silhouettes.

'I've combined the random, the good with the bad, to get something quite strange,' she says of the range, which juxtaposes grotesque imagery such as bloody eyeballs with pretty pastels.

Unlike 
many celebrities, who simply put their name to a brand, Phoebe, who 
began working in a couture house at 16, maintains that she has done 
everything herself. 'I'm totally confident, I know how it works so they 
let me do exactly what I wanted,' she explained.

Speaking
 about her personal style, Phoebe, who cites Moschino, Balmain and 
Meadham Kirchhoff as her go-to labels, said: 'My dress sense is weird. I
 dress how I feel and I love wearing pieces that no one else has.

Creative control: Unlike many celebrities, who simply put their name to a brand, Phoebe did everything herself from scouting the models to shooting the campaign

Cool kids: Phoebe chose models who 'are hot but would beat you up' to model her urban range

'I think clothes are a really good talking point and can be an ice breaker. When I was younger, I was such a cyber goth. My mother wouldn't let me dye my hair.'

Phoebe, who loves shopping on eBay and in Topshop, cites Paris Hilton, Azealia Banks and Angel Haze as her style icons and says that she'd love to see 'cool girls' like Jourdan Dunn wearing her clothes.

She refrained from modelling herself because, she says, 'I'm not a model and it would be naff if I did it.' Instead, she scoured East London for some really 'badass' models, the type who 'are hot but would beat you up,' she says.

Inspired: Phoebe used The 'Kawaii' - a distinct Japanese theme meaning cute - as her inspiration and had everything shipped over from Japan

Avid Made In Chelsea fans will notice that Phoebe is distinctly absent this season. 'I left at the end of season six because I wanted to concentrate on my career,' she revealed.

Speaking about her plans for the future, she added: 'I like being freelance because it gives me freedom and I really enjoy brand and creative direction. I'd love my own line, that would be the dream.

'I thought it was so unattainable but I'm so keen.'
