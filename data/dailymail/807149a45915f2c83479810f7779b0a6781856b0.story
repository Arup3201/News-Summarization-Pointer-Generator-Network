The man accused of killing a mother and her 14-year-old daughter carried out the gruesome crime to kidnap the woman's two youngest daughters, with whom he is now on the run, his wife has claimed.

A massive manhunt is underway for Adam Mayes, 35, who allegedly abducted Alexandria Bain, 12, and Kyliyah Bain, eight, last week. He has been charged with the murders of their mother and sister.

His wife, Teresa Mayes, who lived with Mayes and his parents in their trailer in Guntown, Mississippi, has also been charged with two counts of first-degree murder - as she lifted the lid on their motive.

'Family friend': Adam Mayes with Adrienne Bain, who he is alleged to have killed along with her mother, and her sister Alexandria. Mayes's wife has now said Adam's motive was to kidnap the two youngest Bain girls

She told police she was present on April 27 when her husband killed Jo Ann Bain and her daughter Adrienne in a garage at their Whiteville, Tennessee, home, according to an affidavit.

She added that the motive was to kidnap Bain's two younger daughters.

It comes a day after Teresa Mayes was charged with especially aggravated kidnapping after she admitted she drove her husband, the girls and the two bodies from southwest Tennessee.

When back home in Guntown, she saw Adam Mayes dig a hole in the yard, she told police. The bodies of Jo Ann and Alexandria Bain were found buried at the property a week later.

Adam Mayes's mother, Mary Mayes, 65, was also charged with four counts of conspiracy 
to commit especially aggravated kidnapping on Tuesday.

She told police she heard digging outside her home - believed to be when her son was digging the graves - but did not alert authorities. Both women have been jailed in Tennessee.

On Wednesday, it also emerged that 
Adam Mayes was spotted in a convenience store in Union County, 
Mississippi on July 30 - about three days after the family went missing.

In grainy footage released by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, Mayes can be seen in the County Line One Market on 
Highway 348 in Guntown with shorter hair.

Owner Nick Barghouthi said he commented on Mayes' shorter hair and the suspect acknowledged it.

The TBI have said he may have also 
altered the appearance of the two missing girls, Alexandra Bain, 12, and
Kyliyah Bain, eight, by cutting or dying their hair.

Also on Wednesday, Mayes's sister-in-law Bobbi Booth pleaded with the fugitive via CNN to 'do the right thing and just let the children go'.

The bodies of Jo Ann and Adrienne Bain were found buried at the Guntown property and identified by authorities. The FBI has not said how the woman and her daughter died.

Taken: Eight-year-old Kyliyah, left, and her sister Alexandria, 
12, right, are still believed to be with Mayes

FBI spokesman Joel Siskovic told The 
Associated Press on Tuesday: 'We're still working on the belief that the
youngest two daughters are 
alive. We're still hopeful.'

Also speaking to AP, Teresa
Mayes' sister, Bobbi Booth, said her sister told her last week that she
knew about the killings, but Booth thinks she was too scared to call 
the police.

Booth told 
her sister to call the police and was assured that she had, but by 
Saturday Booth had become suspicious about that claim and called police 
herself.

'I told them 
exactly what she had told me: Who the bodies were, where they could be 
dug from,' Booth said - although investigators had begun digging the 
garden the previous day.

Investigation: FBI agents search the backyard of Adam Mayes's Mississippi home, where he lived with his parents

Search: The FBI gathers officers for a briefing. The bodies of Jo Ann and Adrienne Bain were found at the home

Fears: The FBI, which searched the area surrounding the trailer, thinks Mayes has changed his appearance

She said that Teresa Mayes had expressed fears that her husband was having an affair with Jo Ann.

But Booth added that she finds it 
hard to believe Adam Mayes could kill a child, especially as he seemed 
'like a big happy family' with the Bains parents and their children.

'I have cried until I'm sick,' she 
said. 'I was totally shocked. I've known him since I was little. We 
played together when we were kids. I always thought he was odd, but I 
never dreamed he'd do this.'

Booth said she has not had much contact with her sister for the past 11 years as Adam Mayes stood in the way. 'He was very aggressive with her, abusive,' she said.

FBI agents wearing green camouflage and carrying high-powered rifles swarmed the woods and back roads of north Mississippi near Mayes' home, joined by K-9 units and SWAT teams.

Troopers stopped vehicles and looked 
in trunks on Monday, while FBI agents continued to search the garden of 
the house where Adam Mayes lived with his wife and his parents.

Bain's husband reported the four missing from their rural Tennessee home April 27.

Mayes, a longtime friend of Bain's 
husband, had stayed over at the family's house to help them pack and 
load up a U-Haul to drive across the country to Arizona, authorities 
said.

Gary Bain, who was at the house that night, awoke to find his wife, daughters and Mayes gone.

He couldn't reach his wife on her cell phone that day, and reported them missing when the girls didn't get off the school bus.

Mayes was last seen a week ago in Guntown, about 80 miles south of the Bain family's home.

Both Gary Bain and Mayes were once married to sisters, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Kristin Helm said.

Jo Ann Bain's aunt said she was waiting for authorities to tell her that her niece and the girls are safe.

Victims: The Hardeman County Sheriff's Department said Jo Ann Bain, far right, and daughters Adrienne, 14; Alexandria, 12; and Kyliyah, 8; had been missing since April 27

Family: Adam Mayes's wife told police she drove the mother and her three daughters, pictured, to Mississippi

'I pray for Jo Ann and the girls to be OK and for them to come home,' said Beverly Goodman, who works at Whiteville City Hall.

She said that her niece was not the type of woman to run off with someone.

Linda Kirkland, a family friend and 
cook at the Country Cafe in Whiteville, said the woman and her daughters
were moving to Arizona because two of the girls had asthma.

'Jo Ann and the kids, everyone loves them. We're just hoping to hear that they're safe,' she said.

Siskovic, the FBI spokesman, said 
authorities talked to Mayes early on in the investigation, but he fled 
when they tried to contact him again.

Mayes also has ties to Arizona, Texas,
North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. He may be using the aliases
of Christopher Zachery Wylde or Paco Rodrigass.

Investigation: Police believe family friend Christopher Mayes abducted them and may have forced the family to cut and dye their hair to conceal their identities

Warrant: As the search continues a warrant for Mayes has been issued after he provided a false report to investigators before disappearing himself

While authorities say Mayes is likely 
to be armed and extremely dangerous, acquaintances describe him as 
friendly, helpful and like an uncle to the girls.

Gerald Long, 60, of Jackson, 
Tennessee, said he last saw Mayes about two years ago. He said Mayes 
lived across the street from him for about a year with his wife, Teresa.
He described Mayes as a 'sociable person.' He was helpful, Long said. 'He didn't seem violent or anything.'

As for his relationship with his wife, Long said 'they were always up and down about things.' Long would not elaborate but he said he thought Mayes and his wife are no longer together.

Authorities said Alexandria has brown 
hair and hazel eyes and is 5 feet tall and 105 pounds. Kyliyah has blond
hair and brown eyes and is 4 feet tall and 57 pounds.
