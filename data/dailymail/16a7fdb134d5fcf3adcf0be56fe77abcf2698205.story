An influential group of doctors and surgeons will declare today that the NHS must accept the 'unpalatable truth' and start charging patients for services it can no longer afford.

The group will demand that a list is drawn 
up to tell patients what 'core' services they can expect from the NHS and what 'extras' they will have to pay for.

Under proposals due to be  put before the  British Medical Association's annual meeting in Edinburgh, members will be told that the service can no longer be 'free-at-the-point-of-contact'.

A motion due to be put forward by the organisation's Buckinghamshire division will say: 'This meeting requests the BMA to launch a debate with the public 
and the health professions about what type of health service they wish 
for in the future and how it could be delivered in a climate of 
shrinking resources.'

A further motion by the Conference of LMCs agenda committee, the body that represents local NHS GPs, adds: 'This meeting believes that the government has a full and frank discussion with the public on how to fund the NHS if it is to remain free at the point of care.'

It goes on to say: 'It is time for conference to face the unpalatable truth that free at the point of contact can no longer be sustained.'

The Yorkshire Regional Council also warned: 'New NHS services must be fully priced before introduction and a recommendation made about what is stopped to pay for this new work, unless additional money is made available.'

But unions and patients' groups warned that top-up payments were 'contrary to the whole ethos of the NHS'  and could be the start of a slippery slope towards privatisation of health services.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, told The Times that means-testing and top-up charges were contrary to the ethos of the NHS.

Under pressure: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is due to release his spending review on Wednesday

Opposition: Unions and patients' groups have warned that top-up payments were 'contrary to the whole ethos of the NHS'

She said: 'Do you ask people to pay for hospital food? What happens to people who can't pay for it? Who is in a position to say, "You can't have this operation unless you pay for it yourself".

'We do have to have a grown-up conversation with regard to co-payments and top-ups. But with scandal after scandal in the NHS the public wants us to address those now.

'Unless care is made better, we cut down on waste and the public sees the NHS putting its house in order I don't think it is the time for that conversation.'

Rehana Azam, of the GMB union, added: 'The NHS should stick with the principle that access should be available to all and should not be on the ability to pay. If you start going down the route of what you can't have and what you have to top up then where do you stop?'

It comes two days before the government's spending review is due to be published with Chancellor George Osborne under pressure to make cuts.

He has promised to ring-fence the £110billion health budget and promised to 'prioritise' spending on the NHS.

In a video warning of 'tough choices'
in the spending review which will set out £11.5billion of cuts for 
2015-16, Mr Osborne said: 'We will look after those who need our help 
but make sure benefits do not go up faster than wages.

'We have already decided to spend an 
extra £3billion on the country's infrastructure. Things like roads, 
bridges, railways and HS2. These are key for future jobs.

'And we will prioritise spending on the NHS and schools - vital public services that we depend on.'
