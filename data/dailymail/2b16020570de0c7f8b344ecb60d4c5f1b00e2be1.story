Brett Jones was used to making tough dives and dropping into dangerous territories as a Navy SEAL but his most harrowing mission came when he left a message for his boyfriend

A former Navy SEAL has revealed how by accidentally ending a voicemail to his boyfriend by saying 'I love you' led to the end of his military career.

Brett Jones was a part of the elite military unit nearly a decade before the 'Don't Ask Don't Tell' policy was lifted, allowing military servicemen and women to serve while being open about their sexuality.

In 2002, Jones had just returned from his second deployment and on the morning after his welcome home party, Jones called the fellow Navy serviceman who threw him the party.

Jones left a voicemail thanking the 
man- who he had secretly been dating- and accidentally said 'I love you'
 at the end of the message.

When the man got home and listened to the message, a female colleague was in the room with him.

That woman reported what she heard to her superior and it worked its way up the chain-of-command.

'That was all it took for the Navy to launch a full-scale investigation that lasted for months,' Jones told ABC News.

At
 the end of the investigation, the Navy evidentally didn't like what 
they found because they pulled his security clearance and 'treated me 
like I was a criminal,' Jones said.

'It was one of the most difficult times of my life...It was so damn humiliating,' he told ABC.

On the outs: After a colleague of his boyfriend's overheard a private message, she told her superiors and he became the subject of a months-long investigation

The Navy honorably discharged Jones in 2003 and a spokesman would not comment on his allegations about the investigation.

Jones recently penned an essay about his time in the Navy SEALs for SOFREP, a site dedicated to military news and stories that takes its name from the code for Special Operations Forces Sitations.

He wrote how he reluctantly spun a web of lies to keep his brothers-in-arms from finding out about his social life.

He recalled an instance when he got a call from a man named Mike who he had met the night before at a gay bar, and how he desperately wanted to see the man again but would have to come up with multiple excuses to keep it from his peers.

'I absolutely hated it when I did that,' he said of lying to the other SEALs in his company.

'Second, I was going to lie to Mike, because there is no way in hell I was going to tell him truthfully what I did and who I worked for. I’m not proud of the lies, but living under the rule of DADT left me few options in such a small close-knit community.'

Support: Jones was honorably discharged in June 2003 but said that the majority of his fellow SEALs were supportive of him during that difficult time

Mr Jones' is not the first to go through such hurdles in order to keep two parts of his life- his sexuality and his service- separate from one another.

The 2011 repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell made it legally safer for military servicemen and women to serve openly, but he said that the majority of the Navy SEALs from his company were supportive of him.

'Eventually, I was forced out of the closet to my SEAL team, and I discovered that it was not as bad as I had made it in my mind. Sure, there were guys who would whisper and talk behind my back, but overall my SEAL brothers supported me. For that, I will always be thankful,' Jones wrote.

'It was because of that support, from my brothers, that I could proudly say, “My name is Brett Jones, I am a Navy SEAL, and I am gay.”'
