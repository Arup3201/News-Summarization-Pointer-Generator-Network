England

FULL BACK

Mike Brown - 7/10

Age: 29 Caps: 28

Had a crucial kick charged down last week. Not enjoying the form he has previously shown in the white jersey.

WING

Anthony Watson - 7.5

Age: 20 Caps: 0

Been waiting in the wings for a while now. A debut opposite Springbok legend Bryan Habana beckons.

CENTRE

Brad Barritt - 7.5

Age: 28 Caps: 17

Another solid defensive shift against New Zealand. Does exactly what he says on the tin and should get more credit for his ball skills.

CENTRE

Kyle Eastmond - 7

Age: 25 Caps: 4

Kicking game exposed last week but moments of magic in attack. How much will be left in the tank after his illness?

WING

Jonny May - 8

Age 24 Caps: 8

Finally delivered on the big stage with his memorably try against the All Blacks. Now time to kick on.

FLY-HALF

Owen Farrell - 6.5

Age: 23 Caps: 26

Failed to unlock the All Blacks defence. Always committed, putting his body on the line in defence and accurate from the tee.

SCRUM-HALF

Danny Care - 7

Age: 27 Caps: 49

Hoping to mark his 50th cap with a memorable afternoon. Sharp around the edges but box-kicking game is not up to standards.

PROP

Joe Marler - 6.5

Age: 24 Caps: 22

Solid enough last week and put in a good defensive shift. But England’s scrum improved with new front row.

HOOKER

Dylan Hartley - 7.5

Age: 28 Caps: 57

Excellent in the set-piece and offered his usual niggle. Has to prove that speculation over a move to France is not a distraction.

PROP

David Wilson - 6.5

Age: 29 Caps: 38

Carried well and recovered from huge collision with Sonny Bill Williams. Again, English scrum enhanced by reinforcements.

SECOND ROW

Dave Attwood - 8.5

Age: 27 Caps: 12

Looking to make the shirt his own. More than just an enforcer, made his presence felt in every facet of the game last week.

SECOND ROW

Courtney Lawes - 7

Age: 25 Caps: 31

Little chance to impose himself against New Zealand after suffering first half head injury. Missed a crucial tackle in the build up to first try.

BLINDSIDE

Tom Wood - 7

Age: 28 Caps: 29

Did not have a huge impact against the All Blacks. Will have to be at his defensive best to chop down opposite number Marcell Coetzee.

NO 8

Billy Vunipola - 7

Age: 22 Caps: 11

Will relish the physical challenge against the Springboks. Needs to prove that he has the engine for international rugby.

OPENSIDE

Chris Robshaw (capt) - 8

Age: 28 Caps: 29

Topped the tackle count last week. Leads by example and has again silenced his critics.

Substitutes: Rob Webber, Matt Mullan, Kieran Brookes, George Kruis, Ben Morgan, Ben Youngs, George Ford, Marland Yarde

TOTAL: 107.5/150 

South Africa

FULL BACK 

Willie le Roux 9/10

Age: 25 Caps: 22

Had Wales on toast in the summer. Nominated for IRB Player of the Year but made uncharacteristic mistakes against Ireland.

WING 

JP Pietersen 7

Age: 28 Caps: 57

The World Cup winner returns to the Springbok line-up to add some valuable experience. Has played full-back so better suited to a kicking game.

CENTRE 

Jan Serfontein 7.5

Age: 21 Caps: 17

A former IRB Junior Player of the Year. His physical approach in both attack and defence have made the youngster a Springbok regular.

CENTRE 

Jean de Villiers 7

Age: 33 Caps: 103

The wise head in South Africa’s back-line. His partnership with Serfontein is still a work in progress.

WING 

Bryan Habana 7.5

Age: 31 Caps: 104

Averages more than a score in every two games on the international stage. Always within sniffing distance of the try line.

FLY-HALF 

Pat Lambie 6.5

Age: 24 Caps: 37

Replaces young tyro Handre Pollard at No 10. He has more experience than the youngster and a more developed kicking game.

SCRUM-HALF 

Cobus Reinach 6.5

Age: 24 Caps: 3

His first start in the Springbok jersey. Incumbent of the shirt following a poor show from Francois Hougaard and injuries to Fourie du Preez and Ruan Pienaar.

PROP 

Tendai Mtawarira 7

Age: 29 Caps: 62

His solid scrummaging was one of the positives from the defeat to Ireland. ‘The Beast’ is also known for his carrying skills.

HOOKER 

Adriaan Strauss 7

Age: 28 Caps: 41

Physical and abrasive player who will relish a confrontation with Hartley. Discipline cost him a yellow card last week.

PROP 

Jannie du Plessis 7.5

Age: 31 Caps: 61

Has started every Test for the Springboks in 2014. The cornerstone in the Springbok scrum, which prides itself on physicality.

SECOND ROW 

Eben Etzebeth 8

Age: 23 Caps: 30

One of the brightest young locks in world rugby. Intimidates veterans well above his age.

SECOND ROW 

Victor Matfield 8

Age: 37 Caps: 118

Age is only a number. Some ridiculed his return to international rugby but he has proved wrong all of his doubters.

BLINDSIDE 

Marcell Coetzee 7

Age: 23 Caps: 23

A flanker who can play on both sides of the scrum. South Africa are effectively playing with two opensides.

NO 8 

Duane Vermeulen 8

Age: 28 Caps: 26

Often leads the ball carrying statistics for his country. A hugely powerful runner and one of the game’s leading players in his position.

OPENSIDE 

Schalk Burger 7.5

Age: 31 Caps: 74

Returned from a career and life-threatening case of bacterial meningitis last September. A fierce operator and a nuisance at the breakdown.

Substitutes: Bismarck du Plessis, Trevor Nyakane, Coenie Oosthuizen, Bakkies Botha, Teboho Mohoje, Francois Hougaard, Handre Pollard, Cornal Hendricks.

TOTAL: 111/150
