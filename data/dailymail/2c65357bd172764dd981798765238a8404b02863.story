Ryan Taylor had not played a competitive match since August, 2012 but returned to action at the Etihad. The Newcastle utility man has spent the past 26 months on the treatment table, in the gym, in the swimming pool, even in the stands scouting – anywhere but a football field. 

Two cruciate-ligament injuries have been the cause of his absence but Taylor’s smile was wider than anyone else during the warm-up and his beam got even bigger after his challenge laid on the opening goal for Rolando Aarons after just seven minutes.

Toon break CITY hoodoo

It is fair to say that City have had the Indian sign over Newcastle of late. In the previous 17 meetings between the pair they had been unbeaten, winning 15 of those matches. You have to go back to a Michael Owen goal in 2005 for the last time the Toon triumphed. 

The Magpies had never won at the Etihad and, while we’ re at it, it was City who proved their conquerors at this stage last season, winning 2-0 after extra-time at St James’ Park. It just goes to show, history only counts for so much.

No silva lining for Pellegrini

David Silva might have been forgiven for wondering why he was even involved, for the City playmaker hasn’t had much of a rest recently. Having started the previous six matches – including last week’s trek to Moscow – Silva was a surprise inclusion given the proximity of the Manchester derby. 

And Manuel Pellegrini paid the price with the Spaniard lasting just seven minutes before succumbing to Ryan Taylor’s early challenge. Silva has missed just one game all season – the third-round tie at home to Sheffield Wednesday – so to see him included against an under-strength Newcastle appeared somewhat needless.

Louis van Gaal was not present to check on City ahead of Sunday’s Manchester derby. Instead, the United boss sent trusted lieutenant Marcel Bout to run the rule over their neighbours.

Perhaps the Dutch boss has done his scouting over the television, for last night’s transmission was the 12th time from 15 matches that they have been broadcast live this season. 

Van Gaal would no doubt have enjoyed the sight of City struggling to handle a strikeforce which cost a combined £3m – wait until Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie are unleashed this weekend…
