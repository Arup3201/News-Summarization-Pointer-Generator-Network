Two Italian sisters who worked for  Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi during their marriage were yesterday in court accused of stealing almost £700,000 from the pair.

Astonishingly, the couple’s suspicions were aroused only when the women’s expenditure on household credit cards rocketed from £10,000 to £50,000 a month, the court heard.

It is claimed Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo had been lavishly spending for years – on everything from expensive hotels and designer shopping to costly flights and taxi journeys – before they were rumbled.

At first Miss Lawson and Mr Saatchi 
were willing to keep employing the sisters while they paid the money 
back, but called the police when the girls rejected the offer. Francesca
 even told Mr Saatchi ‘it would be humiliating to live in the house on 
less pay and she would rather go to jail’.

Opening
 the £685,000 case, prosecutor Jane Carpenter QC told a jury of five 
women and seven men at Isleworth crown court in west London that the 
case was not about Mr Saatchi’s claims his ex-wife was a cocaine addict,
 but about ‘fraud motivated by greed’.

Evidence': Charles Saatchi, 70, (pictured) is expected to give prosecution evidence against his two former employees tomorrow. His ex-wife Nigella is likely to enter the witness stand on Friday

Miss
 Carpenter said: ‘This trial relates to the high life lived by Francesca
 and Elisabetta Grillo – the sort of life you may often see portrayed in
 glossy magazines.

‘We say 
they did so in a greedy and fraudulent free-for-all, abusing the trust 
of their employers in a four-year spending spree.’ Miss Carpenter 
claimed Francesca, 35, was the biggest fraudster over the four years, 
racking up bills totalling £580,000, while Elisabetta, 41, accounted for
 £105,000. Each woman denies a single count of fraud.

The pair were previously housed for free by their employers but now live together in Central London after being sacked.

Drug claims: Nigella Lawson's former workers will make allegations about her alleged drug use, the jury was told today

They
 were initially employed by Miss Lawson, described in court as ‘a 
cookery writer’, to ‘ensure the smooth running’ of the household and 
help with the children.

Francesca was paid £28,000 a year and had worked
 for the couple for a decade, while her sister began working for Miss 
Lawson and her late husband John Diamond 14 years ago and was paid 
£25,000.

Both were provided 
with Coutts credit cards in their own names on Mr Saatchi’s Conarco 
company account.

It was made clear, the prosecutor said, that these were
 not for personal purchases unless agreed by Miss Lawson or Mr Saatchi.

But
 the court heard how in June 2012, Mr Saatchi’s company accountant Rahul
 Gajjar investigated spending on both cards and found the bills had 
risen from ‘£10,000-£20,000 a month to £50,000 a month’.

The
 investigation found there had been large sums spent on long taxi 
journeys and in luxury shops such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu and 
Prada. Miss Carpenter said: ‘There was also regular large cash 
withdrawals which made Mr Gajjar more suspicious.’

A
 meeting was arranged where both sisters admitted extensive personal 
expenditure and were thanked for their honesty, the jury was told, and 
Francesca said that she wanted to pay the money back. 

But at a further 
meeting in July last year, the tone changed and both women refused to 
continue working on a reduced salary.

After a final attempt by Mr Gajjar
 to find an amicable solution, in August 2012 the sisters were arrested.

Divorce: Nigella Lawson and her ex-husband 
Charles Saatchi, 70, are both set to give prosecution evidence against their two former PAs

Claims: TV cook Nigella Lawson is expected to give evidence to the court next Wednesday against her former employees

Miss
 Carpenter claimed the women would say their ‘exorbitant’ spending was 
in exchange for keeping silent about Miss Lawson’s alleged heavy cocaine
 use.

The prosecutor added: 
‘It is anticipated they will claim Mr Saatchi and Miss Lawson permitted 
them to use the credit cards to buy themselves presents and withdraw 
cash because of the long hours they worked.

‘The
 defendants’ case is that Miss Lawson’s alleged drug use and the 
defendants’ knowledge of it materially affected Miss Lawson’s attitude 
to the defendants’ spending.’

The case continues.
