For Celtic fans analysing Ronny Deila’s six years in charge of Stromsgodset, the devil very much lies in the detail.

When the Norwegian bid farewell to the team from the small city of Drammen in June, he did so with a Premier League title to his name, the first in 43 years at the club. A remarkable ending to a sporting fairytale, if ever there was one.

That feat – which led to Deila being elevated to a kind of footballing demi-God in his homeland – was all the more remarkable in that it did not come courtesy of an oligarch’s deep pockets.

Deila succeeded because he was allowed a free rein to do as he saw fit and was backed by a board with unshakable belief in his methods.

They also indulged him with time. Lots of it. His first two years in the post were spent fighting relegation before it suddenly all clicked into place. And there, for Celtic fans, is the rub.

Glasgow is not a place which welcomes project managers with open arms. Tangible signs of progress are best to be seen yesterday.

For Deila, the opening four months of his journey at Celtic have proven to be bitty and uncertain. Doubtless not helped by injuries to a string of internationals, the Norwegian has nonetheless failed to convince the court of public opinion.

And yet, ahead of four successive home matches over three competitions against Astra, Kilmarnock, Partick Thistle and Inverness, he feels more certain than ever before that his grand plan is about to take root.

‘I think, in the last month, things are happening,’ he declared. ‘I think we are going in the right way and I think the players are starting to get confidence.

‘I can see in training that we are starting to get some relations and patterns in the attacking play. We are better in the transition defensively and we haven’t conceded many chances or goals. So I think confidence is coming into the boys and we are starting to get a good team and I hope to show that against Astra.

‘If you take the games since the last (international) break, we have had some good results and also created more and had a better team. Now with the players coming back I trust the team even more. We seem a competitive and strong team.’

Even allowing for Ross County’s lowly position in the league, there was something indisputably impressive about the way Deila’s side swatted the Highlanders aside on Saturday.

In that regard, it’s hard to understate the significance of the fact that the influential John Guidetti is ineligible for tonight’s game.

Stefan Scepovic, the only player for whom Deila has thus far paid hard cash, is likely to be trusted with the main striking role. The Serb has much to prove.

But, in keeping with his theme of individual and collective improvement, Deila believes his No 9 is now primed and ready to repay some of the £2.3million invested in him.

‘He is very hungry to play and he wants to show himself,’ he said. ‘He came on against Ross County and had a good chance there and you can see in his eyes he wants to improve. He is a good player. I’ve seen him score some fantastic goals in training this week. I’m looking forward to seeing more from him on the pitch.’

Asked if the player has been physically building himself up over the past month, Deila quipped: ‘Yeah but we don’t we take any drugs so it takes more time!

‘It’s not only two or three times in the gym and you are there, it takes maybe half a year to get the strength we want. But he’s working all the time. It’s also about mentality. Against Ross County he kept the defender working, his touch was good, so he has to go on from there.’

If it’s taking Deila some time to figure out Scepovic, no such allowances have to be made for Stefan Johansen.

An integral part of Stromgodset’s title-winning team before being signed by Neil Lennon, the Norwegian has curiously looked ill at ease in the deep-lying role Deila has sporadically played him in.

Yet, in a more advanced role in Dingwall, he was a revelation. Point made, surely?

‘We have different options,’ Deila replied. ‘That’s good, it’s what I want. I don’t want to stick to one system. We want to look at an opponent and pick the right system against them. We have played 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3 and we’ll see what we do tomorrow.

‘We’ve also played 4-4-2. It’s important that it’s not about systems, it’s about principles and the principles are getting the full-backs forwards, the wingers coming in, triangles on the sides, getting crosses, getting people into the box. You can see that more now and hopefully we can get even better.’

We’ve been here before under Deila, of course. The green shoots of progress stamped on by another flat, demoralising defeat. Three wins on the bounce have only been recorded once this season.

Sooner rather than later, he needs a run of results. A body of work he can point to as incontrovertible evidence that the project is coming good.

‘I haven’t seen that statistic but I want more than four, I want to have 10,’ he stated. ‘The goals are very clear and that’s what we’re fighting for. What I have experienced here is that you have to take one game at a time, you need to focus on one and give that all your energy.

‘We did that well against Ross County, we were mentally ready and had won the game after 30 minutes. That has to give the boys confidence and that’s what we want on the pitch tomorrow as well. Get good control of the game and get the tempo up and try to finish as quick as possible.’

What he’d give for a maximum return from the back-to-back games against the Romanians.

Ten points might not quite have Celtic over the qualification line (depending on how the Salzburg-Dinamo games go) but they would provide considerable shelter from whatever storms winter throws his way.

‘That is the goal - to get through - and that will be hard because there are good teams there,’ he stressed.

‘It looks like a battle between three teams and Astra are one of the teams we have to beat. If we do that, we are in a very good situation in the group.

‘If we get (back) to the Champions League we have to be even better again so I think the Europa League is very important to get experience and to play together as a team, to get the new players used to European football.

‘We have a new team and a new style of play and I think the European matches have been very important for us. We have played 10 different games now in Europe, when you take the pre-season games as well, and I don’t remember one game where we had control.

‘We want to go and control more games, especially at home, and play attractive football. I would like also like what you saw from Scotland against Poland, against European opponents. To play high quality games because the Europa League is high quality.’
