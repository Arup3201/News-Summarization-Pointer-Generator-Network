Two Kenyan men have signed a written contract to share a woman they both love, who refuses to choose between them.

When the men realised that she had been having affairs with both of them for four years, instead of ending their respective relationships, the men decided that neither of them could live without her.

Community policing officer Adhalah Abdulrahman in Kisauni tried to mediate between the pair.

Marriage on a rota: Sylvester Mwendwa is one of the men getting married. He will take it in turns to live with his 'wife'

Mr Abdulrahman said: 'I heard people 
fighting and went to check, but I was surprised to see two men fighting 
over a woman who is said to be a widow and a mother of twins.

'I tried solving the issue but they refused, each insisting he could not live without the woman.'

Mr Sylvester Mwendwa, one of the ‘husbands’, said he decided to share her with Mr Elijah Kimani.

Mr Mwendwa told the BBC he loved the woman and that the contract was intended to 'set boundaries' and 'keep the peace'.

He explained how it will work: 'She is like the central referee. She can say whether she wants me or my colleague.'

They will both pay her rent and for the upkeep of any children that she has in the future.

Disagreement: The arrangement in Kisauni, Kenya has caused controversy as polyandry is virtually unheard of in the country

Mr Abdulrahman explained: 'We discussed everything and they agreed that even if the woman gives birth they will raise the child as their own since they have been taking care of the woman’s children together.'

In Kenya polygamy is legal but polyandry is also legal, though almost unheard of.

Polyandry is permissible as long as it can be proved that it is part of a tribal custom.

The woman wishes to remain anonymous.
