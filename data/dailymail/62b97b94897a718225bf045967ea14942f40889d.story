Floyd Mayweather Jr has claimed he was justified in talking about his ex-fiancee's abortion on social media because they are too famous to have privacy.

Shantel Jackson, the undefeated boxing champion's former fiancee, filed a lawsuit claiming Mayweather had publicly humiliated her by posting a sonogram picture of her pregnancy online and claiming they broke up because she had an abortion. 

In legal documents, Mayweather lays out his defence, saying: 'Both parties are public figures. Abortion is a public issue.'

Floyd Mayweather says he was justified in discussing ex-fiancee Shantel Jackson's (pictured with Mayweather) abortion on social media because they were a famous couple

Earlier this year, Miss Jackson sued Mayweather for assault, battery, defamation and invasion of privacy, TMZ reported, but he is now attempting to have some of these claims dismissed.

Legal files submitted by the boxer say: 'At age 37 I am an undefeated boxer. I have been the world champion in five different weight divisions.'

He adds that when he met Miss Jackson 'she asked me to help her become famous' and that her own claim to fame was appearing in seven music videos.

Because of his high profile, Mayweather says he was entitled to post details about every aspect of the relationship, including the break-up, on social media.

He adds: 'Both parties are public figures. Abortion is a public issue.

'A public figure involved with another public figure in a public relationship can expect publicity, not privacy, about why it ends.'  

As well as the offending Instagram post, Miss Jackson claimed Mayweather also threatened to post naked photos of her on social media if she didn't take down a picture she posted of herself with rapper Nelly at a basketball game in April.

In a tearful statement in September, Miss Jackson said: 'I have been embarrassed and humiliated more than I can ever imagine by Floyd, whom I once called my best friend and fiance.’ 

She added that she finally left him after seven years because she concluded he was abusive and would not change. 

Mayweather served two months in jail in 2012 after pleading guilty to reduced domestic battery charges stemming from a hair-pulling, arm-twisting attack on his former girlfriend, Josie Harris, while two of their three children watched.

Miss Jackson stood by him through the case and visited him in prison, but after he was released she was physically assaulted, her attorney Gloria Allred said.

The champion boxer allegedly twisted his girlfriend's arm, choked her and snatched her phone. 

The lawsuit alleged that in April 2013, the 37-year-old star athlete assaulted his fiancée once again and 'bent her arm, restrained her, and pointed a gun at her foot asking "Which toe do you want me to shoot?"'

The husband-to-be then allegedly demanded that Jackson take off her 17-carat engagement ring at gunpoint.

The lawsuit also accused Mayweather of arranging to have over $1million worth of Jackson's property taken from a storage unit.
