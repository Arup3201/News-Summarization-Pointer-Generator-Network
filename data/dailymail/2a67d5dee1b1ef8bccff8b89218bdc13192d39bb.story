Six people suspected of being 'slaves' have been rescued by police following a raid at a Bournemouth garage this morning.

Dorset Police raided the AA Clock Garage as part of an investigation into forced labour and human trafficking.

As a result six men, aged between 20 and 30, have been taken to a place of safety and are being given all the help and support they need.

A 23-year-old man from Bournemouth has been arrested in connection with slavery offences.

Detective Superintendent Kevin Connolly, who is leading the investigation, said: 'Today's operation is the result of a detailed and protracted inquiry and our primary aim is to protect and safeguard vulnerable victims.

'Human trafficking is happening up and down the country.

'In such cases victims are often forced to live and work in poor and unsanitary conditions, sometimes with little or no pay. Some may not recognise themselves as victims and, even if they do, they may feel unable to speak to the police or other authorities.'

The business sells cars and vans and is also a hand car wash centre. It has no connection with the Automobile Association.

A person living near the garage told the Bournemouth Echo: 'They keep themselves very much to themselves.

'They come and go. We were on holiday over the summer period and when we came back there was a minibus of them going and the crowd that were there before had gone.

'They've never bothered the neighbours, but it's deteriorated since it's opened.'

Det Supt Connolly added: 'Human trafficking is a serious offence and Dorset Police remains committed towards tackling such cases.

'Human trafficking, particularly in the form of servitude, is a hidden crime and we will do everything we can to ensure this immoral trade is stopped.

'In order to do this we also need help from the public.

'I would urge anyone who has any information about such offences in Dorset or concerns about people in their community to contact us in confidence on 101.'

During the operation, police were assisted by Bournemouth Borough Council, the National Crime Agency and the Red Cross.

A British Red Cross spokeswoman said: 'The British Red Cross has been called in by Dorset Police to provide assistance to people being supported in a place of safety following an investigation into forced labour and human trafficking.

'The Red Cross works with the emergency services to provide assistance to vulnerable people in times of crisis.'
