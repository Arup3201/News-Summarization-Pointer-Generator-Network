Winning team: Olympic hero Sir Bradley Wiggins and his wife, Catherine, who, he claims, brokered many of the deals MTC management is claiming commission for

Cycling champion Sir Bradley Wiggins is embroiled in a complex legal tussle over his earnings from his £5 million Tour de France triumph and sponsorship deals.

The 2012 Olympic gold medallist, who became the first Briton to win the Tour, is being sued in the High Court by his former management team at the MTC agency.

The dispute began when MTC, which represents sporting stars including Sally Gunnell, Jonathan Edwards, Colin Jackson and Steve Backley, billed him for commission of £741,000 on his contract with Team Sky.

Sir Bradley, who was knighted in the 2013 New Year’s Honours List, refused to pay, according to the writ.

He then terminated his arrangement with MTC and issued a counter-claim. In it, he accused the agency of trying to charge fees it was not entitled to on his personal income from cycling, and claimed the firm’s accounting system was disorganised.

MTC claims it agreed to act as his sole agent in exchange for 20 per cent of his gross income from TV appearances and sponsorship deals.

But Sir Bradley says that the company was entitled to commission only on contracts it negotiated for him, and that for his first four years with the firm, some deals were arranged by his wife Catherine and friends.

After his success at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where he won two gold medals, Sir Bradley asked MTC managing director Jonathan Marks to act for him  in connection with his move to Team Sky, it is claimed.

Three years later, he is said to have asked Mr Marks to renegotiate his contract with the team.

Sky principal and British cycling supremo Sir Dave Brailsford allegedly told Mr Marks in a phone call that Sir Bradley had been offered up to £4 million a year, plus a £1 million bonus, if he won the 2012 Tour de France.

As a result, MTC is said to have invoiced Sir Bradley for nearly £750,000 to reflect his enhanced earning power.

MTC accuses him of breaching his obligations under their agreement. Sir Bradley – nicknamed ‘Wiggo’ by his fans – denies this.

The cyclist, who lives with Catherine and their children Ben and Isabella in a farmhouse in Eccleston, Lancashire, is now represented by XIX Entertainment, the celebrity agency owned by Pop Idol creator Simon Fuller.

Sir Bradley, 33, is Britain’s most decorated Olympian, having won seven medals during his career – one more than rower Sir Steve Redgrave.

He started competitive cycling at the age of 12, when a crash  in South London’s Herne Hill velodrome put him on the road  to greatness. The accident led to a £1,000 compensation payout which enabled him to buy his first racing bike.

In his 2009 autobiography, he tells of a spiral into doubt and depression after the 2004 Olympics, when his low income and lack of recognition left his family struggling for money.

In January last year, Sir Bradley’s legal team wrote to MTC, suspending its authority  to act for him and his charitable foundation.

The agency says this amounted to a repudiation of their agreement and entitled them to sue  for damages.

A spokesman for XIX Entertainment said last night: ‘Sir Bradley is no longer represented by MTC. He strenuously denies that it was he who breached the terms of any contract and as  this is subject to legal proceeding he will not be commenting further.’

MTC declined to comment.
