Victor Valdes has travelled to Monaco in a bid to prove his fitness ahead of a free transfer after Barcelona released the goalkeeper at the end of last season.

The 32-year-old is currently out with a serious knee injury that will almost certainly keep him out for months.

But the big-spending Ligue 1 side are keen to measure the extent of the problem and whether Valdes is still a viable long-term option.

It's all over: The goalkeeper ended a 19-year association with Barcelona at the end of last season

Leonardo Jardim - appointed after the sacking of Claudio Ranieri - will lead Monaco into the Champions League next season.

The former Sporting Lisbon coach appeared to have abandoned plans to sign the Spain international, even though the club had agreed a pre-contract agreement back in January.

Valdes ended a 19-year association with the Catalan giants after they decided not to renew his deal at the Nou Camp.

There is a belief that he still has a lot to offer and represents something of a coup for Jardim.

Croatian Danijel Subasic was the No 1 at Stade Louis II last season and would remain so until Valdes' knee healed fully.

One supporter tweeted a picture with the potential new goalkeeper in the principality on Wednesday evening.
