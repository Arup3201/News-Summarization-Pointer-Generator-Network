It was named one of the top 10 parties in the world by Forbes and boasts a glittering list of past participants, among them Ksénia Gorbachev, Barbara Berlusconi and the Ecclestone sisters.

But this year's glamorous Bal des Débutantes in Paris will witness a deb of more humble origins take centre stage.

Lauren Marbe, 17, is the daughter of an Essex taxi driver and was invited to take part after organisers were impressed by her incredibly high score in a Mensa test.

Ball: Clever teenager Lauren Marbe, 17, has been invited to the Ball des Debutantes in Paris next month

Impressed: Lauren was invited to the ball after organisers were impressed by reports of her intelligence

The Essex teenager has an IQ of 161, making her cleverer than Einstein and Bill Gates, and putting her miles ahead of the average of 100.

She still is a long way off the Guinness Book Of Records holder of the highest IQ - held by American magazine columnist and playwright Marylin vos Savant, who has a score of 228.

But then, at 67 years of age, Mrs vos Savant was never in a position to take Lauren's place at this year's deb ball.

Now the teen, who admits to a penchant for fake tan and TOWIE, will join Lady Amelia Windsor, the granddaughter of the Duke of Kent, and John F. Kennedy's great-niece Kyra at the ball, which will take place at the end of November.

'We tell a story about each young lady and this girl certainly has a story to tell,' organiser Ophelie Renouard told the Telegraph.

'I read an article about her, found her interesting and asked her to come and she said yes. She is very excited.'

The Bal des Débutantes has been a Paris institution since 1992 and brings together girls from some of the world's most glittering society families.

Glitttering: Former participants include Theodora Warre, Sofia Barclay and Princess Augusta von Preussen

Wealthy: Former Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev's granddaughter, Anastasia, has also taken part

Although it usually takes place at the magnificent Hotel du Crillon, this year's event will take place at the equally spectacular Automobile Club de France on the Place de la Concorde.

Debutantes are limited to just 25 per
year and each is accompanied by a 'chevalier' [knight], on whose arm 
they will make their debut.

In
Lauren's case, her chevalier will be a 20-year-old Frenchman named 
Théodore Rousseau, who, says the teen, 'doesn't know what an Essex girl 
is'.

Despite her chevalier's patchy knowledge of English women, Lauren, although concerned about her lack of French language skills, says she has 'never been so excited about something' while her mother Susan revealed that her daughter was 'amazed' when the call from Ophelie came.

'When the call came from Ophelie, Lauren had a look and was amazed,' the proud parent revealed.

With a glamorous night in the company of Théodore and the 24 other debs to look forward to, it seems there's plenty of excitement yet to come for Britain's brainiest teen.
