This is the moment cars are picked up as though they are weightless and carried along in flash flooding in France.

The 41-second video shows up to six partially submerged vehicles being battered by a barrage of water  in the city of Collioure, near the Spanish border.

In the footage, cars and jeeps almost disappear from view as they are submerged and dragged along by powerful tidal waves of water.

Abandoned: Three vehicles are abandoned as they are submerged by water in the video

The flood happened on September 8, and since then there has been discussions on the necessity of parking on the riverbed.

According to Newsflare agency, the cameraman stated that the riverbed is dry throughout most of the year, and residents normally have a lot of time to move their vehicles before the water builds up. 

The local council insist that parking on the riverbed is necessary because of a lack of space, while local residents are understandably aggrieved by the risk the flash floods pose to their vehicles.

Going down: This car faces downwards ominously as the water surrounds the vehicle

High winds and torrential showers can be heard and seen during the brief footage, and the reaction of the pedestrians is contrasting throughout the video. 

Above the flooded road large groups of people watch the destruction unfold as others rush about with umbrellas as they try to get out of harm's way.

One woman is seen running with her umbrella as the cars and jeeps below her are battered by the ferocious flash floods.

Panic: This woman rushes as the torrential rain and wind continue to make life hazardous

Observers: Some pedestrians watch the destruction unfolding below them while others rush to get home
