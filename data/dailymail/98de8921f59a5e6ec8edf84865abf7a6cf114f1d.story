A California teenager just wanted a quick meal from KFC, but he was left in disgust after he discovered a chicken organ in his food.

Manuel Cobarubies had ordered a $4 meal of fried chicken breast, thighs and corn when he found what appeared to be a brain of a chicken last Tuesday.

The high school student was contacted by a KFC consultant who told him the organ was a kidney or gizzard and is 'safe to eat'.

As 'grossed out' as he was from the incident, all Cobarubies wanted for the inconvenience was a refund.

A California teenager just wanted a quick meal from KFC, but he was left in disgust after he discovered a chicken organ (above) in his food

Manuel Cobarubies (above), a student at Stockton High School, had ordered a $4 meal of fried chicken breast, thighs and corn when he found what appeared to be a brain of a chicken last Tuesday

Cobarubies said when he found the organ, he spit it into the trash, and then took his frustrations to Twitter (above). Following no replies from KFC, the teen's tweet was shared 231 times and finally caught their attention

Cobarubies who attends Stockton High School said when he found the organ on February 3, he spit it into the trash, and then took his frustrations to Twitter, according to Fox40. 

'I do eat there often so I mean coming across something like that is just like wow,' he said. 

'(It looked) like a brain to me. I mean at that point, red flags were kind of raised.'

The student said he directly reached out to the chain's location on Martin Luther King Boulevard in Stockton where he ordered the meal, but never got a reply.

Richard Ramos, a KFC consultant, told him the organ was safe to eat, and that they were working with staff at the branch to ensure the chicken is prepared properly.

Cobarubies said will have to start preparing meals from home following the incident

He wrote: 'I found a f****** brain in my KFC. Don't eat at the KFC on Martin Luther King Blvd.'  

However, after the tweet was shared 231 times, it caught the chain's attention.

Cobarubies was contacted by KFC, which only offered a quick apology, but eventually a KFC consultant reached out to him on Monday.
