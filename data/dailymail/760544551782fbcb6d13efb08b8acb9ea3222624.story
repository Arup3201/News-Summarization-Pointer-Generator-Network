Top clubs across Europe are keeping an eye on Shakhtar Donetsk's Brazilian stars after six of them refused to return to Ukraine for the new season.

The six include two of Shakhtar's
 key midfielders, Alex Teixeira and Douglas Costa, as well as 
Argentinian striker Facundo Ferreyra. Costa, 23, is a long-term target of Manchester United.

The players remained in France following a friendly against Lyon on Saturday, as fighting continues in the city of Donetsk.

Creative spark: Bernard was a member of the Brazil World Cup squad and was an Arsenal target last summer

Meanwhile, 
Brazil winger Bernard, Shakhtar's most high-profile player who chose a 
move to Ukraine over a transfer to Arsenal last summer, is yet to rejoin
 the squad after his World Cup exploits in his native country.

It is not yet known whether the 21-year-old will join his compatriots in their refusal to return to the war-torn country.

Shakhtar's owner says the six players will be punished financially if they fail to return.

'If they 
don't come then in the first instance they will suffer,' the club's 
billionaire owner Rinat Akhmetov said in a statement on the Shakhtar 
website.

Refusing to fulfil their contracts could cost the players 'tens of millions of euros' in compensation payments to the club, he warned.

'I don't rule out that these players will return to the club soon,' Akhmetov said, adding that several of them could arrive Monday and that the club would not seek to sell them.

The Ukrainian military is attempting to retake the city of Donetsk in the east of the country, which is controlled by pro-Russian rebels.

Akhmetov is Ukraine's richest man and a leading power-broker in the east of the country, where his companies employ hundreds of thousands of people.

He has publicly opposed the rebels and earlier this month pleaded with Ukrainian forces not to bomb Donetsk.

The Ukrainian Football Federation has yet to rule where Shakhtar will play their home games while the conflict rages.

Akhmetov has expressed a preference for the mostly Russian-speaking city of Kharkiv in the north-east.

'We aren't going to take risks and in no way will we take players to somewhere that is dangerous,' Akhmetov said.

Future worries: Shakhtar are due to play Champions League football again next season

Argentinian striker Sebastian Blanco has also refused to return to his Ukrainian club, Metalist Kharkiv, ahead of the new season, local media report.

Shakhtar's first game of the season is the Ukrainian Super Cup against Dynamo Kiev, which will be played in the western city of Lviv.

As Ukrainian champions, Shakhtar have qualified for the group stage of this season's Champions League.
