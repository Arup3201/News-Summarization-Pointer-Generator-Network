The woman is 39 weeks pregnant (posed by model)

A judge has ruled a mentally ill woman who is 39 weeks pregnant will have a Caesarean section because she had visions of babies 'popping out.'

Mrs Justice Roberts heard that the woman's unpredictability meant she posed a risk if she was to try and give birth naturally. 

The judge gave specialists the go-ahead to perform a planned Caesarean section following a hearing in the Court of Protection - which sits in private to make decisions involving sick and vulnerable people. 

The court heard that the woman, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, lacked the mental capacity to make decisions about her own treatment. 

At a hearing last night both medical experts and the woman's husband gave evidence. 

Doctors said the woman's 'level of unpredictability' posed a risk if a natural delivery was attempted.

A psychiatrist said the woman had a 'child-like vision' of babies 'popping out'.

They said a delivery by planned Caesarean section was the safest option - and the woman's husband agreed.

The judge said she was satisfied that a planned Caesarean section was in the woman's best interests.

She added that the woman - who is Polish, in her 30s, suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and is detained under the terms of mental health legislation - could not be identified.

But she said the health authority which had made the application could be named as the London North West Healthcare NHS Trust

The NHS trust had asked the judge to rule that delivery by planned Caesarean section would be lawful. 

Lawyers appointed by the court to represent the woman's interests had supported that application.

Mrs Justice Roberts said the woman was not resisting undergoing a Caesarean section. 

London North West NHS Healthcare Trust manages Northwick Park and St Mark's Hospitals in Harrow and Central Middlesex Hospital in Park Royal, as well as Ealing Hospital. It has been given the go-ahead for surgery

But she said she simply lacked the capacity to make an informed choice.

The judge was told that the woman was likely to undergo surgery within the next two days.

The Court of Protection, based in London, sits in private and makes decisions about the medical treatment, care and property of those who cannot decide for themselves. 

It can deal with life or death decisions  for people who are incapacitated. Judges sitting in the court can also send people to prison in private. 

But the secrecy of the court has recently been criticised. 

Sir James Munby, head of the family courts, has repeatedly called for more openness.

The Court of Protection is based at the Royal Courts of Justice in London and makes decisions in private
