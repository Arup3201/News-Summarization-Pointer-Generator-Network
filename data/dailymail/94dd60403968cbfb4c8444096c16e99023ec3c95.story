As one of the best viola players in the world, Kathryn Bassano has performed with Madonna, Mick Jagger and Sting.

Married to famous conductor, Peter Bassano, and with four children privately educated at Eton and Cheltenham Ladies' College, Mrs Bassano lives with her family in a £3million, six-bedroom house in the Buckinghamshire countryside.

But now the 57-year-old classical musician has been forced by a High Court ruling to sell her £400,000 antique viola to pay off loans after a lengthy legal dispute over what was a £16,000 builder's bill.

Kathryn Bassano, 57, has been forced to sell her rare viola to pay legal bills arising from a dispute with builders

Musical instrument dealer Alfred Toft, left, lent Mrs Bassano - who was represented in court by her conductor husband Peter Bassano, 68, right, - £100,000 in February 2010 using her rare Ceruti viola as security

The builder successfully sued for the money, which was owed as part of a £100,000 bill for works carried out on their home in 2002, and the lawyers' bills continued to mount up when the musical couple lost their appeal against the decision in 2007.

To pay the legal bills totalling more than £185,000, Mrs Bassano, from Great Missenden, used the rare viola, made by renowned Cremonese craftsman, Giovanni Battista Ceruti in 1803, as security for a series of cash loans.

Mrs Bassano effectively 'mortgaged' her instrument for six-figure loans to two antique instrument dealers, Alfred Toft and Peter Biddulph, and a pawnbroking firm, Borro Loan Ltd, raising £280,000 as a result.

The court heard that instrument dealer Mr Biddulph lent Mrs Bassano £50,000 in 2009 after agreeing that he would sell the viola, which she had owned for years, on her behalf.  The loan was arranged on the understanding that the money he lent her would be repaid when he sold the viola.

In February 2010 Mr Toft, also a dealer in fine stringed instruments, who lives in Penshurst, Kent, lent Mrs Bassano £100,000 after she approached him following a service at his local church.

The loan carried a monthly interest rate of 2.5 per cent.

Finally, Mrs Bassano, a former member of Academy of St Martins in the Fields and a number of symphony orchestras, pledged the viola to Borro Loan in return for £130,000.

Mr Bassano, with what the judge described as ‘conspicuous skill’, fought his wife’s corner in court after she was too unwell to attend the hearing, insisting that the loans were unenforceable.

However, Mr Justice Popplewell rejected the conductor's bid to save the viola for his wife, and ruled that Mr Toft and Borro Loan were entitled to their money back, with interest.

The viola was bought by Mr Biddulph last month for £230,000, but that was not enough to cover Mrs Bassano’s debts.

The money will be divided up between Borro Loan and Mr Toft, but that still leaves Mrs Bassano heavily in debt and facing a potential claim by Mr Biddulph for return of the £50,000 he loaned her.

Good violas, like this one, can cost several thousand pounds but Mrs Bassano's could be worth up to £400,000, an antiques dealer said

On top of that, the couple, who were reportedly declared bankrupt last year, may face having to pay the six-figure legal costs of the three-day High Court hearing.

Earlier Mr Bassano argued that the viola was worth far more than the £230,000. It had been insured for £350,000 in 2009 and, he said, was probably worth more than that now.

But the judge described the price Mr Biddulph paid as 'the best price reasonably obtainable'.

Speaking outside court at the beginning of the case, Mr Toft said of the contested instrument: 'It’s a nice viola - it’s a rarity.

'Ceruti was the last of the great Cremonese makers. Whoever buys it will probably sell it for about £400,000.'

The Bassanos' house was put on the market a year ago for £3million.

Peter Bassano is a former member of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and professor at the Royal College of Music and is part of a 500-year-old musical dynasty, with a family tree linking him to six talented Italian brothers brought over from Italy by Henry VIII to entertain his court.

A trombonist who is music director at the Oxford University Sinfonietta and conductor of the city of Rochester Symphony Orchestra, his ancestors were Venetian musicians.

Kathryn Bassano, also known as Kathy, is a former member of the Academy of St Martins in the Fields and a member of a number of symphony orchestras.  Originally from Yorkshire, she has been playing the viola since the age of 11 and is said to be one of the world's best.

She was the first woman to play principal viola with the English Chamber Orchestra and has performed with Madonna and Westlife, Mick Jagger and Sting.  She has also recorded soundtracks for the Harry Potter and The Lord Of The Rings films.

The couple have four children, three boys and a girl, and the boys were educated at Eton (where boarding fees cost £33,000 a year) while their daughter went to Cheltenham Ladies College (£30,000 a year).

They bought their brick and flint house which enjoys far-reaching views over the Buckinghamshire countryside in 1997 for £350,000, and it is now said to be worth around £3million.
