Grim search: Police hunting for barrister Gianni Sonvico have found a body in the Thames near Greenwich pier, just east of where he was last seen

Police searching for a young barrister on his way home from a law event have found a body in the Thames.

It is thought Gianni Sonvico, 23, may have fallen into the river near the Tower Hill area of London at around 11pm on Friday, October 25. He has not been seen since.

Police were called to reports of a body floating in the water near Greenwich Pier at about 10am today. Mr Sonvico's family have been informed.

The keen Arsenal fan, who lives near the club's Emirates Stadium in Highbury, north London, was last seen after going to a function for young barristers at the Middle Temple, near Blackfriars.

Middle Temple is one of four institutions called 'Inns of Court' which have the sole right to appoint barristers.

About 2,000 people have joined a Facebook group appealing for information following Mr Sonvico's disappearance.

His mother, Karen Chandler, said: 'He is my son, my world, my fellow Arsenal supporter, the person I argue with about politics and the only person in the world that can call me out. Please help bring him back to me.'

His sister, Maya Sonvico, 20, added: 'He has always been the first person to protect me from anything that can hurt me or anyone who can hurt me.

'What worries me is that I know if he could contact me he would. He wouldn't put us through this.'

Another post added: 'For Gianni to miss an Arsenal match is like him missing Christmas.'

In a video appeal posted to YouTube, but later removed from the site, his sister said his friends last saw him leaving Tower Hill underground station.

He told them he was making his way home, she said.

Mr Sonvico, a researcher for the Law Commission, grew up in Pembrokeshire, Wales. His former headteacher described him as a 'brilliant' student.

Master David Ormerod, of the Law Commission, said: 'Police have now confirmed that CCTV footage shows Gianni in the Tower Hill area.

'The evidence is currently pointing to there being no foul play, but possibly a tragic accident.

'The police are very keen to speak to anyone who was at the Middle Temple Party on Friday night (October 25) or in the Tower Hill area around 22:15 on Friday.'
