The Miami Heat have reached a fourth straight NBA Finals after they swept past the Indiana Pacers.

Miami recorded an emphatic 117-92 win against Indiana - to become the first team since the Boston Celtics in the mid 1980's to achieve the feat.

The game 6 victory at their American Airlines Arena meant the No 2 seeds in the East won the best-of-seven series 4-2.

LeBron James and Chris Bosh led the Heat's charge with 25 points a piece - who will now face either the San Antonio Spurs or Oklahoma City Thunder in the sport's showpiece.

James added six assists and four rebounds to his haul while Bosh finished with eight assists.

Rashard Lewis and Dwyane Wade were the only other players for the hosts to score in double figures with 13.

Heat coach Erik Spoelstra was happy with his side's performance.

'We feel grateful we were able to do it at home,' he said after the match.

'We would have liked to have closed it out in Indiana but they pushed us and we had to do it here. So we don't take it for granted.'

For the Pacers, it is the third year in succession that they have been eliminated in the NBA post-season to the hands of Miami.

Paul George scored a game-high 29 points for Indiana who trailed for the majority of the match.

David West and Lance Stephenson were the only other two Pacers to record double figures with 16 and 11 respectively.

'Everybody is hurt,' said a forlorn Stephenson post-match.

'Everybody worked so hard to get to the point we are at right now. We keep losing when we get here. Hopefully we can get back here and show we belong here.'

Sure shot: Indiana Pacers forward Paul George scored a game-high of 29 points
