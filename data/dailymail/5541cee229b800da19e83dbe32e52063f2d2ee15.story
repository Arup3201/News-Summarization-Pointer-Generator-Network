Comedian Eddie Izzard issued a plea to Scotland ‘please don’t go’, becoming the latest celebrity to warn against backing independence.

Izzard admitted he found the launch of the new slogan ‘intimidating’ after being subjected to online abuse when he announced he would stage a fundraiser for the Better Together campaign.

Singer David Bowie, tennis ace Andy Murray and broadcaster Andrew Marr have previously been targeted online by ‘cyber nats’.

Comedian Eddie Izzard today issued a plea to Scots not to leave the United Kingdom

Speaking ahead of the fundraiser, 
Izzard said he is expecting more foul-mouthed abuse than when cutting 
his comedy teeth on the streets of Edinburgh and Glasgow.

‘It's
 quite a tricky thing because you guys are quite intimidating,’ he 
said.  ‘Obviously if there are people who are politically against it, 
that is quite intimidating.

‘I am going into politics. I'm running for office in 2020 so I am more up to speed on this, but it's a tricky old thing.’

He
 said he remains ‘positive’ about the Scottish people and its 
Parliament, which he thinks should have as many powers as Scots want it 
to have.

He contrasted the 
‘blood and death’ of the border wars of history with the united spirit 
of Team GB, recalling Scottish tennis ace Andy Murray's Olympic gold 
winning victory which he watched in the back of an Edinburgh taxi.

‘It
 wasn't me, an Englishman, saying look there's a Scotsman,’ he said. ‘It
 was just that we are British, and he was winning, and it was us, and I 
think that is beautiful.

‘If
 you look back at the history of what used to happen between the Scots 
and the English, the war and the blood and the death, I think it is 
beautiful that we have got to this position of being together.'

The event marked a stepping up of the Better Together campaign after polls narrowed in recent days

Izzard went on: ‘I am an Englishman called Edward, and
 there are a few Edwards that have had a history at Bannockburn and in 
the Braveheart film.

‘But I 
am an Edward who ran eight marathons with a Scottish flag. I ran to the 
top of Arthur's Seat here in Edinburgh, and I've also played nearly 
every major town and city in Scotland up to and including Shetland.

‘I've run the whole of the UK and I didn't find a difference when I got to the border of Scotland.

‘I
 do want to do honour to the Scottish people. When I watched Braveheart I
 was in tears and I was rooting for the Scottish people.’

He
 appeared alongside former Chancellor Alistair Darling as the No 
campaign stepped up its drive to woo voters, amid growing concern that 
the polls have narrowed I recent weeks.

Izzard
 pledged to keep his jokes apolitical at the Better Together fundraiser 
at Edinburgh's Festival Theatre tonight, but said he is expecting some 
heckling.

‘You've got to 
realise that I am transvestite so I've already had a lot of negative 
things said to me over the years in the street, so nothing in politics 
can happen which is worse than that,’ he said, bearing his nails painted
 with the British and European flags.

‘It's
 a political statement, British European transvestite, and if you're a 
Scottish transvestite you can have the same nails and it will still 
work.’

Better Together leader Alistair Darling joined Izzard at the event to launch the slogan: 'Scotland, Please don't go!'

Izzard will be joined on stage by local comedian Andy Todd, author of the satirical book Fat Minister's Question Time.

Todd said: ‘The referendum is a serious issue but that doesn't mean we can't make jokes about it.

‘With months of campaigning behind us and five months still to go, it's easy to lose track of the issues as each side goes over them again and again and again.

‘A good joke is like a firework. It cuts through everything and makes even the most jaded sit up and listen.

‘The referendum is a decision for the people of Scotland but its impact doesn't stop at Gretna.

‘It's right that people in the rest of the United Kingdom make their feelings known.

‘They might not have a vote but they have a voice and it should be heard.’

Families and businesses would face soaring costs in an independent Scotland regardless of what currency is adopted, it was warned yesterday.

New research by one of the country's largest firms yesterday cast severe doubt on the SNP's plans for separation and predicts rising costs, higher taxes and deep public spending cuts.

A three-month study commissioned by Weir Group from experts at Oxford Economics said the economy 'could succeed' after the referendum in the event of a Yes vote, but it could take around 15 years to achieve.

It added that whatever currency is used, Scottish companies are 'likely to face higher funding costs post-independence'.

Changing currency could mean 'substantial one-off costs for business, amounting to around £800million'. This is along with 'ongoing transaction costs on businesses and households of around £500million per year'.

But it added that even if a currency union with the UK is agreed, it would lead to either higher taxes or public spending cuts of around £9billion a year to meet strict debt ratio requirements.

Weir Group is the latest in a number of huge employers - including Standard Life, Lloyds Bank, RBS and Scottish Widows - who have raised concerns about the economic impact of separation.

Research yesterday showed that the firms who have expressed alarm over independence employ a total of 50,000 Scots.

Weir Group chief executive Keith Cochrane said: 'As a political document, the Scottish Government's White Paper paints a picture of independence as being a risk-free option with only potential benefits.

'However, voters should be aware that what they are being asked to say Yes to carries substantial risks to our economy and therefore to the quality of life of millions of people. The costs of independence are guaranteed but the benefits are uncertain.'

Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: 'The Weir Group is an important company in Scotland. I actually welcome their contribution to the debate.

'I am looking forward early next month to meeting senior management and staff to discuss these very issues and I hope to reassure them on some of the points they have made.' Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said that with some of Scotland's biggest employers raising 'legitimate concerns' about the economic impact of independence 'the SNP can no longer be so dismissive over their warnings'.

Former chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, said: 'Yet again, it is clear from a company employing hundreds of Scots that being part of the UK is good for jobs here and it keeps down costs for families in Scotland.
