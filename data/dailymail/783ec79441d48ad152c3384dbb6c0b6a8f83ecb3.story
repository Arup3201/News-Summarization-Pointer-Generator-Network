With the latest film of the Hunger Games trilogy, Catching Fire, hitting our screens this month, just as the Christmas party season kicks off in earnest, we're thinking that tribute-style hair and make-up, as overseen by the glamorous Effie Trinket, is just the inspiration we've been looking for.

But, if you don't have your very own Cinna on hand, don't panic. This week, we caught up with top make-up artist Emma White Turle who has worked with A-listers from Jerry Hall and Kelly Brook to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Justin Timberlake, and will be prepping the Hunger Games stars for the red carpet at next week's Catching Fire premiere.

While you might think that the Capitol looks are a little too extreme for real life, Emma explains that they can be made much more wearable.

'Worn all together, they could look a little OTT,' she admits. 'But I definitely think that these futuristic trends are starting to make their way into the mainstream. More and more people are wearing strong colours and feeling free to experiment more, and beauty brands are allowing them to experiment with innovative textures and shades.'

Here's Emma's step-by-step guide to getting a Hunger Games-inspired party look.

1) Flawless skin

'Jennifer Lawrence has amazing skin – and in fact everyone in the Capitol has this really ethereal luminosity to their complexion. In real life, that means cleansing properly. 

I use Sisley's Eau Efficace (£71, 
johnlewis.com), which is expensive but it's brilliant and lasts forever.
Once skin’s clean, start with Smashbox's Photo Finish Luminising Primer
(£25, boots.com) It’s a very sheer pale pearlescent primer with gold 
flecks that suits all skintones and I use that as the base for a really 
luminous look.

I 
particularly concentrate on the tops of the cheeks, the brow, the centre
of the nose, the Cupid's bow of the lips and the chin.

2) Conceal and mattify

Once you've created that luminous base, you need to conceal as required. I use Bobbi Brown correctors and concealers (£18.50, bobbibrown.co.uk) wherever they're needed.

A little bit under the eyes, a touch around the nose, and on any blemishes. Then, tap on a little bit of translucent powder.

The Smashbox Photo Set Finishing Powder (£18, boots.com) regulates oil and moisturises the skin so it does a great job of taking away the ugly shine, while keeping the dewy glow that you want.

3) Liquid gold liner

In the film Cinna wears a really stunning gold eyeliner and I think that's a really fabulous look for parties. I use Make Up For Ever Diamond Powder in Gold (£19.50, gurumakeupemporium.com) - just add a tiny bit of water and you've got a liquid liner.

I use it with the Smashbox Arced Eyeliner Brush (£16, boots.com) to get it just where I want it. Liquid liner like this last longer than pens or pencils and is more precise. If you've never used liquid liner before, I recommend putting a mirror on the table and looking down into it with your elbow resting on the table - it's easier than trying to close one eye.

Finish with a bit of mascara - I like Bobbi Brown's Extreme Party Mascara (£19, bobbibrown.co.uk) because the brush is brilliant - and remember to take it right from the base of the lashes.

4) Contouring

This is a real make-up artist's trick. Use a fan brush or an angled soft dome brush and just remember that whatever you make darker recedes, and whatever you make lighter comes forward.

A little goes a long way so use a light hand and matte brown shade - I use one from the Make Up For Ever Sculpting Kit in Neutral (£27.95, gurumakeupemporium.com) - just under the cheeks and then a lighter one.

To get that almost ghostly effect, rather than using a flat light shade, I like Mac's Iridescent Powder in Silver Dusk (£20, maccosmetics.co.uk) - a touch under the eyebrow, down the centre of the nose and on the Cupid's bow of the lips. Blend well - you don't want any 1980s, Dynasty-style stripes.

5) Red lips

For modern red lips, you don't have to worry about liner, just keep it soft and pretty. I'm using Yves Saint Laurent Le Rouge Pur Couture in N°41, Rouge Madras (£25, johnlewis.com), but if you're scared of red, the one shade I've found that really suits everyone is Smashbox Infrared Matte (£15, boots.com). I use a brush - Chanel's lip brush is the best I've found as it's curved at the end so sweeps into the lip shape and helps to keep the edges soft and wearable.'

'To up the glamour for a party, I love a bit of glitter. I used a brush to apply red glitter - I use a Mac one that I picked up in the US but you can use any brand - on top of the red lipstick. It lasts longer than you might expect - although it's probably worth drinking through a straw.'

'Oh, and a top tip for getting rid of stray glitter: use a clean mascara wand, it takes it straight off.'
