Chanel No.5: The only thing Marilyn Monroe ever wore in bed has been given a glamorous (and expensive) makeover

'What do I wear in bed? Why, Chanel No. 5, of course.'

These are the words famously spoken by the iconic Marilyn Monroe.

In
 the 1950s, the glamour of Chanel No. 5 was reignited by the celebrity 
whose unsolicited endorsement of the fragrance provided invaluable 
publicity.

Most recently, the luxury label enlisted Brad Pitt as the first ever male face of their brand to give it a sexy revamp.

And now the iconic perfume house are taking things even further by unveiling a rare collectible fragrance.

But at a staggering £2732.24 per bottle, would even Brad Pitt buy it with his reported £4.32m paycheck?

Chanel has announced that the bottle of perfume will be in 'its rarest, most collectible form.'

Named the Grand Extrait, the edition trumps the previous £1366.12, 7.5-ounce version as the most expensive fragrance offered by them.

The formula is the exact same as the sweet smelling stuff you can snap up at duty free for around £67, but the bottle is designed to be something quite special.

Crafted in a mould with the help of a specialised glassmaker and then placed in a 'hand-assembled, artisan-crafted case', it aims to be something of a collectible.

Maybe the French fashion and fragrance house need the money to pay for Brad's pay cheque?

It was revealed back in May that the 
Hollywood star was going to front Chanel's new campaign as part of a megabucks deal and  Andrea 
d'Avack, a spokesman for Chanel, said: 'To keep a legend fresh, you 
always have to change its point of view. It is the first time we've had a
 man speaking about a women's fragrance.

'We think very much that the perfume 
is a seduction between a man, a woman and the perfume. No.5 is our 
leading fragrance, and we are willing to make the investment to keep it 
on that level.'

The actor follows in the footsteps of actresses including Monroe, Nicole Kidman, Audrey Tautou and Catherine Deneuve.
