 IN PARIS

Francois Hollande’s chief spin doctor was forced to resign today after it emerged he kept 30 pairs of handmade shoes at the Elysee Palace and had them professionally polished on taxpayers’ money.

Details of Aquilino Morelle’s high living plunged the beleaguered Socialist president into yet another sleaze scandal.

Mr Morelle, 51, was accused of being a ‘little marquis’ in the way he enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle while working for a left-wing head of state who ‘dislikes the rich’.

Got the boot: Aquilino Morelle, left, resigned today after revelations about his shoe collection. He the chief spin doctor to French president Francois Hollande

He publicly announced his resignation at lunchtime today, while insisting: ‘I’ve done nothing wrong’.

According to the investigative website Mediapart, PR chief Mr Morelle was not only infamous for his upmarket shoe collection, but helped himself to numerous perks at the Elysee.

This included regularly raiding vintage bottles from the palace’s extensive wine cellar, and the use of two chauffeurs to ferry his family around Paris.

Mr Morelle is also accused of a conflict of interest in the way that he allegedly breached ethical guidelines for civil servants by working for pharmaceutical companies in 2007 while also a senior official in the ministry for social affairs.

It comes as Mr Hollande faces the lowest poll ratings for any head of state in the history of modern France.

Tired of this: The scandal is the latest embarrassment to Hollande, who pledged to run an administration beyond ethical reproach

Not only is the French economy in free-fall following two years of Socialist mismanagement, but Mr Hollande and his cronies are regularly accused of being hypocrites.

Last year Mr Hollande was forced to sack his budget minister Jerome Cahuzac because he kept half a million pounds in a secret bank account in Switzerland.

Mr Cahuzac, who faces a criminal trial, was shielding his money from the French authorities, despite being responsible for clamping down on tax avoidance.

Earlier this year it emerged that Mr Hollande was using taxpayers’ money to conduct a secret affair with actress Julie Gayet.

This was while the French were paying for Mr Hollande’s then girlfriend, Valerie Trierweiler, to enjoy all the perks of being their de facto first lady.

Despite his resignation, Mr Morelle today insisted: ‘At no point was I in a situation of a conflict of interest.

‘As a civil servant, there are a certain number of outside activities which are permitted by the law, including education and advice.’

Mr Morelle said his busy work schedule meant he needed the chauffeurs to collect his son from school, and denied that his shoe collection was excessive.

However, outside work for civil servants requires authorisation and the department Mr Morelle worked for said it could find no trace of any.

Following his election as president in 2012, Mr Hollande insisted he would run a government that was beyond ethical reproach.
