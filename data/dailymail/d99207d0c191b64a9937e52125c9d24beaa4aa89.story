The bereft mother of teenager Becky Watts has released a poignant baby photo of her tragic daughter, as she spoke publicly for the first time about her 'overwhelming' grief.

Tanya Watts, 46, said she had only now found the strength to speak out about her 'beautiful' angel, ten days after her body parts were found by detectives probing her disappearance.

Becky, 16, vanished last month from the home where she lived with father Darren Galsworthy and stepmother Anjie in Crown Hill, Bristol,  sparking a huge manhunt for the missing teenager.

The mother of teenager Becky Watts has released a poignant baby photo of her tragic daughter (pictured), describing her grief as 'overwhelming'

Tanya Watts, 46, said she had only now found the strength to speak publicly about her 'beautiful' angel's death, ten days after her body parts were found by detectives probing her disappearance 

Her step-brother Nathan Matthews, 28, has now been charged with her murder while his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, 21, is accused of perverting the course of justice.

Karl and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, Jaydene Parsons, 23, and James Ireland, 23, have all been charged with assisting an offender by helping dispose and conceal her remains.  

In a statement issued through Avon and Somerset Police, Ms Watts thanked those who had helped in the search for Becky, saying that she believed her daughter was now 'at peace'.

She said: 'I would like to say a big thank you to everyone who took my beautiful angel into their hearts.

'I have felt unable to say anything about Becky until now as the sense of loss and pain is overwhelming.

'But throughout this time I have been so touched and comforted by how people, many of whom are complete strangers, have taken the time to express their condolences.'

She continued: 'I feel Becky's presence all around me. I know that she is up in heaven with her nanny and grampy and other people that loved her.

'Thank you to all those people who helped search for Becky and get our angel returned to us.

'We were able to see each other one last time: I know that she is at peace and can now have the dignity that she deserves.'

Her mother said: 'I feel Becky's presence all around me. I know that she is up in heaven with her nanny and grampy and other people that loved her'

Releasing the photo, she added: 'I am determined to focus on happy memories of Becky as a beautiful baby and gorgeous girl.

'I have been going through old photographs and she has a beaming smile in all of them. This is how she should be remembered - for her beauty inside and out.' 

Becky was last seen on February 19. Three days later, police began a missing persons investigation.  

Her dismembered body was found at a house in the Barton Hill area of the city, three miles away, on Monday March 2.

Yesterday, police confirmed that Becky's laptop, tablet computer and mobile phone - which went missing with the teenager - had been recovered.

Detective Superintendent Liz Tunks, the officer leading the investigation, said: 'There is likely to be ongoing police activity at properties in St George and Barton Hill for the next couple of weeks as part of our investigation into the murder of Becky Watts.

'There are specific forensic examinations which we need to complete to help establish exactly what happened to Becky.

'We'd like to reassure the local community that our primary aim is to conduct a meticulous and exhaustive inquiry into Becky's death and even though there have been charges brought in this case, it continues to be an active investigation.'

On Sunday, hundreds of multi-coloured balloons were released in Bristol in memory of Becky

Bouquets, teddies and cards have been left at the teenager's family home and mourners have attended churches across the city to pay their respects

Bouquets, teddies and cards have been left at the teenager's family home and mourners have attended churches across the city to pay their respects.

On Sunday, hundreds of multi-coloured balloons were released in memory of Becky at the weekend in an event attended by her father and stepmother. Some 400 people joined in with the event.

Bus drivers in Bristol also wore black on Monday as a mark of respect to the teenager.
