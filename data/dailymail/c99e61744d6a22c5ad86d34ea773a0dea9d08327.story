They are the moving words from a poem written at the start of the First World War and are still spoken every Remembrance Sunday.

‘They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them.’

Known as the Ode of Remembrance, the verse is from Lawrence Binyon’s 1914 poem For The Fallen which paid homage to the dead as British casualties mounted on the Western Front.

Poignant: The copy of the last stanza from For the Fallen that was handwritten by its author Lawrence Binyon

Rare: A handwritten copy of the Ode of Remembrance by poet Lawrence Binyon (right) is to go on sale at auction. Binyon may have scrawled the copy for a soldier serving amid the horror of the front line

The manuscript which will be auctioned at Bonhams is expected to be sold for £8,000

With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children,

England mourns for her dead across the sea.Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of spirit,Fallen in the cause of the free.Solemn the drums thrill: Death august and royalSings sorrow up into immortal spheres.There is music in the midst of desolationAnd a glory that shines upon our tears.They went with songs to the battle, they were young,Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted,They fell with their faces to the foe.They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old;Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.At the going down of the sun and in the morningWe will remember them.They mingle not with laughing comrades again;They sit no more at familiar tables of home;They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;They sleep beyond England's foam.But where our desires are and our hopes profound,Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,To the innermost heart of their own land they are knownAs the stars are known to the Night;As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain,As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness,To the end, to the end, they remain.

Now a rare copy of the verse, handwritten by Binyon during the war, is set to fetch £8,000 when it is sold at auction by Bonhams in London on April 10.

Binyon – too old to enlist, but who volunteered as a medical orderly – may have scrawled the copy, which is being sold by a collector of manuscripts, for a soldier serving amid the horror of the front line.

A spokesman for Bonhams, which is selling the manuscript, said: 'The copy for sale was written some time before 1918 on British Expeditionary Force (BEF) headed note-paper.

'When For the Fallen was first published in The Times in September 1914, casualties had started to mount and the promise of a speedy end to the war was already fading.

'The poem, and its final verse in particular, became and remains today a dignified and elegiac expression of national grief.'

The verse is being sold by Roy Davids, a collector of poetical manuscripts and a renowned expert.

No manuscript containing any part of For The Fallen has been sold at auction for at least 40 years.

Only six manuscripts of the poem are known to exist.

Lawrence Binyon was born in Lancaster in 1869.

At Oxford University he won the Newdigate prize for poetry and was influenced by the work of William Wordsworth.

Binyon published two major volumes of poetry: Lyric Poems (1894) and Odes (1901).

He wrote For the Fallen while working at the British Museum and did not go to the Western Front until 1916 when he went as a Red Cross orderly.

After the Armistice, Binyon returned to the British Museum printed books department where he was in charge of Oriental prints and paintings.

He was appointed Norton professor of poetry at Harvard in 1933.

The poet's later work included a translation of Dante's Divine Comedy before he died in 1943.
