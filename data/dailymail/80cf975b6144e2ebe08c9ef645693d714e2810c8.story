Alastair Cook has broken his silence on the reasons behind the sacking of Kevin Pietersen and insists the England dressing room will be better off without him.

The England captain, frustrated by the ECB’s insistence that he still cannot give his full side of the story for legal reasons, was at least able yesterday to back the decision to part with the gifted maverick in an attempt to restore team unity.

Cook was careful in what he said at the Essex media day but he realised it would be foolhardy if he ducked the opportunity to have his say on Pietersen with feelings running high in English cricket after a winter of utter discontent. That did not stop Pietersen's wife, former pop star Jessica Taylor, responding on Twitter to Cook's assertion that the decision took 'guts'.

‘I know it was the right decision,’ insisted Cook at Chelmsford when asked about the Pietersen sacking. ‘It was a brave call and it took a lot of guts to make it but people have been talking about it as if it just happened overnight. It didn’t.

‘The last thing that was intended was making Kevin a scapegoat for what happened in Australia. That’s not how it was at all.

'There comes a time when you do have to say ‘right, this is what we want moving forward’ and that was the decision taken. To say it was almost a call made by the toss of a coin is very wrong and disrespectful to the guys who made it.

‘A lot of effort went into getting him back in the side in the first place in 2012 and a lot of effort and thought went into the decision that has been made now.’

The mention of 2012 was, of course, extremely relevant as that was when Cook, along with Andy Flower, decided to give Pietersen one final chance despite the hurt and outrage caused by the text messages he sent to South African players criticising and insulting the then England captain Andrew Strauss.

Pietersen, who was suspended before returning to the England team in India, was given a final written warning and Sportsmail understands his behaviour deteriorated so much towards the end of the disastrous Ashes winter that the ECB now have a four-page dossier full of his various misdemeanours.

The presence of that document meant that Paul Downton, the new England managing director, was faced with a ‘no brainer’ of a decision to jettison Pietersen but it is the ECB’s questionable public relations policy since then that has seen flak thrown at the likes of Cook and Flower without the public knowing the full story. The captain insists that they will find out very soon.

Explanation: Cook insisted that the full version of events surrounding Pietersen's sacking will emerge in due course

‘I can’t answer questions about Kevin fully at the moment which is incredibly frustrating for me but there are a number of reasons why he went which will become clear,’ said Cook.

‘I know people will keep asking me about it but I hope everyone will understand the situation I’m in until we can give the answers. At the moment I just can’t.

‘If anyone thinks the decision was taken lightly without a lot of consideration and thought they’re wrong. A lot went into it and it was a tough decision. It will become clearer.’

Cook understands the need for the full story to come out sooner rather than later because, like Banquo’s ghost at the feast, Pietersen will always be in the background this summer haunting England while a legal gagging order prevails.

The confidentiality agreement signed by the ECB and Pietersen to cover the terms of his severance package expires at the end of September but for the good of all involved England need to find a way of fronting up fully before then.

The captain, who now has a chance to build a team in his own image and prove his strength as a leader, is adamant that the dressing room will be better now without Pietersen as England attempt to rebuild from the desperate depths they have plumbed, culminating in the final indignity of defeat by Holland.

‘Yes, moving forward that will be the way,’ said Cook when asked if the dressing room will now be a better place.

‘We all know how important team culture and unity are. We are in a results driven business but sometimes you have to get the basics in place first. I understand why the ECB have taken the stance they have but I just hope people can be patient with our explanation.’

When Cook returned from Australia after the successful Ashes tour in 2011, with the small matter of 766 Test runs to his name, he was a hero.

Now things could not be more different and the captain has the biggest challenge of his career to put right the wrongs of a disastrous six months.

‘When you lose 5-0 it’s almost as if people can’t bear to look at you and you feel embarrassed about it,’ Cook admitted. ‘But it can happen when you play sport at the highest level and, even though I don’t want to use the word cyclical, sometimes that’s what it is.

'When you don’t do yourself justice as a player it’s hugely frustrating. Sometimes the harder you try the worse it gets but that’s sport and it’s how you bounce back from those moments that defines you.

‘There have been times when I’ve struggled for runs and other times when I’ve found batting quite easy and I’ve been working very hard on my game in the last month and hopefully I’ll see the rewards of that.’

Cook will begin his own quest for form for Essex against Cambridge University at Fenner’s next week, providing all is well with the imminent arrival of his first child. He knows both him and England face a long journey back.

‘It is a new start, it has to be, and we have an opportunity now to begin again,’ said Cook. ‘That doesn’t mean we’re going to guarantee lots of good results because that’s not how sport works.

'We have to earn the right to get back where we were and we might have to do that with a totally different side.

‘Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss started out from a similar position to where we are now after we were bowled out for 51 in Jamaica and things take time.

'We played our best cricket as a side against India in 2011 and it took two-and-a-half years to build that momentum, learning how to win and with people feeling happy in the side. That’s how long it took to get that side playing to its peak so you can’t put a time frame on it.

'What I do know is that it won’t happen overnight and it will take a lot of work.’

He may have had the toughest of times and he may be frustrated at not being able to give his side of the Pietersen story but Alastair Cook remains a cricketer and a man of substance.

Most importantly, he dearly wants what is best for English cricket and he remains the best man, along with whichever new coach England choose, to put things right this summer.
