The widow of a church organist bludgeoned to death on his way to Midnight Mass said yesterday that she had no feelings of ‘hate and unforgiveness’ for his killers.

In an extraordinary act of compassion, Maureen Greaves refused to condemn Jonathan Bowling and Ashley Foster for their brutal and motiveless attack on her husband Alan, whom she described as her ‘soul mate’.

Instead, committed Christian Mrs Greaves, 63, insisted she would be praying for the thugs and hoped that ‘God’s great mercy will inspire them to true repentance’.

Distraught: Mrs Greaves' said Alan was 'devoted to loving God and loving the people he came into contact with'

Verdict: Ashley Foster, left, has been convicted of the manslaughter of Alan Greaves, right, who was attacked as he walked to church for midnight mass on Christmas Eve

Guilty: Jonathan Bowling, 22, had already admitted the murder of Alan Greaves

Her inspirational words came as a jury
found Foster guilty of the 68-year-old’s manslaughter, after his 
stepbrother Bowling had admitted murder.

The pair, both 22, were out ‘looking 
for trouble’ when they set upon Mr Greaves with a wooden pickaxe handle 
as he walked to St Saviour’s Church in High Green, Sheffield, to play 
the organ for Midnight Mass last Christmas Eve.

His body was found slumped against 
park railings with almost every bone in his face broken – similar 
injuries to those found in car crash victims. The pair ran away laughing
after the random attack, leaving him for dead on the pavement with 
catastrophic head injuries. Mrs Greaves, a mother of four and 
grandmother, watched her husband of 40 years die in hospital three days 
later.

During the trial she sat quietly 
through more than three weeks of evidence, but yesterday she broke down 
into sobs as the jury reached its verdict on Foster following 13 hours 
of deliberations.

She said: ‘Alan was a wonderful man 
who is so dearly missed. Our lives will never be the same again. Alan 
was a man who was driven by love and compassion and he would not want 
any of us to hold on to feelings of hate and unforgiveness. So in honour
of Alan and in honour of the God we both love my prayer is that this 
story doesn’t end today.

‘My prayer is that Jonathan Bowling 
and Ashley Foster will come to understand and experience the love and 
kindness of the God who made him in his own image and that God’s great 
mercy will inspire them to true repentance.’

Sheffield Crown Court heard how, after
the attack, Foster said Bowling grabbed his wrists and told him: 
‘That’s me being normal – imagine me going sick.’ Foster maintained that
he did not wield the pickaxe handle.

Court drama: There was confusion at Sheffield Crown Court when the clerk only asked the jury foreman for the murder verdict against Foster

Vicious: Following Foster's conviction, police have released this picture of the pick-axe handle used in Alan Greaves' murder

But the prosecution said that the pair
were ‘in it together’ and deliberately chose a dimly-lit area to launch
the savage attack.

Police said the killers came across 
their victim, a retired social worker, by chance because he had returned
to his house to fetch his hat. Robert Smith, QC, prosecuting, said: 
‘Their motive was not one of robbery, in short these two men were 
walking the streets looking for a suitable victim.

‘If it hadn’t been Mr Greaves it would
have been somebody else. They both intended to inflict really serious 
bodily harm to Mr Greaves.’

The pair, both unemployed, were 
arrested after being identified on CCTV footage released to the media 
showing them walking behind Mr Greaves.

Foster turned himself in to police 
after seeing the CCTV footage. He claimed he had not come forward before
because he was scared of Bowling.

Horrific: Mr Greaves was on his way to St Saviours C of E Church, High Green, when he was attacked

In the case of Bowling, he admitted 
murder after his DNA was discovered on a piece of wood from the murder 
weapon which was lodged in Mr Greaves’s head.

Bowling, of Burngreave, Sheffield and Foster of High Green, are expected to be sentenced today.

After the hearing Det Supt Matt 
Fenwick, who led the police inquiry, praised Mrs Greaves and her family 
for displaying ‘great strength and dignity in such ghastly 
circumstances’.

He said: ‘Alan was a man who worked 
all his life. He was a loving father and husband and he was the local 
church organist and did extensive charity work. It could have been 
anybody.

‘He was not targeted. That is the unpleasant part about this particular crime.’

Mrs Greaves, who works for the Church 
Army charity, added that her compassion for the killers had done nothing
to stop the constant pain she felt. ‘I used to be a happy and fulfilled
person who lived with my soul mate. Suddenly I am lonely and I have no 
one to talk to, as we did constantly.

‘I put my energy into getting through 
the tears and the crying each day. I don’t want people to think that 
because I can forgive, this has been an easy journey for me. The switch 
from being happily married to single has been horrific.’

Brutal: The scene where Mr Greaves' was attacked in the High Lane area of Sheffield last Christmas Eve

Community in shock: Local residents bring flowers and talk to police at the scene where Mr Greaves' was killed

He was a devout Christian whose kind nature endeared him to all he met.

They were two workshy thugs who smoked cannabis and terrorised their neighbourhoods.

The contrast between Alan Greaves and his killers could hardly have been more stark.

Memories: Mr Greaves' quiet and religious life was in deep contrast to his violent and senseless death

Happier times: Maureen Greaves described her husband as a 'truly beautiful man'

Mr Greaves, 68, described by friends 
as a ‘gentle soul’, dedicated his life to helping others – first as a 
social worker and then as a church organist.

His wife Maureen, also a social 
worker, said he often went ‘beyond the call of duty’ in looking after 
his clients and was involved in a host of community activities. Before 
he left his home for the last time, he brought her flowers and told her:
‘I love you so much, Maureen, and I’m so glad that I married you.’

Bereft: Maureen Greaves spoke movingly at the funeral of her husband Alan's funeral about how he would have advised her not to be angry with his killers

Meanwhile, Jonathan Bowling and Ashley
Foster had spent the day drinking and smoking cannabis and had headed 
out looking for trouble.

The stepbrothers lived near Mr 
Greaves. Neither had ever had a proper job and Bowling’s family was 
known to be on long-term benefits.

Bowling had been released from prison 
only in October, weeks before the killing. He has been jailed for a 
number of violent robberies and is said to have terrorised neighbours 
since the age of 13, with them even petitioning the council to have him 
removed.

Friends say he was expelled from 
secondary school on his first day and spent long spells of his teenage 
years in juvenile detention centres.

His mother Denise Sheppard, 55, who 
worked part-time in Poundland, was forced to hand him over to police at 
least once and threw him out aged 16. He is said to have been given an 
Asbo and banned from coming into the neighbourhood, but he ignored it.

He met his sidekick at the age of 11 
when his father, convicted wife-beater Leslie, 46, struck up a 
relationship with Foster’s mother, Nicole Casey.

Despite Foster painting himself as an 
innocent party in court, locals say he was banned from pubs and shops in
his neighbourhood.

Bowling’s estranged uncle, Robert 
Allan, 49, a roofer, said: ‘He may be my flesh and blood but he deserves
to be strung up for what he did to that old man.’ An acquaintance of 
the murderer added: ‘He’s the kind that will see a life sentence as a 
badge of honour.’
