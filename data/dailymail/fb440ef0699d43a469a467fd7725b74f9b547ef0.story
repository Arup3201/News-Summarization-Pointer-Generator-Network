Working for progress: Al Sharpton (above) met with Amy Pascal in New York Thursday to discuss the lack of diversity in Hollywood

Shamed: This over a week after leaked emails showed a racist exchange about President Obama between Sony head Pascal (above) and producer Scott Rudin

'Very pointed and blunt exchange w/Amy Pascal in our 90 min meeting,' he tweeted. 

'Hollywood needs to change. Her leaked e mails show a cultural blindness.'

He later held a news conference and appeared on Politics Nation where he revealed that Sony was creating a 'working group' to discuss and address the lack of racial diversity in Hollywood.

This after Pascal's racist emails went public.  

On the eve of a fundraising breakfast in November 2013 being attended by the President at the home of DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, Pascal and Rudin went over things she could discuss with Obama while at the event.

'Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?' Pascal asks Rudin, a reference to the 2012 Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained that dealt with the subject of slavery in the antebellum South.

'12 years,' responds Rudin, referencing another slavery film, this time Steve McQueen's 2013 Academy Award-winning work 12 Years a Slave, a very violent and brutal look at the injustice and abuse endured by the millions forced into slavery in America.

The pair then keep going, listing as many current films starring black actors as they can name, including Lee Daniels' The Butler and two Kevin Hart movies, Think Like a Man and Ride Along.

'I bet he likes Kevin Hart,' says Rudin at one point.

Pascal issued an apology saying: 'The content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am.'

She then added, 'although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.' 

Sharpton released his own statement at the time, saying; 'These emails nominate Amy Pascal to be considered by some of us in the same light that we concluded and moved on the ownership of Donald Sterling of the L.A. Clippers.'
