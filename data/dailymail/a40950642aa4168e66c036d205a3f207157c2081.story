Babies with ‘three parents’ could be created in British laboratories within two years, it emerged yesterday.

The UK fertility regulator said there was no evidence that the controversial technique would be unsafe, but called for extra checks before approving it for use.

These could take up to two years. However, some leading scientists said that no time is to be lost in changing the law to allow women to be treated.

This would make Britain the first 
country in the world to sanction the creation of babies that effectively
 have three parents – two mothers and a father.

Supporters
 say it will give couples who have endured the heartache of repeatedly 
miscarrying or burying much longed-for children the option of having a 
healthy family.

But critics argue that genetically engineering eggs and embryos crosses a crucial ethical line.

Done differently, it could lead to the creation of ‘perfect’ babies, made to order by hair or eye colour.

Mitochondria are tiny powerhouses in cells
 that generate energy and have a small amount of their own DNA, separate
 from the bulk of the human genetic code.

Defects in mitochondrial 
DNA (mtDNA) are responsible for a host of inherited diseases, including 
conditions leading to muscle wasting, heart problems, loss of vision, 
organ failure and epilepsy.

MR treatment, which employs two different
 IVF techniques, aims to prevent these diseases by giving babies healthy
 mtDNA from donor eggs.

The baby is born with normal 'nuclear' DNA 
passed down by its parents - containing most inherited traits such as 
eye and hair colour and height - plus a tiny amount of mtDNA donated by a
 second donor 'mother'.

In effect the baby has three genetic parents, though the donated mtDNA contains less than 1 per cent of its genes.

Since
 the healthy mtDNA would be inherited by future generations, the 
treatment has the potential to eradicate mitochondrial diseases from 
affected families.

Critics argue that allowing the treatments could be the first step down a slippery slope towards 'designer babies'.

The
 controversy surrounds work being carried out at Newcastle University 
into incurable diseases caused by mitochondria – the tiny sausage-shaped
 powerhouses inside cells that turn food into energy.

These
 defects cause serious illness in one in 6,500 babies and are 
responsible for 50 genetic diseases, many of which kill in infancy.

Women
 carrying damaged mitochondria can also miscarry repeatedly and often 
face the heartbreaking choice of whether it would be best to remain 
childless.

To help them, 
scientists have developed techniques in which the mother-to-be’s 
diseased mitochondria are swapped with healthy ones from an egg donated 
by another woman. Successful ‘mitochondrial replacement’ would allow the
 couple a healthy child that is genetically their own.

As the changes 
would be passed down the generations, it would also eliminate the 
disease from future generations of the family.

Any
 child would have DNA from two eggs and one sperm – and so effectively 
have two mothers and one father - although the genetic contribution from
 the donated egg would be very small. The Government has already given 
the treatment its backing and published draft rules that will allow it –
 if Parliament agrees.

And 
it had been predicted that the law could be changed by the end of this 
year. But yesterday, a study by the fertility watchdog, the Human 
Fertilisation & Embryology Authority, urged caution.

The
 authors said that while they have not seen any evidence that the 
techniques are unsafe, crucial research needed to be done, before the 
first women are treated.

Panel
 chairman Dr Andy Greenfield said: ‘The scientific questions that we 
examined and the research that we examined – and it was voluminous – 
will never answer all of the critical questions. And, of course it won’t
 answer the fundamental question, which is are these techniques safe and
 efficacious in humans.’

Three parents: The techniques involve replacing defective DNA in the mother's egg with material from a donor egg. This means the resulting healthy child would effectively have two mothers and a father

However,
 he added that the same sort of safety questions existed before the 
birth of Louise Brown, the world’s first test-tube baby.

Dr David King, of campaign group Human Genetics Alert, said the techniques ‘open the door to a designer baby future’.

Newcastle
 University described the report as ‘very encouraging’ but couldn’t say 
when it would be ready to treat the first woman.
