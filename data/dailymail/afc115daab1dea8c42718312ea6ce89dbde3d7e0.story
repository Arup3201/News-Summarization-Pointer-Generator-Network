The hope or fear, depending on one's outlook, that Red Bull are imploding just as Ferrari did to some degree at the close of the Michael Schumacher era seem far-fetched.

Ferrari lost all their star men in quick succession: Jean Todt, the team principal, Ross Brawn, the technical director, Rory Byrne, the chief designer, and Schumacher himself. The Germanic, English and, to an extent, French pragmatism vanished.

The dangers inherent in this were summed up colourfully by Niki Lauda when he said: 'The English were the bridge between the Germans, with their rigid, inflexible style, and the Italians, who only understand spaghetti and romance.'

Second fiddle: Red Bull have won the last four drivers' and constructors' titles but have fallen behind Mercedes

Red Bull are not in Ferrari's position despite the news that Adrian Newey, the star designer of his age, is taking on extra responsibilities with Red Bull Technology projects and will have only 'a small say' in next year's car and act as an adviser thereafter.

Although Newey has been granted the new challenges he sought to revitalise himself at 55, he will remain on hand.

'Adrian can switch the dial up when he wants,' said Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal. For now at least, Sebastian Vettel, their outstanding driver, is staying (though the rumour mill continues to link him with Ferrari).

Horner, the shrewd architect of eight championships in four years, also remains. His skills as a tap dancer were again to the fore in the latest Newey deal: with Ferrari sniffing around, he gave his leading technician what he wanted, thereby ensuring that even if Red Bull were not going to get Newey's undivided attention, nor was anyone else in the paddock.

The broadening of Red Bull's involvement also handily answers the accusation that they are nothing more than a drinks company, an advertisement for a brand of liquid sugar and caffeine.

They are putting down roots in the engineering world. The exact nature of their plans for Red Bull Technology will only be revealed later this year, but Newey's involvement in America's Cup yachting is something that he and Sir Ben Ainslie, the country's finest sailor, both welcome.

This season's Mercedes dominance shows that sport is partly cyclical. But this shift of power, and Newey's redefined role, need not betoken a permanent end to Red Bull as we know them.

On track: Mercedes won the opening six races before Daniel Ricciardo's win for Red Bull at the Canadian GP

'Cybernats' was not a word I had heard before reading the coverage of JK Rowling's £1million donation to help save the United Kingdom from Scottish independence.

These 'cybernats' – the supporters of nationalism who direct abuse online at those who question their cause – made menacing threats against the author for daring to hold a view different from theirs. The Mail deemed some of the Twitter vitriol to be unprintable in a family newspaper.

But we did record how one intellectual contributor to the debate boasted that he would 'do time for this'.

Another constitutional expert vouchsafed the following: 'JK Rowling can f*** off! Money should have been donated to FoodBanks!! #VoteYes'

Under attack: Threats were made towards JK Rowling after her £1m donation to help save the UK from Scottish independence

This is not the place to discuss the merits of keeping the UK together, but the episode provides a parallel with how issues in modern sport are discussed online.

I make a point of not reading comments below stories I write, so not to be swayed by the positive or negative responses, and trust they are all sweetness and light, rhyme and reason.

But I have heard of a death threat – however serious the intent – being issued to at least one colleague.

Readers viciously insult each other, too. Reason is trampled over. This coarsening of sporting discourse, often along tribal lines, especially in football, is a disease.

Formula One is not immune. Here is an exchange I found within seconds of looking on the F1 pages of another newspaper website.

Jake Harods, challenged about his achievements in life, left this comment: 'I am not telling you nothing:) I suspect better than yours.....and my gf is prettier than your wife ....and Lewis is still faster than Jenslow :).' 

Someone who exquisitely calls himself Adolf Galland weighed in with his pearls: 'You are truly pathetic. Even a brainless, spineless, ignorant 10 year old troll could come up better comments than you.'

Such epigrams. Perhaps we should remind the trolls that sport is all about opinions, which should be given and taken with a degree of proportion. It is not a matter of life and death (threats).

Raring to go: McLaren posted this picture of 1976 World Champion James Hunt earlier this week

In black and white: Hunt playing squash

An addendum to the suggestive picture McLaren issued this week of James Hunt in training. His second favourite means of keeping fit was playing squash. He would frequently arrive late for a fixture at his club, the Royal Automobile.

'Often I would be in the changing room fretting until I heard the clip, clip, clip of his shoes as he came down the staircase,' recalled John Hopkins, a journalist and fellow RAC member.

'The next moment he would burst in full of apologies. "Some silly sod tried to carve me up going round Clapham Common. I had to sort him out. I took him on the next bend. He didn't know whether he was coming or going. Served him right."'

Hopkins, who wrote A Celebration of 100 Years of Squash at Pall Mall, added: 'His technique was individual, based on fast darting steps around the court accompanied by the odd expletive. With his hair flying he chased every shot, ricocheting off the side walls, gasping for breath. Living his squash to the full as he did his life.

'He was not stylish but that did not matter because he never knew when he was beaten. An added bonus was that over dinner he would recount tales of fast cars and beautiful women. Or was it the other way round?' Hunt died 21 years ago this weekend.

Reports: There were some suggestions in the Italian media that Lewis Hamilton visited Maranello this week

The most curious story of the week was a report in the Italian press that Lewis Hamilton secretly visited Ferrari's factory in Maranello.

So far as I can tell, it was erroneous. His management insist he was still in Canada at the time. But I can reveal that Hamilton has been a regular customer of Ferrari, going back to his McLaren days. He likes their road cars, not unreasonably.

Congratulations to Daniel Ricciardo on winning the Canadian Grand Prix. He was a popular victor. But how does his form impact on the reputation of Sebastian Vettel, the four-time world champion?

I suggest we wait a little longer before re-opening the debate over whether the German has been flattered by his cars and is really little better than average.

Winner: Australian Daniel Ricciardo celebrated his first grand prix victory at the last race in Montreal

He drove brilliantly for long periods of his championship-winning seasons and those achievements dwarf a mere seven poor-to-mediocre races.

One further thought if were to downgrade Vettel, where would it leave his team-mate of those four years, Mark Webber?

The FIA this week announced it has signed the Brighton Declaration on Women and Sport, committing itself to 'increase the involvement of women in sport at all levels and in all functions and roles'. Laudable, but I've yet to hear a response from the Grid Girls Union.
