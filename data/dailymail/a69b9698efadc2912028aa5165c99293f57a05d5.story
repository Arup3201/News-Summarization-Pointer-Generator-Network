Lloyd Dobrodumow, 45, admitted attacking Robert Smith after he dropped a can outside his shop

A hairdresser who once called himself 'The Demon Barber' has escaped jail after he slashed a man's neck with a cut-throat razor during a fight over littering. 

Lloyd Dobrodumow, 45, attacked Robert Smith after he dropped a can of beer outside his shop - Jack's in Newcastle - and left him with a 10cm wound to his throat.

Newcastle Crown Court heard that Dobrodumow, who was carrying a razor, asked him to put the can in the bin before punching him with the blade still in his hand. 

Mr Smith, who was left bleeding from his neck, was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in the city and underwent surgery to repair the wound. 

Neil Pallister, prosecuting, said the defendant was at work with his wife and a female employee on June 10 at 5pm when the victim had been walking from the train station towards the shop.

Mr Smith was carrying a plastic bag with alcohol in it and was drinking from a can.

He said: 'He finished drinking from the can and tossed the can away. He recalls hearing a males voice saying, "The bin is only f****** there."

'Hearing this Mr Smith walks towards the defendant who was standing in the doorway of his shop.'

An argument then broke out between the two men and various witnesses saw Dobrodumow trying to close the door of his shop but Mr Smith placed his foot in the door.

Eventually Dobrodumow, who once ran a shop called The Demon Barber in Newcastle city centre, came out of his shop and witnesses saw Mr Smith swing the bag of lager at him. 

Dobrodumow then punched him in the face across his jaw with the hand in which he was holding the razor.

Blood began to soak Mr Smith's T-shirt and witnesses then heard him demanding £10,000 from Dobrodumow to 'make it all go away'.

The court heard Mr Smith was taken to hospital where he was immediately rushed into surgery as the main muscle had been cut and his saliva gland cut in two.

Mr Pallister said Dobrodumow had a long history of domestic violence and had 17 previous convictions.

But Toby Hedworth QC, defending, said Dobrodumow had been victim of a long series of anti-social behaviour outside his shop and had come to the end of his tether.

Mr Hedworth said: 'Since moving to this part of the world from Yorkshire he has changed his behaviour, he's matured and he's kept himself clear from the kind of behaviour which categorised his life 15 years ago.

'The defendant acknowledges there became a stage after he had been significantly provoked that he had been seeking to defend himself and his occupants in the shop.

'He acknowledges that punching out when he did that particular act went past self-defence.

'He was reckless in that he had forgotten he had the razor in his hand.

'The defendant was immediately on the phone to the emergency services.

'He acknowledges that this is behaviour that although provoked is beyond what is acceptable.' 

He also said witnesses had heard Mr Smith threatening to kill him, steal his dog and call his wife a slut. He also said he had showed 'genuine tearful remorse' after the incident.

Judge Tom Little accepted that there had been no intent in the injury as the blade was something he used every day at work and he did not realise it was still in his hand at the time.

'I have agonised long and hard about this decision and I'm just persuaded to suspend the sentence,' he said.

'I do this for the remorse you have shown which in my judgment is genuine.'

Dobrodumow, of Bensham in Gateshead, admitted unlawful wounding and was given a 12 month suspended sentence, a 12 month supervision requirement with 200 hours of unpaid work.

He was also told to pay £5,000 compensation and £700 costs.
