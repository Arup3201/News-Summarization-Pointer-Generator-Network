The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is set to direct airlines to avoid flying Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 747-8 jumbo jets with General Electric engines near thunderstorms after some planes experienced ice buildup in their engines.

The U.S. regulator said it would issue an airworthiness directive (AD) this week for the airplanes powered by GE's GEnx engines.

'The AD is an interim action to make sure pilots avoid icing conditions that could affect engine power and possibly damage the engine,' said FAA.

Warning: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is set to tell airlines to avoid flying new Boeing Dreamliners near thunderstorms after some planes experience an ice build-up on the engine including Japan Airlines

The FAA also said it has been working
closely with Boeing and GE to monitor and understand these events as 
the companies develop a permanent solution.

The
787 can be powered by either GEnx engines or rival Trent 1000 engines 
made by Rolls-Royce Plc, while the 747-8 is powered exclusively by the 
GE engine model.

Took action: Japan Airlines pulled Boeing 787s from two international routes amid concerns about ice

Boeing 
advised airlines on Friday about a risk of engine icing problems on 
747-8 and 787 Dreamliner planes with GE engines, urging 15 carriers to 
avoid flying them near high-altitude thunderstorms.

The problem was caused by a build-up of ice crystals - initially just behind the front fan - which spread through the engine.

Airlines
affected by the warning included Japan Airlines, Lufthansa, United 
Airlines, a unit of United Continental Holdings and Cathay Pacific 
Airlines. The warning even led Japan Airlines to pull 787 Dreamliners 
from two international routes.

Boeing
spokesman Marc Birtel said the company has already alerted its 
customers who operate some GE-powered engines on 747-8 and 787 models.

'To
reduce chances of ice crystal conditions, Boeing recommends that 
operators fly at least 50 nautical miles from thunderstorms that may 
contain ice crystals,' said Birtel.

So far, Boeing has delivered 57 747-8s and 58 787s with GEnx engines, Birtel said.

A GE spokesman said: 'The aviation 
industry is experiencing a growing number of ice-crystal icing 
encounters in recent years as the population of large commercial 
airliners has grown, particularly in tropical regions of the world.'

He added that GE and Boeing are attempting to modify the engine control system software in a bid to eliminate the problem.

It is the latest in a spate of mishaps 
for the 787, which has previously experienced issues with power supply, 
brakes, oil and fan shaft, as well as plane fires.

The 787 - the first passenger jet built mainly from lightweight carbon-composites.- incorporates a raft of changes in the
way passenger jets are designed, including greater use of electrical 
systems that save weight compared with older hydraulics.

It has suffered a spate of disasters since it was introduced to commercial airlines in 2011.

In
July, a 787 jet operated by Ethiopian Airlines caught fire on the 
runway at Heathrow - forcing the closure of the entire airport.

Disaster: Earlier this year, a parked Ethiopian Boeing 787 Dreamliner caught fire at Heathrow airport

Closure: The fire kept the airport shut for 90 minutes and was caused by a fault in the lithium battery powering the plane's emergency beacon
