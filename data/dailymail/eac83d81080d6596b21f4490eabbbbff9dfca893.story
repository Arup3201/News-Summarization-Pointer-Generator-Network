Magician Ivan Russell, 42, abused four boys and one girl at the holiday camps he worked in

A magician who performed at holiday camps for 18 years has been jailed for abusing children he groomed with his magic tricks.

Ivan Russell, 42, targeted vulnerable families at the resorts and used his magic skills to befriend them before abusing the children.

The 'predatory paedophile' abused four boys and one girl, aged between eight and 15, while working at camps in Great Yarmouth, Northamptonshire and Lancashire.

He has been jailed for six years and the judge branded him the 'most selfish man I have ever come across'.

Northamptonshire Crown Court heard some of the children were 'in awe' of Russell and he was able to persuade them to perform sex acts on him.

He plied one boy with alcohol before abusing him.

In another incident he told one mother, who had alcohol problems, that her child could stay with him before abusing the boy.

The court heard the victim is left 'unable to trust anyone with his own children'.

The offences, which dated back to 1994, only came to light in 2010 when one of his victims came forward.

Judge Rupert Mayo said Russell was a 'predatory paedophile' as he jailed him Northampton Crown Court

Russell, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was convicted of 12 counts of indecent assault, one charge of indecency with a child and four charges of sexual assault on a child at a separate hearing in February.

Jailing Russell on Friday, Judge Rupert Mayo said: 'He is one of the most selfish individuals I have ever come across.

'My firm conclusion is that he poses an immediate and continuing danger to children.'

Russell will spend four years on licence when he is released from prison and will remain on the Sex Offenders’ Register for life.

Speaking after the hearing, one of 
Russell’s victims, who cannot be named, said: 'It is all over and done 
with, he is where he belongs.'

Russell was not in court to hear the sentence because he was unwell.

Detective
Constable Lisa Miller, from Northamptonshire Police’s Child Abuse 
Investigation Unit, said the case had been 'very difficult' for all the 
victims.

She said that Russell may have abused other children and urged them to contact the force.
