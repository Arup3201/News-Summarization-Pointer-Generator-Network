Five people have been arrested after a Chinese student was found beaten to death in his apartment near University of Southern California.

Xinran Ji, 24, an engineering student at USC, was attacked while walking near 29th Street and Orchard Avenue at 12.45pm in Los Angeles, California, last Thursday.

Los Angeles Police said Ji was attacked with an 'unknown blunt object' but managed to stumble back to his apartment block where he was found dead later that morning.

Officers discovered Ji’s body around 
7am on Thursday on the fourth floor of the City Park apartments in the 
1200 block of W. 30th Street at 7:11 a.m. located north of the campus.

His family have been notified of his death.

Speaking
 at a press conference yesterday, police said the five people who had 
been arrested included three juveniles and two adults.

Four of those have been arrested on suspicion of homicide and the other on suspicion of robbery.

Speaking at a press conference 
yesterday, LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith 'detectives were 'pulling out all the
 stops to get this thing wrapped up.'

'It's a very high priority for us to make sure that we take these guys into custody,' he added.

Ji's murder has prompted fears over the safety of USC for international students in the area.

In 2012, Ying Wu and Ming Qu, electrical engineering program students, were shot to death around 1am while sitting in a parked BMW a mile away from USC, just west of campus.

The parents of the two students later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the university, saying the school misled them when it claimed that it ranks 'among the safest in the nation.'

In February 2014, Bryan Barnes, 21, pleaded guilty to the students murder and was immediately sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.

The victim's distraught parents said their children's murders had caused 'endless pain.'

XiYong, father of the murdered Ying Wu, 
said her killing 'shattered the dream and hope of our entire family into
 pieces and pushed us into the abyss of endless pain. '

Wanzhi Qu, father of Ming Qu, described his son as a straight-A student gifted in piano and vocal performances.

But the school has claimed it is safe.

In a letter posted on the school’s website, USC Senior Vice President Elizabeth Garrett insisted that Ji's murder ‘was an isolated incident and there is no apparent threat to the campus community.'

Pete Foster, an officer with the university’s Department of Public Safety, added that 'any area around USC is really safe.'

USC has the largest number of international students among any college in the United States.

Six months after the deaths of Wu and Qu a gunman opened fire in a crowd outside a Halloween party near the centre of the university.

Four people were wounded and the campus was cordoned off.

However, Los Angeles police and USC officials claimed that the shooting was due to an argument between two people who were not affiliated with university.

Afterwards, multiple security measures were put in place to beef up security.

A fence was put up along the school's perimeter, and security guards began checking identification cards after 9pm.

Another measure included limited access for the public between 9pm and 6pm, when only staff members, students and registered guests were allowed to visit.

Fingerprint scanners, security cameras and licence plate readers were also introduced which led to a fall in reported crimes in 2013.

However, some students still feel unsafe.

Joe Benson, a senior undergraduate student told The Los Angeles Times: 'It's shocking, but at the same time you're almost desensitized because you're like, 'Are you kidding me? It happened again?

Blaming lapse security, he added: 'What they're doing now isn't working.'

According to students, the victim’s apartment complex was popular among international students because it was considered to be safe.

USC's Dean of the Viterbi School of 
Engineering Yannis Yortsos said in a statement: 'This news hits me very 
deeply. On behalf of the School, my heartfelt condolences go out to the 
family and friends of the victim.

Yortsos said university officials have spoken to Ji's family and had made arrangements for them to travel to Los Angeles.
