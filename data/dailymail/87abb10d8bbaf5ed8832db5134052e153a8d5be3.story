Innocent: Ruth Levy, 77, was prevented from sending the card because M&S thought she was being rude

When Ruth Levy went online to create a personalised birthday card for a 90-year-old friend called Dick, it turned out his common name of yesteryear has been banned as a modern profanity.

After typing in her message to her friend of 50 years, 77-year-old Mrs Levy was turned down and warned by the Marks & Spencer website against using bad language.

Horrified, the tech-savvy grandmother closely checked the e-card for typing slip-ups, but still could not get approval for: ‘Many happy returns on your significant birthday.’

But after complaining to the store, she was told her card had been banned simply because her friend’s name was Dick – the shortened version of Richard.

Mrs Levy, from Turnham Green, West London, said yesterday yesterday said she was ‘completely surprised’ by Mark and Spencer’s ban.

‘When it came up with, “Your message cannot contain profanity”, I didn’t get it. I’m obviously too innocent. I thought it must be the word “significant” that it thought was dodgy, but it still would not accept it. I tried various ways, taking out bits of text, but it still said no.

‘After I wrote to M&S to ask what I had done wrong, I could not believe it when they sent me a prissy letter saying it was because my friend is called Dick.

‘It is political correctness gone absolutely mad.’

Marks & Spencer told her in the letter that the card had been banned ‘to avoid the system being used to harass by containing profanity’. It added: ‘Sadly the word showing as profanity in your card is Richard’s name.’

The firm’s only suggestion was that Mrs Levy called her friend Richard. Instead, Mrs Levy sent Dick - a friend of more than fifty years - a card by post.

Mrs Levy regularly sends e-cards because of their convenience. She said: ‘I send e-cards because it is a nice and easy way of doing things. I usually use an American site, but none of their cards were sober enough to send to a 90-year-old. They were all far too brash and lively.

‘I picked an innocuous card on the M&S website. It’s the first time I have used them. I shan’t again. I don’t mind them weeding out profanities – I’m glad for my grandsons to be shielded from the horrors of the internet – but it should not be beyond the wit of man to have a system that knows Dick is a name.’

Mrs Levy, a former interior designer, who has been using the internet at home since 1995, and browses using her computer, iPad and smartphone added: ‘It is amazing how fast things have changed and advanced, but obviously too fast for M&S.’

A Marks & Spencer spokesman said: ‘We must ensure out system is robust to protect our content standards.’

Rules: M&S also said: 'We understand that the customer did not intend to cause offence'
