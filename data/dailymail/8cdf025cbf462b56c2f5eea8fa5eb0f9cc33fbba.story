Spain legend Xavi has confirmed he will step down from international duty to concentrate on club football, and said he hopes to be welcoming new team-mate Luis Suarez to Barcelona sooner rather than later.

After over 100 games for the national team winning two European Championships and a World Cup the midfielder, widely recognised as the country’s greatest ever player, said: 'I leave the Spain team a very happy man and I desire them all the best.'

It did appear in the summer that he would also be turning his back on Barcelona but he finally committed himself to the club and speaking on Tuesday at the club's Joan Gamper training complex he said Barca players would be waiting with ‘open arms’ to welcome new signing Suarez as soon as his ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini was served.

The veteran 34-year-old said of Suarez's pending appeal, due to be heard at the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne on Friday: 'It’s a spectacular signing. He had an incredible season with Liverpool and we hope that the sanction is reduced. I know him personally and he is a great person.

'He has apologised for what happened [at the World Cup] so we hope the appeal is successful.'

The Barcelona captain – who will find out on Tuesday if he remains captain after a team vote – also admitted it was talks with Sporting Director, Andoni [Zubizarreta] and Luis Enrique that persuaded him that he still had a role to play.

'I’m I’m not 20 any more but I still have the same desire. I feel really good and I’m very happy to be carrying on,' he said.

Xavi was one of Barcelona’s three captain’s last season with Carles Puyol and Victor Valdes and with the other two now gone from the club, players will vote on a new trio of leaders to take them through this season.

Xavi said: 'We voted this morning and I will accept what is best for the group.'

He does not expect to play every week and so is unlikely to be named first captain but should still feature in the three named.

'[Leo] Messi is still the best in the world,' he said of his Argentine team-mate who returned to training on Tuesday and is also likely to be one of the players sharing the armband. But the Spain armband will definitely never been worn by him again.

Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher tweeted: 'Xavi Hernandez retires from international football as the best central midfielder I've ever seen. What a player what a man!'
