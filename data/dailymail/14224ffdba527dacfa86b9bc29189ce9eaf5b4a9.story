A vicious brawl which allegedly occurred on a city trolley in Philadelphia is now under investigation after video footage of the event was leaked on social media.

YouTube user Brian Gregory candidly filmed the apparent attack, where one man is seen on the ground being kicked while a woman in the background gets hit on the head.

The attackers are heard hurling profanity-laced abuse at their victims before it's announced that the police are coming and they flee the scene.

The incident took place on Saturday night around 11:20pm. 

Other commuters are seen looking helpless as the violent scene kicks off.

A spokesperson for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority told MailOnline that the fight was between high school students who were known to each other and, by chance, met on the westbound route 10 trolley.

The two victims are not cooperating with the current investigation in process.

Their condition is unknown but in the YouTube video there did not appear to be any bloodshed. 

The assailants fled before the police arrived. 

It's estimated that more than 100,000 school students use SEPTA buses, trolleys and trains every day. 

Transport representatives say that fights between students are fairly common and extra officers are usually placed on duty at the end of school days.
