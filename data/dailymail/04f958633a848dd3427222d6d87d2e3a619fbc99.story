Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid shocked Washington by withdrawing support for President Barack Obama's minimum wage proposal on Tuesday, showing that Democrats are getting cold feet following a devastating report that predicted massive job losses if the wage floor were to rise.

But while the Democratic leader has withdraw the measure from the Senate calendar, leading liberals in the House of Representatives are preparing an attempt to force a minimum wage vote over the objections of House Speaker John Boehner and conservative Republicans.

Raising the minimum wage was expected to be the centerpiece of the Obama administration's 2014 agenda, and White House surrogates planned just a week ago to spend the last days of February arguing in favor of the initiative.

But Reid and Obama hit a roadblock on Feb. 18 when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report predicting a loss of 500,000 jobs by 2016 as a consequence of a $10.10 minimum wage.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid yanked the president's national minimum wage proposal from the Senate calendar this week, admitting defeat -- at least for now

Executive action: President Obama went around Congress on Feb. 12 to sign an order raising the minimum wage to $10.10 for employees of federal contractors, but he's powerless to do more without backing from lawmakers

Combined with a labor participation rate at its lowest point since 1978, Capitol Hill insiders say the news made all momentum vanish.

'Harry Reid simply can't move forward with this idea unless he wants to surrender the Senate in November,' a senior aide to a Senate Republican told MailOnline on Wednesday.

'There's just no way he's going to go down in history as a greater job-killer than he already is.'

Democrats already run the risk of losing control of the Senate this year, with some prognosticators saying Republicans will pick up as many as 10 seats, more than the six they need in order to return in 2015 as the majority.

That scenario would put all of Congress in GOP hands, turning President Obama into an instant lame duck and killing his chances of passing legacy-building legislation during his final two years in office.

Labor unions have lobbied for years to raise the current minimum of $7.25 per hour, arguing that a full-time job at that wage puts most earners below the federal government's poverty line.

But academic research shows that most minimum wage earners are not heads of households, and few earn the minimum for very long.

Labor unions have organized strikes and demonstrations in U.S. cities, demanding higher wages for service industry workers, farmhands and other low-paid employees

In addition, many organized labor contracts include scores of higher salaries that are indexed to the minimum wage, meaning that they would also rise – winning union leaders plaudits from the rank and file and greater legitimacy at a time when private-sector union membership has dwindled to just 6.7 per cent.

Only 32 of the Senate's 55 Democrats have signed on to Sen. Tom Harkin's bill, written to carry the president's minimum wage agenda.

Pressing the issue: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi plans a maneuver to force a minimum wage vote on the House floor, but needs at least 18 Republicans to support her

And most Democrats who have backed away from Reid are facing difficult re-election bids, The Hill reported on Wednesday.

Those vulnerable senators include Mark Warner of Virginia, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.

The sole liberal contrarian is Sen. Mark Begich, a red-state Democrat from Alaska who leads in the polls but expects a tough fight in November.

Begich, however, has already distanced himself from President Obama. On Jan. 29 he told CNN that he's 'not really interested' in having the president campaign for him.

'I don't need him campaigning for me,' he said. 'I need him to change some of his policies.'

Republicans have jumped on the Feb. 18 report as new ammunition in the national fight over jobs, already tilting in their favor because of another CBO report that predicted that the Affordable Care Act would trim the equivalent of millions of full-time jobs from the U.S. economy.

'You couple that with CBO’s estimate of 2.3 million fewer jobs created under Obamacare and you’ve got a pretty big hit on an economy that is already suffering from way too much joblessness,' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday of the minimum wage report.

'The last thing we need to be doing right now in our country is passing legislation that destroys even more jobs.'

White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman told reporters during a hastily planned Feb. 18 conference call that employers dissatisfied with a new minimum wage didn't necessarily need to trim jobs.

Instead of eliminating positions in the face of a static salary pool, he argued, company owners should take into account 'the overall benefits for productivity, plus the other margins on which firms can adjust – for example, reduced profits.'

The wrath of John: Speaker Boehner would not look kindly on Republicans who cross the aisle to support a 'discharge petition' that would overrule him and put Obama's minimum wage legislation up for a vote

The CBO found that as many as 1 million jobs might be lost after a minimum wage hike to $10.10 per hour, but determined that its 'central estimate' was 500,000 jobs

Reid is putting on a brave face, vowing to bring the bill back in November – perhaps in a lame duck session after the fall election – if members of his own party keep balking.

But while senators in job-protection mode dither, House Democrats led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are planning an unusual maneuver to force a minimum wage vote.

Boehner has said he won't bring the bill to the floor because fewer than half of the Republicans in his caucus want it. But Democrats, betting that enough in the GOP would favor a vote, are preparing a 'discharge petition.'

That measure would force a floor vote if at least 218 of the 435 House members supported it. With 199 Democrats already locked in, 18 Republicans would have to join them.

While there are likely at least that many who would feel pressure from their constituents to vote in favor of a final bill, any Republican who supports a Democratic discharge position would risk the wrath of Boehner, whose power extends to crucial fundraising help and committee assignments.

'It's a nonstarter,' a House aide told MailOnline,' asking for anonymity. 'If Pelosi wants to force the issue she's going to be sorely disappointed.'

'It will keep the minimum wage in the news for a bit longer, though.'
