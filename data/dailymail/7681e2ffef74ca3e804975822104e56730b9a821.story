Two men dressed as superhoes saved a cat from dying in a burning West Virginia home Saturday.

Batman and Captain America, aka John Buckland and Troy Marcum, had been working a children's event nearby when they saw smoke engulfing the Milton home.

The dynamic duo rushed to see if anyone was inside the home and that's when they foudn the lucky kitty.

Where's Catwoman? Two Milton, West Virginia men dressed as Batman and Captain America swooped into a burning home and rescued a stranded cat Saturday

Real life heroes: Batman and Captain America, or John Buckland and Troy Marcum just happened to be in the area of a house engulfed in smoke and jumped into action like superheroes

Professional: Jeff Buckland, aka Batman, runs Heroes 4 Higher, which sends superheroes to events where they teach children positive lessons

Buckland runs an organization called Heroes for Higher that uses costumed avengers to spread positive messages to kids.

He and Marcum had been at a nearby American Legion and when they saw the fire, they knew it was time to turn their teachings into action.

'I grabbed his shoulders, gave it everything we got and the door opened,' Buckland told West Virginia ABC affiliate WCHS.

Buckland is a former firefighter and Iraq veteran and said his training kicked in and they immediately smashed out a window.

Trapped: As flames ripped through the Milton, West Virginia home, Buckland and Marcum broke inside to search for possible victims and found an especially furry one

'I'm glad no one was inside': Buckland is a former firefighter and said his training immediately kicked in. He grabbed the cat and pulled it outside to safety

'The smokes lets out and as I can start to see I reach down and grab something furry!'

It was the cat, of course, but it was unresponsive.

Buckland took it outside and began rescue efforts.

'The cat comes around,' Buckland said. 'Takes a look at me, then hissed!'

Rescued! The cat was poorly responsive when they emerged from the fire, but Batman worked his magic and managed to coax the kitty back to life

Buckland said the cat hissed when it came to, but that's understandable. 'He got rescucitated by Batman,' he said. 'That's a pretty scary thing to wake up to.'

Buckland joked that the response was warranted.

'He got rescucitated by batman, that's a pretty scary thing to wake up to.'

The occupants of the home were out of town and only the cat was home at the time of the fire, a fact that made Buckland grateful.

But he was also left with questions, which comes as no surprise when the man in question counts Catwoman among his greatest frenemies.

'I just want to know what's going through that cat's mind,' he said. 'I'm just glad that nobody else was in that house.'
