Match of the Day anchor Gary Lineker is understood to have agreed a new deal to keep him at the BBC.

Like his Match of the Day colleague Alan Hansen, Lineker will have to take a significant drop in his current £2million-a-year contract due to both cost-cutting across the board and the fact that his last contract including his work on the BBC’s coverage of the London Olympic Games.

Staying put: Gary Lineker has signed a new contract to host Match of the Day alongside Alan Shearer, Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson

Any drop in salary will be cushioned by Lineker’s contracts with Arabic TV network Al Jazeera — for whom he presents the station's Champions League coverage — and his long-running deal with Walkers crisps.

It is understood a part of the new deal will involve him doing more Sunday Match of the Day programmes when the flagship fixtures are on that day.

American network NBC were interested in trying to poach Lineker but have landed ESPN’s Rebecca Lowe in his place, who will command a far smaller fee.
