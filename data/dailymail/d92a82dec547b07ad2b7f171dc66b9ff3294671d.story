A neglected 19th century farm house has been transformed into a wacky rainbow house, by an artist who saw the house as a blank canvas.

The farmhouse is located in the middle of the woods in High Falls, New York, and looks a fairy tale gingerbread house from the outside, hand painted in all the colors of the rainbow.

Inside, the quirky house is even brighter, with up-cycled furniture and chandeliers in each room, which clash boldly with the pink, green and purple walls.

Cosy hideaway: The farmhouse is located in the middle of the woods in High Falls, New York

The house, which is called Calico, is the handy work of artist Kat O' Sullivan.

She bought the neglected property in 2009 and together with her friends decorated the plain white farmhouse to suit her bright tastes.

Kat said: 'As things evolve, we feel more blessed that we get to call this funny place home.

'To me it was like a blank canvas. 

'The nice thing with having such an endless project is that, over time, you can incorporate an infinite amount of inspirations into it, and create your own unique voice.'

Magical: It looks a fairy tale gingerbread house, with all of the fixtures and fittings hand painted in all the colors of the rainbow

Quirky: Up-cycled furniture and chandeliers  appear in each room, which clash boldly with the pink, green and purple walls

The house which was built in 1840 was plain white with a rotting roof and lino floors when Kat bought it.

Now, she has injected new life into the house through colorful wall art, including hand painted eyes and a smiling mouth.

Kat, also known by her artist name as Katwise, creates colorful up-cycled patchwork jumpers for a living in her house and chronicles her crazy colourful life on at katwise.com.

Kat said: 'It has been quite a renovation journey to get the house to its psychedelic rainbow state and this is just the first coat. It will only get weirder.'
