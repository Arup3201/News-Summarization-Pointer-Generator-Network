Commuters faced chaotic scenes while getting to work in London this morning - with two-thirds of buses in London not running because of a strike.

Passengers had been warned that their journeys would be 'significantly disrupted' because of a walkout by thousands of members of the Unite union.

The strike came despite the fact that only 16 per cent of drivers in the capital voted for the industrial action over pay.

Some 24million journeys are made across the TfL network daily - and almost 90 per cent of adult fare paying passengers used public transport today.

The lack of buses meant that the Tube and train network in the capital had to cope with an estimated two million extra journeys today.

There were 2,156 congestion hotspots and 1,282 miles of tailbacks across the Greater London area at 8.30am today, according to TomTom Traffic.

The average total jam length during the peak hour in London is 501 miles. The worst congestion was on the A12 in Essex heading towards London.

On that stretch of road - which links the capital to Great Yarmouth in Norfolk - there was stationary traffic for 15 miles causing two hours of delays.

Around a third of buses ran during the morning rush and passengers were urged to check before they travelled.

There are around 46million bus journeys made in London on an average week, with some 6.5million bus journeys taken in the capital every day

And it was revealed in 2013 that the number of journeys by London bus had increased from 1.4billion to 2.3billion - 64 per cent - in the past 13 years.

Mike Weston, Transport for London's director of buses, said: 'I am very sorry that the leadership of Unite have chosen to disrupt the journeys of bus passengers, especially given that only 16 per cent of the bus drivers voted for strike action.

'As the bus companies who employ the drivers have said, it makes no sense to pay all drivers precisely the same amount.

'As in all professions, bus drivers have different skills and experience and it is only right that this can be reflected in pay.

'If all drivers are paid the average then, by definition, half of all bus drivers will need to take a pay cut.

'Any 'levelling up' of pay to the highest rates would lead to a cut in bus services, an increase in fares, or both.

'London has one of the best and most extensive bus networks anywhere in the world. 

'It would be much better if the leadership of Unite actually worked with the bus companies to ensure that it remains that way rather than disrupting bus passengers.'

Unite said there was a difference of around £3 an hour in pay rates in London bus companies. The union is campaigning for a single rate.

Unite reported solid support for the strike and said picket lines had been mounted outside bus depots across the capital.

Val Shawcross, Labour's transport spokesman on the London Assembly, said: 'Today's dispute is regrettable, but not surprising given the fact that London's bus operating companies treat drivers so unfairly.

Author Juanita Ingram said on Instagram from Old Street: 'Did everyone just decide to drive this morning in London because of the bus strike? Ugh. Two hours and I'm still not at my office. Gotta #LoveLondon.'

And a Twitter user named 'Juliette' said: 'In nearly two hours I made it to Hendon Central. Which is 1/6 of my total journey #BusStrike.'

Meanwhile fashion PR worker Erica Wenham, from west London, tweeted: 'My usual 30 minute journey to work has taken almost two hours today. #BusStrike #Annoyed.'

And mother Tracey Allen said: 'Not impressed - my daughters had to leave at 7am and walk to school - it's an hour's walk and walk home again later x #BusStrike.'

'The mayor has washed his hands of responsibility for London's bus drivers, but it is not just a matter of fairness that he should take some responsibility for resolving this dispute.

'London's passengers will get a better service from transport staff who are treated fairly.

'The mayor raises questions about the validity of strike ballots, but this strike had 84% of Unite members voting in support.

'London's bus drivers are not militant. In fact, this is only the second London-wide bus strike in 50 years.'

The assembly's Conservative transport spokesman Richard Tracey said: 'This sort of strike action, designed to bring London to a standstill, is archaic and belongs in the past.

'Withdrawing services will only hurt commuters and businesses.

'A better solution would be New York-style mediation from an independent judge between employees and their private companies.

'In this case, it's a fact of life that people doing similar jobs for different companies get different amounts of pay, so the call for standard wages across the board seems unrealistic.'

A petition has been started to allow licensed minicabs access to bus lanes during transport strikes.

Minicab comparison and booking app Kabbee said it will submit the petition to TfL.

Chief executive Justin Peters said: 'Today's bus strike will cause millions of Londoners problems getting to work, or any other destination, which will have a detrimental knock-on effect on commerce.

A former chief of naval staff has called for greater use of the Thames to ease congestion on London's roads and railways.

Labour ex-minister Lord West of Spithead said increased use of the river would 'take a lot of weight off the railway system and the roads'.

His comments came after passenger chaos due to over-running engineering works at King's Cross over the Christmas break and problems at London Bridge.

Transport minister Baroness Kramer agreed at question time the Thames offered 'exciting opportunities'.

But because it 'winds and bends around loops' journeys could be 'fairly slow'.

Independent crossbencher Lord Palmer said the 'fiasco' at London Bridge and the 'chaos' at Finsbury Park were good reasons to 'renationalise everything to do with our railways'.

Lady Kramer said quite a number of the problems that had occurred were down to Network Rail 'the one part of the system that we actually do directly own'.

She said the problems highlighted were 'inexcusable' and must be dealt with.

Liberal Democrat Lord Bradshaw said there had been 'tremendous under-investment' for decades in the rail network.

'It pinpoints the imperative of getting HS2 working ... to relieve the congestion,' he added.

Lady Kramer told him: 'I agree with everything you've just said.' But Labour spokesman Lord Davies of Oldham added, to laughter: 'Well, I don't.'

Lord Davies asked how frequently ministers met with Network Rail planners when 'crunch' works were approaching, adding: 'Ministers should realise the buck stops with them.'

Lady Kramer said there were frequent meetings. 'There are many lessons to be learned from the experiences of the last couple of weeks, which have been inexcusable.'

'A simple solution that would help keep London moving, is to grant access to London's licensed minicabs during public transport strikes, but it's a solution that TfL is just not willing to consider.'

Unite said around 20,000 of its members had joined the strike, with picket lines mounted at 70 bus depots across London.

A spokesman said: 'Rather than quoting misleading figures about turnouts in the ballots, TfL and the mayor need to look at the streets of London today and recognise the depth of anger felt by bus workers.

'They need to bang the bus companies' heads together and get them to allow collective bargaining.'
