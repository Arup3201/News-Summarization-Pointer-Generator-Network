I get around: Neanderthals interbred with all modern humans except those from sub-Saharan Africa, a new study suggests

Sub-Saharan Africans are the only modern humans whose ancestors apparently did not interbreed with Neanderthals, new research suggests.

Scientists studying human genetic ancestry have found that, like modern Eurasian peoples, modern North Africans also carry genetic traces which suggest some Neanderthal ancestry.

Neanderthals were a closely related species of humans who thrived in Europe and the near East during the last Ice Age but died out around 30,000 years ago.

Genetic evidence published in 2010 
suggests they interbred with the ancestors of some modern humans, with 
as much as 1 to 4 per cent of modern Eurasian genomes containing 
Neanderthal DNA.

According to one theory, this occurred
 between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago, shortly after the proto-Eurasians 
emerged from Africa, while they were still one population.

An alternative explanation suggests 
that was an ancestral group which gave rise to both Neanderthals and 
modern non-Africans which genetically split from other Africans about 
230,000 years ago and stayed separate until finally leaving Africa.

To determine which scenario is more 
likely scientists analysed North Africans, since some researchers have 
suggested were the source of the out-of-Africa migrations that led to 
humans spreading across the world.

The team led by Federico Sánchez-Quinto, a palaeontologist at Barcelona's Institute of Evolutionary Biology, analysed a total of 780,000 genetic variants in 125 people from seven North African locations.

They found that North African populations have a significant excess of genetic variants shared with the Neanderthal genome compared to sub-Saharan Africans - on a par to that found in non-African humans.

As expected, findings showed that those North African populations whose ancestors had the most interbreeding with modern Near Eastern of European humans also had a high amount of Neanderthal ancestry, and those whose ancestors bred with sub-Saharan Africans had a lower Neanderthal signal.

However, they also found certain North African populations with very little Eurasian ancestry - Tunisian Berbers and Saharawi - that also showed a strong Neanderthal signal, in some cases as high or higher than Eurasian populations.

African populations as a fraction of that found in Europeans: Relative

The researchers wrote in the 
open-access journal Plos One: 'Eurasian populations are the closest to 
Neandertals among modern humans, which is in agreement with previous 
studies.

'Sub-Saharan 
Africans are, as expected, more distant to Neandertal, whereas North 
African individuals are placed between these two groups. [...]

'It is interesting to notice that the 
North African populations closer to Neandertals are populations with a 
large known European or Near Eastern admixture, but also the Tunisians 
that have an almost complete autochthonous North African genetic 
component.'

The only genetically 'pure' humans: Sub-Saharan Africans are the only human population that do not show any traces of interbreeding with Neanderthals

The results suggested that the signal 
came directly from ancient mixing with Neanderthals and not with more 
recent interbreeding with modern humans who carried some Neanderthal 
genes.

Neanderthals learned how to make jewellery and sophisticated tools from the ancestors of modern humans, a study suggests.

New high precision radiocarbon dating shows that a cultural exchange may have taken place between modern humans and Neanderthals in France and Spain more than 40,000 years ago.

The findings have important implications for our understanding of our long-extinct sister species.

If Neanderthals made such ornaments, they must have been capable of symbolic behaviour thought to be unique to man.

However, the 
researchers do not believe that this mixing came from Neanderthals who 
entered North Africa and made contact with the population there.

'Given that the North African autochthonous ancestry seems to be 12,000–40,000 years old, our hypothesis is that this ancestral population was descendant from the populations that first interbreed with Neandertals about ~37,000–86,000 years ago somewhere in the Middle East,' they wrote.

They admit that with their current data they have not managed to completely dispense with the possibility that these Neanderthal traces may have come from some common ancestor to both humans and our extinct cousins.

However, they say their findings as well as those of previous studies 'tend to favor the admixture hypothesis as the most plausible one.'

'In any case,' they conclude, 'our results show that Neandertal genomic traces do not mark a division between African and non-Africans but rather a division between Sub-Saharan Africans and the rest of modern human groups, including those from North Africa.'
