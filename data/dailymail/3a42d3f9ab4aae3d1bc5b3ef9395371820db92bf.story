Stand by for 360 minutes of festive football action which could define the season. Title-chasers Chelsea and Manchester City will be wanting to put more distance between themselves and the pack while Manchester United continue to snap away at their heels.

Arsenal have some ground to make up and there is also the intriguing question of whether West Ham and Southampton can sustain their surprise challenge. Christmas tends to sort out the men from the boys, after all.

Four games, 13 days. While the nation sits on its collective backside, gorging, can the Barclays Premier League provide a feast of another kind? Here are Sportsmail’s predictions - eat your heart out Mystic Meg.

APPETISERS: Saturday, December 20 - Monday December 22

Saturday December 20 

Manchester City vs Crystal Palace (12.45pm kick-off, BT Sport 1)

Sunday December 21

Newcastle United vs Sunderland (1.30pm kick-off, Sky Sports 1)

Liverpool vs Arsenal (4pm kick-off, SS1)

Monday December 22

Stoke City vs Chelsea (8pm kick-off, SS1)

It is the weekend before Christmas and legs will still be relatively fresh. Manchester City arguably have the ‘easiest’ matches - Crystal Palace, West Bromwich Albion, Burnley and Sunderland - but they must first overcome the challenge of having no fit striker.

The round of games kick off with City vs Palace on Saturday lunchtime. Sergio Aguero and his 14 goals will be missing, as will fellow forwards Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic. Maybe Frank Lampard could do a job there, after all he has scored goals already.

Palace, two successive draws behind them, will be relying on the wizardry of Yannick Bolasie before he departs on Africa Cup of Nations duty, but it is hard to see anything but a City win.

Saturday afternoon looms in importance for Southampton, who have lost five matches in a row, including the Capital One Cup quarter-final against League One Sheffield United.

Ronald Koeman’s team last won at the start of November (2-0 against Leicester City) and next up are Everton, whose form has been flaky.

West Ham have been ticking along very nicely recently with three wins and a draw while Leicester have to go back to September for their last victory. Nigel Pearson’s team will do well to come away with anything, especially if Diafra Sakho is in the mood, not to mention Andy Carroll.

Then there is Manchester United, who boast an extraordinary record against Aston Villa.

The last time Villa beat United at home in the league was the opening day of the 1995-96 season.

In the last five matches against Louis van Gaal’s team, Villa have conceded 17 goals. Expect them to put up the shutters, batten down the hatches and double-bolt the front door, which could be a tester for in-form skipper Wayne Rooney.

Arsenal, pilloried a fortnight ago after losing at Stoke City, go to old foes Liverpool. Revenge will be on Arsene Wenger’s mind after last season’s 5-1 thrashing at Anfield and two successive four-goal hauls (Galatasaray and Newcastle United) will fuel optimism. Olivier Giroud’s double against Newcastle suggests he is getting better every game, too.

And finally Chelsea, who head to the Britannia Stadium on Monday night.

Jose Mourinho’s team will be up for a cold night in the Potteries and they will be trying to forget last year’s 3-2 shock defeat. Stoke have conceded 10 goals at home in five games - Diego Costa and Eden Hazard could have a field day.

Turkey and all the trimmings: Boxing Day (Friday December 26)

Boxing Day (Friday December 26) 

Chelsea vs West Ham United (12.45pm kick-off, Sky Sports 1)

Manchester United vs Newcastle United (3.00pm kick-off, BT Sport 1)

Arsenal vs Queens Park Rangers (5.30pm kick-off, BT Sport 1) 

The perfect way to recover from the gluttony of Christmas Day - a London derby between Chelsea and West Ham at lunchtime on Boxing Day. This is the time of year when injuries and rotation play an important part and Mourinho could well make the point his players have had 48 hours less to recover than the Hammers.

West Ham drew 0-0 at Stamford Bridge last season but have not scored there in their previous three Premier League visits.

Koeman gets his first taste of no-winter-break action when he takes Southampton to Palace. He will have the next fixtures against Chelsea and Arsenal in the back of his mind so will that mean resting players? Probably not, having lost to Burnley last week. He needs points and goals from Graziano Pelle (one in eight games). Palace will hope to have Marouane Chamakh fit again.

Manchester United are at home to Newcastle where Rooney, seven-goal Robin van Persie and five-goal Juan Mata may expect to make the most out of Alan Pardew’s goalkeeper worries. United fans will remember too well that they lost this fixture 1-0 last season.

Relegation-fighting West Brom face Manchester City and will regard a point as a massive achievement, especially if they beat Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. Expect Pellegrini to rotate and to win. QPR, meanwhile, have the job of putting a spoke in Arsenal’s wheel in the late afternoon kick-off.

Robin van Persie has netted seven goals this season and will look to add to that  against Newcastle United

Alan Pardew is facing a goalkeeper crisis and will have to continue to play 21-year-old Jak Alnwick

Chelsea 1-0 West Ham United

Crystal Palace 0-0 Southampton

Manchester United 3-1 Newcastle United

West Bromwich Albion 1-3 Manchester City

Arsenal 2-1 Queens Park Rangers

Christmas leftovers: Sunday December 28-Monday 29

Sunday December 28

Tottenham Hotspur vs Manchester United (12.00pm kick-off, BT Sport 1)

Southampton vs Chelsea (2.05pm kick-off, Sky Sports 1)

Newcastle United vs Everton (4.15pm kick-off, Sky Sports 1) 

Monday December 29

Liverpool vs Swansea City (8.00pm kick-off, Sky Sports 1)

Barely 48 hours after turning out on Boxing Day, weary bodies will need to be dragged out of bed for another round of matches. With fatigue settling in, mistakes are more likely, not to mention injuries.

Midday kick-off sees LVG take United to White Hart Lane. Working on the basis that Tottenham Hotspur will have gained a few points from the fixtures against Burnley and Leicester, Mauricio Pochettino’s side could easily have built up a head of steam for this one.More importantly for stats watchers, Spurs have not lost to United in their last four Premier League meetings.

Chelsea head to the south coast where Southampton currently hold the record of joint meanest defence in the Premier League with, er, Chelsea.

Can Nacer Chadli and Tottenham Hotspur beat Man United at White Hart Lane over Christmas? 

Chelsea's defence, including captain John Terry, is the joint-meanest in the league alongside Southampton

Both have conceded just 13 so far, which would suggest a goalless draw, except that the Saints’ recent poor run has included losing to Man United, City and Arsenal.

City take on the ginger Mourinho - Sean Dyche - and Burnley will be up for this one. Whether or not Danny Ings will get a look-in is another matter entirely.

Then there is another London derby with the Hammers hosting Arsenal. On paper this could be a cracker.

Alexis Sanchez could be the star attraction in the mouthwatering clash between Arsenal and West Ham

West Ham United 2-2 Arsenal 

Champagne time: New Year's Day (Thursday January 1)

New Year's Day (Thursday January 1)

Stoke City vs Manchester United (12.45pm kick-off, Sky Sports 1)

Manchester City vs Sunderland (3.00pm kick-off, BT Sport 1)

Tottenham Hotspur vs Chelsea (5.30pm kick-off, BT Sport 1)

Clear heads will be the order of the day on what is another annual quirk of the match list. Just a month after these teams met, it is time for the reverse fixture, which means grudges can still be held and revenge may be a motivating factor.

Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata scored the goals for Man United in their 2-1 win at Old Trafford at the start of December but Stoke have a habit of rising to the occasion at the Britannia.

This will be a tricky lunchtime match on New Year’s Day.

Juan Mata has already netted against Stoke this season and he will look to do so again

Bojan and the rest of the Potters side will host Man United confident they can get a result, though

The same could be said for Chelsea, who will hope to feed off the recent 3-0 win against Tottenham. Goals from Eden Hazard, Didier Drogba and Loic Remy made it miserable for Spurs and could make it miserable again for them in the tea-time kick-off.

Koeman felt robbed at the last-minute Alexis Sanchez winner which gave Arsenal victory over Southampton at the Emirates but it is another mammoth ask for his players after the Chelsea game on December 28. Unfinished business might be the order of the day for West Brom too, as they travel to Upton Park.

West Ham won 2-1 at The Hawthorns at the start of the month, thanks to goals from Kevin Nolan and James Tomkins. It was a match where Albion bossed possession but showed their lack of a cutting edge. Expectations could be the Hammers’ undoing.
