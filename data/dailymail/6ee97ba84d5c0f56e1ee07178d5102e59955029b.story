Staring into the camera, the girl's striking blue eyes are full of unshed tears. And she isn't alone. The girl in the polka dot headscarf and her family are just some of the thousands of people who have crossed the border into Iraq in a bid to escape the slaughter in Syria.

Although the raging civil war has cost her family their home, the girl is luckier than most. An ethnic Kurd, she has managed to escape the fighting that has taken the lives of thousands of her compatriots as well as the bouts of ethnic violence that have taken the lives of Kurds in Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran over the last century.

Now she and other Kurdish refugees are the subject of a series of stunning photographs by French snapper Eric Lafforgue who travelled to Iraq last month to meet them.

Refugee: This girl, a Syrian Kurd, was forced to flee with her family to a refugee camp in the Iraqi Kurdish city of Erbil after her home was bombed

Pitiless: The raging conflict in Syria has spared no one, young or old, and as a result, vast numbers have been forced to make the perilous journey into Iraq

'We know the Kurdish people well because they suffered a 
lot under the Saddam Hussein regime,' he explains. 'They were killed with chemical weapons in Halabja.'

Since the fall of the dictator, Iraq has become a safer place for Kurds thanks to the creation of a Kurdish statelet within the country where many of those fleeing violence in Syria have taken shelter.

'Nowadays, many Kurdish Syrian refugees have found shelter in Kurdistan,' adds Lafforgue. 'It was interesting to meet people who have led such a difficult life and who are trying to build a new nation.

'The girl in the polka dot scarf lives in a refugee camp in Erbil [in Iraqi Kurdistan] and had to leave her village [in Syria] two months ago after it was bombed. They have nothing, just the help of the other Kurds.'

Haunted:
 This young boy's face bears traces of his recent ordeal. His blond hair
 and green eyes are thought to be the result of Russians who married 
Kurdish women

Pretty: This little girl is now safe in Kurdistan but it wasn't always the case - Iraqi Kurds became victims of Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons in 1988

Tough times: For this boy and his family, the onset of winter is something to be dreaded thanks to the precarious nature of life in the refugee camps

And life in the refugee camp is far from easy. 'Winter will come with the rains, and everybody fears the worst,' explains Lafforgue. 'Her beauty hides a cruel reality.'

Despite their difficult circumstances, Lafforgue reveals that not only were the refugees happy to let him photograph them, they proved generous and welcoming hosts.

'They all welcomed me as a friend and offered me food and drink, even when they had nothing for them,' he remembers.

Other portraits in the series include that of an older woman, in a vibrant cerulean headscarf, and a little blond boy whose face still bears traces of a recent ordeal.

Most striking of all is the fact that nearly all have stunning blue eyes - unusual among Middle Eastern peoples for whom liquid dark brown is the norm.

'They are not Arab,' explains Lafforgue. 'They do not want you to call them Arabs.They are Kurdish and it is different. Their
 story is a mix of migration and invasion.

'Many say that Russians came during the last century and felt in love with Kurdish women, which is where the blue eyes are thought to come from.'

 smiles: Despite their precarious existence, photographer Eric Lafforgue
 says the Kurdish refugees were wonderfully kind and welcoming

Cruel reality: The story of the Kurdish people 
is one of invasion and migration with the majority of Kurds now split 
between Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria

The 30 million strong population of ethnic Kurds originated in Iran and now live mainly in Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria, although a significant diaspora is also to be found in Armenia, Georgia, Israel, Azerbaijan, Russia and Lebanon.

An ancient people, the first mention of the Kurds came in 3000 BC, when a Sumerian tablet spoke of the land of 'Kar-da' and referred to the 'Kur' [mountain] people.

There are also numerous legends associated with the origins of the Kurds, including one which claims they are the descendants of King Solomonâ€™s angelic servants or Djinn, who were sent to Europe to find 500 beautiful maidens for the king's harem.

But by the time the Djinn returned, the king had died and the servants settled in the mountains, married the women themselves and founded the Kurdish people.

By the early mediaeval period, the Kurdish clans ruled mini-kingdoms across the Middle East before coming under the rule of the Ottoman sultans of Istanbul.

Although the Kurds had lived peacefully for much of the Ottoman period, the 19th century brought the birth of the Kurdish nationalist movement which first reared its head as a political entity in 1880 under Sheik Ubeydullah.

The uprising was suppressed but nationalism was not forgotten. In the years after the World Wars and the end of the Ottoman Empire, repeated rebellions in Turkish Kurdistan led to the imposition of martial law while in Iraq, Kurdish nationalism was met with the tanks and bombs of the ruling Ba'ath party.

By the 1970s, the PKK or Kurdish Worker's Party, had become entrenched in eastern Turkey, fighting running battles with Turkish armed forces and considered a terrorist organisation by the UN and many Western nations.

But it was in 1980s Iraq where the Kurds would meet their deadliest enemy - the chemical weapons of Saddam Hussein which killed more than 5,000 people in a 1988 attack on the town of Hallabja.

Today, the Kurds are still spread far and wide but the peace process in Turkey is beginning to improve the lot of those living between the Turkish army and the PKK.

In Iraq meanwhile, the autonomous region of Kurdistan in the north has provided a haven for local Iraqi Kurds and those fleeing from the conflict in neighbouring Syria.
