When a husband and wife firefighting team were called to an Illinois trailer park to tackle a fire, they already knew the address - it was their own home.

Crystal and Clinton Henderson were part of a Horseshoe Lake Fire Service team that fought in vain to control the fire that left their family trailer gutted.

But despite all of their belongings having been destroyed by the fire, the pair, who live with Clinton's mother and their four children, are just glad that no one was home at the time.

Crystal Henderson told of her relief that her family were all out when the blaze started

Mrs Henderson told KFVS12: 'The children are not too happy, they're upset that their toys, their clothes and everything are gone.

'But my kids, my mother-in-law and husband we're all fine. Emotionally we're not but physically we're fine.'

Among the family's destroyed belongings were Christmas presents for the Henderson children.

The fire, which completely destroyed the family's Olive Branch home, is though to have started in a bedroom that was shared by Mr Henderson's mother and one of the couple's children.

Investigators are currently unsure how the fire started but are not treating it as suspicious.

As well as Mr and Mrs Henderson, the fire was of great concern for Horseshoe Lake's fire chief Joshua McKee, who is Mr Henderson's nephew.

He told of his shock at arriving at the Henderson's home but added that the team had to remain professional despite their own personal attachments.

He said: 'That's part of our job.

'We get here and we do our job like we are supposed.'
