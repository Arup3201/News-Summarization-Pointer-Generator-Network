German chancellor Angela Merkel has a reputation as a tough politician, but she evidently has a softer side.

Staying at her regular Easter holiday hotel on the south Italian island of Ischia, she noticed that an employee she had known for years was missing.

When she found that Cristoforo Iacono has been laid off, she slipped out of the five-star Hotel Miramare and visited him and his family at home.

His daughter Marianna said Chanellor Merkel had lunch with the family, adding the visit was a 'pleasure'

Details of the visit were revealed by his daughter Marianna who said: 'Chancellor Merkel hadnâ€™t seen my father in the hotel where she is staying and when she learned he had lost his job she came to see him at home.

'She came in, sat down and had lunch with us.

'She has known him for years, even before she became leader of the German government . It was a pleasure to have her here in our home.'

Her visit was praised by mayor 
Rosario Caruso who said: 'It was a beautiful gesture, demonstrating an 
attention to human nature and shows how particularly sensitive she is.'

She has been pictured enjoying the 
facilities of the open air pool, dressed in a swimming costume and flip 
flops with her husband Joachim Sauer and they are due to leave later 
this week.

Ahead of her arrival Stefano Caldoro,
president of the Campania region where she is on holiday, issued a 
video message to her in which he asked her to take stock of the current 
situation gripping the European Union.

It was titled 'Wecome Chancellor Merkel to our hospitable land but now look around you.'

In the video he said: 'Thank you once again for picking the Campania region once again for your holiday but while here we ask you to reflect on the relationship with the European Union.

'This crisis is hitting businesses, they are closing down, with evermore serious repercussions.

'We are on the edge of social breakdown. We cannot allow a two tier Europe, nor can we allow an anti German feeling.'

He also pointed out that in his region there are 10 Italians unemployed for every German.
