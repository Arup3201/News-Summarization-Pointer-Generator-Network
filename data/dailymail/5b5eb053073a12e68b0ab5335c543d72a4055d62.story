A 15-year-old boy fatally stabbed a 52-year-old man in the heart after he accidentally spilled coffee on the teenager while leaving a McDonald's, according to authorities.

The teen, who has not been named because he is a juvenile, and 22-year-old James McLamb have been charged in the death. Police are seeking a third suspect but say they know his identity.

The group was near a McDonald's in Stamford, Connecticut last Wednesday when Antonio Muralles left the fast-food restaurant with a cup of coffee and accidentally bumped into the boy.

'Words were exchanged and then without warning, he was viciously attacked and stabbed through the heart - a very heinous, tragic incident,' Captain Richard Conklin told the Stamford Advocate.

Accused: James McLamb, 22, has been charged in the death of a 52-year-old man who was stabbed to death in Stamford, Connecticut last week. McLamb's 15-year-old friend allegedly carried out the stabbing

Police said Muralles was also slapped and beaten with a stick.

Lieutenant Deidrich Hohn said that the juvenile was responsible for the stabbing, while McLamb assaulted the man,Fox CT reported.

Muralles collapsed on a street corner around 10.15pm and was seen by emergency responders who happened to be passing. He was rushed to hospital but died several hours later.

Police said information from a narcotics officer's informant helped them hone in on the attackers.

With that information, they looked through hundreds of hours of video surveillance tape from different downtown cameras and were able to place them in the area of the stabbing.

Police then received a call from a witness - which they said is rare - and she was able to provide them further information that ultimately led to the arrests.

Police are still seeking a third suspect in the crime. 

McLamb was arrested on an unrelated weapons charge on Saturday and was transferred to Stamford on Monday to be arraigned. He is being held in lieu of $2 million bond.

McLamb didn't enter a plea. His public defender says he hasn't yet read McLamb's arrest warrant for the murder charge.

Records show he has minor offenses on his rap sheet, including disorderly conduct, violation of probation, sixth-degree larceny and failure to appear at court, the Advocate reported. 

The 15-year-old boy was arrested at a home and his arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday. Authorities have said there is a possibility he will be charged as an adult, Fox reported.

Relatives and friends have paid tribute to Muralles as a quiet, hard-working man who was employed at a factory. His colleagues were devastated when they heard the news of his death.

'They all started bawling, it was terrible,' co-worker Matthew Deedon told Fox CT. 'He was like a son to the owner. He was my best friend. He was family - that's the best way to put it.'

Family members said Muralles, who lived with his niece and her husband, had hoped to move back to his native Guatemala one day to care for his ailing 92-year-old father.

His remains are being flown back to the country after the Guatemalan government offered to cover the cost.

His death is the city's first homicide in 2015.
