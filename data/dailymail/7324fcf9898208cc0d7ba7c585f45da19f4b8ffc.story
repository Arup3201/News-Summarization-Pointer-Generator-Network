Liverpool fans may be lamenting the loss of Luis Suarez, but Liverpool's players were in good spirits as they let loose on tour in New York.

Brendan Rodgers' men can be seen out at a bar in New York, relaxing before they have to head back to England and the real work begins.

There were some noticeable absentees. Raheem Sterling and a number of others were missing, presumably because they are not yet 21 and so cannot drink in America.

That did not seem to stop 20-year-old Jack Robinson, though, who can be seen in the centre.

Steven Gerrard posted the picture on his Instagram account accompanied by the words: 'Can't beat a bit of team bonding and what a great city to do it #NYC #LFC.'

Liverpool are currently on tour in the US where they are taking part in the International Champions Cup - a friendly competition that also includes Roma, Olympiacos, Inter, AC Milan, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Manchester United.

Liverpool played Manchester City last night - eventually wining on penalties after a 2-2 draw.

Stevan Jovetic twice put Manchester City in front but goals from Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling took the game to penalties and Liverpool held their nerve to hang on to their 100 per cent record in the competition.

Bonding: The picture included a significant proportion of the Liverpool squad

Home comforts: Luacs, and Philippe Coutinho head to a Brazilian steakhouse with Skrtel and Coates
