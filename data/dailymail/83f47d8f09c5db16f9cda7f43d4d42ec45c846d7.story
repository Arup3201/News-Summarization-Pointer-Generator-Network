Clinton Onyeahialam, 19, was charged with two counts of sexual assault of a child

A 19-year-old has been arrested in the alleged rape of a 16-year-old girl who was attacked and then had pictures of her naked body posted to social media.

Clinton Onyeahialam, 19, was charged with two counts of sexual assault of a child 

According to court documents, Onyeahialam attacked two teen girls on June 1 in Texas, reports Click 2 Houston.

After photos spread of the girl, only identified as Jada, sick internet trolls mimicked the girl by taking photos copying the position of her limp body and posting them to Twitter and Vine using the hashtag '#jadapose'.

Many of the images have since been removed - and other internet users have slammed their sick taunts and have jumped to her defense.

Speaking of the arrest to NBC today, Jada said the news was 'wonderful' and she would like to now see 'justice in full effect.'  

'My life has changed a lot. It is not the same anymore, but it's not the worst. 

'From my community there is very little support still such as the teenagers, but as adults they are very supportive and people outside my community are very supportive.' 

In July the teen bravely stepped forward and spoke out about the alleged attack in an interview with KHOU.

'There's no point in hiding,' she said 
in the interview. 'Everybody has already seen my face and my body, but 
that's not what I am and who I am.'

Speaking of the arrest to NBC, the alleged victim Jada (pictured with her spokesman) said the news was 'wonderful' and she would like to now see 'justice in full effect'

In July the teen bravely stepped forward and spoke out about the alleged attack in an interview with KHOU 

Jada told the station that she had attended a party with a friend, and thought it was just going to be kids hanging out.

But when she showed up, the teen boy hosting the party gave her a drink of punch she believes was spiked with some sort of drug.

Jada
 says she passed out and didn't know what happened for the rest of the 
night until after the party, when pictures of her body - stripped from 
the waist down - started appearing on social media.

She said she only found out she was raped when she saw the pictures.

Following the attack, Jada's peers mercilessly continued to spread the 
videos and pictures online - and since her interview, trolls also started attacking her. 

Jada fought back against the internet bullies by posing with the hashtag 'I am Jada'

Cruel: In another, three boys reenact the pose that the victim was photographed making after the attack

Sick: After the images were put online, others copied her limp pose with the hashtag '#jadapose'

As the hashtag spread, other internet users decided to claim it as their own to throw support behind the teenage victim and lambast her attackers. 

'Houston 
loves and supports you, Jada,' Kia Hutch wrote on Twitter. 'Standing in 
solidarity #JusticeforJada #jadacounterpose #jadapose.'

Jada fought back against the internet bullies by posing with the hashtag 'I am Jada' which soon gained momentum.  

Onyeahialam's bond was set at $30,000.
