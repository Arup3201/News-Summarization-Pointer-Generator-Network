Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League.

1. Manchester City aren’t afraid to leave a foot in during big games – no side this weekend committed more fouls than the 15 that City were penalised for in the Manchester derby.

This season Manuel Pellegrini’s team have given away 16 fouls against Chelsea and 15 at Arsenal – but only six each in the matches when they were cruising to victory against Aston Villa and Hull.

2. Local lad Ryan Mason is emerging as Tottenham’s key midfield man ahead of players who cost the club millions.

The 23-year-old, who made his Spurs debut six years ago but then seemed to spend his life on loan, has started the last five Premier League games and was a big influence in the win at Aston Villa.

His part in Christian Benteke’s dismissal grabbed the headlines, but on the ball he was excellent – across the Premier League weekend only Yaya Toure, Cesc Fabregas and Ross Barkley played more accurate attacking passes than his 45.

3. West Ham’s work rate, so terrific beating Manchester City, dropped as they went two goals down at Stoke before a Stewart Downing inspired recovery earned a point.

Sam Allardyce had talked about the need to maintain the competitive attitude, but the message obviously didn’t entirely get through.

When Big Sam checks his stats he’ll find his team ran a collective two miles less at the Britannia Stadium than they managed at Upton Park a week earlier – and the number of sprints dropped by 6.4 per cent from 533 to 499.

4. Ronald Koeman is making a nonsense of the modern theory that players can’t perform at high intensity in two games a week.

The Southampton boss made just two changes at Hull from the side that had won 3-2 at Stoke in the Capital One Cup.

He also kept nine of his starting line-up to beat QPR after winning at Arsenal in the last round of the competition, and picked eight of the players who knocked Millwall out in round one for the 3-1 win at West Ham a few days later.

5. Dejan Lovren was supposed to be the hard man who would beef up Liverpool’s defence but so far has failed to make the big difference Brendan Rodgers was hoping for.

After losing at Newcastle the Reds have conceded two more goals than they did in the first ten games last season.

Match of the Day highlighted how 25-year-old Croatian international Lovren pulled out of a crucial 50-50 challenge late in the game. He won only two tackles in the 90 minutes, and this season has come out on top in just 72 per cent of his tackles, compared to 82.6 per cent when he was at Southampton last season.

6. Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton played for England at every age group from Under 16 to Under 21 during his days as a Manchester United player.

Now aged 28, playing behind a team that’s getting battered in the Premier League is giving him a chance to remind everybody of the potential he once showed.

Heaton made eight saves at Arsenal – more than any other keeper during Saturday’s games – although he still found himself picking the ball out of the net three times.

7. Blackburn’s Corry Evans, the younger brother of Manchester United defender Jonny, is starting to have a severe problem with his discipline.

The 24-year-old Northern Ireland international midfielder picked up his SEVENTH booking of the season in the 3-1 win over Reading.

That’s already three more yellow cards than he was shown in the whole of last season.

8. Sheffield Wednesday manager Stuart Gray needs to do something to stop his team throwing away points in games they have been leading.

The Owls dominated at Charlton with former Everton star Royston Drenthe starring but conceded an equaliser with 20 minutes left.

It’s the fourth time they’ve failed to see out a game from a winning position this season – and the eight points lost would have been enough to put Gray’s side second in the table.

9. Most managers like to pick one goalkeeper and stick with him, but Yeovil’s Gary Johnson turned to his FOURTH of the season to fight for the 0-0 draw at Chesterfield which gave him hope of getting out of the League One relegation zone.

Jed Steer’s arrival on loan from Aston Villa – together with the influence of 20-year-old Fulham defender Stephen Arthurworrey – kept the division’s top scorer Eoin Doyle at bay.

Johnson, 59 and a legend at Huish after leading the club into the Football League in his first spell in charge, and then to the Championship in his second, had previously used and discarded Chris Weale, Jake Kean and Artur Krysiak.

10. Portsmouth manager Andy Awford could do with bottling some of the spirit his side show at Fratton Park and taking it with him on the road.

The 3-0 romp over Carlisle in front of more than 15,000 fans put his side two points off the play-off places and means they have lost only once in front of their home crowd this season.

But that’s in stark contrast to the away record – since winning at Oxford at the end of August they have picked up just two points on their travels from six matches.
