On the fifth day of Christmas did your true love give you five gold rings? Or did he give you a Paisley print dress costing £8? That depends where he was shopping.

Online retailer iKrush are having an extravagant 12 days of Christmas-themed sale, a 12-day event during which they will sell 12 items costing from £1 to £12.

So you'll be able to get your hands on a pair of fur-trimmed boots for £12, a winter army jacket for £11, a studded bowling bag for £10... all the way down to a leatherette bodycon dress costging a measly £1.

It's the sort of sale about which even Ebenezer Scrooge would struggle to be grinchy.

The products are available at the special sale price for just one specific day. But would you buy any of them?
