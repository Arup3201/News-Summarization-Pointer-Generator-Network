Linford Christie has revealed his torment at perceived police racism when he was at the height of his athletics career.

Christie, 54, is the subject of an ITV4 documentary on Tuesday, which offers a rare insight into the psyche of one of Britain’s greatest but most controversial sportsmen.

He recalls two alleged racist incidents, the first shortly after he won a gold medal at the European Indoor Championships in 1986.

Linford Christie, now an athletics coach, has spoken of allegedly racist treatment at the hands of policeman

‘I remember when I got my Great Britain tracksuit, I was so proud,’ he said. ‘I walked along Shepherd’s Bush, this policeman started saying, “What’s a n***** like you doing in a British tracksuit?” 

'I went into a chip shop and came out of the shop, and he jumped me, twisted my arm behind my back, and arrested me. The next day they dropped all charges. It was just so stupid.’

Another time, he said, police refused to believe he was the owner of a sponsored car and arrested him.

Christie claims to have been arrested by a 'racist' policeman after winning the European Indoors in 1986

‘A couple of days later the police dropped a letter which said, “You don’t need to come back any more, we’ve made our enquiries”.

‘I said, “I still want an apology”, and they totally refused.’ Christie threatened court proceedings and the police eventually apologised. 

The sprinter, who tested positive for banned steroid nandrolone in 1999, is now an athletics coach.
