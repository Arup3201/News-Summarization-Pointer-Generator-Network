Commuters in China saved the life of a man who had fallen onto the tracks in the path of an approaching train by frantically signalling the driver who pulled up in the nick of time.

The dramatic rescue comes just a week after a New York resident was shoved onto the tracks and filmed by fellow passengers struggling to get back onto the platform before being hit and killed by a train.

Reports of 58-year-old Ki-Suck Han's  horrifying death, including the use of a picture - taken seconds before he was hit - on the front page of a popular New York newspaper, sparked a sharp outcry.

Seconds from death: Commuters managed to save the life of this Chinese rail passenger who fell onto the tracks in at a metro station in Beijing

Some people were shocked that no one had gone to 
help Mr Han while others dubbed the coverage 'gratuitous, not news' and 
'sickening rubber-necking'.

In the latest incident at Beijing's Sihui
Metro Station it was reported that the 
man fell onto the tracks just as the train started to pull onto the 
platform, meaning there would have only been a small amount of time for 
his fellow passengers to warn the driver.

In the New York incident, Mr Han reportedly stood on the 
tracks for 22 seconds as he tried in vain to get back up onto the platform before being hit. The comparative speeds of the two trains have not yet been released.

Commuters frantically signalled the driver who managed to pull up in time. The power was then cut and the man hauled back onto the platform

The injured passenger was given first aid at the scene but refused to go to hospital because he could not afford the cost

Witnesses in Beijing told how the man began swaying, closed his eyes and
collapsed head first onto the tracks.

Hundreds of passengers who were waiting 
for the train to arrive signalled frantically to the driver who managed 
to pull up just in time.

The power was then cut and the man was pulled up from the tracks and came to senses.

Controversial: The New York Post cover which showed the final moments of the rail passenger's life

Staff
administered first aid and called an ambulance, but the man insisted on
leaving before it arrived claiming he couldn't afford to go to 
hospital.

The New York incident at 49th Street station was 
captured by freelance photographer R. Umar Abbasi, who said he rapidly shot dozens of frames so
that his flash might alert the motorman and that he himself was too far
away to help.

One of his photographs appeared on the 
cover of the New York Post showing the final moments of Han's life as he
tried to scramble back onto the platform.

Abbasi's photographs have provoked a furious reaction with many claiming he, and 
other passengers, should have made more of an effort to help rescue Mr 
Han.

Others
have questioned whether trains arriving at Subway station should slow 
down to give the driver a chance to stop should they need to.

Mr Han was seen seen trying to clamber back onto the platform as the train approaches but no one on the platform tried to assist him.

The incident has led to much soul searching in New York and has raised questions about why nobody rushed to the victim's aid.
