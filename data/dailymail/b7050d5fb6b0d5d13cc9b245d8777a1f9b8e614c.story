A plane flying to Aberdeen was forced to turn back to Frankfurt after one of its engines failed mid-air.

Emergency: The Lufthansa plane's engine failed mid-air with 89 passengers on board

Myles Edwards, 25, who was on board the aeroplane that left Frankfurt on May 25 at 3.50pm, told the Evening Express: 'Gasps were heard from people who understood the message before it was read out in English confirming the engine problems.'

Passengers were seen in tears as the flight landed safely at the German airport, according to the paper.

A Lufthansa spokesman said the crew were able to restart the engine of the Boeing 737-500 immediately.

He added: 'Flight LH972 from Frankfurt to Aberdeen on Sunday diverted back to Frankfurt when engine number two inadvertently shut down in the vicinity of Amsterdam.

'The crew were able to restart the engine almost immediately but decided to return to Frankfurt to enable maintenance staff to investigate the cause.

'The crew operated the standard, well-rehearsed procedures for such an incident and the safety of the passengers and crew was not compromised.

'As a result this flight and the return LH973 from Aberdeen to Frankfurt were cancelled. 

'There were 89 passengers on the flight and a larger Boeing 737-300 aircraft operated the later flight from Frankfurt to  Aberdeen and the early flight from Aberdeen to Frankfurt on Monday morning to accommodate them and the 74 passengers originally booked on LH973.'

A later flight carried 74 of the passengers to Aberdeen on Monday.
