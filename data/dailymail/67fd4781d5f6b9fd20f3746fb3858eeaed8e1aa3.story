A haunting image of a Vietnamese girl in a windstorm, a breathtaking starscape over Kazakhstan and an explosion of colour as men partake in a fire dragon dance in China are all contenders for a major photography award.

The World Photography Organisation has today revealed the winners of the 2013 Sony World Photography Awards, with amateur photographers hailing from countries as far apart as Chile and Vietnam.

The judges have whittled down nearly 55,000 entries in the Open category to just 10, who will now will now compete for the Sony World Photography Awards Open Photographer of the Year title.

Inferno: The fire dragon dance is a 300-year-old event held in the Fung Shun area of southern China.  The dragons are composed of bamboo, metal wire and paper and are festooned with fireworks, firecrackers and fire arrows. Photographer Gilbert Yu was  forced to wear a protective mask and helmet to prevent fire burns

All category winners will also have their images exhibited at Somerset House, London, from 26 April – 12 May as part of an Exhibition and be published in a book.

Damien Demolder, presiding chair of jury for the Open competition and editor of Amateur Photographer magazine, said: 'Amateurs constantly amaze me, not only with their determination, their passion and their internal drive, but also with the astonishing quality they are capable of achieving.

'They can be extraordinarily creative, and more than capable of working to their own brief to turn a wonderful idea or moment into a beautiful photograph. In so many ways there are heftier chunks of real life and soul in amateur images than there are in the professional categories – because amateurs do it for the love of taking pictures.

'And the shortlist and winners for this year's Open competition demonstrates that perfectly.'

Sony also announced the three finalists in the Youth category, Alecsandra Dragoi, from Romania, Xu Wei Shou, from Taiwan and Berta Vicent, of Spain, as well as the winner of the 3D category, Slovenian photographer Matjaž Tančič.

Professional category winners and the coveted L’Iris D’Or/ Sony World Photography Awards Professional Photographer of the Year title will be announced at the ceremony in April.  The L’Iris D’Or winner will receive nearly £17,000.
