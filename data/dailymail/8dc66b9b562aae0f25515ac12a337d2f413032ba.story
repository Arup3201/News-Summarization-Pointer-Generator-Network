Defending champions Sevilla have one foot in the Europa league quarter-finals after they scored three away goals against La Liga rivals Villarreal in their round of 16 tie on Thursday night.

Vitolo opened the scoring for the visitors after just 13 seconds - the fastest goal in Europa League history - before former QPR midfielder Stephane M'bia doubled the advantage to hand Sevilla a commanding first-half lead at El Madrigal.

In-form Villarreal forward Luciano Vietto pulled a goal back for the home side just minutes after the restart but Sevilla's two-goal advantage was almost instantly restored through Kevin Gameiro.

Villarreal had only lost once in their last 14 matches at home in all competitions but Marcelino's side got off to the worst possible start.

With the very first attack of the game former PSG striker Gameiro flicked on a hopeful ball forward into the path of the breaking Vitolo who coolly slotted the ball past Sergio Asenjo in the Villarreal goal.

Cameroon international M'bia gave the away side a two-goal advantage after 26 minutes. Villarreal failed to clear a set piece and Benoit Tremoulinas delivered from the left and the midfielder got in front of Juanme to head home.

Vietto halved the deficit moments after half-time when Denis Cheryshev's strike fell kindly to the Argentine youngster via the arm of M'Bia before he finished past Sergio Rico - his sixth goal in the competition this season.

There was some confusion about whether the goal had stood as Sevilla defenders seemed to think the officials had awarded a penalty for handball, but the goal stood.

Any fears of a Villarreal comeback were quelled as the two-goal advantage was immediately restored. Vicente Iborra headed a set piece back into the danger area and Gameiro smashed home.
