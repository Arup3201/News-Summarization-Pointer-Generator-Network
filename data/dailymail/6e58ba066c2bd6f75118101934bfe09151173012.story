It isn't often Paris Saint-Germain are compared to Shrewsbury Town, but that is exactly what Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho did when accusing the French side of 'aggressive tactics'.

Mourinho made the comments ahead of Wednesday night's crucial Champions League last-16 clash at Stamford Bridge after a feisty 1-1 draw in the first leg.

He said: 'I was surprised because a team with fantastic players was the team with a record number of fouls.

'This season we've played against sides form the Championship in the cups, against teams from League One, and Shrewsbury from League Two, but the most aggressive team was PSG.'

Eden Hazard was often the victim at the Parc des Princes, though Laurent Blanc has also claimed Diego Costa is capable of 'dirty tricks' and has told the referee to watch out.

It promises to be a tough night for Bjorn Kuipers. Not only with PSG, but with Chelsea - who have committed more fouls than PSG in the competition this season - and Nemanja Matic, whose foul-count is higher than any of Blanc's players.

But as the two teams look to reach the quarter-finals, who are the PSG players Mourinho feels so strongly about? Are they more aggressive than those in a League two side?

David Luiz and Thiago Silva

Graceful, skillful, blessed with flair; those are the characteristics usually associated with Brazilian footballers... but not these two defenders. Their rugged approach against Chelsea in the first leg angered the visiting players.

That was especially case with former Blues defender Luiz. The unconventional centre back was obviously eager to make a point to Mourinho, who sold him for a staggering fee of £50million in the summer.

Luiz operated in midfield in Paris and clattered into Hazard and Cesc Fabregas, as well as going head-to-head with Costa. He is set to operate further back on Wednesday night, so will look to join forces with Thiago Silva and get on Costa's nerves again.

Marco Verratti

In a midfield three that usually sees tough-tacklers Thiago Motta and Blaise Matuidi surround him, Verratti - who has been compared to Andrea Pirlo - is often looked at as the 'nice guy'.

But the Italian youngster showed he had a bit of the Paul Scholes about him as he launched into tackles against Chelsea last month. One in particular, on Hazard once again, should have resulted in a red card for the 22-year-old.

His passing range and balance on the ball is something to be admired, but Oscar, Willian and Hazard should be wary of more late lunges from Verratti and co.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic

'Even a player like Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), a typical attacking player – came back when they lost the ball and attacked Hazard from behind when we were countering,' Mourinho claimed in his press conference on Tuesday. 

The controversial striker may not be regarded as much of a team player and rarely defends from the front with his running, but it is evident he will do what it takes to win.

The Swede has been sent off 10 times in his club career, with offences including slapping a player in the face. He has only just returned to action after serving a two-game ban after going in studs-up, over the top of the ball against Saint-Etienne.

Chelsea beware. 

Ibrahimovic comes from behind to take down Hazard... will he be in that mood again at Stamford Bridge?
