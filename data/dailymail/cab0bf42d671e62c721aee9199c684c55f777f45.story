Brazil poster boy Neymar carries the hopes of a nation on his shoulders - but from the smile on his face you wouldn't know it.

The 22-year-old forward has already lit up the World Cup by netting four times for the hosts but he suffered knee and thigh injuries in Brazil's last-16 clash with Chile.

He is expected to be fit for the quarter-finals, however, and he has posted a selfie on Instagram showing the squad waiting to be fed at a long dinner table.
