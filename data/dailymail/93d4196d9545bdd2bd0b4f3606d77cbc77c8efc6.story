A puppy that was shot in the head and thrown in the river in Wales but amazingly survived is now looking for a new home.

The four-month-old puppy, named Ceri after the policewoman who rescued her, was shot through the skull with a pellet gun and had to endure lifesaving treatment.

The white and tan lurcher was discovered on January 2 by startled Pc Ceri Hassall, who spotted the drowning dog in the the River Rhondda, which runs past the police station in Porth, Rhondda Valleys, where she works.

Pc Hassall and her colleagues rushed to Ceri’s rescue and took her to a local vet.

Pc Hassall said: 'I heard a loud noise coming from the direction of the river, so I climbed over the wall and called for my colleague to come over to pass the dog to him.

'We then took the dog to the police station and called the animal aid agency.'

The dog was bleeding when Pc Hassall found her.

She said: 'When I found her she was in a bad state with blood coming out of her mouth and nose, and she had a wound on her head. It's a miracle she's alive.

'We are appealing for people who may have information about what may have happened to the puppy to come forward.

'If it was an intentional act of cruelty whoever was responsible need to be caught. Her injuries suggest she was shot with an air rifle, but there was no pellet and we can't be certain.'

Beverley Price, of Dogs Trust Bridgend -
 where Ceri is currently being nursed back to full health - said the 
callous nature of the act 'defies belief'.

'It’s miraculous Ceri survived such a horrific ordeal,' Ms Price said.

'Remarkably she still adores people and as soon as she recovered from her injuries she became a happy, bouncy little dog who lives life to the full.

'All her carers have fallen in love with her.'

Ceri (the dog, pictured) is now looking for 'an active and patient owner who can keep up with her energy'

Ceri is now looking for a loving new home with an active, patient owner who can keep up with her energy and enthusiasm.

'This sweet girl has a gentle nature and can live with another compatible dog,' said Beverley Price.

Police are currently investigating the matter.

Pc Hassall said: 'We have a few leads. I like to think it was fate that she ended up next door to a police station.'
