Of all the ways to make a romantic gesture to a long-distance girlfriend, this may be the cheesiest yet.

Richard McKeever missed his sweetheart Juliet  so much after she moved 240 miles away that he ordered pizza to both his and her houses so they could enjoy it on Skype.

To top off the grand gesture, the delivery driver arrived with a bunch of flowers and candles while a violinist was sent along to serenade her as she sipped champagne and tucked into her takeaway.

A bit cheesy: Richard McKeever ordered a pizza for his girfriend, Juliet, 240 miles away in a romantic gesture which included a violinist and flowers

Mr McKeever, 26, came up with idea after Juliet, 21, moved back to Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, to finish her biochemistry degree

Mr McKeever, 26, came up with the idea to sweep his girlfriend, 21, off her feet after she moved back to England from Belfast, Northern Ireland, to finish her biochemistry degree at the University of Warwick.

Determined to make sure the 240-mile distance over the Irish Sea would not impact on the relationship, he arranged the surprise pizza delivery.

Juliet said: 'To say I was shocked was an understatement - it's not exactly your normal pizza delivery.

'It caused a bit of commotion on the street too as passers-by stopped to stare and my neighbours didn't have a clue what was going on.

'I was so touched and overwhelmed that Richard managed to pull this off.' 

The couple have been together for seven months after sparking up a relationship online.

The couple, who met online and have been together for seven months, are determined to not let the distance impact on their relationship

After discussing their love of music with each other, they began talking over Skype until they made the decision to meet.

Juliet flew out to meet her future boyfriend in Belfast, where he greeted her at the airport.

Romance blossomed and lovestruck Juliet even organised a research placement in Belfast over the summer to be closer to her new beau.

Now she has moved away, Mr McKeever hopes to keep the sparks flying over long distance.

The coffee shop worker said: 'Long distance relationships can be tricky and it's the little things you miss, like having dinner together and curling up on the sofa with a pizza and a film.

'I thought a bit of old fashioned romance might be able to help to bridge the gap.

'We talk every day. Skype, texts, phone calls. I'm amazed we aren't sick of each other.'
