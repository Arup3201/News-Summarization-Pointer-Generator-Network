A third teenager is to be charged in the case of a Massachusetts teenager who was allegedly sexually assaulted and left for dead in woods near Saugus.

Video clips showing the intoxicated 16-year-old girl's ordeal were then distributed on Snapchat.

All three of the accused teenagers involved in the crime are now being held without bail.

Timothy Cyckowski, 17, faces charges of kidnapping and posing a child in a state of nudity, according to Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett's office.

Authorities allege Cyckowski used the Snapchat application to send a young woman at least four videos of a girl she knew being sexually assaulted

The latest suspect,Timothy Cyckowski, 17, faces charges of kidnapping and posing a child in a state of nudity, according to Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett's office.

Two other Saugus residents, Rashad Deihim, 19, and Kailyn Bonia, 18, have also been charged.  

Authorities allege Cyckowski used the Snapchat application to send a young woman at least four videos of a girl she knew being sexually assaulted. 

Prosecutors say the assault took place September 3rd behind Waybright Elementary School in Saugus. 

The victim in the video was so intoxicated that she could not speak or stand up, prosecutors say. 

The young woman who received the videos is credited with alerting police to the incident.

Timothy Cyckowski,17, who sent the Snapchat videos to a friend of the victim's can be 'heard in the background laughing in the videos.'

The woman managed to capture screenshots of the video clips which normally disappear within seconds of being sent, and convinced Cyckowski to disclose his location, prosecutors say. Authorities say if she had not notified police, the teenager being assaulted in the video would have likely died.

Defense attorney Eitan Goldberg argued Thursday that Cyckowski should be released to home confinement under GPS monitoring because 'his role was significantly less' than his co-defendants, Bonia and Deihim.

But Assistant District Attorney Kate MacDougall said Cyckowski was essentially 'cheering on' the alleged assault. 

Suspect Rashad Deihim, 19, (pictured in September had been on the run for weeks, turned himself into police

Cyckowski's parents were in the courtroom for today's hearing. The teen's father, 37-year-old Matthew Cyckowski, has also been charged.

A grand jury indicted the elder Cyckowski last month on one count of misleading police. Prosecutors allege the elder Cyckowski got rid of the cellphone that could link his son to the crime.

They say when police asked for his son's cellphone, the elder Cyckowski turned over his own phone, saying it belonged to the boy. 

Prior to handing in the phone, he transferred his son's telephone number to his own phone, according to prosecutors.

It was revealed that Cyckowski threw away his phone after the incident and even got his dad to lie to police 

Authorities believe the cellphone has been destroyed and will not be recovered.

Police found the severely intoxicated 16-year-old after a friend of the victim saw the graphic footage on the video and photo-sharing app recognized the location and led them to the scene. 

Court documents state the girl was foaming at the mouth when she arrived at hospital, possibly on a narcotic and had cuts all over body  - when detectives interviewed her days later she could not recalled what had happened.

The victim's mother told WHDH, her daughter was drugged, sexually assaulted and left for dead.

 'What they did was disgusting it was sick, I almost lost my daughter,' the mother said. 

'She was barely breathing she was found with nothing on.'  

'She had fingerprints, at least two hands held down by her throat. '

Police found the girl partially-naked and covered in cuts and bruises in woods behind Waybright Elementary School (pictured) in Sangus, Massachusetts

'Her breasts were bruised, her whole body was ripped, shredded, broken toes.'

'Somebody noticed who it was and called the cops, and if this person didn't call the cops my daughter wouldn't be here right now,' the mom said. 

Yesterday Assistant Essex District Attorney Erin Bellavia stated graphic details of the video, in which she said Deihim can be clearly identified, reports the Boston Herald. 

Deihim had his pants unzipped and suspect  Bonia can be 'seen wrapping her arms around the victim's neck as if she was strangling her while grabbing at the victim's naked body,' Bellavia said. 

Deihim (pictured) and Bonia are charged with assault with intent to rape, indecent assault and battery on a person 14 or older, posing a child in a state of nudity and kidnapping

Deihim, who denies the charges, was deemed dangerous and held without bail alongside Bonia

'She attempted to run away naked in one of the videos but she could not because she was so impaired,' Bellavia said and added that she is seen shaking her head as if to to protest against their actions.

Bellavia said Timothy Cyckowski,17, who sent the Snapchat videos to a friend of the victim's can be 'heard in the background laughing in the videos.'

Deihim and Bonia are charged with assault with intent to rape, indecent assault and battery on a person 14 or older, posing a child in a state of nudity and kidnapping. 

Timothy Cyckowski is charged as a juvenile with identical charges and distribution of child pornography.

The victim's mother is calling for the trio to be charged with attempted murder saying: 'Somebody noticed who it was and called the cops, and if this person didn't call the cops my daughter wouldn't be here right now,'

A report by an officer who arrived at the scene said: 'The female appeared to be extremely intoxicated.

'I conducted a search of the area and located what we believe is the scene where the sexual activity took place on a floral print couch in the wooded area about 100 feet from the baseball field.'  

Lynn court records show Deihim has been the subject of four restraining orders, according to the Boston Globe - one on behalf of a younger sibling, one from his mother, and two for a female Saugus High student

The victim's friend who received the Snapchat videos took screen shots, according to a police report.

The victim's friend asked the juvenile defendant where he was and he said, 'Waybright, but then realized he gave up where they were and panicked,' the report said.

The two friends spoke after the victim was released from the hospital which is when the victim thanked the girl 'for saving her life,' the report said.
