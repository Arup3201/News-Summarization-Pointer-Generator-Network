Levski Sofia have taken the extraordinary step of firing their goalkeeper, after his gaffes gifted Beroe Stara Zagora a 2-1 win in the Bulgarian league on Sunday.  

The inexperienced keeper, Stefano Kunchev, who is only 23 years old, was shown no mercy by the Sofia club.

The club are one of the most popular in Bulgaria, along with CSKA Sofia, but the defeat left them just  a point above the relegation zone.

Down and out: Stefano Kunchev was given the boot after making one mistake too many for Levski Sofia

Levski are notorious for their ruthlessness, and have changed managers so frequently over the last few years  that they make Roman Abramovich look like having the patience of a saint.

In total, they have changed their head coach 14 times since 2008, with new boss Georgi Ivanov  replacing former Atletico Madrid and Celta Vigo manager Jose 'Pepe' Murcia earlier this month. It is Ivanov's second spell in charge of the side, and Sunday was the first game of his new reign.

Goalkeepers around the world will be hoping that Kunchev's dismissal won't set a dangerous precedent - the likes of Joe Hart, Iker Casillas and David de Gea might all have been laid off in recent years if their clubs had borrowed Levski's trigger-happy approach.
