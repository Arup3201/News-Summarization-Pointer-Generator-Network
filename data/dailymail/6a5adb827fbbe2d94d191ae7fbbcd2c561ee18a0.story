A 28-year-old man has been sentenced to eight months in jail for using a gun to hold a woman he had met through a dating website hostage for three hours.

Drew Francis Thompson, from Canberra, was found guilty by the ACT Supreme Court of aggravated burglary, unlawful confinement, assault, and carrying a firearm for his actions in November 2013, which were described as 'productive of terror'.

Mr Thompson met the young woman, then 21, through online dating site eHarmony in March 2013, who broke off the relationship after accusing him of having bad fashion sense, living at home with his parents, and still being a student.

The 28-year-old attempted to rekindle their relationship, but the woman resisted, and finally relented to meet with him at a shopping centre in Dickson on the grounds that it would be the last time they would see each other.

Mr Thompson told the court that he had been humiliated by the young woman's words, and that she told him he was 'boring' and 'too simple to be her partner'.

The young woman told the court that she had been 'cruel' to Mr Thompson, and that she had 'yelled at him' and 'humiliated him'. 

A month after the meeting, Mr Thompson broke into her apartment while the young woman was home, wearing medical gloves and carrying a gun, and hid behind the door of her bedroom while she was in the bathroom.

The court reported that when she entered the room, wearing only underpants, Mr Thompson grabbed the woman, put his hand over her mouth and told her not to scream, before forcing her onto her bed with his gun resting on her chest. 

'That situation is immediately productive of terror,' said Acting Justice David Robinson during Friday's sentencing, noting that the young woman said she could still smell the glove to this day.

After three hours, Mr Thompson left the apartment, and the now 22-year-old went to the police, reporting that she was in fear for her life and believed that he might come back. 

'Fear and insecurity have been and still are an everyday part of her life. She has been and is still unable to fully participate in life. Fear and distrust are prominent,' Acting Justice Robinson told the court.

'The contrast to her previous participation in life with its joys is stark.  She is receiving ongoing psychological assistance and is driven by stress, sleeplessness and hyper vigilance.'

The judge found that Mr Thompson may have been suffering from a depressive mental condition at the time of the incident, but noted that he expressed little remorse or empathy for the distress that he caused the woman. 

He said that Mr Thompson appeared to wish to 'impress upon her the gravity of the distress that she had inflicted upon him', and that he took 'the gun to the apartment with the intention of harming' her.

'[She] had exhibited a distinct dislike of guns. The use of guns upset her and made her uncomfortable because she connected them with violence. The offender was a gun enthusiast,' Acting Justice Robinson said. 

The judge said that he believed Mr Thompson showed good prospects for rehabilitation, due to his new girlfriend, his supportive family, and the counselling he was receiving.  

Mr Thompson, who has already served a month in jail, was sentenced to two years for his crimes, and was to continue serving his sentence until December this year, from which time it will be suspended.
