A producer for Michael Jackson’s doomed comeback tour testified Wednesday that the singer’s frail physique and confused ramblings about speaking to God had her convinced  he was at death’s door days before he died.

Alif Sankey, an associate producer for the tour’s London concerts, told the court that Jackson was extremely thin and telling people he was talking to God and she was fearful he would soon die but that she felt helpless.

Sankey told the Los Angeles Times that her fears drove her to reach out to the director of the This Is It tour Kenny Ortega.

‘”I said, 'He needs to be put in the hospital now,”’ Sankey said she told Ortega on June 20, 2009. ‘I kept saying, “Michael's dying, he's dying.”’

On June 25, just five days later, Sankey’s fears would come true when Jackson was found dead from an overdose of the anesthetic propofol.

The court heard that when propofol is administered to a patient, a number of staff should be on hand equipped with sophisticated medical devices to intervene if the patient stops breathing.

A toxicologist witness described the singer's use of the drug propofol as 'very problematic' in previous testimony.

Frail: Sankey said Jackson was abnormally thin and that she reached out to concert promoter AEG with fears he was dying

The crux of the case comes in the form of shamed physician Dr. Conrad Murray. The doctor administered the drug that killed Jackson and was subsequently tried and convicted of involuntary manslaughter for his role in the pop legend’s death.

Jackson's mother Katherine and Jackson’s three children are suing concert promotion company AEG Live for millions, claiming it should have vetted Murray before allowing the singer to employ him as his personal physician.

AEG claims it was Jackson who wanted Murray brough on as part of the tour.However, Sankey’s testimony painted a different picture, one that showed AEG to be Murray’s employer.

The LA Times points to an email between AEG executive Paul Gongaware and Ortega concerning the physician, on which Sankey was copied.

‘We want to remind him it is AEG, not Michael Jackson who is paying his salary,’ Gongaware wrote. ‘We want him to understand what is expected of him.’

Sankey testified that Ortega had planned a 'tough love' meeting with Jackson and that she and Ortega were very concerned after Jackson told Ortega he'd been speaking to god.

'[Michael] didn't understand why God was speaking to him. We were both crying. We were crying because he seemed — he was not speaking normally to Kenny,' she said.

Sankey, who also cried during her testimony, was the fifth witness to take the stand in the trial.

Karen Faye, a makeup artist who worked with Jackson for some 30 years, also testified for the Jacksons.

Faye said that during the ‘Dangerous’ tour of the early 1990s, promoters asked that she give Jackson injections of pain medications, but she refused. She says a tour manager who later became a top AEG executive then enlisted a doctor to treat Jackson.

Sankey, who first met Jackson as a dancer on the set of 1987’s ‘Smooth Criminal’ went on to describe in her testimony Jackson’s relationship with his children. ‘They loved their daddy,’ she said.
