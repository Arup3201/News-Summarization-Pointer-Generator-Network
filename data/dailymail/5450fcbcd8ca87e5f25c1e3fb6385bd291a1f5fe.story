The captain of the U.S. women's hockey team threw out the first pitch at Thursday's series finale between the Yankees and the Red Sox at Boston's Fenway Park, and the Massachusetts native used her moment in the spotlight to take a dig at shamed Yankee pitcher Michael Pineda.

Pineda was suspended this week for 10 games after he was caught with pine tar on his neck in the second inning of Wednesday night's game between the two rival clubs - the sticky substance is a big no-no for MLB pitchers as the league believes it can give them an unfair advantage.

So when Meghan Duggan took the mound at Fenway on Thursday to deliver the first pitch, she had a little fun at Pineda's expense.

Comedian: Meghan Duggan mocks Yankee pitcher Michael Pineda by reaching for her neck in the same spot umpires found illegal pine tar on the Yankee pitcher

Last laugh: The Yankees got the last laugh Thursday, beating the Red Sox 14-5

Just before she threw her pitch, Duggan jokingly reached to her neck in the same area where the pine tar was found on Pineda.

The Yankees got the last laugh, however, spanking the Sox 14-5 for the team's fifth win against Boston so far this season.

Pineda was 
ejected in the second inning of Wednesday night's 5-1 loss at Fenway 
Park after umpires found the pine tar on his neck.

After the game, Pineda admitted he had used the pine tar to help him hold the ball on a cool, windy night.

'I'll learn from this mistake,' he said. 'It won't happen again.'

Pine
 tar is a sticky substance that baseball players will often put on the 
handles of their bats to improve grip. Pitchers will use it for the same
 reason, particularly in cold weather.

However, MLB rules say that a 
pitcher can't put any foreign substance on the ball because it can 
potentially make the ball move more when a pitcher throws a curve ball. 
So pitchers will often try and hide it. If they get caught, they are 
typically thrown out of the game - and that's exactly what happened to 
Pineda.

Busted: The substance was clearly visible on the pitcher's neck

The
 right-hander was thrown out in the second inning when plate umpire 
Gerry Davis found the substance on the right side of Pineda's neck after
 Red Sox manager John Farrell asked him to check. Pineda walked from the
 mound without protest.

Both Pineda and Davis said it was pine tar.

'When
 it's that obvious, something has got to be said,' Farrell explained 
after the game. 'Our awareness was heightened, given what we had seen in
 the past.'

The ejection also set off a debate in the baseball world about pitchers who use pine tar, and whether it should be allowed in certain circumstances. Many former aces said they had done it, albeit in a more discreet manner.

Rule 8.02(b) prohibits pitchers from altering the ball to gain an unfair advantage, and forbids them from having a foreign substance on them or in their possession on the mound.

Pineda wasn't seen with the pine tar in the first inning, when the Red Sox roughed him up. Boston manager John Farrell asked plate umpire Gerry Davis to check Pineda after two fast outs the next inning.

Got ya: Umpire Gerry Davis determined that the substance on Pineda's neck was pine tar, which is against the rules for pitchers

Earlier 
this month, Pineda pitched well against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. 
Television cameras showed a substance on his hand during that outing â€” 
Pineda said it was dirt, not pine tar.

Among
 other suspensions of pitchers for pine tar in the past decade, Tampa 
Bay's Joel Peralta was penalized eight games in 2012, the Angels' 
Brendan Donnelly 10 days in 2005 and St. Louis' Julian Tavarez 10 days 
in 2004. The suspensions of Donnelly and Tavarez were cut to eight days 
after they asked the players' association to appeal, and Peralta dropped
 his challenge with no reduction.

Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Pineda and the organization were 'embarrassed.'

Yankees manager Joe Girardi called it 'an error in judgment' and a 'little bump' and 'poor judgment.'

'He had a hard time gripping the baseball. Unknown to us, he put it on and went out there,' Girardi said. 'It's a young kid. I don't think he's trying to do anything, cheat. I think he's just trying to go out there and compete.'

Obvious: Boston manager John Farrell said that when it's as obvious as it was on Pineda, he has to alert the umpires

In Pineda's previous start against the Red Sox, a 4-1 Yankees win in New York on April 10, television cameras caught Pineda with what appeared to be sticky pine tar on his hand on a cool night. Farrell didn't see a photograph of Pineda's hand until the fourth inning; when Pineda came out to warm up for the fifth, his hand was clean.

Pineda said the dark substance was dirt but it sparked debate about pitchers' use of sticky substances to get a better grip on cool nights.

On Wednesday, with the game time temperature at 50 degrees, Sizemore started the first with a triple and scored on Dustin Pedroia's single. With one out, Mike Napoli singled Pedroia to third. After Mike Carp flied to left, A.J. Pierzynski singled up the middle, scoring Pedroia.

After Pineda's ejection, David Phelps came in and completed the strikeout of Sizemore.

Trend: A similar brown, sticky substance was seen on Pineda's hand in another game against Boston on April 10

John Lackey (3-2) allowed one run and seven hits in eight innings with 11 strikeouts and no walks. Koji Uehara struck out three in the ninth in a non-save situation.

The previous time Lackey faced the Yankees he allowed four homers in a 7-2 loss on April 12. On Wednesday, he struck out the side in the third then had two strikeouts in each of the next two innings.

Mike Napoli had three hits and Boston scored two runs in the first and two more in the third. The Yankees scored on Alfonso Soriano's sacrifice fly in the sixth.
