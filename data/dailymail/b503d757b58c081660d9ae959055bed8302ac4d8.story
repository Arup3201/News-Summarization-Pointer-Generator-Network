A burglar who stole £15,000 of rare instruments from an orchestra and sold them at his local Cash Converters shop for £60 so he could fund his drug habit has been jailed.

Scott Wilson took a £7,000 cello and an £8,000 violin belonging to members of the Europe Orchestral Ensemble which were due to perform at Customs House in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, on February 9. 

The owner of the Muller cello said he was left devastated after the theft because it stopped him from being able to perform and make money.

He told detectives: 'I can no longer complete our European tour with the orchestra. 

'The cello is my life and my livelihood. This has had a great impact on my life.'

The stolen violin was a rare Lorenz Neudorf, made in 1878, which was in a case with two Fretschner bows.

Its owner said: 'My violin is everything to me. It is almost impossible to replace.'

It was only after the thief saw an 
appeal to trace the precious items that he realised what he had done and
contacted police himself.

Vic
Laffey, defending, told the court: 'The defendant became aware of the 
value involved in relation to these matters when he read about it in the
local paper.

'Until that point he had not a clue these thing were worth as much as they were.

'When he became aware, he telephoned the detective constable and told him where the items were and admitted his involvement. 

'Thankfully there was no damage at all.'

Wilson, of no fixed address, admitted burglary at the performance venue as well as at Flagg Court Health Centre in South Shields where he stole a £300 iPhone from a worker’s pocket and the Mecca Bingo in the town where he stole a £350 television set, both in February

Wilson asked for 13 other burglaries to be taken into consideration by the judge. 

The court heard they all, except one, happened in February when Wilson targeted public buildings including hospitals, a funeral parlour, a hotel and the Sage music and arts centre in Gateshead.

He had been given a community order for shoplifting and criminal damage just nine days before the Customs House raid. 

Judge Penny Moreland sentenced Wilson to a total of 19 months in jail. 

The judge told him: 'In respect of the Customs House you stole extremely valuable, unique instruments, causing, no doubt, great distress to those who owned them. 

'Though, I accept, and it is to your credit, you facilitated the recovery of them once you realised what it was you had stolen.'

Mr Laffey told the court Wilson was homeless and owed money for drugs at the time.

He said: 'The background to all these offences is essentially the same, this young man is a drug addict. 

'He was stealing on impulse, trying to generate money.'
