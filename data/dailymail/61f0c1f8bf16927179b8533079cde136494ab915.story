 Everton have drawn Lille, Wolfsburg, and FC Krasnodar in Group H of the 2014/15 Europa League.

Roberto Martinez's side secured their place in this year's competition after finishing 5th in the Premier League last season - therefore assuring them a spot in the group stages.

Everton will play each of their opponents home and away, and matches will take place on 18 September, 2 and 23 October, 6 and 27 November and 11 December.

The last time the Toffees competed in a European competition was in the Europa League in 2009/10 - the tournament's first season under its new name.

Then under the stewardship of David Moyes, Everton finished second in a group containing Benfica (group winners), BATE Borisov, and AEK Athens.

Moyes' men then went on to face Sporting Lisbon in the Round of 32, where they lost 4-2 on aggregate.

The final of this year's competition will take place at Stadion Narodowy in Warsaw, on May 27, where for the first time the winner will secure a place in next season's Champions League.

Draw: Roberto Martinez, whose Everton side will face Lille, Wolfsburg, and FC Krasnodar in Group H, is making his European management debut

Star man: Salomon Kalou is the star turn of the French side, however, recent interest from Sunderland  may mean Lille need to find goals from elsewhere if the former Chelsea striker heads back to the Premier League.

Manager: René Girard

Stadium: Stade Pierre-Mauroy, Lille

European pedigree: Lille return to European football this season after missing out altogether in the 2013/14 season having finished sixth the year before.

Did you know: Prior to the Second World War, Lille had two football teams - Olympique Lillois and Sporting Club Fivois. The two clubs merged after the end of the war, creating Lille OSC. 

 

Star man: Veteran striker Ivica Olic could be a thorn in the sides of Group H.

Manager: Dieter Hecking

Stadium: Volkswagen Arena, Wolfsburg  

European pedigree: Wolfsburg made their Champions League debut in the 2009/10 season but were knocked out of Group B, a group which contained Manchester United, CSKA Moscow and Besiktas.

Did you know: Whilst under the control of current Fulham manager Felix Magath, Wolfsburg made their surge up the Bundesliga. In 2007, Magath took them to fifth in the league before finishing champions the following year.

 

Star man: Brazilian midfielder Joaozinho has provided the much needed goals for FC Krasnodar in the league and Europe so far this season. 

Manager: Aleh Konanaw

Stadium: Kuban Stadium, Krasnodar

European pedigree: This is only FC Krasnodar's second appearance in Europe after reaching the group stage of last year's competition, in which they faced Swansea City in Group A. 

Did you know: FC Krasnodar impressively knocked Real Sociedad out of Europe in the third qualifying round with a 3-1 aggregate win.
