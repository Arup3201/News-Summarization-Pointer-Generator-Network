Nico Rosberg ended Lewis Hamilton's dominant streak by finishing final practice for the Spanish Grand Prix on top of the timesheets.

After seeing his Mercedes team-mate, and rival for the championship, end both practice sessions quickest on Friday, Rosberg responded with a time of 1:25.887 - over eight tenths quicker than the Briton - on Saturday morning.

Fernando Alonso was third quickest in his Ferrari, with Sebastian Vettel, who completed just four laps yesterday, only tenth, and over two seconds adrift of Rosberg.

You've got in on the wrong way round, Dan: Ricciardo was in jovial mood ahead of Saturday's practice session

Rosberg 
qualified on pole in Spain a year ago and will be looking to repeat the 
feat to turn the momentum back his way after seeing Hamilton whittle the
 overall lead down to four points followiing consecutive wins in 
Malaysia, Bahrain and China.

Hamilton
 was keeping his powder dry however, with the 2008 world champion seeing
 no need to take part in the final 10 minutes of the session.

Whereas
 the Briton had an untroubled day on Friday, Rosberg suffered cooling 
problems and was eager to make up for the lost time. He did 16 laps to 
his team mate's nine on Saturday morning, with his fastest on the medium
 tyre.

Brazilian
 Felipe Massa went fourth fastest for Williams while Frenchman Romain 
Grosjean put in an impressive lap for Lotus, still without a point this 
season, in fifth.

Australian
 Daniel Ricciardo was the fastest Red Bull driver, in seventh place, 
with quadruple world champion Sebastian Vettel 10th but getting some 
laps under his belt after a day on the sidelines due to an electrical 
problem.
