Crystal Palace are confident of tying Yannick Bolasie down to a new contract by the start of the season.

The winger was one of the club's star performers last season as they successfully battled against relegation.

Bolasie has just 12 months left on his contract, meaning he can leave for nothing at the end of next season.

Stay: Palace want to keep hold of Bolasie, whose contract runs out with the club in 12 months

But talks over an extension are underway and Palace officials are hopeful of concluding a deal in the coming weeks.

Securing Bolasie's future would be a huge boost to manager Tony Pulis ahead of the new season.

Cardiff defender Steven Caulker is high on Pulis' shopping list after missing out on signing Joleon Lescott.
