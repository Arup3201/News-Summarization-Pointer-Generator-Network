Ratings plunge?: Much-derided Splash! has gone some way to silence its critics after pulling in 5.15million viewers on Saturday

It is excruciatingly bad television lambasted by critics as ‘horrendous’ and ‘idiotic’.

But the ratings suggest ITV1’s Splash! has become a guilty pleasure for the nation.

The second episode of the much-ridiculed show which sees celebrities dive for glory under the mentorship of Olympic medallist Tom Daley pulled in a remarkable 5.15 million viewers – making it the most watched programme on Saturday night.

But the popularity of the inane programme will be a blow to Clare Balding’s high-brow BBC1 rival Britain’s Brightest which is struggling to compete.

The second episode of the quiz show, which tests the intelligence of ordinary Britons by assessing them over a range of disciplines, dropped 800,000 viewers to 4million on Saturday.

Audiences have admitted that Splash is becoming a 'guilty pleasure' despite the widespread criticism.

Kate Gibson said: ‘I secretly love Splash so much.’

Sally Biddulph admitted: ‘Splash is becoming a guilty pleasure - strangely gripping format, really like it.’

Others have said that Miss Balding’s new BBC show is little better than Splash despite having a more highbrow title, and have questioned why it has escaped criticism.

Mo Akle said: ‘Splash! might be bad but Britain’s Brightest is phenomenally dire.’

Dan Smith added: ‘This Britain’s Brightest programme seems to be competing with Splash for the title of worst TV show. EVER.’

Splash sees an array of low-rent celebrities learn to dive with the help and advice of 18-year-old Tom and diving coach Andy Banks

Each week celebrities including former model Caprice, skier Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards, and comedian Omid Djalli, compete by performing a dive in front of a panel of experts and pool-side audience.

It is hosted by Gabby Logan and Vernon Kay, while the panel of judges include comedienne Jo Brand and retired Olympic diver Leon Taylor.

Britain’s Brightest sees 24 ordinary people to have their intelligence tested in a variety of ways including memory, speed and emotional intelligence.

Daley has come under fire for his involvement in the show – British Swimming chief executive David Sparkes expressed concerns about the impact of the teenager’s commercial commitments on his ability to train and compete.

Mr Sparkes said: ‘Tom is an incredibly talented young man, but he’s yet to achieve his full potential and it’s only going to get harder to achieve that Olympic gold medal as he gets older.

‘You can rest assured the next Chinese diving superstar will not have such distractions from training.

‘He should look at the example of skaters Torvill and Dean who waited until the end of their competitive careers before doing such programmes.’
