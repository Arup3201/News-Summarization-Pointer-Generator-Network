Usually the only time we would be able to see some of the world's most beautiful landscapes would be when flying over on a plane. 

Thankfully we don't have to wait until our next flight to witness the incredible sights from above as we can now gaze down on the wonders with the breathtaking aerial photography from AirPano.

This adventurous team travel the world providing fresh perspectives on the most famous locations, including the Dubai skyline and Mount Everest.

Dubai never ceases to impress, but this aerial shot of the skyline by AirPano shows the city in an incredible new light

Only a photograph from above like this one can demonstrate the vast size of the Angel Falls in Venezuela

This perfectly ordered city is Barcelona in Spain - captured in the middle is the famous Sagrada Familia church

The team consists of nine photographers and three tech specialists, who began their mission in 2006. 

AirPano took to the skies after creating a bucket list of the 100 Best Places on the Planet. 

They planned to work their way through the list and now have a portfolio of 230 locations shot from above. 

Project coordinator Sergey Semenov revealed the team initially worked with spherical panoramas on land, which then led to them using planes and helicopters. 

Now they rely on drones to capture their beautiful panoramic shots. 

Their work includes the most famous urban skylines such as New York, Paris and Barcelona, as well as featuring natural landscapes like waterfalls and volcanos.  

They next hope to add Portugal, Indonesia, Japan and the United Kingdom to their extensive list.  

You can not only see the photos but also explore the bird eye view perspectives using their interactive site.

Iguasu Falls, Argentina is just one of the stunning aerial shots shown off in AirPano's spectacular collection

Sergey, 32, said: 'It's unlike viewing a traditional photograph limited by its frame.

'A spherical, 360 degree panorama gives you a freedom of being at the location, where you can turn your head around and have a closer look at every detail.

'The 360 degree panorama technology creates a complete illusion of a personal presence on the spot when it viewed on a large screen.

'It makes you feel as if you are in the sky above New York City, underwater, above the raging waterfall, and even inside a microwave oven.

'You can take time to move in closer and study interesting objects, or 'fly' to another place in a virtual tour by simply moving your hand.'
