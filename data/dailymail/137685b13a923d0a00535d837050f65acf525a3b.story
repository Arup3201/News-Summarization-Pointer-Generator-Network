The Vatican's chief accountant has been ordered to remain in prison following his arrest over an alleged plot to smuggle 20 million euros from Switzerland to Italy.

Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, was denied house arrest and will remain at Rome's Queen of Heaven prison until a decision is made as to whether to indict him.

Scarano, the bishop of Salerno, was taken into custody last week along 
with an Italian secret agent Mario Zito and broker Giovanni Carenzio.

Arrest: Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, the bishop of Salerno, the chief accountant for the Vatican's vast property portfolio, has been taken into custody

Scarano,
61, who worked at Deutsche bank before taking ecclesiastical vows, is 
accused of fraud, corruption, and other charges, as part of a wider 
investigation into the IOR Vatican Bank.]

His nickname in Vatican circles
was reportedly ‘Don 500 Euros’ thanks to his habit of showing people 
that he had only the largest bank note in his wallet.

Friends of his had allegedly asked him to negotiate with Carenzio to return 20 million euros they had given him to invest.

After persuading Carenzio to return the money, he and Italian secret service agent Zito, allegedly went to Switzerland to smuggle the cash back aboard an Italian government aircraft.

Scarano is also under investigation for alleged money-laundering 
stemming from his account at the Vatican's bank, called the Institute 
for Religious Works, or IOR.

The investigation concerns transactions he made while an official at the Administration for the Patrimony of the
Apostolic See, in 2009.

He reportedly took 560,000 euros ($729,000) 
in cash out of his personal IOR bank account and carried it out of the 
Vatican and into Italy to help pay off a mortgage on his Salerno home.

It is the latest in a long series of financial scandals which have rocked the Vatican bank and embarrassed the papacy.

Last week, Pope Francis named five 
people to head a commission of inquiry into the bank, the Institute for 
Religious Works, or IOR, to get to the root of the problems that have 
plagued it for decades and mired the Vatican in scandal over the years.

At the start of this week, the top two managers at the IOR resigned. 
Their boss, bank president Ernst von Freyberg, had just weeks earlier 
praised Paolo Cipriani and Massimo Tulli as 'truly happy' and helpful 
collaborators as the bank worked to comply with anti-money-laundering 
norms.

Von 
Freyberg said it was clear that the bank needed new leadership 'to 
increase the pace' of the IOR's transformation - a suggestion that the 
two managers had in some way held back that transformation.

And by the end of the week, von Freyberg was even more blunt in briefing the bank's board about the Scarano case.

'The
internal investigation that I have initiated has proven effective and 
discovered clear failings,' von Freyberg told the board, according to 
excerpts of his remarks obtained Friday by The Associated Press. 'That 
should serve as a stark reminder of the urgency of improving (the) IOR's
processes.'

He said the 
bank was reviewing each of the IOR's 19,000 accounts 'and we will 
systematically identify and eradicate wrongdoing of clients in our 
institute.'

The high profile arrests come just 48 hours after Pope Francis announced the line up for his commission into the Vatican Bank

One of those Italian investigations formally wrapped up on Friday as prosecutors prepare to request indictments: In 2010, Rome prosecutors placed Cipriani and the IOR's then-president, Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, under investigation for allegedly violating Italy's anti-money-laundering norms with a routine bank transaction involving an IOR account at an Italian bank.

Police seized 23 million euros, though it was later ordered released.

Italian news reports said prosecutors would exonerate Gotti Tedeschi, given he had nothing to do with the day-to-day functioning of the bank, but would likely seek indictments against Cipriani and Tulli, though the exact nature of the accusations against them remains unclear.

The Pope has hired Swiss-born anti-money laundering expert Rene Bruelhart to lead the Holy See's push for greater financial transparency.

Yesterday he was heading to Sun City, South Africa, for the annual meeting of the Egmont Group, a gathering of financial information agencies from 130 countries.

Despite
the news of the resignations the Holy See won coveted membership in the Egmont Group this 
week, joining a club that aims to share financial information in the 
global fight against money laundering and terror financing.

For
Bruelhart, dubbed the 'James Bond of the financial world' by some 
media, joining Egmont means that the Vatican now is part of a trusted 
'family' and has more help in combating financial crimes - even if it 
can't root them out entirely.

'With
this membership, we are a credible player in the international and 
global fight against money laundering and terror finance,' Bruelhart 
said in a telephone interview Thursday from Sun City. 'They trust us. 
That is very important.'

The Egmont Group, which was created 
in 1995, aims to smooth the exchange of information and improve 
cooperation among its members. Those members are the financial 
intelligence units of countries' central banks - the departments that 
collect and investigate reports of suspicious financial transactions.

Bruelhart
headed Liechtenstein's financial intelligence unit for eight years, and
led the Egmont Group for two before being tapped by the Vatican as a 
consultant last year. The Holy See eventually named him director of its 
own financial intelligence unit to oversee all its financial activities.
Then-Pope Benedict XVI created the Financial Intelligence Authority, or
AIF, in 2010 as part of the Vatican's push to comply with international
norms to fight money laundering.

The Vatican's newborn AIF was faulted on several fronts when it was evaluated last year by independent European inspectors, though a follow-up evaluation is scheduled for December.

Bruelhart has said that amended laws and regulations are in the works ahead of the December progress report, and that for now the Holy See was content to have passed the milestone with Egmont. Asked how Egmont could have cleared the Holy See when there are still clearly problems at the bank, Bruelhart stressed the Egmont evaluation criteria was transparent and formal, with on-site visits and evaluations of its legislative framework and regulations.

'No country in the world is 100 percent perfect,' he said. 'What's important is if something is happening, you have the competent authority and you have the tools and measures to take relevant action.'

The next step for Bruelhart is to ink
a bilateral agreement with Italy to share financial information - a 
critical step given that the Italians have been the harshest critics of 
the Vatican's murky financial dealings, convinced that people have used 
the IOR to shield money from Italian tax authorities. As it is, Italian 
prosecutors have various investigations under way targeting the Vatican 
bank and people who may have used it for less than holy ends.

'We've identified the countries which are of relevance and important for us, and amongst them is Italy,' Bruelhart said.
