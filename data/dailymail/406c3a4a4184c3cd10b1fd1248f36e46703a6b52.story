It might not look radical from the outside, but inside Land Rover’s latest concept car has a range of gadgets that would have even James Bond looking on in envy.

These include laser positioning sensors, gesture-controlled systems and an ‘invisible’ bonnet that allows the driver to 'see through' the car to the ground beneath.

But the most Q-like development in the Discovery Vision Concept is remote-control drive, which allows anyone to drive the vehicle ‘at very low speed while not actually seated inside it'.

Land Rover says this system could be used on and off-road, from coupling a trailer to spotting obstacles during extreme off-road driving.

The off-road remote operation function has been dubbed All-Terrain Progress Control and the company claims that it will be ‘semi-autonomous.’

Off-road exploring is further helped by something known as ‘Wade Aid’ which measures depth in patches of water to prevent the vehicle from getting stuck. 

The car has a huge boot and seating for up to seven, and doors that open with just the swipe of your hand

The system acts like an electronic periscope to project image from below the car onto the windscreen in front of the driver.

Cameras in the vehicle’s grille capture mobbing pictures of the state of the road or terrain immediately ahead.

This video image is then transmitted digitally to a Head-Up Display of the type already used on many luxury and executive cars to project sat-nav and speed  details onto the windscreen.

The virtual image of the ground is superimposed over the actual image of the bonnet. This allows the driver to look through the windscreen and apparently ‘see-through’ the front of the car.

The ‘see through’ bonnet meanwhile combines cameras in the grille and jet-fighter-style head-up display technology on the windscreen.

Although designed principally for those who want to better spot rocky terrain or deep crevices  when they take their 4X4s seriously off-road, it could even have some use in the urban jungle by allowing drivers to spot and avoid potholes lurking just out of sight.

The car will also be practical with a huge boot and seating for up to seven, with the arrangement operated by touchscreen.

Visibility is boosted with the use of day-like light of the laser headlamps which feature smart object tracking and beam-dipping to improve driver safety.

Land Rover is set to showcase the Discovery Vision at this week's New York Motor Show, with the car going on sale later next year.

The first car will be based on the current Range Rover Evoque and has an estimated starting price of around £30,000 ($50,100).

Gerry McGovern, design director and chief creative officer at Land Rover, said: ‘The Discovery Concept vehicle represents a Vision of our future family of leisure SUVs.

‘Its modern, relevant and compelling design is a significant shift from Discovery as we know it, while well considered practicality, configurability and Land Rover's capability seamlessly blend to create a highly desirable vehicle that connects on an emotional level.’

The new Discovery is the latest model announced by prolific Jaguar Land Rover, which is experiencing its greatest ever period.

Sales and profits are increasing thanks to models like the Range Rover Evoque and Jaguar F-Type.

The company is also investing billions in research and development and the hard work is paying off. Last year it delivered 425,000 vehicles, an increase of 19 per cent.
