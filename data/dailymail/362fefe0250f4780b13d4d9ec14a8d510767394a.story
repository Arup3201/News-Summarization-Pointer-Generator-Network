The Great War broke out on her 14th birthday and during the horrific conflict she would lose one of her beloved brothers.

But despite her tender years Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother was determined to play her own part in the First World War at her Scottish childhood home.

Glamis in Angus was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers and the then Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon would write letters for injured soldiers and run errands from the local shops for them.

After the death of her brother Fergus, which severely affected her mother Lady Strathmore, Lady Elizabeth took on even more care duties.

She even saved the castle from being burned down - more than fulfilling her mother's maxim that 'duty is the rent you pay for life.'

Now pictures of the future Queen Elizabeth playing her part in the First World War have gone on show at the only home she actually ever owned as part of a new exhibition.

Fittingly the exhibition at the Castle of Mey in Caithness show the photographs of the teenage Lady Elizabeth at war as part of a display with locals from the county she would later in life call her home.

Caring: After the death of her brother Fergus, which severely affected her mother Lady Strathmore, the then Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon took on even more care duties

The tiny island of Stroma in the Pentland Firth off Mey - where Prince Charles loves to paint - is remembered with extra poignancy.

At the turn of the century Stroma's population was just 375 and 31 men were sent to war. Six of those men died, including three lodgers in one house who had joined the Seaforth Highlanders.

By 1961 the population fell to just 12 and the last islanders left at the end of the following year.

The island is now owned by one of its former inhabitants, who uses it to graze the cattle and sheep which are now its only occupants.

But it is the images of a young Lady Elizabeth that in a way capture the spirit of an age where everybody - no matter who you were, or how old - contributed to the war effort.

They are also a revealing insight into the care and compassion of the future wife of George VI - whose stoicism and compassion would become an enduring symbol of the Second World War.

The exhibition - which has taken a year to put together - has been curated by Christine Shearer, whose father the late Reverend George Bell was for 21 years the Church of Scotland Minister at Canisbay where Queen Elizabeth worshipped for almost 50 years.

'The Queen Mother knew the pain of the First World War. Her elder brother, Fergus, an officer in the Black Watch Regiment, was killed in action at the Battle of Loos in 1915,' she said.

'Another brother, Michael, who they called Mikey, was reported missing in action two years later,' said Mrs Shearer.

'Three weeks later, the family discovered that he had been captured after being wounded and he remained a prisoner of war in Germany for the rest of the war.

The Castle of Mey is located in Caithness, on the north coast of Scotland, about six miles west of John o' Groats

'Glamis was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers, which Elizabeth helped to run.

'Though she was too young to serve as a nurse, she did assist her parents in their efforts to support the war. I found it very emotional and moving putting the exhibition together.

'It is is clear that the care and compassion that the Queen Mother had was in many ways forged during this period.'

As well as caring for the troops Lady Elizabeth also played a major part in the rescue of the castle's contents during a serious fire on 16 September 1916.

Two soldiers discovered a fire in a room under the castle roof. As they ran to raise the alarm, the first person they came across was Lady Elizabeth who kept calm and immediately telephoned both the local and Dundee fire brigades.

She then marshalled everyone to fight the fire, organising a chain to bring buckets of water from the river.

Later, with the fire raging above them, she organised the removal of the valuables out onto the lawn.

One of the soldiers she treated wrote in her autograph book that she was to be 'hung, drawn, & quartered... Hung in diamonds, drawn in a coach and four, and quartered in the best house in the land'.

The war began during a moment of happiness for the young Elizabeth. As she celebrated her 14th birthday on 4 August 1914 en route to a vaudeville show in London the streets suddenly filled with people, cheering and waving flags.

Then, at the end of the show, the theatre manager came onto the stage to announce that war had been declared on Germany that very evening.

Soon after, Lady Elizabeth, her mother and her sister Lady Rose, returned to Glamis where the castle was converted to a convalescent home for wounded soldiers.

'She immersed herself in their care and welfare. This was to be her role throughout the war and her kindness won the admiration of many of the soldiers who passed through Glamis,' said Mrs Shearer.

'She even did not want the furniture moved about too much because she wanted the men to feel that they were at home. She would run errands, including getting their tobacco from the local shop.

'But after the death of Fergus she took on more duties because her mother was so distraught.

'The mental scars of those who fought and survived must have been terrible. I think the whole experience of the First World War affected Elizabeth greatly. Four of her brothers served in the army.

'Her compassion and kindness was something that stayed with her all her life. She was an incredible and remarkable lady.'

In 1918 the armistice signalled the end of the war and the end of an era. Once the last soldier had left Glamis in 1919 Lady Elizabeth was launched into the high society of the day at her coming out party.

While at a ball in London, Lady Elizabeth caught the eye of Prince Albert once again when he saw her dancing with his equerry James Stuart.

Lady Elizabeth later refused his first two proposals and after accepting the third, a delighted prince sent a telegraph to his parents that simply said 'Alright - Bertie.' They married in April 1923.

The exhibition is being staged in the chauffeur's cottage at the Castle of Mey.

Having acquired the most northerly castle on the British mainland, Queen Elizabeth renovated and restored it and also created beautiful walled gardens.

Queen Elizabeth first saw what was then Barrogill Castle in 1952, while mourning the death of her husband, King George VI.

Falling for its ruined isolated charm, and hearing it was to be abandoned, she declared: 'Never! It's part of Scotland's heritage. I'll save it.'

With the encouragement of Prince Charles, two new 'E' shaped rose beds have been created in the walled garden - a fitting memorial to his grandmother's love of roses.

The castle is closed for the week while Charles is in residence - an annual stay he started after his beloved grandmother died aged 101 in 2002.
