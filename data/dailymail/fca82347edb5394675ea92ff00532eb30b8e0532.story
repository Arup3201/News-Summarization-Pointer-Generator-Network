A new device that sends a high-frequency electrical pulse through the spine could revolutionise the treatment of severe back pain, according to a new study.

A team at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, London, is the first in the world to implant the Senza spinal cord stimulator in 100 patients who would otherwise need surgery to stop their back pain.

The device is less invasive than surgery and cheaper. Senza therapy uses frequency 200 times higher than current spinal cord stimulation therapy.

Dr Adnan Al-Kaisy, consultant in pain management, who led the Senza study, said: ‘This new high-frequency version goes beyond what previous devices could do to give immediate pain relief without any tingling.

‘And we used to have to talk to the patient in the middle of the operation to make sure where they were feeling the tingling sensations. With the Senza device, they can sleep.’

Patients have a wire, connected to a battery pack, inserted into their epidural space. If the electrical current that is emitted stops their pain, they will have this wire removed and replaced by the full Senza implant.

The £15,000 implant is switched on using a remote control. At typical settings, patients can use it for at least a day to a few days at a time.

‘Patients have no idea whether other kinds of surgery will work, whereas with the Senza they know what to expect,’ says Dr  Al-Kaisy. ‘We give them a trial of the device before going ahead with a permanent implant.’

The procedure will not work for everyone, however. One in three won’t be suitable because previous surgeries have complicated their condition, or their pain is too widespread.

Clinical data from a recent European clinical trial shows that the majority of patients (88%) have a successful result.

Patients accepted for a trial of the device are also required to undergo a residential course at Guy’s and St Thomas’, which involves cognitive behaviour therapy, relaxation and learning to reduce their pain medication.

‘The sky is the limit as to how many patients we could treat every year, so long as we have the resources and access to an operating theatre,’ says Dr Al-Kaisy.
