All eyes may be on the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe choice today as she visits a primary school in London but another royal family member is quietly holding her own in the fashion stakes.

It seems that with each public appearance she attends, Princess Beatrice pushes the style boundaries further and further.

The young royal looked on-trend in a colourful boxy A-line skirt and white blouse as she attended The Masterpiece Marie Curie Party event in London last night.

The event, which was supported by Jaeger-LeCoultre and hosted by Heather Kerzner, took place at The Royal Hospital Chelsea.
