A driver narrowly escaped death after a lorry lost control on a bend, rolled over and crashed into his vehicle in an incident caught on camera.

Amazingly both drivers got out of their vehicles uninjured after the crash which happened on a winding mountain road in Russia.

As the SUV approaches a sharp left-hand bend, the lorry topples onto its side as it comes round the corner. The out of control truck then slams into the approaching vehicle.

Topple: There doesn't appear to be a problem as the lorry comes round the corner - but suddenly the back end sticks out and falls over

The incident was caught on camera and uploaded to YouTube because the vehicle was fitted with an on board camera.

Just seconds after the crash, the driver of the toppled lorry can be seen standing up inside the cab calmly trying to break his windscreen to escape.
