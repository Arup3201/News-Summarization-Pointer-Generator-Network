Choking smog engulfed one of northeastern China's largest cities last week, causing Chinese authorities to shut down the city.

The incredible amounts of smog in Harbin - a city of more than 10 million people – meant that visibility was reduced to less than 10 metres.  

The smog forced schools to suspend classes, caused snarling traffic and closed the airport, in what was the country's first major air pollution crisis of the winter.

The heavy smog is caused by industrial pollution, coal and agricultural burning, and has been trapped by the mountains to the west and wind patterns. The thick haze of smog is clearly visible as the murky grey colour in this VIIRS image from the Suomi NPP satellite

Now, the latest satellite images from Nasa’s Suomi-NPP satellite show the startling extend of China’s smog problem.

Measurements taken on October 20, 2013, scored the air quality index (AQI) in the city at 500, the highest possible reading. Levels above 300 are considered hazardous to human health.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite acquired a natural-colour image of northeastern China on October 21, 2013.

The brightest areas in this image are fog, which has a tinge of grey or yellow due to the air pollution. Other cloud-free areas have a pall of grey and brown smog that blots out the city and surrounding towns

Some neighborhoods experienced concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as high as 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter.

For comparison, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality standards say PM2.5 should remain below 35 micrograms per cubic meter.

Beijing, Tianjin, and Harbin are located on China's coastal plains, to the east of mountain ranges and land at higher elevations

It is extremely rare for particulate levels to reach that high in the absence of a dust storm or forest fire.

A few days after pollution levels started to rise, Harbin hospitals reported a 30 per cent increase in admissions related to respiratory problems, and several Harbin pharmacies were sold out of pollution facemasks, according to media reports.

Cold weather and the lack of wind helped fuel the pollution outbreak, but human factors also played an important role. Wheat and corn farmers in the region light fires in the fall to burn off debris following the harvest.

Air quality in Chinese cities is of increasing concern to China's stability-obsessed leadership because it plays into popular resentment over political privilege and rising inequality in the world's second-largest economy.

Domestic media have run stories describing the expensive air purifiers government officials enjoy in their homes and offices, alongside reports of special organic farms so cadres need not risk suffering from recurring food safety scandals.

The government has announced plans over the years to tackle the pollution problem but has made little apparent progress.
