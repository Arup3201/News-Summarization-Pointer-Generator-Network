He may be just one day into his new job but Pope Francis has already undergone a subtle makeover.

Jorge Mario Bergoglio was seen yesterday wearing glasses as he was announced to the tens of thousands of Catholics who flocked to Vatican City.

But this morning, the Argentine was pictured smiling from the steps of the Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica in Rome minus his spectacles.

The new Pope has a reputation for being serious and there has previously been an email campaign  when he was the provincial of the order in Argentina that asserted 'he never smiled'.

However, as Pope Francis entered the St Mary Major basilica this morning he smiled and waved warmly to the crowds.

In the coming days Pope Francis will be decked out in the regulation outfit of every pontiff.

The 76-year-old's current papal outfit is an off-the-peg dress and cassock chosen from one of three vestments laid out yesterday.

The Gammarelli tailors, who have dressed seven of the holy pontiff over two centuries, had prepared three sets of outfits, in small, medium and large, ready for a new pope of any size.

The clothes were left in a room next to the Sistine Chapel known as the 'Room of Tears'.

A made-to-measure outfit will now be made for Francis I and takes up to three days.

The new Pope's outfit will consist of a
skirt of ivory wool, a white cassock with sleeves and 33 
buttons that symbolise Christ's age.

He will also wear the white skullcap, a pair of red 
leather shoes and a 'mozzetta', which is worn over the shoulders.

Six pairs of the red shoes - the 
colour to represent the blood of martyrs - famously worn by retired Pope
Benedict XVI were also crafted in advance.

The costs of the papal clothes is not made public.

Gammarell, founded in 1798 Via Santa Chiara, a stone's
throw from the Pantheon, in Rome, Italy, are known as the 'santari' or 
ecclesiastical tailors and work exclusively for the Pope and thousands of priests.

Filippo Gammarelli said: 'The model 
has remained the same as that mandated by Pius IX, more than one hundred
and fifty years ago, and since then all we pack for the Popes responds 
to these canons, albeit with some license imposed by the various 
flavours of the Popes.

'To Pope Luciani - John Paul I - for 
example, we had to replace the white dress immediately after his 
elections, because it was wet with tears of his emotion.

'Blessed Pope John Paul II, instead, 
was used to ask for light clothing and without sleeves, because he was a
strong, warm, and "sports" man.

'It would be disrespectful to reveal 
the detail of the costs. Ours is a very specialised craft work, but I 
can assure you that the prices are not excessive as it was led to 
believe.

'We like to think that we sew the fabric and make the dress, God instead makes the Pope.'

Francis I also has his own Papal ring - the Ring of the Fisherman - that is worn on the third finger of his right hand.

The ring is cast in gold for each Pope and bears the image of St Peter in a boat.

Pope Francis will now ditch his Cardinal's robes for the red and white uniform of the pontiff.

The official papal wardrobe consists of various mozzettas (short capes), rochets, which are worn over the cassock, and stoles in red and white and some trimmed with ermine and gold embroidery.

They are worn with the white cassock and the white zucchetto or skullcap and red or white shoes.

The colours symbolise the innocence and sacrifice of Christ.

Tradition dictates that the stole and shoes should always match the colour of the mozzetta but individual Popes can go against the grain.

Pope Benedict chose to wear the red shoes in public, even if he was not wearing the red stole.

He also reintroduced the red wide-brimmed straw hat to the Papal wardrobe, according to Catholic News.

According to the website, protocol dictates in which combination the clothes are worn depending on who the Pope is meeting.

When the Pope meets a Catholic head of state he wears the rochet, mozzetta and a stole, but no stole if the head of state if not Catholic.
