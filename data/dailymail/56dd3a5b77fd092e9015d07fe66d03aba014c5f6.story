When Shelley Lamond lost her daughter Mabel to stillbirth in May last year she wasn't ready to say goodbye straight away.

The hospital in Adelaide where she had her baby provided her with a 'cuddle cot' - piece of medical equipment that acts like a refrigerated bassinet and allows babies to stay in the room with their parents so they do not need to be taken straight to the morgue.

Mrs Lamond, 39, and her husband Rick found the extra 48 hours they got to spend with Mabel so precious that they wanted to raise money to buy another one for other mothers to use.

Almost a year after Mabel's death she was four months pregnant again and had just donated a cuddle cot to a local charity when the unthinkable happened – she had another stillbirth.

'They had the cot there, I just never expected I'd be the first one to use it,' Mrs Lamond told Daily Mail Australia.

Her waters broke early and on May 16 of this year her daughter Elsa was stillborn – 18 weeks and three days into the pregnancy.

Mrs Lamond, who lives on a farm 112km north of Adelaide, said using a cuddle cot to buy extra time with Mabel and Elsa allowed her to say goodbye in a way she felt comfortable.

'That's the only time you get to spend with these precious babies,' she said.

'They're the only memories you're ever going to have with them.'

Mrs Lamond knows how traumatic it is to have to say goodbye without a cuddle cot, because she has suffered four stillbirths in total.

Mrs Lamond donated this comfort cot to a local charity after Mabel's death and tragically was the first one to use it when she suffered another miscarriage in May this year - losing daughter Elsa at 18 weeks

Before her first stillbirth she had given birth to three children – Tyson, now 14, Chloe, 12 and Stella, 4.

But during her fourth pregnancy her waters broke early and baby Matilda was delivered stillborn on December 11 2009.

Since then she has suffered three more still births – Pearl in June 2012, Mable in 2013 and Elsa this year. Doctors have not been able to work out why.

'In the scenario where you haven't got a cuddle cot you have to buzz the nurse if you want to see your baby and they've then got to go get her [from the morgue],' she said.

'And then to see them walk in with a canvas bag and unzip a bag and your baby's lying in there.

'When I think back to that experience that was just awful seeing my baby in a green canvas bag.'

Mrs Lamond said many people – even mothers who have stillbirths - don't know about cuddle cots because it's such a painful subject.

'It does make people feel uncomfortable, the death of a child, because it's really not the natural order of things,' she said.

'Other people haven't met that baby, only the parents, so they haven't made that connection.

'It's almost like it's not a real death. But it is.'

Stillbirth Foundation Australia CEO Jan Samuels said cuddle cots were uncommon, because they cost about $5000 and were not priority equipment for hospitals.

'It's usually that mothers [who have had a stillbirth] want to buy one and donate to their local hospital,' Ms Samuels told Daily Mail Australia.

'But parents who have the opportunity to have them say it's important to be able to spend that time with the child.'

In Australia six babies are stillborn every day. Stillbirth affects 2200 families per year and occurs in one in every 135 births.

'It's huge, and in around 40 percent of cases they never find out the cause,' Ms Samuels said.

Mrs Lamond is currently fundraising to donate a second cuddle cot to charity Pregnancy Loss Australia, and is $700 away from her target.

Joanne Stephenson, 34, is also currently trying to raise money to donate a cuddle cot to her local hospital.

Mrs Stephenson, who lives in Woolooware in south Sydney with her husband Ross and three-year-old son Brodie, lost her daughter Amelia to stillbirth in August last year.

She didn't have access to a cuddle cot and had never heard of them at the time, and so she got to spend just seven hours with Amelia before saying goodbye.

'I wrote a poem which I read to her over and over,' Mrs Stephenson told Daily Mail Australia.

'We bathed her, I dressed her. We really just cuddled her and just held her.

'That seven hours sounds like a long time but it just goes so quickly.'

Afterwards her work colleagues helped her raise $8000 to donate to stillbirth charities, and she was researching ways to use the money when she came across cuddle cots.

Mrs Stephenson said if she had had access to one the whole experience would have been very different.

'It definitely would have changed things because she would have been more real to my family and friends,' she said.

'No one got to meet her except me and my husband.

'Sometimes we feel uncomfortable, like people think she didn't exist so we should just get over it.'

Earlier this year she donated one cuddle cot to Sutherland Hospital with the money her work had raised, and since then she has been contacted by a number of mothers thanking her for enabling them to use it.

'One mother got to spend 36 hours with their baby, which is five times the amount of time that we got,' she said.

Mrs Stephenson is now 39 weeks pregnant and is due to give birth on Monday.

She said it has been difficult emotionally given the trauma of losing Amelia.

'It was quite hard to even think forward and think ahead and try to be positive,' she said.

'I didn't even tell anybody for ages, I just didn't feel comfortable with people getting excited for me when I wasn't excited myself.'

But after marking what would have been Amelia's first birthday last Friday, Mrs Stephenson feels like she is ready.

'I feel better, I feel really good at the moment,' she said.

'Getting through Amelia's first anniversary, that was a milestone.'
