BBC Scotland newsreader Sally Magnusson had an on-air meltdown yesterday after the lunchtime news bulletin descended into chaos.

A series of technical hitches hit Reporting Scotland’s afternoon programme leaving the experienced presenter in a flap.

Her nightmare began when a live link to reporter Phil Goodlad at the Open Golf championship at Muirfield broke midway through.

Something is amiss: The news reader awkwardly shuffles her notes after technical hitches start to plague the show

Newsreader Sally Magnusson was left without any information and news segments that were meant to play failed to materialise. She began to look embarrassed about the blunders

Then a pre-recorded report about an exhibition by artist Ken Currie wouldn’t start.

Sally went on to introduce a story about new Andy Murray stamps to celebrate his Wimbledon victory.

However the screen then flashed to stills of Ken Currie and his new exhibition.

Magnusson, 57, struggled to contain her composure and burst into laughter as production workers scrambled to fix the blunders.

Pressure: The experienced newsreader shakes her fists at the frustrating delays

Blowing her top: Magnusson shouts at the end of the broadcast as it all gets too much. But viewers felt she handled the situation with good humour

She told viewers: 'Oh, it’s a wee bit of a dog’s breakfast.

'I do apologise. Let me wait for instructions. I think we are going to go....

'They’re having a little argument behind me. They’ll tell me what they want me to do.'

The exasperated host’s autocue also seemed to be playing up and at the end of the five-minute bulletin, she threw her hands in the air and let out a scream.

Twitter user Tom Leslie said: 'Tom Leslie added: 'Poor Sally Magnusson - she coped well with the lunchtime Reporting Scotland falling apart'

However, she won sympathy from viewers for her handling of the situation

On Twitter, James Christie wrote: 'Sally Magnusson on BBC Scotland just showed why it’s useful to have an experienced anchor when the news disintegrates into technical chaos.'

Pamela Dobbie posted: 'Hilarious lunchtime #reportingscotland...think #sallymagnusson will be killing somebody in editorial around now!'

Tom Leslie added: 'Poor Sally Magnusson - she coped well with the lunchtime Reporting Scotland falling apart.'

Sally, the daughter of the late Mastermind host Magnus Magnusson, began her broadcasting career on BBC’s Breakfast Time in the 1980s.

Today's comedy of errors is not the first time technical problems have hit Reporting Scotland.

In 2011, presenter Catriona Shearer introduced the weather report - and footage of Adolf Hitler’s deputy Rudolf Hess ranting at a Nazi rally popped up instead.

That fiasco followed a piece about the 70th anniversary of Rudolf Hess’ landing in Scotland, which showed a picture of the Scots Christian missionary Mary Gardner, killed in a Jerusalem bomb blast in March.

And in 2008, BBC workers were warned about making for obscene gestures behind newsreaders’ backs on air.

Beeb bosses took action after eagle-eyed viewers started complaining about seeing staff pulling dodgy hand signals during Reporting Scotland trailers.
