A Philadelphia student who was bullied by two classmates died Sunday after the attack apparently made him suffer from seizures.

Bailey O'Neill had been in hospital in a medically induced coma for weeks as doctors battled to save his life.

But he passed away yesterday, the day after his 12th birthday, with his family paying tribute to 'the strongest toughest boy'.

His death prompted an emotional outburst from Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice, who vowed to transform the tragedy into an opportunity to do good by cracking down on bullying.

Tragic: Bailey O'Neill has died aged 12 after apparently being targeted by bullies at school

Champion: Bailey's family have spoken of his love of baseball as they paid tribute to the fun-loving youngster

Bailey was attacked by two other boys during recess at his school in a suburb of Philadelphia in January, his family told NBC Philadelphia.

He suffered from a broken nose and a concussion, but his family started to have serious worries after his condition deteriorated over the following two weeks.

The youngster was taken to hospital in Wilmington, Delaware with dehydration and vomiting, and overnight he began to have a seizure.

Doctors induced a coma in an attempt to stop the seizures, but his condition did not improve.

Further complications ensued after Bailey fell victim to pneumonia and had to have a blood transfusion.

Fan: Bailey, who lived in a suburb of Philadelphia, was a keen sportsman

He turned 12 on Saturday, but the next day he finally succumbed to his various medical conditions and died.

A relative who set up a Facebook page in support of Bailey wrote yesterday: 'I would like to thank everyone who has prayed and supported Bailey and his family!!

'Bailey has been the strongest toughest boy I know. He has fought this battle long and hard. There just wasn't a way to fix this.

'I wish I could say he will get better but I can't. Bailey has gone to be with God today.'

Family members have previously said they are keen to see the two alleged bullies forced to account for their actions.

'I would like to see these kids punished,' Bailey's grandmother Joy Fecanin told NBC before her grandson's death. 'Something has to be done. I don't know what's taking them so long.'

The boys were suspended from Darby Township School for two days, but it is unclear whether or not they will face any further action.

Investigators have interviewed pupils who witnessed the fight in an attempt to discover whether the incident was responsible for Bailey's illness and death.

His family has withdrawn his younger brother from school, fearing that he too might become a target for bullies.

In a statement issued before Bailey's death, school superintendent Stephen Butz issued a statement saying: 'We have requested that the local police assist us in the investigation of this incident and are fully cooperating with their investigation of this incident.'

After it was announced that the 12-year-old had died, star running back Mr Rice took to Facebook to speak of his grief and call for action on classroom bullying.

'I don't think I will ever be able to understand why kids bully each other and how we are all sitting here after yet another "bully death" getting ready to go through this difficult task of picking up the pieces and the even more difficult task of forgiving so we can heal,' the 26-year-old wrote.

'I don't know if we will ever get to a point where bullying is actually considered a CRIME, rather than "kids being kids" or a "playground incident."

'I don't know if the kid that did this to Bailey will be punished severely enough or if he will receive the help I know he truly needs. Bullying doesn't happen for no reason... we have to figure out what the underlying cause it and treat it like the illness it is.

'Bailey - my little buddy, I will not let you become just another bully statistic...you are my inspiration and one more angel that will help me continue the fight for kids everywhere. 'You are going to help me save lives. RIP my little friend.'
