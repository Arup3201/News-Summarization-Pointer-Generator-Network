Police have charged Daniel Jack Kelsall, 21, with breaking into Mr Huxley's apartment on Sydney's North Shore with the intention of indecently assaulting him, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

The new charge against Kelsall, who is facing a murder trial later this year, was tendered on Thursday in Central Local Court, Sydney.

Assaulted before he was killed: Police now say murder victim Morgan Huxley (above) was indecently assaulted in his flat before he was stabbed to death 28 times

Mr Huxley, 31, was discovered by his flatmate naked from the waist down and barely alive in the early house of September 8 last year.

Police said he appeared to have been the victim of a stabbing frenzy and at first said a woman may have been his killer.

Mr Huxley, who ran his own pontoon building business, had spent his last day at an engagement party and was seen at his local hotel, the Oaks, around 1.30am.

Detectives later studied security footage of a street near his flat and found footage of him at an intersection in conversation with man wearing chef's trousers.

A month later, detectives arrested Kelsall and charged him with murder. they later added two more charges of possessing child abuse images on his laptop computer.

Kelsall is due in court again next month.
