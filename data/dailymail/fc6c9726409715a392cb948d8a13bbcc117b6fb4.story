To his neighbours in a quiet suburb of Cambridge, he was an ordinary computer programmer who enjoyed playing squash at the weekends.

But yesterday friends of the man they knew as Cyril Macq were stunned after he was unmasked as Spain’s most wanted terror suspect – accused of attempting to assassinate the King of Spain with a grenade launcher.

Eneko Gogeaskoetxea Arronategui, 44, was arrested in a dramatic early morning raid by armed police from Scotland Yard’s extradition unit and Cambridgeshire Police.

Neighbours in the Arbury area  woke 
up to the sound of officers bursting into his modest three-bedroom 
terraced house as helicopters hovered above the property where he has 
been hiding for at least five years with his wife and their two 
children.

The alleged assassin from the Basque separatist group Eta is accused of plotting to assassinate Spain’s King Juan Carlos.

During the botched grenade attack in 
Bilbao in October 1997, a police officer was killed at the Guggenheim 
Museum, after which Arronategui allegedly hijacked three cars to escape.

Police allege that Eneko Gogeaskoetxea Arronategui, left, was part of an assassination attempt against King Juan Carlos in October 1997 

Yesterday it emerged that the 
suspected terrorist, born in Guernica, had led an extraordinary double 
life, pretending to be a French national on the  council estate in 
Cambridge.

Using the name Cyril Macq, he got a 
job as an IT programmer for Webworks, which provides IT support to 
online retailer Play.com in an industrial estate on the outskirts of the
city.

He quickly made friends in the community and became a respected member of the Cambridge Squash Club.

Shocked neighbours described the terror suspect as ‘quiet and polite’ and ‘a regular dad’.

The Spanish interior ministry said 
police were tipped off to his Cambridge address after a Spanish national
spotted him at a sports club nearby.

Yesterday Arronategui appeared before City of Westminster magistrates.

He refused to agree to being extradited to Spain and was remanded in custody until the next hearing on July 25.

Yesterday Steve Casey, chairman of the Cambridge Squash Club said: ‘Cyril has been the membership secretary at our squash club for seven years. He's a great guy and a great secretary at the club.

‘I'm blown away by the news - I'm really staggered.'

Treasurer of the club, Bernie Yates, 61, added: ‘He is a very amiable chap and very popular within the club. We are all absolutely gobsmacked by the news.’

Mr Arronategi is alleged to have been involved in a plot to bomb the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao in October 1997 as Juan Carlos opened it, before fleeing the country

Arronategui faces further charges of possession of ammunition, three charges for theft of vehicles and one of forgery.

During the botched assassination attempt, a police officer was killed in the Guggenheim Gardens, after which Arronategui allegedly hijacked three cars to escape.

The plot was foiled when police asked two men disguised as gardeners to identify themselves.

James Stansfeld, for the extradition authorities said: 'The requested person was stopped while he was in the Guggenheim gardens filling window boxes with ammunition and grenade launchers’.

'To effect his escape the officer who stopped him was shot and killed.

'In order to effect his escape throughout the city, he hijacked three cars to evade capture.'

Mr Stansfeld added: ‘His involvement with the Eta terrorist organisation, which is an established terrorist organisation, could provide him with the means and indeed contacts to hide from the authorities in this jurisdiction and not cooperate with proceedings.’
