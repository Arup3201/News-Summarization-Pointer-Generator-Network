A family have told how their car was surrounded by royal protection officers after they broke down near the Duchess of Cambridge's parents' home - before they went on to have a brush with Kate herself.

Adam De Marco, 40, his partner Claire Lennon, 39, and their daughter Mia, seven, were on a family day out in Bucklebury, near Newbury, Berkshire, when their BMW sprung a puncture.

Their stricken vehicle quickly attracted the attention of royal minders, who ordered them out of the car, they said.

The family were heading for Bucklebury Farm Park, not far from the Â£7 million home of the Duchess of Cambridge's parents Michael and Carole Middleton.

Kate, who is 14 weeks pregnant, is staying at the closely-guarded mansion with Prince William and baby Prince George while she battles severe morning sickness.

Spotting Mr De Marco's car apparently parked so close to the house, armed royal protection officers were quick to intervene.

But the specialist police officers put away their guns and offered to help the family after realising what had happened.

The family later spotted Kate, her mother Carole and Prince George at the nearby farm.

Mr De Marco, director of a print company in Andover, Hampshire, said: 'We got the flat tyre as we drove Mia to the farm park, where children can play on the swings and look at the animals.'

He added: 'I went to put on the spare, but then realised I was missing the special screw-nut you need with a BMW to remove the wheel - it's meant to stop thieves.

'I was in a quandary, wondering what to do...then all of a sudden we found ourselves surrounded by policemen who were carrying guns.

'I didn't twig at first that they were connected with the royal family, but one of them mentioned Prince William and the Middletons' house nearby and we put two and two together.

'Once they realised we were not terrorists, they relaxed and offered to help.

'They even drove off to visit a couple of garages in the area to see if anyone had a spare screw-nut so we could change the flat tyre.'

'Unfortunately they came back empty-handed and said nobody had one, so we had to phone the RAC who arrived to changed the wheel.'

He added: 'By that time it was too late to go to the park. Mia was a bit disappointed because she'd been looking forward to it, so we went back the next day.

The village of Bucklebury has often seen royal guards move in when Kate and Wills visit her parents

'And while we were there, we saw Kate, her mum and Prince George at the farm shop, where you can buy fresh meat and other food.

'When they got into their Range Rover to drive off, we took some photos.'

The Duchess of Cambridge made her first public appearance since announcing she is pregnant with her second child last week.

She rode in a carriage procession to Buckingham Palace as part of the state visit by the president of Singapore. She was later seen visiting a charity event in London.
