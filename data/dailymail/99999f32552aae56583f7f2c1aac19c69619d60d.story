Prospective jurors in the trial of the business partner of Maine's alleged 'Zumba prostitute' are being forced to answer personal questions about their views on sex and prostitution in open court.

The questionnaire for potential members of the jury includes questions like, 'Do you have a personal or religious aversion to pornography?'; 'Are you of the opinion that prostitution should be legal?' and 'You may be shown explicit videos and photographs depicting individuals engaged in graphic sexual acts. Would viewing this evidence make it difficult for you to listen to?'

On Friday, the judge in the case dismissed 46 of the 59 charges against Mark W. Strong, 59, who is accused of promoting prostitution and helping Zumba instructor Alexis Wright run a lucrative prostitution business out of her Zumba exercise studio in Kennebunk, Maine.

Still on the hook: Mark Strong, right, is seen outside court with his lawyer Dan Lilley, left, last week. Strong still faces 13 counts of promoting prostitution

Sexually-charged: The prostitution charges against Alexis Wright, 30, and her business partner, Strong, have led lawyers to ask potential jurors numerous prying questions about their views on sex

Strong and Wright were both charged with invasion of privacy for allegedly videotaping Wright's encounters with the men who were paying her for sex.

York County Superior Court Justice Nancy Mills ruled that the johns had no expectation of privacy when they  arrived at Wright's studio, allegedly intent on committing the crime of soliciting prostitution, the Portsmouth Herald reports.

Wright's lawyer says she will fight to have the the invasion of privacy charge against her tossed, as well.

However prosecutors have appealed the ruling to the Maine Supreme Justice Court, hoping to have the charges reinstated.

Strong still faces 13 counts of promoting prostitution - all misdemeanors.

Strong has admitted to having an affair with Wright, 30, and said he gave her a loan to fund her exercise studio. However, he denies that he knew about her alleged prostitution business or helped her promote it.

Tossed: Justice Nancy Mills threw out the invasion of privacy charges against Strong, saying the johns who were allegedly videotaped by Wright had no expectation of privacy if they visited a prostitute

His lawyers say overzealous prosecutors and police have wasted valuable time and money to 'persecute' their client.

The week the state supreme court also ruled that jury selection must be open to the public after the Portland Press-Herald sued, saying the media and the public should not have been barred from the proceedings.

Now, prospective jurors in the close-night community must talk about their feelings about sex and sexuality in open court.

Questions from a confidential jury selection sheet include:

'Trumped up': Strong's lawyers argue that the state has spent an inordinate amount of time and money prosecuting the Kennebunk businessman and relatively minor charges

The Boston Herald speculates that lawyers might ask even more personal questions when they interrogate the jury pool - asking about domination fetishes and other sexual proclivities involved in the prostitution case. 

Prosecutors and Justice Mills argued that opening jury selection up to public scrutiny will make it even more difficult to find impartial jurors for the case that gained international attention and rocked the small Maine community.

Are you of the opinion that prostitution should be legal in the State of Maine?

@highlight

Do you have a personal or religious aversion to pornography that would make it difficultto listen to the law and evidence and render a fair and impartial verdict?

You may be shown explicit videos and photographs depicting individuals engaged ingraphic sexual acts. Would viewing this evidence make it difficult for you to listen to thelaw and evidence and render a fair and impartial verdict?

Adultery is defined as having sex with another person who is not your spouse; it is not acrime. Prostitution is defined as having or offering to have sex with another person formoney. If the evidence shows that Defendant Mark Strong committed adultery withAlexis Wright, would that fact alone make it difficult for you to find him not guilty of thecrime of Promotion of Prostitution?
