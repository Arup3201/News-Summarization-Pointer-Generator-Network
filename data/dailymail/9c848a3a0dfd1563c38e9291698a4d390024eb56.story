Victim: Ron Torncello, pictured, was punched after a man allegedly became upset that Torncello had been talking on his cell phone while driving through a parking lot

'I thought anything that could catch the guy [...] I would support,' Torncello told KGTV. 'This guy needs to be put away.'

Torncello told the station the attack happened after the man approached him and yelled at him for driving and talking on his cell phone at the same time.

The man was 'screaming in the window, with his cell phone, saying "You were talking on your phone, you were on your cell phone,"' Torncello told KGTV.

At the time of the April 30 
assault, police described the suspect in a press release as 'a White male adult,
 at least 6â€™0 tall with a muscular build' who 'was wearing dark shorts, a
 white t-shirt, and a light colored baseball hat with the letters UFC on
 the front.'

Severe: Police said Torncello's injuries required two surgeries

Attack: The suspect can be seen punching Torncello in surveillance video released by authorities

Torncello told KGTV that a man 'got between me and the guy he started to chew this guy out, and kind of chased him off.'

'Eye socket bones were broken. They had to take skin and rebuild my eye lid. I'm in constant pain,' Torncello told KGTV of his injuries.

Authorities said Torncello 'suffered major injuries which have required two facial reconstructive surgeries' in a June 18 statement.
