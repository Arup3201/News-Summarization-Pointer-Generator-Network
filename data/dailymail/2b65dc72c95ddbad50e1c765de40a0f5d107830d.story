Cancer-survivor Jonas Gutierrez made an emotional return to St James' Park during Wednesday night's 1-0 defeat to Manchester United.

The 31-year-old has twice beaten testicular cancer and only returned to the club after being given the all-clear following chemotherapy in November.

He has since been building fitness with the Under-21s and was named on the bench for the first time last weekend.

But Gutierrez finally made his first appearance in black and white in 17 months when he emerged midway through the second half as replacement for Ryan Taylor.

St James' stood as one to welcome the fan favourite and close friend Fabricio Coloccini immediately handed the captain's armband to his Argentinian comrade.

Gutierrez was booked soon after for a chop on Adnan Januzaj, but looked sharp with his every touch cheered by the Toon Army.

And Newcastle head coach John Carver praised the substitute's impact, 'Maybe I should have started him!' 

'The crowd came alive. He's worked tirelessly and it showed what the fans think of him – the roof nearly came off the stadium.'

Newcastle, though, were beaten by Ashley Young's close-range strike in the dying seconds of what had been a feisty encounter.

The 31-year-old received a standing ovation from the St James' Park crowd in an emotional display
