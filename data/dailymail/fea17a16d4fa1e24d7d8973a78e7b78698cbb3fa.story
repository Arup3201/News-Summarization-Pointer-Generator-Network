Top notch: Heston Blumenthal's restaurant Dinner ranks highly

He may have been a little disappointed to see one of his restaurants fall out of the global top ten.

But there was plenty to take Heston Blumenthal’s mind off it yesterday – as two of his eateries were ranked among the best 15 in the world.

Blumenthal’s newest venture, Dinner, took ninth place in the chart, becoming the top ranking UK restaurant and the highest new entry.

Judges praised the Knightsbridge 
restaurant for providing ‘the reworking of historical British recipes 
from as far back as the 14th century’.

They added: ‘Diners can revel in the 
mandarin-tinged, super-smooth creamy chicken liver parfait of the meat 
fruit or the sweet fluffy indulgence of the Sauternes-soaked tipsy 
cake.’

A three-course set lunch menu at Dinner costs £32, and its most expensive main course is a fillet of Aberdeen Angus for £38.

The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, slipped out of the top ten but took 13th place.

At Blumenthal’s Michelin-starred restaurant, which secured fifth place last year, a three-hour tasting menu featuring such delicacies as snail porridge and powdered duck costs £180 per head.

Blumenthal’s position as Britain’s top celebrity chef was cemented in the annual list of the world’s 50 best restaurants, revealed last night.

Compiled by Restaurant magazine, the prestigious awards are judged by a panel of more than 800 chefs, restaurateurs, journalists and food experts.

Australian chef Brett Graham’s restaurant Ledbury, in Notting Hill, also made it into the top 15, leaping 20 places to number 14 – the greatest climb by any restaurant in the chart.

‘Service standards are exceptional,’ judges said. ‘Graham’s low-key, refined techniques are original, but not overtly avant-garde.’

Fine dining: No 1 restaurant Noma including musk ox and smoked marrow and sea urchin with dill

For the third consecutive year, the title of world’s best restaurant went to Noma in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Chef Rene Redzepi receives thousands of reservation requests a day for his extravagant Nordic menu featuring dishes such as musk ox and smoked marrow, sea urchin and dill or beef cheek and pear.

The chefs’ choice award went to Andoni Luis Aduriz of Mugaritz in San Sebastian, Spain.

Despite being devastated by a fire two years ago, the restaurant held on to third place in the chart.
