Dries Mertens has given an encouraging thumbs up after the Belgium forward was knocked out cold in his side's clash with Wales on Sunday.

Mertens came off worse in a horrific clash of heads with George Williams during Belgium's 0-0 Euro 2016 qualifying draw with Wales at the King Baudouin Stadium, leading to the forward being left out cold and carried off on a stretcher with five minutes to play.

The Napoli star was stricken on the turf for close to five minutes as he received treatment and there were fears over his immediate health after he was carried down the tunnel.

But the 27-year-old helped eased concerns later in the evening  as he took to Twitter, posting a picture of himself giving a thumbs up from his nursing bed and adding the words 'I'm oke! Thanks for the support...'

Mertens had suffered a concussion following the incident and will now remain in hospital for 24 hours.

Williams tweeted his delight at knowing Mertens was ok, saying 'Happy to hear Mertens is alright!' 

Mertens was a second half substitute for the Red Devils, as they were left frustrated by Chris Coleman's side during the Group B encounter.

His injury led to over six minutes of time added on, with Gareth Bale's header off the Wales goalline in the dying seconds preventing the hosts from stealing a win following a dominant display.
