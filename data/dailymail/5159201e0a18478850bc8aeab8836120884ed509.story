With only days to go before his daredevil wire walk across the Grand Canyon without a safety harness and live on television, Nik Wallenda has released a stomach churning video of what his daring feat will involve. 

The sky walker is seen walking between two looming buildings in his home town of Sarasota, Florida, and fighting to keep his balance as giant fans are directed at him to recreate conditions at the Grand Canyon.

Crowds of spectators have been gathering every day to watch as Wallenda and his team practice for  his 1,200ft walk without tethers or safety nets about 1,500ft above the Little Colorado River on Sunday.

At a height higher than the Empire State Building, the walk
will be the highest tightrope attempt ever for the 34-year-old.

For two weeks, the holder of a half-dozen world records and the only person to walk on a wire over the brink of Niagara Falls, has 
been practicing for what will be his biggest feat yet.

The stunt by the seventh generation member of the famous Flying Wallenda acrobat family is scheduled to be 
shown live on the Discovery Channel on June 23.

Wallenda and his team have been trying to recreate the conditions he is likely to over the Grand Canyon.

Although the 
humid Florida heat is helping him adjust to the temperatures he is expecting, the unpredictable winds that whip through the Grand Canyon have been challenging.

To try to get a feel for dealing with them, Wallenda practiced walking on his wire cable as Tropical Storm Andrea battered the Gulf Coast.

His team also used air boats to create winds reaching 91mph as Wallenda walked on his hire wire.

'I'm
not scared of them,' he told the Santa Cruz Sentinel, as he walked gracefully across his wire in the specially made moccasins his mother created for him.

'I have to respect it, but I would never do what I do if I 
was scared,' he said.

Wallenda, who has dreamed of doing a wire walk across the Grand Canyon for years, says his act is made possible by good mental concentration and positive thinking.

'Once I get on that wire I get very peaceful ...  I look down and look at my surroundings, I hear crowds, I hear people in the audience.'

Since his first wire walk at the age of four, Wallenda he has been stung by a bee and had birds land on his balancing pole.

His first experience on a wire came before he was even born, when his mother performed a sky walk while six months pregnant.

In the final moments before starting one of his walks, he prays, then hugs his wife and three children, telling them he will see them in a few minutes.

'The first couple of steps are the hardest, so there's a lot of anticipation,' Wallenda, who proposed to his wife Erendira as they performed 30ft above crowds in Montreal, Canada, said.

He added: 'The hard part about doing live TV is waiting till the director says go.'

The wire walker, who has written about his feats in his book Balance, uses a specially made cable, more often used for ocean dredging to perform his feats.

His balance pole, which weights 43lb, is a vital piece of equipment, increasing his center of gravity and making it easier for him to adapt to conditions high above the ground.

Despite his positive thinking and training however, Wallenda is well aware of the dangers of the stunt.

His great-grandfather and legendary sky walker, Karl Wallenda, fell to his death at the age of 73, during a hire wire walk in Puerto Rico in 1978.

The legendary sky walker has been a source of inspiration for Wallenda, who recalls on his website watching footage of the tragedy when he was four.

His grandfather's belief that 'Life is on the wire, everything else is just waiting,' has stayed with Wallenda since childhood, and driven him to perform his amazing hire wire feats.

The televised sky walk over Niagara last year was watched by more than 13 million Americans on ABC. However, the safety clause in the network's contract meant Wallenda had to wear a harness.

'It was my dream to walk over Niagara Falls since I was about 5 or 6 years old, but part of that dream was taken away because I had to wear that harness,' he said. 'The exciting thing about this event is that I will not be wearing any tether or any safety whatsoever.'

Discovery will be filming the live stunt on Sunday in a remote section of the Grand Canyon national park, which is run by the Navajo Nation.
