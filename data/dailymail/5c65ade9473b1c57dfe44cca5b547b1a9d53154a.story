Vanessa Whitburn: She introduced racier plotlines to the long-running BBC Radio 4 show

Fans of Radio 4’s The Archers have called for the BBC to take the show back to basics in the wake of its editor’s departure.

Vanessa Whitburn will step down in May after 22 years, making her the longest-serving boss in the programme’s history.

But although she has increased ratings, she has been heavily criticised for ‘sexing up’ the show unnecessarily.

During her tenure The Archers has transformed from a sedate  tale of rural life to a serial filled with racy plots and steamy storylines.

Miss Whitburn’s overhaul initially led to the popular show achieving record ratings in 2005 due to its ‘Who’s the daddy?’ storyline involving brothers Ed and William Grundy and William’s wife Emma.

The programme received its  highest lunchtime audience of 2.44million and an average of 4.86million a week – the highest since January 2003.

However, it was a different story several years later with some 200,000 listeners ditching The Archers in revolt over the controversial storylines, which by then had included a gay wedding and one of the central characters betraying her husband.

Yesterday fans of the show posted comments on its website, underneath the announcement of Miss Whitburn’s departure, calling for the programme to return to its roots as a ‘simple story’ about rural and agricultural matters.

One wrote: ‘Hopefully whoever takes over can rescue this once great programme and restore it to something approaching its former glory.

‘Maybe someone who both lives in a small working rural village and has an appreciation for the realities facing agriculture, rural communities and rural business in the modern day.’

Another added: ‘Quality broadcasting was demoted in favour of scandal and red-top news. Many good farming stories were down-played by gossip and class reared its ugly head.

‘Those of us who live in a farming area find it a parody of reality.

'Hopefully a new editor will concentrate less on sexual liaisons and more on the place of farming today and its importance to our future in producing high-quality food.’

Another listener said: ‘Return The Archers to its USP. A rural community based in Middle England. Have proper agricultural input. Have accuracy. Have reality.’

Miss Whitburn, a former producer of controversial Channel 4 drama Brookside, said she was departing to ‘take a holiday, develop a project for TV drama and get involved in some more training overseas’.

She defended the changes she made, saying: ‘It’s zappier, it’s crisper, it’s faster and that’s because audiences require more.  I don’t think it’s necessarily  any racier.’
