Sometimes a result can mask an injustice but Phil Bardsley knew exactly what he was doing when he took out Chelsea’s Eden Hazard.

There was no possibility of him playing the ball and he made a challenge which could have seriously injured the Chelsea player.

The tackle sent the Belgian international flying in the air at the Britannia Stadium on Monday night

The fact that he was given a yellow card means the FA can take no further action.

Neil Swarbrick is not rated as one of the top Premier League referees and after missing such a blatant red card one can understand why.

Phil Bardsley should be gone here. 

The first foul by the Chelsea byline was worthy of a yellow, too. 

His manager Mark Hughes is not helping either. He has been complaining since the first minute. 

Chelsea’s only problem would come if they allow themselves to be sucked in to a scrap.
