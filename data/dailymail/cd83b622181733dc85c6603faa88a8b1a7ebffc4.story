On Friday it was revealed four sailors have been charged over a series of 'hazing' incidents that allegedly occured in 2011.

The Royal Australian Navy personnel will face court martial following a probe into apparent inappropriate and often sexual behaviour aboard the HMAS Ballarat.

The navy says the charges relate to allegations which emerged in the wake of last year's media reports of hazing rituals aboard the warship.

Chief of the Royal Navy Ray Griggs urged others to come forward when claims of inappropriate incidents emerged last year

In 2013, a former naval member spoke out with claims that sailors were 'set upon, stripped off and had things essentially put in their bums' to mark birthdays.

At the time of the allegations, Chief of Navy Ray Griggs called for others to come forward if they knew of similar instances of alleged inappropriate behaviour.

'All of Navy has worked to make people accountable for their behaviour,' Vice Admiral Griggs said on Friday.

'There is now no doubt that all personnel are aware that Navy has no tolerance for unacceptable behaviour.'

The incidents allegedly occurred on the HMAS Ballarat in 2011

This year, four naval members said to be involved in the incidents will face a general court martial.

Three have already been suspended for duty and officials are still determining whether they will suspend the fourth person.

Earlier this month it was announced the navy would take action against eight sailors following these allegations.

The eight personnel would be given a chance to respond to claims made against them and some could face expulsion while others only warnings.

Now four will face military court over the bizarre and inappropriate allegations.
