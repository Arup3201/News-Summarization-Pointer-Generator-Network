A Spanish designer who has become known for his melancholy style presents his latest collection of feminine and edgy separates on models with what appear to be rather badly bruised knees.

Manuel Bola単o, born in Barcelona but raised in Galicia, a sensitive, self-confessed introvert, called his latest offering The Boy With Sad Eyes.

His collection of bug-embossed netting, clashing textures and gothic lace-up boots was shown shown on the fourth day of the 080 Barcelona Fashion 2014 yesterday.

Influences appeared to be romantic, retro, sports and Gothic. While some models sashayed down the catwalk in cute drop-waist frocks others exposed plenty of flesh in micro crop tops and large hole mesh - and many sported those disturbing bruised knees.

The 
models' bashed-up beauty look, according to Bola単o's sombre description 
of the range, may represent a metaphor for a bruised feelings and a 
broken heart.

The
 designer, who's worked in fashion for more than a decade, describes his
 latest collection and cryptic though it may be, it does offer some explanation for his seemingly 'wounded' models.

'Let's talk about the first kiss, hidden 
from the world, in a corner. Tell me what you think of my life, of my 
adolescence. In a corner I treat my wounds, and my tears will be lost in
 the rain. I extend my hand, seeking to touch you, leaving the world, 
cleansing my body of your scent, like an idiot searching for lost rites.
 I'm going mad, everything tortures me, but I know how to love. My soul 
was pure.'

Bola単o 
moved back to Barcelona in 2002 where he studied Fashion Design 
Felicidad Duce, and after a brief working period as part of Mango's 
design team he decided to start working on his own collection.

The designer, who loves complexities in 
fashion, said his work is about little details, Romanticism, and 
artisanal aspects - and that he would always choose texture over colour -
 in an interview with La Monda magazine late last year.

He cites - somewhat unsurprisingly - Alexander McQueen and John Galliano as inspiration.
