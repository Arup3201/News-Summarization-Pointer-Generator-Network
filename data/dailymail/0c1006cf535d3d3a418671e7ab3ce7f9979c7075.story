When dog walker Melanie  Goodship noticed a group of boys on a raft at the opposite side of a reservoir, she could see some sort of drama was unfolding.

Only later did she realise the heartbreaking truth – that she had witnessed the moment her 17-year-old son  had drowned.

Yesterday the devastated mother told how  she was walking her dogs with her partner on Sunday, one of the hottest days of the year so far, when she spotted the boys in the distance.

Tragedy: James Goodship's body has been found in a reservoir at Burwain Sailing Club, Foulridge, Lancashire

It took her nearly half an hour to walk around to the other side of Lower Foulridge reservoir in Lancashire.

There, she was given the news that every mother dreads – that it was her son James who had gone missing in the water.

The 40-year-old civil servant said she hoped his death would act as a warning to youngsters who think they are ‘invincible’ not to cool off in open water.

Speaking from her home in Colne, she told how she had left James to spend the sunny evening with his friends. After watching the ‘commotion unfold’, she tried to phone him but received no answer.

Unknown to her, he had disappeared underwater after trying to swim from the raft to the shore. Police divers recovered his body ten hours later after searching through the night.

Miss
 Goodship said: ‘Not for one minute had we known what had happened until
 we saw a couple of his friends who were asking if we’d seen another lad
 and they said James had been there.

‘I
 was trying to phone James – there was no answer but I was thinking, 
“It’s ringing so he can’t be in the water”.

'What we didn’t know is that 
they had left their phones on the side.’

She added: ‘We couldn’t have 
done anything. We were too far away.’

Miss
 Goodship and her partner, 41-year-old policeman Emlyn Parry, were 
offered use of a kind local person’s home while they waited for news.

James’s body was found at 5.40am yesterday. Miss Goodship said her son 
was an experienced swimmer but she had warned him about reports of 
people dying in cold, open water.

‘He
 was full of life,’ she added. ‘He was a 17-year-old lad who had the 
rest of his life to live. As kids do, they were just messing about and 
he got  into difficulty.

‘They
 think they are invincible. They have no fear and are out to enjoy life,
 and unfortunately it’s a tragic accident. If it just helps one kid not 
do it again, that’s all that matters.’

Temperatures
 on Sunday peaked at 25.6C (78F). One of James’ friends, 16-year-old 
Liam Menmuir, said the group of seven found the raft on the bank and 
launched it. It drifted into the middle of the reservoir so James and 
another boy got off to swim back to shore.

Liam
 said: ‘‘The other lad got back on but James carried on and wanted to 
swim. He began shouting for help and disappeared.’ The other boy was 
taken to hospital for checks.

James,
 who had recently finished a plumbing course at Burnley College, also 
leaves his father Peter, 45, sister Lauren, 19, step-brother Jack, 15, 
and brother Thomas, seven.

His former girlfriend Martina Robinson wrote on social media: ‘He meant the world to me.’
