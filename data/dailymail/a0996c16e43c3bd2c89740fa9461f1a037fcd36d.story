Sephora has been accused of racism after a number of Asian shoppers found their accounts blocked during a recent online sale.

The retailer's Facebook page was flooded with more than 100 complaints from users with mostly Chinese surnames on Friday, demanding that Sephora unlock their accounts so that they could shop the store's VIB Rouge promotion, which offers a 20 per cent discount to customers who spend more than $350 a year.

Sephora was quick to issue an apology via its website, blaming a high level of bulk purchases from ‘automated accounts’. The firm believed that these accounts were bulk-buying with the intention of reselling merchandise – a practice it hopes to prevent.

The statement read: 'What caused the disruption yesterday was a high level of bulk buys and automated accounts for reselling purposes from North America and multiple countries outside the US.’

The company made no reference to the accusations of ethnic profiling but explained that ‘we have identified certain entities who take advantage of promotional opportunities to purchase products in large volume on our website and re-sell them through other channels. 

‘After careful consideration, we have deactivated these accounts in order to optimize product availability for the majority of our clients, as well as ensure that consumers are not subject to increased prices or products that are not being handled or stored properly.’

In complaints posted on Facebook and Reddit, users noted that those registered under Asian email addresses, such as qq.com and 126.com, were among those blocked – though customers with Asian-sounding names registered under a U.S. or Canadian address were also affected.  

Reddit user huaer, who first posted about the controversy on the site's MakeupAddiction forum Friday, expressed disappointment with the store's response.

'I do not agree with the way Sephora has handled the situation, and believe that they have disappointed many of us in these past few days,' she wrote. 

Angry customers continued to post grievances on the company's Facebook page over the weekend. 

Chenyi Ebe Zhu, a California resident who hails from Zhuhai, in China's Guangdong province, wrote: 'Thank you Sephora. Thank you for blocking my account, which makes me decide NOT to shop at Sephora any more. Why should I still give my money to such a racist company?' 

As of Monday afternoon, the final day of the VIB Rouge sale, the problem seemed to persist.

Shuo Wang, of Waterloo, Ontario, wrote on Facebook: 'My online account is locked without any reason! I am really disappointed at it!' 

Nanjing University student Zoey Shen added: 'I want to unlock my account because I am not a reseller. I just want to buy something for myself.'
