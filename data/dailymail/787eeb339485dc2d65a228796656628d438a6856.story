A 21-year-old man in Montgomery County, Texas was arrested on Saturday after tying a donkey to his Toyota pick-up truck and towing the animal several miles. 

Authorities say suspect Nasim Irsan didn't even think anything was wrong with dragging the aging donkey at least three miles  Saturday afternoon.

They stopped him near the 18000 block of Old Houston Road where the animal was handed over to animal control and Irsan was arrested on animal cruelty charges.

Charged: Driver Nasim Irsan, 21 (left), has since been charged with cruelty to an animal after police spotted him towing the donkey 

'He didn't think he was doing anything wrong – that he was moving it from one place to another,' Precinct 5 deputy livestock constable Marshall Williams said. 

Williams says Irsan had tied the donkey to his truck with a single rope connected around the animal's neck and at the hitch. 

Luckily the donkey appeared to be in 'fine condition' when Irsan was stopped. 

Witness Hazik Hassan saw the donkey after Irsan was stopped by police and told KTRK that the scene was 'pretty terrible'.  

'That was a long way for a horse, and it was an older horse, mule I mean. You could see its ribs and everything, that's pretty sad man,' Hassan said.
