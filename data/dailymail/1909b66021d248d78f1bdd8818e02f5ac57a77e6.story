Every child wants the room of their dreams. And now a bed company that creates handmade fantastical bedrooms for A-list offspring has the power to make them come true.

A host of celebrities have used PoshTots to custom-make their offspring a bed worthy of royalty, Hollywood or otherwise.

From Jay-Z and Beyonce and Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin to Julia Roberts and Donald Trump Jr, there is barely a big name in showbiz that hasn't tapped into the company's prowess, purchasing bespoke designs 
that can turn their children’s bedrooms into a magical world.

The Princess  Rose Daybed, £6,184 ($9,900) features hand carved rose garland embellishment and Swarovski rhinestones can be added for an additional charge

The stunning Sunken Viking Ship Bed and deep sea mural are custom designed and no specific price is given

If you want your child to have full scope to let their imagination run wild the English Tudor Cottage Bed costs an eye watering £21,868 ($35,000)

Supermodel Heidi Klum and Seal chose a fairy-tale concept for their daughter Leni's room, while last year Jay-Z and Beyonce took delivery of a £30,000 coach carriage crib for baby Blue Ivy.

Other happy high profile clients have included Ben Stiller, actor Dylan McDermott and Law & Order star Benjamin Bratt, as well as tennis ace Pete Sampras.

PoshTots' incredible detailed designs allow the creation of such masterpieces as a Viking ships, complete with sea mural, and a to-scale Tudor cottage bed.

Quite literally bringing childhood dreams to life, the visually stunning beds could have fallen out of a fairy-tale book.

Of course, such high design doesn't come cheap.

Celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow have purchased beds from the bespoke company, with Beyonce and husband Jay-Z purchasing a PoshTot's coach carriage crib for daughter Blue Ivy

For the baby that has everything PoshTot's have created the Majestic Carriage Crib which costs £7,185 ($11,500). It's constructed with a solid cedar frame and birch details and features a front faux leather seat with the rear box designed as a changing table

The spectacular Fantasy Coach is custom designed, with prices starting at £40,607 ($65,000). It takes over 6 months to make and the oval-shaped interior measures just over 6 ft. in diameter

The Richmond, Virginia company was started thirteen years ago by founder Andrea Edmunds. Pictured is the Fairytale Gardens Mural and Carriage Bed, (price on application)

If you want your little ones to constantly feel on holiday you could invest in the Tropical Surf Shack Bunk Bed at £9995 ($16,000)

The tropical surf shack bunk bed will set you back £10,000, while a 'Chuckwagon' Wild West toddler bed also costs £10,000, with even the more basic designs ranging from around £500 to £1,200.

The company also sells bedding and bedroom furniture, as well as mural designs to adorn walls for those who want to complete the transformation of bedroom to fairy grotto, princess palace, or pirate ship at sea.

The Richmond, Virginia company began thirteen years ago when founder Andrea Edmunds was expecting her second child and wanted to create a special ‘grown-up room for her little girl to move into.

After struggling to find just the right balance of quality and creativity for the bedrooms, Andrea created PoshTots to source artisans who could design the unique creations.
