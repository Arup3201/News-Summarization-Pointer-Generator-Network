A private rocket successfully sent a capsule full of cargo zipping to the International Space Station, but the craft couldn't deliver on job No. 2: putting a commercial satellite into the correct orbit.

One of nine engines on the SpaceX company's Falcon 9 rocket failed on Sunday - 79 seconds after launch due to a loss in pressure.

The engine didn't explode, but it did start a series of events that meant another company's private satellite is not in the place it is needed.

The main mission for the Falcon launch - delivering half a ton of science and food supplies toward the space station - is still on track with a docking of the cargo-laden Dragon capsule scheduled for Wednesday.

SpaceX on Monday said the ship's flight computer calculated a new path to the station for the capsule. It is the first of a dozen supply runs under a mega-contract with NASA.

'Falcon 9 did exactly what it was designed to do,' the California based SpaceX said. 'Like the Saturn V, which experienced engine loss on two flights, Falcon 9 is designed to handle an engine out situation and still complete its mission.'

But not all of its mission.

Problem: The engine didn't explode, but it did start a series of events that meant Orbcomm's private satellite, sending it into a lower orbit than what was intended

The original plan was for Falcon to fire its second stage engines after Dragon left and then deploy an industrial communications satellite into orbit for Orbcomm of Dulles, Virginia.

Because this is a new resupply ship for the space station, NASA and its international partners had set detailed safety rules in advance for Falcon, even though the engine failure was far from the station.

And those rules prevent SpaceX from firing its second stage engines, Orbcomm said in a statement.

The satellite is in a lower orbit and engineers are trying to figure out how to boost it, Orbcomm said.

This was the first of 18 satellites that Orbcomm had hired SpaceX to deliver.

The satellites help in two-way communications for companies to track their heavy equipment across the world.

The company wouldn't respond to questions about the cost of the satellite or launch services.

Harvard University astronomer Jonathan McDowell, who tracks launches worldwide, noticed the problem for hours before either company acknowledged that the satellite was in the wrong orbit.

Even though SpaceX was congratulating itself after the launch, McDowell said: 'We can't say that it was a perfect launch.'

The commercial cargo ship rocketed into orbit on Sunday, the first of a dozen supply runs to the space station under a mega-contract with NASA.

It was the second launch of a Dragon capsule to the orbiting lab by the California-based SpaceX company. The first was last spring.

This time was no test flight, however, and the spacecraft carried 1,000 pounds of key science experiments and other precious gear.

There was also a personal touch: chocolate-vanilla swirl ice cream tucked in a freezer for the three station residents.

NASA is counting on private business 
to restock the space station, now that the shuttles have retired to 
museums.

The space agency has a $1.6billion contract with SpaceX for 12
resupply missions.

Especially exciting for NASA is the 
fact that the Dragon will return twice as much cargo as it took up, 
including a stockpile of astronauts' blood and urine samples. The 
samples - nearly 500 of them - have been stashed in freezers since 
Atlantis made the last shuttle flight in July 2011.

'While it may seem very strange to some 
folks, my typical line is that, "It may be urine to you, but it's gold 
to us,"' said NASA nutritionist Scott Smith. 'There's a lot of science that comes out of this.'

The
Dragon will spend close to three weeks at the space station before 
being released and parachuting into the Pacific at the end of October.

By then, the space station should be back up to a full crew of six.

None
of the Russian, European or Japanese cargo ships can bring anything 
back; they're destroyed during re-entry.

The Russian Soyuz crew capsules
have limited room for anything besides people.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp.,
or SpaceX - owned by PayPal co-founder Elon Musk - is working to 
convert its unmanned Dragon capsules into vessels that could carry 
astronauts to the space station in three years.

Other
U.S. companies also are vying to carry crews. Americans must ride 
Russian rockets to orbit in the meantime, for a steep price.

NASA's space station program manager, 
Mike Suffredini, is thrilled about having an American spacecraft 
bearing goods. It's much easier to get last-minute equipment aboard a 
U.S. capsule, he noted.

The Dragon, for example, will carry up a new 
pump for the space station's urine-into-drinking water recycling system.

'Shipping and customs can kill you when you're trying to get overseas,' Suffredini said.

Musk,
who monitored the launch from SpaceX Mission Control in Hawthorne, 
California, called the capsules Dragon after the magical Puff to get 
back at critics who, a decade ago, considered his effort a fantasy.

The 
name Falcon comes from the Millennium Falcon starship of Star Wars 
fame.

An
estimated 2,400 guests jammed the launching center to see the Falcon, 
with its Dragon, come to life for SpaceX's first official, operational 
supply mission.

'Just over a year since shuttle 
retirement, to be able to do that is, I think, what people are very 
excited about,' said NASA's deputy administrator, Lori Garver.

Across the country at SpaceX headquarters, about 1,000 employees watched via TV and webcast.

SpaceX is shooting for its next supply run in January.

Another
company looking to haul space station cargo, Virginia's Orbital 
Sciences Corp., hopes to launch a solo test flight in December and a 
demo mission to the station early next year.

NASA,
meanwhile, expects to name within a few weeks the U.S. astronaut and 
Russian cosmonaut who will spend an entire year aboard the space 
station, beginning in spring 2015, twice the usual length for a mission.
Suffredini said the list of potential candidates is 'very short.'

Another
NASA official said only previous space station crew members are under 
consideration for the two slots because they're already trained in the 
systems of the orbiting complex.

On
Friday, the space agency said it would commit to a yearlong mission to 
learn what it will take for humans to journey beyond low-Earth orbit â€” 
Mars, for example.

Russia
already knows. Three cosmonauts spent at least a year aboard the old 
Mir space station; the record for single stint is almost 15 months.

No American has spent more than seven months in space at a time.
