Doctors allegedly left a woman in agony after she broke her back in two places playing with her children.

Mother of nine Toni Connell, 37,from Whiston, near Rotherham in South Yorkshire, was rushed to hospital after she landed heavily after crashing off the end of a 30-foot long slide.

But two doctors in Rotherham Hospital examined X-Rays of her back and discharged Ms Connell with painkillers after dismissing her injuries as bruising.

Ms Connell was rushed back to Rotherham Hospital in agony again 24 hours later and the following morning a surgeon re-examined the same X-Rays and told her she had broken her back in two places.

Ms Connell was taken to Sheffield's Northern General Hospital where she underwent an operation to insert metal rods to stabilise her spine.

She said she was disgusted at her treatment at Rotherham, and is now recovering at home.

Ms Connell, who has children aged from 11 months to 18 years was on a trip to Rotherham's Clifton Park with her children visiting the annual Rotherham Show on September 7.

She said as the children played happily they went down the big tunnel slide - a curving metal tube big enough to take adults.

Ms Connell - who is afraid of tube slides - finally decided to ignore her fears after being 'egged on' by her children.

She said: 'All the kids went down the slide before me and they were shouting 'come on mum get down it'

'I have a fear of tunnel slides like that but they kept on at me so I took the plunge and went down. But at the bottom I just flew off and landed hard on my back.

'Straight away I knew there was something wrong and I had been injured.'

Paramedics were in the park for the show and were on scene quickly but decided that Ms Connell needed an X-Ray to assess the damage because she was in so much pain.

But things went wrong from the time she arrived at nearby Rotherham General Hospital's accident and emergency unit.

She said: 'I arrived at hospital and was given a tablet painkiller then left for around three hours before a doctor came and ordered X-Rays.

'The A and E department was very busy and I waited another hour after the X-Rays were taken, before another doctor came and said they were clear and I was just badly bruised.'

It was 1 am when she was given the news and she was kept in spending the night on the clinical decisions ward (CDU).

She said: 'The next morning I was seen by a physiotherapist because I was still struggling to walk. I was then discharged without seeing another doctor or any further follow up.'

After she was allowed home the pain continued and she fell in her bathroom.. As a result she was bed bound by severe pain in her upper back and hips and was unable to use the crutches the hospital had loaned her.

Rotherham Hospital said it was 'sorry' to hear Ms Connell was 'unhappy' and was investigating her complaint

Ms Connell added: 'I became hysterical because the pain was so bad and it was in a house full of kids who were wondering what was happening.'

Husband Glynn called for an ambulance and she had to be carried out on a stretcher to return to the hospital that had discharged her 24 hours earlier.

Another doctor examined her X-Rays after she was admitted and said there had been some damage to her upper back but said she was fit enough to return home with painkillers.

However, Ms Connell, still wracked with pain, refused to leave the hospital and staff reluctantly admitted her onto a ward.

She said: 'The next morning an orthopaedic surgeon looked at the same X-Rays and told me I had two quite bad breaks in my back.

'He said: 'yes you have done a pretty good job at it as well' as if to say 'I can't believe you've done that on a children's slide'.'

A CT scan also revealed a slight change from the earlier X-Rays because the broken bones had crushed into her spinal canal and an operation was needed.

Ms Connell said: 'I'm angry and disgusted that that it was overlooked on X-Ray. I shudder at the thought if I didn't go back to hospital I could still be at home suffering and ended up with permanent nerve damage.'

A hospital spokesman said: 'We are very sorry to hear that Mrs Connell is unhappy about the treatment she received at Rotherham Hospital.

'The Trust takes issues such as these very seriously. The Trust's patient experience team is working with Mrs Connell to investigate this matter.'

Andy Lee, Urban Green Spaces manager for Rotherham Council said he was sorry to hear about the accident but said both the slide and safety surface conform to British and European safety standards.
