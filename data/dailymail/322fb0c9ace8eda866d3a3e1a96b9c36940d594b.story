The use of contraceptive pills causes around 2,500 blood clots and 20 deaths every year in France, according to the country's health watchdog.

The National Agency for the Safety of Drugs and Health Products (ANSM) undertook a study that found the pill was linked to thrombosis, or blood clots. 

Blood clots can be deadly, causing strokes or heart attacks if they get lodged in the brain or the heart.

A total of 14 of 20 deaths were caused by third and fourth generation pills - launched in the last 20 years - while the remaining six were blamed on first and second generation pills, reports the Daily Telegraph.

A study by a French health watchdog has found that the use of contraceptive pills causes around 2,500 blood clots and 20 deaths every year in the country

The third generation pill was introduced in the 1990s and the fourth generation pill was approved within the last ten years.

The third and fourth generation pills are currently under scrutiny because of the case of 25-year-old Marion Larat, who has filed a lawsuit claiming that a later generation pill left her seriously handicapped following a stroke.

'The risk of venous thromboembolism applies to the population as a whole, but the risk is low,' ANSM said. 'It increases with age for all women, regardless of whether they use oral contraceptives or not.

'It is higher for users of third and fourth generation contraceptives than for users of first and second generation contraceptives.' The ANSM study was based on a statistical model.

In France the use of contraceptive pills is among the highest in the world. In 2011, nearly 4.27million women were on the pill.

However, after the health ministry 
decided to more strictly regulate the prescriptions of these pills, the 
sales of the third and fourth generation of pills fell sharply.

After it was recently linked to four 
deaths, regulators in France suspended sales of the hormone treatment 
Dianette, which is also used as an oral contraceptive and is known to 
increase the risk of blood clots. In Canada, 11 deaths have been linked 
to the drug.

The European Medicines Agency, which 
regulates medicines across Europe, announced last week it will now carry
out a review into its safety.

In the UK, concerns about the drug 
were raised following the recent deaths of several young women, among 
them Shannon Deakin in 2011.

he 16-year-old from Hoyland, South 
Yorkshire, had been prescribed Dianette by her GP for acne and had been 
taking it for around four weeks before she died from an undiagnosed deep
vein thrombosis, when a blood clot from her leg travelled to her lungs.

Blood clot: Third and fourth generation pills are currently under scrutiny in France because of health concerns

Dianette — or Diane-35 as it’s known in France — is prescribed to more than 62,000 British women a year, usually for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal problem affecting young women which leads to multiple small ovarian cysts, irregular periods, acne and excess facial hair.

The condition is caused by an imbalance of the male sex hormone testosterone, which women also produce (it’s thought to help muscle strength and contribute to sex drive).

Dianette is a combination of two drugs — cyproterone (a form of the female hormone progesterone) and ethinylestradiol (an oestrogen), which effectively suppress the effect of testosterone.

As progesterone prevents ovulation, Dianette also works as an effective contraceptive.

'When you prescribe Dianette, you explain to patients there is an increased risk of blood clots, although the risk remains low'

While other oral contraceptives carry a small increased risk of blood clots — which can be dangerous and potentially fatal if they travel to the lungs or brain — the type of progesterone in Dianette means the drug has one of the highest risks of blood clots of all oral contraceptives.

Cyproterone is 65 per cent more likely to cause a blood clot than levonorgestrel (a type of progesterone found in older oral contraceptive pills), according to a review of 25 studies published last year in the European Journal of Contraception And Reproductive Health Care.

The risk of a blood clot while taking Dianette is, however, small.

Around 40 of every 100,000 women on it develop a blood clot in one year, compared with between five and ten women in 100,000 who are not taking the drug, according to the Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Low-dose combined contraceptive pills carry the lowest risk of blood clots — approximately half the risk of Dianette.

But the Dianette risk is still lower than the risk of a blood clot during pregnancy (about 60 cases for every 100,000 pregnant women).
