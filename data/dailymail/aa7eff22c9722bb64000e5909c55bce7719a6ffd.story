Job security is an issue that concerns us all, but particularly so if you’re a football manager.

Arsene Wenger, though, doesn’t have to worry. Win, lose or draw, the Frenchman’s job is safe as houses. No danger.

How many managers have that luxury in the Barclays Premier League? None, probably.

Rightly or wrongly, Wenger has made himself untouchable in north London.

That notion has split opinion among supporters.

There are those who remember the good times, the Premier League titles, the FA Cups and the Invincibles.

But there are those who cannot forgot about the barren years; those who are fed up with the club’s perennial underachievement.

Last season’s FA Cup triumph against Hull - their first trophy in nine seasons - was quickly followed by the announcement of Wenger’s new three-year contract.

Aaron Ramsey’s extra time Wembley winner was supposed to herald a new era of Wenger domination.

On the back of two disappointing results, both in which they inexplicably gave away leads, that dream of a dominant Arsenal seems a world away.

Wenger has already thrown in the towel in the title race, while the Gunners look destined for a second place finish in their Champions League group, meaning they are likely to meet one of Europe’s superpowers in the last 16.

Apply a similar scenario at, say, Chelsea or Manchester City.

Would Jose Mourinho or Manuel Pellegrini have the same level of job security? Probably not.

Unless Wenger decides to walk away from the Emirates Stadium (and he has been very open with his views on breaking contracts), the Frenchman will remain at the helm until at least 2017.

But that’s not to say there isn’t any forward planning in place at Arsenal.

The club are certainly planning for life without Wenger; keeping abreast, doing their research, on the best emerging managerial talent in Europe.

There are the obvious candidates: Borussia Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp, Germany manager Joachim Low and Bayern Munich’s Pep Guardiola.

Then there are the less obvious, Mainz’s former manager Thomas Tuchel (currently unemployed) has caught the eye, while Everton’s Roberto Martinez and Ajax’s Frank De Boer are also being studied.

They’ve even researched managers in the obscure Austrian Bundesliga to have a succession plan in place once Wenger calls it a day.

The Gunners board know Wenger’s reign is in its final throws, and want to make sure they have the right man.

Arsenal watched on with interest to see how Manchester United would deal with the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.

The Old Trafford club’s demise has certainly not gone unnoticed by the powers that be at the Emirates.

And the Gunners know they cannot afford a similar plight and are determined to get their next managerial appointment right.

They don’t want to make a ‘flavour of the month’ appointment. They have two-and-and-half years worth of homework still to do ensure they make the correct appointment.

In saying that, who’s to say Wenger won’t want to carry on past his 67th birthday?
