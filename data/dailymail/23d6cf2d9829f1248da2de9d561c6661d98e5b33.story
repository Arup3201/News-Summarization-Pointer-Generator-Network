Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced that the Australian government will donate $20 million to help staff a 100-bed Ebola response clinic in Sierra Leone.

Mr Abbott said that the government would be contracting an external company to deploy staff to the region. 

The clinic will be built by the UK and over 200 staff will be needed to run it, comprising mostly of locals.

However, Australian volunteers and international medics will also be needed.

The mission follows a deal struck between the governments of Australia and the UK and healthcare provider Aspen Medical to manage services in a British military field hospital in Sierra Leone.

 Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced that the Australian government will donate $20 million to help staff a 100-bed Ebola response clinic in Sierra Leone.

Mr Abbott said that he has received assurances the 100-bed clinic would treat Australians who contract the disease overseas as if they were British citizens. 

He also revealed that  a further $2 million will  be sent to Sierra Leone to enhance the regional preparedness for Ebola.

Another $2 million will go to Australian logisticians working with UN agencies such as the World Health Organisation in West Africa.

Mr Abbott stated that the chances of an outbreak of Ebola in Australia are still very low, but he said that the government recognises that this is a global problem.

Australia has provided $18 million in aid, but the only Australian workers in west Africa are volunteers working with non-government organisations. 

Speaking at a press conference, Mr Abbott said that the centre should be up-and-running as soon as possible and he hopes to have it open by the end of November.  

'My anticipation is that Aspen will have some staff on the ground in Sierra Leone within days,' Mr Abbott said.

'It will be up to Aspen to decide who should staff the centre in Sierra Leone but it's an Australian company,' he continued.  

As of October 31, 13,500 clinical cases of Ebola had been detected in West Africa. 

While there have been no confirmed cases of Ebola in Australia, almost 5,000 people have died from the disease in Africa.   

The Prime Minister also stated that the chances of an outbreak of Ebola in Australia are still very low. 

However, the government has been taking no chances and they have been ramping up security in preparation for the disease going global.

Screening at airports has been installed for people arriving from west Africa.

Mr Abbott said that while he acknowledges the impact Ebola is having internationally, he would like to keep the upcoming G20 summit focused on economic issues.

Opposition leader Bill Shorten commended the Abbott government for taking the first step against the Ebola outbreak.

 Mr Abbott said that the government would not be sending Australian's over to Sierra Leone, but they would be contracting an external company to deploy staff to the region.

'We are please the government is finally making an overdue first step on the Ebola epidemic,' Mr Shorten said.

Deputy leader of the opposition Tanya Plibersek said that there are Australians willing to help stop the outbreak going any further, by providing their support in Sierra Leone. 

 'We have hundreds of Australians that have said they'd go if facilitated by this government,' she said.

She also revealed that the opposition party has no problems with Aspen Medical being involved in the clinic.  

Australian Medical Association President Brian Owler expressed his joy at the government's response to the Ebola crisis, although he issued a warning to Australians wishing to help out in Sierra Leone.

'Im pleased today that this announcement has been made to fund the Aspen group to supply the services'

'There is sill a lot of work to be done'

Mr Owler said that a number of  vital questions still need to be answered. 

'I think there are a number of questions we still need answers to,' he said.

He stated that any Australians wishing to be a part of the new facility would need to be provided with training and resources. 

'We certainly want any Australian to be able to return safely,' he said. 

Mr Owler said that the Australian public should have confidence in Abbott's plans and in the Aspen facility. 

'We do have people who would be able  to go to Sierra Leone and do this work,' he said. 

In a statement Aspen Medical said they are prepared to help fight the deadly disease.

'Aspen Medical already has a presence in North West Africa where it has been running a clinic in Liberia for several months.' the statement read.

'Aspen Medical is also known for its healthcare service to the Australian Government in the Solomon Islands.'
