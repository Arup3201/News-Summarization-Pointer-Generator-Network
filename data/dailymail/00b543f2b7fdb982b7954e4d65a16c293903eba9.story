Ed Miliband was last night accused of trying to cover up a donation from a controversial banker who has faced calls to be stripped of his knighthood.

Sir Victor Blank – the former Lloyds TSB chairman blamed by shareholders for the bank’s humiliating £21 billion taxpayer bailout – gave £10,000 to Labour just days after Mr Miliband made a major speech attacking bankers’ behaviour.

Sir Victor paid the money by bidding at a Labour fundraising auction for a set of handwritten team talk notes by Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

The notes, prepared for the 2011 Champions League Final against Barcelona, had been secured by Tony Blair’s former spin chief Alastair Campbell, who is a friend of Sir Alex.

Sir Victor did not attend the auction in July but used a proxy bidder to buy the lot for £10,000. The Labour Party recorded the bid in its donations register – but said that it had come from Rothschild bank.

Last night a Conservative MP called on the Electoral Commission to investigate whether Labour leader Mr Miliband had attempted to cover up Sir Victor’s donation.

Under Electoral Commission rules, all such successful bids have to be included on the public register of donations. 

Labour declared the donation – from ‘Rothschild Private Banking’ – on July 25, two weeks after Mr Miliband had given a speech in which he attacked the behaviour of financiers and pledged ‘to build banks that serve the people, not just themselves’.

Sir Victor incurred the wrath of Lloyds shareholders when he agreed to Gordon Brown’s request to save the ailing Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) by mounting a takeover in September 2008.

The former Prime Minister – who made the suggestion at a drinks reception which has subsequently been dubbed ‘the most expensive cocktail party in history’ – said that competition rules would be relaxed to allow the deal to be rushed through.

Disastrously, shares in the newly formed Lloyds Banking Group soon plunged by 90 per cent.

The Financial Services Authority (FSA) is now investigating the circumstances behind the merger and is expected to report in the spring.

Last year, activists representing 800,000 Lloyds shareholders joined MPs in calling for Sir Victor to be stripped of his knighthood if he is censured by the FSA.

Their demands came after Fred Goodwin, the former boss of the Royal Bank of Scotland, saw his knighthood forfeited for his role in the bank’s near collapse, a move backed by Mr Miliband.

Last night Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he had written to the Electoral Commission to ask why the donation had been misregistered. In his letter, Mr Bridgen says ‘the public will want to be assured that the Labour Party did not purposefully cover up his donation to avoid negative media coverage’.

He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It beggars belief that Labour – whose failure to regulate the banks helped cause the biggest bust ever – are now taking cash from the man who broke Lloyds, leading to a multi- billion-pound taxpayer-funded bank bailout. By either reckless incompetence or deliberate misrepresentation Labour hid the fact that Sir Victor Blank gave Ed Miliband’s Labour Party thousands of pounds last summer.

‘Which failed banker will Labour be taking money from next – Fred Goodwin?’

A source close to Sir Victor said that the ex-banker had bid for the team talk because he was a keen  collector of sporting memorabilia. ‘Someone bid on his behalf, and the cheque was sent by Rothschild because the bank manages his private trust. That is clearly why the mistake happened.’

A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘This was an administrative error by the Labour Party which we have already corrected with the Electoral Commission,’ adding that it was now recorded as a personal donation by Sir Victor.
