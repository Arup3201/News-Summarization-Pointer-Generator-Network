These pictures reveal the latest designs for the next set of luxurious multi-million pound suites planned for the revamped Battersea Power Station.

More than £600million of property inside the iconic building has already been sold after phase one, Circus West, was launched earlier this year.

Now, developers behind the revamp, Battersea Power Station Development Company (BPSDC), have unveiled the latest designs and prices of the second phase of plush apartments – which are to be put on a ‘London-only’ sale in May.

Around 254 homes will be released as part of the next stage of redevelopment – with prices for a studio apartment starting from £800,000 and ranging up to £4million for a four bedroom home.

Guide prices for the homes also include one-bedroom apartments from £1 million, two-bed apartments from £1.5 million and three-bedroom homes starting from £2.7 million. A penthouse price is available only on application.

The old power station, which sits on the banks of the River Thames, has become one of London's best-loved landmarks, with numerous failed attempts to revive the Grade II listed building over the past three decades.

It was designed by British architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott who also worked on other well-known structures including Liverpool Cathedral, London’s Waterloo Bridge and Bankside Power Station which has since become the Tate Modern. He also designed the iconic red telephone box before his death in 1960.

Since Battersea Power Station ceased generating electricity in the 1980s, development proposals for what is Europe's largest brick building have included a Disneyland, a nightclub, a football club and just about everything in between.

Now owned by a consortium of Malaysian investors, the 39-acre site is being completely redeveloped to include a six-acre public park, office space for 5,000 people, around 200 shops and restaurants and leisure and recreation facilities.

The new homes will boast ‘bold, beautiful and generously-sized’ living spaces and will fall into two styles across three different locations of the landmark building - The Switch House East, The Switch House West, and Boiler House Square at the top.

More than 250 apartments and townhouses built within the iconic Battersea Power Station are set to go on the market in an exclusive 'London-only' sale on May 1

A number of apartments will sit in the original fabric of the building, among exposed brickwork and industrial fittings, while other homes, in a ‘panoramic, glazed style’ will be on top of the power station looking out over the River Thames, or back onto the famous Boiler House facade.

All of them will have access to more than 1.5 acres of roof top gardens while many will have their own private outdoor space.

Boiler House Square will be on top of the tall, central Boiler House between the chimneys with two new storeys built around an open, landscaped garden square with a central skylight, while Switch House East and West will lie on the longer, lateral flanks of the power station.

The interiors have been designed by London-based interior designers Michaelis Boyd Architects, who describe the style as ‘refined industrialauthentic, highly tactile and visually dramatic’, and will be around 40% larger than average new build developments in London, according to developers.

Rob Tincknell, Battersea Power Station Development Company chief executive, said: ‘This launch is genuinely a once in a lifetime opportunity to own one of a small number of very special bespoke residences that have been meticulously designed to reflect the quality and detailing applied to Giles Gilbert Scott's original masterpiece.

The converted Battersea Power Station will be surrounded by a modern garden area featuring an array of plants and seating areas, pictured, where residents will be able to relax and take in the view of the extensive redevelopment

‘Being significantly larger than many other comparable new home residences in London and with the best in class design and specification, homes at the Power Station have been designed with a view to attracting owner-occupiers who want to be at the heart of the vibrant community planned for the Power Station.’

The launch of the new properties at Battersea Power Station will be held in London only on May 1 as part of a commitment to prioritise UK buyers.

Prospective buyers will have to register their interest and attend allocated sales appointments.

The redevelopment of the building will create 15,000 new jobs, 3,500 new homes and a privately-funded extension of the London Underground at Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station.

The revamped Power Station will feature 200 shops and restaurants a state-of-the-art performance venue, cinema, six-acre riverside park and a new Underground tube station, which will connect to the Northern line
