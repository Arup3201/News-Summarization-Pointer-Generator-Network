The moon just got younger - by a few hundred million years.

Scientists now claim that the moon is around 4.4 and 4.45 billion years old, rather than the 4.56 billion years previously thought.

Despite being the nearest body to the Earth, astronomers are still not sure precisely how or when it formed.

One theory suggests the moon formed when a planet, around the size of Mars, collided with Earth around 4.56 billion years ago. 
This collision divided Earth into two unequal parts. The smaller of these condensed into the Moon

One theory suggests the moon formed when a planet, around the size of Mars, collided with Earth around 4.56 billion years ago.

This collision divided Earth into two unequal parts. The smaller of these condensed into the moon.

The best simulations of this process suggest that about 80 per cent of moon ought to have come from the impactor and 20 per cent from the Earth.

Scientists have long studied the moon’s crustal rocks to try and estimate its age.

As methods have improved, the most precisely determined age for the lunar rocks that arose is 4.360 billion years, the researchers said.

Meanwhile on Earth, scientists have found signs of a major melting event that occurred around 4.45 billion years ago.

From this, researchers have drawn the conclusion that the catastrophic collision that formed the moon occurred around 100 million years or so before.

‘There are several important implications of this late moon formation that have not yet been worked out,’ said Richard Carlson, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington.

‘For example, if the Earth was already differentiated prior to the giant impact, would the impact have blown off the primordial atmosphere that formed from this earlier epoch of Earth history?’

The results were presented yesterday at a meeting organised by the Royal Society in London called ‘Origin of the moon.’

A controversial new theory has been proposed that a giant explosion equivalent to 40 billion atomic bombs originating from the Earth's core somehow led to the formation of the moon.

Planetary scientist Wim van Westrenen believes this violent event took place approximately four-and-a-half billion years ago and could answer the hotly contested question of where our moon comes from.

The scientist, from VU University in Amsterdam, told New Scientist magazine that previous explanations about how the moon came to be simply do not add up.Chemical analysis of the rocks last year by the University of Chicago found that they shared identical oxygen, silicon and potassium isotopes with Earth, hinting that the Moon shares its origin with the Earth.

Van Westeren said that taken at face value, the findings suggest that the moon was once part of the Earth that was blasted into space by an enormous explosion from the Earth's fiery core.

To do this, he believes that there must have been a 'massive energy kick' delivered quickly and he calculates that the explosion was the strength of 40 billion atomic bombs the size of those dropped on Hiroshima.
