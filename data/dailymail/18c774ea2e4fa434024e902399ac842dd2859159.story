An unlikely entrant is about to join the space race next year, as Scotland launches its first home-built satellite.

The country's first satellite may not cause too much jealousy at Nasa - the UKube-1 satellite is made of three 10cm by 10cm cubes, slightly more modest than the International Space Station.

UKube-1 is being built at the West of Scotland Science Park in Maryhill, Glasgow by a local company, Clyde Space.

Clydespace's UKUbe-1 satellite will be the first satellite to launch from Scotland - the hi-tech vehicle is expected to launch next year

ClydeSpace's Systems engineer Steve Greenland says, 'People often ask me what my job is and I tell them that I'm building satellites in Maryhill'

‘Sometimes they don't believe it. Sometimes they laugh at me.’

Clyde Space has made dozens of tiny 'CubeSat' vehicles for other companies - 10cm by 10cm cubes.

Chief Executive Craig Clark says, ‘A typical CubeSat mission was a 
student-built satellite that would maybe go beep or try something out 
that didn't cost a lot of money.'

But the company is to link three cubes together to create UKube-1 - which will be the first complete satellite to be assembled by Clyde Space.

It's part of a pilot programme from the UK Space Agency to test new technologies in space.

Mechanical design engineer Steven Kirk is well aware of its particular significance for Clyde Space - and for Scotland.

‘It's our first full platform,’ he said. ‘So by demonstrating this we can demonstrate that we can build a full satellite. We'll have the pedigree.’

CubeSat is expected to enter orbit next year.

To
 boldly go: Scientists hope to have UKube-1, which stands for United 
Kingdom Universal Bus Experiment, in orbit later this year

The underlying CubeSat concept came originally from America - to create a satellite 10cm by 10cm by 10cm.

More than 600 CubeSats have been launched so far. The Glasgow firm has made components for 40% of them.

Examples
 include NASA's GeneSat-1, a 5 kilogram CubeSat which is carrying 
bacteria inside a miniature laboratory and NASA's Firefly mission which 
is studying the relationship between lightning and mysterious bright 
flashes of gamma radiation in the upper atmosphere of our planet.

The
 low-Earth orbit of CubeSats is also ideal for disaster monitoring and 
Earth sciences, as the lower a satellite orbits, the less time it takes 
to complete a revolution of the Earth.
