Now that's a bear hug! 

The adorable moment a mother bear races up to her cub to give it a loving embrace was captured in an incredible series of images, taken by Canadian nature photographer Marc Latremouille.

In slow motion the brown bear - which weighs around 400 pounds - is pictured running towards its fearless baby, as it stands ready and waiting to meet its mum.

The heart-warming pictures are part of a series of photographs taken when Marc, 47, travelled to the Lake Clark National Park, based in Alaska.

The others show a pair of cute cubs play-fighting, racing together and hunting for clams at the salt marshes. They later sit in the grasslands to relax.

Marc explained how he took the incredible sequence of pictures of a mother bear charging at its young.

'I was photographing mother bear and two spring cubs digging for razor clams in the mud flats,' he said.

'As we all know, little ones are always curious and playful, and this particular cub decided it was playtime and started chasing gulls for fun.

'Moments later, the mother realised that one of her cub was way too far from her.

'She ran straight towards him and as you can see from the cub's expression - he knew he was in trouble.

'She quickly led him back to his sibling and continued digging for clams.'

Around 95 per cent of America's brown bear population make their home in the northern state of Alaska.

Lake Clark National Park has recorded 219 bears in a 50-mile radius, meaning this area has one of the highest brown bear population density in the world.

'These bears are some of the biggest bears on the planet,' said Marc.

'Being close to one for the first time, without a fence between each other, is nerve-racking.

'But you soon realise, in this particular area, you are not on the menu.

'They have plenty of food available to them and don't see us as a threat.'
