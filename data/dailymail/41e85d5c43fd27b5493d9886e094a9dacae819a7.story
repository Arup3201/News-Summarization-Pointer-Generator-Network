The new away jersey for the United States men's and women's national soccer teams has been revealed in advance of the World Cup -- and fans are in an uproar.

Designed by Nike, the jersey features three different-colored bands, starting at the top with blue, white, and red to represent the American flag, according to a company press release. The away kit also includes red shorts and red socks.

However, fans have taken to Twitter to express their disapproval -- and many are comparing the new jerseys to the French flag, as well as those of the Netherlands and Russia.

The jersey's color scheme has caused outrage and confusion among fans

'Is this April Fool's? Trying to look like France?' one fan wrote on Twitter in response to the colorful away kit

Not American? Former U.S. National Team Member Alexi Lalas seems to disagree with this dramatic pose

'Is this April Fool's? Trying to look like France?' one user wrote.

'Away US soccer kit is alright but reminds me of France, Russia, Dutch. Not American and neither is that lighter blue! #USMNT' another tweeted.

'The new #usmnt jersey is basically the flag of France upside down...way to screw it up Nike,' one said.

'Wanna see the new #USMNT jerseys?  Google "Netherlands Flag"' another user wrote.

The famed French flag features panels of blue, white, and red going from left to right. The Dutch flag, however, features panels of red, white and blue going from top to bottom.

The new away jersey has even been compared by USA Today to frozen popsicles.

At least two noted players are fans of the jersey -- U.S. Men's National  Team Captain Clint Dempsey and Women's National Team striker Sydney Leroux.

'I like the patriotic design and color scheme and I think it will look great on the pitch,' Dempsey said, according to the Nike press release. 'Hopefully they will serve us well as we head into a competitive group.'

'The new kits fit really well, look great and most importantly, are really comfortable, especially when we are running all over the field for 90 minutes in all sorts of different weather,' Stryker said in the release.

Though some have compared the US away jersey to the Russian flag, the Russian jersey, seen here, looks rather different

Despite fans' objections, the away jerseys for three nations will look different from the ones for the US.

The French away jersey is white with light gray stripes. The Dutch away jersey will be blue with an orange Netherlands badge. Both teams' jerseys are also designed by Nike.

The Russian away jersey, designed by Adidas, features an outline of the earth, which looks like a series of blue stripes. A company press release says it is supposed to represent the view that Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, saw Earth in 1961.

The rest of the jersey is white, with an emblem of the double-headed eagle.

At least one fan seemed to have a hopeful approach to the new US jersey on Twitter.

'So the new USA home and away kits are absolutely terrible...but you know what makes a good kit is a kit you win in #USMNT.'
