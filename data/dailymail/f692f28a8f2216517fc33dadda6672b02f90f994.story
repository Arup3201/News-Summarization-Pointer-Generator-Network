A blind widow has barely missed a  game of her beloved Yeovil Town FC in 17 years, after becoming hooked on the roar of the crowd.

Audrey Dyson began attending the team's home matches with her only son Nigel after the death of her husband Bob, 77, who was an avid Yeovil fan.

The 90-year-old, who lost her sight two decades ago, has never physically 'seen' a match but was captivated by the cheers of the crowd, so much so that in 17 years, she has almost never missed a home game.

Audrey follows each game on local radio commentary from her regular seat where she proudly wears a green and white Yeovil shirt with matching hand-knitted blanket for her knees.

She cheered on her club this week when they beat Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup to line up a Third Round home clash against Manchester United in the New Year.

Audrey, a retired chemist and bookkeeper, said: 'Around 17 years ago my husband died and I'm blind and I can't get out on my own.

'My son said to me there was a friendly match down at Yeovil - he had been going since he was 16 - where they were playing Stevenage.

The pensioner, who always wears her Yeovil Town shirt, and scarf to the matches, became hooked after hearing the roar of the crowd

'I had never been before but I said I would go. When Yeovil scored a goal, the noise they made and the whole atmosphere, it was just electric. It just thrilled me and I was hooked.

'My son asked me if I wanted to go again, and I said I would and I went for the rest of the season, buying a ticket each time.

'The next season I bought a season ticket and I've had one ever since.'

She added: 'I take a radio with headphones and listen to BBC Somerset, and despite not being able to see it means I can follow the game ball by ball, along with the atmosphere all around me.

'We know the people who sit around us very well now, and they are all very helpful.

'I went to the doctors recently and asked if there was anything they could do, but he said to me if I was his grandmother, he wouldn't recommend an operation.

'I've got used to things now, and I just get on with it. I enjoy the game as it is.

'It seems to fascinate people the fact that I'm blind, and I'm 90.

'I think people probably laugh and think I'm a bit odd, but I don't mind that - I'm enjoying myself.'

Audrey, from East Pennard, Somerset, started losing her sight 30 years ago due to glaucoma and cataracts, and was been fully blind for more than 17 years.

She relied on husband and retired teacher Bob to help her get out, and when he passed away in 1997 Nigel asked her to the football as a way to keep active.

Audrey sits in the Screwfix stand at Huish Park with Nigel, 50, and daughter-in-law Lucy, as well as nine-month-old granddaughter Georgiana, who also has a season ticket.

The grandmother-of-one, who has been clerk on her parish council for 40 years, is helped up 14 steps to her seat by Nigel and a steward.

She has barely missed a game and was in her regular spot on Tuesday night as her favourite 'Glovers' won.

Audrey, a former Brownie leader said: 'It was so exciting, it was lovely, but it was a bit nail biting all the way through.

'I kept thinking 'I'm sure they are going to score', wishing we would just score.

'It was half time and it was still nil nil, and then with just six minutes to go I was expecting it to go to penalties.

'Then suddenly there was this great sound from the crowd around me but I didn't know who scored because I couldn't hear my radio - the noise was just so much.

'When Nigel sat down I asked who scored and then I heard it and there was more cheering and it was about five minutes before we did it again.'

The cup tie against Man United is on January 4, and Yeovil will pocket £144,000 in TV profits plus a further £67,500 if they knock out Louis Van Gaal's side.

'My daughter-in-law is ringing up for tickets for the Man United game today,' said Audrey.

'I don't know what will happen in that one, it depends what sort of team they send.

'We can only hope - it's just the doing of it.

'Everybody it talking about it now. People have become a lot more interested in it because it is Man United.

'But it is the excitement that I enjoy - and of course there are many disappointments too - and waiting to know what they are doing and how they are getting on.

'I'm not interested in in football in the higher leagues at all.'
