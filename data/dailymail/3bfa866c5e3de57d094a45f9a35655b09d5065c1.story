A father-of-two who spent three nights lying seriously injured in a ditch after being hurled from his motorcycle only got upset when he realised his bike had been written off.

A police search party spotted the wreckage of Anthony Margrave's bike in a 7ft deep ditch between the busy East Yorkshire Road and a field and peered down to find the 40-year-old from Goole, East Yorkshire, lying face up below him.

The policeman shouted to his colleagues: 'I think he’s dead' but then he saw Mr Margrave blink and realised he was still alive.

Mr Margrave was rushed to Doncaster Royal Infirmary where he was sedated and placed on a ventilator in intensive care.

He was suffering from hypothermia, a fractured spine, and broken ribs and needed surgery to clear his airway.

His sister Sharon Margrave, 42, said yesterday: 'He asked how his bike was and we said it was so crumpled you could not tell one end from the other.

'That was the only time he lost his sense of humour and swore. His jeans were also expensive and he was pretty upset they had to cut them off.

'But he has still got his sense of humour and smile. He is so brave and we are all really proud of him.

'It is a miracle he is still alive. We were worried sick and so thankful. The police have been fantastic. They never gave up on him.'

The drama began on Tuesday evening when Mr Margrave left his home in the East Yorkshire Village of Rawcliffe Bridge on his black Yamaha, telling a friend he was going for a short ride.

He was only 15 to 20 minutes into his journey when his machine left the road less than ten miles from the village.

When no one heard from him and the concrete operative failed to turn up at work in Pollington, his girlfriend Katie Bridgeford, 38, became alarmed.

His family reported him missing and Humberside Police launched a huge search.

Inspector Rob Cocker said his team found his phone had not been used in the 24 hours up to his partner reporting him missing.

They also found the phone had not moved from the area between Thorne and Goole, which is large and sparsely populated.

Inspector
Cocker said that officers, assisted by the South Yorkshire Police 
helicopter, began days of searching rivers, reservoirs, fields, ditches,
houses, gardens, and any other likely location the man could have been 
in the area around Thorne, Rawcliffe and Snaith.

At
about 11.20am on Friday, September 14, officers found a small amount of
debris from a motorbike at the side of the A614, just north of Thorne.

Family and friends also turned out to help search. Ms Margrave said: 'It’s been absolutely dreadful. We thought at first he had just gone off. Then we thought he was dead.'

Mr Margrave was finally found at midday on Friday, lying face up in the ditch with his motorcycle jacket and jeans drenched from Thursday’s rain.

Ms Margrave said: 'It was right in the bottom of the ditch by the main road. He could hear traffic and horses going past him and was shouting: ‘Help me. Help me’. But no one came. No one could see him because he was right at the bottom of the ditch.

'He was conscious form most of the time. He could feel bugs on his face but could not move his hands to wipe them off.

He told me: 'I had my phone and my baccy in my pocket but could not reach either of them’.'

Finally, he managed to pull his phone out the pocket of his jeans. 'He turned it on but then he got loads of text messages coming in from friends asking ‘where are you?’ and the battery went dead,' Ms Margrave, 42, added.

Mr Margrave, who is single but has two children by a former relationship, remains in critical care in Doncaster but has been taken off a life support machine.

Officers said they believe the 
motorcyclist collided with a metal signpost on the off-side of the 
carriageway and then traveled approximately 200m further along the 
carriageway before coming to rest in a ditch.
