The number of people in Britain needing weight loss surgery has rocketed in the past decade and now includes children as young as 13.

Figures show those undergoing gastric band surgery or a similar procedure have risen 16-fold in 10 years.

And with new guidelines meaning a million more people may be eligible, experts have warned the obesity crisis will lead to a major financial strain on the NHS. 

Gastric band operations, which reduce the size of a patient's stomach so they physically cannot eat too much, cost the health service around £6,000 per procedure. 

In 2003, 509 people were offered a weight loss procedure, including gastric bypass, gastric bands, gastric balloons or bubbles or stomach staples.

But since 2011, more than 23,000 people were given bariatric surgery. 

These include 570 people under 25. In total, 62 children under 18 were given gastric bands and among them were 17 morbidly obese children under the age of 16. 

On the other end of the scale, 234 pensioners also had surgery to lose weight. 

The research, from the Government's Health and Social Care Information Service (NICE), parallels the massive rise in people being classed as obese and suffering from Type 2 diabetes.  

Now, NICE, up to a million more people could be offered weight loss on the NHS.

About a million people already qualify, but funding decisions are made by NHS organisations meaning around 9,000 operations happen a year.  

Experts have warned the obesity crisis will lead to a major financial strain on the NHS. Gastric band operations cost £6,000 per procedure 

Professor Mark Baker, Centre for Clinical Practice Director at NICE, said: 'The financial implications of obesity are huge – 10 per cent of the NHS budget is used to treat diabetes and its complications alone. 

'It is a major issue, if not the major issue, for the health service in the coming years.' 

Last year, 6,500 weight loss procedures were performed in the UK and NICE has recommended that all patients with a BMI of 35 (severely obese) or over who have recent-onset type 2 diabetes should be assessed for surgery.  

Dr Rachel Batterham, Head of Obesity and Bariatric Services at University College London Hospital Trust, who was involved in developing the guidance, said: 'We know that surgery can make a real difference for people with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. 

'The health benefits of weight loss surgery are so great that it should be considered as part of the treatment for obese diabetics. 

'The earlier you have the surgery in your diabetes course, then the more likely you are to have remission or a really good improvement.'
