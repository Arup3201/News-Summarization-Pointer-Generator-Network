Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has argued that his side's performance in their 1-1 draw at Chelsea on Saturday proved there is still plenty of life left in the title race.

City, bidding to be the first team since Manchester United in 2009 to retain the Premier League crown, trail Chelsea by five points after sharing the spoils at Stamford Bridge.

But the visitors were the better team with Sergio Aguero missing three good chances to score and Fernandinho also shooting wide from a well-placed position.

In contrast, Chelsea failed to produce a single shot after Loic Remy's goal after 41 minutes, which was cancelled out four minutes later by David Silva.

Pellegrini said: 'We tried to win the game from the first minute to the end so while I am not happy with getting only one point, I am proud of the performance.

'Of course it was important to close the gap, but we still have 45 more points to play for. Although it was a very important game, it was not the final.'

Pellegrini's side were the more adventurous of the two teams despite being the away team.

The City manager doesn't like Mourinho but refused to directly criticise Chelsea's defensive methods.

'I think both teams have a clear style of play that they think is best for them,' he said. 'I am not saying Chelsea played for a draw.'

However, the City boss will have Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony available after the African Cup of Nations pointed out his team had 'tried to create space against a team who defended well and near their box.'

He added: 'We came for the three points.'
