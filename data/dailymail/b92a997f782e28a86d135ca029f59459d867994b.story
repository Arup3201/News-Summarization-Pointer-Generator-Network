Remark: Sir Edward Grey (pictured) said 'the lamps are going out all over Europes; we will not see them lit again in our lifetime'

Britons will be asked to turn off their lights to mark the 100th anniversary of the moment war was declared in 1914.

The Lights Out project is inspired by then foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey’s remark at the outbreak of the First World War that: ‘The lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.’

The event, at 11pm on August 4, is part of a nationwide series of works announced yesterday by Culture Secretary Maria Miller.

Planners are hailing it as ‘one of the most dramatic UK-wide events ever organised’ in which ‘people from all four nations will be invited to turn off their lights and to replace them with one single light to remember a day that changed the world forever’. They have not said how long the switch-off will last.

Germany declared war on France and invaded Belgium on August 3, 1914.

That evening, Sir Edward Grey gazed across St James’s Park from his window at the Foreign Office as the lamps were being lit on the Mall and made his now famous remark to a friend, John Spender.

Other plans for the 14-18 NOW programme include a one-off Proms performance where the work of war poets will be set to music, four specially written songs by guitarist Richard Thompson and an online war memorial with contributions from the public.

Mrs Miller said: ‘Ensuring a cultural element flows throughout the centenary will be a vital part of our commemorations, particularly as a way of engaging young people and helping them make that connection with the past.

‘The programme will help all of us to pause in remembrance and to understand the resonance of the First World War today.’

Other activities include a theatrical re- telling of the story of the Liverpool Pals regiment. Two ships, one in dry dock in Liverpool and another on the Thames, will be painted in the style of the dazzle ships which were camouflaged with complex patterns of geometric shapes that made them difficult to track.

Commemoration: Events will also include a concert at London's Royal Albert Hall

The late night prom at the Royal Albert Hall will see German composer Torsten Rasch and the Philharmonia Orchestra perform a 40-minute work featuring verse by writers including Robert Frost, Edward Thomas and Rupert Brooke.

The performance on August 4 will be followed by Lights Out where people will be invited to turn off their lights and replace them with a single light including specially-commissioned digital light works which will be available to download for free.

Project director Jenny Waldman said: ‘We are commissioning some of the world’s leading artists to respond to the events of the First World War and the wider social political, cultural and scientific developments of the period.

‘And to respond with a contemporary perspective - to explore the resonance of the First World War today. I am particularly delighted about the way artists have responded to the brief and the wonderful enthusiasm our cultural organisations have shown in their support for the programme.’
