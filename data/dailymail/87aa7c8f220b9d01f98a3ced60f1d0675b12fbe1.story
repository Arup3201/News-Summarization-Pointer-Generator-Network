Imagine arriving at your own home and finding out a stranger is not only squatting there — he's claiming the place for himself.

That's the nightmare that an elderly New York City woman is living, and now she is fighting to get back the house that she says an ex-con stole from her by filing a fraudulent deed and breaking in.

'It just devastates me,' Jennifer Merin told the New York Post.  'The house was maintained basically as sanctuary to my family.'

Merin says that 49-year-old Darrell Beatty and his sons — Darrell Kash, 25, and DeShaun, 22 — have been living at the home in Queens since February.

She says Beatty filed a bogus deed and moved into the house, which Merin wasn't renting, then changed all the locks.

Heartbroken: Jennifer Merin is battling to get the Queens home back after a man claimed it with a fraudulent deed

Marin's home (center) was purchased by her immigrant grandparents in the 1930s and is where her mother was raised. The Queens residence is now occupied by Darrell Beatty, who says he bought it in 2013

She found out that the house that her grandparents, who immigrated from the Ukraine and Russia, bought in 1931 had been lifted back in May, when the water bill for the previously-empty home skyrocketed.

When Merin when to check, she found the locks had been changed and her 1992 Subaru Outback missing — along with most of her possessions. 

All of her family's heirlooms — vintage furniture, photos, a classic television set — were piled in the garage like trash.

'Everything from Chinese palace vases to my underwear,' she told the Post.

Merin says that Beatty filed a deed transfer claiming that he bought the house in 2013 from a woman named 'Edith Moore' — who doesn't seem to exist, according to public records.

'I see them coming and going,' a neighbor said of the Beatty trio to the Post. 'I don’t think they talk to nobody in the neighborhood.'

The city's Finance Department says the deed was indeed fraudulently transferred in 2013.

Officials in June put Merin's name back on the document  — but now she's battling in court to have the Beatty clan.

A judge has approved an eviction for Beatty, but the order was stayed because the squatter says he is having health problems. 

He claims to have rented the house from a 'Khalid Moore' for $10,000 with an option to buy.

Several reporters have attempted to confront Beatty outside his home, but he always refuses to comment.

He only confirms his version of the story: that the house is his.
