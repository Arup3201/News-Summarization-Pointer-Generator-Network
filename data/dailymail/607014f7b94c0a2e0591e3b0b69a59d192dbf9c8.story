A teenage boy faces murder charges for allegedly killing his girlfriend Anne Kasprzak, 15, when he was just 14 years old in 2012.

The Draper City Police Department said in a release that the alleged murderer, whose name has not been released, 'is being held at a detention center in Colorado and following extradition proceedings will be transported to the Salt Lake area.'

The 17-year-old boy faces a first-degree felony murder charge as well as a second-degree felony obstruction of justice charge, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.

The police department said in the news release that 'On about March 11th 2012 at about 10:30am, a jogger noticed blood and a shoe on a pedestrian bridge at the Jordan River. The jogger notified police of the suspicious circumstances and emergency services responded.'

'A helicopter searched the immediate area and saw what they believed to a be a human body in the river,' it continued. 'Salt Lake County Search and Rescue responded. Anne's body was recovered from the Jordan River within the Draper city limits. Autopsy results indicated she died from blunt force trauma to the head.'

The Salt Lake Tribune reported that a probable cause statement alleges Kasprzak and her boyfriend called each other multiple times the night she went missing.

The statement also reportedly says that when police requested his shoes, the boyfriend explained away the blood by saying his girlfriend suffered a nosebleed at a friend's house.

How did it happen? Anne Kasprzak's boyfriend is accused of killing her in 2012 

According to the newspaper, the statement claims the friend told police the same story about Kasprzak's supposed nosebleed, but later said it was a lie following their discovery the boyfriend texted him about the fake explanation.

The statement also reveals Kasprzak's boyfriend admitted to his pal he went to the Jordan River, said not to spread the information and to get rid of his text messages, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.

The probable cause statement, obtained by The Salt Lake Tribune, says 'The defendant’s shoes were tested and human blood was located in multiple areas on both shoes. Further testing on the human blood on both shoes yielded a DNA profile which matches the DNA profile of Anne Kasprzak.

It also reportedly claims the boy's wastebasket held paper 'with facts about the case, a rough time line, and a line describing a jacket "she" was wearing "that night."

The boy's whereabouts that evening could be pinpointed to show he was near where Kasprzak's body was found, the statement reportedly claims.

Though two adult suspects were previously investigated, a story about their alleged kidnapping of Kasprzak turned out to be bogus, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.

Mother Veronica Kasprzak said at a news conference filmed by Fox 13 about the arrest 'While it feels incomplete to say that it is any sort of relief because while we support the police and the attorneys office and appreciate all of the work they have continued to do, it does not change what happened.'
