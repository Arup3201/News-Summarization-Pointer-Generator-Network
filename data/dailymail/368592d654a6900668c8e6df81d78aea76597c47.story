Griff Rhys Jones, who was friends with Smith for more than 35 years, has lead tributes.

He told ITV News: 'I still can't believe this has happened. To everybody who ever met him, Mel was a force for life. He had a relish for it that seemed utterly inexhaustible.

'He inspired love and utter loyalty and he gave it in return. I will look back on the days working with him as some of the funniest times that I have ever spent.

'We probably enjoyed ourselves far too much, but we had a rollercoaster of a ride along the way. Terrific business. Fantastic fun, making shows. Huge parties and crazy times. And Mel was always ready to be supportive. Nobody could have been easier to work with.

'We never had an argument about which
part we should play or how we were going to do something. We loved 
performing together. He was a very generous and supportive actor. We had
a good deal of fun.

'Mel was not a pressure person. He 
was a gentleman and a scholar, a gambler and a wit. And he was a 
brilliant actor. But he never took himself or the business too 
seriously. We are all in a state of shock. We have lost a very, very 
dear friend.'

Friend and television producer John Lloyd told the BBC he had not seen Smith for some time because of his poor health.

'Mel had kept himself to himself since he became ill. He kind of let it be known that he wanted that he didn't want to see people which is terribly sad.

'I personally feel terrible that I didn't see him in the last few weeks,' he said.

Tributes have been paid to the late star on Twitter.

Comedian and broadcaster Stephen Fry 
wrote: 'Terrible news about my old friend Mel Smith, dead 
today from a heart attack. Mel lived a full life, but was kind, funny 
& wonderful to know.'

Author Kathy Lette said: 'R.I.P. Mel Smith. Sorry to bring sad and bad news, but apparently he 
died from heart attack in his sleep.'

Writer Irvine Welsh added: 'Sad to hear about the death of Mel Smith, who gave me loads of laughs.'

Smith was described as having 'extraordinary natural talent' by Peter Fincham, director of television at ITV.

Mr Fincham, who was the business partner of Smith and his comedy sideback Griff Rhys Jones at Talkback Productions as well as their agent, said: 'Life was always exciting around Mel.

'He was my friend and business partner for many years and had extraordinary natural talent with the rare gift of wearing it lightly.

'Being funny came naturally to him, so much so that he never seemed to give it a second thought. Mel and Griff were one of the great comedy acts and it's hard to imagine that one of them is no longer with us.'

In 1999, the Alas Smith and Jones actor ended up seriously ill in hospital after he took an accidental overdose of more than 50 Nurofen tablets.

It came after a long addiction to sleeping pills, which he blamed on work and pain caused by gout.

Smith was one of the major success 
stories of Not The Nine O'Clock News which ran on the BBC from 1979-82 
alongside Rhys Jones, Pamela Stephenson and Rowan Atkinson.

He also set up Talkback Productions, 
one of the biggest independent production companies and talent agencies 
which created Smack The Pony, Da Ali G Show and I'm Alan Partridge.

Smith
had been a director since his days at Oxford University, and went on to
have more success behind the camera with films such as Bean, The Tall 
Guy and Blackball.

Though he and Jones sold Talkback in 1999 to Freemantle, Smith remained one of the key figures in UK comedy.

During an appearance on Celebrity Mastermind in 2009, Smith had appeared frail and slurred his words.

It later emerged he had been suffering from severe pharyngitis. He leaves his wife Pam, the couple had been married for 24 years.

Father Ted writer Graham Linehan said
he and writing partner Arthur Mathews had been helped in their career 
by Smith, with their first sketches being broadcast on Alas Smith and 
Jones.

He
wrote on Twitter: 'Very sad to hear news of Mel Smith's death has been 
confirmed. He and Griff gave Arthur and I our break. Was always so kind 
& generous to us.'

Actor
and comic Peter Serafinowicz also paid tribute. He wrote: 'Very sad to 
hear about Mel Smith. He did something very kind for me early in my 
career even though he hardly knew me. Such a funny man.'

Tributes: Mel Smith's friend Peter Fincham described him as an 'extraordinary natural talent'

Smith attended Oxford University while Jones was at Cambridge and the pair became known to each other while performing at the Edinburgh fringe.

They became friends working on Not the Nine O'Clock News and then went on to make Alas Smith and Jones, which lasted for 10 series over 16 years.

Smith and Jones formed production company Talkback together, which was sold in 2000. The duo last worked together in a sketch show in 2012.

BBC director general Tony Hall said: 'Mel Smith's contribution to British comedy cannot be overstated. On screen he helped to define a new style of comedy from the late 1970s that continues to influence people to this day.

'And his pioneering TV production work with Griff Rhys Jones through their company Talkback has created many of the defining comedy shows of recent decades.'

Rowan Atkinson, who worked with Smith on both Not the Nine O'Clock News and Bean, the first Mr Bean film, said he was 'truly sad' to hear about his death.

In a statement, he said: 'Mel Smith - a lovely man of whom I saw too little in his later years. I loved the sketches that we did together on Not the Nine O'Clock News.

'He was the cast member with whom I felt the most natural performing empathy.

'He had a wonderfully generous and sympathetic presence both on and off screen."He was also an excellent theatre and movie director, doing a wonderful job on the first Mr Bean movie.

'If you direct a comedy movie that takes 245 million dollars at the box office you've done something pretty special, and I never thought he was given enough credit for this success.

'I feel truly sad at his parting.'
