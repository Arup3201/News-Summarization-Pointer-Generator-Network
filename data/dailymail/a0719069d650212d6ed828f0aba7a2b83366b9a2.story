Miss England slept rough on the streets of Cambridge last night  as temperatures dipped to 4C to highlight the plight of the homeless in the UK.

Carina Tyrrell, a Cambridge University student doctor, slept under a city bridge near Midsummer Common in the run up to World Homeless Day on Friday.

The 24-year-old was among an estimated 40 people who slept on the streets in Cambridge last night and among 2400 people nationwide.

Carina says she felt freezing cold and vulnerable during her night on the streets of Cambridge 

Carina, who does shifts at the city's Addenbrooke's Hospital, was given a sleeping bag, blanket, mat and emergency pack by Jimmy's Night Shelter

As president of the university's Global Health Society she has been working with the homeless for the last three years as part of its outreach programme.

The programme integrates students in the community by helping the homeless.

'It was freezing cold and at around 4am it started raining and felt damp and misty, I can't imagine sleeping like that night after night,' said Carina.

'I woke up every hour of the night and slept with one eye open as I felt constantly on edge.

'I felt really vulnerable as there were lots of people walking by late at night and a fox crept past at one point. I had loads of layers but I couldn't get warm or comfortable.'

Carina, who does shifts at the city's Addenbrooke's Hospital, was given a sleeping bag, blanket, mat and emergency pack by Jimmy's Night Shelter, who often have to turn people away as they are full.

'I wanted to raise awareness of the homeless and show people it's not just drunks who are sleeping on the streets,' added Carina.

Carina also went to Wintercomfort in Cambridge for breakfast, which offers support to people who are homeless, providing meals and showers, as well as educational support

The beauty queen was among an estimated 40 people who slept on the streets in Cambridge last night and among 2400 people nationwide in an effort to raise awareness of homelessness 

'There are so many forms of homelessness, such as people who sleep in cars or on other people's sofas.

'Some homeless people actually have good jobs, they just don't have accommodation, and there are far more younger people and women who are homeless now, which you don't expect.'

Carina, who was crowned Miss England this summer, went to Wintercomfort in Cambridge for breakfast, which offers support to people who are homeless, providing meals and showers, as well as educational support.

She added: 'I think people can help the homeless by reconsidering their views as to what being homeless is, as there is a lot of stigma attached.

'People can also help by donating old clothes, sleeping bags, blankets and food to their nearest homeless shelter.'

Carina is studying medicine at Cambridge University's Murray Edwards College, but has taken a year off to focus on her Miss England projects and prepare for Miss World in December.
