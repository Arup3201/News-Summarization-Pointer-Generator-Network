A British man has died in the French Alps after falling close to 2,000 ft while skiing off piste near Chamonix.

David Tapsfield, 28, was ski touring when a snow cornice, an overhanging edge of snow on a ridge, collapsed from under him. His fall triggered a huge avalanche which swept him down the mountain.

The experienced mountaineer, who had moved to France from Whitley Bay a few years ago, was described by friends as 'highly popular and very down-to-earth'.

Accident: David Tapsfield, 28, was ski touring near Chamonix, when a snow cornice, an overhanging edge of snow on a ridge, collapsed from under him

Mr Tapsfield was with a Scottish friend, Lorne Cameron, from Glasgow, who survived uninjured.

The tragedy happened at about 1pm on Tuesday on Mont Buet, the highest mountain peak in the Chamonix area outside of the Mont Blanc Massif.

Mr Cameron frantically dug his friend out of the snow and tried to resuscitate him. He alerted the emergency services who airlifted Mr Tapsfield to hospital.

But, tragically, he was pronounced dead on arrival.

A Chamonix police spokesman said: 'A cornice ruptured and the person fell a very long distance - about 600 metres.

'The fall triggered the slide of a huge mass of snow or an avalanche.

'The man's friend found him under the snow and pulled him out. He gave him first aid and the man was taken by helicopter to hospital but sadly he died.'

Mr Tapsfield had moved to Chamonix a few years ago to pursue his love of the mountains and set up a successful sausage-making business selling his wares to local restaurants and pubs.

As a teenager David was part of the Football Development Scheme for 16 to 19-year-olds at Tyne Metropolitan College in North Tyneside.

In 2005 he won a scholarship at Lafeyatte College in New Jersey, USA, one of the top six colleges in the country, to study and play the game.

Location: The accident took place on Mont Buet in the French Alps, near the ski resort of Chamonix

Ian Bogie, ex-Gateshead and Stockport manager, who helped run the scheme at the college, knew David and is devastated by the news of his death.

Mr Bogie, of Tynemouth, said: 'I am absolutely shocked. I can't believe this has happened to David. He was a very talented footballer and he was on our scheme.'

'He was genuinely a smashing lad and I'm so shocked.'

A snow cornice is formed by wind blowing snow over a sharp terrain break, such as the crest of a mountain or along the sides of gullies, where it attaches and builds out horizontally.

It is extremely dangerous to ski or hike on them or underneath them and the vulnerability of the structure poses a high risk of triggering avalanches.

They are particularly dangerous during sunny weather and the area has experienced warm weather during the past week.

A spokesperson from the Foreign & Commonwealth Office said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national, in Chamonix on 25th February.

'We stand ready to provide consular assistance upon request.'

This is the second deadly skiing incident involving a Briton in just two days.

A 23-year-old man from South London died on Monday after crashing into a snow cannon after losing control going down black piste in the Austrian Alps.

The man, only identified as Alexander O, had refused to wear a crash helmet, his mother told police, and died at the scene after hitting his head on a metal pole on the snow cannon in St. Anton.
