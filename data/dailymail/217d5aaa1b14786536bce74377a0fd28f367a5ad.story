The parents of a six-year-old boy who was stabbed in the throat with a pencil by a classmate have spoke of their outrage that the school failed to call an ambulance for their child.

Ruben Aguilar, who is six years old, was hurt last Thursday by another boy who asked him: 'Have you played chicken?' before reportedly stabbing him in the neck.

The boy's parents, Ruben Aguilar and Monica Haga, are angry that their son was not taken to hospital in an ambulance or treated by a nurse at the California school.

Ruben Aguilar, aged six, was stabbed in the throat with a pencil last Friday by a classmate at his California elementary school but teachers refused to call an ambulance. His grandfather took a picture of his injury

Instead, teachers called his parents and 
Reuben was forced to wait for his grandfather to come and collect him at
 Crowell Elementary in Turlock.

Ruben's father, who was held up at the dentist, said that several doctors who treated his son at the hospital questioned why Ruben had not been brought in by ambulance. 

The six-year-old's mother Ms Haga told KCRA: 'Doctors say the pencil could have punctured his trachea. They had a full team available before they removed the tape.'

Ruben was later transferred by ambulance from one hospital to another so further work could be done on his injuries. 

The six-year-old's parents have taken him out of the school after saying their son was too scared to go back.

Parents of other pupils at Crowell Elementary are also furious that they were not told about the incident which left many children afraid to go back to class.

In a statement, Turlock assistant superintendent said that all procedures had been followed and that they were unable to discuss matters dealing with minors.

The six-year-old was worked on by doctors are two different hospitals, according to his parents who took this video on a cellphone
