An American student has created a Batman-style suit that can withstand assaults from punches, baseball bats and even knifes.

Jackson Gordon, an industrial design student from Philadelphia University, constructed the armoured suit with money raised through Kickstarter – a global crowd-funding platform designed to aid creative endeavors.

Hoping to raise $1000 to begin the project, Jackson received backing from 17 enthusiasts and raised $1255 – more than enough to begin assembling the suit.

Without breaking a sweat: Jackson Gordon holds his hands behind his head as his friend tests the suit with some heavy punches

Made from Kevlar and silicone moulds, the Batsuit weighs in at just under four stone and took the 21-year-old from Wayne, Pennsylvania five months to complete from start to finish.

Videoed testing the final product with a friend, Jackson  is featured being repeatedly punched in the chest, back and sides while wearing the suit.

Despite  Jackson flinching slightly under the impact of the punches, the suit is remarkably durable and the young designer even calls for his friend to hit him harder and with both hands.

Laughing as the blows rain in, Jackson showcases the strength of the soft plates on the side and shoulder area alongside the harder ones, which also hold up well against the impact.

Smiling at the camera in admiration for his suit, The student says: ‘I could do this all day. I can’t even feel it.’

This is the second batsuit created by Jackson, who previously made one based on Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight Trilogy a year before.

The student recently tested his new suit at Maryland’s Katsucon – an annual three day anime convention – in February, where he invited people to assault him, unsuccessfully of course.
