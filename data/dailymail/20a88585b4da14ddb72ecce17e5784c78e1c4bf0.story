Melanie Sykes recently revealed that she follows an intense daily regime of sit-ups, crunches and Russian twists to keep her body in peak physical condition.

And judging by her enviable physique in her latest lingerie shoot, all that hard work has certainly been paying off.

The 43-year-old TV presenter looks flawless in her second campaign for luxury lingerie brand Adore Moi by Ultimo.

Bewitching: Melanie Sykes shows off the body she has worked hard to achieve in her latest lingerie shoot for Ultimo

Dressed in suspenders, stockings and a retro, veiled hat, the mother-of-two looks every inch the glamorous model in the sexy winter campaign, which was shot by famed celebrity photographer, Dan Kennedy.

The new collection, which is available exclusively at Debenhams from today, includes a show-stopping red lace corset and suspender range, and a charcoal-grey satin balconette bra and matching thong.

Created from a love of embroidery, lace and fine detailing, Adore Moi by Ultimo aims to channel a  French boudoir feel. Prices start from £8 for briefs and £22.50 for bras.

Speaking about her latest shoot, Melanie - who shot to fame after starring in a Boddingtons advert in the mid-90s - said: 'The new Adore Moi by Ultimo collection is absolutely stunning - super luxurious, yet incredibly affordable, and it fits like a glove.

'I love getting dressed up in beautiful lingerie, there’s nothing sexier. I always wear matching underwear, but if you want to really vamp it up there’s nothing better than a gorgeous corset and stockings.'

Michelle Mone OBE, founder of Ultimo, said: 'Melanie represents everything Adore Moi by Ultimo stands for – grown up, beautiful and confident. The new range is extremely luxurious and sophisticated, women are going to love it!'.

The mother-of-two recently told MailOnline that she barely drinks any alcohol and has a 'low-ish' carbohydrate intake to keep her figure in check.

Sykes was unveiled as the new face and incredibly toned body of 
Ultimo's Adore Moi range in October and achieved her killer body through a rigorous
exercise regime

She also swears by Active Woman Refine - tablets that describe themselves as 'fat torching' capsules.

The tablets claim to be packed with 
essential fat-fighting nutrients like CLA (a natural omega acid that 
targets fat deposits for conversion into energy) as well as yerba mate (a Latin American tea), 
green tea extract and L-carnitine, which aim to reduce body fat while 
increasing muscle.

Melanie says she takes two tablets daily in conjunction with her fitness regime.

Her final golden rule is commitment. 

The star has previously opened up about how she maintains her incredible figure, telling MailOnline: 'On a good week if I'm not working I
get in the gym between three and five times a week, an hour a time.

'I
started training about four years ago. I was approaching 40 and just 
thought it would be quite good to get fit... I was slim, but it wasn't 
about that, it was about getting a bit fitter.'

Melanie joins Michael Buble's pregnant wife Luisana Lopilato as a face of the underwear brand.

Former models for the range have included supermodel Helena Christensen, TV Presenter Jenni Falconer and Kimberley Stewart.
