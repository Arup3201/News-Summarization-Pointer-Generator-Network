As one striker was on his way out of QPR, another was announcing himself with his first-ever Barclays Premier League goal.

Loic Remy was pulled out of QPR’s squad by manager Harry Redknapp at the last minute after a bid from Chelsea triggered his £10.5million release clause.

But while Remy was busy negotiating a deal with Chelsea, Austin stepped up to rattle in a shot from close range for QPR’s first win of the season.

MOTM: Fer

The 25-year-old has come a long way from non-League Kintbury in Berkshire and if his scoring record up until this point is anything to go by, there will be many more goals to come.

Redknapp said afterwards: ‘Hopefully he can be like Rickie Lambert for us. A lot of strikers have come out of the lower leagues: Les Ferdinand, Ian Wright, Ian Rush. I’m sure Charlie will score at this level.’

Redknapp’s phone rang in his post-match press conference. ‘It’s Charlie Austin’s grandad,’ he added, laughing. ‘He’ll be proud.’

In first-half stoppage time Austin finally provided the game with the goal it was screaming out for. Joey Barton sent in a corner from the left which was nodded down and back by Leroy Fer and smashed in first-time by Austin.

It was a marvel that the match had not had a goal before that. Fer, an £8million signing from Norwich, rattled the crossbar with a 25-yard scorcher on 31 minutes, hit so powerfully there could have been tremors felt in the School End behind the goal.

The game was played at a frenetic pace right from the start. Sunderland’s Connor Wickham had to clear Austin’s header off the line in the third minute and, moments before he scored, Austin was close again.

Fer picked him out with a pass and his first touch beat John O’Shea, but when he tried to round Vito Mannone, the Sunderland goalkeeper dived at his feet and took ball and man. 

QPR squeezed the pressure as half-time approached and Matt Phillips had a volley blocked before Steven Caulker headed just wide, just before Austin opened the scoring. But it was not all one-way traffic and Adam Johnson was busy threading passes from midfield. On 11 minutes he slipped in Steven Fletcher and QPR goalkeeper Rob Green had to dive low to save the striker’s effort. Seven minutes later he put in left-back Patrick van Aanholt who had raced forward from the back, but his first-time shot curled just over. 

Finish: Austin was making his first appearance since picking up an injury in the 1-0 defeat away to Hull a fortnight ago

Relief: Austin's goal put the Hoops on track for their first win of the season after a run of three straight defeats, including the League Cup humiliation at Burton

Chances galore turned into frustration in the second half. Not that Redknapp would have minded.

Sunderland initially made tentative efforts to get an equaliser, wary of conceding the killer goal. Jack Rodwell hustled and bustled in the box and got a shot away in the 52nd minute but Green put his body behind the ball.

Two minutes later Santiago Vergini drilled an effort from inside the box and Green was down sharply to save again.

Sunderland finally pushed hard for an equaliser in the final 10 minutes. Clint Hill blocked a cut back from Johnson on the right and, only four yards from goal, somehow diverted the ball over the bar and substitute Emanuele Giaccherini hit a rocket which Green leapt back to keep out.

‘We are not enough, we know the numbers I want to work with,’ Sunderland manager Gus Poyet complained.

‘I am going to be on the phone all the time. Sunday is supposed to be a day off. I am not a fan of the window open during the season.’
