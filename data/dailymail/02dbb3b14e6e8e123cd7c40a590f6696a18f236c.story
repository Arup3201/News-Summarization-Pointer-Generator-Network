Marked man: 'Jihadi John', the Islamic State militant who has murdered several Western hostages, is being hunted by British intelligence 

David Cameron has told British spy chiefs to track down Islamic State executioner 'Jihadi John' so that special forces can move in to get him dead or alive, it was claimed today.

Mr Cameron summoned the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ to Chequers, his country residence, to tell them hunting down the UK-born militant is now their top priority, according to reports.

The new orders come after friends and relatives of Alan Henning, the British aid worker executed by the militants last week, accused the government of not doing enough to secure his release.

Just 12 hours after the video apparently showing Mr Henning's murder was published online, spy chiefs gathered at Chequers to brief Mr Cameron on what they know, the Sunday Times reports.

According to the paper, intelligence chiefs told the Prime Minister that information on the whereabouts of the militants is not yet reliable enough to launch a special forces raid.

Citing unnamed sources, it claimed intelligence agencies were 'working around the clock' to locate Jihadi John and his comrades, with the majority of MI5's efforts now directed at the threat from Syria.

The report contradicted claims made in the Mail On Sunday, according to which Jihadi John had been tracked to the Syrian city of Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold.

U.S. Reaper drones flying high over the city in north-east Syria were said to have not only spotted the militant, whose face is covered when he appears in videos, but also hostages wearing orange jumpsuits.

But, the report claims, military chiefs have ruled out a rescue operation because Islamic State defences are too strong. Special Forces bosses have instead advised the Ministry of Defence that a sustained bombing campaign lasting several weeks would be preferable, it says.

A source said: ‘The imagery from the drones and satellites is instructive but IS infrastructure in Raqqa would have to be targeted over a sustained period to make any sort of raid a realistic possibility.

‘On the basis of our current advice there is very little chance of the Prime Minister signing off a rescue bid. The prospect of success has got to be 100 per cent or thereabouts, and at the moment it is nowhere near that. And for now there are not many other options on the table.

'While sightings of Jihadi John are useful, as was establishing his identity, we are still a long way off getting a hit on him. Right now a raid would be suicidal.’

It is not clear which report is most reliable, but last night, after his meeting with intelligence chiefs, Mr Cameron indicated he would be willing to deploy special forces units such as the Special Air Service (SAS).

'The murder of Alan Henning was absolutely appalling,' he said. 'It is senseless; it's completely unforgivable. Anyone in any doubt about this organisation can now see how truly repulsive it is and barbaric it is as an organisation.

'What we see with this organisation is that there is no level of depravity to which they will not sink. The fact that this was a kind, gentle, compassionate and caring man who had simply gone to help others, the fact they could murder him in the way they did shows what we are dealing with.

'We must do everything we can to defeat this organisation. We must take action against it and we must find those responsible.'

British intelligence and security agencies are already working closely with the FBI and CIA to find Jihadi John and his group of kidnappers in what is now a high-profile murder and counter-terrorism investigation.

MI5 and Scotland Yard, aided by GCHQ communication monitoring, have identified the British man believed to have carried out the beheadings of two American journalists and two British aid workers.

This information has been shared with a team of more than a dozen US investigators from an FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, from the US agency’s counter-terrorism command, who are reported to have flown to the UK in the past few weeks.

The jihadi nicknamed ‘John’ by the hostages he was holding – because he and the other British jihadis were known as The Beatles – is understood to come from a suburb of South London. It is believed his family members have been interviewed by Met officers and an FBI agent.

Meanwhile, teams from MI6 and CIA have deployed field officers in Northern Syria to help pinpoint the exact location of the group of kidnappers. These teams have picked up valuable intelligence gathered by their agents operating within IS ranks.

The US Senate has offered a £6million reward for any information that will lead to the capture of ‘John’.
