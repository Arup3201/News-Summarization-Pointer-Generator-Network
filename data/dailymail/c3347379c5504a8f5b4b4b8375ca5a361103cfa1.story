A boy of 15 sat laughing beside his mother in the dock yesterday as he was jailed for the ‘primeval’ murder of a market trader.

Karlton Burton grinned and shouted ‘see ya guys’ when he was led down to the cells after being convicted of stabbing Rashid Naeem to death.

He and his accomplice, Javauntee Campbell, stole two watches from Mr Naeem’s street stall, taunting the 29-year-old father of two with the words: ‘Are you scared?’

When Mr Naeem confronted them, Burton knifed him in the heart in front of shoppers and terrified children. Campbell, 16, pushed the trader to the ground and punched his brother Sajid.

The pair ran off, leaving their victim bleeding heavily. He died in hospital.

Burton, who was associated with gangs, was on bail at the time for attacking a rival’s car with an axe.

Yesterday Judge Richard Hone QC allowed him to sit next to his mother in the Old Bailey dock for her to try to control his behaviour. He is said to have an attention deficit disorder and the maturity of an 11-year-old.

Despite the special measures, the thug, who is obsessed with knives and computer games such as Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, continued to laugh, whispering to his mother and calling out to his friends in the public gallery.

The judge sentenced Burton to life imprisonment with a minimum of 15 years, saying: ‘You were aged just 14 when you committed the murder of Rashid Naeem.

‘By your actions that Sunday you have in effect passed a life sentence on all the members of your victim’s close and devoted family. Rashid Naeem has two young children who will never again see their father. The pain and devastation you have caused to all these people is beyond description.

‘In that primeval second of anger and stabbing there is probably no distinction between an intent to really seriously injure with a knife, and an intention to kill.’

Judge Hone said Burton had orchestrated the attack on Mr Naeem in ‘retaliation for some perceived disrespect’. He added: ‘This offence was committed in a Sunday public market with families and children present. You have a background which includes associating with gangs carrying knives.

Police made history by charging three boys with murder before the victim had died, one has been cleared

‘There is a really bad streak in your character which means you overreact to perceived insults.’ The court heard Burton’s mother feared that he was turning into a gangster and she had struggled to control his behaviour.

On February 16, Burton, Campbell and a 15-year-old boy who cannot be named, approached Mr Naeem’s stall in Queens Market in East Ham, East London, where he sold used mobile phones, watches and clocks.

When the trader nervously moved his phones into a display box, Burton taunted him and, with Campbell, grabbed two watches and made off with the other boy.

Campbell handed his watch back but a few minutes later the boys were captured on CCTV returning to the stall.

As Mr Naeem and his brother approached the defendants, Burton reached down to his ankle and withdrew a knife from his sock, concealing it in his jacket.

When he was asked to return the watch, Burton stabbed Mr Naeem in the chest.

In a legal first, all three boys were charged with murder even before Mr Naeem had died because doctors said he could not survive his injuries. Scotland Yard issued an extraordinary statement saying: ‘His injuries will prove fatal and consequently the three youths have been accused of murder.’

Just a few hours later, Mr Naeem’s life support machine was switched off at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel.

At a trial in July, Burton was convicted of murder and possession of a knife while Campbell was convicted of manslaughter. The third boy was cleared of murder.

Campbell, who appeared in court by video link from Feltham Prison, showed no reaction as he was sentenced to ten years in a young offenders institution.

He will serve half his term before being released on licence.

The court heard he had been led astray by Burton who had pictures of a knife and suspected drugs on his Facebook page.

Giving evidence in his defence, Campbell said: ‘I asked him [Burton] “Did you poke the guy?” He said “No I don’t think so, it did not go in”.’

Burton claimed he had been acting in self-defence, a plea which was rejected by the jury.
