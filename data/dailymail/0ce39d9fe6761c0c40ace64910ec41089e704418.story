Calling to book a table, make a doctor's appointment or phoning for help when stranded at the side of the road are tasks many people  take for granted.

But for the deaf, simple tasks like these typically require expensive equipment or a mediator - until now. 

The Pedius app was created to help deaf people speak to friends, family and businesses on the phone using voice recognition and real-time speech translation.

Pedius (pictured)  uses voice recognition and speech translation to make calls more natural. When a call is made using the app the user types a message on the screen. This is translated to speech in real time, so the recipient can 'hear' them. The recipient's spoken response is then immediately translated into text

When a call is made using the free Android or iOS app, the user types a message on the screen.

This is translated to speech in real time, so the recipient can hear the request or conversation.Their spoken response is then immediately translated into text.

Pedius was developed by Italian entrepreneur Lorenzo Di Ciaccio after he heard a story about a deaf man whose car had broken down.

The driver was unable to communicate by phone and was left waiting for hours hoping someone would notice and help him.

Last year a visually impaired developer from Denmark  launched an app designed to help blind people 'see'.

The free Be My Eyes app connects blind people to a sighted volunteer using a live video chat. 

The volunteer can then answer questions and see the blind person's surroundings using a phone's camera.

Be My Eyes takes advantage of an iPhone feature called VoiceOver.

This lets people who are completely blind use the device using synthetic speech and a touch-based interface.

Pedius does not require both users to have specific hardware, and all communications and interactions are private.

If the voice transcription is not accurate enough, Pedius automatically shows alternatives, and if it's still not enough, a user can ask the recipient to repeat themselves using the 'R' button.

Users can additionally record messages using their own voice by pressing the microphone button.

Although the app is free, calls cost 15p per minute when made in the UK, Italy and Ireland and users need to add credit to the account to make these calls. 

A typical top-up starts at £3.99, but credit packages are also available in £5, £10, £20 and £50 bundles.

From next month, users will also be given 20 free minutes every month.

Pedius launched in Italy in 2013 and is now available in the UK, US and France. The firm plans to expand further into Europe later this year. 

'Being able to make a simple phone call is something we often take for granted,' said Mr Di Ciaccio.

'There are over 70 million people in the world who have profound to severe hearing loss and are unable to use phones.

Earlier this year Google released an audio translation function for its Translate app. 

Transcription experts at Verbalink recently tested the tool's accuracy when compared to human translators. 

For the first test, Google Translate and a translator called Adriana were asked to translate a promotional document about Argentina’s National Beekeeping Council from Spanish into English. 

For the second test, both had to translate a minute of Spanish audio into English.

For both document and audio translation, Google was able to capture the 'overall gist' of the content and Verbalink said it would be useful for quick, general understanding. 

Transcription experts at Verbalink recently tested Google Translate's accuracy when compared to human translators (pictured). Google’s translations 'were too raw to be used for any professional purpose, and readability was often compromised by poor word choices and questionable grammar', explained the firm

But Verbalink added that Google’s translations 'were too raw to be used for any professional purpose, and readability was often compromised by poor word choices and questionable grammar'.

In the second test, for example, Google failed to translate the word 'ya ya'.

Adriana had a higher degree of overall accuracy and a greater ability to capture the tone and style of the original documents.  

By being able to  consider the subject matter, context, and target audience, Adriana's translations sounded more natural.

'Of course, a human translator won’t fit in your pocket, and they may not always be able to accompany you to that very authentic Thai restaurant or overseas vacation,' explained Verbalink. 

'When you need immediate results, and they don’t have to be perfect, it’s OK to use Google Translate.

'[But] for any sort of business or commercial documents, or anything that has to be precise, it’s best to stick with human translators.' 

'A smartphone is something most people have, so Pedius is designed to help make everyday life easier by offering a more accessible way to communicate whenever they like over the phone.' 

Last year a visually impaired developer from Denmark  launched a similar app designed to help blind people 'see'.

The Be My Eyes app connects blind people to a sighted volunteer using a live video chat. 

The volunteer can then answer questions and see the blind person's surroundings using a phone's camera.

Be My Eyes takes advantage of an iPhone feature called VoiceOver. This lets people who are completely blind use the device using synthetic speech and a touch-based interface. 

The app is currently only available for people using an iPhone 4S or above, running iOS 7. 

A similar app called Be My Eyes takes advantage of an iPhone feature called VoiceOver, to help blind people use the device with synthetic speech. To ask for help, a blind person opens the app and requests assistance. This can be anything from knowing the expiry date on the milk (pictured), to navigating new surroundings
