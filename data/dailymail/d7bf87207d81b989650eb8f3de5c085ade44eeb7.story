Scottish viewers could lose access to some BBC programmes if they decide to leave the UK in this year’s referendum, the Culture Secretary warned yesterday.

In a riposte to Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond – who has promised Scots would keep programmes such as Strictly Come Dancing and EastEnders under independence – Maria Miller insisted the Corporation belongs to the UK as a whole.

The cabinet minister was asked at the Oxford Media Convention whether the BBC should shut down its Scottish transmitters in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote.

She replied: ‘When it comes to voting in September I think we have to think what that vote is about.

‘It’s about whether or not Scotland wants to remain a part of the UK, and if the vote is they don’t want to do that then it’s actually a vote to leave the institutions of the UK and the BBC is one of those institutions.’

Mrs Miller said she could not yet give any detail on what television would be available in an independent Scotland.

But she added: ‘I think it’s important that that principle is clear and that it is part of the decision making process when it comes to the referendum.’

In November, the Scottish Government published a White Paper that promised a new Scottish Broadcasting Service – using the BBC’s assets in Scotland – would continue to air BBC programmes.

It said viewers would benefit from similar deals to those in force in the Republic of Ireland, where many BBC shows are screened on local channels.

The White Paper said: ‘This will ensure that the people of Scotland will still have access to all current programming, including EastEnders, Doctor Who, and Strictly Come Dancing and to channels like CBeebies.’

Mr Salmond said a Scottish public service broadcaster would be ‘based on the existing staff and assets of BBC Scotland.’

'We have to see': BBC director general Tony Hall refused to speculate on the future of the BBC in Scotland

Speaking at the same event, the BBC’s director general Tony Hall refused to speculate on the future of the BBC in Scotland. He said: ‘My view is we have to see.

'It is flattering for the BBC to be part of the Crown Jewels that people talk about around the Scottish independence vote'

‘It is flattering for the BBC to be part of the Crown Jewels that people talk about around the Scottish independence vote. But we will wait and see when the polls come through on September 18.

‘What I’m concentrating on the moment is that journalists who are covering the story have got my backing to be impartial and independent and to cover this campaign in Scotland, and really importantly in the rest of the UK, the best they can.’
