On and off the pitch there is perhaps one word which best describes Jonas Gutierrez – genuine.

Shortly before meeting him for the first time, I was warned – albeit with a smile – that I would hear him before I saw him. It was true.

That was in July, 2008 and he had just signed for Newcastle from Real Mallorca. I interviewed him at the club’s training ground and there was no need for an interpreter, Jonas insisting from the off that he used English.

Newcastle's Jonas Gutierrez has been battling testicular cancer and the chemotherapy has caused hair loss

The first thing that strikes you is his gregarious nature, he’s larger than life but endearing and infectious with it.

It was, then, a shock to learn of his battle with testicular cancer and to see the TV interview in which Jonas – wearing a baseball cap having lost his hair following chemotherapy – revealed his illness.

For while we all know that cancer does not discriminate, here was a supreme athlete once nicknamed El Galgo – The Greyhound – for his indefatigable efforts on the field.

But when he arrived at Newcastle it was the moniker ‘Spiderman’ we were all talking about. 

During his time at Mallorca, Jonas, after a visit to the cinema to see Spiderman, had promised a boy he would don the superhero’s mask the next time he scored a goal.

And so he duly did, producing the disguise from his shorts following a solo strike against Osasuna.

The Argentine midfielder is known for his gregarious, larger-than-life personality that is hard to dislike

Type ‘Spidey Jonas’ into YouTube and enjoy it for yourselves, you’ll see what I mean about his fun-loving nature from the celebration as he mimics spinning a web.

One person who certainly thought Jonas was a superhero was my own mam. Following a pre-season friendly against PSV in the summer he signed, I interviewed Jonas pitchside. Kevin Keegan was manager and he’d invited my family – waiting for me in the stands – down to the dugout area to watch me perform.

After the interview I introduced Jonas to my parents, shaking my dad warmly by the hand and giving my mam a kiss on either cheek. It was then that we realised her shoe was caught in the drain on the fringe of the pitch. Without further notice Jonas was down on all fours manoeuvring the shoe back and forth in a bid to free it. Thirty seconds and two more kisses later we were all on our way. He’d even signed the matchday programmes of which he was the cover star.

In fact, I have never seen Jonas refuse an autograph or an interview. His willingness to engage with team-mates, press and supporters made him instantly popular on Tyneside.

Gutierrez was loaned out to Norwich last season but they were relegated from the Premier League

He backed it up on a Saturday afternoon as well. He was so impressive on his debut at Manchester United – a 1-1 draw – that Alan Hansen said on Match of the Day that he could be the signing of the season.

Sadly, with Keegan gone before the month was out, Newcastle were ultimately relegated. Gutierrez, though, stayed and played a key role in the club regaining their top-flight status – there was also the long-awaited appearance of the Spiderman mask at St James’ Park following a fine goal against Peterborough. It had been in his shorts for over a year!

It was during the Championship season that his best friend and Argentinian compatriot, Fabricio Coloccini, scored one of his first goals for the club at Watford.

In 2008, Alan Hansen said on Match of the Day that Gutierrez could be the signing of the season

As we waited to speak to the scorer – who still hadn’t emerged from the dressing-room – we noticed the team bus starting its engine. Taking matters into our own hands, we entered the crumbling changing quarters of Vicarage Road to be met by the sight of Jonas and Coloccini - still wrapped in their towels and the last two present – enjoying the beats of their infamous (the other players occasionally took the mickey) Latin sounds. Rather than chase us, Jonas offered to play the role of interpreter and so Coloccini gave his first interview to the press as a Newcastle player.

When Jonas revealed his cancer treatment he, of course, spoke fondly of Coloccini, thanking him for his support.

And in the hours since, thousands of fans, team-mates and sportsmen from around the world have come out and offered their thoughts and support to Jonas and his family.

That is the reason for a few of the above personal recollections, hopefully illustrating in a small way what a genuine guy he really is.

Get well soon, Jonas.
