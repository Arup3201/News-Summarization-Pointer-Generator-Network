Chris Robshaw insists England are better prepared than two years ago when they pulled off a shock victory over the All Blacks at Twickenham that ended the tourists’ 20-game winning streak.

England were less than a year into Stuart Lancaster’s tenure as head coach when they shocked the world champions with a stunning 38-21 win and, despite a raft of injuries ahead of Saturday’s showdown, Robshaw believes his side are much improved.

‘I think we have come a long way since then,’ said the England captain. ‘We were a side that was very defence-orientated and we prided ourselves on that defence. We probably won a lot of games because of that.

‘I think we have come a long way since then,’ said the England captain. ‘We were a side that was very defence-orientated and we prided ourselves on that defence. We probably won a lot of games because of that.

‘Our attack has now caught up with that. Now we can play both sides. We can threaten with our attack and have that dominant defence as well.

‘The experience and composure of the guys has come on a long way. There were a lot of single-figure caps back then. Guys have now been round the world and played in some intimidating arenas, and excelled there.’

Robshaw also sent out a warning to his team-mates saying there will be 'no hiding places' against New Zealand. 

He added: 'There's no hiding place. We're not going into this game to come out second best. You can't stand off these guys for a second. It's about us putting our game out there.

'You have to defend extremely well and take your chances - there is no magic formula to beating them.

'In the pressure of the situation it's about who is able to do that and keep their composure. It's about being clinical.

'In international rugby you know you're going to get a couple of chances, but in international rugby, when everything is flying around, are we good enough to take our chances?

'As an England squad that's the next step we need to take if we really want to push ourselves up there.

'We need to be as clinical as these guys coming to town this weekend. They are the benchmark of world rugby. Playing them is a great way to kick-start the autumn.'

Lancaster will name his side on Thursday with uncapped Fijian-born wing Semesa Rokoduguni expected to be named alongside a midfield containing Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt.

Saracens centre Brad Barritt is expected to return to the England XV to earn his 17th cap on Saturday
