A student has written a touching email thanking another teenage boy from a rival school after he fell to the ground during a 'nightmarish' cross country competition and was helped up and supported by the boy until he completed the race.

Oliver, 17, from St Joseph's College Gregory Terrace in Brisbane, didn't get a chance to thank the student he knew only as 'Jack' from Ipswich Grammar School in southeast Queensland.

But after Jack had sacrificed his place in the race and stayed with him, at times physically supporting him, Oliver was so surprised by Jack's level of sportsmanship that he wrote a long email expressing his thanks to Ipswich Grammar's principal Robert Henderson.

Jack Chivers, from Ipswich Grammar School, sacrificed his place in the race in order to stay with Oliver, from St Joseph's College Gregory Terrace, and help him get across the finish line

'I am writing to you to express my most humble and sincere gratitude and thanks to one of your year 12 students,' Oliver wrote about his encounter with Jack at the  GPS Cross Country Championships in Queensland on June 4.

'I had what could probably be described as a nightmarish experience when, about 4 kilometres into the 6 kilometre race, I collapsed on the ground, due to a combination of dehydration, exhaustion and heatstroke.

Oliver explained that after being given the all clear from a medical team he continued on, 'desperately wanting to finish the race'.

'Very soon, towards the bottom of what we refer to as "Heartbreak" Hill, I was joined by a student of your school who was also competing,' Oliver's email continued.

'Realising I was in distress, he began to give me encouragement, support and I believe slowed down considerably to stay with me.

'Before I crossed the line, I fell twice more – each time, he stopped and helped me get back up and continue – at times physically supporting me, holding onto my arm.'

Oliver first collapsed about 4 km into the 6 km race, due to a combination of dehydration, exhaustion and heatstroke

'This came to a head in the last 200 meters, when he displayed an incredible amount of selflessness and remained with me right until the finish line – evidently not concerned with finishing ahead of or faster than me.'

Oliver added that he hoped Jack's story was shared and that received the acknowledgement he deserved.

'I can't help but feel that we would be much better off with more young men like him.

'Perhaps in the heat of the moment, he didn't realise the impact he had had on me, but in a time when I was at my most vulnerable, he showed myself and the crowd of onlookers that sometimes, the result isn't important - it's about the respect and brotherhood that comes about from schoolboy sport.

'I continue to be in awe of his actions.'

Jack told MailOnline he had read the email and thought it was 'very nice but probably a bit unnecessary'

The boy, who has since been identified at 17-year-old Jack Chivers, told MailOnline he had read the email and thought it was 'very nice but probably a bit unnecessary'.

'I don't even understand really. It's very surprising,' he said.

Jack said he was a bit confused about the interest in his act of sportsmanship, after it was mentioned at school assemblies, run in the school newsletter and shared online.

'One of my teachers at school said there's quite a lot of competition around the GPS events and it was quite nice to hear that someone had something more sportsmanlike than trying to get ahead,' he said.

'I saw him quite a few times he was almost falling over, we were at the bottom of what a lot of people call Heartbreak Hill and he was not looking good so I just said "Hi" and wanted to give him a bit of encouragement.

Oliver said he hoped Jack's story was shared and that received the acknowledgement he deserved

'You think anyone… I hope they would do the same thing in my situation.'

Jack said he hadn't spoken to Oliver since the race but he would like to.

'My head teacher told me he was in hospital. I would definitely be asking about that,' he said.

'He had some sort of appendix problem, I don't know if that contributed to his race issue.'

Jack's principal Mr Henderson said Jack was a 'ripper young man'.

'He's very quiet and unassuming,' he said.

'He's a very nice young man and he just noticed another young man being quite distressed and was keen to go to his aid.'

Dear Mr Henderson and Mr Hardy,

I am writing to you to express my most humble and sincere gratitude and thanks to one of your year 12 students, in the hope that it may be passed on and his actions recognised in light of what happened between him and I at the recent GPS Cross Country Championships on June 4 (last Wednesday as I write).

As an open runner in year 12 who has represented Terrace at the championships for the last 5 years, I had what could probably be described as a nightmarish experience when, about 4 kilometres into the 6 kilometre race, I collapsed on the ground, due to a combination of dehydration, exhaustion and heatstroke.

I lay there for about 5 minutes (although thankfully there were coaches on hand) until a medical buggy arrived. After being cleared by the medico, and desperately wanting to finish the race, I got up and continued to complete the course. At this point, only 2 runners in the opens race had yet to pass where I had been.

Very soon, towards the bottom of what we refer to as 'heartbreak' hill, I was joined by a student of your school who was also competing.

Realising I was in distress, he began to give me encouragement, support and I believe slowed down considerably to stay with me. This continued to the top of the hill, and right until the finish. Before I crossed the line, I fell twice more – each time, he stopped and helped me get back up and continue – at times physically supporting me, holding onto my arm.

This came to a head in the last 200 meters, when he displayed an incredible amount of selflessness and remained with me right until the finish line – evidently not concerned with finishing ahead of or faster than me. I finished with him, and unfortunately I didn't get the opportunity to express my thanks as he disappeared into the crowd. All I caught at the time was his name – Jack – but I can honestly say that his actions represented the most sportsmanlike and rare example of character I have ever witnessed in a person. Finishing that race was probably one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, but I certainly would have failed without him.

After a bit of searching, I found that his name was Jack Chivers, and that GPS had been his first race of the season. The lengths I went to make contact with him were unsuccessful in the days following. I simply want to express what a fine representative of Ipswich Grammar School that Jack was – what was probably my first ever interaction with one of your students is one which I doubt I will forget for a long, long time.

I would hope that his story is shared and that he receives the plaudits and acknowledgement he deserves, because I can't help but feel that we would be much better off with more young men like him. Perhaps in the heat of the moment, he didn't realise the impact he had had on me, but in a time when I was at my most vulnerable, he showed myself and the crowd of onlookers that sometimes, the result isn't important - it's about the respect and brotherhood that comes about from schoolboy sport. I continue to be in awe of his actions.

I still would love to be able to thank Jack personally, but until I could do that, I simply felt compelled to retell his story to yourselves.

Sincere Regards,

OliverGregory Terrace, Year 12
