After the celebration comes the hangover — or at least a sober analysis of Arsenal’s standing in Europe.

Having chosen Arsene Wenger’s 65th birthday to stage one of the most dramatic and unlikely comebacks in the manager’s 18 years at the club, his team might have been tempted to raise a glass to their fortitude and spirit as they flew back from Brussels on Wednesday night.

However, the euphoria of such an astonishing turnaround against Anderlecht, with goals from Kieran Gibbs and Lukas Podolski in the last two minutes keeping them on course for the knockout stages, could not mask the previous 88 which had exposed their European pretensions.

And at least Per Mertesacker, captain for the evening, was not in the mood to soft-pedal his analysis of the performance. 

Sunderland on Saturday may be licking their wounds from an 8-0 defeat at Southampton, but Arsenal are hardly firing on all cylinders.

‘The last five minutes were great,’ said the German World Cup winner. 

‘For 85 minutes we lacked a bit of everything. We are just pleased with the last five minutes and our finishing. Everyone knows that it is a difficult start to the season for us, and confidence is not how we want it.

'The character is good and the mentality is good. But football-wise we lack a few things. The passing game is not as efficient as last year. We are not at our best. We have to be honest with ourselves and train harder.

‘We have to do better with our own possession, to put more pressure on the opposition, not to lose so many balls in the middle of the park, to play more in wide areas. 

'It is better to expose them there, instead of playing one-twos through the middle. It doesn’t work as much as last season, so we have to work on that.’

What can be said is that Arsenal are forging an indomitable spirit. They don’t lose much now and late comebacks are becoming a trait. Goals in the 90th minute have secured wins against Crystal Palace and Anderlecht and draws against Everton and Hull.

But prior to the late intervention of Gibbs and Podolski, Arsenal were being given the runaround. Their lack of defensive cover and the frequent inability of the midfield to impose itself are well recorded. Up front, Alexis Sanchez looked a threat but Danny Welbeck faded.

Thankfully for Arsenal, Podolski made the most of a rare outing. Mertesacker said: ‘He is in a difficult period but he showed how vital he is. You can wake him up any second in the day and he will score with his left foot. That is a quality we need.’
