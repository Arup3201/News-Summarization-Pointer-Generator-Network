A little girl who had a crippling fear of dogs has overcome her phobia after being hypnotised, and now, she has a puppy of her own.

Rebekah Kirby, 11, was so afraid of dogs she refused to leave the house in case she saw one.

She developed the phobia after she was chased down the street by a neighbour’s poodle when she was three.

The schoolgirl from Hull was so scared the would physically shake and cry if she saw a dog - and was so terrified her mother, Louise, was forced to cancel trips to the beach and family camping holidays in case they came into contact with a pooch.

Mrs Kirby, 38, was desperate to let her daughter live a normal life - and resorted to having Rebekah hypnotised to help her overcome her fear.

After just a few sessions, Rebekah is completely over her fear - and even has a puppy of her own.

Mrs Kirby said: 'It used to break my heart when I saw other children out playing and Rebekah inside because she was too afraid.

'Rebekah’s friends would invite her around to dinner but she wouldn’t ever go as she was too afraid of any dogs being there.

'It became so bad she would worry about leaving the house and her fear really had a big impact upon her life.'

Rebekah's phobia was so bad that she would refuse to leave the house in case she saw a dog and would not go to friends' houses in case they had one. Her parents also had to cancel holidays in case they saw one

Rebekah’s fear only became worse with age, and despite the support of Mrs Kirby, and husband Paul, nothing seemed to help.

When Mrs Kirby gave birth to William, now seven, she soon realised how much the little boy longed for a family pet.

She said: 'William has always been fine with dogs and was desperate for a puppy of his own but with Rebekah’s phobia, it just wasn’t possible.

Hypnotherapy is a type of complementary therapy that uses hypnosis - an altered state of consciousness.

No one really knows how it works - some people think it relies on the placebo effect while others think it is the relaxation involved that helps.

It can sometimes be used to treat IBS, skin conditions and anxiety.

It has also been used to help people lose weight or stop smoking.

Currently the NHS says there is no firm evidence to suggest it works.

'This was when Rebekah realised something had to change. She couldn’t keep living her life isolated from other children her age. She was missing out on playing with her friends and she didn’t want her feeling about dogs to start affecting her younger brother’s feelings.'

Mrs Kirby decided to take Rebekah to see a hypnotherapist called Richard Scott.

She paid £140 for a session with Mr Scott, where he spoke to Rebekah about her fears and gave her a CD to listen to at night.

Mrs Kirby said: 'I was sceptical at first but I had run out of options. I just wanted to help Rebekah before she became any older and her situation worsened.

'After just a week Rebekah was already changing and starting to feel less anxious about the thought of being around dogs.'

Mrs
 Kirby was astounded at the change in Rebekah and when she suggested 
visiting a family friend who had a dog, astonishingly Rebekah agreed.

She
 said: 'I could not believe it when she agreed to come too. It was 
something she was petrified of before, but once we arrived she actually 
managed to stroke a dog for the first time - though the garden gate.'

And just weeks after finishing her course of hypnotherapy, the family have now bought Rebekah a puppy of her own, 10-month-old Vinnie, a Shar Pei.

Mrs Kirby said: 'Rebekah and Vinnie are best friends. She loves him so much and her brother Will is delighted to have the dog he always wanted.

'Rebekah spends her days teaching Vinnie tricks and cuddling him. Everyone who knows her just cannot believe the change in her.

'Vinnie has completed our family and I am so happy that Rebekah can get on with her life now, without fearing dogs.

Rebekah only needed a few sessions of hypnotherapy before she was cured of her phobia

'Vinnie makes her so happy and he has helped her develop her confidence. She loves him more than anything and it is heart-warming to see.'

Hypnotist Mr Scott said: 'Rebekah had a very acute fear of dogs when I first met her, which had a big impact on her life.

'I’m really pleased I was able to help her and her family, and it’s lovely to see her playing with her new puppy now.'
