Hours after revealing she had cancer, actress Lynda Bellingham reassured fans by telling them: ‘I’m not going to die’.

The 65-year-old, known for her roles on Loose Women and in Oxo TV adverts, has had to postpone a theatre tour during her treatment.

Her family has released no further details of her condition.

Yesterday morning she told fans she was on the road to recovery with a message on social networking site Twitter.

She wrote: ‘Hi everyone just to say I 
have been diagnosed with cancer but I am not going to die! Dealing with 
it and hope to be back at work soon.’

She had earlier said that she was 
‘devastated’ not to take part in Kay Mellor’s A Passionate Woman.

In a 
statement on Monday night, she said: ‘I’m devastated not to be able to 
honour my commitments to the play this year.

'But having toured many 
times before, I’m aware of the sheer stamina needed and I need to 
prioritise my recovery.’

She added: ‘That said, nothing’s going to stop me coming back next year, and I can’t wait to be “a passionate woman”.’

Miss Bellingham rose to fame as the 
mother of a squabbling family in a long-running series of Oxo stock cube
adverts in the Eighties. Her roles include parts in All Creatures Great
and Small and the sitcom Second Thoughts, which began on BBC Radio 4 
before moving to ITV.

She presents ITV series Country House Sunday and was a panellist on ITV talk show Loose Women.

She appeared as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing.

A Passionate Woman was due to begin at the Sheffield Lyceum in September.

The mother of two, who married Spanish mortgage broker Michael Pattemore – her third husband – on her 60th birthday in 2008, also plans to release a novel called Tell Me Tomorrow in August.

Two years ago she revealed she had battled alcoholism and domestic violence.

A violent marriage, marred by verbal and physical abuse, caused her to find solice in alcohol, and she decided in 2006 that she would cut it from her life completely.

In 2007 she admitted to her Loose Women colleagues that she was drinking more than she should have after her second marriage, to restauranteur Nunzio Peluso, broke down.

He regularly assaulted and emotionally tortured her during their 16-year marriage, and then conducted a two-year campaign of harassment after their divorce which was only ended by a 1999 court case, a £4,000 fine and a restraining order preventing him coming near the home she shared with their two sons, Michael and Robbie.

A Passionate Woman was due to start its run at the Sheffield Lyceum in September.

The theatre’s artistic director 
Daniel Evans last night said: 'A Passionate Woman is an extraordinary 
play about an extraordinary woman, and that woman is Lynda Bellingham.

‘She is the heart of this production, and it’s inconceivable that we would do it without her.

'Our priority is to Lynda and her health and we look forward to welcoming her back soon.'

Ms Bellingham was close friends with Nolans singer Bernie Nolan, who died of cancer this month, as the pair starred in the stage production of Calendar Girls together.

The singer and actress lost her three-year battle with cancer almost a fortnight ago after first being diagnosed with the disease back in 2010.

Bernie beat breast cancer in 2010, but the disease returned in October 2012 and later spread to her liver, bones, lungs and brain.

The star had been being cared for in a hospice, but returned home to be with her family for her last days.
