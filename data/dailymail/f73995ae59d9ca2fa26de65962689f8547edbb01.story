Barcelona boss Luis Enrique is full of praise for his players after their 9-0 aggregate win against Elche in the Copa del Rey.

He told the club's official website: 'I have to compliment them all on their attitude. When you've got a tie virtually won, it's not easy to maintain the intensity levels that are necessary, but they did.' 

Having aleady beaten Elche 5-0 at the Camp Nou, the Catalan side went on to score four more goals in the second leg of the tie on January 15, and booked a quarter-final clash with Atletico Madrid later this month.

Enrique rested key names against Elche such as Neymar and Lionel Messi, and included six Barcelona B players in his squad. 

However, Neymar and Messi are expected to return to the starting line-up for Barcelona's next game in La Liga against Deportivo La Coruna. 

Barcelona are currently second in the league table with 41 points, a point behind Real Madrid, who have played a game less.

Enrique, who replaced Gerardo Martino as Barcelona chief in May last year, is under huge pressure to succeed at the Camp Nou. 

He recently faced allegations about a fallout with Messi after the striker was benched during Barcelona's 1-0 defeat to  Real Sociedad. 

But Enrique and Messi have since denied reports of a rift between them.
