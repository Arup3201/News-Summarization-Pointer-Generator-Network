Changing of the guard: Barcelona need to make eight summer signings

Every day Sportsmail 
takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories 
creating talking points on the continent.

While most Spanish papers are still reflecting on Atletico Madrid's title winning celebrations, Mundo Deportivo has moved on 
from the dramatic season finale to concentrate on what lies ahead for 
new Barcelona manager Luis Enrique, who will replace Gerardo Martino next season.

The 
Spanish daily suggests the incoming coach will need to make EIGHT 
new signings. Club president Josep Maria Bartomeu will be meeting with 
sporting director Andoni Zubizarrata to discuss how to return the 
Catalans to former glories.

The planned reinforcements include two 
goalkeepers, two central defenders and a striker - with names including 
Thibaut Courtois, Vincent Kompany, Toni Kroos, Thomas Muller, Paul 
Pogba and Fernando Llorente in the frame.

Other Spanish paperscontinue to rejoice Atletico Madrid's 1-1 draw with 
Barcelona that gave Diego Simeone's side a first La Liga win for 18 
years.

Thousands
 of Atletico fans took to the streets to celebrate with both AS and 
Marca splashing with pictures of midfielder Gabi climbing a statue of 
Neptune during the 'Fiesta!'.

Meanwhile, in Italy, the papers unsurprsingly lead with Juventus's record 102 point Serie A victory at the weekend.

The Old Lady claimed a third consecutive Scudetto following a comfortable 3-0 win against Calgari, which also included winning every single home game.

Andrea Pirlo opened the scoring in the eighth minute with Fernando Llorente and Claudio Marchisio also on target in a one-sided first half.

La Gazetta dello Sport features a pictures of the victorious team celebrating with the trophy, while also reflecting a 'crazy final day' that also saw Parma clinch a Europa League spot ahead of Torino after a impressive late run.

However, despite the celebrations, there are still doubts about manager Antonio Conte's future. Corriere delo Sport has used its front page headline to plead for the 44-year-old to stay, claiming all Juve supporters are behind him and pointing to his wife's emotional response to their title as reasons to remain in Turin.
