A truck whizzing down a Texas highway almost killed a deputy nearby.

Dash cam footage from the Dallas County Sheriff's Department shared with local media shows Deputy Christopher Loboda pulling over an Infiniti. The incident took place earlier this month on Interstate 635.

Ordinary day: Deputy Loboda is seen during the traffic stop

Within an inch of his life: Loboda turns to avoid the whizzing truck

Loboda gets out of his patrol vehicle to talk to the driver, the video shows.

Moments later, he has to make a quick turn when a truck drives nearby to avoid being hit.

He told CBSDFW 'My thought process was think small, be small - tuck everything that I had in. Don’t leave a foot out - Pull everything away from where this vehicle is coming from.'

Following the dramatic moment, Loboda is seen shaking his head at the driver's mishap.

Loboda rejected the driver's attempted apology, MyFoxDFW reported.

Loboda told the affiliate station 'The best thing for him, going through my mind, was just to get him back in his car and drive away.'

'I was pretty upset at the whole situation, and I knew the best thing to do was to get him back moving.'

Shaken: Loboda said he 'was pretty upset at the whole situation'
