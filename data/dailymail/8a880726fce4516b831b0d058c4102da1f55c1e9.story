When it comes to picking stocks, he's known as the Oracle of Omaha - able to make his investors billions, but it seems even Warren Buffett can make mistakes when it comes to cherry picking shares.

Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway investment group began trading in Tesco shares last autumn with $425 million of stock coupled with an option to buy $125 million more.

But the price fell almost instantly, and then kept on falling wiping away hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway investment company  is now nursing losses of about $750 million the shares plunged by as much as 47% this year. It paid $1.7 billion for the stake

Under pressure: Tesco has taken a hit to profits after strong competition from low-cost rivals Aldi and Lidl

Berkshire then sold off about $35 million worth of the stock of Britain's leading supermarket operator to cut its losses, but then repurchased even more shares just as the stock began to take another tumble.

His famed investment company was the third biggest shareholder, with a stake of almost 4%. 

Since last June, his shares in Tesco have lost almost $750 million in value after the shares plunged by as much as 43% this year. It paid $1.7 billion for the stake.

A lot of that stake was purchased after the supermarket chain issued a profit warning in January 2012.

When others were ditching the stock, Buffet was buying. 

Mr Buffett has made his fortune taking brave, long-term decisions with his famous quote: 'Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.'

Tesco issued a series of profit warnings this year as its sales shrank in the face of intense competition from lower cost rivals.Its top management, including the CEO and finance chief, have been replaced

Short sellers – those who bet shares will fall – have made spectacular returns on Tesco. 

Tesco has  suspended four executives and called in auditors from Deloitte to conduct an investigation as to how their profits seem to fall wildly below expectations. 

'Considering all the problems that Tesco is tackling at the moment ... poor internal accounting issues was the last thing it needed,' said Alastair McCaig, a market analyst at IG in London to CNN Money. 'A downgrade of 23% for its profit forecast is more than a minor issue.' 

Since the company reported the accounting bungle Monday, its shares have dropped by about 17% to an 11-year low, wiping roughly $5 billion off the firm's market value.

 Buffett is unlikely to be panicking yet. His guiding principle has always been to find solid companies that will do well over the long-term -- for years, not just a few quarters.

 The question for investors now is, do Tesco shares look cheap again? Most analysts say they are still to be avoided.
