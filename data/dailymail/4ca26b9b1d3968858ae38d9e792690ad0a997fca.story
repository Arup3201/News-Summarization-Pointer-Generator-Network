Lance Winder was crushed to death by a digger when it tipped over and fell on his head 

A builder was crushed to death by a digger in a freak accident when  the machine tipped over and fell on his head.

Lance Winder was renovating his bungalow when the digger he hired for the day tipped over and pinned him to the ground, an inquest heard.

His friend and fellow labourer found the 48-year-old unconscious in the back garden and immediately thought Mr Winder 'looked like he was dead'.

Mr Winder was crushed underneath the machine and had been knocked out by its metal safety bar.

Paramedics arrived at the building site in Marlow Bottom, Buckinghamshire, shortly after the accident on September 17 but the builder was declared dead at the scene.

Michael Papamichael told the inquest at Beaconsfield Coroner's Court that he had offered to help his friend out with the work as he was unemployed at the time.

Mr Papamichael was breaking slabs at the front of the property when tragedy struck.

When he went round to the back garden he saw the digger was tipped on its side with Mr Winder trapped beneath it.

'A metal bar was on the side of his head,' Mr Papamichael said.

'It immediately looked like he was dead.

'The digger was completely still. There was no sound and the tracks were still.'

He said his friend was not wearing a hard hat or a seatbelt.

'I can't remember seeing anything that could have tipped the digger over,' he added.

Health and Safety Executive officer John Berezansky said no defects were found in the mini-excavator machine that could have contributed to Mr Winder's death.

He said marks had been found on the back wall which were 'consistent with the machine coming backwards and rolling onto its side'.

The vehicle's centre of gravity was quite far back, meaning it could tip over in this way, Mr Berezansky said.

It was not clear whether Mr Winder had tried to jump clear of the digger or been thrown from it before being pinned down by the roll bar - a protective device.

Mr Berezansky said: 'There are two scenarios and it is impossible to say.

'It can be tempting. You think you can jump clear. But you're probably safer if you stay in the vehicle rather than trying to escape.'

The yellow digger which crushed Mr Winder was estimated to weigh more than a tonne.

Mr Winder was killed 'almost instantaneously' in the tragic accident, the inquest at Beaconsfield Coroner's Court (pictured) heard

A post-mortem examination showed Mr Winder had died from severe head injuries.

His death would have been 'virtually instantaneous,' pathologist Dr Peter Johnson told the hearing. 

Mr Winder was renovating his family home and was living with his partner, Christina Cajal, in a temporary caravan on the site.

His father David said his son had been hoping to marry Christina and was settling down after a lifetime of travelling, which had seen him go around the world twice.  

Senior coroner Richard Hulett said: 'I can see from these photographs, it is quite an achievement for it [the digger] to end up like this.

'By some means or other it's toppled over and crushed him.'

Mr Hulett said it was 'impossible to disentangle' if Mr Winder had undone his seatbelt to jump out or if he had simply not been wearing one and been thrown out of the digger.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, he said: 'It was something completely unintentional and it has cost him his life.'

Speaking after the inquest, Mr Winder's father said: 'His passports showed he'd been to 52 countries. He'd been there, done it and got the t-shirt.

'You never expect your son to go before you, so it's been difficult. It was just a tragic accident.'
