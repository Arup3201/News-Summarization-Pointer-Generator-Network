A man who allegedly asphyxiated his mother to death in Florida before speeding away in her car has been apprehended and is behind bars awaiting arraignment.

The Seminole County Sheriff's Office said in a Sunday release 20-year-old Joshua Ortiz murdered Jacqueline Suzanne Ortiz October 19 while inside the family's Oviedo residence.

Ortiz then drove away with her vehicle, authorities said.

'He was located a few days later by Maryland State Police and booked into the Howard County Central Booking Facility,' the release from the sheriff's office said.

It also revealed that authorities booked Ortiz November 1 with a second-degree murder charge, and he is now inside John E. Polk Correctional Facility with no bond.

Ortiz's brothers, Zachary Seymour and Samuel Ortiz, discovered Jacqueline Ortiz lying in the kitchen, WOFL reported.

In a 911 call obtained by the affiliate station, Samuel Ortiz said of his mother 'She's on the floor, she's all bruised up, she doesn't have a pulse, she's not breathing, I don't know how long she's been there.

Seymour also confirmed facial bruising during the call, saying, 'Yes, on her face, along her mouth, her chin, and on her cheekbone. She's cold, she's not responding, her fingers are rigor mortis.'

Before the alleged murder, Ortiz argued with both his mother and siblings because he did not want to eat, documents claim, according to the affiliate station.

Ortiz's brothers left the property following a front lawn fight, returned following their haircuts, then discovered the scene, the documents reportedly say.

Ortiz's public defender Jeff Dowdy told reporters on Monday, the same day as his client's court appearance, 'This is a very, very difficult case. It's a very sad story. I met Mr. Ortiz for the first time this this morning. He's very scared,' according to WESH.

Held: Ortiz is now inside John E. Polk Correctional Facility with no bond

Psychiatrist Dr. Jeffrey Danzinger has been recruited by Ortiz and Dowdy, the affiliate station reported.

Ortiz acted as jury foreman less than a week leading up to the alleged murder, WESH earlier reported.

Assistant State Attorney Stacey Simmons told the news outlet, 'They felt as though he was competent and capable enough to not only participate in that decision, but to lead that potential group to a decision .'

'We anticipate that mental health may be a defense and to that end it's very telling that six days before his mother's murder he was able to participate,' she also said. 

An arraignment is set for January 6, according to WOFL.
