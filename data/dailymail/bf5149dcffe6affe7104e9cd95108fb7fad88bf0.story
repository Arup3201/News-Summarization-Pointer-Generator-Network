Real Madrid are closing in on a deal to bring World Cup golden boot winner James Rodriguez to the Bernabeu, according to Spanish paper AS.

The Madrid-based newspaper claims the Champions League winners have reached a verbal agreement with the player and now the club needs only to close the deal with Monaco, who are asking £63million (€80million) for the highly-rated Colombia forward.

Negotiations have not been straight forward, but Madrid hope to sell winger Angel Di Maria to Paris Saint-Germain this week for £47m (€60m) and that could speed up the deal.
