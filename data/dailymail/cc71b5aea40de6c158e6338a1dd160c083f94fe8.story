A 73-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday for viewing child pornography on two laptops while parked in a handicapped parking space outside a Lowe's store in York, South Carolina.

Leroy Moore, Jr., 73, had parked close enough to the entrance that he was able to use the store's free Wi-Fi.

A passerby happened to see what appeared to be obscene pictures on a laptop in Moore's car and called police.

Leroy Moore, Jr., 73, was arrested on Wednesday for viewing child pornography. He is in jail on a $10,000 bond and could serve 10 years if he's convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor

‘It was chilling and disturbing,’ said York police Lt. Rich Caddell. He said Moore didn't try to hide anything. 

‘He told us what he was doing. When we asked him he said he was watching little boys,’ said Caddell. 

The officer was wearing a body camera, which captured both Moore's confession and the pornographic pictures visible on his laptop.

Caddell had to view the pornographic images in order to make the case against Moore.

‘What I watched still affects me today, and will probably affect me for a while,’ said Caddell.

Moore is in jail on a $10,000 bond and could serve 10 years if he's convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor.

Following Moore's arrest, police have begun trying to link him to several complaints they'd received going back to the summer. 

In those complaints, callers told officers they'd seen a man in a white Pontiac like Moore's, sitting in public parks, and in store parking lots looking suspicious. 

They now believe that man may have been Moore.

According to WSOC9, Moore's neighbor Jerry McCurry - who fixes computers as his hobby - found a folder containing graphic, underage pornography titled 'My Girls' while working on Moore's computer four years ago.

McCurry reported the crime, but Moore was never charged.

Officer Edwards was one of the cops involved in Moore's arrest. His body camera captured both Moore's confession and the pornographic pictures visible on his laptop
