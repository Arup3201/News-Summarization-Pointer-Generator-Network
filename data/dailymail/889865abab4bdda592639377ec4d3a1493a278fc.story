NHS staff in Glasgow were forced to fill out a form to move an office printer to examine the possible effect it would have on different 'population groups' including gipsies and asylum seekers (file picture)

NHS staff were forced to fill out a seven-page form just to move an office printer – to ensure that gays, gipsies and other minorities were not offended.

In an illustration of the politically correct bureaucracy strangling the health service, staff had to consider the possible human rights implications of shifting the equipment.

The ‘ludicrous’ form examined potential consequences for homeless people, gipsy travellers and asylum seekers – and even asked whether the move could encourage people to commit suicide.

It comes at a time of growing crisis in the NHS, with some patients being denied life- saving drugs while others have to wait up to 24 hours in hospital A&E departments.

Scottish Tory MSP Alex Johnstone said: ‘Ludicrous doesn’t even begin to sum up this incident. This level of waste and madness would never be tolerated in the private sector. 

'At a time when the NHS is supposed to be responsible with budgets, this is hardly a shining example of efficiency.’

The existence of the human rights forms came to light during a review of a proposal to site two printers instead of three on two floors at the Glasgow offices of quango NHS Health Scotland.

It listed 17 different ‘population groups’ such as transgender people, lesbians and the disabled, and asked how they could be ‘affected differentially by the policy [of moving the printer]’.

Even the potential effect on ‘people involved in the criminal justice system’ featured in the bizarre audit.

Among ten human rights issues explored were the right to a family life and to freedom of expression. An examination of the right to life under the European Convention on Human rights even asked if moving the printer could lead to suicide.

Unsurprisingly, the Health Inequalities Impact Assessment concluded that in these cases there were no negative consequences.

However, the review, undertaken by two members of staff, noted that there would be a ‘general impact on all staff of making more queuing likely for the printer’ but there could be a positive social impact as ‘the people who do printing are more likely to meet and chat at the printers which do exist’.

In addition, staff members with mobility issues could ask ‘teammates’ for assistance if necessary.

NHS Health Scotland describes itself as a ‘national Health Board working with public, private and third sectors to reduce health inequalities and improve health’.

In 2007, it emerged that it was setting up a £1million-a-year Directorate of Equalities and Planning to ensure lesbians, gays and immigrants were not discriminated against by the NHS.

Staff were forced to fill out the forms because they had to consider the possible human rights implications of shifting the printers. NHS Health Scotland said it was ‘committed to being a great place to work’ (file picture)

Health campaigner Dr Jean Turner said: ‘It sounds a little bit like bureaucracy taking over reason. Anyone who has worked in an office knows all you want is a printer that actually works and does all that you require of it.’

A spokesman for campaign group TaxpayerScotland said: ‘This is a ludicrous example of out-of-control bureaucracy. This assessment was written by a taxpayer-funded civil servant who surely must have something more useful to do.’

NHS Health Scotland said it was ‘committed to being a great place to work’ which aims ‘to ensure all staff are treated fairly and consistently and with dignity and respect.’

A spokesman said: ‘To help us do this and to comply with the Equality Act 2010, we take time to impact assess new policies and practices. It helps us check we don’t unintentionally disadvantage any of our staff.

‘In this specific case, a concern was raised that reducing the number of printers... might make things harder for staff with disabilities affecting their mobility. We therefore conducted the impact assessment to make sure it did not.’
