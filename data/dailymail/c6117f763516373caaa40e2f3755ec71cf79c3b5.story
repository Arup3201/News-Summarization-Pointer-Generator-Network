Upgrades to the House of Commons gym which features a new sauna and spinning studio named after the Speaker have cost taxpayers £1million – more than four times the proposed cost.

The Westminster Gym, exclusively used by parliamentary passholders, now boasts a towel room, a new area for exercise bikes and a renovated reception.

Taxpayers will foot the bill for improvements at the fitness centre, which counts Jack Straw, Iain Duncan Smith and David Davis among its users.

Commons' Speaker, John Bercow, will officially re-open the gym next week and inspect the new spinning studio which has been named after him.

The upgrades, which also include improving disabled access and treating damp, were originally meant to cost £250,000.

But that figure is expected to rise to £1,081,379, according to figures obtained by the Sunday Times through a freedom of information request.

Andy Silvester, campaign director of the Taxpayers' Alliance pressure group, said: 'Every day we hear hot air from politicians about balancing the books, so to see that a sauna and a spinning studio have survived the austerity programme is absolutely remarkable, especially when the rest of the estate is in such bad shape,' Silvester said.

'With the amount of gyms in Westminster, it's baffling that taxpayers are still paying for a gym that they're barred from using.'

At least 700 MPs, peers and other parliamentary pass holders belong to the health club which gets its income and profit from membership fees

He pointed out that voters have already paid £2billion for essential repairs to the Palace of Westminster.

At least 700 MPs, peers and other parliamentary pass holders belong to the health club which gets its income and profit from membership fees – the most expensive of which costs £47 a month.

The House of Commons has a share of the profits and in the year from 2012 to 2013 it received £21,337.

The refurbishment comes just three years after the ventilation system in the basement area of the Commons was refurbished at a cost of £247,500.

There was no mention of replacing the sauna in the men's changing room with a new model when reports of the plans first surfaced.

A spokesman for the House of Commons said: 'In taking advantage of the opportunity we anticipate cost savings in the longer term, as the area will not be disturbed when the systems in the remaining parts of the building are renewed.

MPs spent £518,635 on hotels, airline upgrades and bar bills last year including a £3,174 stay at the five-star Windsor Atlantica in Rio de Janeiro (pictured)

'It is the only facility of its kind on the estate, extensively used by a variety of groups, including members and staff, and it was not possible to replicate the facility elsewhere.

'This meant that work had to be phased and carried out during evenings and weekends.'

It has also been revealed that MPs and their staff ran up bills of £227,000 at hotels around the world that were paid for with the procurement cards.

Five-star hotels, airline upgrades, bar bills and treatment for bad backs helped to push up the annual total by £80,000 to £518,635 last year.

The Commons international development select committee spent £3,174 staying at the five-star Windsor Atlantica in Rio de Janeiro.

More than £2,143 was also spent by the same group at the Gefinor Rotana in Beirut and the justice select committee had a bill of £1,653.40 bill at the Old Government House in Guernsey.

A Commons spokesman said: 'The procurement cards were used for business purposes, allowing a limited number of employees to pay for relatively low-value items in a secure and efficient way.'

'The cards have strict controls for the authorisation of all transactions.'
