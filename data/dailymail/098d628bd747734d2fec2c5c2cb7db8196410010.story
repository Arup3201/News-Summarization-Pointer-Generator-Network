The family of an 8-year-old boy killed in the Boston Marathon bombing has created a charitable foundation in his memory and is recruiting a team of charity runners for this year's marathon.

In a blog posting on their website Monday, the family said the Martin W. Richard Charitable Foundation's mission is to invest in education, athletics and community.

The family said ‘Team MR8’ will recruit runners for the Boston Marathon 2014 who are committed to the foundation's mission.

In his honour: The Richard family have created a charitable foundation in the memory of their son, Martin, right, who died in the Boston Bombings. Their daughter Jane, left, lost her leg in the attack

The young boy was one of three people killed at the April 15, 2013, marathon when two bombs exploded near the finish line. More than 260 people were injured.

Authorities say two brothers from Russia who had lived in Cambridge for about a decade planted the bombs. 

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. His older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died following a shootout with police.

Martin's parents, Bill and Denise Richard, and his younger sister, Jane, 7, were all hurt in the attack.

Brave girl: Jane, 7, is starting to learn how to use her prostethic leg and is already playing basketball, said her parents

Too young: Martin, 8, was the youngest person killed in the April 15 attack last year

The family said Jane, who lost part of her left leg, is walking with a new prosthesis and playing basketball for her Catholic Youth Organization team.

They said medical appointments still consume many hours of every week.

‘We are often asked how we are doing. The short answer is we are continuing to heal and doing our best to live our lives,’ they wrote.

Victim: Martin Richard was killed in the Boston Marathon attack

‘We miss Martin deeply - more than words on paper could possibly describe. We persevere, trying to live as normal a life as possible for our sake and for the sake of our children.’

‘… while we will never forget the past we hope to look forward beginning in 2014.  We still have many people to meet and thank, some who risked their own lives for our family and others on Boylston Street that day: citizen bystanders, doctors, first responders and others. 

‘Please know we are eternally grateful and hope to meet everyone in time.’
