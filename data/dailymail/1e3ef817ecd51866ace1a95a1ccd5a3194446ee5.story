A film producer on a flight bound for Los Angeles has given a blow-by-blow account of how an unruly passenger forced the plane to make an unscheduled landing in Denver.

Cassian Elwes took to Twitter to reveal the ordeal suffered by passengers on Flight 677 when a man, identified only as an ex-Marine called Marco from Queens, New York, began behaving in an aggressive and erratic manner.

Drinking heavily and swallowing pills, the veteran abused passengers with threatening language, stumbled around the plane and sexually assaulted a pregnant woman, it is claimed.

The trouble began when the British filmmaker boarded the JetBlue Airways flight in New York on Sunday evening and found a man wearing a hooded top sitting in his window seat.

Arrest: An unruly passenger who forced a New York to Los Angeles flight to make an emergency landing is led away by Denver police in the early hours of yesterday morning

Intoxicated: The ex-Marine was drinking heavily and swallowing pills taken by people with bipolar disorder, according to tweets made by film producer Cassian Elwes, who was sat next to him

In the first of 60 tweets, Mr Elwes said:
'When I got on the plane I went to my seat 20f a window seat I had 
specifically booked. There was someone sitting already in my seat.

'A youngish looking guy maybe late 20s (turned out he was 32) quite burly white crew cut lots of tattoos. Gang looking maybe.

'Hey that's my seat man I said. A 
quick drawling f*** you its mine now was the response I sat down next to
him mumbling "charming".'

Fodder for his next script: Mr Elwes, a British movie producer, posted 60 tweets on the prolonged incident after landing in Los Angeles

Mr Elwes, who has worked on films 
including Margin Call, Blue Valentine and Lawless, said that Marco's 
bizarre behaviour rapidly escalated over the next three hours.

At one point he tore up a magazine, licked the pieces and stuck them to a television monitor in front of his seat.

He also stumbled up and down the plane and is said to have groped a pregnant woman.

Describing one walk around, Mr Elwes said: 'This time he walks to the front. I feel uneasy and I go 
back & tell one of the ladies that he's acting weird.

'And I'm really not sure that it's a good idea that he's hanging around the front where all the buttons are for the doors.'

Marco's verbal abuse and intoxicated 
demeanour eventually became so threatening that an off-duty air marshal 
was forced to sit next to him and the flight was diverted to Denver 
International Airport.

The
air marshal and Marco exchanged words, until, as Elwes tweeted: 'Hoodie
tries to get up but air marshal blocks him. More f*** yous.

'Hoodie throws his vodka at him but it lands on the couple in front of him.'

It
was then that Mr Elwes, who had moved his seat earlier in the flight to
get away from Marco, volunteered to again sit next to the ex-Marine, 
telling him, 'Let's talk let's just talk.'

He tweeted: 'I
sit. The smell of alcohol is incredible. Do (you) like movies. F*** 
you. Do you go to films. F*** you. Do you write at all... Yes he 
says... Where did you grow up. I'm a f****** marine man don't f*** with 
me he says. I will kill you man. Come on I say what have you written?'

Ordeal: Mr Elwes tweeted about the veteran's disruptive behaviour in detail

Note: Mr Elwes reveals the contents of a note Marco wrote to him

Marco
replied that he wrote a short-story the day before about a 'kamikaze 
pilot' who 'sees his kids and wife in (a) flashback just as he crashes 
his plane,' according to Mr Elwes.

'ThIs is not a particularly reassuring
conversation 20 rows from the cockpit. Where did u grow up. Lower east 
side man NY. Shooting heroin... I live in Queens now. I went to the 
marines to get off drugs.

'He
pulls out a canister from his pocket filled with little green pills. He
swigs from it. The plane jolts and the pills fly everywhere. Did u ever
write about the marines. F*** you man I don't want to talk about it. 
I've seen s*** no man should ever see. I can't write it.'

At
this point, Elwes tells Marco that he is a movie producer, to which the
ex-Marine says he is going to LA to work on a commercial.

'Listen man I
want u to read my stuff, it's a movie,' Marco reportedly told Mr Elwes.

'Cool I say. Give me your email which he does.'

Urgent detour: The red-eye flight from New York City to LAX was diverted at about 1am yesterday

As
the plane lands, Marco repeatedly implored Mr Elwes: 'Don't forget me. 
Don't forget me, man. Don't forget me' and hands the producer a folded 
piece of paper, which Mr Elwes initially believes is his email address.

Moments later, police board the plane and escort Marco off in handcuffs.

Mr Elwes tweets: 'We eventually take off again. I replay the whole thing in my mind again as the adrenaline 
wears off. What's the message what's the point...I realize the point is 
these wars are f***** with our children's minds. A whole generation is 
being sent home screwed up.

'I
find one of the pills on the floor and the nice lady in front Googles 
it on her phone. Its clonazepam a drug for bi-polar anxiety.'

Mr Elwes then opened the 
folded pieces of paper that Marco had given him before being taken off 
the plane.

He tweeted: 'This is what he wrote: 
"We all love the ones we hate. Blood. Lust. I was born in Queens. We all
lose hope". Marco I won't forget you I promise.'

'He pulls out this patch that says "stay" on it': Mr Elwes posted this photo on Twitter
