Teddy Sheringham scored a stunning chip as an All Star line-up defeated a Rangers XI in a Fernando Ricksen tribute match played on Sunday.

The West Ham coach missed the Hammers' 1-0 FA Cup victory over Bristol City to attend the clash at Ibrox and rolled back the years with a classy finish after just three minutes as Fernando's All Stars claimed a 7-4 victory over a Rangers Select side which included a number of star names including Gennaro Gattuso, Ronald de Boer, Jorg Albertz and Arthur Numan.

Former Manchester United striker Sheringham - playing alongside Ricksen's Dutch compatriots Kiki Musampa, Denny Landzaat and Paul Bosvelt - hit the ball first time and produced a delightful chip which sailed high above former Rangers goalkeeper Stefan Klos before bouncing into the net.
