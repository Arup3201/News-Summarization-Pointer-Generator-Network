Alan Brazil has suggested Brendan Rodgers is losing patience with Daniel Sturridge's injury problems, with the Liverpool striker set for another spell on the sidelines.

Sturridge suffered a recurrence earlier this week of the thigh problem he first suffered in September while on England duty.

He is set to be out of action for six weeks, meaning he could miss 12 games.

Thigh - during England training, September 2014. Missed six weeks.

Calf - during Liverpool training, October 2014. Missed three weeks.

Thigh - during Liverpool training, November 2014. Out for six weeks.

Rodgers has not been able to select Sturridge - who has also had a calf injury in between his thigh issues - since August 31 and Brazil, on his daily breakfast show on talkSPORT, hinted that the Liverpool manager is becoming irritated by being without his first-choice striker.

In conversation with co-host Mike Parry, Brazil said: 'I have heard that the staff, I won't say who but, are getting just a little bit fed up of what is going on there with Sturridge.'

Parry replied: 'Erm, the staff, Al? You are going to have to tell us a little bit more about that. That's just a taster.'

Brazil, who is friends with Rodgers, then said: 'Well, let's put it this way. I think Brendan is very, very upset… I mean, what is going on here? Why is he (Sturridge) always injured?'

Sportsmail have approached Liverpool for comment.

Sturridge has suffered another injury setback to his thigh in training for Liverpool

Sturridge was outstanding last season and his partnership with Luis Suarez was worth more than 50 goals for Liverpool, as they came within two points of winning their first title since 1990.

But it has been a completely different situation this time around. Though he scored the winning goal against Southampton on the opening weekend of the new season, he has not kicked a ball for his club since their 3-1 win against Tottenham at the end of August.

He was sidelined for six weeks after breaking down during an England training session and then, at the start of October, he damaged his calf just before he was scheduled to return.

Rodgers had hoped that Sturridge would be ready to make his comeback at Selhurst Park this Sunday but there is no chance of that and Liverpool are sweating on how long he will be absent.

This last setback puts an even greater emphasis on Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini - who have yet to score in the Premier League for Liverpool this season - to produce goals in Sturridge's absence.
