Refusal: Syria has rejected an Arab League call for President Bashar al-Assad to hand over power to his deputy

Syria has rejected an Arab League call for President Bashar al-Assad to hand over power to his deputy.

Meeting in Cairo, the league also called on Syria to set up a new unity government within two months. 

'Syria rejects the decisions of the Arab
League ministerial council ... and considers them a violation of its 
national sovereignty and a flagrant interference in its internal 
affairs,' a government official said on state TV said. 

The league called on both sides to end the recent fighting, with the UN estimating more than 5,000 people have died as a result of the crackdown on protests since last March.

The government in Damascus says it is fighting 'terrorists and armed 
gangs' and claims that some 2,000 members of the security forces have 
been killed.

The statement 
did not mention the ministers' decision to extend the mission of Arab 
League observers, who have faced criticism over their failure to stem 
the bloodshed in Syria since they first deployed last month.

Arab foreign ministers called on 
Assad on Sunday to hand over to a deputy and set up a new unity 
government, as a prelude to early parliamentary and presidential 
elections.

The details were announced by Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani at a press conference in Cairo.

Reports have emerged that Russia is signing a contract to sell combat jets to Syria in a show of support for President Bashar Assad's regime.

Newspaper Kommersant said that the $550-million deal envisages the delivery of 36 Yak-130 aircraft.

Russia's Rosoboronexport state arms trader refused to comment on the report.

The European Union has thrown its weight the Arab League transitional government plan.

Monday's meeting of EU foreign ministers also extended measures against Assad's government by adding 22 more officials and eight more companies to a sanctions regime.

EU nations also called for United Nations action to end the repression which the U.N. says has left more than 5,400 people dead.

EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said she had spoken to Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby and backed the call for the establishment of a national unity government in Syria within two months.

Assad has faced more than 10 months of protests against his rule and a growing armed rebellion.

'Syria
condemns this decision which is part of the conspiracy against Syria,' 
the official source said, saying that instead of cutting off the flow of
money and weapons to 'terrorist groups' in Syria, the ministers were 
issuing 'inflammatory statements.' 

The
source criticised the Arab League for ignoring reforms which Assad has 
promised, including a referendum on a new constitution, and which were 
lacking 'in many of the Arab states leading the hostile campaign against
Syria.'      

Meanwhile,
violence has continued in Syria, with fighting reported between 
government troops and army defectors in Damascus' suburb of Douma on 
Sunday.

At least five people were killed, according to Syria's Local Coordination Committees.

Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby said the Syrian government had not seen through with some parts of an Arab League agreement designed to end a violent crackdown on protesters.

Syrian officials are treating the crisis as a security problem, he said, stating that armed opposition factions controlling some areas made it difficult for observers to do their jobs.

But Arab League monitors have seen some aspects of the situation improve, he said.

'The presence of the Arab monitors provided security to opposition parties, which held an increase in number of peaceful protests ... in the areas where the monitors were present,' el-Araby said.
