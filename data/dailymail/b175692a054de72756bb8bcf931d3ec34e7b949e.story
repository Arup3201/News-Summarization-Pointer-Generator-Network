Wonky carrots, stunted parsnips and imperfect apples will all make a return to supermarket shelves after Britain's dismal weather conditions affected this year's harvest.

Shoppers are used to browsing the aisles for strawberries, cucumbers and carrots that look just as good as they taste.

But the wettest June on record, a cool July, and hail storms in August have all taken a toll on Britain's fruit and vegetables - prompting retailers to relax their rules on the cosmetic standards for produce.

Not so pretty parsnips: Misshapen vegetables like these gnarled parsnips could soon be appearing on supermarket shelves as a result of the poor harvest

The move comes after farmers urged retailers not to waste perfectly tasty fresh produce because of a few blemishes or an unusual shape.

EU rules on misshapen fruit and veg were relaxed in 2009 but supermarkets still maintain private product standards.

The National Farmers Union has said its members were already struggling to cope with below average yields this year.

In June apple growers told how their orchards had been blighted by frost, rain and hailstorms, meaning the year's crop would be dramatically reduced.

Fruit farmers in the West Midlands, East Anglia, the South West and parts of the South East said they had lost as much as 65 per cent of their harvest.

In July - traditionally peak season for potatoes - farmers reported that they had lost 40 per cent of their potato crop because of waterlogged fields.

If supermarkets were to reject what produce has survived, it could push some farmers out of business, according to the NFU.

Wonky: Fruit and vegetables that are the 'wrong' shape are just as tasty as the more aesthetically pleasing versions

'The NFU has been calling on supermarkets to relax their standards because we do not want perfectly good fruit and vegetables rejected,' said Lee Abbey, a horticulture adviser at the union.

'Common sense should be applied,' he told theÂ Daily Telegraph.

Small marks on the skin of fruits do not affect their flavour, but supermarkets will often reject blemished produce.

Retailers also insist on vegetables meeting certain size standards, despite the fact that a small carrot will taste just as good as a larger one.

This year major supermarkets Asda, Tesco, Waitrose and Sainsbury's have all pledged to sell more fruit and veg that previously would have been dumped for failing to meet cosmetic standards.

But author Tristram Stuart, who campaigns against food wastage, said a one-off relaxation of rules in response to the poor harvest was not enough.

He has said farmers are routinely forced to throw away up to 40 per cent of a crop because it is not aesthetically pleasing enough.

According to Mr Stuart, founder of the Feeding the 5,000 campaign, when the harvest returns to normal farmers will again be forced to dump produce.

Misshapen: In 2009 the EU relaxed rules governing the cosmetic appearance of fruit and veg

In 2009 the EU announced it was to repeal specific marketing standards for 26 different types of fruit and vegetables, including asparagus, aubergines, sprouts, cabbage, melons and courgettes.

The change effectively meant that member states could permit the sale of all fruit and vegetables - regardless of their size and shape.

Specific marketing standards remained in place for apples, citrus fruit, kiwis, lettuce, peaches, nectarines, pears, strawberries, sweet peppers, grapes and tomatoes.

But the change meant EU countries could still allow retailers to stock fruit and veg that failed to meet the standards if they labelled items appropriately.
