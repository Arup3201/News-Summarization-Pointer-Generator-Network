Rosa Rios has been accused of stealing lunch and money from children on the school bus 

A school bus worker has been charged with stealing lunch boxes and money from dozens of children between the ages of five and three.

Rosa Rios, 33, was allegedly seen rifling through the backpacks of children and taking lunch and cash as they were travelling to school in Millville in New Jersey on the bus she works on.

Rios, who worked as an aide for Sheppard Bus Services and was supposed to be supervising children on board, has now been sacked from the company. 

Millville Public Schools, which manages 10 schools in the area which use the bus service to transport children, has written to parents of pupils informing them about the arrest of Rios.

Authorities said the alleged thefts took place between January and February. 

Rios is believed to have targeted 29 children, the Courier Post reported. 

The incident came to light when an investigation was launched when another driver claimed they were missing around $400.

Police reviewed surveillance footage from the bus and found Rios allegedly taking items from the children's backpacks while they were on board and on their way to school. 

'It looks like she was trying to take advantage of them,' said police Detective Lt. Jody Farabella. 

'Sheppard did the best thing by firing her. 

'It's also good for the district to let parents know things are OK.'

David Gentile of Millville Public Schools said once the incident came to light Rios was removed immediately from the Sheppard bus routes.  

Police did not confirm how many times the thefts allegedly took place or how many children were targeted. 

Millville worked as a bus aide for Sheppard Bus Services where she was meant to be helping children on board

Officers are also investigating whether Rios was responsible for the theft from the bus driver.  

Rios has been charged with theft and robbery and is being held in Cumberland County Jail.
