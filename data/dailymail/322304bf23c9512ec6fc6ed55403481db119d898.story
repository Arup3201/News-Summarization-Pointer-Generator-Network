The cults of Apple, Google and Facebook continue to be formidable forces in today’s society.

These technology giants have employee populations larger than some small towns, and fans that are willing to pay any price to have their latest release.

Now one Berkeley-based designer has unveiled his vision of what towns designed by these Silicon Valley groups might look like.

For Facebook, Mr Twu, has designed campus housing 9,400 staff in Menlo Park, California. It includes a number of high-rise blocks, a sky bridge over a motorway and its own train station

Alfred Twu’s vision focuses on Google, Apple, Facebook, and Electronic Arts, but he's also created with a generic space to serve as a model for smaller start-ups.

‘The booming tech industry has created huge demand for housing in the San Francisco Bay Area, driving up housing costs and leading to long commutes,’ said Mr Twu.

‘Meanwhile, tech workers flock to San Francisco and Oakland, seeking the high-density urban environment that Silicon Valley lacks.

This is Alfred Twu's vision of a iTown which is dedicated to Apple workers. The main office building is circular and features an iMaill, iSlabs and iTowers. It also has its very own underground road network

The Google headquarters housing is shown in this aerial view from the east. Mr Twu created the design after wondering what would happen if 10,000 Google employees working at the main Mountain view campus were provided with on-site housing

‘What might it look like if tech campuses replaced their parking lots and provided all the necessary housing on-site?’

Mr Twu’s notes that technology workers' impact on housing prices is a divisive topic in the Bay Area.  

The issue stems from a shortage of housing in Silicon Valley, which was originally research labs and electronics factories.  

Now, software is dominant, and a lot more programmers can fit in the same space.  ‘In fact,’ he says, ‘many don't need a desk at all.’

Electronics Arts headquarters features a total building area of three million square feet housing five huge blocks for employees

Google, for instance employs 10,000 at its Mountain View headquarters.  Surprisingly, that number of apartments can fit on the parking lots and open spaces of the suburban campus.  

‘Most would be in towers of 30 to 50 floors, with the rest in lower blocks lining the site,’ said Mr Twu.

Such a concentration of people would also create the critical mass to attract the trendy services and amenities that currently only San Francisco offers, he added.

‘This study assumes regular apartments, with an average of 800 sq ft per family of 2,’ he said.  

‘It also assumes very limited parking.  Co-op style housing typically can get down to 200 square feet per resident, roughly double the efficiency of apartments.  That would still be a lot of housing in one spot though.’

This is part of an on-going trend.  Sao Paulo's Vila Olimpia neighbourhood, for example, is planning a huge building full of micro-apartments rise in 2016, to serve employees of Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Unilever.

This is what the iPlaza could look like from the northwest campus entrance in Apple's iTown. Such a concentration of people would create the critical mass to attract the trendy services and amenities that currently only San Francisco offers, said Mr Twu.

According to a report in Co.Exist , Bruce Katz, head of the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program, has suggested that instead of housing tech campuses in suburban areas, the will see the tech economy give rise to innovation districts.

Mr Twu doesn’t necessarily believe that San Francisco should be the location for these mega-tech cities.

‘I was thinking about what exactly are the things in San Francisco that attract people who have jobs 50 miles away and go back and forth every day,’ Mr Twu told Sydney Brownstone at Co.Exist.

‘And part of it's just being around other people, being around different stores and restaurants.’

But many believe having a town dedicated to technology workers could create its own problems. Not least, the choice of entertainment options on a Friday night.
