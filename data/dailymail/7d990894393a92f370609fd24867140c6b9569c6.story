No one has come forward to claim the body of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, it has been revealed, as investigators continue to piece together his movements prior to the attack.

Tsarnaev was shot during a dramatic gunbattle with cops in Watertown, Massachusetts on Friday, before police said he was run over by his younger brother Dzhokhar as he tried to escape.

Tamerlan was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.

Dead:
Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed during a shootout with police on Friday

Harrowing: Images taken by a resident show the suspected Boston Marathon bombers hiding behind a car as they engage in a dramatic shootout with police in Watertown last month

Battle: The eyewitness said the men ran to the green sedan, left, for more supplies such as explosives

Married: Katherine Russell was 21 when she married Tamerlan and converted to Islam. They have a child together who is now three years old

ABC News reported that so far, neither his wife - Katherine Russell - nor other family members have claimed his body for burial.

Katherine, was 21 when she converted to Islam and married Tsarnaev. After marrying, she left Suffolk University without graduating.

They had a daughter, Zahara, now 3. Tamerlan seems never to have found a full-time career. His family members say his new wife supported him, while he stayed home with the child.

The report came as incredible new 
photos of the shootout showed the brothers taking shelter behind a 
vehicle and taking aim at police.

The images, taken by a resident, show
 the brothers running to a car for more supplies before hauling out a 
pressure cooker bomb they then detonated, filling the street with smoke.

The
 photos were taken on the eyewitness' phone from a third-floor bedroom 
overlooking the harrowing scene, are the first images giving insight 
into the fraught battle that left one brother dead.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is recovering from a gunshot wound to the neck in the hospital, has told investigators that his older brother was the ringleader in the attacks.

Threat: In another image, a red circle shows what the eyewitness believed to be a pressure cooker bomb

Escape: After detonating the bomb and filling the street with smoke, the youngest brother jumped in the car and ploughed towards the police officers lining the end of the residential street

Taken down: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gunfight with police on April 19. Dzhokhar, who was injured, was captured that eveningÂ 

Andrew Kitzenberg, who snapped the photographs as he sought refuge in his home, shared the dramatic images and details on his blog.

'I
 was in my living room working on my computer when I heard multiple 
"pops" coming from outside,' he recalled. 'At that point, I had no idea 
that I was about to become an eye witness to the biggest news story in 
the country.

'When
 I looked outside my window, I could clearly see two people (the 
Tsarnaev brothers) taking cover behind an SUV and engaging in gunfire.'

He ran to the third floor of the home to seek shelter from the gunfire.

'As
 I ran into my room, overwhelmed by shock, adrenaline, and curiosity, I 
jumped onto my bed to stay below the windows but also have a clear view 
at the shooters and photograph the event,' he said.

He described seeing the men jump out of a green sedan, which they returned to for supplies - 'assumingly, more ammunition and explosives'.

Aftermath: When the gun battle was over, police rushed to where the green sedan was parked and announced there were other devices on the street, sparking a search

In another picture, he highlights a dark object that he identifies as a pressure cooker bomb.

'The
 use of this explosive created an enormous cloud of smoke that covered 
the entire street,' he wrote. 'While the street was still cloudy with 
smoke one of the brothers started running down the street towards the 
officers, while still engaging them in gunshots.

'As he got closer to the officers, within 10-15 yards of them he was taken down.'

Kitzenberg added he had been unable to see whether police knocked him to the ground or shot him.

His brother then jumped in their car and barreled towards the police cars barricading the end of the street. Authorities said he ran over his brother.

The images reveal the moment Dzhokhar headed for the police cars - dodging between two.

'The SUV side swiped both cars taking out doors and windows and ultimately broke through the vehicle barricade and continued driving west on Laurel St.,' Kitzenberg wrote on his blog. 'This was the last I saw of the black SUV.'

Trawl: On Monday, a police forensics team examined the boat where Dzhokhar was found hiding

Scene: He was found cowering in the boat after its owner realized its straps had moved on Friday evening

Hideout: Dzhokhar was found hiding in this boat in Watertown on Friday following a massive manhunt

Apprehended: Dzhokhar is searched and given medical attention after he is found hiding on Friday evening

It wouldn't be until hours later when authorities would catch up to Dzhokhar, who was wounded in the shootout.

Watertown police chief Edward Deveau 
said David Henneberry, of Watertown, was checking his boat after the lockdown was lifted 
on Friday evening and noticed the straps were not the way he had left them.

He looked in the boat, saw blood and 
someone huddled in a corner and quickly called police. The discovery set
 up the final confrontation and capture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,
 who was pictured being taken away on a stretcher, remains in the hospital 
as he recovers from a bullet wound to the neck.

He told investigators in scrawled 
notes on Monday that his brother orchestrated the attacks because he 
'wanted to defend Islam from attack', but that he and his brother were 
not linked to any Islamic terrorist groups.

According to CNN, Dzhokhar said his 
older brother, Tamerlan, was the ringleader in the attacks that shook 
the nation a week ago, but that the pair were working alone.

On Monday, he was arraigned in his hospital bed.

He is charged with one count of using
 and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction - namely, an 
improvised explosive device or IED - against persons and property within
 the U.S. resulting in death, and one count of malicious 
destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in 
death.

Three people - Martin Richard, 8, 
Krystle Campbell, 29, and Lu Lingzi, 23 - were killed in the Boston Marathon bombings and 
more than 200 others were injured.
