The Alaskan TV reporter who quit live on air so she could fight to legalize marijuana allegedly smoked so much weed at home that she made her neighbor's four-year-old daughter ill.

Charlo Greene, who stormed out of the KTVA studio after saying, 'f*** it, I quit', was served with a temporary restraining order two weeks ago following complaints from her neighbor, TMZ reported.

Tyler Gilbrech, who lives below the Anchorage apartment shared by Greene and her boyfriend, said the couple immediately began making the building smell after they moved in in June.

It became so bad that his young daughter became violently sick from the fumes, TMZ reported.

Devoted: Charlo Greene, a former Alaska news reporter who quit to fight to legalize weed, has been served with a restraining order for smoking so much marijuana at home that it made a neighbor's daughter ill

Support: She lived at the Anchorage apartment with her boyfriend Peter, pictured, until two weeks ago

He complained to the building manager and she allegedly told him to 'watch his back', focing him to fight for a temporary restraining order against her two weeks ago.

Greene countered that Gilbrech was the one harassing her and had intended to file her own restraining order but didn't get around to it. 

She has since left the building, where she lived with boyfriend Peter, and must stay at least 20 feet away from Gilbrech and his family.

As well as leaving her home, Greene has also said goodbye to her job after storming out of KTVA's studio after presenting a segment on the Alaska Cannabis Club and revealing she was its owner.

Fight: She later uploaded a video to YouTube, pictured, explaining why she believes weed should be legalized

'And as for this job, well, not that I have a choice but, f*** it, I quit,' she said. 

After the video became an internet hit, Greene released her own YouTube video detailing why she believes marijuana should be legalized in Alaska.

'Why differentiate my toke from your beer,' she asks in the video. 'We smokers are responsible, contributing members to society.' 

Greene is moving on to dedicate herself full time to making sure that measure passes and along with the video has posted an Indiegogo fundraising page to help her in the cause.

On the page, she is asking for $5,000 in donations, which she intends to put toward re-educating voters on the dangers, or lack thereof, of marijuana use. She has raised more than $6,400 so far.

She writes: 'As a member of the media, I've seen the dirty campaign tricks and lies that prohibitionists have been using over the past several months to sway Alaskan voters firsthand.'

The Alaska Cannabis Club connects medical marijuana cardholders with other cardholders who are growing cannabis. On its website, the club bills itself as striking 'a perfect balancing act with Alaska's Medical Marijuana laws'.

Growers are offered 'donations' as reimbursement for the costs of growing the plant, the club said in an interview with Alaska Dispatch News in August.

The club said it hopes to increase access to medical marijuana patients, despite operating in a legal grey area within Alaska's murky medical marijuana laws.

But not everyone is happy about Greene's sudden career change, including KTVA, which took to Twitter to apologize for her outburst on air.

'Viewers, we sincerely apologize for the inappropriate language used by a KTVA reporter on the air tonight,' it wrote. 'The employee has been terminated.'
