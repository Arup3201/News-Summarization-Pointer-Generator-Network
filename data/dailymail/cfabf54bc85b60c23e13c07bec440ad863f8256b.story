The Bank of England governor insisted yesterday that he knew nothing about the manipulation of crucial interest rates until just two weeks ago.

During a grilling by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Sir Mervyn King said he was not aware of the ruthless rigging of rates – even though he was warned about it four years ago.

The governor was sent an email by America’s Federal Reserve Bank in June 2008, which made a clear reference to ‘deliberate misreporting’ of Libor, the interbank lending rate.

Questions: Sir Mervyn King today insisted that the he only learned there had been fraud in interbank lending rates two weeks ago despite evidence the US authorities warned of potential fiddling back in 2008

Asked how he could not have known 
about the problem, Sir Mervyn, who retires next year, said ‘everyone’ 
was concerned about Libor.

But he insisted: ‘That is a million 
miles away from saying that is the same as a deliberate, deceitful 
manipulation of [Libor] submissions in order to make financial gain.

‘There was no suggestion of fraudulent behaviour or wrongdoing or anything of the sort.’

Labour MP John Mann yesterday accused Sir Mervyn of being ‘in denial’ about the rigging of Libor rates.

Sir Mervyn’s deputy Paul Tucker also 
came under fire for failing to react to the note warning about 
irregularities in the Libor rate, signed by Timothy Geithner, now the US
Treasury Secretary.

Advance warning: The email from Timothy Geithner, then head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to Sir Mervyn King in 2008 in which suggestion to reform Libor were attached

The committee heard that Sir Mervyn, left, was warned about the Libor index being 'deliberately misreported' by the then president of the US Federal Reserve Tim Geithner, right, as long ago as 2008

Michael Fallon, a Tory MP, asked 
repeatedly how the words ‘deliberate misreporting’, in the first 
paragraph of the Federal Reserve’s note, could not have triggered alarm.

Mr Tucker, who had been the frontrunner to succeed Sir Mervyn next year, said: ‘I’m not sure I addressed my mind to it.’

Asked by Mr Fallon why the ‘penny did 
not drop at the phrase “deliberate misreporting”’, he added: ‘It did not
set off dishonesty alarm bells.’

But he later admitted there had been 
misreporting, adding: ‘It turns out that, with hindsight, yes, it was 
but it did not set alarm bells ringing at the time, I’m afraid.’

Denial: The hearing of the Treasury committee (pictured) heard how Sir Mervyn told MPs that Barclays was in a 'state of denial' over regulatory concerns with the bank following its rate-rigging scandal

Labour MP Pat McFadden said the 
evidence emerging was increasingly embarrassing for British authorities 
when compared with their American counterparts.

He said: ‘The US authorities all the 
way along have been more worried, hungrier for the story and more active
in pursuing it than we have in the UK.’

But Sir Mervyn said: ‘Neither did the Federal Reserve nor anybody else send us any evidence of misreporting.’

The scandal began with a devastating 
dossier, published by the Financial Services Authority last month, about
the ruthless tactics used by rogue traders at Barclays to fiddle Libor.

Email: Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond wrote to Mr Tucker on his appointment as Deputy Bank of England governor saying 'I am really, really proud of you'

The 44-page report reveals 
extraordinary emails showing how traders promised to celebrate together 
with champagne and cappuccinos if they managed to pull off the con.

In one email, a trader at a different 
bank wrote to ‘Trader G’ at Barclays: ‘Dude. I owe you big time! Come 
over one day after work and I’m opening a bottle of Bollinger.’

The scandal, which is expected to 
spread to at least another seven banks, has triggered the resignations 
of the three most senior executives at Barclays and a £290million fine.

Yesterday Sir Mervyn hinted that 
British regulators had been hindered by light-touch regulation pioneered
under the former Labour government.

He told MPs: ‘I remember very clearly 
before 2007 to be a regulator...was to have no support from anybody. 
Dare I say it, even in Parliament.

‘The consensus was anything that the 
regulator did was to impede the workings of our efficient and dynamic 
financial services industry.’

Sir Mervyn also revealed his 
involvement in the departure of Bob Diamond, the former chief executive 
of Barclays, who resigned just six days after the FSA’s report came out.

The Bank governor summoned the 
Barclays chairman to a meeting at 6pm on Monday, July 2, and made clear 
that Mr Diamond had lost the confidence of the regulators.

He told MPs there were ‘genuine and deep’ concerns about Barclays.

‘It is possible to sail close to the 
wind, once, twice or even three times but when it gets to four or five 
times then you have to look at the captain on the bridge,’ Sir Mervyn 
added.

Scandal: The Libor rate-fixing scandal has already claimed the scalps of bank boss Bob Diamond and two other senior Barclays executives and Sir Mervyn said that the bank 'sailed close to the wind'

Libor, short for London Interbank Offered Rate, is the average interest rate at which banks lend to each other.

It is calculated from daily submissions by 16 leading global banks. Each bank sends details of the rate it pays to borrow money from other banks.

The rate is an indicator of the financial health of a company. Just as countries such as Greece and Portugal can expect to pay more to borrow when their finances are in a poor state, a bank in a perilous position will have to pay a higher interest rate to persuade other financial firms to take the risk of lending to it.

The Libor rate relies on banks being honest about the rate at which they borrow. This is now emerging as one of the reasons why it has been open to abuse.

The rate reflects an estimated $550 trillion worth of loans and derivatives.

It also has an impact on the rates of consumer borrowing, such as mortgages, student loans and credit cards.

Libor rate submissions could therefor increase the interest rates at which the public borrow, potentially leading to higher profits for banks.
