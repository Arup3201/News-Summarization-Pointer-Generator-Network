Kiss bass player Gene Simmons has provoked outrage after saying mentally ill people should just 'kill themselves'.

During a July 31 interview with Songfacts, the rock and roll star said he was unable to 'get along with anybody who's a drug addict and has a dark cloud over their heads and sees themselves as a victim.'

'Drug
 addicts and alcoholics are always, 'The world is a harsh place,'' Simmons said. 'My 
mother was in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany. I don't want to hear
f*** all about 'the world as a harsh place.''

Kiss bass player Gene Simmons says people with mental health issues and drug addiction should take their own lives

Rocker Nikki Sixx called Simmons out for his idiotic statements on Twitter

Simmons continued: 'She gets up every day, 
smells the roses and loves life. And for a putz, 20-year-old kid to say, 'I'm depressed, I live in Seattle.' F*** you, then kill yourself.'

Indeed, the lyricist behind 'Calling Dr. Love' seemed almost gleeful at the prospect of egging someone on towards suicide.

'I
 never understand, because I always call them on their bluff,' he said. 'I'm the 
guy who says 'Jump!' when there's a guy on top of a building who says, 
'That's it, I can't take it anymore, I'm going to jump.' Are you 
kidding? Why are you announcing it? Shut the fuck up, have some dignity 
and jump! You've got the crowd.'

During the interview Simmons did not address whether he would similarly advise original Kiss member Peter Criss, who's 2012 autobiography 'Makeup to Breakup: My Life In and Out of Kiss,' opens with the despondent drummer putting a gun in his mouth.

'Drug addicts and alcoholics are always, 'The world is a harsh place,'' Simmons said. 'My mother was in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany. I don't want to hear f*** all about 'the world as a harsh place''

Simmons comments were immediately met with disgust by both fans and fellow musicians.

'I wonder if @genesimmons would still say how depressed people or addicts should kill themselves if it happened to his wife or kids?' asked Motley Crue bass player Nikki Sixx on twitter.

'I struggled with addiction and depression but found recovery,' Sixx added. 'Would you 
be happy if I killed myself instead? Also my 4 kids wouldnt been born.'

'@genesimmons Really? Depression sufferers should kill themselves? You have no idea how tough depression/suicide survivors like myself are,' wrote Twitter user Colleen M.
