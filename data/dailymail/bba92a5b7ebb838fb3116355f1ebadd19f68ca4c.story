Britain today saw a sunny start to spring as the rain which has blighted the country throughout the winter was finally driven away.

Yesterday winter went out with a bang as hills were carpeted in snow and other areas saw heavy rainfall thanks to two storm systems moving over the UK.

But when the first day of March arrived today, the sun shone across the country, heralding the arrival of spring.

Jolly boating weather: Narrowboats on the Bridgewater Canal in Manchester were able to enjoy the spring sunshine

Floods: Roads in Essex were flooded after heavy rainfall yesterday and overnight

Rescue: A family had to be rescued by firefighters in an inflatable boat after their van got stuck in the floodwater

'There's plenty of sunshine, it's very spring-like,' said a spokesman for the Met Office. 'A good day to kick off spring.'

Continued sun was forecast for the rest of the day across central and southern England and Scotland, with some showers in the North of England.

However, despite the sunny scenes temperatures will remain relatively low, peaking at just 8C (46F) in the South-East.

However, some flood-hit areas have still not recovered from the damage they sustained over the winter, and rainfall yesterday brought further suffering.

Essex Fire and Rescue Service sent an inflatable boat to the scene to retrieve the family.

And
 the pleasant conditions elsewhere will not last long - heavy rain is 
set to sweep across the whole of Britain by tomorrow evening.

Earlier this week it was revealed that this winter had more rain than any in the past 250 years.

Records
 dating back to 1766 - the oldest weather data set in the world - show 
that the winter months this year have been the wettest ever recorded in 
England and Wales.

The 
weather series, which is compiled by the Oxford Radcliffe Observatory on
 behalf of the Met Office, started recording data from 50 weather 
stations in the 18th century.

Today the information comes from thousands of hi-tech stations, which feed powerful computers.

The information shows 17.1in (435mm) of rain fell between December 1 and February 24 this year, beating the previous highest total of 16.6in (423mm) in 1915.

Outlook: The sunny weather today is set to give way to heavy rain across Britain tomorrow

Contrast: The Plynlimon area of the Cambrian Mountains in Mid-Wales was carpeted in snow yesterday
