Tributes have been pouring in for Steve Strange, the front man of pop band Visage who died of a heart attack aged 55 in the Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh yesterday.

But while he is most remembered for his music, the man who helped bring New Romantic style to the world in the 1980s is still having an impact on wardrobes - and make-up bags.

From Cara Delevigne's bold eyebrows to Kim Kardashian's love of contouring and Kelis' wacky approach to facial jewellery, Strange has inspired a generation of daring A-list beauty fans.

Steve, pictured in 2003, often did his own make-up and outrageous looks like this one with heavy eyeliner and blue lipstick have been copied by Lady Gaga, pictured in 2006, right

His more shocking looks are much copied too. Whether Madonna or Lady Gaga, many of the stars who have tried to make headlines with outrageous make-up have been beaten to it by Strange.

Strange himself was no stranger to making headlines for his eye-catching looks, whether it was applying lashings of liquid eyeliner and eyeshadow to long false eye lashes.

He pulled off contouring with aplomb to accentuate his cheekbones and make his face appear slimmer - a look that is championed by Kim Kardashian today.

When she, or one of the other stars to copy Strange, showcase a look, their legions of fans do so as well, with the result that Strange continues to wield enormous amounts of influence on their make-up bags - and by extension ours.

Most notable of all is the return of bold power eyebrows, which have been championed by Cara but rocked by the Visage frontman back in the Eighties before the 22-year-old was even born.

Princess Julia, who starred in Visage's Fade To Grey video, told Femail: 'Steve Strange's passion for style and self expression is a legacy that helped shape the 80s, 90s 00s to the present day. His imagination and flair for dressing is something that is apparent and continues to inspire... he became an icon and well deserved.

'We met in the late 70s and became firm friends, then and now. Clubs, fashion and music were our playground. He experimented with music, gender and art creating a fantastical vision. 

'Permission to parade the most innovative looks our imaginations could conjure up at the New Romantic club The Blitz may be the thing he will be most remembered for... but his imagination didn't stop there, his love of music spurred him on to create Visage initially a studio project with Rusty Egan and Midge Ure which placed him firmly in the limelight as a pioneer of electronic dance. He was the real deal!'

A style icon herself, Julia now works as culture correspondent for iD Magazine and writes for Man About Town.

Madonna wrapped black lines across her face for her new album cover - was she inspired by Steve who applied make-up for a similar effect in 2013 when he attended an exhibition at the V&A?

Speaking about his iconic look to BeautyMART last December, he said: 'I have been lucky to work with great make-up artists Richard Sharah who was responsible for David Bowie's looks and did the Fade to Grey video; Phyllis Cohen in the Eighties and now Lara Himpelman.

'In the early Eighties, at the height of the Blitz Kids days, I usually did my own make-up. I've never used a stylist but for shows, shoots and album covers, it's great to collaborate on the make-up.

'Nowadays, I wear less than I used to - it's mainly sculpting using highlighter and bronzer. I useShu Uemura Cleansing Oil, and skincare. If I've had a night out, I use white kohl to brighten things up a bit. I like Naked Cosmetics, eyeshadows, some lashes and pencils.'

Speaking of the legacy left by Steve, Terry Barber, director of makeup artistry at M.A.C Cosmetics said: 'Steve Strange epitomised the cult of the New Romantic in the early eighties. 

'He was the Post Punk Peacock, a beautiful mix of Geisha, Picasso and Victorian urchin. He crafted the look of the underground scene, a transformation with porcelain skin, graphic lines and carved contours. His videos with Visage are constantly referenced by make-up artists today. A huge loss.'
