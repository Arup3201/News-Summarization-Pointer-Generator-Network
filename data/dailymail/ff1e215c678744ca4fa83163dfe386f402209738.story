The Bank of England today looks set to announce that interest rates could stay at record lows until after the General Election.

Mark Carney, who succeeded Lord King as Governor last month having been hand-picked for the job by George Osborne, is expected to reassure the public that rates will not rise anytime soon.

The Canadian hopes the use of so-called ‘forward guidance’ will boost confidence among households and businesses and help drive the economic recovery.

The Chancellor will also hope that rock bottom borrowing costs between now and polling day in 2015 will bolster Tory chances as house prices rise and optimism returns.

But the prospect of at least two more years of low interest rates will delight borrowers but inflict further misery on savers who have lost out since rates hit 0.5 per cent in March 2009.

It will mark a dramatic change of tack at the Bank which has until now resisted tying its hands by committing to a future path of interest rates.

Experts warned that if the economy picks up sharply in the coming months the Bank could be forced to renege on its promise and raise interest rates sooner than expected - particularly if inflation roars back.

It means Mr Carney, the highest paid central banker in the world on £874,000 a year, faces a difficult balancing act when he outlines his plans today at the Bank’s inflation report.

It is thought that he could peg low interest rates to economic thresholds - such as saying they will not rise until unemployment falls below a certain level as has been done in the United States by the Federal Reserve.

But Brenda Kelly, senior market strategist at City trading firm IG, said the ‘better economic data has complicated the plans of Mr Carney’.

The Bank looks set to raise its growth forecasts for this year and next following a flurry of better economic news in recent months.

But output is still around three per cent below the pre-recession peak reached in early 2008 - meaning this is the longest downturn for a century.

Mr Carney is also likely to be concerned that Britain has been the worst performing economy in the G7 since the start of the financial crisis bar Italy.

It could be enough to persuade him to press ahead with forward guidance today when he responds to Mr Osborne’s request to consider ‘unconventional’ tools to boost the economy.

Mr Carney, former governor of the Canadian central bank, gave a clear taste of forward guidance last month when he signalled that interest rates will not rise for some time.

The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said expectations of an imminent rate rise were ‘not warranted’ - sending stock markets soaring.

Business leaders welcomed the prospect of full-blown forward guidance last night.

Neil Bentley, deputy director-general of the CBI, said: ‘Forward guidance could provide a welcome injection of certainty around interest rates for businesses and consumers.’

David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘Businesses need a stable environment with reassurance that interest rates will remain at very low levels for the foreseeable future.’

David Owen, managing director at investment bank Jefferies International, said: ‘We still expect Mark Carney to introduce forward guidance, probably along with a target for the unemployment rate, reinforcing the view of a Bank Rate likely stuck at 0.5 per cent until just after the General Election.’

James Knightley, an economist at banking group ING, said forward guidance would be a useful tool to prevent expectations of higher interest rates ‘choking off the recovery story’.

But a critic said it could pave the way for problems in the future if the Bank is forced to change its mind and raise rates due to economic developments.

Former MPC member Andrew Sentance said: ‘This is a very difficult environment for central banks wishing to design forward guidance and we should not build up our hopes about its accuracy or effectiveness.’

Allan Monks, economist at JP Morgan Chase Bank, said: ‘It doesn’t take long to see how messy things could get. The decision would only add to the confusion over when rates are likely to rise.’
