Universities would have to apply new aptitude tests and cut the number of drop-outs in plans for a shake-up of the student loans system.

Amid concerns about the long-term viability of the funding system for higher education, senior Conservatives are considering reforms that would reduce its cost and crack down on poor quality degrees.

They include a new minimum qualification for students who qualify for taxpayer-backed loans and an end to the right to charge fees at institutions which see large numbers of students fail to finish courses or find well-paid jobs.

Chancellor George Osborne has announced that the Government is abolish the cap on student numbers in 2015, increasing the cost of taxpayer subsidies to the sector by around £700 million a year.

‘With George Osborne announcing no controls on student numbers, there are fantastic opportunities. Wanting your kid to go to university is an aspiration to join the middle class,’ said a Government source.

‘The graduate repayment scheme is a perfectly solid way of financing graduate education. However, we may need some kind of quality control, because universities will be able to recruit without the old framework on number controls.

So there’s a legitimate question about what would happen if a university was signing up lots of people who couldn’t get through a course and were then dropping out.’

Under the tuition fees regime brought in by the coalition, universities can charge fees of up to £9,000 a year.

Students start paying back loans which cover them once they are earning over £21,000 at a rate of nine per cent of their salary above £15,000. Any debt still owing after 30 years is automatically cancelled by the government.

Paul Kirby, David Cameron’s former policy chief, who is now at KPMG, has drawn up detailed plans for reform.

He said there were too many ‘sub-prime loans’ being made to students doing courses with ‘unsatisfactory completion rates, [which] offer limited chances of graduate level employment and cost students more than they gain financially’.

He said that when the new loans system was brought in, the Government estimated that 35 per cent of money lent would not be repaid. But recently, the National Audit Office has suggested this is likely to be at least 50 per cent.

Forecasts suggest there will be more graduates on low to modest salaries, who will not start paying anything back, while the Student Loan Company is struggling to get payments from those freelancing or in short-term jobs, as well as from EU students overseas.

‘On top of this level of non-payment, there are substantial subsidies for the poorest students who receive maintenance grants and for higher cost courses,’ Mr Kirby said.

‘All in all, it means that the taxpayer will be paying more for university education than it did before the loans were introduced.

In these terms, it is hard to believe how much political capital has been spent on the loans controversy. Armed with these facts, I suspect that political history will label the introduction of student loans as one of the presentational failures of the century.’

He said ‘lines in the sand’ now needed to be drawn about which universities should be attended and which courses followed ‘to protect students and taxpayers from wasting time, effort and money’.

‘One way of doing this would be to say that universities will only be accredited for student loans if they achieve a range of minimum standards,’ he added.

He suggested that a maximum drop-out rate of 20 per cent, disqualifying 20 out of 121 UK universities, and a requirement that 60 per cent of students should get a professional or graduate level job, a test failed by a third of universities.

He also proposed a new entry qualification of 300 Ucas points - or three Bs at A-level - and an expectation that 60 per cent of students should end up with a first class or a 2:1 degree.

The Government source said a ‘three Bs’ requirement would exclude people who left school early and wanted to attend university as a mature student, meaning an ‘aptitude test’ was more likely.

‘This is the start of manifesto work. We will look with interest at what Paul Kirby says,’ the source added.

‘The forecasts on repayments are incredibly sensitive to earnings forecasts and they are going to keep on bouncing around.’

Concern: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned Labour's proposals to cut tuition fees to £6,000 a year would favour wealthy students rather than the less well-off

The source said a small increase in the £9,000-a-year tuition fee charge was also possible, adding: ‘We have been freezing it in cash terms. That isn’t a long-term viable option, but that doesn’t mean some great big increase.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned Labour’s proposals to cut tuition fees to £6,000 a year would favour wealthy students rather than the less well-off.

Mr Clegg said: ‘When they first announced this it was shown by independent commentators that a £6,000 limit would benefit the very richest students who could pay upfront and would not help at all the very poorest.’

Tories say a £6,000 a year cap on fees would mean a £3 billion-a-year black hole in university funding and point out students repay significantly less every month than they did under the last Government’s loans regime.
