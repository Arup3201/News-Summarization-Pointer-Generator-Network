David Miliband has hinted that he may return to Westminster after two years running a charity in the US

David Miliband has hinted that he may return to politics after two years running a charity in the US.

The former Foreign Secretary, who is currently the head of the International Rescue Committee in New York, has revealed that he does not intend to remain in the US or take up citizenship there.

Miliband refused to rule out a return to Westminster telling the Financial Times, 'You just don't know, do you?'

'Tony Blair and John Major have said that they wish they'd done their post-premiership jobs before they became prime minister,' he told the paper.

The Labour leadership was contested by the Miliband brothers in 2010, and was eventually  won by  Ed.

After losing out to his younger brother, Miliband spent some time as a Labour backbencher, before resigning as MP for South Shields and quitting the UK in 2013.

His hint at a return to politics comes as the party is plagued by rumours of discontent surrounding his brother's ability to win the next General Election.

Asked if he saw his IRC position as such a preparation for Number 10, Miliband said: 'That's not the way I conceived it.

'I miss my friends, my neighbourhood, my colleagues, obviously. But I am absolutely sure this is the right place for me and my family to be at this moment,' he said.

'I'm doing something that really speaks to my values and my passions.'

He made a fresh appeal to pro-European forces in the UK to make the case more strongly but said he did not expect the British public would be so 'unbelievably stupid' to vote to leave the EU in a referendum.

'Those on the pro-British - as I call it - pro-European side of the argument have got to make the case that we get far more from being at the table than shouting with a loud hailer outside the room.

'I have this residual faith in the common sense of the British people that generally they don't do stupid things. And it would be unbelievably stupid to walk out of the European Union.'
