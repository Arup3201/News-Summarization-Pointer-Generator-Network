Demonstration: The patch works by disrupting the CO2 flow which humans give off and helps mosquitoes target us

Britain may be bathed in sunshine, 
but for those who find themselves the unfortunate target of mosquitoes, 
the desire to expose skin remains minimal.

But
now a technology firm based in California claims to have the answer - a
patch which makes the wearer invisible to the insects.

The Kite Patch uses non-toxic compounds that disrupt mosquitoes' ability to find people through CO2 for up to 48 hours.

The technology was developed by Olfactor
Laboratories and the University of California at Riverside, with 
backing from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the National 
Institutes of Health.

For most people in Britain bites can be painful, itchy or become infected.

But for large parts of the developing world, it is much more serious.

Mosquitoes spread malaria which killed 660,000 people in 2010, according to the World Health Organisation.

But research published last year suggested the total is actually double that number and closer to 1.2million.

The UN had set a target of eliminating the disease by 2015 but that now looks unlikely.

The countries worst hit are in central and western Africa.

Most deaths occur in children but a fifth also kill people aged 15 to 49.

Crowdfunding website Indiegogo is running a campaign to raise $75,000 to send 20,000 Kite patches for large-scale testing in Uganda, where 
malaria rates are over 60 percent.

'A child dies of the disease every minute of every day. Effective mosquito control can be the difference between life and death', said Kite co-founder Torrey Tayenaka.

Life saver: The Kite Mosquito Patch could help stop the spread of malaria which kills millions every year

From
$35, backers can send 10 patches to Uganda and receive 10 for 
themselves. The patch is designed to be durable and affordable.

It can also be stuck on bags, prams or anything else that needs protecting.

'The Kite Mosquito Patch isnâ€™t just 
another mosquito product, but a powerful alternative to most products on
the market, enabling people to live normal lives with a new level of 
protection against contracting mosquito-borne diseases,' said Michelle 
Brown, the chief scientist and vice president of Olfactor Laboratories, 
Inc.
