A Thai truck driver who knocked down and killed a British couple who were on a round-the-world cycling trip was fined just £18.

Peter Root and Mary Thompson, both 34, left Guernsey in July 2011 and had cycled through Europe, the Middle East and China before reaching Thailand, their 23rd country.

But the couple were killed when they were run over by the driver of a pick-up truck while riding their bicycles on a road 70 miles east of Bangkok in Phanom Sarakham, Chachoengsao in February last year.

The couple were travelling on the hard shoulder when a pick-up truck veered from its lane and struck them

The truck driver Vorawong Sangkawat lost control when he bent down to pick up a hat off the floor of his Toyota truck, according to Thai police.

The lapse in concentration sent his vehicle swerving into the hard shoulder, where it knocked down and killed the couple.

The 25-year-old was arrested and charged with killing them both through negligence.

However, he was given a suspended two-year prison sentence and fined 1,000 Baht, the equivalent of just £18.

A post-mortem examination in Guernsey confirmed that the couple had both suffered severe head injuries consistent with a road traffic accident.

The examination was delayed because of difficulties in obtaining details of the driver's prosecution.

Eventually officials discovered that when Sangkawat appeared in Chacheungsao Provisional Court last year, he pleaded guilty to an offence of causing death by negligence.

The single offence violated several laws and carried a potential sentence of up to 10 years in jail.

But he left court with a two-year suspended sentence because of his guilty plea, remorse and previous good character.

He was also placed under probation service supervision for one year and made to attend a seminar relating to the country's Land Traffic Law.

Mr Root, was an acclaimed artist and lecturer born in Jersey but grew up on the Channel Island of Guernsey.

He met Bristol-born Ms Thompson when they both attended art college in Falmouth, Cornwall, 14 months earlier.

In the wake of their deaths, Peter's father Jerry described them as a 'golden couple' who 'loved life'.

Both of them were highly acclaimed artists who had put on exhibitions all over the UK and as far afield as Istanbul and Bolivia.

Mr Root had work displayed in the Saatchi gallery, while Ms Thompson exhibited at the prestigious Waterman's Gallery in London.

She was also a highly regarded jewellery designer, while Mr Root taught digital media and design at the Guernsey College of Further Education.

An inquest in Guernsey heard they had cycled through the whole of Europe and a number of dangerous places including Iran and Afghanistan.

The couple were keeping a blog called, 'Two on Four Wheels', describing their experiences on their round the world trip

Their online blog, 'Two on Four Wheels' described how they faced extreme weather conditions and even came under gunfire during the 19-month trip of a lifetime.

Judge Philip Robey recorded a verdict of accidental death, saying the medical evidence was consistent with severe head injuries caused by a traffic collision.

In the wake of their deaths, family members set up the Peter Root and Mary Thompson Charitable Trust for the future promotion of the arts and other charitable interests.

Mary's brother Ben, from Bristol, said at the time of their deaths: 'Mary was a ray of sunshine - a hugely positive, gentle person who just loved people and making friends.

'Equally, Pete's dry wit, irreverent sense of humour, generosity and boundless enthusiasm won him friends everywhere he went.

'Many people just talk about their dreams - Mary and Pete actually went out there and lived them.

'The world is undoubtedly a much poorer place for their passing, and they leave behind two heartbroken families and countless friends.'

Thailand is well known for its perilous roads, with more than 13,000 killed and almost 1million injured each year in accidents.
