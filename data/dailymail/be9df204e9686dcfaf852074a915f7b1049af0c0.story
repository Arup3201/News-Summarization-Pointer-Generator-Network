An unwanted Rottweiler has been homeless for five months because her 'mournful face' puts off visitors to the kennels where she is staying.  

The six-year-old Rottweiler cross, Bless, has attracted no interest at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home and staff are convinced it is because she constantly looks gloomy. 

Bless was found on the streets of London as a stray. Despite a loving personality, Bless is always overlooked by visitors to the kennels and is the longest staying resident at the charity's south London Home.

Rob Young, Head of Dog re-homing, said: 'Bless has a mournful face but a heart of gold – anyone who meets her can't believe what a gentle giant she is. 

'Although she looks sad she is an absolute joy to be around – that's why it's so sad for us that she's still in kennels rather than happily established in a loving home.'

Staff at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home hope Bless will attract as much interest as the mournful kitten, who became an internet sensation this Summer.

The sad cat is owned by Ashley Herring, 21, from New Orleans, and became popular after she posted photos to the internet. 

Elsewhere, pictures of a lonely polar bear, Arturo, that emerged last month led to a worldwide campaign to save it.

Half a million people delivered a petition to Argentina’s President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner calling for Arturo to be moved to a cooler climate after photos emerged of him sitting in a concrete enclosure at Mendoza Zoo in Argentina in temperatures of up to 40C (104F).

It was claimed the 29-year-old’s lonely life was causing him to display abnormal behaviour, including tilting his head and showing his teeth while pacing back and forth and rocking from side to side.

He was said to have been depressed since his long-term friend Pelusa died two years ago. 

Despite that, Argentina refused to relocate its lonely polar bear, even though animal rights activists said it was showing signs of stress.

But perhaps people are becoming more obsessed by their pets' image. Last month, the RSPCA announced a rise in the number of black cats being abandoned by their owners, and attributed it to them not photographing well for selfies. 

A spokesman for the animal welfare charity said: 'There are a number of reasons for us having so many black cats, including the fact that black animals tend not to photograph as well as other cats with more distinctive markings.

'We really are puzzled as to why this still happens but we would urge people to never judge a cat by its colour and look at its personality instead.'
