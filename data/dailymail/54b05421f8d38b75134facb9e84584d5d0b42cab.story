The traditional Christmas tree, bristling with pine needles and heavy with baubles, is coming under threat from a new demand for slimmed-down ‘size zero’ models made from little more than twigs.

British families are increasingly decorating their living rooms with the stark, minimalist designs in a trend said to be inspired by bleak TV ‘Scandi-dramas’ such as The Killing and Borgen.

Traditional pines such as the Norway Spruce are being challenged by the fake, leafless wintry skeletons, which tend to come adorned with twinkling LED lights, leaving no room for tinsel, crackers or an angel on the top.

M&S range: This minimalist design being sold in Marks & Spencer fits in with the new 'size zero' tree trend

TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp, known for her love of chintz, will tackle the new Nordic trend in her Channel 4 show Kirstie’s Handmade Christmas on Tuesday.

She somewhat reluctantly confirmed to The Mail on Sunday that the ‘Christmas twig’ will be big this year.

‘There’s a lot of naked trees this year; it’s definitely a trend,’ she said. ‘It’s more confident, more alternative and design-led. It’s not just a case of putting up a tree, shoving some tinsel on it and putting up some decorations.

‘If you’re having a minimalist twig thing then you put very small, very delicate decorations on it. One of the reasons the Scandinavian decorations look so beautiful is because they’re so understated. Those “Scandi” trees do work with just a few decorations.’

Scandinavian design is traditionally minimal, functional and simple.

David Mitchell, the Christmas tree expert for Wyevale garden centres, also spotted the trend, saying: ‘The Ikea generation like clean lines. That’s coming through with Christmas trees as well.’

Major retailers including Tesco, Marks & Spencer, Next, B&Q and Argos are all selling several types of artificial twig tree, as our pictures show.

John Lewis has no fewer than 16 on offer as part of its ‘Copenhagen’ Christmas range. Its pre-lit paper birch tree, the 8ft version of which costs an eye-watering £125, is a bestseller, according to a spokesman. The store is also selling pine scent sticks, so customers don’t miss out on the aroma.

Ms Allsopp admitted a twig tree would not be taking centre stage in her household this Christmas. ‘There’d be a bit of a mutiny if we didn’t have something huge and bushy and glittery,’ the 43-year-old said.

‘But there’s nothing sad about a twig. You can do all sorts of things with them. I wouldn’t have a fake one, though. There’s no need.’
