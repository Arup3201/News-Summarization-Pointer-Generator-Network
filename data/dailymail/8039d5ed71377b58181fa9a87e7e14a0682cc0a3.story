Lachlan Mullen was fit and healthy like most 20-year-old men his age but in 2012, he got the shock of his life when he was diagnosed with lung cancer.

Within months of diagnosis, he was so weak he was unable to stand up long enough to have a shower because of his chemotherapy treatment.

But eventually, a drug changed all that and now Mr Mullen is helping the fight to make other 'life-changing' drugs more readily available to other Australians through a Rare Cancers Australia campaign.

Lachlan Mullen was 20 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer

Mr Mullen's experience with cancer started with a cough.

Six months later - when it did not go away - he went to see a doctor and got a chest X-ray.

Mr Mullen's doctor discovered a tumour growing in his lung and the 20-year-old said he went into 'absolute shock' when he heard the news.

'I was an electrical apprentice, I was a young fit guy and as far as I thought I was perfectly healthy,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

During his chemotherapy, Mr Mullen was so weak he could barely walk

'I worked 45 hours a week and would go to the gym every day and I pretty much felt invincible.'

Mr Mullen said it took about a week for the reality of his situation to sink in but then he came to a crossroads.

'I said to myself: "You can sit around and feel sorry for yourself or you can do everything you can to beat it",' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Mullen - who is now 22 - chose the latter and it was not an easy task.

He started on chemotherapy two months later but by his third cycle he started to struggle.

'I struggled with it and I was hospitalised for a week,' Mr Mullen said.

'I felt my body had shut down, I had to sit in a chair to have a shower because I couldn't stand up long enough to have a shower.'

The now 22-year-old (pictured) had the opportunity to be treated with a 'life-changing' drug worth $90,000 for free

Eventually they took him off chemotherapy when his oncologist found out the Adelaide man had a rare anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation, which meant his cancer could be treated with a different method. 

Mr Mullen's oncologist organised for him to be put on Crizotinib, which was a $90,000 drug that was not available in Australia in 2013.

Luckily for him, Mr Mullen did not have to pay for the drug as his specialist appealed for the treatment on 'compassionate grounds'.

But before he could start treatment, Mr Mullen had to jump two last hurdles - having a brain tumour removed and heart surgery to drain fluid from around the organ.

When he eventually started taking Crizotinib, the young man said he felt better within a couple of weeks.

'I put on weight, I started walking again and within a month or two I was going back to gym and jogging. Before I knew it I was running again,' Mr Mullen said.

'I met up with mates in Europe for three weeks and really started to get my quality of life back – feeling like a 21-year-old again.'

Mr Mullen (back, second from left) said he had a better quality of life on the drug and was helping the fight to make it more readily available to others

Mr Mullen said the drug gave him a better quality of life and he wanted others to benefit from it.

So he has teamed up with Rare Cancers Australia to fight for better access to medicines.

The Sick or Treat campaign aims to help Australians get the best cancer care available. 

It wants 'empower those patients needing costly medicines with the platform to raise money via online campaigns', according tothe campaign's website.

'[Crizotinib] changed my life and people who have been through what I have, I want to help them,' Mr Mullen said.

'If it was six months later, I would have had to pay $90,000.

'It gave me a better quality of life and more time to find the treatment I needed.'

Even though Mr Mullen stopped responding to Crizotinib after six months, he said it gave him a seven-to-eight-month window to find other treatments.

Now he is part of a clinical trial for another ALK inhibitor, Alectinib, which has returned his life 'back to normal'.

Mr Mullen has returned to full-time study at university, last month he participated in 12km bay run and he goes boxing five times a week.

And next year he hopes to return to the football field.
