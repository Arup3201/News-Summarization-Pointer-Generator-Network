The conditions are not exactly ideal for batting. But the water logged pitch doesn't deter the two teams involved in this historic cricket match.

Members of the Royal Southern Yacht Club and Island Sailing Club faced off in their annual grudge and managed to battle it out for at least an hour before the waves washed in and swamped the pitch.

Bramble Bank is a sandbar in the centre of the Solent - the stretch of water between the Isle of Wight and the Hampshire coastline.

It is uncovered only once a year - for about an hour - when the lowest tide reveals a temporary 200-metre-long 'pitch'.

During that time the two sides, the Royal Southern Yacht Club, from Hamble, Hampshire and the Island Sailing Club, from Cowes on the Isle of Wight, sail out from the opposite coasts for their match.

The tradition, which began in the 1950s, includes the teams taking it in turns to win and always ends with a celebratory meal. This year it was the turn of the Islanders, who enjoyed a resounding victory in front of a good crowd.

The sandy wicket only appears for a few minutes on the lowest tide of the year in the middle of the Solent between Cowes and Southampton - just enough time for a quick game before 'tide stops play'

One of the stranger things about an already unusual event is that the rare tide and wind patterns which cause the Bramble Bank lead to a 'mirage' effect, with passing boats seeing cricketers appearing to walk on water

Inmates from Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight were the first to play cricket on Brambles Bank in the 1950s when prison officers believed the convicts couldn't escape The sailing clubs took up the mantle in 1984 and have been battling it out every year since

This year it was the turn of the Islanders, who enjoyed a resounding victory in front of a good crowd according to ISC sailing secretary Chris Thomas
