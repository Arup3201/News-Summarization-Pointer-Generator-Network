A man found critically beaten in a laundromat after at least four minors attacked him with skateboards is now able to speak and says he was trying to break up a fight.

Viktor Silcock was found Friday May 10 in a nearby Huntington Beach, California shopping center on the brink of death after a fight that reportedly began over an iPod.

Police said Silcock was at the city’s Murdy Park, which includes a skatepark, when his girlfriend tried to stop a group of teenagers from fighting.

Brutal: Viktor Silcock was beaten within inches of his life by teenagers wielding skateboards May 10 in Huntington Beach, California

Silcock stepped in and that’s when the teens turned their attention to him.

Accounts at that point vary—some witnesses said they saw Silcock attack the skateboarders with a screwdriver and one of the minors told reporters he was stabbed twice during the scuffle—but what happened next is clear.

‘He remembers going to the park,’ Silcock’s mother Anna Belles told KABC. ‘He remembers seeing other kids fighting. And he remembers running.’

Silcock fled and the teenagers reportedly chased him into Surf City Coin Laundry and beat him into unconsciousness with their skateboards.

Violent: Silcock then reportedly intervened and was then chased into this laundromat, where he was found brutally beaten

Belles described her son’s condition in a letter sent to reporters Tuesday.

‘Our son suffered a severe brain injury from the savage beating he received,’ Belles wrote. ‘While we concentrate on our son's recovery, we trust that our dedicated Huntington Beach police force will keep up with their investigation and bring the perpetrators of this heinous act to justice.’

Four boys aged 14 to 16, all with previous criminal convictions, were booked at Orange County Juvenile Hall for suspicion of attempted murder.

Silcock’s condition has been upgraded 
from critical to serious in the days since his attack. He is able to sit
 up and speak to his family and Belles said has everyone ‘encouraged.’

Help: Silcock's mother said the park, which saw 5 attacks in 2012, needs to be cleaned up

Family: Seen here are some of Belles' other adopted sons and her wheelchair- bound husband Jordan Silcock. The couple has adopted 59 children over the years

Belles’ optimism should not come as a surprise to anyone in Orange County, where the adoptive mother of 59 disabled children has long been well-known.

Viktor was adopted by Belles and her husband Jordan Silcock at age 12. He reportedly grew up with learning disabilities and will likely face surgeries and more adversity as he fights to recover from the attack.

‘I feel really compelled to try to help my city heal from this and, in some way contribute to making the park safer for everybody,’ Belles said.

Murdy Park is no stranger to crime and violence. Five incidents of battery were reported in the park in 2012 along with nine incidents of drug possession. Two years prior, in 2010, a man was murdered in the park.
