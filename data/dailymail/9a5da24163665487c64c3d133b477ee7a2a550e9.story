It's not known if she leaves the toilet seat up after she uses it, but Johnie the crocodile loves nothing more than a good soak in the tub.

That's what was revealed in a recent video when the croc's owner Vicki Lowing from Melbourne captured bath time in her house. 

The video was uploaded to YouTube this week, and shows Lowing calling to 18-year-old freshwater croc Johnie who is 1.5 metres long and weighes 12kg.

Bath time: 18-year-old freshwater croc Johnie is 1.5 metres long, weighes 12kg and loves a good soak in the tub

Johnie walks down through Vicki Lowing's house in Melbourne to get her daily bath

The 57-year-old nurse claims that the crocodiles she has had were always totally domesticated

With the sound of the bath being run in the background Johnie walks down through Lowing's house to the bathroom. 

'Come on let's have a bath,' Lowing says. 'There's a girl. Get in that bath. Come on buddy. I'll help you get in.'

Lowing is true to her word and once the croc gets to the bathroom she lifts it into the half full bath.

'That's better isn't it? How's that?' asks Vicki. 

Johnie doesn't have to answer - the image of her floating contentedly in the bath says it all. 

Nicknamed 'croc lady' in Melbourne, Lowing, has owned crocodiles for more than 30 years. She claims they have all been totally domesticated and that she can even communicate with them telepathically.

Lowing said she first became fascinated with the animals after watching a film in the 1960s, and she has never looked back. 

Amazingly, despite Johnie nipping her a decade ago while ill, the 57-year-old nurse has never sustained any injuries.

She admits neighbours keep their distance when she has taken her pets for walks but on the plus side she has never had problems with burglars.

Over the years it would not be unusual for her son Andrew, now 20 years old, to wake up with Johnie on his bed - just like any family pet.
