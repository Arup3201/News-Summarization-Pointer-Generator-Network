The Jacksonville Jaguars have devised a new scheme to get fans to purchase game tickets: offer free beer.

The Florida NFL team announced the move on Thursday in anticipation of Sunday's game against the Indianapolis Colts.

The Jaguars' Twitter posted the following message offering fans an incentive to purchase tickets: '2 free drinks for next 2 hrs w/ #INDvsJAX ticket purchase (starting @$45, 21+ for beer). #DrinksOnUS from @Bud Light.'

The team repeatedly advertised the offer for the next two hours, in the hope of getting fans' attention.

On Thursday the team later posted '#DrinksOnUs presented by Bud Light #INDvsJAX is officially closed. Thank you to everyone who took part and see you Sunday!'

The Jaguars have not had a winning season since 2007, TIME reports.

They are currently 0-3, after losing to the Kansas City Chiefs, the Oakland Raiders, and the Seattle Sehawks, according to CBS.

NFL.com reports that the Jaguars are probably trying to avoid a local TV blackout.

The NFL adopted the blackout rule in 1975, Fox News reports, and basically blocks local TV stations from broadcasting games in home markets if a stadium does not sell out 72 hours before kickoff. It also prevents cable and satellite providers from carrying the games.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which also currently hold a 0-3 record, recently promised fans that the rest of the home games for the 2013 season will not be blacked out, NFL.com reports.
