An international team of astronomers has discovered a large planet floating freely through space with no star to orbit.

Planets traditionally travel in a uniform, singular direction, around a star. However, the free-floating planet, named PSO J318.5-22, has been found without a host.

Its movement isn't structured, scientists do not understand how it formed and they are baffled by what - if anything - controls it.

Orbits are created by a balance between the forward motion of a body in space, such as a planet or moon, and the pull of gravity on it from another body, such as a large planet or star.

An object with a large mass goes forward and wants to keep going forward; however, the gravity of another body in space pulls it in.

There is a continuous tug-of-war between the one object wanting to go forward and away and the other wanting to pull it in.

These forces of inertia and gravity create the orbit.

If the movement of one object is too strong, the object speeds past the other and doesn't enter orbit.

If the movement is weaker than the pull of gravity, the object will be pulled into the other one and crash.

When a planet doesn't have a star, in theory, it should carry on moving and not remain still because there are no forces in place keeping it there.

PSO J318.5-22 appears to be staying relatively still but doesn't have a host star to keep it in place.

PSO J318.5-22 was detected 80 lightyears away from Earth and it is estimated to have a mass six times that of Jupiter.

Astronomers believe it formed 12 million years ago, and is considered a newborn in planetary terms - Earth is thought to be around 4.5 billion years old. 

Dr Michael Liu of the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii identified the rogue planet from its 'faint and unique heat signature'.

He used the Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) wide-field survey telescope on Haleakala, Maui to make the discovery, before following it up using other telescopes across Hawaii to validate his claims and make sure the find wasn't a fluke.

These follow-up observations found that PSO J318.5-22 has all the same properties of other gas-giant planets found orbiting around young stars - yet PSO J318.5-22 is all by itself.

'We have never before seen an object free-floating in space that that looks like this.

'It has all the characteristics of young planets found around other stars, but it is drifting out there all alone,' explained Liu.

'I had often wondered if such solitary objects exist, and now we know they do.'

Extrasolar planets, or planets found outside the solar system, have been discovered at various points over the past decade.

Around a thousand of these were found when their host stars began wobbling or dimming because of the pull of the planet. However, only a small amount of these planets have been directly imaged, all of which are around young stars less than 200 million years old.

Astronomer Dr. Liu used the Pan-STARRS 1 wide-field telescope on Maui to make the discovery. PSO J318.5-22, pictured, was discovered during a search for failed stars known as brown dwarfs. Brown dwarfs are faint and are red in colour. PSO J318.5-22 stood out because it was 'redder than even the reddest known brown dwarfs'

PSO J318.5-22 is one of the lowest-mass free-floating objects known, perhaps the very lowest, according to Liu. But its most unique aspect is its similar mass, colour, and energy output to these directly imaged planets.

'Planets found by direct imaging are incredibly hard to study, since they are right next to their much brighter host stars.

'PSO J318.5-22 is not orbiting a star so it will be much easier for us to study. It is going to provide a wonderful view into the inner workings of gas-giant planets like Jupiter shortly after their birth,' said Dr. Niall Deacon of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany.

Based on its distance and motion through space, the team concluded that PSO J318.5-22, shown in red, belongs to a collection of young stars called the Beta Pictoris moving group

PSO J318.5-22 was discovered during a search for the failed stars known as brown dwarfs. Due to their relatively cool temperatures, brown dwarfs are very faint and are red in colour.

Liu and his colleagues have been mining the data from the PS1 telescope for many years.

PS1 scans the sky every night with a camera sensitive enough to detect the faint heat signatures of brown dwarfs.

PSO J318.5-22 stood out because it was 'redder than even the reddest known brown dwarfs.'

Infrared spectra taken with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility
 and the Gemini North Telescope showed that PSO J318.5-22 was not a 
brown dwarf, based on signatures in its infrared light that are best 
explained by it being young and low-mass.

'We often describe looking for rare celestial objects as akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. So we decided to search the biggest haystack that exists in astronomy, the dataset from PS1,' said Dr. Eugene Magnier of the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

Dr. Magnier leads the data processing team for PS1, which produces the equivalent of 60,000 photos every night.

Astronomers from Sweden and Finland believe orphan planets with no parent star can form in tiny, cold dust clouds in space.

Research has shown there could be as many as 200 billion 'free-floating' planets in our galaxy alone.

Until now it was assumed that such 'rogue planets' must have been ejected from their solar systems. But new observations point to the likelihood of some free-floating worlds forming on their own.

Astronomers
 used several telescopes to observe the Rosette Nebula, a huge cloud of 
gas and dust 4,600 light years from Earth in the constellation of 
Monoceros, the Unicorn.

The nebula is home to more than 100 of the unusual planet-forming clouds, dubbed 'globulettes'. Each has a diameter less than 50 times the distance between the Sun and the planet Neptune.

Dr
 Carina Persson, from Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, 
Sweden, said: 'We found that the globulettes are very dense and compact,
 and many of them have very dense cores.

'That
 tells us that many of them will collapse under their own weight and 
form free-floating planets. The most massive of them can form so-called 
brown dwarfs.'

The scientists believe countless 
millions of nebulae such as the Rosette have bloomed and faded away 
during the Milky Way’s long history. Many could have given birth to 
free-floating planets. 

The total dataset to date is about 
4,000 terabytes, bigger than the sum of the digital version of all the 
movies ever made, all books ever published, and all the music albums 
ever released.

By regularly
 monitoring the position of PSO J318.5-22 over two years with the 
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the team directly measured its distance 
from Earth.

Based on 
this distance and its motion through space, the team concluded that PSO 
J318.5-22 belongs to a collection of young stars called the Beta 
Pictoris moving group that formed about 12 million years ago.

The
 eponymous star of the group, Beta Pictoris, has a young gas-giant 
planet in orbit around it, yet PSO J318.5-22 is even lower in mass than 
the Beta Pictoris planet and 'probably formed in a different fashion.'
