The federal government says it's disappointed by Russia's trade sanctions on Australia which block exports worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year.

Russia has banned on agricultural products from Australia and other western countries after they imposed their own sanctions against Moscow over its policy in Ukraine following the MH17 disaster.

The retaliatory ban covers all imports of meat, fish, milk and milk products and fruit and vegetables.

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday the 'full embargo' would come into effect immediately and last for one year, unless 'our partners demonstrate a constructive approach' in regards to sanctioning Russia.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says it's disappointing that Russia has retaliated rather than adhere to international concern and stop the flow of weapons to Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine.

It's believed Russia supplied the weapon that was used to down flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine, killing 298 people, including 38 Australians.

'The Australian government will do everything in its power to minimise the impact on Australian agricultural producers,' she told AAP in a statement.

Australia had acted in line with others in the international community in imposing sanctions on Russia, she said.

Russia's sweeping move will cost western farmers billions of dollars but could also lead to empty supermarket shelves in Russian cities. Â 

'Of course this is a serious decision for the suppliers of such foods from these countries,' Mr Medvedev said.

The ban will not cover baby food and people will still be able to buy the banned products abroad if they want, but Mr Medvedev warned those who tried to profit from reselling them would be 'harshly punished'.

The full list of banned products was published on the government's website as Mr Medvedev delivered his speech to a government meeting.

Experts said that local producers would find it hard to fill the gap left by the ban, as the nation's agricultural sector had continued to suffer from poor efficiency and shortage of funds.

The damage to consumers inflicted by the ban would be felt particularly hard in big cities like Moscow, where imported food filled an estimated 60-70 percent of the market.

Mr Medvedev said Russia could go further and ban western carriers from flying over Russia on flights to and from Asia - a move that would significantly swell costs and increase flight time.

He said there has been no decision on that yet, and wouldn't specify when and under what conditions the move could be taken.

He made it clear that Russia hoped the sanctions would make the west revise its policy and stop trying to pressure Russia with sanctions.

'We hope our partners will put a pragmatic economic approach above bad policy considerations, and they will start thinking instead of trying to scare us,' he said.

The decision shows that President Vladimir Putin has no intention of bowing to western pressure over Ukraine and will instead try to strike back at the west.

The U.S. and the EU have accused Russia, which annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March, of fomenting tensions in eastern Ukraine by supplying arms and expertise to a pro-Moscow insurgency, and have imposed asset freezes and loan bans on a score of individuals and companies.
