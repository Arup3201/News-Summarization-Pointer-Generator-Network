With temperatures predicted to fall below zero during Super Bowl Sunday, you can easily forgive Broncos and Seahawks players taking time out of their pre-match preparations to work on techniques for tackling the cold.

Super Bowl XLVIII, which will be played in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, is likely to be among the chilliest events in NFL history, with the ongoing Arctic front hitting the U.S.'s north eastern coast likely to send temperatures plummeting to around -2C by the time the teams kick off at 6.30pm.

With the cold weather likely to have a major impact on the game, it's little surprise that both teams are turning to technology, including expensive heated benches, to ensure the low temperatures don't get the best of their star players.

With the cold weather likely to have a major impact on the game, it's little surprise both teams are desperately trying to ensure the low temperatures don't get the best of their star players

Working out exactly how the Seahawks and Broncos plan to thwart the cold depends on who you ask.

Seahawks backup quarterback Tarvaris Jackson recalled asking teammates for advice about handling the temperature during his NFL debut as a rookie with the Minnesota Vikings. The game was at Chicago in December 2006, and the wind chill put the temperature around -17.

Daytime high temperatures at the MetLife Stadium will be 38F (3C), while the low will be 32F (0C)

'A lot of the guys were like, 'When it gets that cold, there's nothing you can do,' Jackson said.

Although Super Bowl XLVIII is unlikely to see temperatures dropping anywhere close to that low, a number of techniques picked up by players during rookie matches in the extreme cold are almost certain to be on display.

Tubs of Vaseline and long-sleeves shirts are two essential items in the battle to keep warm.

By rubbing Vaseline on their arms, players create a layer of insulation that fills their pores and braces them against the wind.

Broncos safety David Bruton finds another benefit, too: 'When it's cold and your skin's dry [and you get] a scrape on the helmet, next thing you know, you're bleeding profusely. Just because your skin is so dry, it's easier to get cut. That lotion helps.'

His teammate, kick returner Trindon Holliday, disagrees: 'I don't use those kinds of things. (The key is) basically just keeping your mind off the cold.'

Although long-sleeves are outwardly a
 fairly obvious solution, wearing an undershirt beneath their team 
jersey is something few players are willing to consider.

Denver safety Duke Ihenacho was among many who said they definitely wouldn't wear one, no matter how cold it gets: 

Preparation: Both Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks (left) and Knowshon Moreno of the Denver Broncos (right) have been training in the cold of New Jersey before Sunday's big Super Bowl XLVIII clash

Drift: Snow is still piled high outside the main entrance to MetLife Stadium. Temperatures may hit as low as -2 during Sunday's Super Bowl clash

Cold job: Workers shovel snow off the seating area at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey as crews were tasked with removing snow ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl XLVIII

He said: 'I feel like having sleeves is like wearing a sweater. Makes me feel too heavy.'

One key piece of kit that definitely separates the amateur circuit from the big leagues are heated benches.

Both sidelines will have 70 feet of heated benches that can be 
turned up by each team to its desired temperature - up to 90 degrees 
hotter than the air, the NFL said.

Denver Broncos safety Michael Huff is one player keen to seek out a spot.

He said: 'Once you're in the 
game and running around, the adrenaline's flowing, you're fine. When you
 come to the sideline is when you really know it's cold outside. So I 
use the heated benches.'

Seattle center Max Unger will stay away from the benches however, saying: 'I try not to get too warm 
on the sideline. It's kind of a happy medium, I guess... [But] I don't like it to be too much of a shock when 
you get back out there on the field.'

In warmer times: Super Bowl organisers are hoping to have the famous MetLife stadium and its surrounding areas free of snow by the time the teams kick off on Sunday

Super Bowl XLVIII will be played in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium. It is likely to be among the coldest matches in NFL history, with the ongoing Arctic front continue to chill the U.S.'s north eastern coast

Another high-tech technique for keeping warm during the match will be giant Tornado space heaters that are  placed along each sideline when it gets cold. Players often can be seen huddling around, getting a bit of warm air.

Seattle's defensive end Cliff Avril loves them, saying: 'We'll be fine, as long as we have ... those heaters out there.'

Denver tight end Jacob Tamme is not so sure, however. He said: 'I'm really a no-heater guy.'

All the space heaters and temperature controlled benches in the world will make little difference to the players if they fail to follow the oldest advice in the book when it comes to keeping warm on the playing field, however.

From top NFL stars to eight-year-old's playing Sunday league football, the advice is simple: keep moving.

Movement gets blood circulating around the body, stopping your body temperature falling as dramatically as it would if you were standing still.

So as the temperature in New Jersey plummets late on Sunday afternoon, expect to see plenty of not-in-play players doing lunges and star-jumps in the corner of your television screen.
