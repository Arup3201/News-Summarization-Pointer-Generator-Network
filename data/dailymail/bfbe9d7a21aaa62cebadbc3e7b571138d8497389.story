Manchester United scouts continued to gather information
over the weekend ahead of a busy summer spending spree.

Manager Davis Moyes, who believes his squad may need as many
as eight new players, was in Freiburg on Friday watching talented German
defender Matthias Ginter. He also took in Bayern Munich's 5-1 humbling of
Schalke where Toni Kroos was again influential.

Club scouts watched Porto's Brazilian full-backs Danilo and
Alex Sandro in Porto's 2-2 draw with Vitoria Guimaraes on Sunday, although Porto
centre-back Eliaquim Mangala did not play.

United scouts were also posted at Inter Milan against Roma
where on-off target Mehdi Benatia, the 26-year-old Roma centre-back, impressed,
while Moyes's staff were also interested observers as Edinson Cavani made his
return from injury on Sunday.

The £56m-rated striker has been out since January 31 with a
thigh injury but came off the bench and scored PSG's second goal
in a 2-0 win over Marseille.

Moyes's brother Kenny was in the stands last week to see
Slovenia striker Roman Bezjak continue his rich vein of form for Ludogorets by
scoring his eighth Europa League of the season against Lazio.

However, the
25-year-old is not considered to be at United's desired level.

Moyes enjoyed a rare free weekend because United did not have a Premier League game scheduled, so flew to watch Ginter just hours after the 20-year old earned his first Germany call-up.

Ginter is one of four newcomers in Germany’s squad for this Wednesday’s friendly with Chile, and has also attracted strong interest from Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in recent months

Moyes has now joined the chase for the 6ft 2in defender, who is under contract until 2018 but is expected to be available for as little as £7.2million.
