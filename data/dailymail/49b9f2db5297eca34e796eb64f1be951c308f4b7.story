Backing out: Stanford quarterback Josh Nunes retired after suffering a complete tear of his right chest muscle

The former starting quarterback at Stanford University has ended his short football career following a gruesome injury he suffered while weightlifting.

Josh Nunes retired yesterday after a complete tear of his right chest muscle, cutting short a collegiate career filled with dramatic highs and devastating injuries.

Nunes' father, Tim, told The Associated Press that his son ruptured his pectoralis major tendon while doing his normal bench-press routine during an offseason workout in February.Â 

He dropped the weights on his chest - though the tendon had already ruptured - and had surgery a few days later to reattach it with screws.

The tendon connects the pectoral muscle to the humerus bone in the arm.

No further damage was caused by the falling weights other than some bumps and bruises.

Josh is expected to make a full recovery, but it will take time - up to 12 months following surgery - but he says it's not worth risking an even more serious injury he could suffer on the field in 2013.

'The injury shouldn't have happened and we're not sure why it happened,' Tim Nunes said. 'It's not something that could've been prevented.

'Doctors told us it's rare for quarterbacks. Just a freak accident.'

Nunes is finishing his bachelor's degree
in management science and engineering. He already has been accepted 
into the master's program at Stanford for social psychology.

'I don't think you've heard the last of him,' his father said.

To top it all off, the bizarre injury was not Nunes' first.

On the third practice of training camp 
in 2011, Nunes dropped back to pass and stepped on running back Andrew 
Stutz's foot, tearing a ligament underneath his right big toe.

He was in a boot through the first five 
games and had a steel plate that was completely rigid in his shoe when 
he returned to practice.

He never played a down.

Returning to the field last year, Nunes beat out Brett Nottingham in an eight-month quarterback competition.

However, he faced near-impossible expectations last season succeeding record-setting quarterback Andrew Luck, the No. 1 overall draft pick selected by the Indianapolis Colts last April.

Nunes played spectacularly in the second half to upset then-No. 2 Southern California and rallied the Cardinal from a two-touchdown deficit for a 54-48 overtime win against Arizona, but he struggled for long stretches in close losses at Washington and Notre Dame, with the offense failing to score a touchdown each time.

Nunes completed 52.8 per cent of his passes and threw for 1,643 yards, 10 touchdowns and seven interceptions last season.

This season, the junior was likely to be the backup of Kevin Hogan, whose role increased more and more in last season's games.

After Nunes failed to move the 
offense on the first two possessions at Pac-12 cellar-dweller Colorado, 
Hogan came on in Nunes' relief and the never relented - leading the Cardinal's 
remarkable run to a Rose Bowl victory over Wisconsin.
