A mother-of-three has survived deadly meningitis three times after the bug infiltrated her brain via a hole in her skull.

Janine Blackhurst, now 39, was first struck down with meningitis when she was five and then went to catch different strains when she was 33 and then 37, just weeks before her wedding day.

It was not until the third bout that doctors discovered the hole in her skull, next to her sinuses, that was exposing her brain to the bacterial and viral infections.

Janine, 39, (pictured on her wedding day in 2011) has survived meningitis three times. She married shortly after her third encounter with the deadly condition which left her temporarily unable to walk. Three months after her wedding she underwent surgery to close the hole in her skull that was making her prone to the infection

Mrs Blackhurst caught the meningococcus strain of the bug when she was five-years-old. She responded well to treatment and made a full recovery.

She then enjoyed good health - apart from frequent colds and flu - until October 2007, when she was rushed to hospital again.

Mrs Blackhurst, then 33, was diagnosed with meningitis again but this time it was the pneumococcal strain.

She said: 'I thought I’d been unlucky to get it the first time so I couldn’t believe it when they said I had it again.'

After spending two weeks in hospital on strong antibiotics, she was finally allowed home.

Tests showed Janine had a weak immune system and doctors believed that she had probably contracted meningitis a second time because of this. She was given a series of injections to help boost her immune system.

But in 2011 - and just weeks before she was due to marry her partner Stephen Blackhurst, 34 - she was struck down with the same strain of the bug again.

Janine (pictured with husband Stephen on their honeymoon) was born with a small hole in her skull which opportunistic bacteria used as a gateway to her brain. When she caught meningitis for the third time, paramedics said her temperature was so high that 'she was cooking inside'

Janine, who works in a chip shop, said: 'I developed what I thought was a migraine and took myself to bed only to wake at 6am with the worst pains in my head I’d ever experienced.

'By the time the ambulance arrived, I was fitting and lashing out. The paramedics couldn’t do anything with me.

'I’d become violent as well because of the temperature and I wasn’t responding to the medication they were giving me.

'They then rang for a doctor to come from the hospital to sedate me so they could get me out of the house.'

Paramedics told her worried daughter, Bobbi-Jo Caffery, 19, that her mother’s temperature was so high, she was ‘cooking from the inside out.’

At hospital, doctors kept her in a darkened room and ran brain scans. Initially, they thought Janine had suffered a brain haemorrhage but a lumbar puncture revealed she actually had pneumococcal meningitis.

Ms Blackhurst said she lokoed as if she had suffered a stroke. When she woke from her coma, she could not talk, walk or feed herself

Mrs Blackhurst was immediately given
intravenous antibiotics to fight the infection and spent eight 
days in a coma in intensive care while doctors battled to save her.

When she woke up, she couldn’t talk, walk or feed herself. She said: 'All my left side seemed to be worse and my left eye wouldn’t open. I looked like I’d had a stroke.

'All I wanted to do was go home as I was due to get married in ten weeks. I was devastated. We’d cancelled the wedding once already back in 2009.

'I told Stephen to call it off but he, Bobbi-Jo and my gran persuaded me to change my mind.

'It was something to work towards. I was determined to get myself better. Everything was organised and paid for.'

Brain scans showed that Mrs Blackhurst had a very small hole in her skull (right) which had made her brain prone to infection. During surgery to fix the hole they then discovered that a small amount of brain had grown through the skull which had had to be removed

It was at this point that doctors discovered Janine had a 
hole in her skull, just behind her sinuses. They believed that this had exposed her brain to both the bacterial and viral forms of meningitis.

To close the hole in Mrs Blackhurst's head, surgeons removed bone from her leg (pictured after doctors extracted a small amount of bone) and grafted it onto the skull

After three weeks in hospital, Mrs Blackhurst was discharged and with the help of physiotherapy she took her first steps.

She was referred to a specialist who told her she needed an operation to fill the hole to reduce the risk of her contracting meningitis again - and they could use bone from her leg to do it.

Janine decided to go ahead with the wedding and doctors agreed to postpone theoperation.

She said: 'It was a lovely day especially considering I nearly didn’t make it. It was emotional for me but I think even more so for Stephen and my family as they were the ones who had to see me so ill.'

A month later, Janine went into hospital for the operation. Surgeons were left stunned when what they initially thought might be a polyp, an abnormal growth, in her left nostril was actually piece of her brain that had grown through the hole.

Janine said: 'It had grown through the hole and died so they cut it out. I couldn’t quite believe it when they told me. It was weird.

Having a defect in the skull which exposes the brain to infection is not unheard off, according to specialist research and education manager Jane Blewitt of the Meningitis Trust.

She said: 'A group of pneumococcal bacteria that cause minor infections are very opportunistic and have been known, on rare occasions, to use a small hole in the skull as a gateway to the brain.'

Mrs Blackhurst was in hospital for five days and was then released with dressings packed into my nose to keep the bone graft in place.'

A week later, doctors confirmed the operation had been a success. Janine said: 'It was such a relief.

'I wasn’t well enough to go on the honeymoon so we had to postpone. We’ve just got back home. We went to Majorca and it was well worth the wait.

'I’m so lucky because things could have been very different. I’m lucky to be alive.'
