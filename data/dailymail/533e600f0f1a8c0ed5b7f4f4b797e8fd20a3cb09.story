Claudia Winkleman has received heavy criticism for her makeup and hair choices

In a world of blonde glamazon TV presenters, Claudia Winkleman stands out.

She's a teeny 5ft 2in, is very often mahogany thanks to her love  of fake tan, and has a fringe so long she can barely see through it. As for her love of eyeliner; she makes the Middleton ladies look restrained.

And while most female presenters sashay down the red carpet perfectly coiffed in revealing designer dresses, well, Claudia's a bit different there too. At the BAFTAs last month she attracted almost as much attention as Angelina Jolie, but not necessarily for the right reasons.

Most people were asking if she did her make-up in the dark.

The answer is not quite in the dark, but in the back of a cab on the way to the event. The result was wonky, smudged eyeliner that snaked half-way down her cheek.

'Oh, I've lost my make-up artist so much work,' she groans, head in her hands. What, she actually had a make-up artist that day?

'Oh no, not for the BAFTAs,' she laughs. 'Only for when I'm working. Having one for the BAFTAs would feel ridiculous, very J-Lo. Normally if I'm at an event and there are superstars there no one gives a monkey's what I'm wearing. At least, not unless my make-up is magnificently bad.'

She says that on the day of the BAFTAs she got dressed in a hurry and did her eyeliner 'blind' in the cab. When she glanced in her compact mirror she was 'genuinely delighted' as she's always liked a bit of smudge. 'Only this time I may have overdone it.'

Being a non-model in a world full  of them, Claudia's safety mechanism is to always look the same and not compare herself - particularly to her Strictly Come Dancing co-star Tess Daly.

'I'm a weird, dark-haired, orange person,' she says. 'Tess is stunning, the most beautiful creature on Earth. We're so different I can't even try to compare us. If I did I'd never leave the house. I've never really experimented with my looks but whatever experimentation there was has long gone. Orange skin, white lips, smudged eye-make-up and a fringe make me happy. So I'm going with that.'

If people have strong opinions about the eye-liner it's nothing compared with the fuss about the fringe.

It hit its height last year when she appeared on the first series of reality show The Great British Sewing Bee and it became known as the most irritating fringe on TV. There was even a Twitter account dedicated to it.

At the BAFTAs last month Claudia was continually asked if she'd put her makeup on in the dark...turns out she'd put it on in a taxi

Claudia, 42, reveals that before filming started on this year's show a producer told her she needed to get it cut. 'I was properly told to cut it,' she whispers huskily. 'They said, “This is getting ridiculous.”'

Who said? 'I'd better not tell you because then I'd definitely lose my job, but they said, “I'm not sure what point you're trying to make with it.” So I squeaked, “I'm not trying to make a point.” So they said, “Good. Cut it.”'

But isn't it nicer to be able to actually see? 'Well I've never been able to see, I've had a gazillion operations on my eyes anyway (she's severely short-sighted and has had laser treatment to improve her vision). But I do live in a strange paradox.

'My daughter has a fringe and I'm obsessed with cutting it so she can see when she goes to school. Mine's getting longer while hers is above her eyebrows. I feel naked if it's too short and, trust me, no one would want to see my forehead. You would be physically sick. At Radio 2 recently I saw Chrissie Hynde from The Pretenders in reception and her fringe swept down to her chin. She had to part it to talk to people. That's where I'll end up, I hope. I won't be able to do that in TV, but in life I hope that's where I'll be.'

When presenting The Great British Sewing Bee, Claudia was told to cut her fringe as it was 'getting ridiculous'

For now Claudia's so busy her fringe will have to stay above her eyes. Her most high-profile role is presenting Strictly's Sunday night results show and filling in for Bruce Forsyth if he takes time off.

She insists she could never see herself filling his shoes for good though. 'Bruce will definitely be back. I'd never want to take over from him. I'd be terrified.'

She's also presenting the second series of Sewing Bee, has her arts show on Radio 2 and presents Film 2014. And next Friday she'll be one of the main anchors for Sport Relief. She says she was amazed at the sporting antics of her friend Davina McCall, who  did a 500-mile triathlon for the charity. 'I was aghast. Although I'd love to do anything I can for this charity - they astound me with what they do - I've never done any exercise so I couldn't do that.'

'I've exceeded all my ambitions. All my jobs are dream jobs.'

As well as showing us Davina's trials, the fundraising marathon will include a special edition of Only Fools And Horses starring David Beckham and there'll be a Strictly Come Dancing special featuring four paralympians. Meanwhile two celebrity teams, headed by Olympic champ Lord Coe and comedian John Bishop, will compete in sporting challenges at the Olympic Park live on the show.

The teams, which include Andrew Flintoff, Nick Grimshaw, Olly Murs and Sally Phillips, will perform events such as rhythmic gymnastics, track cycling and swimming. Expect mishaps.

'We've got lots of brilliant people also hosting, like Clare Balding and Gabby Logan and Gary Lineker as well as Davina, so I'm just going to take my cue from them,' insists Claudia. 'That's the key. Follow them.'

She's terribly self-effacing when she talks; it's hard to know how much she means it. A Cambridge graduate whose mother Eve Pollard was a Fleet Street editor and father Barry Winkleman a publisher, she says while she was ambitious once, she isn't any more.

'I've exceeded all my ambitions. All my jobs are dream jobs.'

In the past her work schedule - and its clash with that of her husband, film producer Kris Thykier - led to problems between them, but they seem to have things sorted now.

She gave up Strictly's companion evening show It Takes Two so she could be at home more for their children, Jake, ten, Matilda, seven, and Arthur, two. And in the summer the family decamped for nine weeks to Brazil where Kris was making his latest movie Trash, due out this year.

Not working for those weeks made her realise just how much she loved her job; that it wasn't just to keep the kids in Lego. 'I'd never want to do too much because things suffer at home but I also know now that I'd be rubbish if I did nothing. When I was with the kids all the time things felt hectic and I got a bit screechy. I used to say to my son when he was young that I had to work to buy bananas. One evening I was leaving and he was upset and said, “Mummy, you don't have to go, we've got bananas.” So I told him the truth; I like working. I like being with people and using my brain.'

Kris, who produced One Chance, last year's film about Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts, used to be known as a man-about-town while Claudia's always been a homebody ('I went to a nightclub once, and I thought it was too noisy and a fire hazard'). Now he seems tamed.

While she was at the BAFTAs, he was taking the children dry-slope skiing. 'I love him so much,' she says with a fond smile. 'He's obsessed with teaching our kids to ski even though neither of us has done it. He's adorable.' Her perfect weekend would be spent 'lolloping' with the family. 'I love being inside,' she says. 'If I can get my daughter sewing with me - nothing more than a few cuffs because if you think my eyeliner's wonky, you should see my sewing - and the baby's wandering around trying to sit on the kitten and my big son's reading on the sofa with his dad, I'm in heaven.

'I was born this dull,' she adds. 'But the wild years are coming. I love getting older and when I'm 62 I plan to be wearing a kaftan. I'll have eyeliner all over my face and my fringe will be down to my waist. I'll go nuts.'
