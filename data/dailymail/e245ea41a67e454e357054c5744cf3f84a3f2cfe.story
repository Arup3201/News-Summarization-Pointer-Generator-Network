The Mars Curiosity Rover has been caught on camera as it makes its way to an unexplored mountain on the red planet, leaving weaving set of tracks in its wake.

The image, which was caught by a NASA camera orbiting Mars last month and released today by scientists, shows Rover making its way across the planet.

The tracks lead back to a dark, blasted spot on the surface of Mars. The spot called the 'Bradbury Landing' is where Rover first touched down on the planet - and is named after the late sci-fi author Ray Bradbury.

The blue spots are where the rocket engines touched the sand on the red planet as it carefully lowered the 1-ton rover. 

When the picture was taken, the Curiosity Rover was exploring rocks called 'Shaler' before heading on a five-mile journey to Mount Sharp, according to space.com.

NASA scientists are keen to discover what secrets Mount Sharp, which is 3.4miles high, holds in its layers about the changing environment on the planet. 

The main focus of the Curiosity Rover is to work out if Mars has ever supported life.

Snow on ancient Mars is the most likely reason for the network of valleys that exist there, scientists revealed this week.

Recent
findings by researchers at Brown University have shown that some 
Martian valleys appear to have been caused by runoff from orographic 
precipitation -- moisture carried part of the way up a mountain and 
deposited on the slopes.

The findings help to answer the question of whether water flowing on ancient Mars bubbled up from the ground or fell down from the atmosphere.

Scientists studied four different 
locations on Mars that they suspected had water-carved valleys, caused 
by snow or rainfall when moist prevailing winds are pushed upward by mountain ridges.

The
new findings, published in Geophysical Research Letters, are the most 
detailed evidence yet of an orographic effect on ancient Mars and could 
shed new light on the planet's early climate and atmosphere.

Kat Scanlon, a geological sciences graduate student at Brown, led the research and is well-acquainted with the orographic effect.

She did graduate work in meteorology in Hawaii, which is home to a quintessential orographic pattern.

Moist tropical winds from the east are pushed upward when they hit the mountains of Hawaii's big island.

The winds lack the kinetic energy to reach the mountain summit, so they dump their moisture on the eastern side of the island, making parts of it a tropical jungle.

The western side, in contrast, is nearly a desert because it sits in a rain shadow cast by the mountain peak.

Ms Scanlon thought similar orographic patterns might have been at play on early Mars and that the valley networks might be an indicator.

'That's what immediately came to mind in trying to figure out if these valleys on Mars are precipitation related,' she said.

The scientists started by identifying four Martian locations where valley networks were found along tall mountain ridges or raised crater rims.

To establish the direction of the prevailing winds at each location, the researchers used a newly developed general circulation model (GCM) for Mars.

The model simulated air movement based on the gas composition scientists think was present in the early Mars atmosphere.

The team then used a model of orographic precipitation to determine where, given the prevailing winds from the GCM, precipitation would be likely to fall in each of the study areas.

The simulations showed that precipitation would have been heaviest at the heads of the densest valley networks.

Ms Scanlon said: 'Their drainage density varies in the way you would expect from the complex response of precipitation to topography. We were able to confirm that in a pretty solid way.'

The atmospheric parameters used in the GCM are based on other models that predict a cold climate on the red planet, so the precipitation modeled in this study was snow.

However, the researchers said that the snow could have been melted by episodic warming conditions to form the valley networks and therefore it could also have rained on ancient Mars.

Ms Scanlon said: 'The next step is to do some snowmelt modeling.

'The question is how fast can you melt a giant snowbank. Do you need rain? Is it even possible to get enough discharge [to carve the valleys] with just the snowmelt?'

The answers to these questions could provide an insight into the climate on Mars billions of years ago.
