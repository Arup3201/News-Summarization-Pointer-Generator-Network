Former Chelsea midfielder Tiago will leave Spanish champions Atletico Madrid next month and wants a Premier League swansong at Stamford Bridge.

The 33-year-old midfielder was an integral part of Diego Simeone’s side this season but his contract is up and Atletico Madrid feel they already have the next big thing in Spanish football ready to step into his place.

Saul Niguez is an under-19 European Champion with Spain and Atletico already have him tied to the club until 2017. Last year they sent him out on loan at Rayo Vallecano but next season he will return to take his place in the centre of midfield ousting Tiago.

London bound? Tiago is keen on a return to Chelsea, where he spent one season under Jose Mourinho in 2004-05

But the Portuguese midfielder who played for Jose Mourinho in the 2004-05 season could make an emotional return to West London having shown this season he still has plenty to offer.

He was in tears when he left Chelsea for Lyon in 2005 for £6.5million having decided, against his coach’s wishes, to look for more regular first team starts elsewhere.

'Mourinho is someone who knows exactly what to say to his players in any given moment. He makes the decisions. He never consults the players because he is the one who takes responsibility; he is the figurehead and it’s a role he plays better than anyone,' said Tiago about his former coach earlier in the season as he prepared to face his old club in the Champions League semi-finals.

'There are a lot of similarities between him and Simeone. In fact in terms of the winning mentality that comes through every day they are not similar they are identical.

Reunion: Tiago would relish the opportunity to work under Jose Mourinho again

'I had an unforgettable year at Chelsea. My departure was a little bit sad. It was my decision to leave. I felt it was best for me. It was a little bit against what Mourinho and the rest of the team wanted but Gerard Houlier in Lyon wanted me and was ringing me every day telling me to come to Lyon. It was a chance to go somewhere where I would be playing every week.'

If Tiago does make a return to Stamford Bridge it could boost the number of Atletico Madrid players arriving at the club this summer to three with Thibaut Courtois likely to return from his loan spell and Diego Costa also wanted by Mourinho.

Tiago has no doubts what Chelsea will be getting if they can take Courtois as their number one keeper for the next campaign.

He said: 'He’s the best in the world at the moment as far as I’m concerned. He transmits an incredible sense of security to the team. He’s just a kid but you look at him filling the goal and it just puts you at ease.'
