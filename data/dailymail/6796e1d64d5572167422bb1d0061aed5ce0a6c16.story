From a dog's point of view it must be very tempting to play with a plastic ball - especially when that ball contains a small, cute rodent.

But a family pet ensures a tiny hamster is protected from the unwanted attentions of another household dog by nudging him aside every time he goes near.

The pet hamster in his exercise ball is blissfully unaware of the power play going on between two dogs in this sweet video shot in a family's kitchen.

Looks like a good toy! The other family dog looks longingly at the hamster in its exercise ball

And Nina the faithful dog doesn't just protect hamsters if the man filming the encounter is to be believed. 

'She does the same with the rabbit,' the man says of the family's canine rodent protector.

The other dog tries a couple of times to play with the hamster in its ball but eventually gives up as he is pushed out of the way. 

The relationship between dogs and hamsters isn't always quite so harmonious.

Stories of dogs and cats eating beloved furry pets are rife - which means Nina probably deserves a pat on the head and maybe even a treat for being so kind. 

Oh no you don't: Nina steps up her protector role and tackles the over-friendly rodent worrier

Headed off at the pass: Nina blocks the other household dog from going anywhere near the tiny hamster

Don't even think about it: There's no way the hamster is getting any more interference from you, says Nina
