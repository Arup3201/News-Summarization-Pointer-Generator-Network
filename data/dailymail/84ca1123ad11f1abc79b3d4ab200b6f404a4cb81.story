Britain's former tallest man was buried today in a bespoke coffin measuring almost 8ft long and remembered by friends as a 'gentle giant'.

Actor Christopher Greener, from Bromley, south London, who grew to be 7ft 6in and a half inches and weighed up to 30 stone, died last month aged 71.

More than 60 people attended his funeral today including members of the Tall Cub of Great Britain and eight pallbearers were needed to carry him.

His best friend Berry Tolson, who met Mr Greener 50 years ago when they both played for the London Latvian Basketball Klub, said he was so tall he could put the ball into the net with no effort.

Mr Greener, who grew to be 7ft 6in and a half inches and weighed up to 30 stone, died last month, aged 71

'Chris, as my wife would say was a 'gentle giant', he was very funny, caring and kind and our whole family will miss him terribly.

'He struggled towards the end of his life with his health and found it increasingly difficult to get around. 'Mowing the lawn and day-to-day chores were extremely difficult for him being so extremely tall but he was always cheery and never stopped making us laugh.

'He even joked to Irene, my wife, that he expected getting a coffin to fit him could be difficult and that he wouldn't mind if we just got someone to 'break his legs'.

'My wife and I are thankful to Chris for all of the great memories that he has provided us with and we will never forget the gentle giant that we loved dearly.'

The coffin (right) was made specifically for him and at least 10 pallbearers were needed to carry it as he also weighed 30 stone

Mr Greener had to be buried in a double plot of land, which is normally reserved for two people

Mr Greener had to be buried in a double plot of land, which is normally reserved for two people, at his parish church in Hayes, near Bromley, Kent.

He was diagnosed at 27 with a condition known as pituitary gigantism where a tumour had grown on his pituitary gland, an organ that controls bodily functions including release of growth hormones.

Surgeons removed the tumour when he was already in the record books for being UK's tallest man and he would have continued to grow if they had not.

He played basketball internationally for Great Britain in the late 60s and early 70s and played the circus giant in David Lynch's film The Elephant Man.

Mr Greener also starred in The Rainbow Thief and Birdie Blues as well as appearing in several documentaries chronicling the lives of the very tall.

Mr Greener lost his title as Britain's tallest man in 2007. The 71-year-old spent the majority of his life towering over friends and family. He is pictured above at a friend's wedding 

Fellow actor and friend Ross Sambridge, 7ft 1in tall, met Christopher at the Tall Club which he founded.

Ross said 'He was a great guy, a real gent.' 

Matthew Uden Funeral Director from W.Uden and Sons said: 'I had the pleasure to find out about Christopher after I had a long chat with his friends, they described him as a gentle giant who had an enormous heart.

'The funeral went very well with some beautiful things being said about his life and antics, I am sure that he would have been pleased with his send off.

'Mr Greener was an extremely tall chap and we had 8 coffin bearers to carry him in to the church as opposed to the usual 4 or 6.' 

Mr Greener's height afforded him roles in films. Above, he is prepared for an appearance by a make-up artist

Mr Greener was buried at St Mary's Cemetery in Hayes, Bromley, earlier today and his friends described him as a 'gentle giant'

He held the title for 40 years and was replaced in 2007 by Neil Fingleton, who measures 7ft 7.56ins tall.

Mr Fingleton, from Durham, also played basketball and is now an actor, having recently starred alongside Mila Kunis in Jupiter Ascending.

Neither however beat the record of William Bradley, who at 7ft 9ins tall, was known as the Yorkshire Giant until his death in 1820.

Last year Leonid Stadnyk, believed to be the world's tallest man at an estimated 8ft 5in tall, was carried to a graveyard on the back of an open truck because his remains were too large for a hearse.

Throughout his life Mr Stadnyk, from Ukraine, had refused to be measured to determine his height because he said it would be humiliating.

Among the activities Mr Greener was able to take part in was basketball where he shone on the court
