This is the dramatic moment a passerby miraculously catches a one-year-old baby who fell from a second-storey window ledge.

CCTV cameras show the man, known as Mr Li, looking upwards in terror just before the infant drops into view in a street in China.

Despite pouring rain, the hero somehow manages to cling on to the baby just inches before it would have hit the ground.

Mr Li said: 'I didn't think too much at the time. I was just afraid of failing to catch him.

'It was nothing but instinct to do so.'

The child was later placed in the arms of a woman, believed to its mother, who runs off cradling the baby.
