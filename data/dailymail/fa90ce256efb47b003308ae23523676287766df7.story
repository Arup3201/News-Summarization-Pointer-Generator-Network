It's hard for professional golfers to hit a good shot out of a sand trap, let alone out of a lunar crater in zero gravity.

But astronaut Alan Shepard managed to hit his shot for 'miles and miles' when he played golf on the moon in 1971

A rare, framed photo of the moon's surface with lunar rover tracks autographed by Shepard to a golf pro with the inscription 'this trap needs raking' will be auctioned Nov. 21 along with hundreds of other items of space and aviation memorabilia by New Hampshire auction house RR Auction.

Other pieces of memorabilia include a lunar dust-coated checklist worn on one astronaut's trip to the moon and a set of notes handwritten by Neil Armstrong.

The spiral-bound, 20-page checklist was worn by Apollo 15 mission commander David Scott on the outside of his spacesuit, on an aluminum arm brace with Velcro wristband, during the 1971 lunar visit.

Such checklists which give 
step-by-step instructions on activities planned at the landing site are 
considered 'the rarest and most desirable of all flown space 
memorabilia,' Bobby Livingston, a vice president at RR Auction told the Associated Press.

The checklist is expected to fetch roughly $250,000.

'Rarely offered for sale, most cuff checklists reside in museums or in the private collections of the moonwalkers themselves,' Livingston said.

Scott's list is of particular historic note as it was the first mission to use a lunar roving vehicle.

Armstrong's notes, done in pencil 
between the mid-1970s to early 1980s, list various items and include the
words, 'One small step,' in reference to a limited edition silkscreen 
print of his lunar landing by artist Sandra Lawrence.

Precious: This spiral-bound checklist worn during the Apollo 15 mission by commander David Scott is considered an extremely rare bit of memorabilia valued up to $250,000

Armstrong also writes about the U.S. Geological Survey lunar maps, Russian lunar maps, and a lunar cockpit panel drawing.

The notes are expected to draw at least $3,000.

Also included is a photo valued at $5,000 of NASA's original video transmission of Armstrong's first steps on the moon autographed by the astronaut himself.
