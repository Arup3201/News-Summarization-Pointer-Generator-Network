Luis Suarez hasn't been in Barcelona long but admirers from his native Uruguay have wasted no time in welcoming him to Spain.

Fans camped outside the former Liverpool striker's new home in the Catalan city after his £75million move to Luis Enrique's side.

The ex-Anfield hitman was happy to sign shirts and flags from over the fence to his new abode.

Suarez cannot be officially unveiled by his new club under the terms of his four-month ban from all football activity.

FIFA were forced to act after he bit Italy's Giorgio Chiellini in Uruguay's final group game in Brazil.

But despite this Suarez is not short of admirers in the Spanish city, as he adjusts to life in Barcelona before he makes his eagerly awaited debut at the end of October.

The 27-year-old will be hoping his move to the Catalan giants will bring about greater personal success and silverware after suffering late agony in the Premier League title race last season.

Suarez's former employers Liverpool looked set to win the league before being pipped to the title in the final few games by Manchester City, eventually finishing two points behind Manuel Pellegrini's side.

Barcelona will be hoping the addition of Suarez is what they need to get their trophy haul back on track, after they also failed to win a trophy in the 2013/2014 season.
