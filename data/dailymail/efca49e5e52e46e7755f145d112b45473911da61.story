Germany last night warned Britain ‘you won’t be happy alone’ in the world, amid deepening tensions over David Cameron’s threat to veto an increase in the EU’s vast budget.

Chancellor Angela Merkel, who visited Downing Street for talks with the Prime Minister last night, even raised the spectre of the Second World War as she issued a provocative suggestion that the UK would flounder on its own outside the EU.

British officials said that despite Mrs Merkel’s visit to attempt to broker an agreement ahead of a crunch EU budget summit this month, chances of a deal were rapidly receding.

'Alone they would not be happy in this world': Angela Merkel made the comments ahead of dinner with David Cameron at Downing Street tonight

Warm welcome: Mr Cameron greeted the German leader with a kiss on the steps of 10 Downing Street, ahead of a meeting expected to be dominated by the increasingly tense talks on the EU's 2014-2020 budget

Mrs Merkel has set out her vision of a more closely integrated EU core ¿ one likely to antagonise British eurosceptics still further

Mr Cameron yesterday branded a 
proposed EU budget increase ‘completely ludicrous’ and demanded Mrs 
Merkel stick to an earlier agreement to back Britain in pushing for at 
least a freeze.

Senior figures in Brussels are 
increasingly frustrated with the stance of the British Government, 
demanding it either makes a clear commitment to the EU or quit.

But Mrs Merkel’s suggestion that she 
would ‘do everything’ to keep Britain in the EU is likely to be seized 
upon by Mr Cameron as an indication that she is ready to offer 
concessions on budget demands.

‘I want a strong Britain in the EU. 
Britain was there when we were liberated from National Socialism,’ the 
German leader said, in a reference to the end of the Second World War.

‘I cannot imagine Britain not to be 
part of Europe. I think that it is good for it, too, to be part of 
Europe. When you are somewhere alone in a seven billion-strong global 
population, I don’t think it is good for Britain.

‘You can be very happy on an island – but alone they would not be happy in this world.’

Mrs Merkel, speaking in the European 
Parliament in Brussels before travelling to London for dinner with Mr 
Cameron, set out her vision of a more closely integrated EU core – one 
likely to antagonise British eurosceptics still further.

‘I want all countries to become 
members of the euro,’ she said. ‘I’m sure the European Commission will 
become a government one day . . . but we must give people a little more 
time.’

Mr Cameron has expressed outrage that 
the European Commission is seeking an £80billion budget rise for the 
seven-year period from 2014, accusing it of ‘doing nothing’ to tighten 
its belt while member states imposed austerity measures.

The Prime 
Minister last night urged Mrs Merkel to stick to a letter she signed in 
2010 calling for a real-terms freeze in EU spending.

Government sources said different 
sides in the budget row were so far from agreement that a summit due to 
start on November 22 was likely to collapse. That would mean the 27 EU 
leaders reconvening next year to try to hammer out a deal.

If an agreement cannot be reached by 
the end of the year, the existing budget will roll on, plus inflation – 
meaning Britain will be required to pay more.

In a sign of increasing impatience 
with Britain in Brussels, French MEP Joseph Daul, chairman of the main 
centre-Right EPP group in the European Parliament, last night called for
an end to what remains of the UK’s historic budget rebate.

The British Conservatives used to 
belong to the EPP group, along with Mrs Merkel’s CDU party, before Mr 
Cameron pulled them out over their commitment to a federal Europe.

Mr Daul, responding to an attack from 
UKIP leader Nigel Farage, said he would accept an ‘amicable divorce’ of 
Britain and the EU – but he wanted ‘custody of all the children’. Some 
took that as a reference to an independent Scotland.

Mr Farage told Mrs Merkel there was ‘growing anger in Britain’.

‘Why are we pumping £53million a day 
of British taxpayers’ money into this Union? It is Britain’s place in 
this Union that is the real question. And increasingly Britain looks 
like a square peg in a round hole.’

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘You 
have got 27 countries sitting round the table and they all want 
different things from the budget, so it is always going to be difficult 
to get agreement. We are going to be arguing for an outcome that is in 
Britain’s interests.’

At dinner last night, Mr Cameron 
served Mrs Merkel spinach and mushroom tart, followed by venison, and a 
German pudding, Donauwelle – a cake made from cherries, buttercream and 
cocoa. There was also a cheese course, and the two leaders drank red 
wine.

As the two leaders discussed Britain's future in the EU, Greek protests ended in tears as outraged residents protested against the austerity bill the Government were voting on.

Greek police fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters armed with petrol bombs last night during one of the biggest rallies in the country in months.

The clashes came as the country’s parliament voted on a hugely unpopular austerity bill.

More
chaos reigned inside the assembly, where the session was interrupted 
when parliamentary workers went on strike to protest against a clause 
that would have cut their salaries. In a humiliating about-face, the 
government was forced to cancel the measure.

Outside, loud booms rang out as protesters hurled petrol bombs and rocks at police, who responded with tear gas, stun grenades and water cannons – the first time they had been used in an anti-austerity protest. 

Earlier in the evening, protesters braved a downpour, holding flags and banners saying ‘It’s them or us!’ and ‘End this disaster!’ Some held Italian, Portuguese and Spanish flags representing other nations facing austerity measures.

‘These measures are killing us little by little and lawmakers in there don’t give a damn,’ said Maria Aliferopoulou, a 52-year-old mother of two. ‘They are rich, they have everything and we have nothing and are fighting for crumbs, for survival.’

The proposed cuts and tax hikes, expected to be worth £10billion, are required to unlock a loan tranche of more than £20billion from the European Union and International Monetary Fund bailout.
