Saracens back row Billy Vunipola has been called before a Rugby Football Union disciplinary panel after being cited for striking Leicester's Mathew Tait with his head on Saturday.

The incident occurred in Saracens' 22-6 win at Allianz Park, a match in which Vunipola scored a try.

Vunipola's case will be heard by a three-man panel on Tuesday.

'Billy Vunipola (Saracens) will appear before an RFU Disciplinary Panel tomorrow (April 14) after being cited following the Aviva Premiership Round 19 match against Leicester Tigers at Allianz Park,' an RFU statement said.

'The panel of Philip Evans (chair), Bonike Erinle and Martyn Wood will sit at the London Bloomsbury Inn (6.30pm) and review the offence of striking Mathew Tait with the head, contrary to Law 10.4 (a), or, in the alternative, charging into a ruck, contrary to Law 10.4 (h).'

The panel will also consider the case of Leicester centre Vereniki Goneva, cited for striking Saracens' Kelly Brown with his forearm in the same game, but the player has chosen not to attend.
