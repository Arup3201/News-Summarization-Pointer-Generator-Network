When you've exhausted your options on Happn, and swiped left on any potential soulmate on Tinder, where do you turn?

Well, you might want to think about flirting with your opponents on a gaming app. Which is exactly what students Maria Jernslett, 22, and Erlend Finboe Svendsen did. 

The lovebirds met on the word game Ruzzle, where you compete with other users to find the highest score of correct words.

Maria and Erlend met on the word puzzle app Ruzzle, they started dating in 2013 and now plan to marry

Maria and Erlend have enjoyed several holidays today travelling to Spain for a holiday 

The couple first started talking in 2012 when they both pressed the option to play with a 'random player' at the exact same time and were pitted against each other. 

Then after two months of playing the game Erlend decided to drop Maria a message. 

Maria explained: 'I guess you can say we were at the right place at the right time. Initially, Erlend out-performed me consistently, but I was up for a challenge.

'After a couple of months of playing Ruzzle, I finally won and he decided to send me a message saying "take it easy".

The couple, pictured here in Paris, are planning on moving in with one another in London later this year

Maria has revealed the couple's families thing that they are perfect for one another and should get married

Maria and Erlend are both from Norway originally but now live in the UK. While she studies in London, he is doing an MSc in Finance at Durham University.

The message Erlend sent initiated a  conversation between them - chatting about the everything from the game to their personal lives.

Maria said: 'Both of us found comfort in the fact that we could talk openly about things to a complete stranger, and that the other person did not know anything except from the nickname in Ruzzle. 

'We intended to meet each other for a long time, but it we had become addicted to texting, and that we actually started to miss each other even though we constantly chatted.'

Erlend and Maria met on the word game app Ruzzle playing against each other for a couple of months before eventually getting in contact 

Maria said it was easier for her and Erlend to talk to one another about their problems over the app 

'In the summer of 2013, Erlend was invited by a friend from his former university to go for a festival in the southern part of Norway, which is was close to my hometown. 

'So we decided to meet. Without exaggerating, it was love at first sight. We stayed up the entire night and just kept talking. We have been a couple since that day.'

Throughout their relationship they have been separated and lived in different towns. But the couple are already planning to move in with one another in May  and get married.

And they've already enjoyed some pretty special holidays, travelling  to Spain and Paris together.

Maris said: 'Both of our families wanted us to get married right away, as they realised that we were a perfect match.'
