A juror in the trial of the disgraced son of socialite Brooke Astor has recanted her guilty vote and pleaded for him to be spared jail at the last minute.

Judi DeMarco, who was Juror No.8 in the high profile trial of Anthony Marshall, 89, says she went along with a guilty vote that she did not believe in because of 'fear and exhaustion'.

She has now signed an affidavit saying she believes Marshall, who is due to begin a jail term of up to three years on Monday, is innocent of plundering his mother's millions,

A New York state appeals court has upheld the conviction of Anthony Marshall, who was found guilty in 2009 of siphoning off millions of dollars from the estate of his mother, philanthropist and socialite Brooke Astor

Conviction upheld: Anthony Marshall, son of late philanthropist Brooke Astor, sits in Manhattan Supreme Court where opening arguments were delivered in his trial

Astor died in August 2007 aged 105

Marshall had petitioned the Court of Appeals to overturn his 2009 conviction for attempting to con his late philanthropist mother's estate out of $60million, but lost his case last week.

The parties were notified by mail last week and Marshall was told to surrender for execution of sentencing on June 17.

Today juror Ms DeMarco called for Marshall to be spared jail as she said she only voted guilty because she was bullied into it.

In a 10-page affidavit seen by the New York Post, she wrote: 'I changed my vote out of fear and exhaustion, not because I had been persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt of guilt.

'I wished I had stood my ground and not changed my vote to guilty.'

Lawyers are now expected to file a motion today to delay Marshall's surrender to jail, and a further hearing is likely to take place to look into the juror's allegations over the conviction.

Vast wealth: Brooke Astor's Westchester home - most of the furniture was auctioned at Sotheby's last year and the proceeds went to philanthropic causes in New York City

Taken: While the furniture was initially given to Marshall from Brooke Astor's will, he will now not see any of the money after being found guilty of defrauding the elderly woman

Ms DeMarco also cast doubt on the reasoning behing the conviction of Marshall's fellow defendant, lawyer Francis X Morrissey, who was found guilty of helping Marshall con his mother by forging Astor's signature on her 2004 will.

She said that her fellow jurors, whom she accused of using emotion rather than reason in their deliberations, decided the pair were guilty and came up with a theory around the signing of the will to suit that.

Ms DeMarco also claims she was verbally 
attacked by other jurors, whom she accuses of swearing at her and 
threatening her during deliberations.

She says she has come forward on the eve of the defendants' imprisonment because she did not vote according to her conscience.

 'My only purpose in submitting this affidavit is to let the court know the truth'

          - juror Judi DeMarco

She said: 'My only purpose in submitting this affidavit is to let the court know the truth — that defendants did not receive what the judge told us they were entitled to: the fair and honest verdict of 12 jurors regarding the charges against them.'

Marshall has been outcast by New 
York society since he was convicted of conning his philanthropist mother, who died in 2007 aged 105, out of millions.

He and wife Charlene have kept
to a frugal life of solitude in their Upper East Side apartment  during the appeals process and they have rarely seen in public 
as he awaits his one to three year sentence.

A lower court judge wrote in March that he took advantage of Astor 'when they knew her physical and mental condition' were deteriorated.

Marshall also gave himself a $2million pay raise and bought a 55ft long yacht with his mother's money.

The wheelchair-bound son had begged judges to spare him the jail time given his age, health, military service and lack of prior criminal history.

Marshall,who is in poor health following open heart surgery, is estranged from his twin sons.

Setting sail: The Titanic leaving Southampton on her ill-fated maiden voyage on April 10, 1912

John Jacob Astor IV was a millionaire 
and decorated Spanish-American war hero who died in the sinking of the 
Titanic in 1912

John Jacob Astor has become one of the most fabled characters to emerge from the 1,517 passengers who died when the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912.

The 47-year-old American tycoon, who built the Astoria Hotel in New York, was returning from his honeymoon on the doomed vessel with his 19-year-old pregnant wife Madeleine.

When the Titanic struck the iceberg, Astor helped his wife into a lifeboat but remained onboard. He was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top deck.

Half an hour later, the ship slipped beneath the ocean waves. His wife survived.

Astor's was one of the 333 bodies recovered on April 22 by a cable ship. He was identified by the initials sewn into his jacket along with his engraved gold watch.  

Astor's son Vincent inherited the piece and wore it for the rest of his life before passing it on to his son, Anthony.

JJ Astor is buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City. Madeleine gave birth to a son on August 14, 1912 who was named after his father.

They testified that their father and 
stepmother were abusing Astor, withholding medical treatment and leaving
her to lie drenched in her own urine.

Marshall was found guilty of 
defrauding his mother out of money she had inherited from her 
third husband, hotelier and realtor Vincent Astor.

Vincent Astor's father John Jacob Astor IV famously died on the Titanic after it sank on April 15, 1912, and he was the one to go claim 
his father's body in Nova Scotia after the wreck.

Brooke Astor had devoted her life to philanthropy, giving eye-watering sums of 
money to the St Regis Hotel, the New York Public Library and the 
Metropolitan Art Museum.

The multimillionaire, who had 
Alzheimer's, was left to spend her last days in heart-breaking 
conditions - her dogs messing over her Park Avenue apartment while she 
napped in her own urine with no one to help, the Post previously 
reported.

The jury convicted Marshall of 14 counts, including first-degree grand larceny and scheming to defraud.

Marshall
did not appear to have learned a lesson from his conviction. In March, 
Marshall was allegedly hawking a fake gold watch that he claimed 
belonged to his famous relative who died on the Titanic.

He and his current wife Charlene made
a rare public appearance three months ago at a lavish party for a new cruise 
ship called the Titanic II.

At the party, he reportedly showed 
guests a gold watch that reportedly belonged to John Jacob Astor and was
trying to sell it for $1million.

However, the story was claimed to be Marshall's  latest con, as a California collector has said that he
bought the real watch in an auction over a decade ago.
