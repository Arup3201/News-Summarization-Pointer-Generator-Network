A father stabbed his estranged wife to death before killing himself as their daughters slept upstairs after she started a new relationship with a teenage toyboy, an inquest has heard.

David Stringer, 32, killed his 29-year-old wife Hayley with a  kitchen knife while three young girls - aged 11, eight and seven - were asleep at the family home in Walsall, West Midlands.

Mr Stringer then committed suicide by stabbing himself in the chest with the same knife.

The couple's bodies were discovered hours later by Mrs Stringer's new boyfriend, 19-year-old Matthew Read.

The Stringers, who had been together for 11 years and married for 10 years, separated in March this year.

They had two children together and Mrs Stringer had a third daughter from a previous relationship - all three of whom were in the house at the time.  

An inquest heard that Mrs Stringer, a factory worker, had started a relationship with Mr Read around the time that she split from her husband. 

Detective Constable Brindley also told the hearing Mr Stringer had previously made threats to kill Mr Read and commit suicide but these had not been reported to police.

Recording a verdict of unlawful killing for Mrs Stringer and suicide for Mr Stringer, Black Country Coroner Zafar Siddique said it was a 'double tragedy', particularly for the children involved. 

He said: 'Having considered all the various evidence my conclusion in relation to Hayley is that she was unlawfully killed.

Their bodies were found by Matthew Read, Mrs Stringer's 19-year-old boyfriend 

'In respect of David I'm satisfied that he took his own life and therefore he committed suicide.

'This is a double tragedy for both families involved, particularly the children involved, and my heart and sincere condolences go out to both sets of families.'

Sandwell Coroners' Court heard how Mr Stringer returned to the family home where Mrs Stringer lived with their children in the early hours of May 10.

The pair were said to have argued before Mr Stringer repeatedly stabbed his wife, later turning the knife on himself. 

Mr Read returned to the house at 3.50am after finishing a night-shift.

He found the couple in the hall wayand living room. Both were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.

The inquest heard Mr Read was arrested at the scene and initially treated as a suspect until he was later ruled out after officers checked with his workplace. 

Detective Constable John Brindley, from West Midlands Police, told the hearing at Smethwick Council House how they arrested Mr Read because of the circumstances in which the bodies were found. 

He said: 'Enquiries were made with his work and he was captured on CCTV leaving his work. He would then have to ride his bike from Cannock to Walsall.

'The timings for the journey all fit into line. He was eliminated from the inquiry.'

He had previously told the hearing:  'The two persons had been in a relationship for about 11 years, married for about 10 years and had two children in that period aged eight and seven.

'Hayley had a further child aged 11 from a previous relationship. The relationship between Hayley and David came to an end around March 29 this year. We know that Hayley commenced a relationship with another man around that time.

The couple had been married for ten years and had two daughters together. Mrs Stringer, pictured left, had an elder daughter from a previous relationship 

'It would appear that they (Hayley and David) weren't getting on and decided to split. It was just prior to 3.50am on May 10, a call was received to ambulance control from a distressed person, Matthew Read.

'He said that the husband had come back and stabbed Hayley. When asked who he meant, he said David Stringer who was also there and had a knife present in his own body.

'The police attended the scene where they found exactly what Mr Read had said. He (Mr Read) was actually at work and had made arrangements to arrive when he had finished his shift.

'The first officer there noticed the front door open, Mr Read was standing in the hallway. There was blood on the door and a female later identified as Hayley had numerous injuries and appeared deceased on the floor.

'A male later identified as David also appeared deceased within the lounge and hallway in a sitting position against a wall.

Sandwell Coroners' Court heard how Mr Stringer had returned to the family home where Mrs Stringer lived with their children, above, in the early hours of May 10

'Obviously there were children within the premises that were taken to a neighbour. The children were asleep upstairs and were carried asleep from the residence to the neighbours.' 

Speaking about Mr Stringer's previous threats, he added: 'There were certain references to threats being made, threats to kill being made against Mr Read and David threatening to take his own life as well.

'No complaints were made to the police, they weren't notified of this. That only came to light once the examinations of various mobile phones and computers was conducted.

'From all the evidence and statements that have come to light during this investigation, the conclusion is that David attacked his wife using a large knife from a collection which was at his father's house following which he took his own life.'

Mrs Stringer's cause of death was given as multiple stab wounds which caused blood loss, a collapsed lung and an obstruction of her airway.

Her husband, who was discovered in a sitting position against a wall with the knife still in his body, died from a single stab wound to the chest.  

Giving his verdict, the coroner said: 'We heard in evidence that Hayley Stringer and David Stringer were in a long-term relationship, they had a number of children.

'For a number of reasons which isn't clear they decided to end that relationship at the end of March this year. From the evidence Hayley then went on to form a new relationship with a Mr Read.

'On the day of the incident, a call was received from Mr Read that when he arrived home he had seen Hayley and David with significant injuries and stab wounds.

'What has unfolded then was that clearly an argument or altercation had taken place between the two parties whereby David had stabbed Hayley.

'She ultimately died from a number of multiple stab wounds and the cause of death was multiple stab wounds.

'David had received one single stab wound to the chest and the cause of death was a stab wound to the chest.'
