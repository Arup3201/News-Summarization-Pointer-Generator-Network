Her mouth frozen in a rictus grin and her eyes blue and staring, the new waxwork of Spain's eight-year-old Princess Leonor is unusual to say the least.

And the sculptures created of her parents, King Felipe and Queen Letizia, which were unveiled by the Wax Museum in Madrid this week are little better.

While Felipe's is without the salt and pepper beard that he has sported since the summer, Letizia's bears little resemblance to the royal original.

Unrecognisable: The creepy waxwork of Princess Leonor is a world away from the angelic-looking real thing

But the Spanish royals aren't the only ones to find themselves on the receiving end of wax tributes that look little like the real thing.

Prince Harry, who now boasts an updated and considerably more lifelike waxwork at Madame Tussaud's in London, was, until recently, another victim of a royal waxwork disaster.

Not only did the sculpture boast hair that was noticeably lighter than the real Harry's copper hue, the wax figure also looked considerably more like Barbie's boyfriend Ken than the prince.

Other bizarre royal sculptures include the terrifying take on the Duchess of Cornwall that once graced Madame Tussaud's and a bizarre rendering of the Prince of Wales that looked more like a Spitting Image puppet than the royal himself.

Not quite right: The creepy-looking wax Felipe is missing the salt and pepper beard of the real thing

Family: Along with Felipe and co, the museum has made waxworks of King Juan-Carlos and Queen Silvia

Frightening: The Spanish royals aren't the only ones to be afflicted by bad waxworks as this one proves

Much better: The real Camilla is much prettier (and far less frightening) than her wax doppelganger

Is it Prince Harry? Or Ken! A terrible take on Charles (left) and a Prince Harry that looks more like a Ken doll

Much better: The real royals are both better looking and a little more rugged than the waxworks

One royal who has had no such problems with waxwork tributes is the Queen, whose Madam Tussaud's sculpture is updated regularly to ensure it looks as close to the real thing as possible.

The current version was made to coincide with the Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and wears a stunning silver lace dress embroidered with 53,000 Swarovski crystals.

Another set of royals to boast accurate waxworks are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, whose likenesses entered the waxwork museum shortly after their wedding in 2011.

Although the Duchess' smile does look slightly fixed, her long chestnut locks are spot on as is the dress, a copy of the blue Issa number worn to announce her engagement to Prince William.

The current Prince Harry is also a good one, with the royal shown looking handsome in his military fatigues.

Spain's Princess Leonor, whose waxwork is enough to frighten most other girls of her age, will surely be hoping for something similar in future.

Who are they? Princess Diana and the Duchess of York both fell victim to terrible waxworks

Beautiful: Both the late Princess Diana and the Duchess of York are prettier on their waxworks

Big improvement: A new Prince Harry sculpture that looks far more like the real thing was recently unveiled

Good effort: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's 2011 sculptures are reasonably lifelike

No problem: The Queen's waxwork is regularly updated and wears a dress that boasts 53,000 crystals
