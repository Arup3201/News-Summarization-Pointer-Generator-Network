A former student at a controversial special needs school is suing the center after she was given painful electrical shocks in a bid to alter her behaviour.

Jennifer Msumba, who has autism, attended the Judge Rotenberg Center, in Canton, Massachusetts, for seven years, during which time she said she would be tied up and shocked as part of her treatment.  

The centre has said it uses the Graduated Electronic Decelerator (GED) shock treatment as an 'aversion therapy', in a bid to stop students from displaying aggressive or self-harming behaviour.

As part of her treatment, staff members would create a list of behaviors which would result in a shock, such as banging her head or making certain hand movements. 

Ms Msumba however, who left the centre in 2009, has said she felt like she received the painful shocks as punishment for being disabled.

She told CBS News correspondent Anna Werner: 'It's not humane, you don't even feel like a person, you have wires all over your body. I would get five or ten shocks for just doing one thing.'

The school faced a storm of controversy two years ago when a shocking video showing a disabled teenage boy being tied up and given 31 electric shocks over seven hours was shown to a court.

The video shows student Andre McCollins strapped face down and shocked because he would not remove his coat.

Mr McCollins, who has learning difficulties, sued the centre in April 2012 for the treatment he had received ten years earlier. 

According to MyFoxBoston.com, the case was settled before a verdict was given by the jury.

During the hearing his mother Cheryl told the court: 'I never signed up for him to be tortured, terrorised, and abused. I had no idea—no idea—that they tortured the children in the school.

'I couldn't turn Andre's head to the left or to the right. He was just staring straight. I took my hands and went like this (waves hand in front of her face), he didn't blink.'

The centre has now said it no longer uses a restraint board when administering shocks.

Earlier this year, Ms Msumba gave testimony to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration Panel, which had met to discuss the 'safety and effectiveness' of using shocks as a form of treatment.  

Four years ago the UN said the technique used at the school amounted to 'torture', and urged Obama's government to put a stop to it.

In a statement to CBS News, JRC said Msumba 'did very well on the GED; she was receiving treatment for self-abusive behavior such as severe head banging.'

The center goes on to say all other treatment had not worked and she also sent positive emails to the school after leaving five years ago. 

Established in 1971 to help 'fix' children who are disruptive and intent on self-harm, the school is known for their use of such tactics which they believe induces positive changes in behaviour.

At the time of the McCollins case two years ago, MailOnline reported how according to literature provided by the school, children do not feel the electric shocks are anything for students or parents to be concerned about.

'This treatment, which feels like a hard pinch, has been extensively validated in the scientific literature... is extremely effective, and has no significant adverse side effects,' the paperwork said.

Aversion therapy is a controversial form of therapy which is based on the premise that certain types of behaviour can be avoided if those displaying it associate it with an unpleasant feeling.

This form of encouraging 'learnt behaviour', as made famous in the Anthony Burgess novel A Clockwork Orange, has received much criticism over the years.

Questions have been raised over how effective the treatment is over the long-term while others have raised serious ethical concerns.

According to SimplyPsychology, it is unclear why the shocks have certain effects, while the treatment is also believed to be less effective in the outside world away from the therapist.

It is also said to have a high relapse rate.
