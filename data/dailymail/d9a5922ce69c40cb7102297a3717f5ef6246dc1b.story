Many brides find themselves  desperately trying to lose a pound or two just before their big day to make sure they fit into their dress.

Tsia Pullen had a more drastic plan. She was so determined to lose weight for her wedding that she decided to have plastic surgery – and sold her house to pay for it.

Mrs Pullen, who weighed 18 stone at her heaviest, spent £22,000 on a variety of cosmetic operations abroad, including a gastric band which helped her drop seven dress sizes and lose ten stone.

Investment: Tsia Pullen paid £19,000 towards surgery - as well as spending £3,000 - on travel

Tsia was overjoyed to be a beautiful bride.

The money came from her £80,000 
semi-detached house, which she put on the market within weeks of her 
engagement to her then fiance, Alastair.

Seven years on, the couple have finally tied the knot – and Mrs Pullen is convinced it all was worth it.

Last night the 34-year-old said: ‘People thought I was insane, but I knew it was the right thing to do.‘It
 was the first house I’d ever bought, it had a massive garden and I was 
proud of it. But more than anything I wanted to look amazing on my 
wedding day.’

remove the excess skin she was left with after her weight loss (left), 
though the operation left her with bruising (right) but she says it was 
all worth it

Tsia met Alistair through her job as a receptionist for a taxi firm when he called up to book a car in 2003

Tsia said that although Alistair, pictured with her at her heaviest, loved her regardless, she didn't want to be an overweight bride

At her heaviest, 5ft 1in Mrs Pullen weighed 18 stone and wore a dress size 24. ‘I hated myself so much,’ she said.

‘I
 used to end up in tears when I went shopping – nothing fitted, and as 
well as the embarrassment, walking around the shops would leave me 
breathless and in agony as I was so big.’

In 2003 Mrs Pullen, who worked as a receptionist in a taxi  firm, took a
 phone call ‘from a friendly-sounding male voice, who turned out to be 
Alastair’.

‘He’d only 
phoned for a taxi, but he was warm, funny and friendly, and for months 
we swapped messages and chatted on the phone before I plucked up the 
courage to meet him,’ she said.

Tsia says her lack of self confidence about her size before the weight loss (left) made it easy to make the extreme decision to sell her home to fund the cosmetic surgery to give her her dream body (right)

‘I
 was certain he’d be put off by my body but Alastair didn’t bat an 
eyelid. He loved me for me and our relationship quickly blossomed. Three
 years later, in 2006, he proposed.

‘But
 then it hit me – this awful vision of a bulging bride waddling down the
 aisle. I didn’t want Alastair to have to marry me while I looked like 
that. I wanted to be a beautiful bride.’

Mrs
 Pullen didn’t have any savings, but she did own her own home. So she 
made the decision to sell the property, in Bolton, and move in with 
Alastair, who lived in Spalding, Lincolnshire.

Tsia shrunk to a trim size 10 and her breasts shrunk from a size 44GG to a 36FF

The
 house sold for £80,000 and, after clearing the £55,000 mortgage, Mrs 
Pullen was left with £25,000 for her plastic surgery. In April 2006 she 
travelled to a private clinic in Belgium for her first operation, a 
gastric band procedure which cost £8,000.

In two years she shed ten stone, going from a size 24 to a size ten. Her bra size also went down to a 36FF from a 44GG.

After spending £22,000 on surgery, Tsia is finally happy with what she sees in the mirror

In
 2008 she travelled back to the clinic for three further operations. In 
June that year she spent £4,000 on arm and thigh lifts, followed by 
£3,700 for a breast lift and liposuction three months later.

She 
spent another £3,500 on a  further breast uplift in December. The 
procedures alone cost £19,000, but with travel and accommodation the 
total bill was £22,000.

Mrs
 Pullen, who now runs her own business selling customised pram covers, 
said: ‘It was a huge amount to pay for cosmetic surgery, and I know some
 people would think badly of me for it, but it was worth every penny.

‘After
 every painful operation I kept telling myself that the end result would
 be worth it. When I started seeing the results, I could feel my 
confidence soaring. I felt like a brand new person and for the first 
time in my life, I felt sexy.’

The
 final operation on Mrs Pullen’s list was a tummy tuck, scheduled for 
April 2009. But that, and the couple’s wedding plans, had to be put on 
hold when she became pregnant with her son Mylo, now four.

Instead
 she had the operation in October 2009, two months after his birth. Mrs 
Pullen was eligible for the tummy tuck on the NHS, because doctors 
agreed the excess skin she was carrying around her stomach was affecting
 her self-esteem and mental wellbeing.

The couple finally tied the knot on their ten-year anniversary, on May 18 this year.

Mrs
 Pullen said: ‘I had my slim-fit wedding dress ready and waiting and I 
was so excited to put  it on and walk down the aisle. I felt like a 
princess.

‘I really do
 feel like the luckiest bride in the world. I don’t regret selling my 
house to fund my surgery for one minute – it’s easily the best thing I 
ever did.’
