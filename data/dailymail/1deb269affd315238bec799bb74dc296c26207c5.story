Police are hunting for a man who grabbed a bus steering wheel while it was driving along meaning the 12 tonne vehicle almost crashed into a parked car.

The man, believed to be in his 30s, made the desperate grab on the number 40 bus in Coventry, West Midlands, after getting into a row with the driver when he accidentally ripped his ticket.

He asked the driver to print a new one because he was worried it wouldn't be valid, but when the driver told him the ticket didn't need replacing as it was still perfectly acceptable, he lashed out.
