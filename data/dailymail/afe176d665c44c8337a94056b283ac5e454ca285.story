Lord Justice Leveson should have investigated a member of his team who had an affair with a lawyer representing supporters of press regulation, a Tory MP said yesterday.

Rob Wilson said the response of the judge in charge of last year’s media ethics inquiry had been a ‘cause for concern’.

The MP, who wants the Bar Council to carry out a full investigation, said: ‘He has come across as either lacking in nous or staggeringly incurious.’

did not start until after the inquiry

The Daily Mail revealed last week 
that Carine Patry Hoskins, a counsel to the Leveson inquiry, had had an 
affair with David Sherborne, a barrister representing advocates of 
statutory press regulation.

In an article on the Guardian 
website, Mr Wilson said: ‘The Bar Council’s code of conduct and related 
guidance is fairly clear on the matter of affairs between opposing 
lawyers: these should be avoided lest the perception be created of “a 
danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy”.

‘One would have thought, given the 
huge significance and public interest in the Leveson inquiry, not to 
mention the cost to taxpayers, that to maintain the inquiry’s reputation
for professionalism the judge would want something like this cleared up
properly and quickly.

‘It would be rather odd were a major 
public inquiry into breaches of ethical standards fail to apply the same
rigour to itself.’

Mr Wilson, who represents Reading 
East, said he believed Lord Leveson would have taken action had a member
of his team been having an affair with a barrister representing News 
International, the publishers of the News of the World.

‘One would imagine that Lord Justice 
Leveson himself would see the matter investigated and the full facts 
established as a matter of urgency,’ he said.

‘If he didn’t, readers would expect 
the Guardian to be leading the charge in finding out what had happened 
and whether News International had benefited in any way.’

Leveson denied any knowledge of the affair, saying he only found out about the couple's holidaying in the past week
