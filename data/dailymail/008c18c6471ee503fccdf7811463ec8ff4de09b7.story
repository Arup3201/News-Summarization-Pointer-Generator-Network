A jailed cocaine dealer has been ordered to sell his hoard of gold jewellery and Italian designer jackets worth tens of thousands of pounds.

Darren Bowles and his school dinner lady girlfriend, Amanda Miller, both 43, were jailed in 2011 after living the 'life of Riley' off money made from drug dealing.

The couple enjoyed five-star breaks in Las Vegas, had Manchester United and Wigan Athletic season tickets and kitted out their New Moston home with lavish furnishings and expensive electrical goods.

But the good times ended after police raided a safety deposit box in Manchester City Centre and found £134,000 of drug money - with Bowles' fingerprints on.

Bowles was jailed for seven-and-a-half years after admitting possessing cocaine with intent to supply, possessing an offensive weapon, possessing and concealing criminal property and benefit fraud, while Miller got 18 months after admitting possessing criminal property and benefit fraud.

Now, the couple has been ordered to hand over nearly £60,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act, which is designed to strip criminals of their ill-gotten gains.

Manchester Crown Court heard that in order to pay back his £36,536 share of the bill, Bowles must arrange for the sale of an Audi A3, a Volvo, eight gold pocket watches, a gold wristwatch, a ladies' Cartier watch, two gold chains, 15 Stone Island designer jackets and six CP Company designer jackets.

He also forfeits thousands of pounds in cash which has been seized by police.

Miller must turn over £22,542 and must also sell a collection of silver coins and a designer Burberry coat.

When the pair were sent down, Judge Andrew Blake said the public would be 'rightly appalled' at their lavish lifestyle.

The court heard that Bowles - who kept high-purity cocaine in snap-bags in the bedroom - protected his enterprise with a state-of-the-art home CCTV system and a CS gas canister.

He wore Hugo Boss suits and jetted off to Hong Kong, Bali, South Africa, Australia and Thailand.

He also spent £7,000 on private dental care after his teeth were ravaged by years of drug abuse.
