Ashton Kutcher may temporarily be living in London, but the headgear he was wearing on Tuesday showed that the Boston Marathon bombings were top on his mind.

Kutcher, 35, posted an image of himself on Twitter wearing a Boston Red Sox baseball cap in a low-key show of solidarity.

The Two And A Half Men star has been in London with 29-year-old girlfriend Mila Kunis, who is shooting a new science fiction film in the Capital.

Showing support from afar: Ashton Kutcher, who is currently in London, wore a Boston Red Sox baseball cap in a Twitter picture posted on Tuesday

Ashton earlier posted a link on Twitter to social magazine app Flipboard, of which he's an investor, to share its coverage of the Beantown bombings.

The actor, who was the first Twitter user with more than one million followers, joined a long list of Hollywood stars who took to social media site to offer tributes to the victims and families of those injured on Monday in the bombings.

The attack near the finish line of the popular race hit particularly hard for stars Ben Affleck, Mark Wahlberg and Edward Norton, who were all born in Boston.

'Tragic day': Ben Affleck, pictured earlier this month, said that his family, including wife Jennifer Garner and daughter Seraphina - shown on Tuesday in Los Angeles - send their love to 'our beloved and resilient Boston'

'Such a senseless and tragic day': Ben took to Twitter to express his horror

Ben, who grew up in Cambridge, Greater Boston, wrote on his Twitter feed: 'Such a senseless and tragic day. My family and I send our love to our beloved and resilient Boston.'

Meanwhile,
Mark looked sombre on Monday as he attended a screening of his latest movie Pain 
& Gain in New York, with it clear his thoughts were elsewhere.

He
told reporters: 'I really didn't even want to come tonight. I hadn't 
really heard much - I spoke to my mom, and most of my family seems to be
OK.

'It's such a big event, there's so many people there. It's horrible 
man. It's disgusting, man. I just - I'm very upset.

Showing his support: Ashton carried his rucksack and held his head low so the cap was on full show as he walked down some steps

Narrow escape: New Kids On The Block singer Joey McIntrye, pictured at the start of the Boston Marathon, missed the blast by five minutes

Fortunate: Joey admitted he was lost for words after the horrific attack

'You try to put everything in God's 
hands and whatever happens here is out of our control and there's a 
bigger picture. But it's still obviously upsetting.'

He also took to Twitter to write: 'Thoughts and prayers with my hometown Boston today.'

Meanwhile,
his older brother Donnie Wahlberg had a fright when he briefly couldn't
get in contact with his New Kids On The Block bandmate Joey McIntyre, 
who was running in the marathon.

In fact, Joey managed to miss the blast by crossing the finish line just five minutes before the first explosion.

The singer, who was running for an Alzheimer's charity, tweeted: 'There was an explosion by the finish line about 5 minutes after I finished - I'm ok but I'm sure there are many hurt.

Pushing the cause: Edward Norton encouraged fans to give to the various charitable causes that so many of the marathon runners were motivated by

Horrified: Zachary Quinto, who lived in Boston during a stint in theatre, spoke out about the bombings at CinemaCon in Las Vegas

Fellow Massachusetts native Edward Norton added his thoughts on Twitter on Tuesday, encouraging fans to donate to the charitable causes that so many runners were dedicated to.

'Crushed about Boston. So senseless. Lots of the runners were running for charity. A nice way to support them now,' he said, including a link to a donation page.

Brazilian
supermodel Gisele Bundchen, who spends a lot of the year in Boston as 
her American footballer husband Tom Brady plays for the New England 
Patriots, tweeted: 'My thoughts and prayers to everyone in Boston 
#prayforboston.'

Twitter was not the only outlet for stunned stars, as the actors from Star Trek were struggling with the 
news as they attended CinemaCon in Las Vegas to promote their upcoming film.

For Zachary Quinto, who plays Spock 
in the movie, the Boston bombings struck close to home as he recently 
completed a theatrical production of The Glass Menagerie there.

He said: 'I mean, I just lived in Boston the 
last three months. I was horrified. It's just 
unfathomable. It's an amazing city and I know it's stronger than one 
tragedy like this. But it is certainly enough to set everybody back in 
an unfortunate and profound way.'

Some had closer connections to the 
tragedy than others, like Star Trek writer Damon Lindelof whose relative
took part in the marathon.

Lindelof said: 'We were all on the way out here just
talking (about how) it is hard to go and pimp your movie on a day like 
this, when the nation is sort of coming together.

'My cousin ran the Boston Marathon today. He finished half an hour before the explosions went off.

'So, I'm just relieved that he's OK. 
And I'm praying, and my thoughts are with the families of people that 
were injured or hurt in any way by this horrible thing.'

Chris Pine, who plays Captain Kirk, 
connected it to the film's plot where the villain threatens Earth and 
the crew of the Enterprise.

'Terrorism is a huge part of our lives, and we all know the effects of that,' Pine said.

Meanwhile, a host of celebrities took to Twitter to express their sympathies for the victims.

Praying for Boston: Celebrities including Justin Timberlake, Oprah Winfrey and Arnold Schwarzenegger took to Twitter

Singer Pink was one of the first to Tweet: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the explosions in Boston.'

Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger soon followed: 'My thoughts are with Boston. Thank you to the brave first responders who always run toward our greatest fears to save lives.'

Justin Timberlake lamented: 'My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the city of Boston and all of those affected by this terrible incident.'

Oprah
Winfrey quoted US President Barack Obama as he tried to reassure the 
nation: '"All Americans stand with the people of Boston" indeed we do 
Mr. President.'
