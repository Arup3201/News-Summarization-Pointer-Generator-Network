Under plans drawn up by Labour smoking would be banned in cars carrying children. 

The Department of Health has always preferred to use education campaigns to stop parents from smoking in private places. 

But Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, believes the ban must be introduced to 'protect children from preventable harm'.

Under plans drawn up by Labour smoking would be banned in cars carrying children

Labour has tabled an amendment to the Children's and Families Bill that would make it an offence for a driver to fail to stop smoking in any vehicle when a child is on board, even if the windows are open.

The move is due to be put to a vote in the House of Lords on Wednesday.

Research has shown that the toxic fumes passengers breathe in are up to 11 times more concentrated than those in a pub full of smoke. 

Labour introduced the smoking ban in pubs in 2007.

According to The Sunday Times, Burnham said: 'Adults are free to make their own choices but that often does not apply to children and that's why society has an obligation to protect them from preventable harm.

'There is legislation banning the use of mobile phones when driving and requiring the wearing of seatbelts.'

A YouGov poll in 2011 found that 78% of adults agreed that smoking should be banned in cars carrying children under 18, while 44% said smoking should be banned in all cars.

It is already against the law to smoke in vehicles used for work, such as pool cars or lorries.

If adults are caught buying cigarettes for children they could face a £50 fixed penalty notice or a fine of up to £2,500. 

According to a Department of Health survey in 2012, more than one in five smokers lit up in front of their children in the home or in the car. 

It is against the law to smoke in vehicles solely used for work, such as pool cars or lorries.

Labour has tabled an amendment to the Children's and Families Bill that would make it an offence for a driver to fail to prevent smoking in any vehicle when a child is on board, even if the windows are open.

If its attempt to change the law fails it will pledge to impose a ban if it wins next year's general election.
