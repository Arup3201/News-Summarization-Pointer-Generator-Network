Discrimination: Stanley Wilson, producer at CNN, alleges that the company failed to promote African Americans outside of its Atlanta and New York offices

A veteran field producer at CNN is suing his former company for $5million over claims age and racial discrimination after going 17 years with only one promotion.

Stanley Wilson, who is now 51, was fired from his job as producer at the Los Angeles bureau, where he had worked since 1996.

The wrongful termination and discrimination lawsuit filed by Wilson claims that Pete Janos, who became bureau chief in 2004, 'never wanted him at the bureau' because of Wilson's 'race, color and ancestry.'

Janos, the lawsuit alleges, 'ruled the Los Angeles bureau through fear and intimidation.'

At the time of his termination, the lawsuit claims Wilson was the sole African-American producer at CNN in the western region, and Wilson often noted to CNN that African-American men outside of New York and Atlanta failed to be promoted. 

Wilson had contributed significantly to the network throughout his time at CNN, producing stories on the Los Angeles cop killer manhunt and the effect of Hurricane Katrina.

He also contributed to the Soledad O'Brien documentary series Black in America and produced Homicide in Hollenbeck, which investigated Los Angeles street gangs and which the lawsuit says was one of the top rated documentaries in CNN history.

A 2001 performance review praised Wilson praised his work reporting on a corruption scandal in the Los Angeles Police Department and the lawsuit says Wilson received numerous awards for reporting.

In 2003 Wilson was promoted, but with the arrival of Janos in the bureau chief position, Wilson's growth at CNN stopped. He would not receive a promotion for the next 10 years in spite of repeatedly applying.

In addition to age and racial discrimination, the lawsuit claims the company discriminated against Wilson because it was worried about the cost of his wife's medical complications.

In 2013, Wilson's wife became pregnant that became 'high risk' and Wilson took a five-week paternity leave to help care for her, telling Janos and CNN's HR manager he and his wife planned for more children if conditions allowed.

When Wilson returned, he found that Janos had replaced a senior producer with a white employee younger than Wilson who the lawsuit alleges had less experience.

The new producer worked on field assignments for Anderson Cooper 360 and prime-time documentaries while Wilson performed in-house packaging and fill-in work at the assignment desk.

By 2014, the lawsuit alleges the network had phased out any need for Wilson. 

When a copy editor noticed a story with three lines of copy needing attribution, Janos spiked the story and initiated an audit of Wilson's work at CNN. Wilson was fired soon after without mention of the audit's findings.

The lawsuit notes that  Fareed Zakaria was only suspended by the company in spite of significant accusations of plagiarism surfaced in 2009. 

It notes that Wilson was not given the two week's pay package normally offered to employees leaving the company and that Wilson has not been successful finding work after his termination.
