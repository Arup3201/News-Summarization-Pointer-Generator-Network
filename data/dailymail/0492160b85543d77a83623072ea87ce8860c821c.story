GP receptionists are being sent on customer care courses to stop them being rude to patients.

The sessions are being trialled in 90 surgeries following a surge in complaints from the public that they were being ‘patronised’ and ‘spoken to like idiots’.

All 802 receptionists and administration staff are being sent on the three-hour courses which teach them how to ‘understand anger’ and be respectful.

The courses are being rolled out in two health trusts – Bradford City Clinical Commissioning Group and Bradford District Clinical Commissioning Group – which serve about half a million patients. Managers said they had decided to fund the £33,000 cost of the trial after listening carefully to ‘frustrated patients’.

One patient, at the Horton Bank Practice in Bradford, said: ‘Receptionists are often rude and patronising.’ Writing on the NHS Choices website, the patient added: ‘I am often being spoken to like an idiot.’

Another, a patient at the city’s Manningham Medical Practice, said: ‘Most of the receptionists are unpleasant to talk to and not very helpful.’ A patient at the Lister Surgery claimed that staff were ‘unfriendly, lazy and rude’ and could rarely answer questions.

A report in 2012 blamed a sudden surge in complaints by patients on unhelpful and surly receptionists.

The Health and Social Care Information Centre highlighted how there were 9,924 grievances about ‘general practice administration’ – a rise of a quarter in just 12 months.

The customer care scheme – unearthed by GP magazine Pulse – is believed to be the first of its kind, but if deemed a success other areas could follow suit. Sessions began in November and will last until April, and are taught by private consultancy firm Striding Edge.

NHS managers said that so far there had been an ‘enthusiastic response’ from those receptionists who had been on the courses.

Dr Andy Withers, clinical chairman of Bradford Districts CCG, said: ‘Listening to patients and GPs about the shared concerns and challenges experienced in general practice will lead to better access and use of services. Improving patients’ access to primary care services is a priority for us, and that’s why we’ve set up this training.

‘GP receptionists are often the first point of contact for a patient, so it’s vital they make a positive impression. We’ve had a really good response from local practices to the offer of training and I’m confident that this will further improve customer service and communication skills.’

Sharon Barraclough, business development manager at The Grange Practice in Bradford who helped set up the scheme, said: ‘The benefit of good customer service cannot be underestimated, and for many receptionists the favourite part of their job is the interaction they have with patients – however, it’s not always the easiest part.

‘Training is vital to what we do “on the front line” and this course recognises the important role every member of the practice team plays in making sure all patients receive the best quality of care possible.’
