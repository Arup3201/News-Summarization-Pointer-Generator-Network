A former investment banker is suing a hotel chain after she claimed they gave a key to a drunk man who then entered her locked bedroom and sexually assaulted her.

Alison Fournier, 31, filed a lawsuit against the Hotel Kamp in Helsinki after an employee at the front desk allegedly gave the key to a stranger who claimed to be the businesswoman's husband.

Miss Fournier said the man entered her room, took his clothes off, climbed into bed and began groping her. She grabbed a bathrobe and fled from the room following the attack on January 15 last year.Â

She said that she was terrified of being raped in the 4am assault. The man, who has not been identified, has not faced criminal charges.

Miss Fournier had been travelling alone for business and no one else was registered to her room.

The banker said she had often stayed at Starwood hotels and expected 'a certain level of security' there.

She said: 'To this day, I still suffer from the memories of that night, and I am not able to put it behind me.

'I don't want this to happen again to any woman traveling for her career.'

Miss Fournier said the stress of the attack has caused her to quit her job and leave New York City to return to Florida to be nearer her family.

The suit was filed against the Starwood 
hotel chain at a Manhattan Federal Court on Monday and seeks unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages.

The businesswoman, who chose to identify herself publicly, attended a news conference with her lawyer Gloria Allred.

Ms Allred said the hotel clerk gave Miss Fournier's key to the drunken fellow guest without checking his identification.

Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide 
Inc, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut, and has 1,071 properties 
worldwide, said in a statement: 'We are taking this allegation seriously
and are working with the hotel in question to understand the facts and 
any breach of security that may have contributed to this very 
unfortunate event.'

In November, attorney Ms Allred also represented a Chicago woman who accused former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain of forcing himself on her. Cain denied the allegations made by the woman.
