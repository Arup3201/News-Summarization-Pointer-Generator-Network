Cricketer Moeen Ali has been told to stop wearing his 'Save Gaza' and 'Free Palestine' wristbands while playing for England by the International Cricket Council.

The 27-year-old all-rounder from Birmingham walked onto the pitch in Southampton today apparently free from the plastic bands he wore yesterday declaring his support for the population of Gaza. 

England were prepared to let Ali continue wearing the wristbands during the remainder of the third Investec Test against India, but the ICC has ruled that its international sports arena was not the place for the British Muslim's show of solidarity.

He has not been charged or punished, but simply told the wristbands must go when he is out on the field. 

Empty wrists: Ali, seen on the pitch today, was not wearing the pro-Gaza bands after the ICC told him not to

Yesterday and today: The 27-year-old's wristbands were obvious yesterday, but he removed them today, right

Got to go: The International Cricket Council ruled that Ali must not wear 'Free Palestine' and 'Save Gaza' bands

Statement: Moeen Ali batted for England against India yesterday in political wristbands that read 'Save Gaza'

 A spokesman for the world governing body said: 'The ICC equipment and clothing regulations do not permit the display of messages that relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes during an international match.

'Moeen Ali was told by the match referee that, while he is free to express his views on such causes away from the cricket field, he is not permitted to wear the wristbands on the field of play and warned not to wear the bands again during an international match.'

The England and Wales Cricket Board was unaware beforehand of Moeen's plans to wear the wristbands but was not planning unilaterally to ask him to take them off until the ICC made it clear he must.  

The body’s code reads: ‘Players and team officials shall not be permitted to wear, display or otherwise convey messages through arm bands or other items affixed to clothing or equipment unless approved in advance by the player or team official’s Board.'Approval shall not be granted for messages which relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes.’

The English Cricket Board (ECB) said that Ali did not ask for permission to wear the wristbands. 

Ali, a practising Muslim of Pakistani descent, wore the black-and-white bands on his wrist yesterday as he batted for England at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton.

Not his day: Ali scored 12 runs towards England's first innings total at the Ageas Bowl yesterday

He was pictured this week raising funds for the victims of the conflict in Gaza with the Ummah Welfare Trust in Small Heath, Birmingham.

According to the United Nations, almost 1,100 people, including many civilians, have been killed during the fighting, with Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon saying on Monday that the territory was in a 'critical condition.'

A UN statement released over the weekend designed to encourage a lasting cease fire between Israel and Hamas, expressed 'grave concern regarding the deterioration in the situation as a result of the crisis related to Gaza and the loss of civilian lives and casualties.' 

Meanwhile, bands showing support for the wounded soldiers charity Help for Heroes are allowed because it is a charity and not a political, racial or religious cause.
