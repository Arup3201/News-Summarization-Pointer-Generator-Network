Reading boss Steve Clarke has revealed he did not watch the FA Cup semi-final draw as he refuses to look beyond Monday's sixth-round replay against Bradford.

The Royals will welcome Phil Parkinson's side to the Madejski Stadium on Monday night, with the winner progressing into the final four to face cup-holders Arsenal at Wembley.

A goalless draw at Valley Parade in the original tie means the draw was made following Arsenal's win at Manchester United but before a replay could decide who would face the Gunners.

Reading manager Steve Clarke reveals he did not watch the FA Cup semi-final draw

Reading and Bradford played out a goalless draw in the FA Cup quarter-final last weekend 

And Clarke, who made nine changes to his side that lost 4-1 at Watford in their Sky Bet Championship clash on Saturday, insists he cannot entertain the idea of a Wembley date as he pays full respect to Bradford.

'I didn't watch the draw,' he said. 'A friend texted me telling me we had drawn Arsenal, but I never intended on watching it.

'I don't think it (the draw) makes any difference whatsoever. I think the game against Bradford is big enough in its own right and the reward of getting through to an FA Cup semi-final is big enough in its own right. So I don't think the semi-final opposition makes a difference to either team.

'Before there is any talk of semi-finals you have to get through to the quarter-final and that's what we intend to do.

'What's the point of thinking about a game that is not there? You have to think about the game coming up and it's a very difficult game for us against a very good Bradford team.'

Despite a potential meeting with Arsene Wenger's FA Cup winners, Clarke believes his squad must be targeting their own success in this season's competition rather than just hoping for a Wembley day out against Arsenal.

'To get to Wembley doesn't excite me, to get to the FA Cup semi-final does,' he said.

That's the key for me. One more step in the cup would be nice. To get to Wembley is just another game, there are no prizes for it.

'The final goal of any competition is to pick up the silver trophy at the end of it. This is just another step on the way to the final. That's how you have to look at every round and that's how we have looked at every round.

'It's not to get excited about a semi-final. In a semi-final there is no trophy, there are no medals. It's much better to put down on your CV that you have got a cup winners medal or you've lifted a trophy.

'That has to be the ambition. The ambition cannot be to reach the semi-final at Wembley, it has to be to lift the trophy.

'That is the mindset I have to give them. That's the mindset you have to have. If you're satisfied to reach a semi-final then that's not correct.'
