From presidents to pop stars, from the young to the old, mobile phone self portraits or 'selfies' are familiar to everyone.

However, while posing for selfies with pouting lips and fluttering eyelashes  might be part of every day life for some, a new device aims to take the fashion for self portraits to the next level.

The Svakom Gaga Selfie Camera Vibrator, or 'sex selfie stick' as it is known, is offering women the chance to take the ultimate picture - of their vaginas during an orgasm.

Online retailer Lovehoney, which is selling the £120 device, says it is the world's first camera vibrator.

The firm says not only will the sex selfie stick enable women to see the action for themselves, there is also the opportunity to share the image with their partners via FaceTime.

Lovehoney likens the popularity of the device to the new craze for selfie sticks which enable mobile phone users to take self portraits from beyond the normal range of the arm.

The firm says the vibrator has an HD camera on its tip and all recordings can be uploaded straight on to a PC or smart phone.

 A spokesman for Lovehoney said the device was proving popular.

 'This is the X-rated selfie stick,' she said. 'Ever wondered what happens inside the body during climax? Now you can find out!

'It allows users to get to know their body in its entirety thanks to the remarkably clear footage this camera captures.

'And thanks to its FaceTime compatibility, sharing the view with your lover couldn't be easier - whether you're sat right next to each other or miles apart.'
