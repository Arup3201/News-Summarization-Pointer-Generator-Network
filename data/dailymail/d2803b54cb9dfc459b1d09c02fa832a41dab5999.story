A Japanese artist who makes objects such as phone cases, kayaks and picture frames shaped like her own vagina has been charged with distributing 'obscene' data.

The charges follow Megumi Igarashi's arrest this month after she raised funds online to pay for a genital-shaped kayak which she made on a 3D printer. 

The 42-year-old was first arrested in July, but was freed after several days following a legal appeal and after thousands of people signed a petition demanding her release.

Igarashi (pictured) is facing up to two years in jail or a fine of 2.5million yen (£13,000) if found to guilty of breaching Japan's strict obscenity laws

But Tokyo police arrested her again this month -- along with sex shop owner Minori Watanabe, 44, also a writer and feminist activist, for 'displaying (Igarashi's) obscene goods in her shop window'.

Ms Watanabe, whose boutique is aimed at women, was later freed after prosecutors failed to persuade a judge to sanction extended questioning. 

Takeshi Sumi, Ms Igarashi's lawyer, said: 'We don't agree with the prosecutors' contention at all.

'We will continue pleading not guilty on behalf of Igarashi, who argues her works are not anything obscene.'

The Japanese court approved her detention, as prosecutors said they feared she would destroy evidence if released, according to Sumi.

The present charges relate to three counts of distributing 'obscene' data -- namely CD-ROMs containing computer code for a 3D printer that would allow users to make copies of the vagina-shaped kayak.

Japan's multi-billion-dollar pornography industry is large and varied, but obscenity laws still ban pictures of actual genitalia, which normally appear pixellated or behind black spots.

If convicted of distributing or possessing obscene materials for the purpose of selling, she could face up to two years in jail and/or a fine of as much as 2.5million yen (£13,000).
