In football terms, ITV Sport has been on a bit of a losing streak with their coverage of the game. 

With the next year or so promising a rather pale mix of highlights shows and live England games, it's certainly not the end of the world. But presumably as a result, it was recently announced that two of their most worthy assistants Matt Smith and Andy Townsend would, in the language of these things, be 'parting company' with the channel at the end of the season.

Now it has been announced that the gaffer has also gone. After nearly five years at the helm, we have been told that Adrian Chiles has now left 'with immediate effect'. Mark Pougatch has been quickly drafted in, certainly at least temporarily, to front their changing football coverage. Were ITV thinking that, perhaps, the Puckish Brummie may not go quite so gently into that good night?

Not that you're going to be asking your waiter 'didn't you used to be Adrian Chiles?' any time soon. Since launching his career working in the business news department at the BBC, he has been, and still remains, a broadcasting heavy hitter. Even from those early days in that rather austere corner of telly, he was being seen as the kind of personality who could bring an 'everyman' touch to his work. And, laudably, he was doing so with an accent and appearance that wasn't straight off the Corporation’s production line.

So when they decided that their new Sunday night version of Match of the Day would need to have a fresh approach to that of the Saturday night flagship, they no doubt also knew they had just the man in the ranks to bring that approach. Chiles had been there, bought the West Brom season ticket.

And so it was that MOTD 2 launched in 2004 with a man at the helm with no parting in his hair and an excitable, scattergun, sometimes frenzied editorial approach that was more like the caller on 606 than it was the cool, controlled anchor. What's more, he also liked to find funny little crowd shots or cock ups and hit us with a one liner over them. Just the kind of thing we do ourselves at home or down the pub.

Chiles came to prominence as the presenter of BBC's Match of the Day 2 show that was launched in 2004

During his time on the BBC, Chiles also presented 'The One Show' which was first aired in 2007

In other words, Chiles was never going to be another Des Lynam. Not least because there will never be another Des Lynam. But also because Chiles was his own man, a natural who also happened to have well-honed presenting skills. What you see is what you get. It was something that quickly then saw him also moving into prime time with the One Show.

Then ITV came along. The big-money deal was made in 2010, which meant Adrian was now moving from his quirky late night magazine football show into hours and hours of live broadcasting (including, albeit briefly, a new breakfast show) under the glaring spotlight of our most successful commercial station.

And this is where the mood began to change. It was a bit like watching an excellent magician, who wowed you up-close with tricks at the dinner table, trying to become David Copperfield on the Las Vegas stage - but using the same old pack of cards with which to do so. The settings were now Champions League venues, European Championships and World Cups. Big Football.

Thankfully, what Chiles didn't try to do was change his personality to fit. That would have made him look like a fake, which I don't see him as. But he didn't adjust his approach. This became particularly clear with his frequent launching of custard pies in the direction of, in particular, Martin O'Neil and Roy Keane. These would often come back with interest. Chiles was determined to maintain the sense that we were all just a bunch of pals watching the footy down the pub together. But it increasingly didn't seem to sit well.

Even his determination to keep his little zingers over funny pictures going from the MOTD 2 days began to feel forced, that he was trying too hard, being offbeat for offbeat's sake.

And yet there was still something left in the tank for last summer. From their fold-up chairs on the beach, and with their collection of knobbly knees on full display, I thought ITV's coverage of Rio 2014 really hit the right note. And Adrian himself was just one knotted handkerchief on the head away from being that fella who had first left his seat at The Hawthorns 10 years ago to make a bunch of old pros look at football through the fans' eyes.

It turns out that this would probably have been the ideal way for Adrian Chiles to close that particular chapter of his broadcasting story.
