The suburban Chicago officer who fired five beanbag rounds that killed an uncooperative 95-year-old man at an assisted living center used 'unreasonable and unnecessary' force, according to an expert on police tactics.

Testifying on Wednesday, Francis R Murphy, a former police officer and Secret Service agent, said the death of John Wrana, a World War II veteran, followed an officer-created crisis.

Park Forest Officer Craig Taylor is on trial for felony reckless conduct for firing five less-lethal beanbag rounds at Wrana as he allegedly brandished a kitchen knife at officers in his apartment.

'There was no threat until Officer Craig Taylor and the others confronted' Wrana, said Murphy.

A ballistic shield being carried by one of the officers would have been sufficient to protect the officers from a knife, though family and staff say they never saw a knife at Wrana's home.  

'Police officers had more than the ability using their shield not only to enter but to knock Wrana down,' he said. 

Taylor's defense attorney Terry Ekl later stated the five beanbag rounds fired did not have to be fatal, but Wrana did not agree to be treated.

'He went to the hospital. He would have lived, survived, if he agreed to surgery,' Ekl said of a man who reportedly refused treatment earlier in the day. 'He refused to get it and said, "I want to die."'

The trial begins at a time of heightened scrutiny of the use of deadly force by police. Taylor, 43, faces up to three years if convicted. 

The incident occurred around 8:45 p.m. in July, 2013, when two officers responded to the center where Wrana lived after staff reported he had struck an EMT, according to a bond hearing document.

Wrana was behaving in 'combative' manner, by threatening staff, as he was reportedly scheduled to undergo a risky surgery, and was apparently afraid to end up on life support.

After entering Wrana's apartment, the officers saw him behind a chair brandishing what was thought to be a machete or knife, which was later identified as a shoe horn, the document states.

The officers left the apartment and closed the door, calling in a corporal along with Taylor and Commander Michael Baugh, who brought a riot shield and 12-gauge beanbag shotgun, the Chicago Tribune reported. 

The group attempted to communicate with Wrana through the door, but the man told them 'Don't come in or I'll throw the knife at you,' according to the bond hearing document.

The officers then entered the apartment behind Baugh's ballistic shield as he attempted to subdue Wrana, who was now wielding a knife, by firing a Taser, the document states.

Taylor ordered Wrana to drop the knife and then fired five beanbag rounds at him from a distance of six to eight feet, causing Wrana to drop the knife and a cane he was holding. 

The Chicago Tribune reported that Wrana was conscious when he was taken to St. James Hospital and Health Centers in Chicago Heights.

But he was then moved to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he died at about 2.30 a.m.

The Southtown Star reported that an autopsy found the war veteran died from being shot in the stomach with bean-bag ammo.

The incident was ruled as a homicide by the medical examiner, The Blaze reported.

According to the Wrana family lawyer, Nicholas Grapsas, the 95-year-old was honorably discharged from the U.S. Air Corps in the rank of a sergeant after fighting in India and Burma. During his service in the Pacific, he was shot down once.

‘The Japanese military couldn’t get him at the age he was touchable, in a uniform in the war,’ Grapsas told the Tribune. ‘It took 70 years later for the Park Forest police to do the job.’ 

After the war, the Massachusetts native moved to California and got into real estate before settling in Glenwood, Illinois.

His wife of more than 30 years, Helen, passed away in 2005. The veteran lived with his 74-year-old stepdaughter, Sharon Mangerson, until his health took a turn for the worse.

Grapsas and Wrana’s stepdaughter have questioned the official version of events laid out by police, insisting that the elderly man was sitting in his chair the entire time, and neither his family nor staff ever saw a butcher knife in his room.

According to the Chicago Tribune, Wrana was scheduled to undergo an operation. On the night of the tragic incident, his doctor told Margenson over the phone that even if he survives the surgery, her stepfather will likely end up on life support.

Wrana than got on the phone with Sharon, thanked her for everything she has done for him and told her he loved her before saying goodbye and hanging up. That was the last she's heard of him.
