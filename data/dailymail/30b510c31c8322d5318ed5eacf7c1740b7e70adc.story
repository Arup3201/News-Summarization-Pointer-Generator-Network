Internet trolls have hacked a Facebook page set up for murdered schoolgirl April Jones posting pornographic images and 'undignified' messages on to it.

Police have been called in to investigate the 'disgusting content' which appeared on the site created by April's family and friends.

The Facebook page appealed for help after April, five, disappeared from the street where she was playing outside her home in Machynlleth, Powys.

A screen grab of the Find April Jones Facebook page - which was hacked by internet trolls who posted 'barbaric' images and pornographic images on the page

The Find April Jones page, which is 'liked' by more than 207,000 people, was taken down by Facebook today after 'barbaric and undignified' messages appeared overnight.

One of the trolls had posted the message 'No money no honey' on the site's appeal for information section.

April's parents Paul and Coral Jones were said to be 'outraged and extremely upset' by the disgusting images posted alongside pictures of their murdered little girl.

The couple's MP Glyn Davies said: 'I am completely shocked and sickened by this. It's hard to believe that people can stoop so low.

'April's family have been through enough and how anyone can be sick enough to increase their pain is beyond me. I am appalled.'

'No Money no Honey' was also written on the The Facebook page by the trolls. The schoolgirl's parents Paul and Coral were said to be 'outraged' by the hacker's actions

Horrified users posted on the page, with some saying the hackers 'should be ashamed' of themselves.

One said: 'Your new content is very inadequate and immature and really has no connection to the poor little April Jones.

'You should be ashamed of yourself for even portraying such barbaric and undignified posts on a page that represents just how bad people can be. You should be disgusted.'

Another said: 'Such a shame that someone has sullied the memory of April.'

Another said: 'Iâ€™m sorry but Iâ€™m going to have to leave this page due to the content having nothing to do with poor little April Jones. Disgusting!'

The page was set up following the disappearance of April Jones, five, in October 2012

Mark Bridger is serving a whole life sentence for April's kidnap and murder

April's disappearance in October 2012 sparked the biggest missing persons search in British legal history.

Some of her remains were found in a cottage at Ceinws, Machynlleth, the home of Mark Bridger, 48, who is serving a full life sentence for her kidnap and murder.

County councillor Michael Williams, who lives close to the Jones family, said: 'When Facebook is used for the right reasons - such as setting up a search party when April first went missing - it can be superb.

'But when it's used for the wrong reasons the impact can be devastating.

'This must be very distressing indeed for April's family.'

Earlier this week, the mother of James Bulger was abused on Twitter by someone posing as Jon Venables - her child's killer.

Merseyside police said they were investigating after an account was set up to send vile messages to Denise Fergus about her toddler's brutal murder in 1993.

The troll, using the name @SirJVenables wrote messages about harbouring a desire to kill more children.

The offensive account also posted CCTV images of James Bulger being led to his death byVenables and friend Robert Thompson. The pair were were jailed for eight years for sadistically killing the two-year-old when they were 10.

It since been suspended by Twitter after an online campaign.
