Reality TV mom Kate Gosselin has filed a lawsuit accusing her ex-husband and former co-star, Jon Gosselin, of stealing her hard drive and hacking into her phone and computer to get material for a tell-all book.

A federal lawsuit filed in Philadelphia on Monday by the mother-of-eight, who starred in 'Jon & Kate Plus 8' between 2007 and 2011, claims that he stole the material for a book called 'Kate Gosselin: How She Fooled the World' without her permission.

The suit says that the book was written by her ex-husband's friend, tabloid writer Robert Hoffman, but has since been pulled from Amazon because the material was obtained illegally.

The couple starred in the TV show 'Jon & Kate Plus 8', which detailed life with their twins and sextuplets. After they separated in 2009 and went through a famously bitter divorce, only Kate continued on the show with the children.

'After the couple was separated, Jon 
illegally hacked into Kate's email account and her phone and bank 
accounts,' alleges the suit, first shared on BullyVille.

'Jon
also stole a hard drive from Kate's house, which contained private and 
confidential material. Jon the gave them the contents of Kate’s email 
account and the hard drive, all of which were acquired illegality, to 
his friend and business partner, tabloid reporter Robert Hoffman.

'Hoffman used the illegally acquired data to publish a defamatory book about Kate.'

Kate is seeing compensatory, punitive, 
liquidated damages and attorney's fees and costs in what RadarOnline 
reported could be a multi-million dollar suit.

Even
though the book was dropped, 'the damage was done with the release of 
the personal and private information and the defendants continue to 
possess this illegally obtained private information.'

The suit claims that Hoffman even boasted about having 5000 family photos, personal documents, tax and business records and contracts in his possession.

Claims: The book, billed as Kate's private journal, has since been pulled from Amazon

When she confronted him, Kate, 38, said Hoffman claimed to have found the documents when he was digging through her trash on the street - which she said was impossible.

'This demonstrates his knowledge that the materials were obtained illegally, as it is a sign of an attempt to cover up his unlawful activities,' the suit alleges.

The book was billed as Kate's private journal and included passages where she talked about spanking her children with a wooden spoon and expressing her fears she would hurt them. The twin girls are now 12-years-old and the sextuplets are nine.

The alleged plot was first exposed through a series of text messages published on BullyVille.

'I'll
be back soon grabbing Kate’s computer before she gets home. I need that
hard drive,' read a tex from October 14, 2009 from a number claimed to 
belong to Jon.

'No one will know,' another text read. 'Rob is going to say he took it from our garbage.'

Jon Gosselin's lawyer has not yet responded.

Kate,
a former nurse who now runs a coupon website, lives in Sinking Spring. 
He worked in information technology and now lives in nearby Wyomissing, 
where he is reportedly working in construction. Both towns are outside 
Reading, northwest of Philadelphia.

Kate Gosselin recently gave an interview to People.com, in which she admitted: 'I made so many mistakes.'

She described how the upsides of stardom have vanished, as have the reported $24,000 per episode paychecks, and Kate has to live 'very carefully' these days to keep them going.

Her money-making schemes include releasing a cookbook, appearing on Celebrity Wife Swap with Kendra Wilkinson and launching a discount shopping site couponsbykate.com.

Kate confessed that 'to not have a reliable income is scary', but there is one thing she draws the line at - and that is appearing on TV with her ex Jon.

'There are plenty of people who would do anything to appear on television, she says. 'But I'm not that girl.'
