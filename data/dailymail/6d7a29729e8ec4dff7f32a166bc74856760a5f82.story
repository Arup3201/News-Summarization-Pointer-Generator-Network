Jack Hutton-Potts, 23, died in a climbing accident off the coast of Anglesey tethered to Vaughan Holme, the teacher who had introduced him to the sport

A boarding school teacher accidentally dragged a former student to his death in a climbing tragedy because they were tethered together.

Vaughan Holme, 48, and Jack Hutton-Potts, 23, plunged more than 300ft to their deaths down a sea cliff.

The pair had met at the prestigious Christ's Hospital School in Horsham, West Sussex, where father-of-two and housemaster Mr Holme had passed on his love of climbing.

They continued meeting and were climbing The Gauntlet at Gogarth Cliffs, near Holyhead, Wales, when the double tragedy happened in June.

An inquest heard Mr Holme, from Horsham, was probably leading the climb when he slipped and fell. The two men were tied together with a rope.

The exact reason for his fall will never be clear, the coroner said.

However, it appeared the two men had not yet hooked safety equipment which could have saved their lives into the rock face.

Pathologist Dr Mark Lord said death for Mr Hutton-Potts, from Petersfield, Hampshire, was 'instantaneous' when he drowned after suffering a significant head injury.

'He’s fallen, become unconscious and unfortunately landed in the water and drowned,' the pathologist added.

Mr Holme died of multiple injuries.

Coroner Nicola Jones said the impact of the plunge would have been devastating. 

'What we have here are two men who were very competent climbers, both very safety aware and safety conscious,' she added.

'Clearly the only conclusion I can come to is the deaths were due to an accident. We don’t know why Vaughan fell. We don’t know why Jack decided not to hook on to the cliff.'

The inquest heard the climb was challenging but well within the capabilities of both men.

Elfyn Jones, of Llanberis mountain rescue team, said it appeared Mr Hutton-Potts was waiting to climb so there may have been a 'judgement call' about whether to use a belay, a climbing tool which would fix the rope to the rock.

'Had they been belayed it’s possible the fall wouldn’t 
have had the consequences it had,' he added.

Lifeboats and an RAF rescue helicopter took part in a major search after the pair were reported missing.

Mr Jones abseiled down the cliff after the accident and spotted impact marks matching the colour of Mr Holme’s helmet.

Teacher Catherine Butters, from 
Liverpool, was taught to climb by Mr Holme and said he was 'very safe, very careful'.

Christ's Hospital School was founded in the 16th Century and now sits on a 200-acre site.

Although boarding fees are £28,000 a year, the school is rare in offering almost all its places for free or a reduced rate through a charitable scheme which funds 70% of pupils' fees.

At the time of the accident, headmaster John Franklin said: 'Christ’s Hospital is a very close-knit community and the tragic loss of a popular teacher and a young Old Blue, who were both experienced climbers, has shocked and saddened staff, pupils and the Old Blue community.'
