David Cameron’s election strategist came under fire last night  after it emerged that he was  plotting a campaign to discredit UKIP councillors.

Lynton Crosby was reported to have discussed mounting a ‘below-the-radar’ campaign to target members  of UKIP.

In a meeting with a lobbying firm, he is said to have suggested monitoring the party’s 139 councillors and trying to catch them making embarrassing comments in council meetings – which would then be leaked to the press by third parties.

The revelations sparked an angry response from UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who said the Conservative party ‘quite clearly does not trust its own membership’.

He suggested that Tory activists ‘have enormous sympathy’ for what his party is trying to do.

Mr Crosby is also said to have criticised the controversial Home Office scheme in which adverts on vans tell illegal immigrants to ‘go home’ or face arrest. He says it played into Mr Farage’s hands by giving him publicity.

The UKIP leader said the vans, which sparked accusations of racism, were ‘nasty’.

Mr Crosby told executives at Westbourne, a London-based lobbying firm, the initiative had backfired by becoming a row about ‘tactics’. He said an opportunity to attract voters who would actually support such a crackdown had been missed.

A senior Tory denied this was the view of Mr Crosby – who is on a £200,000 contract to run the party’s campaign for the 2015 election. He also denied there were plans to monitor UKIP councillors.

Any suggestion that the Tories are rattled by UKIP will pile pressure on Mr Cameron ahead of next year’s European elections in which the Eurosceptic party are set to achieve their best result.  Tory MPs with small majorities fear they may lose their seats if they are targeted by UKIP in 2015 and it splits the Right-wing vote.

Last night Mr Farage said: ‘What is most revealing about Mr Crosby’s line of attack is that he wants to bring in outside consultants to keep a watch on the hundreds of UKIP councillors, rather than trusting the Conservatives’ own elected councillors. Of course if they listened to their own activists they would find, just as the Labour Party would, that their own activists have enormous sympathy for what UKIP are trying to do –  to wrest power from the political elite and put it back where it belongs, in the hands of the men and women of this country.’

Despite speculation from MPs that Mr Crosby was behind the vans idea, Tory sources insisted the £10,000 campaign to target illegal immigrants was the idea of the Home Office, saying Mr Crosby does not get involved in policy.

The advert states: ‘In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest. Text HOME to 78070 for free advice, and help with travel documents. We can help you return home voluntarily without fear of arrest or detention.’

It has already been publicly condemned by the Lib Dems, while Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘The breathtaking stupidity of the people in charge of our immigration system knows no bounds … the fact is there is absolutely zero effort made by law-enforcement agencies to get people out when they have come in to the country unlawfully.’

Two vans will be driven around the London boroughs of Hounslow, Barking & Dagenham, Ealing, Barnet, Brent and Redbridge, displaying figures on how many illegal migrants have been arrested recently in each area.

Mr Crosby said: ‘I will confirm that I was approached by Westbourne Communications to have a meeting to discuss a range of political issues. They raised a number of issues, it was a private meeting. Somebody is being deliberately mischievous.’

James Bethell, director of Westbourne, said: ‘People in politics chit-chat about strategy, moan about their opponents and bounce ideas around all the time. It would be a grave mistake to read too much into a matey midsummer chinwag.’

A YouGov poll for The Sunday Times this weekend puts the Conservatives on 32 per cent, six points behind Labour, while UKIP is on 13 per cent, three points ahead of the Liberal Democrats.
