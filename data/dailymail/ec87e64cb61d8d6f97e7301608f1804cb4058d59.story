The new NBC summer horror show Siberia has come under vitriolic fire from none other than Siberia itself. 

The Russians are taking aim at the show, which premieres tonight, for being portraying stereotypes and pretending to depict Siberia when it was made in Manitoba.

‘In reality, this faux-reality show was filmed on the other side of the world, in a Canadian prairie province,’ storms The Siberian Times.

Siberia: The 'contestants', who are actual actors, of the new NBC show

'Not that most viewers will realise this as they watch this negatively-slanted portrayal of Siberia,’ states the English language website.

‘US viewers are conned into believing the action is in Siberia, which is after all the name of the show.’

Siberia, which is likened to Survivor, shows sixteen contestants being dropped off in winter-time, somewhere in Siberia, each trying to survive longer than the others without any equipment or food in the remote territory of Tunguska.

Their host, Jonathon Buckley (played by the real-life Jonathon Buckley, former host of Lifetime’s 2012 reality competition, Love for Sail) informs them that they need to make their way to the remains of a primitive trading outpost that was found abandoned in 1908.

When they reach the settlement they discover the fires are still burning and the food is still cooking on the stoves, but all the inhabitants have vanished.

The mock reality series shows the participants, who are in fact actors, chasing the $500,000 prize for survival in 
the harsh conditions.

NBC and the show's US production companies are also being accused of ‘censoring’ Siberians from seeing online trailers and a pilot episode which is supposedly full of thrills, spills and scare tactics.

When they try to look at it, Russian viewers from the Urals to the Pacific are shown a message reading: ‘We're sorry, but the clip you selected isn't available in your location’ even though they trying to tune in from Siberia.

The Siberian Times accused the show of being ‘in keeping with the US stereotype of Siberia, mixed with a cocktail of Hollywood horrors and then frozen in a Cold War time warp'.

The pre-publicity for the show says the participants suddenly encounter a tiger, which brings more mockery from the news website.

‘It must have escaped from a Canadian zoo because Tunguska would be some three time zones west from the habitat of the nearest Siberian tiger.'

The critique continues: ‘Siberia's image in the world which takes another hit, just at a time when it is rightly recovering a more positive image around the world, with inward investment and foreign tourism growing significantly.

'These investors and tourists come in search of the real modern Siberia, unlike the makers of this TV fake.' 

The Siberian Times goes on to say: ‘This clearly is of no interest to NBC and those who made this series in Manitoba, namely Infinity Films Productions in association with Sierra-Engine Television and the appropriately named Welldone Productions.’
