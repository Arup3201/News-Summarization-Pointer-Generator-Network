A rising number of childless couples who are struggling to conceive naturally are launching crowdfunding campaigns in hopes of raising money for expensive fertility treatments; from family, friends, and strangers alike.

Dierdre Alby, a 40-year-old marketing director, and her 34-year-old husband Harold, who live in New York, have been struggling with infertility for two years and are aiming to drum up $32,000 from their GoFundMe campaign, to pay for a 'last hope' IVF session in hopes of achieving their baby dream.

'Any donation level is welcome... even if you only have $5 to donate we will be thrilled!' the couple write on their page, which has so far raised $3,664. 'If you do have the financial freedom, please consider a donation of $100 - if we can get 300 people to give this amount we will be able to have our child!'

'Harold took a lot of persuading, because he didn’t like the idea of airing our laundry in public,' Mrs Alby tells Jane Ridley at the New York Post of their decision to launch the campaign. 'But now he’s amazed at the kindness and generosity that people have shown.'

Mrs Alby, who has already undergone several rounds of failed IVF and burned through their $42,000 savings, has found a Virginia clinic which promises that if after six attempts, they don't come home with a healthy baby, they will have their costs refunded.

It is unclear exactly why IVF has been unsuccessful so far in this particular case, but Mrs Alby writes: 'What happens naturally for millions of couples every year was unlikely to happen naturally for us.'

Unusual as this last-ditch effort might sound, it's becoming an increasingly popular strategy for cash-strapped and desperate couples eager to start families.

GoFundMe claims that over $1.1million in funding has been raised worldwide for its 'Babies, Kids and Family' category since its 2010 launch. And donations in the last six months alone were a third higher than those raised in the entirety of 2013.

In Vitro Fertilization is the process of fertilization by manually combining an egg and sperm in a laboratory dish.

When the IVF procedure is successful, the process is combined with a procedure known as embryo transfer, which involves physically placing the embryo in the uterus.

IVF costs an average of $12,400 per session in the U.S., and its success rate varies significantly according to a range of factors, especially age.

For women under 35, the success rate is 30 to 35per cent, and for women over 40, it's between six and 10per cent.

According to Mr and Mrs Alby, responses to their campaign have been largely positive, but for a few suggestions that the couple should 'just adopt' instead, which Mrs Alby admits 'stung a little.' She points out that adoption isn't necessarily easier or even less costly than IVF. If they fail to raise the remaining $27,000 within a month, the couple have the opportunity to take out a loan with the clinic.

Jessica Lahl, president of the Center for Bioethics and Culture, is an activist who stands against certain fertility interventions and recently produced Breeders; a documentary which questions the ethics of surrogacy.

'It’s pretty cynical and presumptuous to ask friends, family and strangers for money for crazy expensive IVF,' she tells the Post.

'It’s tacky and tasteless. What are they going to ask for next? The child’s private school or college fund?

'The whole thing operates at the Hallmark sentiment. It’s a case of, "We want it, so give it to us now."'

Fingers crossed: Vanessa Richmond (pictured with her husband) has never ovulated, and needs $2,000 for 'tests, surgery, medication, and doctors'

A quick search on GoFundMe, however, reveals plenty of other childless couples who are going the same route.

Scott and Jay Paranada Fried, a newly married gay couple based in Manhattan, New York, are appealing for $5,000 to help with their surrogacy costs, and hope to have twins. As an incentive, they are offering 'a photo with the babies' to those who donate $50, and for $100, donors can have 'two free hours with the babies.' They have so far raised $145.

'It’s tacky and tasteless. What are they going to ask for next? The child’s private school or college fund?'

Vanessa Richmond and her husband, from Racine, Wisconsin, have struggled both with their fertility issues, and with their efforts to raise much money on GoFundMe.

'I have several cysts on my ovaries and my LH levels were extremely high... Basically I have never ovulated,' she writes on her page, which has raised $135 in nine months. 'Tests, surgery, medication, and Doctors, we will see!'

Needs must: Georgia (left) and Shawn Daniel (right) aren't covered by their insurance. 'We must pay for all medications, ultrasounds, procedures, and blood work out of pocket' they claim, and have so far raised $789 towards their $15,000 goal

Georgia and Shawn Daniel, from Missouri City, Texas, have been trying to conceive for almost nine years. 'I have PCOS and Hypothyroid,' writes Mrs Daniel.

'My insurance excludes all fertility treatment in any form of coverage. We must pay for all medications, ultrasounds, procedures, and blood work out of pocket.' They have so far raised $789 towards their $15,000 goal.

According to the latest report from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, more women are turning to IVF than ever before, with over 165,172 procedures performed in the last recorded year, 2012, and 61,740 babies born as a result.

The success rate for women under the age of 35 using their own eggs was about 40per cent. For women between ages 35 and 37, it dropped to 31per cent, and for 42-year-olds, the rate was only 3.9per cent.

'We must pay for all medications, ultrasounds, procedures, and blood work out of pocket'

And contrary to the huge spike in women turning to IVF in hopes of conceiving - a process which costs an average of $12,400 for one round -  natural births have been declining dramatically in America since 2007, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It remains to be seen whether fertility-challenged couples will win success from the hearts of the public in the form of hefty donations, but regardless, the enterprising trend looks like it's here to stay.
