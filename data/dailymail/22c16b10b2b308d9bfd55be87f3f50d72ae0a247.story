Defending champion Serena Williams was thrashed 6-0 6-2 by Simona Halep at the WTA Finals in Singapore.

The 18-time Grand Slam champion was remarkably off her game against the world No 4, who had never beaten the American.

Halep won the first set in just 20 minutes, as Williams could only put seven points on the board, suffering a bagel set for only the eighth time in her illustrious career.

Williams couldn’t cope with Halep’s extraordinary shot making and depth in her game as the Romanian crushed the US Open champion within an hour of play.

Having defeated Ana Ivanovic 6-4, 6-4 on Monday in her first red group match, it would have been expected Williams, who had made 16 consecutive victories at the WTA Finals, to ease past Halep having won their three previous meetings.

However Halep, brought a high level to the court and pounced on Williams’ temperamental serve to race to the first set.

Williams failed to recover, making 36 unforced errors and was broken five times during a flawless performance by Halep.

The world No 1 will now need to beat Canadian Eugenie Bouchard in the next group match in Singapore to advance to the semi-finals.

After the victory a stunned Halep, who beat a top three player for the first time, expressed her delight: ‘It’s the biggest win of my life.

‘I’m really happy as it was a dream of mine to beat one of the Williams sisters one day.

‘I’m sure it wasn’t her best tennis today but I played aggressive, opened up the court really well and fought for every point.

‘It’s crazy! I feel unbelievable right now but I have to quickly forget this and finish the tournament before I can party.’ 

Bouchard's chances of qualifying from the red group are slim after losing 6-1, 6-3 to Ana Ivanovic.
