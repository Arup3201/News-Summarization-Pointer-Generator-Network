One of the few remaining British survivors of a German prisoner of war camp immortalised in The Great Escape film has died aged 91.

Royal Air Force gunner Frank Stone, of Hathersage, Derbyshire, was taken to Stalag Luft III in Zagan as a teenager during the Second World War after his bomber crashed in Mannheim in 1940.

He was in hut 104, home to 76 airmen who tried to escape via a 348ft tunnel in 1944. But the alarm was raised before Mr Stone, who had helped dispose of soil from the tunnel, could join them.

Of the 76 men who attempted to make a break for freedom using the tunnel, known as Harry, 50 were later shot after being recaptured - and only three managed to get away successfully.

Mr Stone - finally freed towards the end of the war - returned in 2009 to the camp in Poland, which was originally German territory and held about 10,000 RAF crew at the height of its occupation.

The escape from the camp was the single greatest freedom attempt by POWs in the war. Among the 50 who were shot was Roger Bushell, the mastermind of the plot which hoped to free over 200 men.

Some 26 of the 76 who tried to escape were returned to the camp while three made ‘home runs’ to Britain. All 29 have since died. Mr Stone helped the escape committee draw up the tunnel plans.

The original plan was for three tunnels, codenamed Tom, Dick and Harry.  But Tom was discovered soon after it was started, and it was decided to use Dick to store the spoil from Harry as it was dug.

'The tension was electric the night of the escape. And then around dawn I heard a shot and barking and I knew it was all over'

'I was given a chance to go on the escape but the priority was given to those men who had the best chance - German speakers and the like. It was a lottery and my number didn’t come up,' Mr Stone said in an interview in 2011.

'The tension was electric the night of the escape. And then around dawn I heard a shot and barking and I knew it was all over.'

He said the character of Archie Ives in the film - the Scotsman played by Angus Lenny who was machine-gunned by the watchtower guards - was based on his real-life friend Jimmy Kiddel.

Also there at the visit in March 2009 was
 Alfie ‘Bill’ Fripp, 95, who was married one month before he was shot 
down in October 1939, and remained a prisoner of the Germans until May 
1945.

Mr Stone’s widow, Jane, 69, said: ‘He gave lots of talks about the escape and always said he was doing it in memory of those 50.

'Frank could never understand why people where so interested in him, but they were'

‘Frank could never understand 
why people where so interested in him, but they were.  We often had to 
put extra talks on so more people could come.’

In
 1947, 18 soldiers who shot those who were recaptured, were put before 
the English Military Tribunal in Hamburg. Thirteen of them were 
executed, with the rest receiving long prison sentences.

The story of the escape was made into a
 film in 1963, starring actors Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Donald
 Pleasence. Decades later, the 2000 film Chicken Run was based on the 
movie.

On a later visit in 2011, the efforts of the airmen who inspired the film were recreated by a historian.

Lighting a candle: Mr Stone - finally freed towards the end of the war - returned in 2009 to the camp in Poland, which was originally German territory and held about 10,000 RAF crew at the height of its occupation

The tunnel used by POWs for their 
escape - made from 4,000 bed boards and dug with thousands of pieces of 
cutlery - was rebuilt using the same makeshift tools and materials used 
by the inmates.

Other 
materials used by the prisoners included 90 double bunk beds, 635 
mattresses, 3,424 towels - and also about 1,400 milk cans to create an 
ingenious ventilation system.

The
 PoWs should not have succeeded in their escape because the camp was 
deliberately built on a type of sandy soil that was meant to make it 
impossible for them to build such a tunnel.

Cambridge
 University historian Dr Hugh Hunt went back to the site to build a 33ft
 imitation along with a team of experts, archaeologists, veterans and 
modern-day RAF personnel.

Mr
 Stone then demonstrated using a trolley at the entrance to the escape 
tunnel’s recreation, which was documented in Channel 4 programme Digging
 the Great Escape in November 2011.

The airman, who died on Tuesday in a Hathersage nursing home, was born in 
the village of Quarndon, near Derby, and volunteered to join the RAF 
when was 18.

He
 was posted to 83 Squadron at Scampton under the command of Dambusters 
hero Guy Gibson, who asked him to volunteer for the mission when his 
Handley Page Hampden bomber was shot down.

Mrs Stone said: ‘Frank was an orderly to the engineer who drew 
up the escape plans so he had full knowledge of what was going on.

‘It
 was decided the first 50 to escape would be the ones who had the best 
chance of reaching freedom, those who could speak German or had some 
knowledge of German.

‘Frank's
 name went into the hat for the order of escape. A total of 200 were to 
go out first followed by a second 200 the following night. Frank was no 
215 so he never got a chance.’

Mr
 Stone, who was promoted to Warrant Officer while in the camp, survived 
the 'Long March' which claimed 300 lives when the Germans evacuated 
prisoners with the Russians approaching.

He was later finally freed and returned home. The couple, who have a daughter and three grandchildren, married in 1969.

Mr Stone carved out a career as a civil servant, retiring when he was 62. He was a member of the RAF's Ex-POW Association and Bomber Command Association.

He was playing golf and gardening just a few weeks before his death.

Mrs Stone added: ‘He gave talks wherever and whenever people wanted him and it was an emotional time for him when returned to Germany to the site of the camp.

‘He saw The Great Escape and always used to say what was shown on the camp in the film was the truth but everything filmed outside the camp was pure Hollywood.

‘But he said if the film had never been made then no one would ever have heard the story of the great escape and it was a story that should never be forgotten.’

The funeral service will be next Friday at St Michael and All Angels Church in Hathersage, before the burial in the village cemetery.
