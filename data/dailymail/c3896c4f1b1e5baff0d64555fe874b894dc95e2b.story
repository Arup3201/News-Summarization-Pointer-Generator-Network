Charged: Tara Mauney, 41, allegedly purchased 108 rolls of toilet paper for the caper

A suburban Dallas mother charged in a bizarre vandalism prank faces up to two years in prison and a hefty fine after she allegedly helped some middle 
school students prank a classmate's slumber party last year.

Tara Mauney, 41, was indicted Thursday

She allegedly purchased 108 rolls of toilet paper for the caper and lead the group of students to put raw chicken in the mailbox, a toilet on the front lawn and graffiti on the home, causing $6,000 worth of damage.

The pranksters were eventually spotted by the girls at the slumber party, who chased them to Mauney's home.

At the time, her attorneys denied the charges against her, and claimed that she was only hosting a sleepover party for a group of girls at her home.

If convicted, Mauney faces up to 2 years in jail and a $10,000 fine, according to The Dallas Morning News.

None of the children were charged.

According to an affidavit obtained by MailOnline, officers arrived at Jodie Rishel's home early July 25 to find the entire residence covered in toilet paper.

They found raw chicken stuffed inside the mailbox and a toilet placed in the center of the driveway in front of the home with the words 'suck it' written in permanent marker on it.

'[The Officer] also observed that written on the light colored exterior stucco walls of the home, in the covered drive area, were numerous writings, such as "whore house", "CMS jokes", "suck it", and "sluts" in black "sharpie" style ink. "Sluts" was written on the circle driveway in what appeared to be mustard, which had dried,' the arrest compliant read.

Peanut butter was smeared on the pillars of the driveway and tampons and other sanitary napkins - soaked in ketchup - were stuck on the front windows of the home.

Vandalized: When the pranksters were spotted by by the slumber party girls, they chased them to the home of Mauney, who they recognized from school functions, though her attorneys have denied any and all claims against her

Mrs Rishel said that she was hosting her
12-year-old daughter's friends for a pool party and slumber party that 
evening when they observed a boy peering over a back fence and watching 
them.

The girls chased after the boy - who fled with a group of other children they recognized from school - to the home of Tara Mauney, a few blocks away.

Mauney, who the girls recognized from school functions, allegedly stopped outside of her home and asked the girls 'Could I help you?'

'You can clean up the mess you just made,' one of the girls responded, according to police.

Police were called as well as the girls parents, which is when one of the girls' mothers remembered that she had seen Mauney shopping at the local Walmart at 10:30 pm that evening, with eight middle school aged children.

Security footage of the store revealed Mauney 'chaperoning' a group of three boys and five girls posing for a photograph inside the store before they purchased three 36-roll packages of toilet paper.

Red-Handed? Mauney, who the girls recognized from school functions, allegedly stopped outside of her home and asked the girls 'Could I help you?'

Police say the group struck another home that night as well.

Mauney, who is free on $7,500 bail, faces a maximum of two years in jail and a $10,000 fine for the deeds.

When reached Monday by the Star-Telegram, Mauney declined to comment other than to say that 'the kids have retracted some statements.'

Her attorney, Brian Willett, says that Mauney denies the charges and is prepared to take a polygraph test.

'She was never at that place,' Mr Willett said Monday. 'They are saying that she did the writing, but she wasn't there.'

Two boys who allegedly took part in the prank have come forward to police to confess their actions. Mauney has been the only one charged so far and is scheduled to appear in court next week.
