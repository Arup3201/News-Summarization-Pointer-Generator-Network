Actress Olivia Wilde has opened up about the joys of pregnancy in an interview for the May edition of Lucky magazine.

The 30-year-old Tron star, whose May 4th due date is a mere two weeks away, admits that although she initially wanted to hide her bump 'forever', she ended up showing it off at every opportunity, referring to it as 'a badge of pride'.

'I’m a woman!  Look at me making a human! I am a goddess!' she exclaims.

The radiant mother-to-be also reveals that her pregnancy has made her feel more connected to other women, in a way she never has before, and also to her unborn son.

'He’s moving around in there and no one else can tell - it’s a little secret friendship,' she says.

Miss Wilde, who is engaged to actor and comedian Jason Sudeikis, 38, explains that one of the more profound changes she has undergone since becoming pregnant is her heightened sense of empathy. 'You look at everyone and you think, You were a baby!' she says.

The dedicated philanthropist speaks at length about her nonprofit, Conscious Commerce; a company which encourages consumers to shop from brands, such as Toms shoes, that are 'doing something positive' in the world. The company was born after Miss Wilde's 2010 visit to Haiti's earthquake aftermath, which threw her into what she describes as a 'maniacal fund-raising mode'.

She also delves into her 'messy' personal style, citing Bob Marley and Keith Richards as unlikely early fashion icons, and mentions Eva Longoria as being the antitheses of her own laid-back approach to dressing.

'Eva Longoria always looks so put-together and goddamned adorable,' she remarks. 'But I can’t imagine walking everywhere in those heels. She goes to the Laundromat with them on! I just don’t have it in me.'

All grown up: She doesn't look it here, but Miss Wilde refers to her style as 'messy', admitting she was a 'thrifty' tomboy in her teenage years

Miss Wilde claims she was a tomboy in her teenage years, stealing clothes from her father's closet, and says 'thrifty girl' was her nickname at the time.

'I couldn’t imagine paying more than $20 for a pair of jeans,' she admits.

These days, the actress counts upmarket brands including Rick Owens, Rag & Bone and James Pearse - her new 'savoir' in terms of maternity wear - as her go-to labels.

Miss Wilde also appears to have developed into something of a Francophile, mentioning Adele Exarchopoulos - the French star of recent indie hit Blue is the Warmest Color - as a new style influence.

'When in doubt, look to the French,' she says.

'For literally everything in life. It’s just minimalism at its best.'

She fondly recalls seeing girls in Paris wearing vintage tees tucked into pencil skirts a few years ago, stating: 'I remember thinking, I’m going to go home and buy a bunch of pencil skirts so I can do that.

Staying busy: The expectant mother, pictured last Thursday at a Revlon fundraiser, reveals she would much rather play a 'basket-case mess' role than a femme fatale

'The same thing happened with suspenders. I saw someone in suspenders and I thought, Yes! Suspenders are everything!'

The stunning expectant mother concludes by revealing that when it comes to her ideal role, the 'basket-case mess' trumps the 'ideal girl' every time.

'Now when I look at roles, if it says, "In walks in the femme fatale, the epitome of perfection and desire," I say, "No, that’s not going to work"' she explains.

'I’m not interested unless she turns out to be psychotic and murders everyone in the room. I’d rather be Ursula than the Little Mermaid.'
