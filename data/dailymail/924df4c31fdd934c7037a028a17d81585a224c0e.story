Fury: More than £1.7million has already been spent trying to deport hate cleric Abu Qatada

Lawyers for hate preacher Abu Qatada have received more than £860,000 in legal aid, it emerged last night.

The total bill to the taxpayer of trying to deport the Islamist fanatic is more than £1.7million since 2005.

Outraged MPs said the money could have employed 90 police constables for a year.

Farcically, after devouring such huge sums of money, Qatada has dropped his appeal against being sent back to Jordan on terror charges.

He intends to leave the country voluntarily – providing a new treaty protecting his human rights is ratified.

The revelations will fuel the debate over the huge sums being spent on legal aid.

Over the past eight years, Qatada’s lawyers have been paid £864,944, according to figures released by the Home Office yesterday.

Of this, the authorities have managed to claw back only £217,286 by selling assets belonging to the preacher, who was once dubbed ‘Osama bin Laden’s spiritual ambassador in Europe’.

The cost to the Government of trying to boot him out has been a further £938,630 in the domestic courts, and £130,018 at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

It gives a net total of £1,716,306, the Home Office said in a letter to the Commons home affairs select committee.

Chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘I am shocked that Abu Qatada’s legal costs alone could have employed 90 new constables for  a year.’

Qatada has repeatedly used human rights laws to thwart his removal to Jordan.

Battle: Home Secretary Theresa May has negotiated a new treaty on human rights with Jordan in a bid to deport Qatada

He claimed his trial for plotting a terror attack would be unfair because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture.

This argument, originally rejected by the British courts, was upheld by judges in Strasbourg.

It forced Home Secretary Theresa May to seek new legal guarantees from Jordan that Qatada’s rights would not be breached. The case then began again in the British courts and was expected to take years.

But in a shock move earlier this year,  Qatada said he would return home voluntarily when the treaty Mrs May agreed with  Jordan was signed – probably by the end of this month.

Qatada is behind bars in London’s Belmarsh prison after breaching a bail condition that restricts use of mobile phones and other communication devices.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be disgusted at the amount of their cash this vile hate preacher has cost us.

‘On top of these legal costs for the Government, there is the legal aid and benefits he has enjoyed, not to mention security costs.

‘The European Court of Human Rights has effectively landed British taxpayers with this eye-watering bill.’
