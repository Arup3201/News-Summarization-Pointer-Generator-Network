Detectives have been given more time to question a 22-year-old man suspected of the murder of a mother-of-five found stabbed to death in a paddock in the New Forest as she tended to her horses.

Two men and a woman were arrested in connection with the murder of Penelope Davis, known as Pennie, who had been stabbed multiple times when she was found by her husband, Pete, near Beaulieu, Hampshire, on Tuesday.

Mr Davis was seen ‘sobbing his heart out’ next to her body.

Magistrates have given detectives a further 24 hours to continue questioning the man held on suspicion of murder. 

A 37-year-old man, who was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, has been bailed until October 23.

A 24-year-old woman also remains in custody.

A Hampshire police spokeswoman said: 'Police continue to appeal to the public for any information which may help the investigation.' 

Specialist forensics police officers have carried out fingertip searches of the field where Mrs Davis was found.

Police have also increased patrols in the area to offer reassurance to shocked residents. 

More than 150 members of the public had responded to a police appeal for information to help find the killer.

The victim's parents, Mr Davis and his children, Sophie, 20, Alex, 19, Georgia, 18, Daniel, 14, and Josef, 13, have visited the paddock since the killing, leaving flowers with messages from each member of the family. 

One of her daughters, Georgia, left a note saying: 'Dearest mum, you were a goddess. I swear I'll make you proud. I like to think you're sitting there, watching on a cloud. 

'You had so much more to give. You had so much more to do. But now I'll be your legacy. I'll do it all for you.

'You climbed the highest mountains, you walked the longest plains, you'll never be forgotten. Forever in our hearts. I love you to the moon and back.'

The family, in a statement read by the police, said they were devastated by the death of a 'remarkable person' and 'devoted mother'. 

Mrs Davis lived with her husband in the village of Blackfield, five miles from where she died, where she worked at a small branch of Sainsbury’s.

Detectives admitted on Saturday that they faced a difficult job delving into Mrs Davis’s complex personal life, her business affairs and also her involvement as a director in several electrical companies in recent years. 

Detectives have been given another 24 hours to question a 22-year-old man who is suspected of murder
