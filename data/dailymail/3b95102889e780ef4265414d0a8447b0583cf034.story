Workmen have been left looking rather red-faced after making this embarrassing mistake outside a primary school.

These pictures show how council workmen somehow managed to spell 'school' wrong outside  Innellan Primary School, near Dunoon, in Scotland.

The no-parking road sign outside the tiny village primary is instead spelt 'sckool'.

Embarrassing: The workmen who wrote this no-parking sign outside Innellan Primary School, near Dunoon, Scotland, are hardly likely to get top marks for spelling

Accurate: The workmen at least managed to spell 'keep clear' correctly

The embarrassing mistake was spotted by an eagle-eyed photographer in the tiny village of Innellan, which is on the Clyde coast.

It is to be hoped the sign is fixed before the tiny school's 154 pupils return from their summer holidays.

It is not the first time workmen have been left red-faced by embarrassing signs.

Residents in Kettering, Northamptonshire, were left bemused last year when they woke up to discover bumbling workmen had somehow managed to misspell 'clear' on a road sign - instead telling drivers to 'KEEP CELAR'.

The giant lettering, measuring a metre high, was painted across the entrance to a small cul-de-sac.

Embarrassed council chiefs quickly ordered the sign to be repainted once the mistake was spotted.

A spokesman from Northamptonshire County Council blamed the incident on 'human error'.

Silly: It's not clear how bumbling workmen got the spelling of this huge Keep Clear sign quite so wrong

Oops! This previous blunder in east London may be even more embarrassing

Road painters have previously misspelled a word in two-foot high neon yellow letters at a bus lane in Canning Town, east London, that marked out a 'Sus Stop'.

Workers for Kirklees Council also managed to make a mistake in their bus stop road markings - instead writing 'Bus Sotp'.

In front of Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Primary School in Bristol workmen also created the bold legend 'SHOOL'.

That one lasted only a few days until painters returned to add the vital 'C'.
