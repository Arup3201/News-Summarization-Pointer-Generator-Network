MPs are pocketing even more expenses than they were before the 2009 scandal – with many putting family members on the payroll, figures showed yesterday.

Taxpayers last year funded a record £103million of allowances. In 2008 – the year before the expenses scandal broke – the figure was £102million.

Part of the increase is down to a rise in the number of MPs employing relatives and business associates on the public payroll. Some 168 parliamentarians – more than a quarter – listed wives, children and even parents on their expenses returns last year, costing taxpayers more than £4million. This is up 8 per cent on the 155 who did so the year before.

The total bill for MPs' expenses is now more than it was during the 2009 scandal, figures published revealed today

Tory backbenchers Peter Bone and Christopher Chope both employ their wives on salaries of up to £50,000, the figures from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority reveal.

Critics say the perk – which five Cabinet ministers also take advantage of – allows politicians to increase their household income at the expense of the State.

The figures also show that some MPs are paying their staff large bonuses, funded by the taxpayer. Conor Burns paid one aide a ‘reward and recognition’ payment of £2,000. Fellow Tory Mike Weatherley paid out a series of bonuses adding up to £1,950.

Last night Andy Silvester of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Taxpayers will be deeply concerned that the cost of Westminster is going up again. David Cameron specifically pledged to reduce the cost of politics after the excesses of the expenses scandal, and politicians must be held accountable for their promises.

‘Combined with the ever-increasing number of peers in the House of Lords, that promise looks increasingly difficult to keep.

‘There’s nothing wrong with employing family members if they’re qualified for the job, but there needs to be total transparency whenever that’s the case.’

The bill for MPs’ expenses rose by 5 per cent last year, but IPSA says that once inflation is taken into account, the expenses total is lower than the pre-expenses scandal peak.

The organisation added that it had saved more than £50million for the taxpayer since it was set up.

The surge in family employment reflects a rule change that allows MPs to spend more on staff and, by using relatives, to top up their household income.

In 2011/12, they were allowed to claim only £115,000 a year for staff. But that was increased in 2012/13 to £144,000 for London MPs to reflect higher costs in the capital. Other MPs claim up to £137,000.

The public outcry over MPs employing family members began in 2008, when Tory MP Derek Conway was accused of paying his two sons for non-existent jobs. Calls for the rules to be changed intensified after the expenses scandal broke a year later.

Last year’s £103million expenses total consists of £81million on staff, £11million on accommodation, travel and subsistence, and £11million on office costs.

The biggest claim was by the DUP’s Jim Shannon, whose total spend was £229,262, including more than £38,215 on travel reflecting the cost of getting to and from his Strangford constituency, and £12,126 on hotels.

IPSA chairman Sir Ian Kennedy said the system was saving money compared to the discredited regime that led to the expenses scandal. He said: ‘As part of our system of regulation, we have reduced the cost to the taxpayer by £58million. Such is the progress made since the scandals which came to light in 2009, our work is attracting the attention of parliaments around the world.’

Five Cabinet ministers – Patrick McLoughlin, Chris Grayling, Michael Fallon, Stephen Crabb and Francis Maude – have family members on the public payroll.

A spokesman for IPSA said: ‘The two figures are not truly comparable, due to the impact of inflation. The £102million figure, uprated using the GDP deflators used by the Treasury for the Budget, produces a figure of £113million for this year.’
