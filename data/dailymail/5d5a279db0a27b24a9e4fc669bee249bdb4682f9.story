Jose Mourinho is still backing Brazil to win the World Cup - even after losing star man Neymar to injury and captain Thiago Silva to suspension ahead of their semi final clash with Germany.

And the Chelsea manager believes the loss of PSG centre back Silva will be more of a problem against the Germans than that of Neymar.

The Brazilian captain picked up a needless yellow card for a challenge on goalkeeper David Ospina in the 2-1 win over Colombia that ruled him out of the semi final after also being booked in the group stage draw with Mexico.

Big misses: Thiago Silva and Neymar will both be missing against Germany in the semi finals

And Mourinho said that while their talismanic forward was a big loss, Silva's absence will be the biggest threat to Brazil's hopes of reaching their dream final at the Maracana.

'Brazil needs him (Neymar) because he's that individual player that can win one against ones and unbalance situations for the opponent and score a goal,' he said. 'He's fantastic also in the service for the set pieces.

'But I would say that Thiago Silva in this moment is so more 
important than Neymar in the team,' he said.

'His absence is an important 
absence because Brazil's game is based on their defensive structure 
where Thiago Silva gives great stability to the team.

'Of course they 
have Henrique and Dante as an option to play - maybe because Dante plays in Germany and in the same team as every one of the
 other German players, he is the elected one but Thiago is 
an important player for them.'

But Mourinho still believes Brazil will go on to win the tournament on home soil despite their significant absentees.

Replacements: Dante or Henrique could replace Silva in the heart of Brazil's defence

'I think Brazil is a fighting team. Every player is giving absolutely everything and that is something I respect.

'But the reality is that they don't play quality football, they don't use the quality of so many good players but I think they know what they are doing. They have it clear in their minds.

'In the second half (against Colombia) you could see perfectly Brazil not trying to play, not trying to keep the ball, everybody defending, with a big effort from everyone.

'I think the end of the story will see Brazil as champions by respect of the fact that they are showing they are a team and they are giving everything to win the competition. They're doing everything for their country and nobody can criticise their philosophy.
