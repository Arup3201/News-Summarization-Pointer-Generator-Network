Carl Chang, 26, has been jailed for four years after a single drop of blood left as he broke into a home in Maidstone lead forensic teams to him

A single drop of blood left at the scene of the crime helped cops nail a serial burglar.

Carl Chang was in the process of breaking into a home in Maidstone, Kent, on June 27 last year, when he got a tiny nick on his hand as he smashed a kitchen window to sneak in.

The lone drop of blood was spotted by forensics officers, who were called to the scene within hours of the offence taking place, in which cash and jewellery were stolen.

Despite Chang, 26, cleaning the window and various doors with cleaning fluid in a bid to get rid of his fingerprints and any traces he had been there, he didn't notice to single drop of his blood on the kitchen doorstep by the smashed window.

The serial crook, who had only recently been released from jail after serving time for another burglary, was arrested after cops traced his DNA to previous break-ins in the Kent area.

When he was arrested at his home in Orpington, Kent, on July 9 last year he lunged at officers in a desperate bid to get away, but was jailed for four years at Maidstone Crown Court on Monday  after pleading guilty to burglary.

A spokesman for Kent Police said this week: 'A burglar has been jailed for four years after a drop of his blood was detected on the doorstep of a home in Maidstone.

'Kent Police matched Carl Chang's DNA to a small blood stain, following a break-in last year.

'Chang smashed a kitchen window to enter the property on 27 June 2014. The 26-year-old stole cash and jewellery before fleeing the scene.'

He added: 'After the victim alerted police, crime scene investigators attended the address and detected a fresh drop of blood on a step directly outside the point of entry.

'The blood sample was sent off for forensic analysis and was later identified as a match for Chang.

Maidstone Crown Court heard Chang is a prolific burglar who was out on licence for another break-in when he raided the Kent home last year, making off with jewellery and cash

'Inside the property Chang had used cleaning fluid, in an attempt to remove further evidence of his offending.'

Detective Constable Natalie Sammells said: 'At the time of the offence Chang had been on license, following his release from prison for another burglary.

'He is clearly a prolific burglar, whose offending has caused a great deal of distress to the victims, not only through the loss of their personal property, but the invasion of their private space.

'We will continue to pursue all forensic techniques available to gather evidence to bring offenders like Chang to justice and I'm pleased that another repeat offender is behind bars and unable to commit any further crimes.'
