The lone survivor of a trio of men who were lost at sea has told how he desperately tried to flag down a passing cruise ship but watched, helplessly, as it sailed away.

Adrian Vásquez, 18, said he was enraged the Star Princess did not stop to save him and his two friends despite being spotted by passengers on board.

Vásquez said he and his friends had gone fishing on the tiny boat on February 24 when the engine broke down.

Out of mobile phone range, they had no choice but to survive on fish they had caught and hoped they would be spotted.

Since being rescued  Vásquez has told how he used a piece of red cloth to try and flag the vessel down.

Vásquez said he immediately shouted to his two friends Elvis Oropeza Betancourt, 31, and Fernando Osario, 16, that he had spotted the ship.

Though very weak and near death, Elvis also joined in by using a brightly coloured life jacket.

The ship didn't stop, and the tiny fishing boat drifted for another two weeks before it was found. By then, Vásquez's two friends had died.

'"I said, 'God will not forgive them,"' he said, 'Today, I still feel rage when I remember that.'

The cruise ship, which is owned by Carnival - the same corporation behind the operators of the Cost Concordia - which capsized earlier this year, apparently passed fishing boat Fifty Cent off the coast of Panama and despite passengers raising the alarm, did not detour to pick up the three fishermen.

Two birdwatchers on the deck of the 
luxury cruise ship spotted the stricken men with a long-range telescope
and saw one of them waving a red cloth to attract their attention.

Jeff Gilligan and Judy Meredith, 
both from Oregon, raised the alarm with a sales representative on the 
ship, showing him through the telescope what they could see.

Barred from going to the bridge 
themselves, they relied on him to pass on the message to the captain, 
which he assured them he had done.

'You don't wave a shirt like that just to be friendly, said Ms Meredith. 'He was desperate to get our attention.'

But when the ship continued on its course and nothing happened, the passengers began to worry.

Ms Meredith went to her cabin and 
noted their coordinates from a TV feed from the ship, emailing the 
information to both the US Costa Guard and her son.

'We were kind of freaking out, thinking we don't see anything else happening,' she said.

Mr Gilligan could no longer bear to watch. 'It was very disturbing,' he said. 'We asked other people, "What do you think we should do?" Their reaction was: "Well, you've done what you could do." Whether something else could have been done, that's a bit frustrating to think about.'

After Elvis and Fernando died, Vásquez was eventually picked up by a fishing boat off Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, more than 600 miles from where they had set out.

Vásquez said he slipped their bodies into the sea after they began to rot in the heat. Before he was rescued, a rainstorm gave him fresh water to drink, helping him survive.

Throughout the ordeal, he thought about his eight brothers, and never gave up hope.

Safe at home, Vásquez said he recognized their boat from the photos Mr Gilligan had taken with his 300 mm lens.

'Yes, that's it. That's it. That is us,' he said. 'You can see there, the red sweater I'm waving and, above it is the sheet that we put up to protect us from the sun.'

Vásquez mentioned the ship in his first statement to Panamanian authorities when he returned to his country.

Back at home in Oregon, Meredith couldn't sleep, wondering what happened to the men.

Reading a news story about a Panamanian rescued off Ecuador after 28 days in an open boat, she figured that was the boat they had seen. She pestered Princess Cruises, the Coast Guard, and even the Panamanian embassy.

'We were all just sick about it, and just wanted to believe the ship notified someone,' she said.

Meanwhile, the captain of the vessel, has said he is devastated that the message was not relayed to him.

Captain Edward Perrin is one of the company's most experienced and said he would never knowingly turn his back on someone who was stranded.

In a statement released by the company, it said: 'Princess Cruises deeply regrets that two Panamanian men perished at sea after their boat became disabled in early March.

'Since we became aware of this incident, we have been investigating circumstances surrounding the claim that Star Princess failed to come to the aid of the disabled boat, after a crew member was alerted by passengers.

'The preliminary results of our investigation have shown that there appeared to be a breakdown in communication in relaying the passenger's concern. Neither Captain Edward Perrin nor the officer of the watch were notified.

'Understandably, Captain Perrin is devastated that he is being accused of knowingly turning his back on people in distress. Had the Captain received this information, he would have had the opportunity to respond.

'We all understand that it is our responsibility and also the law of the sea to provide assistance to any vessel in distress, and it is not an uncommon occurrence for our ships to be involved in a rescue at sea.

'In fact, we have done so more than 30 times in the last ten years. We deeply regret this incident and are continuing our investigation to fully understand the circumstances.'
