Home ownership may be what many Australians dream of but the reality of how much your castle will finally cost reads more like a nightmare, as a mortgage of less than $500,000 will actually set you back more than $1 million by the time it's paid.

Michelle Hutchison, Money Expert with finder.com.au, told Daily Mail Australia that the hefty price tag 'is not meant to put people off but show home-owners they have options'.

Their research found that Australians with a mortgage of at least $489,300 will cost $1 million over the life of a 30-year loan, using the average variable interest rate of about 5.5 per cent.

An Australian mortgage of less than $500,000 will actually set you back more than $1 million by the time it's paid

Michelle Hutchison, Money Expert with finder.com.au, told Daily Mail Australia that the hefty price tag 'is not meant to put people off but show home-owners they have options'

Sydney tops the list for the most expensive median house price of $825,000  and for this price tag, borrowers will hit the $1 million mark by year 11

If this mortgage size was 80 per cent of the property's value, that means any property priced from $611,625 will end up costing borrowers $1 million.

Ms Hutchison, said many borrowers are being stung by this slow-burning hole in their hip pocket but it doesn't have to be that way.

'The fact is that there is such a huge difference in what lenders are offering, there's thousands of types of loans out there and different interest rates,' she said. 

'When borrowers look at how much they can afford to repay for a home loan, they might not look down the track to how much they end up spending. The danger lies with spending a lot more than necessary.

Sydney: $825,000 ($1.349 million)

Melbourne: $633,000 ($1.035 million)

Perth: $530,000 ($866,673)

Brisbane: $475,000 ($776,735)

Adelaide: $421,000 ($688,433)

'While it’s likely that your home will increase in value over a 30-year loan term, it might not compensate the cost of a home loan as the money you end up spending can be greatly increased if you have a small deposit and don’t shop around for a good value deal,' she said.

Her other big tip is to pay that little bit extra each month or every week.

'Just $50 a month on a $489,300 loan can make a huge difference and will save you $26,000 over time,' she said.  

Ms Hutchison added that an extra $50 a week on the mortgage can trim almost $100,000 by the end. She also urged borrowers to haggle.

'Review your home loan very year, just by arguing with your current lender and getting 10 basis points trimmed, can work,' she added.

'And keep on top of your mortgage, if you get a reduction, make sure it doesn't get absorbed when rates fall.

'There are plenty of options and the lenders know that, so threaten to leave in the nicest possible way - the lenders are clever and know their competition, so use that leverage as a bargaining tool.' 

'The fact is that there is such a huge difference in what lenders are offering, there's thousands of types of loans out there and different interest rates,' Michelle Hutchison said

Finder states that: 'Across the country, Sydney tops the list for the most expensive median house price of $825,000 according to figures by CoreLogic RP Data. For this price tag, borrowers will hit the $1 million mark by year 11, based on the average variable rate of about 5.5 percent, with a 20 percent deposit which would mean a loan size of $660,000.'

For the median-priced house in Melbourne of $633,000, a mortgage of $506,400 (with a 20 per cent deposit) would cost borrowers $1.035 million over 30 years, hitting the $1 million mark by year 24.

'This research was based on the average variable rate of about 5.5 per cent but borrowers need to remember that there’s a big difference between what lenders are offering, which can mean bigger costs for a home if you’re not careful,' she added.
