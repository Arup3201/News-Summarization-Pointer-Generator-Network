The idea of heading deep into the desert to camp under the stars has been given the ultimate upgrade by one company in Oman.

Forget sleeping in cramped tents and eating food cooked on a gas stove, Hud Hud Travels 

Many guests visit the far-flung Arabian Peninsula to experience the capital city of Muscat, but Hud Hud Travels offers an opportunity to sample a taste of rural Oman.. without sacrificing any of life's little luxuries.

With options to customise an already-developed itinerary or design a completely bespoke holiday from start to finish, guides will tailor the days and nights of your safari specifically to suit your interests.

Whether you prefer to shop in the souks, visit an ancient village, or swim in a water-filled ravine, known as a wadi, Hud Hud offers an adventure through northern Oman like no other.

Is this the most luxurious desert camp in the world? African style tents are set up in the Wahiba Desert

Working closely with the guides, guests can customise a five-to-seven day itinerary suited to their interests

First time visitors, however, may prefer to stick to Hud Hud's suggested five or seven day schedules, which includes at least one night in the Wahiba Desert and one in the Hajar Mountains.

Since all of the camps are entirely private and mobile, Hud Hud can camp almost anywhere in Oman, literally making the entire country your playground. 

'We love to develop very special itineraries that add in different modes of transport and different activities,' says a spokesperson for Hud Hud. 

For example, in the past, Hud Hud has organised such events a village-wide Arabian horse show - for just two guests - and even a catered sushi dinner in the middle of the desert.

Hud Hud also organises stunning, yet remote special events - like a sushi dinner in the middle of the desert 

While camping in Wahiba Sands, guests stay in traditional Bedouin tents, complete with beds and mattresses

Relax and enjoy a book - with stunning sand dune views - with your significant other

Tents are also outfitted with cotton bedding, Arabian rugs and throws, and other elegant furnishings

Despite all the high-end luxuries, there is no electric light - instead, there's an emphasis on preserving the natural atmosphere using only candles, oil lamps, and fires

In the Wahiba Sands, guests will sleep in authentic, handmade Bedouin tents - complete with large beds and real mattresses, cotton bedding, Arabian rugs and throws and elegant furnishings.

However, there is no electric light. Instead, there is an emphasis on preserving the natural atmosphere using only candles, oil lamps and fires.

After enjoying the desert, guests can also take day trips within the Sharqiya Region and experience traditional villages, old forts, castles and tombs. There are also several 'wadis' and canyons in the area for swimming, but the real attraction is the region's famous camel racing.

Day trips in the Sharqiya Region are also possible. Pictured: an elegant set-up in Oman's Empty Quarter, an area of over 250,000 square miles of dunes 

All basic itineraries also include time spent in the Hajar Mountains to allow travellers to experience two completely different sides of the country

All  Hajar Mountain camps are set up at 1,000 m elevation with views of Oman's highest peak: Jebel Shams

By contrast, in the days and nights spent in the Hajar Mountains, travellers will have the opportunity to experience a completely opposite part of Oman.

The camps are set up at 1,000 m, in complete privacy, with stunning views of Oman's highest peak: Jebel Shams. 

And there are activities for all interests. For those excited about geology, for example, Hud Hud can arrange for specialists to come in to speak to you about the area. Or simply wander the traditional mountain villages and chat with locals about their lifestyle.

The camp is also within easy reach of both Nizwa and Bahla, close to one of Oman's greatest off road drives, as well as accessible to date plantations and Nizwa's famous souk. 

Longer trips can also include time spent camping along the coast. Pictured: the Khalouf Beach

Whether near Bar al Hickmann or Khalouf, families and couples can take advantage of the stunning Indian Ocean views

A dune-top lunch table can also be set up to offer guests a truly unique view of the ocean below

An outdoor, beach-front living space is likewise constructed for guests spending time in the coastal region

In this relatively remote area, about five hours south of Muscat, tourists can meet local fisherman and experience the wildlife - namely, flamingoes

Though stunning during the day, it's at night that the real show begins: a night-sky completely lit with stars

Hud Hud is also happy to provide a custom adventure or mode of transport - such as a chartered boat

Ocean lovers can opt for a longer stay to experience the sandy beauty of Khalouf Beach and take dip in the Indian Ocean. 

Located about five hours south of Muscat, tourists rarely reach the stunning remote area, where guests can explore sand dunes, meet local fisherman, and spend time with the flamingoes native to the area. 

No matter where you decide to set up camp, however, it is the night sky that is the true show-stopper - the sparkling constellations made visible in these remote areas will impress even the most experienced of astronomers.

Rates very depending on group size, duration, and location, however, a fully inclusive tour and camping - all of which is private - starts at about £684 per person per night. This would cover the Hajar Mountains, Wahiba Sands and also trips to the coast near Bar al Hickmann and Khalouf Beach.

If you opt to venture south to Dhofar, or an alternate location of choice, prices generally start at £805 per person per night.

It's also worth noting that alcohol is not permitted to be provided, but guests may bring it with them.
