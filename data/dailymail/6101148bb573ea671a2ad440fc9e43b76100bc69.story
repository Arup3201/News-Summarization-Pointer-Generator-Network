On the move? Tottenham target Memphis Depay has hinted he would consider a transfer away from PSV

Depay scored two goals in four appearances at this summer's showpiece, with Spurs maintaining an interest in the Dutch flyer after missing out on France international Antoine Griezmann to La Liga champions Atletico Madrid.

Depay is back in training with PSV but admitted that may not be for too much longer if a big club came calling.

'I did my time at PSV but if nice clubs from big leagues ask, of course I will think about it,' he told the Sun.

'There is lots of interest but it is an easy option to stay.

'I understand that fans want me to play well this season in Eindhoven, but ultimately I'm the one who decides how my career will look and no one else.'
