'Bias': Lord Gus O'Donnell, former head of the Civil Service, criticised ministers

The peer who was once the most powerful civil servant in Britain has laid into ministers for their ‘ludicrous bias’ in favour of elderly people.

Sir Gus O’Donnell has also criticised their determination to bring down immigration.

In an outspoken article, he said that continuing to let the young subsidise the old was ‘bad economics and bad social policy’ – but governments were afraid to upset pensioners as they were more likely to vote.

The former Cabinet Secretary, who served three prime ministers from 2005 to 2011, questioned whether it was right that the elderly get free bus passes and prescriptions while public finances were so tight.

Writing in The Political Quarterly, Lord O’Donnell also warned that the UK will be in the ‘global slow lane for years to come’ and that its productivity performance was ‘far from stellar’.

‘The government’s determination to bring down net migration may lower future potential output,’ he said. In a wide-ranging article about how to achieve a ‘better politics for a better Britain’, the peer said radical change was needed as the country was in a ‘bad place’.

He also suggested politicians should not be able to stand as an MP unless they met certain ‘pre-qualification criteria’. And he controversially called on all new government policies to be overseen by an independent body made up of ex-ministers and civil servants – called the Office for Taxpayer Responsibility.

As Cabinet Secretary, Lord O'Donnell was seen as being so powerful in Whitehall that he was nicknamed ‘GOD’. 

A year after retiring to the Lords, he has now written that public spending needs to reined in because ‘the rising trend in obesity, the growth of dementia and Alzheimer’s and mental health issues in general make it hard to see how the state can afford to help all who need it’.

Part of the problem, he said, was that ministers are too wary of powerful lobby groups who mobilise to prevent any effort to cut their benefits.

‘One obvious example is the plethora of special payments and perks given to the over-60s like free bus passes or prescriptions,’ he said.

'Should all over-60s get free prescriptions?' questions Lord O'Donnell. He says part of the problem was ministers are too wary of powerful lobby groups

‘Should all over-60s get free prescriptions? Why are we paying winter fuel allowances to millionaire pensioners on the Costa Brava?

‘This is all part of the ludicrous bias whereby the old are subsidised by the young. It is bad economics and bad social policy. Unfortunately it has been judged to be good politics as the old have a higher propensity to vote.’

'The public are being faced with a choice 
between a free, but second rate, public service following the cutbacks; 
and an expensive, but very customer-focused private sector’

- Lord O'Donnell

Lord O'Donnell said the failure to control costs meant that in ever more areas, ‘the public are being faced with a choice between a free, but second rate, public service following the cutbacks; and an expensive, but very customer-focused private sector’.

He said the NHS was ‘expensive and inefficient’, and claimed the education system does not produce the skills that businesses need.

Lord O’Donnell also called on MPs to receive training to prepare them for jobs as ministers.

But he did not spell out what criteria he thought candidates for Parliament should meet as part of his ‘pre-qualification criteria’.

However, a spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: ‘At present they undergo rigorous scrutiny by the electorate. It’s called democracy.’
