Daniel Ricciardo still has designs on this year's Formula One world title, although appreciates his hopes are now 'distant'.

Back-to-back victories either side of the summer break, as he took advantage of Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg tripping over themselves, had propelled Ricciardo into contention.

But around the lightning-fast, low-downforce Monza circuit in Italy earlier this month that played to Mercedes' strengths, Ricciardo and Red Bull were found wanting.

An abysmal start did not help, and despite several stunning overtaking moves, Ricciardo finished fifth behind a Mercedes one-two spearheaded by Hamilton.

Ahead of Sunday's grand prix under the lights in Singapore, Ricciardo trails Rosberg by 72 points and Hamilton by 50, but whilst there remains an opportunity, he will not be throwing in the towel.

'Ideally if we could head to Abu Dhabi (the final race where double points are on offer) within 50 points and have a chance then I think that will be a huge achievement no matter what happens,' said Ricciardo.

'To even just get to the last race and still be in with a shot would be awesome, which is the aim, but the approach is still race-by-race.

'I'm aware the title is distant, but we've some tracks now that suit us, and I've won some races this year so I know if I get in that position I've got a good chance of doing it again.

'All it takes is a couple of wins and a couple of bad races for the championship leader and all of a sudden everything's possible again, so let's see what happens.'

Ricciardo has conceded patience will need to be his main ally this weekend at arguably the most demanding venue of the season.

'When you walk around on Thursday the surface always looks pretty dirty,' said the Australian of the Marina Bay Street Circuit.

'Modern street races like this tend to wash and scrub the track, but even that doesn't really change the fact that what you're driving on is a public road with all the grit, grime and dirt that those have.

'It means you're in for a slithery, bumpy weekend - which I love!

'The important thing in Singapore is to not get caught chasing the set-up on a Friday.

'The track is going to evolve, so you've just got to be patient and let it happen without constantly tweaking your car, trying to hit a moving target.

'It's one of those races where you're never completely satisfied with the amount of preparation you do.'
