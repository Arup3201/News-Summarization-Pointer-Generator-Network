The health effects of what is described as 'the symbol of a bad diet' are to be examined by scientists in Glasgow.

The deep-fried mars bar has long been a staple of the Scottish chip shop menu board.

But despite its reputation as the ultimate unhealthy snack, no research has ever been done to investigate how it affects the body.

The symbol of a bad halth: Deep-fried Mars bars have been said to represent the 'high-fat, high'sugar' diet of so many Scots

Students at The University of Glasgow are keen to find out, and have launched a project which compares the effects the bizarre delicacy has on blood vessels to those of porridge, another national favourite.

Leading the study is Professor Matthew Walters, the head consultant for stroke at the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, and the director of the Scottish Stroke Research Network.

He said: 'In this student project we will look at what happens to blood vessels in the brain and compare the effects of fried chocolate with another traditional Scottish delicacy, porridge.'

Porridge has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in the past, while eating chocolate has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke.

But the effect of either food on blood flow to the brain has never been examined.

The study will include 24 volunteers under the age of 40 with a BMI between 18 and 30 who will eat the porridge or deep-fried mars bars regularly. 

They are then required to attend the hospital twice for 90 minutes at a time, where their blood flow will be monitored by ultrasound technology.

The deep-fried delicacy has been a Scottish favourite since it first appeared in Aberdeenshire in the 1990s. Since then chippies across the country have received off requests for deep-fried treats such as ice-cream and bananas

William Dunn, a student at The University of Glasgow who will perform the scans told the Independent: 'We hope the results will shed more light on the links between diet and stroke and allow health-conscious Glaswegians to make a more informed choice in the chip shop.'

It's thought the deep fried mars bar first appeared in Aberdeen in 1995, but soon became a Glasgow favourite. A 2004 survey found that 22 per cent of fish and chip shops in the city sold the snack.

The trend has continued with chippies hearing requests for other deep-fried goods such as Snickers bars, bananas, Creme Eggs and even ice-cream.
