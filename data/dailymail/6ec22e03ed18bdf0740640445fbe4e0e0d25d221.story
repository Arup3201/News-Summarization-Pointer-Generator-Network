They were meant to be among the finishing touches designed to make a new hotel look more appealing to customers.

But instead, attempts to brighten up the area around a new Premier Inn hotel in Woking with carefully groomed plants have left locals 'in stitches'.

The phallic-looking topiary sandwiched between two spherical bay trees raised a few eyebrows among local residents and workers who pointed out that they looked like erect penises.

One amused Woking resident, who sent pictures of the plants to the GetSurrey website, said: 'The bushes recently installed at Premier Inn's new building in Woking on Church Street West... has us all in stitches.'

The unusual foliage also caused a bit of a stir on Twitter, with most seeing the funny side.

Janet Mozelewski posted : 'The landscape gardener clearly had a wicked sense of humour.'

But some were more concerned about declining standards of British topiary.

Louise Morales added: 'There used to be a time when #topiary took a little skill, so is this the state of #horticulture in the UK?'

But when the embarrassing issue was raised with Premier Inn staff, the bushes were given a trim.

Although part of the plants remains, the spherical trees at its base have since been given the snip and have been removed by workmen.

A spokesperson for the hotel chain said: 'It turns out the plants were actually not part of Premier Inn at all but were owned by the developers, so [they] were not our responsibility and they have now moved them.

'We cannot comment on this as they were not ours.'
