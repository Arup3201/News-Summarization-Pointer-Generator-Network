A woman has told of her horror at being left deformed and battling life-threatening injuries after a plastic surgeon injected fillers into her face that went disastrously wrong.

Alex Laird, 53, from Ireland, bought the Bio-Alcamid filler treatment from a London surgeon eight years ago after seeing an advert online.

But a few years later, the chemicals started to move around her face, leaving her with unsightly bumps that quickly became severely infected.

Alex Laird, 53, from Ireland, had Bio-Alcamid fillers injected into her face. Years later, the chemicals moved around, causing disfigurement and infections. She is sharing her story as a warning 

Alex, who works as an accounts administrator, had to be hospitalised twice because the infections were so critical. 

She has since had the fillers removed by another surgeon and is on the road to recovery, but shared her story on Channel 5's Botched Up Bodies this evening to warn others to do proper research before booking cosmetic procedures.

Alex initially bought cheek implants in the 1980s,  in order to make her face look less miserable.  

She said: 'I used to get complete strangers coming up to me saying "Oh cheer up", "You look so miserable", "It's never going to happen".

'I used to look at people who had lovely big cheekbones and I wanted that. I didn't want to look sad anymore.

'I went to the UK to a particular surgeon. I knew nothing about him or the procedure, I just said I wanted cheek implants in my face.'

Alex started cosmtetic surgery in the 1980s when she saw an article in a magazine for cheek implants 

Initially, Alex was delighted with the results, but the effect didn't last long. 

She said: 'After about two months the implants went down to the size of little teaspoons - you could clearly see the outline.'

As time went on, she became increasingly unhappy about her appearance again and turned to the internet for a solution.

She said: 'When I read about this permanent filler I thought, "I'm going to get this done. This is finally the answer I've been looking for."'

Alex's family and friends told her that was being ridiculous, but her mind was made up and she flew to London to meet with a surgeon that she found on the internet who said he could do Bio-Alcamid fillers. 

She said: 'He said to me the filler was completely safe, there were no problems with it, he'd even put some in his own wife.

'He put it all down my jaw, in my cheeks, around my eyes and in my temple area.

'My friends and family were quite shocked at the way I looked, (but) I was really pleased with the results.'

Alex used to look at people who had 'lovely big cheekbones' and want them. She didn't want to 'look sad'

However, Alex's happiness was not to last. 

The filler that had once given her confidence and self-assurance started to swell and migrate around her face.

With her face now completely deformed, she sought out a doctor in Ireland.

She said: 'I'll never forget the look on his face. The first thing he said to me was, "Did you sue whoever did this to you?" 

Now desperate, Alex returned to the surgeon in London who immediately agreed that she needed some of the fillers removed.

She said: 'He squeezed some (of it) out, mainly around my temple area, and I remember thinking that it was like a ticking time bomb in my face.'

That time bomb was about to explode - with devastating consequences. 

Soon afterwards, Alex was rushed to hospital with a swollen face from  severe infection.

She said: 'I felt overwhelmed with fear.'

In a bid to get her botched face fixed, Alex paid a visit to cranial facial surgeon Niall Kirkpatrick, in London.

He examined her face and felt for potential danger zones

Although she wanted most of the filler gone, Alex was desperate to be able keep her cheek implants because she was scared that she would be 'left with nothing' if they were removed.

The surgeon then booked her in for an MRI scan to help determine exactly where the Bio-Alcamid is, so he could work out how to remove it.

Alex left Niall's office pleased she was heading in the right direction, however, just three days later she was rushed to hospital with another life-threatening infection caused by the filler.

The filler that had once given her confidence and self-assurance had started to swell and migrate

Now that the filler is all removed, Alex says she feels much less anxious

It was even more severe than her previous infection and she was put on an intravenous drip of antibiotics. 

This time, it took seven days to bring the bacteria-infected filler that was distorting her face under control. 

The cosmetic industry's biggest money spinners include laser hair removal, Botox,  fillers. 

It is an area which is almost entirely unregulated.

There are hundreds of fillers available, including Restylane, Juvederm, Radiesse, Sculptra, Bio-Alcamid and Macrolane to name just a few.

Bio-Alcamid, a permanent skin filler, was made for the medical industry to replace tissue lost by people suffering from wasting conditions or who have had large tumours removed. 

It has since been taken up by cosmetic surgeries as a way to plump up the skin. 

As the name suggests, once a permanent filler is injected, they remain in the body forever.

If they move, patients can be left with unsightly lumps or bumps which are difficult to remove.

Bad reactions to fillers can cause facial necrosis, disfigurement, nerve damage and anaphylactic shock.

Alex said: 'The fact it was happening twice - I never expected that. 

'I really didn't expect to get another infection so soon and I think it was actually more scary.'

With her health at such risk, it became crucial that the filler was removed before another infection struck. 

She came back to London to see surgeon Niall for the results of her MRI scan.

The news wasn't good - Alex had two implants in each cheek - one on top of the other - and unfortunately they were surrounded by Bio-Alcamid filler, meaning they would have to be removed along with the liquid.

To compensate, Niall suggested a mid-facelift to help counter any sagging that might occur once everything was removed.

Now that the filler is all removed Alex says she feels much less anxious - although she is still concerned about the swelling around her eyes.

Surgeon Niall has assured assured her that the healing process can take up to six months though, and that she should be patient.

She said: 'I do think I made a mistake all those years ago - definitely - having that stuff put in my face. 

'I think permanent filler equals permanent problems. I would never advise anyone to have it done.'
