A 12-year-old boy tried to re-enact scenes from a porn film he watched in school on the internet by raping his younger sister, a court heard.

The schoolboy searched for the hardcore films with a classmate - before going home to copy what he had seen.

The boy admitted three charges of rape when he appeared before Newport Crown Court yesterday.

Judge Thomas Crowther QC said: 'It’s a sad fact that many boys of his age will have been exposed to adult pornography.

'But not all boys exposed to it will act as he did. He found pornography online and replicated what he saw.

'Let us remind ourselves that the internet is not a benign babysitter but a mirror of adulthood in all its forms.'

The slightly built boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, sat between his parents as he was sentenced.

The court heard the brother and sister regularly shared a bedroom while staying with a family member.

Their parents discovered what was going on when the girl, who was under the age of 10, confided to a relative that her brother had touched her.

The boy was questioned by another family member and admitted having urges he could not control and knew what he was doing was wrong.

The court heard the sexual abuse had been going on for a year.

The boy was given a three-year youth rehabilitation order and will continue to live at the family home.

He was ordered to register as a sex offender for two-and-a-half years.

The boy’s school was not named but education chiefs are investigating how the 12-year-old accessed pornography while in school.
