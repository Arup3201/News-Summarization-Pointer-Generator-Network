Forget Groundhog Day. For suffering Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw, it is beginning to feel more like Groundhog Year.

There has been an increasingly familiar pattern to his addresses in the aftermath of every one of his team’s four defeats in this Six Nations campaign so far. He has talked of the positives to take from each loss while trying his best to put the bravest of faces on matters.

As he sat at BT Murrayfield on Tuesday following a tough training session with his international colleagues, his mask didn’t slip one bit as he went through the same old routine.

But behind the forced smile it was clear there is a new fear engulfing him which makes the final Six Nations match against Ireland on Saturday an increasingly nervous prospect.

The scrum-half with 38 caps to his name doesn’t want to join Chris Paterson and Ross Ford in the record books as a captain who led Scotland to a Six Nations wooden spoon. Paterson did it twice, in 2004 and 2007, with Ford suffering a similar fate in 2012.

Since Five Nations became Six, Italy have been bottom of the pile 10 times with Wales and France finishing last once each. England and Ireland have never picked up the wooden spoon.

Laidlaw, who played stand-off rather than scrum-half in the side that was whitewashed under Ford, doesn’t want to experience that feeling again. He is hoping his team-mates feel as embarrassed as he is about the current plight and use the fear of failure as motivation to put things right against the Irish.

‘I don’t know if it hurts me as captain more than the other players, but losing all our games so far certainly hurts me a lot, that’s for sure,’ said the 29-year-old. ‘I like to think avoiding the wooden spoon is a big driving factor whether you are captain or not, as nobody wants to be in the team that’s failed to pick up any wins.

‘Remember, though, we haven’t finished bottom yet and we’ve got an opportunity this weekend to finish on a high. If we can win this one, it allows us to give a big sigh of relief going into the pre-World Cup games over the summer and then build towards the World Cup.

‘The other side of the coin is that if we lose this one, it’s a long time before we play for Scotland again and that’s the worst situation to be in. At least we have a week to try to rectify some of the problems that were there against England and give everybody the boost they want by turning things around against Ireland.’

Laidlaw admitted he has been left totally frustrated at how his side had come up short in all their matches and fallen away badly in the second half of key games.

Although he believes all is not lost, he is clearly growing tired of constantly being the one trying to explain away in public what is going wrong.

‘I’ve almost been saying the same things most weeks, unfortunately,’ he continued. ‘I still believe there are huge positives in there and I think everybody, including ourselves, can see some of the play is brilliant and the players get confidence from that.

‘I know the English boys and the Welsh boys, in particular, think that we’re now a threat and a much better team than we were in the past despite the defeats. We are getting close to winning but need to do that little bit extra to get over the line.

‘Of course there are things to look at and, for instance, we’re getting to half-time in good positions but maybe dropping off slightly, which is something we need to sort.

‘Looking back at the England game, that is what happened as there wasn’t enough urgency in the early part of the second half and we just let England come at us. There’s only so much you can soak up before cracking and we can’t let that happen again.’

Murrayfield will have a capacity attendance for the match against Ireland, with many visiting fans making up the 67,000 crowd. Irish supporters had bought their tickets within hours of them going on sale on the assumption their team would be challenging for the Grand Slam.

A clean sweep is no longer a possibility after their defeat to Wales last weekend but, even with tens of thousands inside the stadium cheering on Joe Schmidt’s title contenders, Laidlaw still believes the Scotland players can be inspired by the atmosphere within Murrayfield.

‘We want to win for the jersey, win for ourselves, win for the fans, because they’ve been brilliant throughout a tough campaign,’ he said.

‘We can feed off them hugely and want to go out there and give them something back for their continued support. We really want to send them off on a good note, because it’s been a tough championship for the players and fans alike.’

A win over Ireland would indeed have the fans singing a happier tune. For that to happen, Ford insists there is nothing to be gained from dwelling too much on the results which have brought Scotland to this precarious position.

‘We need to be realistic, look at where we aren’t good enough and try to improve,’ said the Edinburgh hooker, capped 84 times. ‘We need to stay positive going into the games and it is a huge positive to know we have pushed good teams close and scored tries against them.

‘There is no point getting down as it doesn’t get you anywhere on the pitch. It’s about staying positive and getting right back out and going after Ireland.

‘It would be great to finish the campaign on a high, especially at home. It is a World Cup year, so it would be a very positive note to end the Six Nations on.’
