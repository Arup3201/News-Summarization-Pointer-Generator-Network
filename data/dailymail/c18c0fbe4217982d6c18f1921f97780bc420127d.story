They were the 18th century equivalent of a glitzy night out at the Chiltern Firehouse, beloved by the great, the good and the royal.

But while today's society parties are fuelled by nothing more than alcohol, Georgian 'Pleasure Gardens' were decidedly risqué - to say the least.

Now the Georgian love of public fancy dress promenades is the focus of a display at the Museum of London, with beautiful colour plates revealing a glamorous - and seedy - side of 18th century life.

Pleasure Gardens were large areas of land made for lavish entertainment, which first became popular following the Restoration in 1660 and remained so until well into the 19th century.

Fringed by elaborate colonnades, the elaborate public spaces, most of which were in London, were a place to see and be seen and the location for everything from balls to public breakfasts, fireworks displays and, most infamous of all, masquerade balls. 

'The popularity of fancy dress seems to coincide with periods when the structures of society are very rigid, to provide a relief from strict hierarchies,' explains curator Beatrice Behlen.

'But masquerades are also popular in times when society is in flux or our notions of gender are changing.  

Illicit: Walks like those seen in this 1750 depiction of Ranelagh Gardens were seen as hotbeds of illicit romance

Risque: The costumes worn by revellers, in particularly the female ones, tended to be revealing

Fan: As Prince of Wales, the future George IV adored attending masked balls and masquerades

'The latter was probably the case in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the rise of the middle classes and their different perception of the role of men and women.'

At the balls, revellers, among them the future George IV, would dress up in a variety of revealing outfits and dance the night away - often going home with partners who weren't their spouses.

Unsurprisingly, the antics of Pleasure Garden revellers led to outrage in some quarters, with many commentators pointing to disguise as a means of indulging in all kinds of debauchery without being recognised.

And they weren't entirely wrong. One of the most scandalous events of the 18th century took place at the Ranelagh May Ball of 1749.

Elizabeth Chudleigh (later the Duchess of Kingston), appeared as the tragic Iphigenia of ancient Greek mythology, undressed for sacrifice, in a costume so transparent she appeared almost naked.

Chudleigh certainly wasn't the only one. According to Behlen, women often used masquerade balls as a means of dispensing with the restrictive fashions of the day, replacing them with ensembles that were both more comfortable and less concealing.

As a result, milkmaid styles with their shorter skirts and low bodices became hugely popular as did sweeping Turkish styles, including harem pants.

'Masquerades allowed trying out different roles but also, on a more prosaic level, gave licence for wearing more revealing clothes,' explains Behlen.

'Popular ‘characters’ were shepherdesses and milkmaids which allowed wearing shorter skirts, revealing some leg. 

'Costumes inspired by Turkish dress, involving the use of trousers, were also popular. And apparently some women event went as far as dressing as men.'

Worse still, in the moralist's eyes, were the many dark nooks within the gardens, all of which - whether mazes or shaded walks - lent themselves to secret romances and extracurricular liaisons.

Particularly notorious was Vauxhall Gardens’ Dark Walk. 'The most experienced mothers have often lost themselves in looking for their daughters,' noted society commentator Tom Brown of the walkway in 1700’

The gardens were known to be rife with prostitution, while Samuel Pepys mentions in his diaries ‘young gallants misbehaving and insulting the ladies’. 

Drunken nights fuelled gossip and excitement that was widely reported in newspapers and periodicals.

'The Pleasure Gardens were said to be swarming with prostitutes and while in 1766 "pickpockets, sharpers, and common prostitutes" were indeed caught executing "the respective branches of their trades", sometimes one wonders whether the talk of loose woman was a marketing ploy by the owner of Vauxhall,' says Behlen.

But while the many prostitutes fuelled scandal, what was even worse in society's eyes was the idea of different classes mixing. 

'The owners of the Pleasure Gardens were aware of the confusion that masquerade outfits could bring and usually were strict in not allowing any actual masks to be worn,' explains Belen.

'What was most feared was a mingling of the different strata of society and on one occasion one journalist remarked that "several of the music", had mixed with the rest of the company - a sign of "rudeness and impropriety of conduct".'
