A fashion student who spoke out against the industry's obsession for stick-thin women has landed a job - as a sexy super-sized underwear model.

Lotte Williams, 22, has spent three years working in the fashion industry surrounded by size-zero models as part of her degree course.

She regularly undertook assignments working in PR, journalism and event management as part of her studies at London's College of Fashion.

Lotte Williams beat 700 entries from other members of the public to win a year-long modelling contract

Lotte looks stunning in her modelling photos, saying she was fed up with the image portrayed by the fashion industry of ultra thin girls

But despite the pressure copy the shapeless models that grace the catwalks of London and Paris Lotte says she was always proud to be different to the other girls.

And now she is enjoying life as the new face of fuller figured lingerie firm Curvy Kate after winning their annual 'Star in a Bra' competition.

The size 12 redhead - who wears a 30GG bra - has revealed that she was inspired to enter the contest to stand up for fuller-figured ladies.Â 

Lotte, from Colchester, Essex, said: 'As part of my course I've been around these size-zero women at London Fashion Week on numerous occasions and I've never thought they really represent real women.

'I thought fuller-figured women such as myself represent the norm much more than the women that grace the catwalks.

Lotte felt confident stripping down for the shoot and says working in fashion hasn't dented her confidence

Lotte says that being curvy in the fashion industry encouraged her to develop her own sense of style that flattered her hourglass figure

'I was fed up by the image that was being portrayed to young girls - that this is the way you should look.

'The likes of Curvy Kate really dispel this myth and there are loads of beautiful curvier women as this year's competition showed.

'I think they are much more representative of the general British public

'I was just so happy to win it with so much amazing competition. In my eyes this is what women really look like.

'Being part of a world in which size six is the norm has never affected my self confidence but in turn has encouraged me to discover a sense of style that enhances my natural hour glass shape.'

Stunning Lotte - who works part-time in a lingerie boutique - beat 700 entries from other members of the public to win the year-long modelling contract earlier this month.

She will now grace the pages of Cosmopolitan magazine and the catwalks of Paris working as the new face of the lingerie company.

Size 12 Lotte, who wears a 30GG bra, says that her work in the lingerie boutique meant being in skimpy under wear was no problem for her

Lotte, who only finished her Fashion Public Relations course last week, added: 'I'm really looking forward to it - I work part-time in a lingerie boutique so I'm used to seeing lingerie models.

'This meant I was pretty comfortable wearing skimpy underwear and I think this confidence shone across in my pictures.

'But I never dreamed I would end up becoming a lingerie model - it's an amazing feeling.

Curvy Kate spokeswoman Hannah Houston said: 'Lotte is a fantastic ambassador for the brand and helps us prove just how good the curvy figure looks in lingerie.

Lotte says she was always proud to be different to the other girls

We are thrilled to have her as part of the Curvy Kate family as she is confident, charismatic and embodies our positive body image and diversity message.

'She also champions the fact that curvy is a shape not a size.

'Lotte shone in front of the camera and was so at ease in her lingerie and flaunting her curves.

'We know she'll thoroughly enjoy her year in the spotlight just as much as we will working with her."
