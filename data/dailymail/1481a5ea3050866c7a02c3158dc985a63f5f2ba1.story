Coping with a fear of flying might require counselling, therapy or even just getting aboard and gritting your teeth until you’re back on terra firma.

But pop down to a rather unremarkable industrial estate in Devon and you might be able to conquer your terrors for good.

At least that’s what former pilot Andy Wilkins, 56, says. He has recreated the interior of a Boeing 737-800 in one of the estate’s units to help fearful flyers.

Prepare for take off: Pilot Andy Wilkins has created a replica Boeing 737-800 to help people with flying phobias

The high-tech simulator is located in an industrial unit near Exeter in Devon

There’s a fully equipped cockpit and, 
behind it, a cabin with the familiar small windows, overhead lockers and
 seats with little leg room. The simulator also features announcements 
from the ‘crew’ and the sounds that terrify nervous flyers.

Mr
 Wilkins, who took redundancy after 20 years with Thomson Airways, 
counsels  clients and discusses the flying process with them. Clients 
then use the simulator to ‘fly’ the plane themselves.

Since
 launching the Virtual Jet Centre in Newton Abbot, he has already helped
 eight clients beat their fears. He said: ‘People have left saying that 
instead of feeling nervous about a flight they were excited.’

Mr
 Wilkins also offers pilot training, educational trips and corporate 
events at the unit. It costs £100 per hour for a three-hour Fear of 
Flying session.

One client 
was Emily Kaye, 38, who had to be prescribed Valium to fly. Since doing 
Mr Wilkins’s course she has been on holiday to Greece and didn’t need 
medication.

She said: ‘I became more afraid as I got older. But I felt 
100 per cent better after the course and was able to fly to Greece with 
no problems.’

At the end of the three-hour long course, the client will then have the opportunity to use the high-tech simulator to fly the plane themselves.

Since launching the Virtual Jet Centre in an industrial unit in Newton Abbot, Devon, four months ago, Andy has already helped eight people, including nervous flier Emily Kaye, 38, overcome their fears. 

Captain Wilkins has 30 years’ experience flying Airbus and Boeing passengers jets for a leading holiday airline. 

Take control: The course, which costs £100 per hours finishes with the chance to 'fly' the virtual aeroplane

He build the simulator at the Virtual Jet Centre to train pilots, offer flight experiences and corporate training days, as well as helping people overcome their fears of flight.

The father-of-one said: 'The fear of flying is all about loss of control. When you go on an aircraft it is the one time you have to sit there with total lack of control of everything.

'What we are doing is empowering people through knowledge.'
