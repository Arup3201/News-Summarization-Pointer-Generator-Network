Marcos Maidana has been rewarded for giving Floyd Mayweather Jnr his toughest test in years with a lucrative rematch against the pound-for-pound No 1.

Mayweather struggled to adapt to the Argentine's rough tactics when they first met in May, eventually grinding out a majority decision to preserve his unbeaten record.

The two welterweights will resume their rivalry on September 13, back at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Mayweather confirmed on Thursday.

The 37-year-old was short of options for his second fight of the year, with Amir Khan ruled out due to Ramadan while Manny Pacquiao is set to fight in Macau in October.

Mayweather said: 'Marcos Maidana is a tough customer and he gave me a fight that had me work for the victory.

'His
 style is difficult at best, but with experience comes a way and will to
 win. I'm not one to give second chances in the ring, but I want to give
 the fans what they want to see.

'I
 will be as prepared as I always am when I step in the ring on September
 13. I only see the outcome one way and that's another successful night 
for me and my team.'

The rematch will be promoted by Golden Boy, despite Mayweather saying he would not work with the company again after CEO Richard Schaefer departed last month.

Mayweather's own company, Mayweather Promotions, does not hold a license to host fights in Las Vegas.

Maidana
 said: 'The rematch with Mayweather is the only fight that really 
motivates me. I feel I earned it in the ring and Floyd owed it to me.

'I've already proved that I don't care if the man I have in front of me is the best pound-for-pound champion.

'I was close to ending his reign last time. On September 13 he will not get away undefeated.'
