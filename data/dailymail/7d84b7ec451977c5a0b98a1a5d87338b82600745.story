A professional footballer kicked a taxi driver in the head and set fire to his cab after taking party drug mephedrone or M-Cat.

Non-league player Oliver Edwards, 23, and Adam Wilson, 24, launched a vicious attack on 64-year-old driver Mohammed Sabir during an argument over a fare in Leek, Staffordshire.

Mr Sabir was left with severe swelling, 
bruising and grazing on his head, face and torso after Edwards and 
Wilson repeatedly stamped on him.

Brutal behaviour: Edwards, a winger for non-league side Leek Town FC, pictured, was jailed for four-and-a-half years

The pair then stole Mr Sabir’s Mitsubishi Lancer taxi and sped off before dumping the car in a country lane and setting it ablaze.

Edwards, a winger for Leek Town FC in Northern Premier League Division One South, was jailed for four-and-a-half 
years while Wilson was caged for four years after they admitted robbery 
at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday.

Sentencing them, Judge Robert Trevor-Jones told the pair: 'This was a most serious offence.

'You set about Mr Sabir in a brutal fashion, kicking and stamping on his head.

'You left him bleeding and semi-conscious in the road and effectively hijacked his taxi.

'You then, quite calculatingly, set fire to it, thinking you would destroy any forensic evidence to link you to the crime.'

Drug-fuelled assault: Edwards, who has now been fired from Leek Town FC, had taken M-Cat, or mephedrone

The court heard Edwards, who has convictions for unlawful wounding in 2005 and 2008, had been drinking with his then girlfriend Tiffany Garside, 26, and Wilson at the Quiet Woman pub in Leek on June 6 when they were picked up by Mr Tabir after closing time.

They asked to go to a nearby petrol station but when they arrived they argued with Mr Tabir over the fare.

David Bennett, prosecuting, said: 'When they arrived there was some kind of dispute.

'The three got out of the taxi and Mr Sabir drove away and parked 100 yards up the road.

'The three passengers entered the petrol station and alcohol was purchased. Mr Sabir had contacted his base and was told to stay there because the police had been called.

'While he was waiting he noticed the defendants approaching.

'Edwards opened the driver’s door and
pulled the complainant out of the taxi. He was attacked by Edwards and 
Wilson while he was on the ground.'

Edwards and Garside, both from Leek, then got into the Mitsubishi Lancer cab while Wilson drove it away.

Mr Bennett added: 'The complainant was left injured by the side of the road in a semi-conscious state.

'The taxi was only driven a short distance. It was abandoned in a country lane then set on fire. The £100 takings had been taken.'

The three were identified from CCTV footage taken at the petrol station and were arrested later that day.

Mother-of-one Garside, 26, admitted allowing herself to be carried in a vehicle taken without consent.

Nicholas Tatlow, defending, said: 'He [Edwards] had a good educational background, had excellent long-term employment prospects, and is a talented sportsman playing football at semi-professional level. He is appalled by what he has done.'

Andrew Molloy, defending Wilson, of Cheddleton, said his client had written a letter of apology Mr Sabir, adding: 'He is utterly ashamed.'

Garsidewas given a 12-month community order with 200 hours’ unpaid work.

After the attack, Edwards wrote a grovelling apology on his club’s website saying he had made a 'massive mistake.'

He has now been sacked from the team.
