Joshua Smith, 21, has been jailed for 32 months after he was caught on a home owner's CCTV burgling his house

A burglar covered his hands and feet to avoid leaving his prints at a crime scene but was still caught after the theft was captured on the homeowner's CCTV.

Joshua Smith, 21, has been jailed for 32 months after a police officer recognised him from footage of the break-in at a house in Ipswich, Suffolk.

A court heard how Smith had covered his footwear and hands before breaking in to the property through a conservatory window so that he wouldn't leave any prints.

But, unbeknown to him, the homeowner Jay Moore had equipped his house with hi-tech cameras which filmed Smith's every move.

When Mr Moore discovered the break-in on returning home he played back the footage - only to see Smith helping himself to a games station, cash, perfume and a mobile phone as well as other items.

Mr Moore reported the burglary to his local police station where an officer who had dealt with Smith in the past recognised the serial burglar from the CCTV footage.

Smith, of Ipswich, admitted burglary at Ipswich Crown Court and asked for two burglaries and three thefts to be considered.

Judge Rupert Overbury said he had an 'appalling criminal record' as he jailed him for 32 months.

The judge told Smith: 'You were caught because you were caught red-handed on CCTV and you were identified by a policeman who knew you.'

Craig Marchant, defending, said the intruder had tried to stay out of trouble but had returned to his old ways when he ran out of money.

Caught on camera: CCTV footage captured Smith walking through the property in Ipswich, Suffolk, and helping himself to valuables

Last night Mr Moore revealed how the CCTV shows Smith helping himself to valuables at his home -  and even stopping to go through his post.

He said: 'The CCTV shows him walking past the property then returning before coming through the conservatory, going into the kitchen and opening the back door.

'He starts picking things up and filling his bag. He goes upstairs in and out of bedrooms.'

He added: 'He is seen opening mail and checking the windows to see if anyone was going to disturb him. He then just goes walking up the drive and away.'

Mr Moore got home 10 minutes later - and was alerted by one of his two female lodgers.

'One of the girls had come home and said to me "I don~t know what's going on but I think we have been burgled".

'It's a horrible feeling actually watching someone burgle your home. It's a feeling of violation,' he said.

'The girls living in the house were very nervous after the burglary. One of the girls hasn't been sleeping properly.

'Even when they were in the house they would lock the door. It hit them a lot harder than it hit me and one has moved out since.'
