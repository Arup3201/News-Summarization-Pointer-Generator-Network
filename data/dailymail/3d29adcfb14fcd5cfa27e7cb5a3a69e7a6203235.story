Accused: Julia Bol, 28, was arrested for stabbing her friend in the cheek with a stiletto heel

A 28-year-old woman has been arrested for stabbing a woman in the cheek with a stiletto heel during an argument over a man they had both dated.

Julia Bol allegedly punctured 41-year-old Rebecca Boss' left cheek as they stood on a Nebraska sidewalk about 3am yesterday following a baby shower.

The pair were arguing before Bol reportedly grabbed one of Boss’ shoes, which she was holding in her hands, and 'stabbed her in the face with it'.

According to the police report, published by the Smoking Gun, Bol hit Boss with such force, the six-inch heel of the shoe 'had to be pulled out of her face.'

Bol then allegedly pushed Boss to the ground at the 1300 block of L Street, Lincoln, before choking and punching her.

Boss was taken to Bryan West Medical Center in Lincoln for neck bruising and a puncture wound, but was quickly released, according to The Inquisitr.

Bol reportedly received treatment for a minor injury to her arm, and was arrested on suspicion of assault and strangulation.

The police report claims the vicious brawl stemmed from Bol’s 'relationship with the father of the victim’s [Boss'] child'.

However KLIN.com
 reports police officer Katie Flood said the pair were arguing over a 
man they had both dated, and alcohol may have been a factor.

According to her Facebook page, Bol's hometown is Lincoln, Nebraska, but she currently lives in Woodland, California.
