Friday 13 didn't leave Mercedes red-faced as they dominated free practice at Formula One's season-opening Australian Grand Prix, but they did emit a crimson complexion of a different kind as they showed their support for Red Nose Day.

Last season's F1 World Constructors' Championship champions wore red noses in support for the British charity.

Defending World Champion Lewis Hamilton was the only one from the party to not be seen wearing a red nose, but the British racer did wear a T-shirt backing.

Captioned with the slogan 'I think I may be the voice of a generation,' the 30-year-old is all smiles as he poses for photographs with team-mate Nico Rosberg.

Rosberg was also pictured wearing a T-shirt, as well as a red nose, for the biennel telethon charity event which takes over the BBC on Friday evening.

And Friday's F1 practice proved a good one for the German as he set the fastest lap of 1:27.697secs in the second session on a glorious day at Albert Park, topping Hamilton by one tenth of a second.

Rosberg was also quickest in the first session, his best time of 1:29.557secs edging Hamilton as the constructors' champions carried their ominous form from winter testing onto the track.

Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel was third fastest on his debut for Ferrari in the second session, with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen fourth best.

The German made a flying start to his season as he topped the timesheets in both practice sessions

But with Vettel's fastest time over seven tenths of a second adrift of Rosberg, the opening day's practice will strengthen belief that the first rounds of the new season may be a private duel for race wins between the Mercedes duo.

At the other end of the grid, and dogged by reliability problems during winter testing, the gloom in the McLaren garage followed drivers Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen onto the track.

Magnussen, who has taken injured Fernando Alonso's seat at Albert Park, skidded into the gravel at turn six in the second session and his car had to be winched off the track.

That was after he and Button finished slowest of the 15 cars in the first session that posted flying laps. Button improved in the second but only marginally to be 13th fastest.
