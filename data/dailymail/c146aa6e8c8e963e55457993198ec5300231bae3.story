Anthony Joshua could be in line to fight David Haye next summer as promoter Eddie Hearn plots the Olympic heavyweight gold medallist's path to become a world champion.

Joshua heads the bill at this Saturday's Matchroom Boxing show at the O2 Arena in London when he looks to extend his unbeaten professional record to 9-0 in a WBC International title bout against Russian Denis Bakhtov.

The 24-year-old will then face veteran Michael Sprott in a British title eliminator on November 22 on the undercard of the Tony Bellew-Nathan Cleverly grudge match in Liverpool.

Hearn, a columnist for Sportsmail, has tipped the London 2012 hero to cruise through those fights and is already looking to 2015 where he expects Joshua to rip through his British rivals.

The winner of the eagerly-anticipated November 29 fight between Derek Chisora and Tyson Fury is on Hearn's agenda for Watford fighter Joshua, while a bout with 2008 Beijing Olympics bronze medallist David Price could also be on the cards.

Should Joshua come through convincingly, Hearn has revealed he would love to stage a summer showdown with former world heavyweight champion Haye.

'I would like to see him in with the Chisora-Fury winner and he will be 10-0 by then,' Hearn told ESPN's Nick Parkinson. 'If he's dealing with Bakhtov and Sprott inside two or three rounds, he's definitely ready for Chisora, Fury or Price next year.

'David Haye next summer might be a big fight as well if he's still fighting.

'They are all big fights but Anthony Joshua is going to be the money in the heavyweight division.'

Haye has not fought since his fifth-round knockout of Chisora at Upton Park in 2012.

But the popular Londoner, who faced the threat of retirement, is understood to be keen to return to the ring after a positive recuperation from shoulder surgery.

Joshua recently spent time in Austria sparring with Wladimir Klitschko before the injured world heavyweight champion's postponed fight against Kubrat Pulev.

As reported in Tuesday's Sports Agenda by Charles Sale, Klitschko, who famously defeat Haye in Hamburg for the WBA title three years ago, was 'surprised' by Joshua's tremendous speed and strength.

It will be no surprise to Hearn, however, should Joshua one day succeeds current king Klitschko as the best heavyweight on the planet.

Anthony Joshua is looking to follow in the footsteps of the legendary Lennox Lewis when he walks to the ring on Saturday.

Lewis sported the iconic 'FCUK' range ahead of his historic 1999 undisputed heavyweight coronation against Evander Holyfield.

And almost 15 years on from that memorable Las Vegas night, unbeaten Joshua picks up from Lewis as the revived brand's new ambassador.

Joshua's collection, as seen in these pictures, is available now at www.frenchconnection.com and at selected 'pop up shops' on Regent Street and Oxford Street, London.
