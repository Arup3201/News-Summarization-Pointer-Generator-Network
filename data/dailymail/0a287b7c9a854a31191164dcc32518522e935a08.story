The man's father, Michael Stewart, has said he doesn't believe foul play was involved and it may have been a suicide.

Michael Stewart said his son was despondent over a judge's recent refusal to hold a hearing on what the family believes was an illegally obtained search warrant.

Stewart was accused of killing strike force agent Jared Francom and wounding other officers when authorities descended on his Ogden home during a January 2012 raid. He could have faced the death penalty if convicted of aggravated murder.

Stewart also faced charges of attempted aggravated murder and marijuana cultivation stemming from the raid during which left the Francom dead, along with five other officers sustaining injuries ranging from serious to critical. Officer Francom was married with two young children.

Investigators said they received a telephone tip that Stewart was growing marijuana in his Ogden home about 40 miles north of Salt Lake City.

Officers have said they visited when no one was home and believed they could see equipment inside for growing marijuana.

Authorities obtained a search warrant, and a drug task force raided the site on January 4, 2012.

A total of 12 officers were 
present when the warrant was served.

Police
said Stewart had not responded to a knock at the door and waited for 
police to enter before firing into a hallway from his bedroom.

During the gun fight, Stewart suffered several gunshot wounds and was hospitalized for nearly a month.

Local resident Mat Weinberger told the Salt Lake Tribune that he initially thought gunshots he heard were fireworks.

With several police cars in sight of 
his porch and after hearing a police radio call that an officer was 
down, Weinberger said he realized there was shooting, estimating between
30 and 40 shots fired.

Serving
his first day in office on the day of the shooting, Ogden Mayor Mike 
Caldwell called the shooting a 'one-in-a-billion event'.
