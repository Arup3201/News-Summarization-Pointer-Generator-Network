Phil 'The Power' Taylor and Peter 'Snakebite' Wright were among those playing in the first round at the Ally Pally on Friday, and the Wealdstone Raider admitted he's a big fan of the darts.

'I ain't got no fans. I don't believe this. I haven't got no fans. I love darts. This is the first time I've actually been here live,' he told Sky Sports.

The Wealdstone Raider has big plans for Christmas, too, as he aims for a No 1 single come 2015.

'Have you bought my single? Buy my single please for charity!'
