Kenny MacAskill has said it will be 'for the people of Scotland to decide' if they want to keep the Queen as head of state if the country votes for independence

The Queen could be removed as head of state if Scotland votes for independence, a senior SNP minister has said.

Kenny MacAskill, the Scottish justice minister, said ‘it will be for the people of Scotland to decide’ if the country becomes a republic or remains a monarchy.

Alex Salmond’s official policy is that the monarchy would be automatically be retained if Scotland decides to secede - but many in his party are staunch republicans.

Mr MacAskill’s intervention in support of a referendum on becoming a republic at some point after independence is achieved further undermines the First Minister’s position.

A poll out this weekend shows the gap between the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ votes in the independence plebiscite has narrowed.

The survey, conducted by ICM Research, found that 39 per cent would vote ‘yes’ in the referendum - an increase of two percentage points on the previous month.

The percentage of ‘no’ votes fell from 49 in February to 46 per cent, leaving the proportion of ‘don’t knows’ at 15 per cent (down one percentage point on last month).

It means a swing of just five per cent could see the Union dissolved when the vote takes place on 18 September.

Mr Salmond’s strategy is to persuade people that not much would change if Scotland votes to leave the UK, from keeping the pound to retaining the Queen.

But Mr MacAskill’s comments, in response to question about whether Scotland should become a republic, have undermined that position.

At a public meeting last week, he reiterated the Scottish Government’s official position that ‘we will inherit the situation we have with the Queen as head of state in the ceremonial capacity that she has’.

The minister continued: ‘But it will be for the people of Scotland to decide. If and when that would occur, if they wished to have a referendum, and we would hope we would become the government post-2016, it will be for whoever is in office then.’

Official SNP policy for the last 50 years has always been to keep the Queen as head of state, and a spokesman said MacAskill 'totally backs that policy'

Until now, Mr MacAskill’s was most famous for his controversial decision to release the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi back to Libya on the basis that he was close to death with prostate cancer.

In fact, he lived on for another two years and nine months.

He is not the first pro-independence figure to support the abolition of the monarchy north of the border.

Aileen Campbell, the Scottish children’s minister, and Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish culture minister, have also called for a post-secession referendum on keeping the Queen.

Dennis Canavan, the campaign’s chairman, has said Prince George should never be King of Scots.

The Scottish Government said it had been SNP policy for 50 years to keep the monarchy in an independent Scotland.

‘Kenny MacAskill backs that policy totally,’ a spokesman said.

Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Tory deputy leader, said: ‘You have to wonder whether there is truly anyone in Yes Scotland’s leadership or the SNP, other than the First Minister, who is in tune with the Scottish public’s continuing affection and support for the monarchy.

‘There is surely little doubt that whatever promises and assertions are made before the referendum they would count for nothing if Scotland were to be seduced into voting Yes.

‘This motley alliance, including Kenny MacAskill, would then be doing all they could to pursue their minority republican views and it would be tiger whose tail even Alex Salmond would struggle to hold.’

The Scottish and English crowns were united in 1603 when Elizabeth I died without issue. She was replaced by the Scottish king James VI, who became King James I of England.

A century later, in 1707, the countries politically united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.

Last night an investment firm warned that an independent Scotland faces high debt and weak economic growth.

But BlackRock said fears of an exodus of banks amid nationalist anti-business sentiment were unlikely.

Its report concluded that independence ‘would bring major uncertainties, costs and risks - mostly for Scotland, but also for the remaining UK’.

A currency union looks ‘unfeasible’, leaving Scotland with the choice of joining the euro, which ‘does not appear to be a near term option’, or launching its own currency pegged to sterling or its other main trading partners and to the price of oil, it said.
