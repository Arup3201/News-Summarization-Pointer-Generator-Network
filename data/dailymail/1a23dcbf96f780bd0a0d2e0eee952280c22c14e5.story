He may be the oldest male member of the Royal Family but the Duke of Edinburgh looked a picture of health as he was spotted crunching through the autumn leaves yesterday.

The 93-year-old appeared sprightly as he took a 40-minute stroll around Windsor Great Park in Berkshire as he observed the Canada geese before making his way back to the castle.

Prince Philip is now the oldest and longest-serving spouse of any British monarch, after his marriage to the Queen in 1947.

The record for the longest-lived male descendant of Queen Victoria is currently held by Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg who lived to be 95 years, 6 months and 5 days old. 

This record could be surpassed by the prince on 15 December, 2016.

Despite suffering health scares recently the Duke seemed fit and healthy yesterday afternoon.

In June 2012, during his wife's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, he was taken to hospital with a bladder infection, which recurred in August while staying at Balmoral Castle. 

The following year he as admitted to the London Clinic for an exploratory operation on his abdomen and spent 11 days in hospital.

He also appeared earlier this year with a bandage on his hand after a 'minor procedure' was performed in Buckingham Palace.

He spent 40 minutes strolling around, taking in the wildlife and watching Canadian geese fly over his head

Over the years there have been some health scares for the 93-year-old including a recurring bladder infection

Despite the recent health cares, the monarch appeared a picture of health yesterday as he walked a private stretch of the 4,800 acre park. 

Its present area was determined in the 1360s and was popular with Saxon kings as a hunting forest and legend has it it's haunted by the ghost of Herne the Hunter.

Today the areas open to the public are often busy with visitors taking walks, picnics, bike rides and horse riding.
