Uber's CEO raised gasps at a conference by comparing his firm's problems with Las Vegas officials with the repression faced by demonstrators in Ferguson, it is claimed.

Travis Kalanick was speaking at a tech conference hosted by investment bank Goldman Sachs in the Nevada city, where his firm is embroiled in a battle with regulators.

As he spoke of the myriad problems faced by the young, rapidly growing start-up, Mr Kalanick then compared his problems in Las Vegas with those faced by anti-police brutality demonstrators in Ferguson, Pando Daily reports.

'Weird analogy: Uber CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick, who compared his company's problems with Las Vegas taxi regulators to the problems faced by people demonstrating against police brutality in Ferguson

Pando reporter Paul Carr says he was tipped off to the comments at the private conference by 'an extremely reliable source who ... asked that I didn't identify him or her.'

But it was quickly backed up by San Francisco based software engineer Tom Williams, who was at the conference and wrote on Twitter: 'Travis just compared Uber's Las Vegas regulatory problems with Ferguson. What a weird analogy.'

Prompted by Mr Carr to explain, Mr Williams added: 'He compared treatment of uber drivers in Las Vegas by authorities to what happened in Ferguson.'

Mr Kalanick's comments made the entire room gasp, Pando's anonymous source said.

It comes after Mr Kalanick was forced into damage control mode last week after an Uber executive's suggestion to dig up dirt on reporters who write critically of the car-sharing service.

But the very next day Uber was forced to confirm it was investigating whether one of its general managers violated its own privacy policies by snooping on a reporter's ride.

The probe stems from allegations that Josh Mohrer, general manager of Uber's New York office, used a company tracking tool called 'God View' to monitor the location of a BuzzFeed reporter earlier this month. BuzzFeed first reported the investigation.

In a statement, Uber said access to the personal data of anyone using its car service is limited to 'legitimate business purposes.' The San Francisco company said employees violating the rules may be disciplined or fired.

News of the investigation followed a separate BuzzFeed story, which reported that another Uber executive recently threatened to look into the personal lives of journalists that have criticized Uber.

Emil Michael, Uber senior vice president for business, made his remarks in New York during a dinner that was also attended by Mr Kalanick and a list of prominent guests including actor Ed Norton, New York Daily News owner Mort Zuckerman and Huffington Post CEO Arianna Huffington, according to a USA Today column published last Wednesday.

The USA Today column was written by Michael Wolff, a prominent journalist, who said he invited BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith to the Uber dinner without informing his guest that all conversations were supposed to be off the record. Wolff said most other guests at the dinner didn't hear the conversation between Michael and Smith.

Under-fire: Ashton Kutcher entered the firestorm surrounding taxi-hiring app Uber

Ashton Kutcher entered the firestorm surrounding under-fire taxi-hiring app Uber and defended controversial comments made by the executive who suggested spending $1million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticise the company.

Kutcher, an investor in the app, took to Twitter last Wednesday to show his support for beleaguered VP Emil Michael and described Sarah Lacy, a female journalist who has been highly critical of the company, as 'shady'.

'What is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist?' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb and Spotify through his venture capital firm A-Grade. 

So as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts... Yes we should question the source' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber.

'This should be fun... Here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing...' he continued.

Mr Michael apologised for his remarks earlier this week. In a series of messages on his Twitter account, Mr Kalanick rebuked his subordinate.

'His remarks showed a lack of leadership, a lack of humanity, and a departure from our values and ideals,' Mr Kalanick tweeted. He also tweeted that he and Mr Michael would learn from their mistakes.

The incidents have triggered a wave of tweets calling for a boycott of Uber, whose competition in the rapidly growing car-booking industry includes Sidecar and Lyft.
