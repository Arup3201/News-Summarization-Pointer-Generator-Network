A huge car bomb rocked central Beirut today, killing six people including a prominent pro-Western politician opposed to the Syrian regime.

State news agency NNA said that Mohammad Chatah, 62, died as he headed to a meeting of the March 14 coalition at the mansion of ex-prime minister Saad Hariri in the city centre. 

An hour before he was killed, Chatah, a Sunni figure, had tweeted a message slamming Hezbollah.

'Hezbollah
 is pressing hard to be granted similar powers in security & foreign
 policy matters that Syria exercised in Lebanon for 15 years,' he said 
in reference to Syria's nearly 30-year military and political hegemony 
in Lebanon that ended after ex-premier Rafiq Hariri's murder in 2005.

Former prime minister Saad al-Hariri accused the Shiite movement of involvement, saying it was 'a new message of terrorism'.

Rapid response: A Lebanese army soldier gestures as he runs near the site of the explosion which left dozens of people injured, cars ablaze and buildings wrecked

Rocked: The blast sends black smoke scudding across the capital's skyline and over the Serail, a massive complex that houses the offices of the Lebanese prime minister

The bomb targeted Chatah's car, killing him, his driver and at least four others, the National News Agency said.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague tweeted his sympathy to the families of the victims, saying the bombing was 'sad news'.

The powerful Shiite movement 
Hezbollah, a nemesis of the March 14 coalition, has sent militants to 
fight alongside Syrian regime troops against the rebels, triggering the 
wrath of many at home.

The blast also left dozens injured, cars ablaze and buildings wrecked.

Tensions: Chatah sent this tweet denouncing Hezbollah around an hour before he was killed

Footage broadcast by Future TV showed 
people on fire, others lying on the ground, some bloodied, as well as 
the mangled remains of a burning car. Some people were seen walking 
around dazed and shocked.

Ambulances as well as security reinforcements rushed to the stricken area, where large crowds had gathered.

The blast sent thick black smoke 
scudding across the capital's skyline and over the Serail, a massive 
complex that houses the offices of the Lebanese prime minister.

NNA
 news agency gave an initial toll of five people killed and more than 50
 wounded in the blast and said that more than 10 buildings in the area 
were badly damaged.

The Serail, which sits atop a man-built hill and towers over a vibrant city centre, was destroyed in the 1975-1990 civil war.

Mohammad,
 23, a shop attendant in the stricken area, said: 'We were opening our 
store when we heard the blast. It was really loud.

'We are used to blasts in Lebanon but not in this area. Now we are not safe anywhere.'

Ziad,
 a 37-year-old businessman whose office is located near the scene of the
 attack, told AFP: 'Chatah was a really respectful person. He was very 
nice. I was so shocked he has been killed.'

Asked whether he felt safe in the country, which has suffered a string of explosions in recent months, Ziad said: 'If I had the chance to take my wife and children somewhere else, I would.'

The attack was a grim reminder that the violence that tore Lebanon apart during the civil war is never far away and comes as war rages across the border in Syria.

The 33-month conflict, which has 
reportedly killed more than 126,000 people, has deepened political and 
sectarian divisions in Lebanon, and sparked often deadly fighting 
between opponents and supporters of the Syrian regime.

Chatah,
 an influential economist and former minister of finance and Lebanon's 
envoy to Washington, had served as adviser to ex-premiers Fuad Siniora 
and his successor Saad Hariri.

Hariri heads the anti-Syria March 14 coalition, a group which emerged after his billionaire father and ex-premier Rafiq Hariri was killed in a massive Beirut seafront car bombing in February 2005 that was blamed on Syria.

The coalition backs Syrian rebels who have been battling President Bashar al-Assad's forces since mid-March 2011 in a bid to topple his regime.

President Michel Sleiman warned in November that Hezbollah's involvement in Syria was a threat to Lebanon's 'national unity and civil peace'.

His comments to mark the 70th anniversary of Lebanon's independence came just two days after a double suicide bombing struck the embassy of Iran, an ally of both Hezbollah and the Syrian regime, killing 25 people, and weeks after bombings struck Hezbollah's southern Beirut bastion.

Lebanon has been without a government for months over deep divisions between Hezbollah and the parties opposed to its involvement in Syria.

Friday's bombing came as Lebanese celebrated the Christmas festivities.
