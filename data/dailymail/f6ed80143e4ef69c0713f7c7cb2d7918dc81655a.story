As the refereeing fraternity comes under increasing pressure, Sportsmail reveals the shocking disparity between the wages earned by Premier League officials and those who work more in the Football League.

Select Group referees — operating mostly in the Premier League — are believed to earn a basic salary of around £65,000 per year, while they also receive fees in excess of £1,000 per game in the top flight. If they were to officiate 38 games in a season, it would bring their overall pay to more than £100,000.

Referees on the National Group — operating in the Football League — are not on contracts and are paid in the region of £380 a match. They sign up to the National Group on the equivalent of a freelance basis. If they were to officiate the 46 games in a Football League season, they would receive £17,480.

Referees lower down the football food chain earn far less, with potential earnings of around £17,000 per year

Assistant referees on the National List are paid as little as £185 per match while fourth officials receive £110. So an assistant referee in the Championship would receive only £8,510 for a 46-game season but no retainer in the summer months.

In many cases, it will be less because assistant referees are not guaranteed a game in the Football League every week and will also combine fourth-official duties and officiating in non-League games. One assistant estimated that his yearly earnings would be closer to £5,000.

There is also no sliding scale between the Championship and League Two and Sportsmail’s calculations demonstrate that there could, in theory, be an £80,000 gap in pay between refereeing regularly in the Premier League and the Championship.

Football League officials tend to work on a freelance basis meaning it is harder to get regular work

The Select Group and National Group fall under the jurisdiction of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL). The organisation declined to comment on the chasm in wages but they take the view that the rates differ between contracted workers and freelance employers as they would in any other industry.

It means that most National Group officials have a job and referee as a hobby and one source admitted that there have been occasions when they have seen officials ‘extremely tired’ after working a five-day week and then refereeing.

The Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) refused to comment on the huge wage disparity

The lower pay in the Football League is thought to be one reason why there are so few good referees coming through the system. It is also hard to dislodge the top-flight referees, who are determined to stay where they earn the big money.

The Football League say it is an ongoing debate as to whether more officials should be made professional.

The wage discrepancy represents a fresh blow to the credibility of the PGMOL after a festive period that saw a litany of errors by Premier League referees. It led Sportsmail columnist Graham Poll to call for the sacking of Mike Riley, the head of the PGMOL.
