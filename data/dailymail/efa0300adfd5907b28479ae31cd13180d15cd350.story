Rows of police officers stand shoulder to shoulder as a security firm moved in to evict Occupy London protesters from their seven-month stay in Finsbury Square, north London.

Bailiffs set up metal fencing at 1am this morning, surrounding the 135 tents belonging to the anti-capitalist protesters. 

The clear out was organised by Islington Council after a successful court action by the authority to move the group which held London's last remaining Occupy outpost .

Decision: Two weeks ago a judge heard the protest had caused £20,000 damage to the land, cost the council £26,000 on security, and lost it £12,000 in rent plus income from the square’s restaurant which had to close

The camp was set up on the public land of the 
square in October, as an extension of the Occupy movement’s protest in 
St Paul’s Churchyard - which ended in eviction in February.

Today, Metropolitan Police confirmed they were present at the scene which is being cleared by a private security company.

Two weeks ago a judge heard the 
protest had caused £20,000 damage to the land, cost the council £26,000 
on security, and lost it £12,000 in rent plus income from the square’s 
restaurant which had to close.

There had been an adverse impact on 
local business and complaints about anti-social behaviour from the camp,
which increasingly became a focus for the homeless, and which had no 
running water or sufficient toilet facilities.

Councillor Paul Convery, Islington 
Council’s executive member for community safety, said: 'Finsbury Square 
is public space for the people of Islington, one of Britain’s most 
deprived boroughs.

'We’re returning the square to community use, and it is being cleaned and will soon be reopened to the public for the summer.

Occupy protesters had barricaded themselves into their camp on Finsbury Square in the City of London

'Today’s enforcement action was peaceful and low-key, and I’d like to 
thank the police, our street outreach team, and other partner 
organisations for their help.

'A number of vulnerable and homeless people have been living in the 
square. We have been speaking to them and offering advice and support to
those who need assistance.'

Before protesters were evicted from the neighbouring camp at St. Paul's Cathedral in February, Finsbury Square was used as an overspill.

It later became an 'eco village' where sustainable technologies were showcased.

But there was no sign of that now  - the once pleasant park is now a barren, litter-strewn dump.

Until last night 20-30 'protestors' remained at the Finsbury Square camp - eight months after it was first 'occupied'

Islington Borough Council moved in March to start eviction proceedings against the 'residents' of Finsbury Square

Islington Borough Council moved in March to start eviction proceedings against the 'residents' of Finsbury Square.

But Tom McCarthy, a resident at Finsbury Square, insists the camp serves an important purpose.

He wrote on the Occupy Finsbury Square blog: 'This camp makes a political statement about our society.

'Since Occupy opened the camp on 21 
October, it has become a home and community for many homeless people, 
for whom the system has failed.

At one time protesters used the square to showcase sustainable technology, but it is now a litter strewn dump

'In evicting this community, Islington Council – who have helped to re-home some people that have ticked certain boxes – are potentially leaving some people in a much worse position than they are already in.

'We ask Islington Council to not go down the same route at the City of London Corporation – cleansing the City of homeless people is not the way forward. Helping to find real solutions is.'

Islington Council claims the camp is now just occupied by vulnerable and homeless people

Banners erected on the camp preached anti-capitalist slogans, despite claims by councillors the square has become a haven for the homeless

Now the square has been repossessed Islington Borough Council are keen to start fixing the damage caused by protesters
