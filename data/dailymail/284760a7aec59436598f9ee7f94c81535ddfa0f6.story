The explosive Senate Committee torture report could open the floodgates for costly lawsuits against the U.S., Britain and any other countries complicit with the CIA's so-called 'enhanced interrogation' programme, top lawyers have warned.

Experts who have spent years working at American detention centres said yesterday's report did not contain any surprises, but suggested that now detainees' torture allegations are supported by an official government report, claimants have far more evidence to back any legal action.

Human rights lawyers are currently working their way through the 525-page report, which confirmed the existence of secret CIA prisons around the world, in the hope of finding material that could provide the breakthrough needed to revive dormant and failed lawsuits launched by detainees.

Implications: Experts who have spent years working at American detention centres such as Guantanamo Bay (pictured) say that now detainees' torture allegations are supported by an official government report, claimants have a huge amount of new official material can be used to back their legal claims

Previously, private claimants and international non-governmental organizations have found it incredibly difficult to win legal challenges alleging illegal interrogation by the CIA and its allies.

This is largely because, until now, the U.S. government has insisted that all details of the detentions and related extraordinary rendition hearings were state secrets, and therefore not valid evidence.

But now that many of the individuals' allegations have been confirmed as true by the Senate Committee report, a huge amount of new and official material can be used to back future claims.

'One of the tragedies about this is the attempt to find redress,' Andrea Prasow, a senior official at Human Rights Watch told Bloomberg.

'Judges have accepted the state secrets claim. Now it will be much harder to do that when we all have access to a 500-page public report that details a lot of this,' she added. 

Chained and kneeling: Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees captured in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks were transferred to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba

The chances of an American court reopening civil or criminal charges against senior CIA officials remains slim, as the Justice Department has already carried out its own investigations into the agency, which only led to the prosecution of low-level employees and contractors.

However a far more realistic prospect it that former detainees could launch legal action against Bush administration officials in European courts under the rules of universal jurisdiction.

Universal jurisdiction allows states or international organizations to claim criminal jurisdiction over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed, and regardless of the accused's nationality, country of residence, or any other relation with the prosecuting entity.

'After reviewing this report, we will give consideration to reopening petitions or filing new petitions in European courts under the principles of universal jurisdiction,' said Baher Azmy - the legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, which has previously represented Guantanamo detainees. 

'The comprehensiveness and detail of this declassified report is thorough evidence of a criminal conspiracy of U.S. officials to torture dozens of human beings,' he added.  

Global: At its height, the CIA program included secret prisons in countries including Afghanistan, Thailand, Romania, Lithuania and Poland — locations that are referred to only by color-themed codes in the report

Britain is expected to be among the countries where former detainees launch legal action over the government's alleged complicity in the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation techniques'.

One example would be in the case of Libyan Islamist politician Abdel-Hakim Belhaj who, in a joint MI6-CIA operation in 2003, was snatched along with his wife from their home in Bangkok, Thailand.

Belhaj was flown back to Libya where he faced years of torture in one of then-leader Muammar Gaddafi's notorious prisons as punishment for his conservative views.

Cori Crider, who represents several people who were rendered to CIA-run prisons in the early 2000s, told Time: 'The British government has always said those cases cannot go to trial because 'it will damage our relations with the U.S.'

'But if the Senate is involved in a very detailed examination of torture, that excuse by the British government is exposed for the kabuki that it is,' he added. 

Threat: Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Mamdouh Habi is the first person to threaten to sue over his detention since the release of the torture report

Earlier an Australian man who was held at Guantanamo Bay without charge for three years has become the first person to threaten to sue over his detention since the release of the report.

Mamdouh Habib was arrested in Pakistan in October 2001 and deported  to Egypt, where he says he was tortured for five months before being transported to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.

Mr Habib said he was happy that yesterday's U.S. Senate Committee report concluded that the CIA's use of 'enhanced interrogation' techniques on suspected terrorists amounted to torture and had failed to produce any information that could be used to prevent imminent terror attacks.

He also warned that he intends to reopen his legal cases against the U.S. and Australian governments - the latter of which Mr Habib claims was effectively complicit in torture when it failed to prevent his extraordinary rendition from Pakistan to Egypt.

Mr Habib has been attempting to sue the Egyptian government over his rendition, detention and alleged torture, but his case collapsed just two weeks ago when the Australian government refused to verify that the documents he was using to present his case to the Cairo court were official.

His lawyers had been given five days to present the verification, but a lawyer for the Australian government told the court that they have invoked their right to diplomatic immunity and refused to take part in the hearing.

The documents Mr Habib had wanted to present in the Cairo court had already been accepted in Australian investigations and legal proceedings to prove that both the Australian and Egyptian governments were aware  of where he had been taken after the CIA transported him from Pakistan.

A 2011 investigation carried out by Australia's Inspector-General of Intelligence Services concluded that officials in both Australia and Egypt were aware of his detention there, and resulted in Mr Habib been paid an undisclosed amount of money to drop his case against them.

Comment: Moazzam Begg told Sky News this morning that CIA 'torture' of terrorism suspects had fuelled violence and the rise of Islamic State and that releasing details of it wouldn't help

Mr Habib believes that the release of the CIA torture report gives him enough grounds to reopen his case against both the Egyptian and Australian governments, and also to pursue new claims against the United States itself.

The 59-year-old was arrested by the CIA in Pakistan just one month after the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center attacks in New York. 

He was held and interrogated in Egypt for a year before being transported to Guantanamo Bay, where he was detained for three years without charge before eventually being released. 

The Australian government were subsequently forced to charter a A$500,000 plane to return Mr Habib to home soil as the U.S banned him leaving the country on a commercial flight, despite the fact he has never been charged with terrorism offences.

Horror: Moazzam Begg was then held for nearly three years at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba (pictured), where he said psychological tortures included execution threats and light deprivation

This morning a former British inmate of Guantanamo Bay said CIA 'torture' of terrorism suspects had fuelled violence and the rise of Islamic State and that cataloguing it wouldn't help.

Moazzam Begg also said the release of the report, which included graphic details of 'enhanced interrogation' techniques used by the CIA, would do nothing to assuage anger about such actions across the Muslim world.

'I don't think it will be teaching us anything we didn't already know,' Begg said. 'It doesn't make anything better.'

He said examples cited in the report of brutality by CIA interrogators at secret prisons around the world 'can only produce one result - false evidence, more hatred'.

Begg was then held for nearly three years at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, where he said psychological tortures included execution threats and light deprivation. He also claimed to have been kept in solitary confinement for almost two years.

During his detention, Begg said he was subjected to the sound of a woman screaming in a nearby cell whom he believed to be his wife under torture. He said he was told he'd be sent to Syria if he didn't cooperate, and that he saw two people being punched and kicked to death by U.S. soldiers.

A UN envoy and human rights groups have demanded that senior officials in the administration of George W Bush are prosecuted over the 'brutal' interrogation of Al Qaeda suspects.

UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism Ben Emmerson said it was clear that criminal techniques revealed yesterday in the Senate Committee so-called 'torture report', had been a 'clear policy orchestrated at a high level'.

Mr Emmerson said senior officials from the Bush administration who had been involved in planning and sanctioning the crimes must face legal action. He added that CIA and US government officials responsible for torture such as waterboarding should also be prosecuted.

'As a matter of international law, the U.S. is legally obliged to bring those responsible to justice,' he said in a statement made from Geneva.

'The US attorney general is under a legal duty to bring criminal charges against those responsible,' Mr Emmerson added.

Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth said that the CIA's actions were criminal 'and can never be justified', adding: Unless this important truth-telling process leads to prosecution of officials, torture will remain a 'policy option' for future presidents.'
