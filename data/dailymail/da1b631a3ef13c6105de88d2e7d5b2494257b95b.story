Paul Pogba's agent has claimed his client will remain at Juventus next season despite being a reported target of top European clubs.

The France midfielder has become one of the hottest prospects in European football since moving to Turin in 2012 after leaving Manchester United.

Media reports in England claimed Chelsea are willing to make a Â£60million offer to Juve in order to lure Paris St Germain and Real Madrid target Pogba to Stamford Bridge.

'We have decided not to speak of the transfer market with regards to Paul until after the World Cup,' Pogba's agent Mino Raiola said to Italian TV station Rai Sport. 'But I can calmly say that his future will still be at Juventus, where he feels very happy.'

Pogba currently has two years left on his contract at Juve, who want to extend that.

The Golden Ball winner at the 2013 Under-20 World Cup was a regular feature in Antonio Conte's side as they successfully defended their Serie A title last season.
