Assuming Northern Ireland don’t now stumble on the road to France, they will owe a big debt of thanks to their big No 10 for firing his country to a major championships for the first time in 30 years.

Not since the 1986 World Cup have the Northern Irish graced a big stage. Indeed, they have never qualified for the finals of the European Championships.

But after Kyle Lafferty scored twice against Finland at Windsor Park to take his total in qualifying to five goals in five games, Michael O’Neill’s side will never have a better chance as they remain one point behind leaders Romania following their fourth win of the campaign.

Northern Ireland remain just one point behind Group F leaders Romania 

 

The two countries meet here in June when Northern Ireland will have a great opportunity to go top. Even if it all goes wrong, this result puts them eight points clear of fourth-placed Finland and almost guaranteed of at least a playoff place.

‘We’re in a really strong position, there’s no doubt about that,’ said O’Neill. ‘Will 18 points be enough? Possibly. But Belfast in June is as far as we’re looking ahead.’

Finland simply couldn’t handle Lafferty, the 6ft 4in striker on loan to Turkish club Caykur Rizespor from Norwich after a frustrating spell at Carrow Road, who made life as difficult for them as possible in the blustery conditions.

He had already caused central defenders Joona Toivio and Niklas Moisander plenty of problems before putting Northern Ireland in command with two classy finishes in the space of six minutes.

The first goal came from a freekick after Lafferty was fouled by an exasperated Moisander in the 33rd minute. Finland cleared Oliver Norwood’s inswinging free-kick but Niall McGinn nodded the ball back to Lafferty 15 yards from goal and he showed fantastic technique to turn and volley it beyond goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky and into the far corner.

Ireland looked most dangerous down their right-hand side and when Jamie Ward and Conor McLaughlin combined once again in the 38th minute, Lafferty met Conor McLaughlin’s pin-point cross with a glancing header into the bottom corner.

Premier League stars such as Jonny Evans (centre left on back row) and Chris Brunt (centre right on back row) started for Northern Ireland 

It was no surprise to see Toivio hooked at half-time in favour of the more muscular Paulus Arajuuri – ‘a tactical substitution,’ was the curt response from Finland boss Mixu Paatelainen afterwards – or Lafferty receive a standing ovation when he was replaced by Josh Magennis 11 minutes from time.

He is now second only to David Healy in the list of Ireland’s all-time leading goalscorers.

‘Kyle was outstanding again and he scored two fantastic goals,’ added O’Neill. ‘He’s going on the pitch believing he’s capable of scoring every time he plays.

‘It’s a little bit like the David Healy situation where things at club level aren’t going as well as he would like. But he’s showing what he’s capable of against top-class European defenders.’

Finland substitute Berat Sadik pulled a goal back in the first of three minutes of added time to set up an unnecessarily nervy finish, but Ireland held on and the celebrations told their own story. France is in sight.
