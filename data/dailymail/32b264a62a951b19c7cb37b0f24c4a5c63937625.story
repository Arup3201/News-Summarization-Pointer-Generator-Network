Leicester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel showed the ability to execute overhead kicks runs in the family, after he scored a stunning effort in pre-season training.

Kasper’s dad Peter set the overhead benchmark for the Schmeichel family, when he saw a last-minute effort disallowed while playing for Manchester United against Wimbledon in 1997.

The Denmark international was larking around with Leicester’s other goalkeepers at their training base in Austria when he flung himself into the air and sent an unstoppable effort into the bottom corner after meeting a cross from the right.

Neil Pearson’s side are based in Bad 
Radkersburg until Friday, when they will return to the UK to play a 
string of friendlies before the Premier League starts.

Schmeichel,
 who played a key role in Leicester’s impressive Championship win last 
season, joined the group late on Sunday afternoon following 
international commitments at the end of last term, but showed no signs 
of rustiness if the clip of his overhead kick is anything to go by.
