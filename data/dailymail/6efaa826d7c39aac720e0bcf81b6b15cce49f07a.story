Former Coronation Street and The Bill actor Andrew Lancel arrives at Liverpool Crown Court with wife Louise

The wife of former Coronation Street actor Andrew Lancel has told a court he is not gay and that they share a 'healthy' relationship.

Lancel, who played rapist Frank Foster in the long-running ITV soap, denies sexually assaulting a boy of 15.

Wife Louise said she met the actor 14 years ago and married him in 2005. They have a four-year-old son.

After Andrew Menary QC, defending, asked if she shared 'a healthy heterosexual relationship' with her husband, to which she replied: 'Yes.'

The QC then asked: 'Are you aware of anything that suggests an interest in men?'

She said: 'None whatsoever.'

She said she knew the man making the allegations, who is now 34 and a West End dancer, because he had been a friend of her husband's.

She said the accuser was invited to their wedding but did not attend.

Mr Menary asked: 'Have you been aware of any hostility on his part towards your husband before these allegations?'

The dance teacher replied: 'No.'

Lancel's best friend and former flatmate Thomas Burrows, 34, told the jury he had known the actor for 20 years and there had never been any sexual contact between them.

Lancel, 42, denies six indecent assaults between 1993 and 1994.

The judge has told the jury he will order them to find him not guilty of the two oldest charges.

The trial continues at Liverpool Crown Court.
