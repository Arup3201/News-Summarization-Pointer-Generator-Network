It is the clever online facility that we all use on occasion to take an advance peek at a place of interest – a restaurant we are planning to visit, a friend’s hard-to-locate flat.

But now, intrigued would be-travellers can use Google Street View to virtually explore a more tricky-to-find location – the deck of an ocean-going liner.

Surf's up: Passengers can glimpse facilities on the Allure Of The Seas through Google Street view

Cruise company Royal Caribbean International has taken the forward step of opening up one of its ships, the Allure Of The Seas, to Google Maps Business View.

The idea is that passengers thinking of booking a seaborne holiday on this grand vessel can take a tour of its amenities before they part with their money.

Through dint of modern technology, they can ‘wander’ the 225,282-tonne oceanic giant, and check out the likes of its Royal Promenade – a boulevard which runs almost the full length of the ship, flanked by restaurants and bars – and its ‘green space’ Central Park.

Other facilities which can be espied with this virtual eye include two ‘Flowrider’ surf simulators, 15 pools, two rock-climbing walls and a zip-line thrill ride.

The idea, the company explains, will enable customers to ‘try before they buy’.

‘We’re thrilled to be at the forefront of the industry when it comes to delivering innovative technologies – whether it be Roboscreens and digital shows on our newest ships, or Google Street View technology on our website,’ says Jo Briody of Royal Caribbean International.

‘Consumers can go online to research their holidays, and this is the closest they can get to actually being on board.

‘We are confident that once people get virtually immersed in the Allure of the Seas thanks to Google Street View, they will be eager to experience the real thing.’

Over 20,000 images were taken to provide this revolutionary view of the liner.

This was a task that took 60 working hours – over the space of eight days – to complete.

Pictures were taken with a basic DSLR camera, but using a fisheye lens – with 12 photographs taken in each position to capture the ship in the best light.

The results can be seen at www.royalcarribean.co.uk/royalview.

Room for everyone: Areas such as the on-board theatre and two climbing walls are also available to view

The Allure Of The Seas launched in November 2009, and is based at Port Everglades, near Fort Lauderdale, in Florida.
