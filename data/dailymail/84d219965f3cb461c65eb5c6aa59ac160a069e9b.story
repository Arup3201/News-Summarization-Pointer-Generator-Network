Decorated with floral crowns and large bells - and treated like celebrities - the cows of the Bavarian Alps know it can mean only one thing: time to get moo-ving.

Assisted by herders dressed in traditional attire, the animals are returning from summer alpine grazing  during the annual cattle drive in the Allgaeu region of Bad Hindelang, Germany.

Every spring, cattle herders bring thousands of them to mountain meadows, and the cows remain there throughout summer months before being brought back down the valleys to farms in the villages for winter.
