It's billed as the most technologically advanced cruise ship ever built.

So it's ironic that I can't connect to the Wifi on my iPhone as I set sail on Quantum Of The Seas - but it's only temporary.

I'm one of the first guests on board the world's first smartship, sailing from Southampton to Cornwall and back before it makes its way to New York on Sunday and relocates to the Caribbean.

Big ship: Touted as the world’s first smartship, Quantum of the Seas is the most high-tech cruise ship in the world. The vessel sails from Southampton to Cornwall and back before it makes its way to New York on Sunday and relocates to the Caribbean

Jewel in the crown: North Star, a London Eye-style pod on the top deck lifting passengers 300ft above sea level, offering thrilling views

There, passengers will be able to connect to the ultra-fast O3b technology, not yet available in the UK, but Royal Caribbean promises it will be by the time its next liner, Anthem Of The Seas arrives here in the spring.

At 1,141ft long, Quantum Of The Seas is the length of 41 London buses and longer than five Boeing 747s. It’s the third largest cruise ship in the world, making for an impressive sight as it docked in Southampton on Friday.

But looking like rows of floating flats, it's not the outside that's the attraction.

Inside boasts robotic bartenders serving cocktails, a skydiving simulator, a world-first digital entertainment system, on-board dodgems, and virtual balconies in windowless rooms.

And then there's the jewel in the crown - North Star, a London Eye-style pod on the top deck lifting passengers 300ft above sea level, offering thrilling panoramic ocean views.

It's the ultimate ship designed with tech-savvy holidaymakers in mind.

Cutting-edge technology: The whirring blue robotic arm bartenders that shake and stir your poison according to your tastes

The ship's architecture is complemented by a multi-million dollar, 2,980 art collection including this a huge butterfly wall by the glass lifts

The passenger pod, similar to the capsules on the London Eye, offers 360-degree panoramic views of the ocean 

Guests can find swimming pools, sunbeds and hottubs - as well as a bar serving drinks throughout the day on Deck 15

And the digital experience begins before guests even leave home - where they can check in online as well as book on-board dining, spa appointments and shore excursions. 

The checking in process is efficient. From arriving at the port in Southampton to taking my first step on Quantum takes about seven minutes - none of the usual airport queues.

The incredibly designed Quantum, which took three years to build and weighs 167,800 tonnes, certainly delivers on its 'wow factor' promise.

There are 18 decks, 2,090 staterooms, 16 glass elevators, and room for a staggering 4,905 passengers and 1,500 crew members.

Once on board, it's a case of what to do first.

Decks four and five are lined with elegant Las Vegas-style restaurants, bars and shops selling everything from pints of beer and slices of pizza, to champagne and diamonds.

The indoor active space iFly on level 16 boasts on-board dodgem cars as well as a a circus school with flying trapeze, and roller skating

Located next to a rock-climbing wall, the jewel of the ship’s art collection is a 30-foot magenta polar bear on the exterior deck

Level 16 boasts iFly - the world's first skydive simulator at sea - as well as North Star, a five-star spa, a surf simulator, a climbing wall, and Seaplex, the largest indoor active space at sea, with gaming, a circus school and bumper cars.

Deck 15 is where guests can find swimming pools, sunbeds and hottubs - as well as a pool-side bar playing music and serving drinks throughout the day.

And the showstopping Two70 entertainment venue – featuring vast, floor-to-ceiling glass walls spanning three decks and offering 270-degree panoramic sea views – with its five-star lounge-style seating, and chic cocktails, is on levels four and five.

Inside, the ship's awesome architecture is complemented by a multi-million dollar, 2,980 art collection – from a huge butterfly wall by the glass lifts, and on-board galleries, to the 30ft-tall magenta polar bear made from stainless steel triangles standing proud on the ship’s exterior deck.

My 11th floor statecabin is spacious and modern, boasting USB plugs, a flat-screen TV, a double bed, a sofa and blue, grey and cream decor, as well as plenty of storage and a shower room - although toiletries are only available upon request. There's also a balcony with two chairs affording an impressive ocean view.

The passenger pod, similar to the capsules on the London Eye, offers 360-degree panoramic views of the ocean 

 Room with a view: The pod suspends passengers out over the side of the ship for unparalleled views across the ocean

Weighs 168,666 gross tonnes

1,141 feet long - 2.5 longer than the Great Pyramid of Giza is tall

Cruising speed: 22 knots - faster than Usain Bolt's average by a bow

Space for 4,905 guests in total and 1,500 crew

136 feet wide - three times wider than a basketball court

Boasts 2,090 staterooms (375 with virtual balconies)

North Star pod takes guests 300ft above sea level

Four bow thrusters produce 4,694 horsepower each - equal to 24 F1 cars

Ship is three times the size of the International Space Station; 11 times bigger than a blue whale

Cost £133,000 per berth to build

For those in windowless rooms, virtual balconies are available – a full-length screen showing a boat’s eye view as the vessel travels; but it comes at an extra cost.

My Wow wristband gives me access to my room - as well as allowing me to make purchases; in theory linking to on board app Royal iQ, which guests can use to manage their holiday - but it doesn't work efficiently during the pre-inaugural voyage, so I resort to the old-fashioned method of writing everything down instead.

The wristband also takes away the need to ever carry around cash - which is potentially dangerous with plenty of high-end shops dotted around.

On decks four and five are where most of the 18 restaurants are located - including Jamie's Italian; Jamie Oliver's first outlet at sea; and Wonderland, which offers an experimental dining ‘experience’ in an glamorous and quirky setting.

In a concept called Dynamic Dining, the cruise ship's traditional main dining room has been 'reimagined' as five complimentary restaurants.

No free-for-all buffet here. Instead, these are elegant, well-thought-out eateries offering five-star dining, adventurous dishes and top-notch wines, with waiters using tablets to communicate orders immediately with the kitchen.

These are the types of restaurants you would want to dine at even if you weren't at sea.

Guests have the opportunity to dine in some of the restaurants free of charge, while others (including Jamie’s Italian) have an extra fee attached.

After a ride on the North Star, which takes us on an incredibly high, but very smooth ride, I enjoy champagne in the chic Diamond Club, before dining in the luxurious Chops Grille, which specialises in steak and fish dishes.

Quantum of the Seas' robot bartenders -  the first of their kind in the world - prove to be yet another form of entertainment on the ship

When Two70 becomes an entertainment venue at night, it uses six ‘roboscreens’ that move or unite as one to entertain passengers

 Our waiter is friendly and helpful, and the food is superb, everything is faultless. Even though I'm full the dessert menu is not to be passed on - and I finish with a calorific red velvet sponge cake smothered in cream.

The evening doesn't end there. As well as a production of Mamma Mia, guests can book to watch the exclusive show StarWater in the spectacular Two70 venue - the screen technology is incredible, offering a backdrop only rivalled by theatres but without the need for the space.

After that, there's a late-night casino on deck three - with designated smoking areas, which is odd to see inside - with card tables and slot machines flashing their lights until the early hours, as well as tribute bands playing in bars, piano players tinkering late into the night, and DJs taking the party on until the next day.

Around every corner there is something whirring, something to touch, something to taste, or something to experience.

The cruise ship is filled with shops and 18 restaurants and bars to keep passengers entertained on board

Royal Caribbean owns the world’s three largest cruise ships – Allure of the Seas, the Oasis of the Seas and the Quantum of the Seas

Quantum of the Seas boasts 18 decks and has room for 4,180 guests. The ship is three times the size of the International Space Station

I place my order for a drink courtesy of the whirring blue robotic arm bartenders, that shake and stir your poison according to your tastes.

There’s a queue already, with people having to wait nine minutes for their order – but there are no groans of frustration, as the bionic staff prove to be entertainment enough.

Royal Caribbean says it has created the ship with the modern holidaymaker in mind - and that it opens cruising up to a younger, tech-savvy audience.

But it adds that although Quantum Of The Seas is designed with technology at its fore, guests can choose not to use it.

However, with the digital concept at the heart of what’s on offer on board this smartship, it’s not the type of vessel to travel on if you want to switch off - but it's perfect if you are switched on.

It's the future of cruising ... or, at least, it will be as soon as the Wifi connection works.
