After suffering the torment of losing their unborn child, Edward and Colleen Ogilvie today welcomed baby Martin - believed to be the first arrival of 2014.

Weighing 4lb 7.5oz the newborn was delivered six weeks early at 12.01am after his mother Colleen Ogilvie suffered a complication during her pregnancy.

The 38-year-old civil servant had been expecting twins.

But in November, after being diagnosed with placenta previa, which causes the placenta to cover the opening of the womb, Mrs Ogilvie was rushed into hospital where doctors revealed she had lost one of her babies.

Tiny Martin Ogilvie was born at 12.01am at St Johns Hospital in Livingston, Scotland. His parents Edward and Colleen believe he was the first newborn to arrive in 2014

Martin was expected to arrive closer to his due date on February 10.

But on New Years Eve, when first-time father Edward Ogilvie, 40, returned to the couple's West Lothian home after visiting his parents in Edinburgh, it became clear their son had no plans to wait another month.

Mrs Ogilvie said she started to become concerned after noticing she was bleeding.

'Colleen was standing in the doorway of our house and she just said 'don't put the car away,' Mr Ogilvie said.

'We came in to the hospital at about 7.15pm. At that point, delivery hadn't been discussed.

The newborn, weighing 4lb 7.5oz, arrived six weeks early after his mother suffered complications during her pregnancy

'It was a bit touch and go, and then we were told he was going to be delivered.

'We've been in the hospital about five or six times recently, and the staff were just fantastic.'

She added: 'The decision to deliver him was made about 11.15pm and then by the time everything was prepared it was 11.30pm and we knew we were going to have our baby.

'Because of the contractions and the bleeding, I was really nervous. You never know how it's going to go.

'When I began experiencing bleeding and contractions at home it was heavier than before so I was quite concerned.'

Martin is believed to be the first baby born in the UK after the bells chimed at midnight.

And his proud parents said they plan to make sure he knows all about his special arrival when he grows up.

Mrs Ogilvie said: 'Its definitely a tale we'll be telling Martin - we are just both so glad he's here.

'I'm just totally stunned. We weren't expecting him to be so early.

'The nurses have been fantastic, before, during and afterwards. Nothing has been a problem.

'We are just so thrilled and thankful that he's here safe now.'

The couple, who have been married for 10 years, moved to Winchburgh from Edinburgh city centre when they decided to start a family.

Mr Ogilvie said: 'I'm just speechless now that he's here. I'm more shocked than anything else.

'We were trying to get everything ready for his room and now he's here - it still feels like a dream because Colleen had been in and out of hospital.'

Placenta previa can cause bleeding, which in turn can cause complications in pregnancy.

The condition can result in mothers having to deliver early and if a woman is suffering placenta previa at the time of giving birth, she will have to have a cesarean section.

Martin's arrival was all the more poignant for proud parents Edward and Colleen, after the couple suffered the loss of his twin in November. Mrs Ogilvie was rushed into hospital where doctors diagnosed her with placenta previa, which causes the placenta to grow over the opening of the womb
