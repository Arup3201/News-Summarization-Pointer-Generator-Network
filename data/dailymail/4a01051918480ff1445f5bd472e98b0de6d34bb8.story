Weighing less than one pound this two-day old Humboldt penguin is the epitome of adorable.

With its miniscule wings and perfectly formed beak, the fluffy, grey baby penguin is the newest addition to an adventure park and zoo in Pembrokeshire, Wales.

The youngster - which weighs a tiny 0.2 pounds - was born on Tuesday, exactly a year to the day that a pack of 24 penguins were released into a new enclosure at the park.

The 48-hour old chick is the offspring of Donna and Diavlo – who were the first penguins to pair off and build a nest together in February.  

Zoo keepers are yet to discover the gender of the newborn and as such are holding off on naming the adorable youngster.

Catrin Thomas, a penguin keeper at the Folly Farm zoo, said: ‘We are so excited to have our first penguin chick at the park.

‘We all feel like proud parents and are so happy for Donna and Diavlo.

‘We haven’t named the chick yet as we 
do not know what sex it is but once we do we will give it a suitable 
name - it may have to begin with ‘D’ though to follow in its parents 
footsteps.’

The adorable baby Humboldt penguin was born weighing just 73 grammes (pictured) but now weighs 75 grammes - 0.2 pounds

The chick is currently surviving on a diet of fish, which are regurgitated by its parents' mouths in small but frequent amounts.

Humboldt penguins originate from South America and commonly breed in the coastal areas off Peru and Chile.

An adult Humboldt can grow to around 70cm in length and weighs on average nine pounds.

Wild Humboldt’s tend to nest in burrows among boulders and sea caves, but sometimes set up home in the open.

Most birds depart the colony after sunrise and forage in close proximity, not venturing too far away from the pack.

They survive on a diet mainly made up of small schooling fish like anchovies and sardines, but sometimes supplement it with squid.

Once it gets a bit older it will be ‘enrolled into penguin school’ where it will be taught by keepers how to eat and fend for itself.

Caroline Davies, who also works as a keeper at the Penguin Coast enclosure at the park, said she was hopeful of more arrivals in the near future.

She said: ‘We hope this is just the start of a deluge of chicks in our Humboldt penguin enclosure.

‘We currently have ten eggs being incubated by our penguin brood so are anticipating the arrival of more any day now.’

In the first few weeks of the chick’s 
life, the keepers will be extremely hands-on to ensure sure the new 
parents and the offspring get off to the best possible start.

The
 keepers will then teach the newborn chick how to feed for itself at Folly Farm's two acre state-of-the-art penguin enclosure which comes 
complete with a 100m saltwater pool and manmade beach.

Tim Morphew, zoo manager, said the young penguin was the first to be born at the park’s new enclosure which opened last Easter.

He
 said: ‘The arrival of chicks in our penguin enclosure demonstrates that
 we have successfully created a healthy breeding environment for our 
penguins that is as close as possible to their natural habitat.

‘We
 are delighted that our first breeding season has been a success and we 
look forward to welcoming more little ones to our penguin crèche.’
