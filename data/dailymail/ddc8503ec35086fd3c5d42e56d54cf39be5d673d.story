Ronan Farrow has been a big success at nearly everything in his life so far, but ratings for his MSNBC talk show are apparently so bad that he is facing the possibility of being axed just a month after launch.

Mia Farrow’s 26-year-old son was handed his own TV show, Ronan Farrow Daily, which premiered in late February in a blaze of publicity.

Despite little prior experience, MSNBC had high hopes that Farrow will help them attract millennial viewers, something which hasn’t happened so far.

Ratings for Ronan Farrow's MSNBC talk show are apparently so bad that he is facing the possibility of being axed just a month after launch

‘He sort of stinks on TV,’ an MSNBC source told the Daily News. ‘He hasn’t turned out to be the superstar they were hoping for.’

The news network had hoped that Farrow, a Rhodes scholar who graduated college when he was 15 and went on to graduate from Yale and Oxford, would bring his 245,000 Twitter followers with him to television.

‘But that hasn’t happened,’ the source said. ‘Just because someone is a boy genius-turned-Twitter star doesn’t mean they deserve their own TV show.’

Last Wednesday, Farrow drew an average of about 312,000 total viewers and was 708th among all programming ranked by Nielsen, in both total viewers and the 18-to-49 age group advertisers covet.

Things looked more positive in February for Farrow when he coveted a converted journalism award

Embarassingly it was beaten by the likes of an 8 a.m. repeat of Golden Girls on the Hallmark Channel.

Farrow, who worked for the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Obama administration, has looked uncomfortable on camera and often stumbles over his words.

MSNBC moved quickly to issue a denial: ‘This is simply not true. We’re happy with the debut of Ronan Farrow Daily and the show’s progress this first month. MSNBC will continue to support Ronan and his team as they develop and grow the program.’

But on his Twitter feed, Ronan appeared to be addressing his ratings slum when he recently tweeted: 'Waking up to another crushing day of not being Oprah.’

It was all so different back in February when he received a prestigious journalism award after a grand total of three hours of daytime television.

Farrow was handed The Cronkite Award for Excellence in Exploration and Journalism at a ceremony in New York.

The honor is named for renowned American journalist Walter Cronkite, who presented the first award in 1984.

Also
 in February Woody Allen wrote that Ronan, his son, could have been 
fathered by Frank Sinatra and claimed that mother Mia Farrow may have 
been lying about it for decades.

The
 Annie Hall director said Ronan, his only biological child with Farrow, 
‘looks a lot like Frank’ thanks to his blue eyes and similar facial 
features.

Allen said 
that if it were true then Farrow would have kept a dark secret during 
their bitter custody battle 21 years ago to make him pay child support.

Allen’s
 claims were in response to an article in Vanity Fair magazine in which 
Farrow said that Sinatra was ‘possibly’ Ronan’s father.

Woody Allen has questioned whether Ronan Farrow is his biological son. There is speculation that Frank Sinatra is his real father
