Manchester City has asked for a historic Austrian church to silence its bells to avoid disturbing star players during their pre-season training camp in the Tyrolean mountains.

It is one on a long list of strict conditions City boss Roberto Mancini’s has requested that also include handmade £1,000 specially-designed mattresses and the meticulous arrangement of condiments on hotel tables at meal times.

Details of City’s travel requirements were revealed by Alois Seyrling, manager of the Klosterbrau Hotel - a former monastery that is almost 500 years old - which will be the squad’s home until July 20.

Bells be gone: The bells of St Oswald's church in the Austrian Tyrol won't ring at 7am while City players sleep soundly in the five-star hotel right next door

Star treatment: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero walked the red carpet as he arrived in Seefeld and will get a star's sleep without church bells chiming at 7am and a specially-made mattress and blanket costing almost £1,000

Silent St Oswald's: Traditional chiming bells dating back to the 13th century have been silenced for an extra hour of sleep for the City players

The bells at St Oswald’s in Seefeld, a
13th century Catholic church which adjoins the five star hotel, 
normally chime on the hour from 7am but during City’s stay they will be 
delayed by an hour to start at 8am at the request of team officials, Mr 
Seyrling said.

He said it was a very special request.

‘They
wanted to ask the priest to switch off the bells of the church because 
we are attached to it and the bells are ringing at seven in the morning,
eight in the morning and nine in the morning,’ he said.

City are spending more than £200,000 
for their stay in the small village, a favourite destination of wealthy 
winter sports fans, in preparation for defending their Premier League 
title.

Five star training: City is spending over £200,000 for their training taking out 54 rooms in the five star hotel in preparation to defend their Premier League title

All to Austria: City's medical and fitness teams have been flown to the Austrian town to make sure players including Sergio Aguero (left) and Carlos Tevez (right) get into shape in time for the season

The hotel has spent 
three months preparing for the arrival of stars like Sergio Aguero and 
Yaya Toure in what has been a painstaking process.

They were required to import 
specially-approved mattresses, handmade in Rome, as City insisted on a 
specific density and height to offer optimum support for players’ backs.

Along
with lightweight blankets, which had to be 3cm thick, the cost came in 
at little under £1,000 per bed for each of the 54 rooms booked out by 
last season’s title-winners.

When it came to accommodating 6ft 3in 
Yaya Toure, it required a specially-extended bed, driven over personally
by the manufacturer in time for the Ivory Coast international’s 
arrival.

After a hard day's training: Players will relax with the hotel's spa treatments during their intensive fortnight of training

Towering Toure: The hotel made sure a specially-extended bed for 6ft 3in player Yaya Toure was driven in personally by the manufacturer

Toure is also the only player to have his own massage table in his room.

The restrictions also stretch to the dining room, with the team’s Italian coach making sure the player’s dietary requirements are kept in check by forbidding all chocolates and snacks in minibars, bread and butter, and ordering hotel staff to not place sauces on tables.

Mayonnaise or ketchup will only be allowed on special request and the parmesan cheese must be situated in the exact position for every meal.

The City chef has been brought over and fresh fish is flown in every two days as well as a huge amount of bottled water from England.

Mr Seyrling said: ‘They want privacy in the restaurant and we have a very clear set-up for the buffet.

'The set-up is very detailed in the restaurant - down to how much space is in between the chairs.

'The manager I have heard is quite strict. They sent us the menu so we have all of the products so their chef can prepare the meals.

'Fish is flown in. Most of the products we always buy locally because Austria has a high standard, especially for beef but the special fish they requested will be flown in fresh every two days from France, the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea.

City have also brought their entire medical and fitness teams with them to the picturesque region.

The hotel offers a range of unusual spa treatments to help the players wind down after a day’s training including a tiny room in the stone-walled basement, containing an old-fashioned bread oven and three easy chairs.

It is intended to offer a relaxing experience while guests can also enjoy the aroma of freshly baked bread.

There is also a tank filled with garra rufa fish to eat dead skin from the feet as well as hay bath.

Meticulous managing: City boss Roberto Mancini says no to bread and butter, and chocolate and snacks in the minibars in players' rooms

More than Manchester: Seefeld was the training destination for Holland during their 2010 World Cup preparation and Inter Milan is negotiating to stay next summer

Players could also do a session in the infra red room to help ease tension.

The quaint Austrian town has proved to 
be a popular destination for football teams with Monaco currently 
staying in a nearby hotel and the five-star hotel has accommodated 
Holland as they prepared for the 2010 World Cup and Inter Milan are 
negotiating to stay there next summer.
