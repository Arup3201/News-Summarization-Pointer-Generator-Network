Charles Townes, who shared
the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for revolutionary invention of the laser,  has died at age 99.

Townes, a native of South Carolina, recalled that the idea
for how to create a pure beam of short-wavelength,
high-frequency light first dawned on him as he sat on a
Washington, D.C., park bench among blooming azaleas in the
spring of 1951.

The thought would later turn into a feat that forever changed science, medicine, telecommunications and entertainment.

The revelation led Mr Townes and his students to build a device
in 1954 they dubbed a maser, which stood for microwave amplification by
stimulated emission of radiation.

Four years later, he and a brother-in-law, Arthur Schawlow,
conceived of a variation on that invention to amplify a beam of
optical light, instead of microwave energy, and Bell
Laboratories patented the new idea as a laser.

The scientist died early Tuesday morning while heading to the hospital from his Oakland home, the University of California at Berkeley reported.

Another scientist, Theodore Maiman, was the first to
demonstrate the first actual laser in 1960. 

Lasers use synchronized wavelength of one color of light to create a focused beam in contrast to spread out normal light

But four years
later, Townes shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work
with two Russians, Aleksandr Prokhorov and Nikolai Basov, who
independently came up with the idea for a maser.

Mr Townes went on to pioneer the use of masers and lasers in
astronomy.

With the help of colleagues he became the first to
detect complex molecules in interstellar space and first
measured the mass of the giant black hole at the center of our galaxy, the
Milky Way, which he discovered in 1985.

Mr Townes spent nearly 50 years with the University of California, Berkeley's physics department

An array of laser-based infrared telescopes he built at the
Mt Wilson observatory outside Los Angeles can measure the
diameter of stars that appear as mere points of light in most
telescopes.

"He was one of the most important experimental physicists of
the last century," astrophysicist Reinhard Genzel, director of
the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, said in a
profile of Townes published by UC Berkeley.

A professor emeritus at Berkeley, Mr Townes first came to the university in 1967 and spent time on campus as recently as last year.

He attended Furman University, Duke University and California Institute of Technology, where he studied under renown physicists J. Robert Oppenheimer and Robert A. Millikan, according to the Los Angeles Times.

He worked Bell Labs in New Jersey during World War II before joining the faculty at Columbia University, where he did much of his original work with lasers.

Mr Townes's invention turned out to have roles in a wide range
of technical applications that have become ubiquitous fixtures
of the modern world. 

Incorporated into a broad variety of
consumer electronics and optical fibers, lasers also are used to
cut metal, perform surgery, trap atoms and trigger nuclear
fusion reactions.

Throughout his prestigious work in science, Mr Townes remained deeply spiritual. 

He wrote that instead of religion being separate from science, faith in an orderly universe is what allowed humanity to move 'age of superstition to an age of science'.

In addition to his scientific honours, he won the Templeton Prize in 2005 for advancing knowledge in spiritual matters. Previous winners include Mother Teresa and the Dalai Lama.  

Mr Townes is survived by his wife, four daughters, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. 

Laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.

Electrons enter an excited state after being exposed to energy often in the form of light flashes, which cause them to shift their positions within an atom and emit photons, or light particles.

The emitted light particles are all the same wavelength (meaning they are the same color) and the crests and troughs of the different photon wavelengths all match up to each other.

One photon from an excited atom then triggers more atoms to be excited and creates a larger number of photons, stimulating more emission of radiation.

The atoms and their photons are often trapped inside a tube with two mirrors at the end, keeping the photons bouncing back and forth and making more photons of the same wavelength. 

A small hole in one side of the tube allows some photons to escape, releasing a concentrated beam of colored light.
