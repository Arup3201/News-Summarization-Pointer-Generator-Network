Our first Fantasy Football £1,000 weekly winner is revealed (he's an Exeter fan who got lucky with two Hull defenders)... and here's his team.

It is the craze that seems to have taken over the world - and sports stars in particular seem to have embraced the Ice Bucket Challenge. 

Names including Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and David Beckham have been doused with freezing water in order to raise money for charity.

The Ice Bucket Challenge craze originated in the United States with the intention of raising money for the Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Association.

ALS, also known as Motor Neurone Disease, attacks the spinal cord and can lead to speech difficulties, muscle spasms and paralysis. It affects around 30,000 people in the US and 5,000 in the UK.

Here, we show you the best sporting Ice Bucket Challenges...

CRISTIANO RONALDO

Ronaldo stripped down to his boxers to accept former Manchester United team-mate Darren Fletcher's Ice Bucket Challenge nomination - and then called on musicians Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce and Lil Wayne to join in. 

The Real Madrid forward was soaked by his compatriot Fabio Coentrao while sat on a chair wearing just a pair of purple boxer shorts at the club's training ground at Valdebebas.

NEYMAR 

Barcelona forward Neymar was dared to undertake the freezing challenge by Real Madrid defender Marcelo.

The 22-year-old nominated his 'idol' Robinho, One Direction's Niall Horan and Juan Camilo Zuniga, the Colombian defender that ruled Neymar out of the latter stages of the World Cup with a horror challenge.

LIONEL MESSI 

The Barcelona forward was nominated for it by his team-mate Dani Alves, and he then went on to put forward his international colleagues Sergio Aguero and Ezequiel Lavezzi to step forward next.

DAVID BECKHAM 

Beckham, was nominated by US presenter Ryan Seacrest. And he went on to name former NBA stars Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and actor Leonardo DiCaprio to have a go. 

JOHN TERRY 

The Blues captain managed to thank Ashley Cole and Stiliyan 'Stan' Petrov for nominating him before tipping a bucket of freezing water over his head and letting out a scream that would scare a banshee.

And then the veteran defender nominated Frank Lampard, John Obi Mikel... and Rafa Benitez.

TIGER WOODS AND RORY MCILROY DOUBLE TEAM

The two biggest names in golf dumped ice over one another on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

Ian Poulter nominated Woods, who coaxed McIlroy into joining him.

Four-time Major winner McIlroy nominated former US President George W Bush, Wayne Rooney and model Meghan Markle, whereas Woods challenged Phil Knight and Rafa Nadal.

COLEEN ROONEY (THROWN OVER BY WAYNE ROONEY) 

Wayne Rooney got into the spirit of the 'ice bucket challenge' craze - by soaking wife Coleen.

The Manchester United striker's wife was nominated by Rooney's former England team-mate Shaun Wright-Phillips for the challenge, and after being drenched called upon Piers Morgan and Sheree Murphy - Harry Kewell's wife - to step up next.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE 

Van Persie was soaked by his kids as he sat next to a pool.

The Manchester United forward nominated Patrick Kluivert and Patrick Vieira to take up the challenge next.

GEORGE W BUSH

George W. Bush accepted his daughter's ice bucket challenge Wednesday, but in a hilarious twist his wife Laura surprised him with the face full of frigid water after the former president offered just to write a check. 

He then went on to nominate another former US President in Bill Clinton. 

Chilly challenge: Before the former president could get away with simply buying out of the chilly challenge, his wife Laura sneaked up and douse him in the required fashion

ANA IVANOVIC 

Tennis star Ivanovic took the challenge as she stood in a pink sports crop top.

She went on to nominate Serena Williams, Roger Federer and Bastian Schweinsteiger.

NOVAK DJOKOVIC

Wimbledon champ Djokovic accepted his challenge from One Direction singer Niall Horan.

The Serb then nominated Michael Jordan... and Mr Bean. Really? 

CESC FABREGAS

Among those who nominated Fabregas were former Barca team-mate Gerard Pique and current Blues star Andre Schurrle.

The Spaniard upped the stakes with his nominations, however, with Fabregas electing Thierry Henry and David Villa.

DIDIER DROGBA 

Drogba has been nominated so many times that he could not single out any names!

The Chelsea star elected for Blues boss Jose Mourinho and team doctor Eva Carneiro to undergo the challenge.

RIO FERDINAND 

Sportsmail's Ferdinand took the challenge at QPR's Loftus Road. 

He went big with his nominations - naming Drake, Trey Songz, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Lionel Messi.

JAMIE REDKNAPP AND JAMIE CARRAGHER

Sportsmail columnists Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher have both taken on the 'ice bucket challenge'

Redknapp accepted Kevin Pietersen's challenge, before nominating his father Harry and John Bishop, as well as Carragher who duly accepted.

Carragher then elected for Sportsmail columnist Adrian Durham, Everton chairman Bill Kenwright and ITV host Adrian Chiles to take part.

ANDERSON 

The Manchester United midfielder was nominated by Brazilian compatriot Rafael da Silva, and wasted no time in doing the challenge.

After completing it he nominated team-mates Marouane Fellaini and Shinji Kagawa as well as former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. It's safe to say that particular nomination could well have landed him in serious hot water! 

Soaking: Anderson got a bucket of water over his head from Kagawa and Manchester United staff member

DALLAS COWBOYS CHEERLEADERS

The cheerleaders from the Dallas Cowboys have taken part.

The group performed the challenge after a pre-season game against the Baltimore Ravens.
