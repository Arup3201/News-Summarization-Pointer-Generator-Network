Here is the first photo of the three-month-old baby a Californian woman has alleged was secretly fathered by the pop world's biggest teen idol, Justin Bieber.

Mariah Yeater, 20, is pictured on the cover of U.S. magazine Star with her son, Tristyn Anthony Markhouse Yeater, who was born on July 6.

Here is the first photo of the Californian woman who has alleged was secretly fathered by the pop world's biggest teen idol, Justin Bieber

In news which has stunned the world, the 17-year-old superstar has been named in a paternity lawsuit which she filed on October 31.

Yeater has asked the star to submit to a paternity test, and is asking Bieber 'to provide adequate support for my baby', the result of a tryst she alleged lasted no longer than 30 seconds.

In
a legal statement, sworn under penalty of perjury, Yeater 
told a California court that Bieber propositioned her on October 25 of 
last year, when she was 19 after his concert and at L.A.'s Staples Center.

According to U.S. website Radar Online, Yeater told a judge: 
'When I later realized I was pregnant with Justin Bieber's baby, I tried
to contact him through his representatives but no one ever called me 
back.'

She stated: 'On July 6, 2011, I gave birth to a baby boy. That was 
exactly 36 weeks and two days after the sexual encounter with Justin 
Bieber.

Baby daddy? The singer performed on Dancing With The Stars last night

'Based upon the timing as well as the fact there were no other 
possible men that I had sex with that could be the father of this baby, I
believe that Justin Bieber is in fact the father of my baby.'

Bieber spoke out for the first time since the allegations emerged today.

He took to his Twitter page telling fans that he was choosing to ignore the rumours and rather concentrate on his music.

'So Im [sic] going to ignore the rumours...and focus on what is real an opportunity to help by doing what i love. Judge me on the music! Love yall!' Justin tweeted to his fans this morning.

Bieber's spokesperson has vehemently denied the allegations, and told website Radar: 'While we haven't yet seen the lawsuit, it's sad that someone would 
fabricate malicious, defamatory, and demonstrably false claims.

'We will 
vigorously pursue all available legal remedies to defend and protect 
Justin against these allegations.'

Yeater wrote a detailed statement about 
meeting her idol in papers submitted to a Los Angeles court.

She claims she was approached by a security guard while seated in the front row of the star's concert and asked if she wanted to meet the singer backstage.

She said: 'Immediately, it was obvious that we were 
mutually attracted to one another, and we began to kiss.

'Shortly thereafter, Justin Bieber suggested that I go with him to a private place where we could be alone.

'I agreed to go with him and on the 
walk to a private area, he told me he wanted to make love to me and this
was going to be his first time.

'We went inside and immediately his 
personality changed drastically. He began touching me and repeatedly 
said he wanted to f*** the s*** out of me.

Post show: It has been reported the woman claims she had sex with the underage star when she was aged 19-years-old, backstage after one of his concerts in Los Angeles

'At the time I asked him to 
put a condom on for protection, but he insisted that he did not want to.'

'In his own words, he said that because it was his first time he wanted to feel everything.'

She is said to have described the intercourse as 'brief', lasting 'approximately 30 seconds'. 

However, Yeater's claim that she had sex with the star when she was 19 and he was aged
16 would mean under California law that he 
was underage.

What will Selena say? Justin has been dating his girlfriend for the past ten months

And if the claims turn out to be true
Yeater could lay herself open to a charge of statutory rape of a minor 
and would at least be guilty of a misdemeanour. But she would not have 
to register as sex offender if a conviction was upheld.

Yeater
claims that after the encounter he refused to give her his phone 
number, and was 'not interested' in writing down her contact details.

She
says that after learning she was pregnant she tried to get in touch 
with him via his representatives, but there was no response to her 
calls.

A court hearing is said to have been set for December 15.

Out and about: Selena Gomez also stepped out tonight despite the rumours and attended a charity event in L.A.

Justin
has been dating girlfriend Selena Gomez since the end of last year but 
the couple waited until the Oscars in March to make their first public 
debut together.

Last month when the couple were both 
in Winnipeg and they spent an amorous evening watching the basketball  
together and were seen smooching from a private box.

They also adopted a dog together, whom they have named Baylor, from an
animal rescue centre in Winnipeg on October 14.

Bieber continued his professional duties last night in the wake of the claims with a performance on Dancing With The Stars.

Gomez also stepped out with a red carpet appearance at a charity event in Los Angeles.

In
February this year Justin, who is a Christian, spoke out about 
pre-marital sex in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine.

He said: 'I
don't think you should have sex with anyone unless you love them.'
