Prepare to be dazzled! 

A drone has captured an over-the-top Christmas light display in Virginia that outshines all of the neighbors.

Photographer Daryl Watkins sent a remote-control aircraft over Al and Esther Thompson's home on Wendhurst Drive in Richmond to get a bird's-eye view of their festive abode.

The couple started collecting twinkling decorations in 1999 and now their impressive collection is made up of more than 170,000 bulbs in all the colors of the rainbow.

Hard to miss: A drone has captured a giant Christmas light display in Virginia 

Obsession: Al and Esther Thompson started collecting twinkling decorations in 1999 after being inspired by local Christmas light switch on

Tourist attraction: Every year people from all over the world flock to see the lights

Aerial footage shows the Thompson residence lit brightly as the sun goes down.

Other houses in the area look lifeless in comparison.

Then as the night sky plunges into darkness, the light show really comes into its own.

Pedestrians are seen soaking in the illuminations from street-level.

This year's display apparently took 537 hours to put up.

The Thompsons said they were inspired to start decorating their home after going to a local Christmas light switch on event more than a decade ago.

Now the annual event has become somewhat of an obsession. 

The Thompson's lights are switched on every day at 5:30pm with New Year's Eve being the last day of operation.
