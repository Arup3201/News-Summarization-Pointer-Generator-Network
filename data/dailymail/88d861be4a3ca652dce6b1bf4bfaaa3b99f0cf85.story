Labour MP Keith Vaz yesterday warmly greeted migrants arriving from Romania and Bulgaria – before calling for a referendum on free movement within the European Union.

Mr Vaz, the influential chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the British people needed to decide if the rules which allowed free-flowing migration across the continent should be changed.

His comments came as controls on migrants from the two impoverished Eastern European countries lapsed at midnight on New Year’s Eve.

As he greeted migrants at Luton airport, Mr Vaz said: ‘The British people need to decide if you are changing something like freedom of movement. At the end of the day it has to be a referendum.’

He told Sky News: ‘It needs to be part of negotiations for a reformed EU, because freedom of movement is very important.

‘It’s one of the cornerstones of the EU and we need to have a proper discussion, and that means at the end of the day the British people have to make that decision.’

From yesterday, citizens of both Romania and Bulgaria could move freely to Britain and have full access to jobs in this country.

The reluctant Romanians roped in for the greater glory of Keith Vaz looked as baffled as all the rest of us

This has prompted fears of a rush of migrants similar to that seen in 2004, when eight Eastern European countries joined the EU.

Critics have warned a new surge in 
migrant numbers will put further pressure on hard-pressed public 
services, including schools and hospitals.

They have also questioned whether more workers from abroad are needed at a time of high youth unemployment in the UK.

Ministers have refused to predict how many new arrivals will come – but have downplayed suggestions of a huge increase.

Mr Vaz was joined by a senior committee member, Tory Mark Reckless, at Luton airport.

They met Victor Spirescu, 30, who said he planned to initially wash cars in Britain, before moving into construction.

‘I don’t come to rob your country. I come to work and then go home,’ he said.

‘I
 don’t want to stay here. I want to renovate my home and to make a good 
life in Romania because it’s much easier to live in Romania because it’s
 not expensive.’

Mr Reckless warned that an increase in Romanian and Bulgarian numbers could mean Tories miss their immigration target.

David
 Cameron has pledged to cut net migration – the number migration adds to
 the population each year – from around 250,000 a year in 2010 to below 
100,000 by 2015.

Currently it stands at 182,000.

Mr
 Reckless said: ‘I’m here this morning because my party – the 
Conservatives – made a promise that we would cut immigration from 
hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands a year.

'And my concern is 
that if we do see large numbers coming from Romania and Bulgaria then 
that could knock us off that target and the promise we made to the 
electorate.

‘I think it’s 
essential we meet that promise and control immigration.

'I think we 
really need to judge whether in order to do that will require us to 
leave the European Union and to control our own borders.

‘Ultimately I think that’s the choice that the country will face in a referendum.’

Mr Cameron refused demands from 90 Tory backbenchers for the controls to be extended for a further three years.

A
 Daily Mail poll found that 80 per cent of the public favoured extending
 the controls, and a majority backed the move even if it would leave 
Britain facing extensive fines.

The
 Prime Minister has pledged a referendum on EU membership by 2017 if the
 Tories are in power, and is the only party leader to promise a vote.

New arrivals: Fellow member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Tory Mark Reckless was also there to meet the 7.40am flight from Tirgu Mures

Immigration
 Minister Mark Harper said the transitional controls were kept for the 
‘longest extent possible’.

He added: ‘If you’re here from the EU and not
 working, not studying, not self-sufficient then we can remove you and 
you won’t be able to come back for at least a year.

‘I
 think those changes will make sure people are coming here for the right
 reasons, to work and to contribute and not to claim from our benefits 
system.’
