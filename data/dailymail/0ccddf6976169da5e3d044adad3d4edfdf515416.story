The best way to keep a marriage happy is to sleep in the nude, a study suggests.

Those who wear nothing in bed are more content in their relationships than those who cover up, according to a poll.

Of 1,004 Britons, 57 per cent of those who sleep in the nude said they were happy in their relationships, compared with 48 per cent of those in pyjamas, 43 per cent of nightie wearers and 38 per cent of those in onesies.

The findings of the poll for Cotton USA will be good news for many, since four in ten of us now sleep naked, and almost half - 45 per cent - of over-55s do so.

Stephen McKensie, 33, from Portsmouth said: ‘I have been sleeping in the nude for six years now and it’s so much more  comfortable than wearing  pyjamas or boxer shorts.

‘My wife does it too, and we have never been happier. It helps you relax when you’re in bed.’

Stephanie Thiers-Ratcliffe, of Cotton USA, said: 'There are many factors which can affect the success of a relationship.

'But one factor which is often overlooked is the bedroom environment.

'Bedding can feel extremely soft against the skin, encouraging openness and intimacy between couples and ultimately increasing happiness.'

The research also revealed our partner’s bedroom manners affect our happiness in relationships.

Half of us are bothered by people eating in bed, 59 per cent of us detest dirty washing on the floor and 23 per cent hate it when their partner wears socks in bed.
