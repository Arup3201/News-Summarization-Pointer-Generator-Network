Longest-serving: Kay Burley marked her 28-year 
television career by claiming her longevity proves older women can still
succeed on the small screen

Newsreader Kay Burley has marked her 28-year television career by claiming her longevity proves older women can still succeed on the small screen.

The 52-year-old Sky News broadcaster has been on camera for a total of 20,000 hours and is the longest-serving British news presenter still working.

Speaking at the Breast Cancer Care lunch at Champneys Tring health spa, she said: ‘I’m 53 in December and I’ve just signed another five-year contract, so I think that probably blows a few holes in the argument of people who say that older women can’t be a success in television.

'I’m the longest-serving British newsreader. That’s quite a lot of longevity, isn’t it?

‘I was staggered, to be honest … and apparently I’ve also done more live broadcasting than anybody else in the world.’

‘Apparently there is some chap in America who’s done about 16,000 hours and apparently I’ve done 20,000 hours. Isn’t it amazing? It’s incredible. I can’t believe it.

‘It feels like yesterday that I joined the company. I suppose it’s because it doesn’t feel like work because I love my job, I love what I do for a living.

‘I’m not expecting a trophy, I’m just safe in the knowledge that I can continue to do for another five years the best job in the world. I love my job and I’m very lucky and privileged to be able to do it.

‘I’m very content to be with Sky. I was there when it was just great big potholes in the car park, and now we have something like 130 million viewers around the world. I was recently on safari on holiday and I was recognised on the Zimbabwe/Botswana border, which was a bit weird but it made me think, “We reach all of these people”.’

At a Breast Cancer Care lunch she hit back at critics such as Sir Terry Wogan, who last week claimed ageing female presenters should not complain when they are replaced as they often use their looks to land TV roles as young women.

Miss Burley, who admits making a series of high-profile blunders during her live broadcasts, recently signed a new contract which will keep her at Sky until she is 57.

'It feels like yesterday that I joined the company': And she has just signed another five-year contract

She began her career on the Evening Post and Chronicle in Wigan in 1978 before working in local radio and television.

She
joined TV-am in 1985 as a reporter and breakfast TV presenter. She 
joined Sky News in 1988, helping launch the channel three months later.

She
currently presents Sky News from 2-5pm, and has covered some of the 
world’s biggest news stories including the death of Princess Diana, the 
Asian Tsunami and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, for which she won a BAFTA 
award.

George, this summer

However, she made a series of widely-publicised gaffes during her career, including mistakenly mocking US Vice President Joe Biden for marking his forehead with ashes on Ash Wednesday.

She told viewers it looked like he had ‘walked into a door’.

She grabbed a photographer by the throat during the scrum that greeted Naomi Campbell’s court appearance in 2008, and was labelled ‘a bit dim’ during a clash with Labour MP Chris Bryant.

She said: ‘I’ve had so many bloopers 
I’ve no idea where to start. There’s a great quote that goes “Doctors 
bury their mistakes, lawyers lock theirs up, and television presenters 
broadcast theirs”, and it’s true.

‘Of
course you make mistakes. You can’t be the longest-serving newsreader 
in the world and not make mistakes, but the key is to get back on the 
horse’.

Talking about ageism
in the past, Miss Burley admitted she had never been a victim, but said
she would follow former BBC presenter Miriam O’Reilly, who successfully
sued the BBC for age discrimination and victimisation after she was 
dropped as a presenter of Countryfile at the age of 51 in 2009.

She said: ‘Ageism and sexism have passed me by - but if it happened, I’d fight it like Miriam O’Reilly did.’

Talking about retiring from television, she once admitted: ‘I sometimes dream of a life in the country with my chickens, growing vegetables. That would be heaven one day, but not yet.’

Britain’s longest-ever serving newsreader is Peter Sissons, who retired from the BBC at the age of 66 in 2009 after 31 years as a newscaster.

Before him, the title was held by Dickie Baker, who retired from the BBC after 28 years.
