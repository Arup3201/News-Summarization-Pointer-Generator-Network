Where do the rich and famous stay when they're planning a getaway on the shores of Lake Geneva?

Michael Jackson, Richard Branson, Rihanna and Bill Gates have all enjoyed stays here, the world's luxurious hotel suite - a snip at only £52,000 a night.

The Royal Penthouse Suite of the President Wilson hotel in Geneva, Switzerland, is believed to be the most expensive hotel suite in the world.

Surely you're not spending all this money just to watch TV? Nevertheless, the President Wilson hotel's Royal Penthouse Suite comes with an impressively sized Bang & Olufsen flat-screen to stare at

For the musical types: Pop stars Rihanna and Michael Jackson may have also run their fingers across the keys of the Steinway grand piano found i the Royal Penthouse Suite's second living room

Yum yum: As befits a suite with 12 double bedrooms, the suite also includes this immense dining table, with views across Lake Geneva towards the Swiss capital. A butler is included in the price...

Decision time: Business leaders like Richard Branson and Bill Gates may have held important meetings in here, the suite's 'royal boardroom'

And now time to unwind: With a game of billiards - which is pool for posh people

Occupying the entire eighth floor of the hotel and spanning a massive 18,000 sq/ft, it boasts panoramic views overlooking the Lake Geneva and the Alps as well as a built in gym and jacuzzi.

Perfumes emanate from the wardrobes of the 12 bedrooms - each with an en-suite bathroom - and guests can either play billiards or have a tinkle on the Steinway grand piano for entertainment.

And after a hard day seeing the sights of the the Swiss capital they can relax with the Bang & Olufsen BeoVision flat-screen TV and audio installation - or simply admire their sumptuous surroundings.

A hotel spokesman said: 'No matter where one looks, an oeuvre d'art is for contemplation. Should it be an art deco vase; a prestigious painting, or a Persian carpet, each object has been chosen for its unique value.'

But that's not all, the staggering price also includes a private butler, chef and security team, who are placed at the beck and call of guests, who in the past have included Hollywood stars like Matt Damon and Michael Douglas.

Well appointed: The Royal Penthouse suite is sumptuously decorated in a traditional European style

One of many paintings hanging on the walls: 'No matter where one looks, an oeuvre d'art is for contemplation. Should it be an art deco vase; a prestigious painting, or a Persian carpet,' a hotel spokesman boasts

Security conscious: The entrance to the suite, which is guarded by surveillance cameras here and in the corridors, as well as steel lined entry doors, making it a firm favourite it a firm favourite with heads of state

Another relaxing spot: The royal living room of the suite, enjoyed by the likes of Prince Albert II of Monaco, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak...  and Tony Blair

A fine view: The balcony of the suite has a fine view at dusk, as this picture shows, and guests can also peer out at anything happening on Lake Geneva with the telescope made available for them

What really sets the Royal Penthouse suite apart is its range of tight security features that have made it a firm favourite with such heads of state as Prince Albert II of Monaco, former Soviet leader Gorbachev and Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak.

Former British prime minister Tony Blair, now a jetsetting global diplomat and consultant to major investment banks, has also enjoyed a stay there.

To allow VIP guests to feel completely safe there are surveillance cameras in the corridors and at the entrance of the suite, as well as steel lined entry doors, periphery walls and bullet proof glass windows.

This is where the magic happens... The Royal Penthouse Suite's roual bedroom, with its panoramic views of the magnificent Lake Geneva only interrupted by... another television

And this is where they get clean afterwards: The master bathroom, with its immense marble bath tub

Height of luxury: For those who regard the 'royal bedroom' as below them, here is the 'imperial bedroom'

A lesser bathroom: Again with marble tub and with chilled bubbly on hand... but be careful drinking in the bath!

There are also magnetic contacts outside the suite which can detect if there is an intrusion and the two main bedrooms have panic buttons which are linked to the hotel's security.

And if all that wasn't enough, there is a human-sized armoured safe which has its own security system and key.

If you wish to experience the extravagance of the world's most expensive hotel suite, it will set you back 75,000 Swiss Francs per night.

However, since it has 12 double bedrooms, a prospective guest could potentially club together with 23 others and pay just £2,166 each... a night.
