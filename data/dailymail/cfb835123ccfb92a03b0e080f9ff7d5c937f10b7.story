A law enforcement official says he sent a video of Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee to an NFL executive five months ago, while Commissioner Roger Goodell has insisted the league didn't see the violent images until this week.

The person played The Associated Press a 12-second voicemail from an NFL office number on April 9 confirming the video arrived. A female voice expresses thanks and says: 'You're right. It's terrible.'

Hours after the report on Wednesday, Goodell announced former FBI director Robert S Mueller III will conduct a probe into how the league pursued and handled evidence as it investigated claims against Rice.

NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in a statement that the investigation will be overseen by owners John Mara of the New York Giants and Art Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Goodell said that Mueller will have access to all NFL records and will have full cooperation from league personnel.

The law enforcement official, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, says he had no further communication with any NFL employee and can't confirm anyone watched the video. 

The person said he was unauthorised to release the video but shared it unsolicited, because he wanted the NFL to have it before deciding on Rice's punishment.

The NFL has repeatedly said it asked for but could not obtain the video of the Baltimore Ravens running back hitting Janay Palmer - who is now his wife - at an Atlantic City casino in February. 

The league says it has no record of the video, and no one in the league office had seen it until it was released by TMZ Monday. When asked about the voicemail on Wednesday, NFL officials repeated their assertion that no league official had seen the video before Monday.

'We have no knowledge of this,' NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. 'We are not aware of anyone in our office who possessed or saw the video before it was made public on Monday. We will look into it.'

Goodell, who was supposed to attend an award ceremony for Panthers owner Jerry Richardson in Charlotte on Wednesday night, did not attend the event and instead changed his plans and headed back to New York.

The law enforcement official said he sent a DVD copy of the security camera video to an NFL office and included his contact information. He asked the AP not to release the name of the NFL executive for fear that the information would identify the law enforcement official as the source.

Goodell initially suspended Rice for two games following the February incident, but the Ravens released Rice on Monday and the NFL suspended him indefinitely after TMZ released the video.

Goodell told CBS on Tuesday that 'no one in the NFL, to my knowledge' had seen a new video of what happened on the elevator until it was posted online.

'We assumed that there was a video. We asked for video. But we were never granted that opportunity,' Goodell said.
