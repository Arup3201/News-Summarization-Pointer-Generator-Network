Protecting his name: Sabrina Fulton filed a patent application for the phrases 'I am Trayvon' and 'Justice for Trayvon'

The mother of slain Trayvon Martin recently filed a trademark to protect the rights to his name as an attempt to control- and collect funds from- the masses of merchandise being produced in support of their cause.

It was revealed today that Sabrina Fulton, the boy’s mother, filed two petitions last week to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to specifically gain the rights to the phrases ‘I Am Trayvon’ and ‘Justice For Trayvon’, both of which have been frequently used by protesters across the country.

The trademark application shows that she is specifically looking for control of the use of those phrases on CDs and DVDs that feature her deceased son.

Interestingly, the application makes 
no mention of other merchandise that may use those phrases, and t-shirts
 and hoodie sweatshirts are notably absent from the listing, meaning 
that she would not collect any monetary payment if someone were to sell 
clothes with those words on them.

A
 wide variety of t-shirts, pins, buttons and banners are being sold in 
Florida and have been ever since the fatal shooting of 17-year-old 
Trayvon Martin became a national issue, flaring fraught racial tensions 
throughout the state and the country.

The sale of merchandise has sped up in 
recent weeks, and will likely continue strong as rallies continue to be 
held in Sanford, Florida, where the incident occurred on February 26.

Demanding answers: Ms Fulton (center) and her ex-husband Tracy Martin (pointing) appeared in a Sanford, Florida city hearing on Monday as the push for action continues

Calling for action: Supporters have made a plethora of different t-shirts, all with the same essential message

Shirts with the phrases that Ms Fulton just trademarked are available for sale online for $20 to $25 each.

Most of the t-shirts call for the 
arrest of the teen’s shooter, George Zimmerman, though one that was 
revealed on Monday goes a step further.

Local
 rapper Plies was photographed in a t-shirt with ‘P***Y A** CRACKER’ 
surrounding a photo of Zimmerman, using a lyric from one of his songs 
about a judge who gives large sentences to black defendants.

Other
 t-shirts chose to stick to the facts of the case, saying that the teen 
only had a pack of Skittles and a bottle of iced tea on him at the time 
of the altercation.

Some, 
including former NAACP leader C. L. Bryant, feel that the attention 
surrounding the case has turned it away from the actual issues at hand 
and created a circus around the tragic death of a child.

Specifically
 Reverend Bryant called out Reverends Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson for 
exploiting the case to increase their own profiles.

Continued fight: The family's lawyers arranged a large march through Sanford on Monday with many supporters wearing t-shirts with the slain teen's image

Wearing the message: Shirts and hoodies honoring Trayvon are available for sale throughout Florida and the U.S.

‘His family should be outraged by the 
fact that they’re using this child as the bait to inflame racial 
passions,’ Mr Bryant told The Daily Caller.

He added that the two famed community leaders are ‘acting as though they are buzzards circling the carcass of this young boy’.

The
 trademark application was handled by a different team of lawyers than 
the ones representing Ms Fulton and her ex-husband Tracy Martin.

Kimra
 Major-Morris and Natalie Jackson were the two lawyers from the Orlando,
 Florida firm The Women’s Group who filed the application.

Exploitive? One former NAACP leader says that the Reverends Al Sharpton (center) and Jesse Jackson (right) are exploiting the pain of Trayvon's parents (Ms Fulton on the left and Mr Martin on the right)

It cost $325 to file each of the patent and trademark applications, and it does not specify how much Ms Fulton stands to make off of each time someone violates the trademark.

Ms Fulton's lawyer, Ms Major Morris, told the Associated Press that the money that will be gathered from the trademark will go to 'projects that will assist other families who experience similar tragedies'.

She denied that Ms Fulton had any intention of profiting from the move.

The legal team handling the trademarks are completely separate from the firm of Parks and Crump who are representing the family and collecting donations from the public for their legal fees.

Over the weekend, Trayvon’s parents urged supporters to make sure they were not donating to a string of fake sites that claim to be associated with the cause, but instead only give to those at Parks and Crump.
