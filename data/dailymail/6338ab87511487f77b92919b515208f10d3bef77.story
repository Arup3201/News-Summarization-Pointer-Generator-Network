Beverly Hills in one of the the richest zip codes in America, but the overall poverty rate in California is now the highest in the country, new U.S. Census Bureau figures show.

The Golden State’s poverty rate is a whopping 23.5 percent – higher than the District of Columbia, at 23.2 percent, and even Florida, and 19.5 percent.

California’s shockingly high number came after the Census Bureau changed how it measures its data.

For years statisticians have based poverty rate calculations on the cost of food – but over the years this methodology has drawn increasing criticism.

The Census Bureau wasn’t getting an accurate picture of poverty rates because it didn’t take into account tax rates and assistance programs such as food stamps, child care expenses and medical costs, according to the Huffington Post.

The most recent figures released last week include such data – what the Census Bureau calls ‘supplemental poverty measure.’

The new metrics have shot California’s poverty rate sky high.

In recent years the state came in at about 16.3 percent.

‘We're seeing a very slow recovery [nationally], with increases in poverty among workers due to more new jobs which are low-wage,’ University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Timothy Smeeding told the Associated Press.

‘As a whole, the safety net is holding many people up, while California is struggling more because it's relatively harder there to qualify for food stamps and other benefits.’

California’s jump between the supplemental and conventional measures was the largest swing of any state, and the Sacramento Bee attributes it to the state’s high cost of living.

‘There are several important differences between the official and supplemental poverty measures,’ Census Bureau economist Kathleen Short said in a statement.

‘For instance, the supplemental measure uses new poverty thresholds that represent a dollar amount spent on a basic set of goods adjusted to reflect geographic differences in housing costs. The official poverty thresholds are the same no matter where you live.’

Under the supplemental measures, the national poverty rate jumped by a full point up to 16.1 percent, or just under 50 million individuals.

The poverty rate for minors dropped from 22.3 percent down to 18.1 percent, while the rate for seniors (ages 65 and above) nearly doubled to 15.1 percent.
