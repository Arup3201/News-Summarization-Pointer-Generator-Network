If you think winning at bingo or the lottery is simply down to chance, think again.

Lucky people tend to have similar features, according to new research, which also shows you'll have a better chance of winning if you live in Stoke-on-Trent.

A bingo firm studied the facial features of winners across the country and discovered that many of them shared characteristics which they then built into one 'lucky' face for each sex.

Female winners look like the mocked-up face on the left, while male winners resemble the man on the right

Women who win tend to share the same face shape as Olympic hero Jessica Ennis, and mouths like Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet.  They also have hair like Dame Helen Mirren, eyes like singer Adele, and a nose like Kate Moss.

Male winners tended to have faces shaped like dancer Louis Smith, hair like Daniel Craig, and a beard like that worn by business mogul Alan Sugar.  Having Simon Cowell's smile, Alan Carr's nose, and David Beckham's eyes will also give you a better chance, apparently.

The data from Gala Bingo also shows that the luckiest age is 37 for women and 58 for men while the luckiest region in the UK is Central Scotland, followed by the South West and Lancashire.

The luckiest town in the UK is Stoke-on-Trent.

Alison Digges, director of Galabingo.com, said the firm decided to study the facial features of winners when they realised they often looked similar.

She added: 'We’re well used to seeing the fantastic expressions on our members’ faces when they realise they’ve won.

'It’s a real perk of the job to be a part of the smiles and laughter and tears of joy.'
