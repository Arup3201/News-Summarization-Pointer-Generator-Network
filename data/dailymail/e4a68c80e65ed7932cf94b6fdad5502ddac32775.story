You could travel to work reading a magazine or chatting on your mobile at the wheel, before leaving your car to park itself, in Volvo’s vision of the future, which centres around autonomous cars.

The Swedish auto giant is set to unleash 100 self-driving cars onto the streets of Gothenburg in 2017 in a large scale experiment designed to take robotic cars a step closer to accident-free driving.

The cars use sensors, cameras and GPS to analyse the traffic around them so they can navigate the roads – and other less diligent drivers – safely.

You could travel to work reading a magazine or chatting on your mobile at the wheel, before leaving your car to park itself, if Volvo's vision of autonomous cars becomes a popular reality

The company claims it is the first large-scale autonomous driving pilot project on public roads that will see if the technology can cope with everyday driving conditions in a bustling city.

Self-driving cars will use approximately 37 miles (50 km) of selected roads in and around Gothenburg, which have been identified as ‘typical commuter arteries’ and include motorway conditions and roads with frequent traffic jams.

‘Our aim is for the car to be able to handle all possible traffic scenarios by itself, including leaving the traffic flow and finding a safe “harbour” if the driver for any reason is unable to regain control,’ said Erik Coelingh, Technical Specialist at Volvo Car Group.

The self-driving technology used in the pilot scheme will allow people to hand over control to the car when circumstances are appropriate.

The vehicles – adapted from the new Volvo XC90 – which will be used in the experiment, can handle all driving functions from steering and braking to parking.

The car will be able to park itself, without the driver inside it, allowing someone to ditch their car at the entrance of a car park to let the vehicle go through the tedious task of finding somewhere to park.

Endorsed by the Swedish government, the ‘Drive Me’ project aims to explore the societal benefits of autonomous driving, from fewer accidents to less stressful journeys to work.

Håkan Samuelsson, President and CEO of Volvo Car Group, said: ‘Autonomous vehicles are an integrated part of Volvo Cars’ as well as the Swedish government’s vision of zero traffic fatalities. This public pilot represents an important step towards this goal.’

‘It will give us an insight into the technological challenges at the same time as we get valuable feedback from real customers driving on public roads,’ he added.

Experts will look at infrastructure requirements for autonomous driving, customers’ confidence in the technology and how ‘real’ drivers interact with an autonomous vehicle on the road.

‘The public pilot will provide us with a valuable insight into the societal benefits of making autonomous vehicles a natural part of the traffic environment.

‘Smart vehicles are part of the solution, but a broad societal approach is also necessary to offer sustainable personal mobility in the future, said Mr Coelingh.

Volvo said autonomous driving will pave the way for more efficient time-management behind the wheel so that people can interact safely via phone or tablets (pictured) or choose to relax on the way to work

The project will begin next year with customer research and technology development and the first cars are expected to be on the roads in Gothenburg by 2017.

Volvo envisages that drivers in the future will be able to plan their drive with a mixture of autonomous and active driving to make their daily journeys more efficient.

They believe autonomous driving will pave the way for more efficient time-management behind the wheel so that people can interact safely via phone or tablets or choose to relax on the way to work.
