Wine could become too expensive for anyone but the wealthy thanks to Government restrictions and taxes, says one major retailer.

A potential ban on multi-buy offers in supermarkets and the recent 10p rise in wine duty could be responsible for drinkers turning to beer instead, according to Stephen Lewis, the chief executive of Majestic Wine.

This could reverse the 'revolution' of people enjoying a glass of wine with a meal, he said.

A potential ban on multi-buy offers by the Government could lead people to abandon wine for cheaper drinks, says one retailer

'Having established this culture of food and wine, you know, which is a sea change from where we were 30 years ago, why would we want to stop that?' Mr Lewis, whose chain has nearly 200 stores in the UK. told the Daily Telegraph.

He said that banning drinks offers in supermarkets would not solve the problem of anti-social behaviour.

'The Majestic consumer is not the person who’s smashing up things, they’re not the problem drinkers', he told the newspaper.

Yesterday, the minister for public health indicated a decision over introducing minimum alcohol pricing may never be taken, despite it being backed at first by David Cameron.

Public health minister Anna Soubry said minimum alcohol pricing may never be introduced

Anna Soubry said the policy could seem like 'big bossy government cracking down on people who don't have a problem', in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

She said the Government was yet to decide if it would introduce a 45p minimum unit price and possibly never would.

Reports emerged last month that the controversial plans had been ditched amid claims David Cameron had run into fierce opposition from Cabinet colleagues, including Home Secretary Theresa May.

The Prime Minister insists the Government is considering the outcome of a consultation and wants to act to curb cheap drink.

Ms Soubry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'On alcohol, I don't think we have actually made a decision yet and there are good arguments both in favour of it and against it.

'I was not convinced. I have been convinced because I met a whole load of liver specialists and doctors and they persuaded me it was a good idea.'

Asked if she had convinced Mr Cameron, she replied: 'Oh yeah.'

Asked when there would be a decision on alcohol pricing: 'I don't know.'

When presenter John Humphrys said: 'In other words we may not?', she replied: 'We may not.'
