A Tasmanian man who made his millions off professional gambling has listed one of Australia's most lavish penthouses for a mind boggling $16 million.

David Walsh, who built Australia's acclaimed Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) gallery in Hobart, has listed the ritzy Darlinghurst pad with agents Ballard Property. It is situated on the top floor of the Harry Seidler-designed Horizon building, and offers an incredible 360 degree view of the Sydney skyline.

According to its agent, the whole-floor residence with more than 580 square metres of space is 'without doubt the biggest and most impressive penthouse in Sydney.'

The apartment, owned art collector David Walsh, is listed for sale for $16 million with a Sydney based agent and comes with more than 580 square metres of space

Included among the grandiose designs of the modern interior is a home theatre, marble bathrooms, wine cellar,

A professional gambler and philanthropist, Mr Walsh made millions from a high stakes betting syndicate that won $17 million on the 2009 Melbourne Cup

'This is undoubtedly the best view I have seen in my 58 years as a Real Estate Agent.' selling Billy Bridges said.

The property is described as 'world-class,' a residence with 'exceptional layout and first-class facilities' that offer the ultimate home and corporate office suite in the very heart of Sydney.

It has a private lift foyer which opens in to the more than 586sqm apartment, housing a sequence of living areas and a dedicated accommodation wing wrapped in breathtaking views over the harbour and city.

Outside on the balcony is Seidler's signature wave-shaped terrace that features high-end custom finishes. Among the grandiose designs of the modern interior is a home theatre, marble bathrooms, wine cellar and Crestron Home Automation. There is also parking for six cars and state-of-the-art security.

If your looking for somewhere to sleep you can choose between one of four bedrooms, including a large master with en-suite. There is also an enormous dine-in kitchen, boardroom and caterer’s kitchen.

Along with paying the price for its plush interior, the willing buyer will also get to snap up some acclaimed pieces of art which Walsh is leaving to the apartment's new owners. It is understood their is a watercolour tryptich by John Olsen and a large contemporary oil painting by Sydney artist Michael Johnson hanging inside.

If the price is right for Walsh, and he sells it for $16 million, it will be just $1 million shy of an incredible windfall he was involved in as part of a betting syndicate which won $17 million on the 2009 Melbourne Cup.

His gambling pursuits over the years, however, landed him in hot water with the Australian Taxation Office when he was told to pay $37 million back to the ATO because of the money he made from gambling.

The outstanding debt was resolved in 2012.

The MONA, or Museum of Old and New Art,  opened in January 2011 as and won the 2012 Australian Tourism Award for best new development

There is four bedrooms in the penthouse, including a master with en suite and own balcony that has views across to the city
