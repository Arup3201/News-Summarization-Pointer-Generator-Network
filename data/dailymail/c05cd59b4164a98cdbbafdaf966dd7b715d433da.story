Tony Gilchrist, 35,  who opened a scuba diving business in the Philippines has been shot dead on the island where he lived

A British man who opened a scuba diving business in the Philippines has been shot dead on the island where he lived.

Tony Gilchrist, 35, was reportedly shot four times in the chest and twice in the head, allegedly by a security guard whom he had dismissed for turning up late for work after a drinking session.

The shooting happened on Saturday at Fish Buddies, a scuba diving shop owned by Mr Gilchrist on the island of Malapascua.

Mr Gilchrist, originally from Staines, west London, had thrown himself into distributing thousands of pounds worth of aid raised in the UK following Typhoon Haiyan which destroyed parts of the Philippines five months ago.

His brother James, who travelled to the island with another brother, Stephen, told MailOnline: 'Tony was a kind, gentle soul with a huge heart. He cared deeply for his family and friends. He truly didnâ€™t have a bad bone in his body.

'After Typhoon Yolanda, he displayed his compassion by staying and helping the locals on Malapascua, for weeks he drove a bus back and forth to Cebu to buy much needed aid for the local people whom he loved.

'By the time the main aid agencies arrived the community was already making headway to getting back on their feet due to the fortitude my brother displayed.'

Mr Gilchrist is said to have worked in local government in Hounslow, west London, as well as being a bus driver, before moving to the Philippines.

His alleged killer was named in local news reports as 42-year-old Melchor Alciso Jr from Hinundayan, Southern Leyte, in the Philippines.

Mr Gilchrist's brother told MailOnline: 'We met with the chief state 
prosecutor in Cebu this morning. They have a very strong case and have 
brought charges of murder, their highest possible charge.

'It carries a 
sentence of 40 years. It is our families hope that justice be served in a
 timely fashion and hope the British government assist by keeping us 
fully informed throughout the process.'

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Malapascua Island on the Philippines on Saturday April 19.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'
