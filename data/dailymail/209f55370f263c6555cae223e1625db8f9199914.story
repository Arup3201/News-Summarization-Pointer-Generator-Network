An argument over a woman led to the stabbing murder of a man inside a busy Sydney shopping centre, police will allege.

Kazem Mohamadi Payam, 35, appeared in Parramatta Local Court on Tuesday morning, charged with the murder of Nabil Naser, 40, inside the crowded shopping centre in western Sydney.

Police alleged the two men had arranged to meet at the complex to discuss the woman.

Payam did not apply for bail on Tuesday and it was formally refused.

The matter was adjourned to July 24.

Outside court, his lawyer Georgina Namat said Payam would defend the charges.

'We are not applying for bail today but we will be applying for bail soon,' she said.

'We will be defending the charges.'

A crying female supporter rushed out of court after Payam's appearance.

On Monday morning, shoppers watched in horror as a man repeatedly stabbed another man to death at Westfield shopping centre in Parramatta, western Sydney, before finally leaving the knife lodged in the 40-year-old victim's chest which killed him.

Police have described the fatal stabbing on Monday morning as a 'targeted attack' involving two men who knew each other.

They believe the two men had decided to meet at Westfield Parramatta to discuss the woman.

A photo from the scene shows a topless man surrounded by four police officers in front of a taped off escalator.

The incident took place in front of shoppers, including children and parents on their school holidays, outside a Myer store's cosmetic department on level four.

A 33-year-old man, believed to be Iranian, was arrested and taken to Parramatta Police Station, police have confirmed. He reportedly taunted the police, saying 'what are you scared of?'.

A witness wrote on Twitter that a man was stabbed and the perpetrator was 'stripped topless, on floor in cuffs'.

Another witness, who did not want to be named, told AAP the attacker appeared to be taunting police officers at the scene.

'He kept plunging the knife in his chest, in and out, and paced up and down the shopping centre screaming at police,' he said, adding that the man was stabbed three to four times.

The man eventually left the knife in the man's chest before police moved in to arrest him.

The witness said the knife looked to be about 30cm long and the ordeal lasted about 20 minutes.

'Everyone was very scared and begging for somebody to stop the attack,' he said.

Emily Newton saw one of the witnesses of the attack being treated by ambulance staff

'She was in complete shock and had to be escorted out on a gurney,' Ms Newton said of the witness who was taken away on the stretcher

Police arrived 'and a lot were in bullet proof vests', a witness said. A man has been arrested and taken to Parramatta Police Station, police have confirmed

'There was blood everywhere.'

A Myer employee, Bianca Zoratto-Ivanov, told the Sydney Morning Herald her friend saw the stabbing.

'He heard a scream, like a man yell. He heard it again and then he heard two young women scream: "He's killing him! He's killing him",' she said.

Zoratto-Ivanov's friend, an employee at Aquila Shoes, claimed a machete was used during the attack.

'The man had a big machete,' she said.

Police said the two man had some kind of 'exchange' before the stabbing 'directly outside Myer store on level 4'.

'It could be very confusing but this was a targeted attack and only involved two individuals,' acting superintendent Jennifer Scholz said in a press conference on Monday afternoon.

She said the incident unfolded 'very quickly' and Westfield security intervened.

Police are looking into whether the stabbing was over a girlfriend. 'That is one lead we are following up,' Act Supt Scholz said.

'The man has a chest wound to his chest,' she confirmed of the attack, which she said she described as 'obviously distressing'.

She said the attacked was 'one-off and not bikie-related' and that 'there is no need for anybody to be concerned about their safety'.

A male witness told Channel Nine news: 'I've ever seen anything like it in my life to tell you the truth and never want to see anything like it again.'

Emily Newton, who was leaving the Myer store when the incident happened told MailOnline staff tried to 'discretely escort' them out of the store.

Reports claim the suspect remained in the shopping centre after stabbing the victim and awaited the arrival of police

'We were walking to our car out of the Myer exit and had to turn around. Within about two minutes stores began closing and customers were not told what was happening. They security taped off most of levels 3, 4 and 5.'

She said the police arrived 'and a lot were in bullet proof vests'.

'We hadn't been told anything that was going on. The centre was inundated with police and customers became visibly confused, anxious and concerned.

'Staff were quick to get customers to keep walking away from the police tape,' she explained.

Ms Newton also saw one of the witnesses of the attack being treated by ambulance staff.

'She was in complete shock and had to be escorted out on a gurney,' she said.

She said there was a lot of confusion inside the shopping center 'and no communication to the public with what was happening'.

Cafe worker Paulo Agcaoili told The Daily Telegraph he saw the man being attacked with a big knife 'like a machete'.

A Westfield worker also reportedly told the paper the attacker 'looked calm for someone who had just killed someone'.

Meanwhile, shopper Amanda Elliot, told MailOnline: 'I didn't see much other than doors closing when I was in Myer, so I left via level 5 and everyone was hanging over the balcony above.

'I saw the cops cuffing the topless tattooed stabber on the floor and telling another guy to stop moving, he was walking very agitated carrying a jacket or bag or something.'

She also saw 'security and police telling everyone to move back'.

Ms Elliot added: 'A couple of Myer staff were visibly distressed having witnessed it.'
