Underground heat from a supervolcano combined with high summer temperatures have melted a section of asphalt road in Yellowstone National Park, forcing the closure of some areas.

The 3.3-mile-long Firehole Lake Drive was closed on Monday after the park's ever-changing thermal geology created a 'hot spot' which turned the road into 'oatmeal'.

As they examined possible fixes, park 
officials warned hikers to avoid the area as the 
danger of stepping through solid-looking soil into boiling-hot water was
 high.

'There
 are plenty of other great places to see thermal features in the park,' 
Yellowstone spokesman Al Nash said. 'I wouldn't risk personal injury to 
see these during this temporary closure.'

Yellowstone spans portions of Idaho, Montana and 
Wyoming in America's north-west.

The melted road is off Grand Loop Road between Old Faithful and Madison Junction in the park's Lower Geyser Basin, which takes visitors past Great Fountain Geyser, White Dome Geyser and Firehole Lake. Access to these areas has been closed.

The same heat that feeds the geysers softened the pavement too much to drive on.

'It basically turned the asphalt into soup,' park spokesman Dan Hottle told USA Today. 'It turned the gravel road into oatmeal.'

Naturally changing thermal features often damage Yellowstone's roads and boardwalks. Steaming potholes in asphalt roads and parking lots — marked off by traffic cones — are fairly common curiosities.

However, the damage to Firehole Lake Drive is unusually severe and could take several days to fix.

Unusually warm weather for Yellowstone — with high temperatures in the mid-80s — has contributed to turning the road into a hot, sticky mess.

'We've got some ideas. We're going to try them. Our maintenance staff has really looked at the issue,' Nash said.
