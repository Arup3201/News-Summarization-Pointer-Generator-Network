A father bidding to be a Ukip MP has been barred from taking his children to its meetings by a judge who warned they were at risk of ‘emotional damage’.

At a custody hearing held behind closed doors, she told the candidate many people do not like the party, leaving the youngsters at risk of witnessing hostility from opponents.

The judge told the family court hearing in the South of England that her fears included the possibility of somebody throwing something at the youngsters.

The father, who cannot be identified, said he was asked if he would undertake not to take his children to party events. After he refused, he said the judge made an order to stop them being involved in any political activity.

Last night, the dad said he felt ‘stigmatised’ and claimed the judge had been ‘blinded by prejudice’ towards his party.

‘I feel deeply insulted,’ he said. ‘I have been treated like a criminal. A parent should be allowed to bring up their child using common sense and not have that interfered with by a judge.

‘I was astonished during the discussion about my children’s holidays when the judge became animated on hearing they had attended Ukip meetings.

‘The judge made several remarks that I regarded as anti-Ukip and asked if I would undertake not to take them again. Of course I refused. She claimed the children were at risk of “emotional damage” if they attended Ukip events.

‘She went on to pass an order banning me from taking them on political activities.’ The candidate said the judge told him there are a lot of people with very strong feelings about Ukip including many who are ‘dead against’ the party.

‘She told me my children could be exposed to hostile reactions that could cause emotional harm,’ he added. ‘I was gobsmacked.

‘This is not based on any law, but a judge’s politically correct view. All political parties have gatherings, they all do street stalls, have public events, a lot of children go on marches with protesters.

‘There are hundreds of politicians and party members up and down the country taking children to political events all the time. I cannot see why I have been singled out.’ The father said the order ‘seems to be motivated by the judge’s distinct prejudices against Ukip and perceiving it as a hazard’.

He added: ‘The judge seemed to think people are very angry about Ukip as if there’s something wrong with it. I find that very belittling. We’re a mainstream political party.

‘Millions of people support Ukip. How can she imply that these people are on an extreme fringe and that I am taking children into a dangerous situation? It’s absurd.

‘I see this as an attack on normal family life and on Ukip. I know I have not done anything wrong but am being treated with contempt.

‘It is interfering with how I bring up my children. Parents should be left alone to bring up their family according to common sense.

‘We are told what to do, what to think and how to run our lives. I am deeply concerned.’

Today at an appeal hearing the father will argue that hostile behaviour and foul language are more likely to be experienced at football games than during campaigning.

He will challenge the order on the grounds that it interferes with his right to family life by unnecessarily impeding how he chooses to bring up his children day-to-day.

The father said his youngsters had attended party events like rallies and joined him as he took part in campaigning such as leafleting.

But he insisted he would never take them to anything where he thought they were at any risk.

‘I’m careful with my children, what they eat and where they go. I’m a good parent,’ he said.

‘My children are wonderful and adorable and I’m always mindful of them. There has been no incident where I showed a lack of common sense. There was nothing untoward. I would never take my children to anything hazardous or pressurised where they would feel uncomfortable. If you are out with your children, you are always vigilant.’

Two years ago, a couple in Rotherham had their three much-loved Eastern European foster children taken away on the grounds their membership of Ukip meant they supported ‘racist’ policies.

■ Ukip leader Nigel Farage has asked for a police bodyguard for the election campaign. A source said he is being subjected to ‘physical and verbal abuse’ by protesters. Officials will assess his request.
