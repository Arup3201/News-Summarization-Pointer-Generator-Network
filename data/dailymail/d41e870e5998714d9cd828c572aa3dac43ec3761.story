A top bloke: Melbourne University student Joshua Hardy died in hospital after being kicked to the head by two men outside a McDonald's restaurant early Saturday morning

Mr Hardy, originally from Darwin, lived with his younger sister at the university's Trinity College in Parkville. He was a popular footballer who played on Trinity’s premiership-winning team this year and had just returned from a trip to Europe, the Herald Sun reported.  He has been described as a role model in the university’s indigenous community. 

 'RIP Joshua Hardy you were a close friend, a great friend and even a brother to me, words cannot begin to explain how sad I am to hear of such a nice guy being taken so soon,' wrote friend Anak Agung Gede Surya on Facebook.

'Genuine bloke, glad I met you' posted Aakash Amy from Darwin. 

A primary school friend, Shaun Hutchinson, wrote that he was devastated to lose 'an absolutely top bloke, true mate (and) one of the few people in this world that could bring a smile to all ... From knowing you as a young lad in primary school to exploring the city of Madrid recently, I am glad to have called you a mate and have had the pleasure of getting to know you,' reported the Herald Sun. 

Meanwhile, Trinity College said in a statement today it was deeply saddened by the news.

'Joshua came to Trinity in 2012 and soon became loved by all for his prowess on the footy field, his mentoring skills (he participated in the AIME mentoring program), and his community-mindedness. Josh was a wonderful student and brother whose sudden passing is a tremendous shock.' 

The Melbourne man charged with murder will face an out of sessions hearing overnight.

Victoria Police reported that 27-year-old Zandipour handed himself in to the St Kilda Road Police Station this evening. 

According to police, the incident was unprovoked and the suspects quickly fled the scene. 

Detective Sergeant Sol Solomon said the victim was standing outside the McDonald's store when a fight allegedly started between the victim and two other men aged in their 20s who had just bought food.

'He was grabbed by the arm and violently thrown to the ground head first, and then kicked to the head,' Det Serg Solomon said. 'He lapsed into unconsciousness immediately.' 

He urged anyone who knew the men or had information on the incident to come forward. 

Customers in the McDonald's outlet reportedly went to Mr Hardy's aid. He was taken by ambulance to the Alfred Hospital with critical injuries but died an hour later.

'It's yet another violent, senseless assault occurring on a public street in Melbourne late at night,' Det Serg Solomon said.

Police say the victim was well dressed in a black suit and shirt at the time of the attack, but was not carrying any identification. There was no indication that he knew his attackers.

'There appears to have been a discussion leading up to the assault. We're not aware what words were exchanged,' Det Solomon said.
