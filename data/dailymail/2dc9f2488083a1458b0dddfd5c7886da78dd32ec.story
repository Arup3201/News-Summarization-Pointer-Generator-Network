Caz and Craig Makepeace, the professional adventurers behind YTravel Blog, describe themselves as 'serial travel addicts'.

The couple, who originally hail from the Central Coast in NSW, said that they like to 'call the world their home', having lived in five countries and visited a staggering 52. 

Caz Makepeace listed Kakadu National Park, in the Northern Territory as one of their absolute favourite spots in the country.

'A national park that offers spectacular waterfalls, gorges, Aboriginal rock art, and an abundance of wildlife and natural beauty,' said Caz.

'Stay a while and soak up its spiritual essence,' she advised.

The pair are also a fan of Mudgee, a town in the central west of NSW, about 250 kilometres away from Sydney.  

'What's not to like about the country charm of a town that has wide streets, heritage buildings, amazing food, craft breweries and wineries you can easily cycle between?' asked Caz.

The town is well-loved for it's plethora of bed and breakfast establishments, and has an ever-growing winery selection to sweeten the deal.

Bright, northeast Victoria: The stunning  parkland beside the Ovens River during Autumn

Springtime is just as beautiful in Mudgee which boasts festivals all year round, and is a hotspot for paragliding and hang gliding

The unusually named Bright, in northeast Victoria makes the cut for as well.

A beacon for activity despite a small population, Bright boasts the annual Autumn Festival and frequent paragliding and hang gliding festivals. 

'You can't beat a summer in the high country of Victoria,' said Caz.

'Spend your days cycling through the valleys and then cooling off in the rivers that run through it after. This region has some of Australia's best craft brews!'

The list gets historical with the Town of 1770, in Queensland. 

Built on the site of Captain James Cook's second landing, the town holds a re-enactment of the momentous event each year. 

Caz describes 1770 as a 'sleepy and quiet town that brims over with stunning landscapes, amazing beaches, nearby reefs and plenty of adventure.'

Broome, Western Australia: The popular tourist destination triples in population during the peak period

'It offers the best mix of everything that is special about Australia: a rich indigenous culture with wonderful Aboriginal art at galleries dotted around town; the world's finest stretch of sand at Cable Beach,' Lara says

Lastly, the travel enthusiasts list Broome as a must-see.  

In the Kimberley region of Western Australia, the town is a popular tourist destination, growing from a population of 15,000 to 45,000 in peak season. 

'It’s the exotic flavour of Asia, mixed with the rugged Australian outback, and the chilled out Aussie beach living,' said Caz.

'It's also a great base to explore one of Australia's most incredible regions: The Kimberley.' 

Lara Dunston, one half of the well-loved Grantourismo Travel blog, also lists Broome as a 'must-see'.

'While it's no secret, of course, it always surprises us how few Australians get here; more Aussies have probably been to Bali than to Broome,' said Lara.

'Broome offers the best mix of everything that is special about Australia: a rich indigenous culture with wonderful Aboriginal art at galleries dotted around town; the world's finest stretch of sand at Cable Beach,'

'Fantastic seafood to be feasted at good local restaurants, washed down with local brews; an Asian flavour thanks to Broome's fascinating history; and ruggedly beautiful landscapes and natural attractions on the doorstep.' 

Kuranda, Queensland: The butterfly farm (left) and Barron Falls (right) are two gems to visit in the tropical rainforest of Atherton Tablelands

Kuranda is only 25km from Cairns and can be reached by a scenic railway 

James Clark, the mastermind behind Nomadic Notes, calls himself a 'digital nomad', fueling his love for travelling into several travel businesses, as well as his blog.

A location independent entrepreneur originally from Melbourne, James has been living as a digital nomad since 2003. 

The 'perpetual traveller' said that while a lot of visitors to Northern Queensland are drawn to explore the Great Barrier Reef, he would recommend making a side trip to Kuranda.   

'While it is only 25km from Cairns it feels like another world away,' he said.

'Kuranda in the tropical rainforest of the Atherton Tableland and it feels cooler and less humid than sea-level Cairns.'

'The most memorable way to arrive is by the Kuranda Scenic Railway.'

The Aussie Nomad, aka Chris Richardson, recommends the Grampians, in Victoria.

The Grampians in Victoria: 'With varying degrees of hiking trails and waterfalls to see it can be a great escape for a family to get away, see a kangaroo or emu and just enjoy the views,' said Chris Richardson (Mckenzie Falls pictured)

Mckenzie Falls look as idyllic as a postcard and is certainly well worth swimming under

Robe, South Australia: Stunning turquoise water, beaches for miles and a really relaxed vibe to the town. What more can you ask for when looking at a summer getaway?' Chris asks

On Chris's expansive list is Robe - a spot where he and his loves ones have holidayed 'for as long as I can remember'

The ex-pat has been exploring the world since 2010, but said he thinks the enormous national park is a must for those looking to explore 'what mother nature gave us'. 

'With varying degrees of hiking trails and waterfalls to see it can be a great escape for a family to get away, see a kangaroo or emu and just enjoy the views,' said Chris.

'I can highly recommend McKenzie Falls if you are looking for a swim under a waterfall. There's even a small shop at the top to grab a drink or ice cream on a hot day.'

Chris said he started off a budget traveller, but said he views travel as the 'ultimate investment,' something that he encourages people to 'invest in often and in large amounts'.

On Chris's expansive list is Robe, in South Australia, a spot where he and his loves ones have holidayed 'for as long as I can remember.'

'It was only after I visited for myself did I understand the appeal of it. Stunning turquoise water, beaches for miles and a really relaxed vibe to the town. What more can you ask for when looking at a summer getaway?'

The Pinnacles, Western Australia: 'A strange sight are these limestone formations just poking out of the sand,' Chris says

Visiting The Pinnacles is best done early in the morning or late in the afternoon when the sun's golden hours emphasise the colour and shape of the mystical formations

Sunshine Coast Hinterland, Queensland: Bangalow Palms is one of the many amazing places to explore

The Aussie Nomad said that the Sunshine Coast has more to offer than just well-known Noosa, including bush walking the Kondalilla National Park and wandering through the hinterland

Robe is a distinctively historical town, with a tiny population of just over 1000, in stark contrast to his next recommendation- Queensland's Sunshine Coast.  

'When talking of the Sunshine Coast many immediately think Noosa and well you can't fault them for that, it's a beautiful place to relax,' said Chris.

'The greater Sunshine Coast area however has a lot to offer. Be it a romantic getaway near the Glass Mountains, bush walking through the Kondalilla National Park and hinterland of the Sunshine Coast or just taking in a market or two like the Eumundi Markets,' he said.

'It's a great area to take the car on a road trip and explore.'

Exploring seems to be the key to the Aussie Nomad's heart, listing The Pinnacles, about two hours north of Perth, in Western Australia, as his next pick. 

'A strange sight are these limestone formations just poking out of the sand,' said Chris.

'Visiting them is best done early in the morning or late in the afternoon as the sun's golden hours emphasise the colour and shape of these mystical formations.'
