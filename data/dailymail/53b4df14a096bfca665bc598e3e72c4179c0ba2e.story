Obama made the  comments at the dedication of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, which pays tribute to injured veterans, both living and dead, who have served in former conflicts.

During the ceremony, Obama said the memorial would commemorate two centuries of Americans who have left behind loved ones to serve, before returning home forever altered by war.

According to the Washington Post, he told more than 3,100 people, many in wheelchairs or with lost limbs: 'It is America's sons and daughters who bear the scars of war for the rest of their lives.

'America, if you want to know what real strength is, if you want to see the character of our country, a country that never quits, look at these men and women.

'Over decades, our nation has worked to do better, to do right by these patriots. Those who have fought for our freedom, should never be shunned, should never be forgotten.'

The 53-year-old politician added: 'When our wounded veterans set out on that long road of recovery, we need to move heaven and earth to make sure they get every single benefit, every single bit of care that they have earned, that they deserve.'

The granite-and-glass memorial opened as the U.S. disentangles itself from more than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, where around 50,000 military personnel have been injured in conflict.

In recent months, Obama has grappled with the rise of Islamic State militants now wreaking havoc in Iraq and neighboring Syria.

Today, Obama admitted the nation has not always fulfilled its obligations to those who serve, calling it a 'painful truth'. He said he hoped the memorial would remind the U.S. of its debt to its veterans, some of whom have had to re-learn how to walk and talk.

'This memorial is a challenge to all of us, a reminder of the obligations this country is under. If we are to truly honor these veterans we must heed the voices that speak to us here,' he said.

The president, who  came into office vowing to end wars but authorized military action against ISIS in Syria last month, continued: 'Let's never rush into war'.

'It is America's sons and daughters who bear the scars of war for the rest of their lives. Let us only send them into harm's way when it's absolutely necessary,' he said.

The group first started work on creating the memorial in the late 1990s.
