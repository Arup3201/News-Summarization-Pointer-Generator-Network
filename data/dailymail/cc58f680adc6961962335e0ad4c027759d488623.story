Zlatan Ibrahimovic, hit or myth against the English? The Swedish motormouth with the jumbo-sized talent and an ego to match says he has no intention of ever playing in this country.

Perhaps that has something to do with Ibra’s scoring record against English club teams.

Chelsea fans might like to grasp hold of these statistics and pray that the trend continues in Paris tonight.

Ibrahimovic has played 15 times for five different clubs against English sides. He has seen a total of 1,310 minutes match action but scored just THREE times.

Breaking that down, the world-class forward only nets once every 437 minutes against Premier League opposition. Also, it helps if the opposition is Arsenal.

All three goals have come against Arsene Wenger’s teams, a double in 2010 for Barcelona and the other for AC Milan in February 2012.

It would be fair to say that Ibra has under-achieved, pretty much from the moment he faced Arsenal as a fresh-faced kid for Ajax in 2003.

Four meetings with Liverpool in 
Juventus and Inter shirts have drawn a blank, ditto two fixtures against
 Manchester United, and two games against Tottenham.

At the double: Ibrahimovic netted twice for Barcelona away at Arsenal in the 2010 Champions League

Getting used to them: The Swede notched against the Gunners in 2012 while at AC Milan as well

Rich vein of form? The enigmatic striker has scored three in his last five games against English opposition

After 10 matches without a goal, Ibrahimovic will argue that he is on a roll with three in the last five.

He may not have had the goals to showcase his sublime skills but Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is adamant that the player he had at Inter would be a huge asset to the Barclays Premier League.

Ibra says no. But England loves a mean, moody, larger-than-life character who can play a bit. Think Eric Cantona, think Carlos Tevez, think Luis Suarez.

Hero or villain, football fans throughout the country would love to see another big, controversial personality strutting his stuff on the domestic stage.

Wishful thinking! Jose Mourinho claims it was a pity that the player never plied his trade in the Premier League

Sadly, at the age of 32, the clock is ticking down on Ibrahimovic’s peak years. Even he has suggested that this might be his last chance for Champions League glory.

Having said that, he has been in awesome form this season. His total of 40 goals is a club record at PSG and he has netted 10 times in seven Champions League appearances, including four against Anderlecht.

Finally, and Chelsea supporters might like to look away now, Ibrahimovic certainly has no problems with the England national side. 

Go back to November 2012. Four goals, including the 2013 goal of the year with that bicycle kick.
