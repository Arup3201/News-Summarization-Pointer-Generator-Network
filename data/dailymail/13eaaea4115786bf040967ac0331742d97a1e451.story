Fog and cloud across the UK has left hundreds of travellers stranded this morning for a second day in a row.

Fog affected flights and train journeys as Britain was cloaked in a light fog, but the Met Office said that they were not issuing a severe weather warning as the impact was not widespread.

The poor visibility led to a slew of disrupted flights both inbound and outbound across airports in London and the south east.

London City Airport, has to cancel 83 flights today and 212 flights yesterday because of the weather, and Heathrow Airport in west London  were forced to cancel 54 flights today and 147 flights yesterday.

A spokesman for Heathrow said: 'Fog 
and low cloud mean there’s reduced visibility for pilots and air traffic
controllers at Heathrow.

'Drivers
have to leave extra space in these conditions and aircraft are no 
different, which makes it impossible to maintain Heathrow’s normal 
pattern of a plane landing or taking off every 45 seconds. 

'Because
Heathrow is full, operating at more than 99 per cent of permitted 
runway capacity, there are no gaps in the schedule that can be used for 
delayed flights.

'Unfortunately that makes some cancellations inevitable.

'There are also some delays and cancellations being caused by an air traffic control strike in France. 

'To put that into context, we have approximately 1,300 flights a day.

Heathrow Airport suffered because of the cloak of fog, but the Met Office said the weather did not warrant a severe weather warning

'We’re sorry for the disruption caused to our passengers and have teams in the terminals to help anyone who needs to rebook.'

Stansted remained open and operated all flights, despite the adverse weather conditions.

A spokesman said: 'We actually took in an additional 34 diverts from other airports, mainly City, Luton and Southend on Monday.'

On the railways, there were delays to 
CrossCountry and South West Trains (SWT) services in Hampshire due to a 
broken-down freight train in the Eastleigh area.

SWT
passengers also had to contend with delays due to a broken-down train 
at Beaulieu Road in Hampshire which led to hold-ups between Southampton 
Central and Brockenhurst.

A signalling problem between Saxmundham and Woodbridge in Suffolk delayed passengers travelling with Greater Anglia, with buses replacing trains between Ipswich and Saxmundham.

On London Midland, passengers were warned to expect possible cancellations due to train crew shortages, while First Great Western services were affected by a broken-down train at Greenford in west London.

On the Underground, there were delays during the rush-hour to Metropolitan and Jubilee line services due to a faulty train at Wembley Park in north west London.

A spokesman for the Met Office said: 'It's mostly misty, cloudy and drizzling. Temperatures are up to 16 degrees and will stay pretty much the same for tomorrow, with lots of cloud.

'There was a severe weather warning yesterday through until this morning. As visibility is not limited to 200 metres and there is not a wide impact, we have not issued another one.'

Foggy days: The Met Office said the weather should clear by the end of the week

Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: 'Fog arrived in Monday’s early hours with worst-affected South-East parts not seeing visibility higher than 300 metres during Monday, with fog remaining widespread through Monday night before clearing to mist on Tuesday and returning on Tuesday night in the Midlands and South-East.

'The fog has had nowhere to go as it was trapped under low clouds with no change of air mass.'

The poor weather came as thick mist caused havoc yesterday, forcing flights to be cancelled across the UK's airports.

The affects of the heavy fog was felt
across Europe, including in Poland where planes due to land at Warsaw 
airports were redirected to neighbouring cities or were forced to wait 
for the fog to temporarily dissipate before landing, airport authorities
said.

The Met Office 
issued a 17-hour severe weather alert in the 
South, Midlands and North of England as visibility dropped to 50metres on 
hills because of the fog.

Famous
skylines across the capital were totally obscured by the thick fog, but
the weather is expected to warm up before a cold snap greets the 
country by the end of the week.
