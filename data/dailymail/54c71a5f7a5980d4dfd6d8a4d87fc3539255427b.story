Wayne Rooney nearly scored one of the strangest goals ever seen in Miami on Monday night, slotting home after a mishit long-range cross from Ashley Young despite the ball hitting the stanchion... NOT the crossbar.

Just after the hour mark, Rooney 
slotted home past Simon Mignolet, who had not made an effort to stop the ball, 
before the England striker celebrated with an embarrassed look on his 
face.

Out: The ball clearly hits the stanchion before bouncing out towards Rooney to slot home

Referee Mark Geiger initially gave the goal, despite the ball having hit the stanchion of Mignolet's goal, not the crossbar.

Then, the
 referee consulted his linesman, before ruling the goal out. There 
were no complaints from United's players as Mignolet resumed the game.

It is not certain whether the linesman may have seen one of the replays on the big screens inside the Sun Life Stadium in Miami, but replays showed the ball had clearly gone out of play just behind the goal before bounding back into Rooney's path.

‘I don’t think the other goal was going to be given so I was pleased with one, and with the result,’ said Rooney after the game. 

The game ended 3-1 to United, with Rooney scoring from an angle to equalise for United in the second-half. The striker was also named Player of the Tournament after the match.
