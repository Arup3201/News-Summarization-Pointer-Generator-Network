Clive Palmer has been slammed by social media users after publicly urging Prime Minister Tony Abbott to commit suicide.

During a press conference at Parliament House, the outspoken crossbench MP was commenting on Mr Abbott's claim that Mr Palmer was preventing his senators voting in favour of the government's higher education overhaul.

'There’s a million students going to tertiary education in this country, there’s a million more that’s about to go, and a million more that’s just left, they’ve all got parents,' Mr Palmer told reporters.

'So commit suicide Tony Abbott, you know,' the Palmer United Party leader said, as he chuckled.

Mr Palmer tweeted an apology soon after his comments were broadcast, to set the record straight

When challenged as to whether the comment was a respectable point to make, Mr Palmer said that it was not a debate and clarified that he had meant 'political' suicide.

'It's suicide, political suicide to go against the will of what's good for the Australian people,' he said.

His comments have garnered criticism on social media, with Twitter users labelling the statement flippant, horrific, appalling and sickening.

'I'm stunned an elected official, paid by taxpayers, thinks it's OK to invite the PM to kill himself,' tweeted one social media user.

'Such an idiot. Watch your words Clive,' said another.

One Twitter user suggested renaming the MP 'Facepalmer', another tweeted that 'regardless of intent, it's an absurd statement.'

Mr Abbott has not commented on Mr Palmer's statement

Mr Palmer tweeted an apology soon after his comments were broadcast, to set the record straight.

'Today I inadvertently used the term suicide in regard to Tony Abbott when I meant political suicide. I apologise for any offence caused,' Mr Palmer wrote.

One Twitter user backed the MP, urging social media users to 'calm down' as Mr Palmer intended the comments to refer to political suicide. 

Mr Palmer has made light of mental health issues in public comments before, including an incident in 2013 when he told Queensland Premier Campell Newman to 'take his medication and calm down'.

The PUP leader referred to Mr Newman as 'a nice little fellow with a bipolar condition (who) sometimes doesn't take his medication'.
