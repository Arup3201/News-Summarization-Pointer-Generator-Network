Violent crime: Vincent Kershaw was found dead on his kitchen floor with injuries to his head and unpacked bags of shopping around him

An elderly widower was found battered to death at his home after revealing he had a secret hoard of paintings by LS Lowry.

Retired wagon driver Vincent Kershaw, 84, told neighbours about the stash of valuable works at his home in Milnrow, near Rochdale, shortly before he was found dead in his kitchen.

Mr Kershaw, who had been friends with the iconic artist in the 1950s, was known for carrying large wads of money with him and drove a silver BMW sports car.

The pensioner was found dead at home last Sunday, when police alerted by a tip-off broke into 
his house and found his body in the kitchen surrounded by his 
shopping bags which had still not been unpacked.

Detectives fear he was followed home from a supermarket and may have been lying dead for up to ten days.

It
was initially believed that Mr Kershaw could have died from natural 
causes but further tests showed he had died from fatal head injuries.

Greater Manchester Police have been examining his home to establish what items may be missing.

He had lived alone at the £80,000 semi since his late wife Bridget was admitted to a nursing home suffering from Alzheimers disease. She died earlier this year aged 83.

Neighbour
John Ingham, a bricklayer, 51, said: 'Vincent was a nice fellow. He and
Bridget had no children together but they were very devoted to each 
other and lived in the house for about 50 years.

Hoarder: Mr Kershaw had told people about his paintings by iconic artist LS Lowry, who was famous for atmospheric views of his beloved Manchester. It is not known which works the 84-year-old owned

'After she was admitted to the care home he would go and see her every day. I last saw him a couple of weeks ago when I was bringing in my washing, he was looking okay, a bit frail and was shuffling about but he was still okay for his age.

'I got back from a car boot sale on Sunday afternoon and the street was full of police and forensics and then in the evening two ambulances came.

'I’d gone into my house and I can see into his and saw him lying on the floor between the living room and the kitchen. It was a terrible scene.'

He added: 'I do wonder whether Vincent 
was targeted. He always carried a lot of money with him, hundreds, maybe
even thousands in his pockets and he was a bit of a bugger for flashing
his money.

'He didn’t drink or smoke and didn’t have any home help, he would do all his own shopping. He used to drive but he got his licence taken away - I think it was because he was getting on.

'He was a mechanic before he retired and before that he said he was a wagon driver and used to pick up coal from Barnsley.

'One day he was showing me these pictures, he said, "have a look at these". I knew they were Lowry but I thought they were only prints and wouldn’t be worth anything.

'They were like what you’d pick up at a car boot sale.

'But then I was speaking to him again and he pulled me to one side and said that in the 50s he used to pick up the coal from the factories over near Barnsley when there was no motorway.

'His lorry had broken down and he’d gone to this house and it turned out to be the home of Lowry. From then on he used to stay there three times a week. He said that Lowry had given him an original painting.

'Vincent said he did have some prints but that he did have an original, I don’t know what it was but I had no reason to doubt him.'

Neighbour Angela Burleigh, 45, said: 'He was a lovely old man and would always stand at his gate, I think he knew what times people were coming and going and he always gave you all the gossip. He knew everything about everyone because he was a long standing resident.

'The thing is you wouldn’t know if there was anything wrong because he always used to keep his curtains shut. He used to say to me, "I keep my curtains closed because I have got lots of valuable artwork and I don’t want anyone to see".

'He’d never tell me what they were. I don’t know if he was rich but he used to have a silver BMW sports car.'

Another neighbour John Platt, 61, added: 'He was his own character and liked to do things his way. He was always very smartly dressed and visited Bridget in the home for quite a few years before he died.

'I thought he had died of natural causes but the police are now saying it’s suspicious.'

A mother of two who did not give her name added: 'Apparently they found him on the kitchen floor with head injuries and he still had his shopping in the bags from the local Tesco.

'The receipt had said it was the 4th October when he did his shopping. I think he’d got the bus to the shops, it’s only about 10 minutes away in Milnrow village.

'Apparently he’d been found with a piece of the kitchen unit in his head, his door was unlocked but his keys were in the back of the door. He hadn’t even unpacked his shopping and his wallet was missing.

'He was quite a feisty character, I think they are thinking someone followed him from the supermarket.'

Detective Chief Inspector Alistair Mallen said; 'We cannot say if anything was missing from the house as he was a bit of a hoarder. He picked up his pension from Milnrow Post Office on October 4 at approximately 10am and we know he carries a lot of money.

'We have not found the wallet but we have got to go through the house and search.

'We know he went for his pension and then at 1pm went to Tesco Express to get his groceries.

'On Sunday at 5.10pm we received a call a concern for his welfare as some of his neighbours had not seen him for a while.

'He was a fiercely independent chap who lived here on his own, his wife passed away in July. He looked after himself, was well dressed, got out and managed his own affairs.'

Lowry, who lived Mottram in Longdendale, near Hyde, was renowned for giving out original paintings as gifts to wellwishers.  The famous artist died in 1976.
