Ben Pierce was born so prematurely doctors didn't think he would survive.

With a fighting spirit he pulled through, but his eyes struggled to fully develop.

A surgery restored his sight, but it left scar tissue, which will continue to grow as he does.

Now nine, the Dallas boy will eventually lose his sight completely, doctors believe, but they don't know when, according to The Daily News-Miner. 

Determined to make the most of the time he has left, Ben, encouraged by his parents, Kit and Heidi, started drafting a Bucket List of the things he wanted to see, before he can no longer see.

On top of one of the Seven Wonders of the World: Ben Pierce, 9, who is slowly losing his sight, was granted a wish to see the Northern Lights in Alaska by Alaska Airlines

Breathtaking: Even though Ben's sight is fading, he was still able to grasp the marvel of the Northern Lights during the trip this week

Amazing: The mysterious curtain of colors caused by gas particles increasing their speed and density while stirring within the Earth's magnetic field

The Eiffel Tower, the Egypitan Pyramids, the Apple store in Dallas and a sunny Los Angeles beach were some.

However coming from a family of six, not all would be possible.

The one that stood out on the list where the Northern Lights in Alaska, the mysterious curtain of colors caused by gas particles increasing their speed and density while stirring within the Earth's magnetic field.

Amazingly, visiting this seventh wonder of the world became possible thanks to the kindness of a complete stranger.

Chris Cice, who works for Alaska Airlines as a pilot, was told about Ben's condition and his list by daughter, who had heard about it at school.

Cice passed the story on to some bosses at the airline, who decided they wanted to help also. 

Premature: Ben was born so early that doctors didn't believe he would make it. He pushed through, however his sight has been slowly worsening as he has gotten older

Alaska Airlines then gave Ben, his parents and five siblings free return tickets to Fairbanks, Alaska, to see the Northern Lights, The News-Miner reported.

And so on Thursday, the Pierce family touched down and checked into the Chena Hot Springs Resort.

At midnight they were woken up by a guide and taken up a trail to the Northern Lights vantage point.

Despite his fading vision, which sometimes him to use a magnifying glass to read, Ben was able to make out the show that was happening above him.

'It's really beautiful and pretty,' Ben told KTUU, gazing up at the lights.

Happy: Among the other things on Ben's 'bucket list' are the Eiffel Tower, which his family hopes to visit sometime next, as well as the Pyramids in Egypt and the beaches of Los Angeles

'It's like water colors going across the sky.'

The Pierce family already have another trip book.

They will soon go to Turner Falls, Oklahoma, to see Native American dancing, and plan to visit London and Paris next year, KTUU reported.

Ben's journey to the Northern Lights was documented by photographer Ronn Murray.
