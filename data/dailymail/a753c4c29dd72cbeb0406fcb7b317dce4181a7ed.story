Aston Villa are hoping to conclude a £3.9million deal for Valenica's Carles Gil with the attacking midfielder flying into Birmingham on Monday.

The 22-year-old is seen by Paul Lambert as a player who can add variety to his goal-shy team. He is 5ft 7in, a fine dribbler, and possesses an ability to go past opponents. Carlos Sanchez was a team-mate at Elche.

Wages are not expected to be an issue and Villa hope to wrap up the transfer this week.

Aston Villa have made a £3.9m bid for Valencia's Carles Gil, who has made 11 appearances this season

Villa have scored just 11 goals in 21 Barclays Premier League games - the lowest total in England's top four divisions - and lost 1-0 at Leicester on Saturday to draw their fourth straight blank.

Afterwards, Lambert confirmed his desire to add more flair to his squad.

Lambert said: 'We have to keep working hard, we need a bit more creativity. That's the only thing that is lacking from us. That's the disappointing thing.

'Money certainly helps but we will work within our way of working. Whether people cost £9million or not you have to get the best out of it.

'Randy (Lerner, chairman) has been really good, we talk every couple of days. No doubt we will have chats after the weekend.'
