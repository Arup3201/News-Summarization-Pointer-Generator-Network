New home: Farnborough International Airshow is 
home to a breeding pair of black redstarts, who have made a nest in a hospitality chalet

With the deafening sound of jet engines and the commotion caused by hundreds of thousands of visitors, it seems an unlikely place to bring up your brood.

But Farnborough International Airshow is home to a breeding pair of black redstarts, who have made a nest to care for four chicks in the roof of a hospitality chalet.

The birds, so rare that they are protected by law, stunned wildlife experts when they were found nesting at the festival in Farnborough, Hampshire.

Organisers were due to take down the 
chalet when the show finished last week, having attracted 227,000 
visitors and seen the sale of aircraft worth £46billion.

But they decided to leave it up for an extra two weeks to avoid disturbing the chicks, which are only two weeks old.

Experts believe there are only about 40 black redstarts in the country.

Keith Betton, of Hampshire Ornithological Society, said the birds were brown with a red tail and a little bigger than a robin.

'Black redstarts are one of the ten rarest birds in Britain and a delight to watch,' he added.

'They have a tendency to nest in unusual places such as power stations and building sites but their new home is equally bizarre.

'This breeding pair have found a little hole in the side of a chalet and set up home for their chicks despite the bustling crowds and noisy aircraft.

'Once you are aware the birds are nesting it is a criminal offence to disturb them so the airshow have to leave them in peace.'

Mr Betton has seen the breeding pair leaving the nest and returning every three or four minutes, collecting small insects to feed to their chicks.

Airshow spokesman Philippa Ewart said the birds had nested in a chalet hired by The Blades aerobatic team.

The chalet, which was put up in March, contains a kitchen, reception and lounge/dining area.

Ms Ewart said: 'We don't know 
precisely when the birds occupied their chalet but we only found out 
about their existence last week.

'On
average 60 people per day are hosted in a single unit. Then the flying 
displays begin, which are incredibly noisy with the Vulcan aircraft and 
other fast jets displaying on a daily basis.

'The birds seem totally unfazed by all the activity around them.

'They regularly pop in and out to feed the young chicks, which we believe to number four.

'I guess the parents got used to the daily activities around the show as it built up.

'Once the chicks were hatched I understand the bond is strong enough that the adult birds will not leave them.'

Ms Ewart said the chicks would probably be ready to leave the chalet in about a week's time.

She said organisers decided not to publicise the birds' presence when they first spotted them last week.

She added: 'It would have been easy for them to be disturbed by people wanting to see the nest and catch a glimpse of the redstarts.

'The show is now closed and we have a secure and private environment for the birds to nest in - or as privately and undisturbed as they can be when the world's largest temporary exhibition is being de-rigged.

'We are usually plane spotters not bird spotters but this week we have taken a keen interest in nature's great flying machines.

'We are all really excited to have the birds with us on site and are keeping them as safe as we possibly can.

'It's fantastic they chose to nest with us.'
