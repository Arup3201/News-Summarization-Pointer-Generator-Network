Peruvian security forces have dynamited 54 airstrips run cocaine smugglers in a futile attempt to stop secret flights in and out of the country.

The runways are hidden across the flood plain of the vast Apurimac and Ene river valley in the South America nation.

While the bombings cut in the profits of the traffickers, they often pay villagers around £60 each to fill the holes so flights are unaffected.

As authorities wound up a 54-airstrip 'cratering' mission, Peru's counter-narcotics police chief General Vicente Romero told reporters that two of the landing strips targeted in the latest operation have each been repaired four times this year.

He also revealed that the 500-meter airstrips are occasionally fixed overnight. 

The area is the world's number one coca-growing valley in the world, with traffickers pocketing thousands of pounds for every Bolivia-bound flight. 

Four or five small planes fly daily into Peru from Bolivia, picking up about 300kg each of coca paste, which is worth about £200million in Bolivia, where it is further refined, authorities say. 

General Romero says pilots earn between £6,000 and £15,000 per flight. 

The border has no radar coverage and the neighbouring nations' air forces are limited so drug flights can only be intercepted on the ground. General Romero said 14 planes have been seized this year.

Peru's anti-drug police, known as Dirandro, says the country produces 450 tons of cocaine a year

Peru surpassed Colombia as the world's top cocaine producer in 2011, with most of the drug ending up in Brazil and Europe

Last week, Peruvian and Bolivian officials agreed to share information in real time on cross-border drug flights so they can try and track down more of the smugglers.

Peru's anti-drug police, known as Dirandro, says the country produces 450 tons of cocaine a year, half of which leaves the country on small Bolivia-bound drugs planes.

Most Peruvian cocaine ends up in Brazil and Europe.

The so-called air bridge between Peru and Bolivia has been especially active since 2011, the year before the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the United Nations said Peru surpassed Colombia as the world's top cocaine producer.

Peru shot down suspected drug flights until 2001, when an air force jet mistakenly fired on a plane carrying U.S. missionaries, killing a woman and her infant daughter.
