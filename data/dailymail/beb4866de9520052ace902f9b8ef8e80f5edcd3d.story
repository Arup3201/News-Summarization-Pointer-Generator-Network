Her coronation on June 2, 1953 was an unprecedented spectacle of pomp and pageantry.

Now, 60 years after the Queen was formally crowned at Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace is to reunite for the first time some of the dresses, uniforms, robes and jewellery worn for the historic event.

Paintings, works of art and unusual objects used for the event will also help to recreate the atmosphere of that extraordinary day, the essence of which has remained unchanged for almost 1,000 years.

60 years on: 60 years after the Queen was crowned at Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace is to display some of the dresses, uniforms, robes and jewellery worn for the historic event

The items will be exhibited in the palace Ballroom this summer, as part of its annual public opening.Staff
today offered an early glimpse of two of its highlights, the outfits 
worn on the day by four-year-old Prince Charles and his sister Princess 
Anne, then aged two.

As
a mother of young children, the Queen was keen that they be involved in
her day and although their clothes may look elaborate, they are 
relatively informal – by royal standards, at least – especially when 
compared to the robes and coronet the Queen wore to her own father’s 
coronation.

They were created by a Miss Hodgson of Sloane Street in London’s Chelsea, then a regular supplier to the Royal Family.

For Charles there was a cream, silk shirt with a lace jabot and trimmed cuffs, and cream woollen trousers.

Curator: Caroline de Guitaut, the exhibition's curator, examines an outfit worn by the two-year-old Princess Anne (L) and the four-year-old Prince Charles on the day of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace

He also wore black patent shoes with buckles and proudly sported his Coronation Medal.

Anne
was deemed too young to attend the ceremony itself but joined in the 
festivities back at the palace afterwards and sported a dress of cream 
silk and lace with a sash and matching ballet pumps.

Home
movie footage to be shown alongside them will capture the Queen waving 
goodbye to her children as she leaves in the Gold State Coach, drawn by 
eight Windsor greys with coachmen in full state livery. Charles later 
left in his own carriage along with his nanny.

A
charming invitation the Queen had drawn up for her eldest son and heir,
which is not thought to have been seen in public before, can also be 
viewed by members of the public.

Then and now: The adorable outfits worn by the two-year-old Princess Anne (L) and the four-year-old Prince Charles on the day of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation will go on display

Whole collection: As well as outfits worn by the Royal family, works of art, paintings and objects used on the day, will also be on display

Created by illustrator Joan Hassall, it is decorated with soldiers, a lion and a unicorn in pencil watercolours and gold paint.

The Queen’s stunning Norman Hartnell-designed white satin Coronation Dress, with its miniscule waist, will also be displayed – although not unveiled until nearer the time – along with her robe and jewels.

The dress incorporated an iconographic
scheme of embroidered national and Commonwealth floral emblems in gold,
silver and pastel-coloured silks, encrusted with pearls, crystals and 
sequins.

Her English purple silk-velvet robe is
more than 21 foot long and equally exquisitely embroidered with wheat 
ears and olive branches, representing peace and prosperity. It took the 
Royal School of needlework more than 3,500 hours to complete.

Also on show will be the iconic 
Diamond Diadem worn by the Queen on her journey to the Abbey, which was 
made for George 1V in 1821, and has since featured on countless postage 
stamps and bank notes, as well as her Coronation necklace and earrings, 
originally designed for Queen Victoria in 1858.

Momentous occasion: The Queen acceded to the throne on 6 February 1952 and was crowned the following year, on 2 June 1953

Exhibition curator Caroline de Guitaut
said: ‘The 60th anniversary of Her Majesty's coronation is an extremely
auspicious anniversary and it seems very fitting that we should mark it
by bringing together this unique display.

‘This will be the first time since 1953 that the outfits of the principal royal party have been displayed together.

‘As Buckingham Palace itself was very 
much a focal point for the celebrations on Coronation Day, it is an 
appropriate setting for visitors to experience something of the 
atmosphere of that historic day.

Crown jewels: Also on show will be the iconic Diamond Diadem worn by the Queen on her journey to the Abbey, which was made for George 1V in 1821

‘The children’s outfits help to remind us of The Queen as Sovereign and, at the same time, as the mother of two young children.’

The Queen’s Coronation 1953 will run at Buckingham Palace as part of the summer opening from July 27 to September 29.
