An adventurous six-year-old boy gave his mother and staff at a Russian airport quite a scare when he climbed onto a baggage carousel and went for a spin.

CCTV footage shows Leon Bogdanov ducking underneath a metal contraption to avoid hitting his head and later attempting to stop himself with his feet as the conveyor belt took him on a behind-the-scenes tour of Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow.

Security guards and other employees scrambled to rescue the child after stunned CCTV operators spotted him riding around inside the airport’s restricted main cargo area.

CCTV operator Sophia Izmailova, 45, said: ‘We saw this lone item coming along the conveyor belt and were immediately suspicious.

‘We were absolutely shocked when we realised that it was a young boy. He was just sitting there as if he was on holiday still. It was a very bizarre sight.’ 

Leon and his 28-year-old mother Elina had just returned from a holiday when he gave her the slip and evaded security to get to the baggage belt taking luggage to and from aircraft.

But staff eventually caught up with him and plucked him off the conveyor belt before he suffered an injury.

Police spokesman Valentine Shchekina said: ‘When officers tried to get hold of him he struggled saying he wanted to finish his ride.’

Security breach: Airport officials say they are investigating the incident

The boy was handed over to his mother who had already reported him missing.

Flabbergasted mum Elina said: ‘He has always been independent and is always looking for adventure.

‘But this is just beyond even his usual antics. I am hoping there was no X-ray machines there - I have asked his doctor to check him over even though the airport staff say he was not at any risk.’

Airport officials say they are investigating how the boy was able to breach security.
