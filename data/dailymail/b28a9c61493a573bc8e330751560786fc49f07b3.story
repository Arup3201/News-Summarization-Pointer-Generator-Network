It was Clarke who read a statement by the devastated family to a packed press conference at the hospital late Thursday, before having to walk away as emotion overcame him.

Dr Brukner then fought back tears as he credited the captain for providing strength and loving support desperately required in a time of need and sadness.

'Phillip has always been a little brother to Michael,' Dr Brukner said.

'Michael's efforts over the last 48 hours to support the family; the family was obviously going through a difficult time but I'm not sure they would have coped without Michael's assistance.

'I was just enormously impressed at the work he did and the genuine care and love he gave to the Hughes family.'
