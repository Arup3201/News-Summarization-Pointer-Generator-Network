When it comes to running for office, it pays to have people remember your name - so long as they can get it right!

Spare a thought for Democratic candidate for Senate in Iowa, Bruce Braley, who thought he'd won the ultimate endorsement by having First Lady Michelle Obama  introduce him at a campaign rally.

But things did not go smoothly and Mrs Obama called him Bruce Bailey instead before going onto tell the crowd that he was a Marine Corps veteran, even though he's not. 

My mate Bruce: First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama and U.S. Senate candidate Bruce Braley wave to the crowd after her speech at the Iowa Votes Rally during which she got his name wrong several times

Bruce whatshisname? First lady Michelle Obama  urged Democrats to send 'Bruce Bailey' to the U.S. Senate in November, repeatedly botching the name of the party's candidate in Iowa before eventually being corrected by the audience

After calling him 'Bruce Bailey' at least five or six times during her remarks at a campaign event, even directing people to 'vote.BruceBailey.com,' an audience member eventually corrected the first lady.

'Braley? What did I say? I'm losing it. I'm getting old. I've been traveling too much,' Mrs Obama said, jokingly and attempting to laughing off the gaffe.

'Vote.BruceBraley.com,' she added. 'I know where I am! I know what I'm doing! That's why we need you young people, you gotta help us out!'

The flub came despite a huge array of signs in the hall where she was speaking, all spelling Braley's name correctly. 

Remember my name! Mr. Braley is locked in a close race with Republican Joni Ernst

The first lady repeated the mistake several times throughout her speech. She also referred to Mr. Braley — who has served in the House since 2007 — as a 'Marine Corps veteran', which he is not! 

On the other gaffe, the First Lady said Braley was a Marine Corps veteran, however it was actually Braley's father who served in the Marines.

Mrs Obama is not the only high profile endorser to make a clip up over the candidates' name. 

Last month, Bill Clinton also called him Bruce Bailey at an event in the state.
