Team news

Leicester 

New signing Andrej Kramaric is still waiting on a work permit a week after signing for Leicester, but is in contention for Saturday's Barclays Premier League visit of Stoke if the red tape is cleared.

Matty James is suspended after his dismissal in last week's 1-0 win over Aston Villa, whilst Kasper Schmeichel, Matt Upson (both foot), Jeff Schlupp (knee) and Riyad Mahrez (African Nations Cup) are also unavailable.

Boss Nigel Pearson also has severe doubts surrounding Dean Hammond (calf) and Esteban Cambiasso (hip), but Danny Drinkwater is poised to return after missing the last two games with a groin problem.

Provisional squad: Hamer, Schwarzer, Moore, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Lawrence, Albrighton, Knockaert, Ulloa, Nugent, Wood, King, Vardy, Drinkwater, Morgan, Taylor-Fletcher, Simpson, Kramaric.

Stoke

Full-back Erik Pieters is a doubt but midfielder Steven Nzonzi should be available for Stoke's Barclays Premier League trip to Leicester.

Both players came off at half-time with groin complaints during last Sunday's 3-0 loss at Arsenal, where Victor Moses returned to the matchday squad as an unused substitute and looks set to make his playing comeback this weekend following a thigh injury.

Forward Mame Biram Diouf remains on African Nations Cup duty with Senegal.

Provisional squad: Begovic, Butland, Shawcross, Wollscheid, Wilson, Huth, Muniesa, Pieters, Bardsley, Cameron, Nzonzi, Adam, Whelan, Ireland, Sidwell, Palacios, Walters, Arnautovic, Crouch, Moses, Bojan.
