Parenting experts have voiced their concern for the six-year-old daughter of Anna Nicole Smith, who has landed her first modelling job as the face of Guess Kids.

Dannielynn Birkhead, who has lived with her father, Larry Birkhead, in Burbank, California, since her mother's tragic death after a drug overdose in 2007, fronts the spring 2013 campaign, and is seen posing on a beach in next season's denims.

But the launch of the campaign has sparked fear for the youngster, with many arguing that she should be sheltered from the spotlight, rather than paraded in front of it.

Like mother, like daughter: Six-year-old Dannielynn Birkhead, the daughter of the late Anna Nicole Smith and Larry Birkhead, has landed her first modelling job as the new face of Guess Kids

A natural: Dannielynn's father reveals she was at ease in front of the lens, and 'needed very little coaching'

Lyss Stern, founder of Divamoms.com, told MailOnline that fame should be something Dannielynn chooses for herself as an adult.

'Why does she have to follow in her mother's footsteps?' she asked. 'Yes, she's a 
beautiful little girl, but it would really be best to keep her out of 
the spotlight until she's an adult.

'She's already been through too much 
for someone her her young, tender age, and has a lifetime of her 
mother's racy history to find for herself on the Internet.

'I think her 
father should be nurturing her and sheltering her from the media, not 
the opposite.

Behind-the-scenes: Dannielynn's father, Larry Birkhead, says he is nothing but proud of his daughter

'If she wants to model when she's adult, then that's her 
decision, but for now, she should be living a life out of the eyes of 
the media.'

In a behind-the-scenes video on Entertainment Tonight, Mr Birkhead is nothing but proud of Dannielynn, who bears a strong resemblance to her late mother.

He reveals she was a natural in front of the camera, and 'needed very little coaching'.

But perhaps it is in her genes: Anna Nicole replaced Claudia Schiffer as the 
face of Guess in 1992, so little Dannielynn is following in her mother's footsteps.

Guess creative director Paul Marciano said in a statement: 'Dannielynn has the same playful spirit that her mother had on a set.'

Model and one-time Playboy cover girl
 Anna Nicole Smith died in February 2007 after a prescription drug 
overdose, just a few months after Dannielynn was born.

Her
 death sparked a fierce paternity battle between several former lovers, 
including Mr Birkhead and Anna Nicole's former lawyer, Howard K Stern 
(who was named on Dannielynn's birth certificate).

A DNA test confirmed that Mr Birkhead was the biological father of Dannielynn in April 2007, and he has since retained custody.

Speaking in the Entertainment Tonight video, Mr Birkhead said he was proud of Dannielynn.

He added: 'I know that Anna's looking at this and seeing how great this will be.'
