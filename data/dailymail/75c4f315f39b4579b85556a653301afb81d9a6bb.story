A 23-year-old Arizona man pleaded guilty Thursday to beating his 19-year-old girlfriend to death last year with a dumbbell.

Luis Soltero, 23, avoided the death penalty for admitting to killing Rebecca 'Becky' Kasper last April, but he will spend at least 25 years in prison with no chance for an early release.

Soltero admitted to the grisly killing this week nearly a year after Kasper's decomposing body was discovered in the bathtub in the apartment she shared with him.

Soltero's plea deal required him to plead guilty to second-degree murder, kidnapping and abuse, according to the Star-Tribune. Prosecutors agreed to drop a first-degree murder charge that would likely have landed the killer on death row.

The Minnesota native had moved to Tempe in 2011 to attend business school at Arizona State University, she met Soltero at a local book store, according to reports.

The pair rapidly grew close, spending holidays with each other's families before Kasper abruptly ended the romance only days before her savage killing at the hands of her jealous ex.

Soltero drove to a local police station with a copy of her Minnesota driver's license and said she was dead, according to the Star Tribune.

He also left a note 
next to the apparent murder weapon allegedly admitting to the brutal 
slaying. 

A statement released at the time by ASU said the school 'extends its sincere condolences to her family and friends at this difficult time.'

'Counseling services for those who knew Kasper are being made available to the university community.'

The 19-year-old's father, Dan Kasper, said in a press conference shortly after her death that his daughter 'loved being a Sun Devil,' referring to ASU's athletic teams, and was on the Dean's List.

Kasper had two sisters and graduated from Northfield (MN) Senior High School in 2011.

'This is like lightning out of the clear blue sky, we had no idea that this was coming,' Dan Kasper, told CBS5 AZ.

Appearing dressed in a black ASU Sun Devils T-shirt, Mr Kasper said his daughter, described as a tough and focused young woman, loved Arizona, where the family had briefly lived when she was a child.

ASU was the only school she had applied to despite him not wanting her to stray far from Minnesota, he added.

She was pursuing a degree in marketing from the W.P. Carey School of Business, and was planning to graduate a year early, but those plans were dashed on a cruel April afternoon by a vengeful Soltero.

No warning signs: Mr Kasper said Soltero seemed laid back and nice after meeting him one Christmas

'She's our daughter, and I just think her story is worth telling,' the emotional Mr Kasper told reporters, adding that Becky was likely going to do something great.

The bereaved father also said that he met Soltero before when Becky brought him home to Minnesota to spend Christmas with her family.

'He was quiet, laid back and easy going, seemed like a good kid,' he said.

According to Becky Kasper's father, she told him that their relationship came to an end a few weeks ago, but that Soltero did not seem upset by it and took the breakup in stride.

Shortly after the slaying, Soltero walked into a Tempe Police Department substation, handed an officer his ID card and Kasper's Minnesota driver's license and said 'My girlfriend is there and she is dead, and I am not going to tell you anything more without an attorney,' according to court papers cited by Phoenix New Times.

Police officers went to Soltero and Kasper's home in Tempe, near the ASU campus, they forced open the door to the unit and found Kasper dead in the bathtub.

Her body was covered with blankets and a yoga mat, with coffee grounds and baking soda sprinkled on top, according to court documents.

The brutally beaten teen's head was covered 
with a plastic bag and her face was described as 'unrecognizable' from substantial blunt-force trauma.

'It's a gruesome scene,' Tempe Police Sgt Mike Pooley told the station KTAR.

Court
 documents indicate that Becky Kasper's wrists were handcuffed and her 
ankles were restrained, and there was blood splatter in the tub, on the 
walls and floor.

The rest of the woman's body was beginning to decay.

A blood-covered dumbbell believed to be the murder weapon was found on the bathroom floor.

Next to the dumbbell, police discovered an unsigned note wedged into the bathroom doors which read in part: 'I did not treat her right. She deserved better but never accepted it. So I had to make the choice for her.'

The author of the rambling missive goes on to say: 'She died on 420 not because of drugs, but because a sociopath talked and treated her nice...I don't know where to go from here. Do I kill again, end it with myself or become invisible?'

Police say the note was penned in handwriting consistent with Soltero's, according to the documents.

Neighbors told police that Soltero and Kasper had a stormy relationship and often could be heard screaming at one another.

The
 leasing office recently had to replace the front door in Soltero's apartment 
after it was damaged during a fight between the couple.  

The 19-year-old victim's employer told 
officials she often came to work with bruises on her arms as if someone 
grabbed her, although she had never reported domestic abuse.

Investigators later learned that Soltero and Kasper had recently split up, but were still spending a lot of time together, documents state.

A search of Soltero's apartment yielded a handwritten list of 'pros and cons' of 'breaking up with Becky.'

Soltero at one point 
asked an officer: 'Do they still have final meals on death row? I was 
wondering if I can order something from Texas,' according to court 
documents.

He was initially charged with first-degree premeditated murder and ordered held on $1million bond.

Photos on Kasper's Facebook page depict the dark-haired, smiling young woman cuddling with her cat, having fun with her girlfriend on prom night and skydiving.

In one of the images posted on her page in December, a grinning, rosy-cheeked Becky Kasper could be seen happily posing with Soltero against the background of a winter wonderland scene.

Her mother wrote in the comments section at the time: 'Now that is a good looking couple!'

A tragically doomed one, as one family has lost its daughter and another family's son might never see the outside of a prison again.
