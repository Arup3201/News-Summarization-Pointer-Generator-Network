George Osborne followed in the footsteps of Tom Cruise today as he mingled with the punters at Glorious Goodwood.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer braved the showers on the fifth day of the festival in West Sussex to watch the racing, surrounded by spectators carrying umbrellas. Pixie Lott was also at the meet, wearing a black hat to keep her hair dry. 

The downpours at the racecourse came as forecasters warned there will be heavy showers overnight, with flash flooding being predicted in some areas.

The mercury
 hit highs of 24C today in East Anglia, while it hovered in the late 
teens in the north, but the sun was interrupted by rain and grey clouds.

The wet weather proved problematic for ground staff at Hampden Park in Glasgow, who spent the afternoon mopping up water from the athletics' track. The site is due to host several finals this evening, including the men's 4x100m relay, in which Usain Bolt will compete for Jamaica.

At the Cambridge Folk Festival, 
dedicated music fans braved the rain as they trudged through fields to 
watch acts including Van Morrison and Sinead O'Connor. 

Revellers at family festival Camp Bestival had more luck with the weather, making the most of blue skies in sunny Dorset. The festival, which was held at Lulworth Castle, saw adults and children - many dressed in bright costumes - treated to Medeival-themed attractions including jousting and tightrope walking.

More
 wet weather is predicted in Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern 
England and north Wales, but the west is expected to bear the brunt of 
the heavy showers. 

On
 Monday, rain is expected in north-west Scotland, but will clear to 
leave sunny spells across the UK. However a few downpours are likely for
 England and Wales.  The rain will die away at the beginning of next 
week but looks set to return on Wednesday. 

Forecasters have already predicted that August will be blighted by showers following one of the hottest Julys on record.

Billy
 Payne, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said yesterday: 'It is very 
unsettled across the country. We have got showers and longer spells of 
rain.

'There is going to be a lot of rain and thunderstorms. It will feel very different from the fine weather we have had recently.'

Britons have enjoyed glorious sunshine and sizzling temperatures for the past few weeks, but things will turn far cooler over the next few days. 

Mr Payne added: 'Through the rest of the week there is going to be some rain and showers moving in from the west. And you will certainly notice the breeze pick up everywhere, we will experience gusts.

Best of the weather: Dressed in circus-themed costumed, festival-goers make the most of the sunny south west as they attend Camp Bestival

'There is a danger of flash flooding, 
there is certainly some surface water flooding possible as a result of 
the rain. there will be unseasonable summer storms.'

Tom Cruise was among the VIPs stepping out for Ladies' Day at Glorious Goodwood on Thursday.

And showing he still has the ability to make women swoon, the star was seen enjoying an animated conversation with royal Zara Phillips.

The star, who is currently in London for his latest film, was even seen taking a picture with the Queen's grandchild, much to Natalie Pinkham's delight.
