Roma missed the chance to move to the top of Serie A as they were held to a 0-0 draw at third-placed Sampdoria, who successfully extended their unbeaten start to the season.

Sergio Romero was Sampdoria's hero with an outstanding save late on to prevent the Giallorossi snatching all three points in Genoa. 

Roma failed to score for the first time this season but will have been happy just to have kept a clean sheet against unbeaten Sampdoria following Tuesday's 7-1 Champions League mauling at the hands of Bayern Munich.

The visitors had the better of the match as Gervinho struck the post in the first half before Alessandro Florenzi's header was brilliantly saved by Romero in the second.

Stefano Okako missed Sampdoria's best opening when he fired over from two metres as a free kick landed at his feet. 

'It was a good game between two teams which play a lovely style of football,' Sampdoria coach Sinisa Mihajlovic said. 'My lads were very good, today we took step up in quality, showing that we can take on anyone, especially at home.'

Sampdoria did have the ball in the back of the net but Manolo Gabbiadini's strike was ruled out for offside. Roma youth product Stefano Okaka also missed a good opportunity for Samp as he blasted over from about three yards out. 

The draw took Roma level on points with leaders Juventus, who hold top spot on goal difference and host Palermo on Sunday, while Sampdoria have now won four and drawn four of their eight games this term. 

Antonio Cassano (R) scored for Parma but couldn't prevent them from losing 3-1 to local rivals Sassuolo

Meanwhile, Parma's season went from bad to worse as they were beaten 3-1 at home by local rivals Sassuolo, who celebrated their first victory of the campaign.

Parma continue to prop up the rest of the division after suffering a seventh defeat in eight Serie A games this season, leaving them stuck on three points.

Sergio Floccari, Francesco Acerbi and Saphir Taider did the damage at the Stadio Tardini as Sassuolo took maximum points for the first time this term to move out of the bottom three.

Antonio Cassano pulled a goal back late on for Parma, but it was nothing more than a consolation on another forgettable evening for Roberto Donadoni's side.

In Saturday's other game, Cagliari leapfrogged Empoli in the standings thanks to an emphatic 4-0 win in Tuscany.

Four goals in 15 minutes leading up to half-time did the damage for the visitors, with the hosts doing their best to recover in the second period but unable to prevent a third loss of the season.

Marco Sau put Zdenek Zeman's men in front before two goals from Danilo Avelar, the second from the penalty spot, and an Albin Ekdal strike sealed the points for the Sardinians.
