Wheel Of Fortune whiz Emil De Leon, a pediatric nursing student, revealed today that he had 'baby on the brain' when he correctly solved a 12-letter, three-word puzzle with only two letters on the board.

He confessed he had been studying the medical care of babies shortly before appearing on the game show which probably influenced his amazing guess.Â 

The 25-year-old game show contestant shocked longtime Wheel Of Fortune host Pat Sajak when he came up with the correct answer 'new baby buggy' on his first attempt and won the $45,000 bonus puzzle.

Emil De Leon said today that he had been watching Wheel Of Fortune his whole life so had become quick at solving puzzles on very few letters

Mr De Leon said on Friday: 'I was very scatterbrained at that time.'

The show was filmed back in January and the contestant had to keep his amazing win a secret until the episode aired this week. He said: 'It was very hard, the longest two months of my life.'

Mr De Leon has honed his talents for guessing word puzzles after watching Wheel Of Fortune from the age of three or four.

In answer to those who criticized whether his win was real, he told Today: 'The people who know me, know my skills as a puzzle solver. My skills prove that it was me.'

Mr De Leon plans to use the money to pay off his school loans from nursing college.

'Tonight's ''Wheel of Fortune'' features most amazing solve in my 30+ years on the show. No kidding,' Pat tweeted on Wednesday when the show was broadcast.

Only two letters were on the board when Emil De Leon was left to figure it out...

The Daly City, California resident 
said he usually can figure out the word puzzles after five seconds and 
is right about '99 percent' of the time.

Mr De Leon only had an 'n' and 'e' at the beginning of the first three-letter word
 to go with and no letters for the four-letter second word and 
five-letter third word.

He figured the first word was 'new' and said 'baby' just felt right.

Emil then blurted out 'new baby buggy' and it took several seconds for the puzzle letters to turn and reveal he was correct.

Wheel
 Of Fortune has been a staple of American television since 1975, with 
the current nationally syndicated version running since 1983.
