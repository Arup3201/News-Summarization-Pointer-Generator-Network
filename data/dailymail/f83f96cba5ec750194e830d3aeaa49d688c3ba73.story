A tiny island located off the coast of Russia can now be visited by the public after decades of use as a secret military base.

These pictures of Askold give a rare insight in to Russia's military past as the island is one of the few places located in the country's fortified Fokino territory which can be visited by tourists.

Fokino - which is located in Russia's Primorye or maritime province at the lowest tip of the country - is closed off because the Russian Pacific Fleet is situated there.

Shrouded in mystery: The Island of Askold can be visited by the public after decades as of use as a secret military base

Prime position: Askold comes under Russia's Fokino territory - located at the lowest tip of the country - which is closed of to foreigners because its Pacific Fleet is situated there

The tip of the iceberg: The Island of Askold gives visitors a unique insight into Russia's military past

All foreigners need a special permit to be able to visit Fokino.

But the small abandoned fort on the island of Askold, located in the Sea of Japan, is the one exception in the area and is now open to curious tourists wanting a glimpse of Russia's military past.

Across Askold, signs of its previous use are visible, with abandoned tanks and command posts strewn across the island.

At one time, the island was the centre point of a conflict between Japan and Russia over lucrative goldfields situated there.

Tropical idyll: The island is located in the Sea of Japan and offers a warm climate during the summer months but turns freezing cold in winter

Askold was the centre of a dispute between Russia and Japan over the lucrative gold deposits on the island

The main task of soldiers situated 
there was to observe the Japanese attempt to construct mine fields to 
block Russian maritime routes.

It was also used to keep the largest gulf in the Sea of Japan - known as Peter the Great Gulf - safe from interference from other nations.

A permanent observation post was constructed on the island in 1892.

It formed part of Russia's Vladivostok Fortress - a complex system of unique fortifications built across coast of the country in the late 19th and early 20th Century.

Askold island was connected with the main land headquarters through a telegraph line.

Isolated retreat: There are no inhabitants on the island and hardly any visitors because transport from the mainland is irregular

Abandoned: The island linked up with the Russian mainland through a telegraph line

Today, the island is no longer used for the military, but acts as a unique museum to its naval history.

There is still no permanent population on Askold and the island has few visitors because of the absence of regular transport connections with the mainland.

The weather is unpredictable, often humid during the summer and freezing cold during the winter.

It is believed there are still dozens of tonnes of gold deposits still hidden on the island.
