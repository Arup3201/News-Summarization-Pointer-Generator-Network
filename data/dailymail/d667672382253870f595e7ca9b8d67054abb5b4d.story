A boy has survived falling 45ft from a chairlift on a ski slope in New Mexico. 

Footage of the fall was posted on YouTube by the snowboarder's friend who can be heard screaming 'dude!' as the boy clings on for dear life. 

According to the clip, the boy had to be helicoptered to a nearby hospital suffering from a fractured skull, collapsed lung and a torn liver.

Holding on: The boy dangles in the air as the ski lift climbs higher and higher

Going, going, gone: The boy can't hold on any longer and lets go dropping 45ft

Badly injured: Video footage captured the snowboarder hitting the snow after falling 45ft which resulted in him suffering a fractured skull and collapsed lung

His friend wrote: 'I was skiing when my friend gets off balance and ends up hanging from the chair.

'He did not have the security bar down. He hung from about pole eight to 21 and at 21 he fell.

'Pole 21 was the third highest stretch at about 45ft high.' 

The clip has gone viral and has been viewed more than 260,000 times. 

His friend added: 'There have been quite a few questions about where his board went, he unhooked it (I have no idea how snowboards work I ski) he hung with hand to do this. 

'He did this to gain some sort of grip or something. Obviously that didn’t work.'

Terrifying: The snowboarder's friend looked on helplessly as the boy clung on for dear life

A 19-year-old college student died last year after falling off a chairlift while skiing in Park City, Utah.

A boy also had to be rescued by strangers after he slid out of the chair and dangled 25ft in the air at the Hidden Valley Ski and Snowboard Area in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin in 2012.
