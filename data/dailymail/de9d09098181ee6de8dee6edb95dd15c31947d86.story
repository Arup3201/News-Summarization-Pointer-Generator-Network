A blundering burglar tried to rob a Los Angeles home and left empty handed with a trail of evidence behind him, including his car, fingerprints and photos of himself.

Miguel Luna, 25, of Pacoima, California, parked his Honda in the driveway of the house last Tuesday and kicked in the front door before ransacking a bedroom, police said.

Luna apparently missed the various signs outside warning the home is under surveillance.

During his robbery attempt, he made enough noise to wake the owner of the house, who had been sleeping in another room, NBC reported.

The homeowner confronted Luna, who pleaded with him not to call the cops and then walked outside to his car.

The car wouldn't start.

Luna then re-entered the house and again begged the homeowner not to turn him in, saying he was a friend of the man's daughter.

The homeowner chased Luna out, picked up a garden hoe and hit him in the head with it.

As Luna lay on the ground, the homeowner's wife called the police.

He soon got up and ran away, leaving a car full of evidence behind, including several iPads, which police suspect were stolen. One of the iPads had Luna’s pictures on it.

‘This crime scene was really a study in how to get caught,’ Los Angeles police lieutenant, Paul Vernon, said in a statement.

Luna has been arrested three times this year on charges of possession of methamphetamine, receipt of stolen property and possession of burglary tools, police records show.

He also was arrested in a 2010 burglary.
