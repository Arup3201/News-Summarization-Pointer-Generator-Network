Helen Fielding says the death of her father made her realise that life has many 'twists and turns'

Author Helen Fielding said her latest Bridget Jones Diary reflects how real life does not always have happy endings.

Millions of Bridget Jones fans were shocked this week when it was revealed that Mark Darcy has been killed off in the book, Mad About The Boy.

But Fielding says the death of her father in a car crash made her realise that life has many 'twists and turns'.

She said: 'It's like the keys of a piano isn't it? There are white notes and black notes.

'And there's a tragicomic element in my writing; the happy ending is just where you choose to end a book.

'Life, with all its twists and turns, carries on beyond it.'

Fifteen years after the last instalment, the unlucky-in-love protagonist is now 51, and a single parent bringing up two children after barrister Darcy died.

Fielding told British Vogue that her outlook on life changed after the death of her father when she was 24.

She said: 'It was horrible and shocking and made me very aware that life is complicated and precarious.'

Despite Bridget's tragedy, the author says the character's new life shows how women in their 50s are full of vitality and still want to look good and go out on dates.

Bridget is dating a 29-year-old called Roxter and is still worrying about her weight and how much she drinks.

Helen Fielding said the new Bridget Jones's Diary reflects that life does not always have happy endings. Bridget (played by Renee Zellweger in the film adaptations) is a single mother after Mark Darcy (played by Colin Firth) dies

She said: 'Women of my age are still dating, having sex and looking great.

'A woman's sell-by date is getting later and later, and quite right, too.'

Fielding, who has always denied that the 
books are autobiographical, is herself a 55-year-old single 
mother-of-two who ended her relationship with television executive Kevin
 Curran in 2009.

She said the book reflects how 'hard motherhood can feel sometimes.'

She added: 'Nobody's life is perfect and today, more than ever, I think women are under a huge pressure to be something, achieve something, look like something.

'We are all constantly constructing a facade.'

Heralding the arrival of 'chick lit', Bridget Jones's Diary started life as a newspaper column in 1995.

Two
 best-selling novels, with their corresponding Hollywood blockbuster 
film adaptations featuring Renee Zellweger as Bridget and Colin Firth as
 Darcy, followed.

Mad About The Boy is published on October 10,
