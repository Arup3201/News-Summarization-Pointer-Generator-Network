A canine fashion designer has come up with a way for Taiwanese dog owners to keep their beloved pet’s reputation intact.

Inventor Zhang Daxing has designed a pair of ‘chastity pants’ for female dogs to wear when their owners take them out for a stroll.

The idea of the innocent ‘doggiepants’ is to make sure they stay that way – by allowing the dogs to carry out their needs, yet prohibiting unwanted attention from male admirers.

Protected pooch: The 'doggiepants' have been especially designed for female dogs to prevent stray males from doing what comes natural

The inventor explained: ‘It is very upsetting for owners to find their dogs being attacked in the streets.

‘These pants now make it impossible for them to be assaulted.’

For £25 Taiwanese dog owners can keep 
their precious pedigree free from any involvement with strays and the 'doggiepants' 
are getting rave reviews.

Dog lover Chi Sun said: ‘It's a 
brilliant idea. My girl is very sensitive and I find it very offensive 
when these rough strays start sniffing around her.’

Chaste Chi-Chi: The pants sell for £25 on the streets of Taiwan and have had a positive reception from owners who want to keep strays away from their lady dogs

Dog style: The 'doggiepants' can be combined with other dog clothes to make a full outfit and keep the pet snug, warm and chaste
