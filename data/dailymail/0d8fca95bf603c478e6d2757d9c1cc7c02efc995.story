One of the country’s most prestigious private schools ran out of emergency contraceptive pills after requests from pupils who had sex in their boarding houses.

The revelation was made in an email in which senior staff at the £33,000-a-year co-educational Stowe School voiced ‘great concerns’ when supplies of the ‘morning-after’ pill were exhausted after one weekend earlier this year.

Assistant Head Peter Last wrote in the email, leaked to The Mail on Sunday, that the fact pupils were ‘relaxed enough’ to have sex in a boarding house and ‘openly’ tell school nurses suggested staff needed to increase vigilance and warn pupils about their behaviour.

Stowe School in Buckinghamshire ran out of emergency contraceptive pills after requests from pupils who had sex in their boarding houses, an email revealed

A former member of staff at the Buckinghamshire school, whose alumni include Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriends Chelsy Davy and Cressida Bonas, said the email ‘shocked’ staff because it showed sexual activity among pupils was much more prevalent than suspected. 

Family values campaigners criticised the school, with former GP Trevor Stammers, a spokesman for the Family Education Trust, saying he was ‘extremely concerned and disappointed’ that the school gave mixed messages by banning sex but providing the ‘morning-after’ pill.

The email was sent on February 4 to matrons and heads of the school’s 12 houses.

Mr Last, who is also a housemaster, wrote: ‘After this last weekend... the Medical Centre ran out of supplies of emergency contraception early this week.

‘Not only is this worrying enough in itself, but it is also of great concern that some of the pupils who have been asking for emergency contraception have told the nurses that they were having sex in boarding houses over the weekend...’

Mr Last’s email continued: ‘Sexual activity is a very serious pastoral concern for us as a school, and something we need to be constantly vigilant for.

‘The school rules do, of course, state that “no study, bedroom or dormitory may be entered by a student of the opposite sex” and it also very clear that students having sex in school time (either on site or off) are “liable to expulsion”.

‘This is clearly a difficult area to police, but the fact that students are openly saying that they have been having sex in their houses at weekends suggests that our level of supervision of them at weekends needs to be stepped up...’

The school, which opened in 1923 with 99 pupils and whose other alumni include businessman Sir Richard Branson and the late actor David Niven, is housed in one of the country’s most imposing  neo-classical buildings, Stowe House, set in 750 acres of landscaped gardens and parkland outside Buckingham.

The ex-staff member said: ‘We were aware that there was some sexual activity... but the email was a shock because we were being told that sex was taking place more frequently than we had first thought.

‘Crucially, sex was taking place in houses. Sex in houses was a big no-no. Even boys going into girls’ dorms or bedrooms was a big no-no.’

The ex-staff member said that Stowe School did not provide condoms to its 770 pupils, who include about 220 girls, because of fears it might encourage sexual activity and because of its Christian ethics.

There is no suggestion that any of the sex taking place was under-age.

Law firm Schillings last night said on behalf of the school that Stowe’s  medical centre held only two morning-after pills at the time.

The school stated: ‘Stowe places the utmost importance in providing the highest level of pastoral care for all of its pupils.

‘The school has clear policies, rules and procedures in place covering all pastoral issues, including those that concern sexual behaviour. Transgressors of the school rules risk expulsion. The school continually reviews procedures to ensure the maintenance of high standards of pastoral care.’

Stowe School, where 90 per cent of pupils are boarders, has been embroiled in controversies before.

In 2003, a former pupil was arrested for alleged sex abuse of a 14-year-old still at Stowe. A year earlier there was a drugs probe when the rave drug ketamine was found in a student’s room.
