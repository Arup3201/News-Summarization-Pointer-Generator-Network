Red-faced police scored an own goal when they evacuated hundreds of fans from a football stadium - after officers accidentally left a fake bomb in an executive box.

Around 30,000 fans were getting ready to celebrate Wolverhampton Wanderers' League One title at Molineux on the last day of the season when the drama unfolded.

Terrified supporters discovered the suspicious package in an executive box and raised the alarm, resulting in several hundred fans being evacuated from one stand.

Concerned staff even considered calling off the game – just minutes before kick-off on Saturday, May 3.

But it was revealed soon afterwards that the bomb was an imitation explosive device left behind by careless police after a training exercise.

An investigation has now been launched by West Midlands Police into how the fake bomb could have been left inside the stadium after it received an official complaint.

Despite the police erroneously evacuating one stand at Molineux before the match, Wolves won the match 3-0 and the League One title and celebrate in style

Wolves Chief Executive Jez Moxey said that he had expressed his concern to the force ‘in the strongest possible manner’ after the game - effectively a promotion party for the fans - was almost scrapped.

He added: ‘Understandably, this incident caused significant distress to the individual supporters concerned and we have, of course, been in close dialogue with the specific box holder.

‘However, although only a small number of our fans were affected, it could easily have resulted in a wide scale evacuation of the stadium which, under the circumstances, would have had more serious implications.

‘We have been in contact with West Midlands Police and explained our concerns in the strongest possible manner.’

Mr Moxey said he was satisfied that police had acted quickly and responsibly by issuing a full apology and launching an investigation, and reassured supporters Molineux was a safe venue to visit.

With league rules stating that all final day games must kick off at the same time any delay for the match with relegation threatened Carlisle United would have had serious repercussions.

Goals from Sam Ricketts, Michael Jacobs and Nouha Dicko won the game 3-0 for Wolves, who lifted the League One trophy after the match.

Fans expressed their disgust at being ordered to leave the ground before kick-off with some admitting they missed out on joining in their team's celebrations.

Season-ticket holder David Billinghurst, 45, from Wolverhampton, said: ‘It was a farce. I've been to every home game this season and was really looking forward to seeing them lift the trophy but I was ordered out the ground.

‘Officers suddenly started telling fans to leave the stadium as a precaution and I obeyed. I left the ground and only realised it was a mistake when I got home.

‘I'm gutted I missed out on watching the team on their most memorable day of the season. I'm the laughing stock with my mates now because I just went home.’

Chief Inspector Ian Marsh, the Silver Commander in charge of policing for the match, said: ‘An imitation explosive device was found in an executive box at Molineux Stadium on Saturday against Carlisle United. It had been placed there during a training exercise.

‘Whilst the device posed no danger to anyone we appreciate it may have caused concern for the supporters who found it and we apologise for any distress it caused.

‘We've received a complaint and will respond to this in due course.

‘The matter has been referred to West Midlands Police Professional Standards Department who will look into the incident and advise on any learning that may arise.’
