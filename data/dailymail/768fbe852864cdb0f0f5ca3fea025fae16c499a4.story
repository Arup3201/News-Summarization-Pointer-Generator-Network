Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne looked down in the dumps as he put his bins out in what is his first public appearance since he was sectioned following an alcohol meltdown.

The 47-year-old looked downcast when he was spotted wearing a blue dressing gown, tartan pyjama bottoms and slip-on shoes outside his property in Poole, Dorset.

The former midfielder, who was sectioned for his own safety last month, was also sporting scars to his face following a recent fall while he carried out the chore at 1pm on Thursday.

It is the first time Gascoigne, who retired from football in 2004, has been pictured in public since being sectioned under the Mental Health Act on October 24.

The star was placed on a three-day emergency detox after being rushed to hospital in the early hours following an apparent alcohol binge.

He is now said to be recovering at home with his new 44-year-old girlfriend Mandy Thomas, who he only recently started seeing.

She is said to have vowed to stand by him and is helping him with his recovery.

Less than 48 hours prior to his hospitalisation last month, the pair were pictured out and about and onlookers said they had been discussing their plans for the future.

They are said to have met after the former Newcastle, Tottenham and Rangers star visited the post office she runs in Bournemouth, Dorset.

Ms Thomas, who is separated from her husband and has two children, is said to be 'besotted' with the star with whom she has become 'inseparable'.

She reportedly helped him move into his new apartment in the expensive area of Sandbanks in Poole in August.

It was shortly after he was released from Poole Hospital after another alcoholic breakdown that he was found slumped outside his flat clutching a bottle of gin.

Friends said the new couple viewed the move as a fresh start and said that Ms Thomas hopes to help him through the most recent 'setback'.

The football ace has suffered a long battle with alcoholism and was previously sectioned six years ago.

The star, who made 57 appearances for his country, has been in rehab seven times and was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008, following an incident at a Newcastle hotel.

His seventh stint in rehab was in January this year when he checked into a £6,000-a-month treatment clinic in Southampton.

Last month, the star was pictured cradling a chicken while enjoying a pint and speaking to locals in a pub beer garden. 

At the time of his hospitalisation, Gascoigne's agent Terry Baker told MailOnline that the star 'is not very well' but refused to comment on his condition any further.
