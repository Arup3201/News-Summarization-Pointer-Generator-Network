First The Great British Bake Off spawned a cult ‘bingo’ game for soggy bottom lovers.

Now the BBC is hoping to replicate the show’s success with a version for amateur gardeners - and has filled it with even more naughty innuendo than its predecessor.

Starting next week, The Big Allotment Challenge will see nine pairs of green fingered contestants compete for the title of best grower by producing vegetables, fruits and flowers for a panel of experts.

The BBC show will be hosted by Fern Britton, left, and judged Jim Buttress, Thane Prince and Jonathan Moseley

In the place of Bake Off’s Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, the new show will be judged by the Queen’s former gardener Jim Buttress, jam expert Thane Prince and floral designer Jonathan Moseley.

Hosted by Fern Britton, it was filmed over six months last year and will follow the same format as the hit cookery show, where contestants are set a different challenge each week and attempt to avoid elimination.

Mr Buttress supposedly provides much of the show's risque humour

But producers are hoping viewers will also appreciate its irreverent puns, following Bake Off’s lead.

Bake Off spawned an internet craze in which viewers flocked to social networking sites to share the best catchphrases, including ‘soggy bottom’, ‘raise your game’ and ‘it’s got a good wobble.’

Many of the vegetable double entendres in the Allotment Challenge are even more risqué.

In the first episode, viewers will hear Mr Buttress, 69, discuss the merits of some ‘good, erect stems’, a comment that produces muffled laughter from his fellow judges.

Later in the show, Miss Prince advises a contestant on the correct pan to use for jam making, saying with a knowing look that it depends on ‘the thickness of your bottom’.

Speaking before the show’s launch, Mr Buttress - who was superintendent of the Royal Parks for 25 years - admitted he deliberately inserted naughty puns into the show to liven it up.

He said: ‘At the end of the day you’ve got to enjoy it. It’s got to be fun. That’s my motto in life.

‘And I’ve always been a great believer in just twisting it a little bit, because nobody gets hurt. It takes it away from being boring.’

The show’s executive producer Daisy Goodwin promised it will get even ruder as the series progresses. She said ‘You’ll enjoy episode six. Thane does utter the words “I’ve got wood in my mouth”’.

She added: ‘Melons week was excellent. People got the giggles.’

Former This Morning presenter Miss Britton, 56, said it was a ‘tradition’ to slip rude jokes into otherwise innocent TV shows.

The new show hopes to ride the same wave of enthusiasm that has made the Great British Bake Off, judged by Paul Hollywood, left, and Mary Berry, right, such a success

She added: ‘Jonathan (Moseley) was very naughty. His eyebrows were shooting up at some stages.’

It is Mr Buttress who is set to carve a role for himself as the gardening equivalent of Mary Berry on the show.

He has been tending to flowers and plants since he was a ‘nipper’ and in a separate interview with the Radio Times, he opened up about his time as the Royal gardener.

He said: ‘I was in charge of Hyde Park, St James’ Park, Kensington Gardens, Buckingham Palace and Clarence House. All the Queen Mum wanted was flowers, flowers, flowers. But when Charlie took over at Clarence, large areas were turned into an allotment because he’s a vegetable nut. He used to come and ask advice. Her Majesty took after her mother: more colour than veg.’

Asked if he was a prickly judge, he replied: ‘Someone said I was a cross between Ray Winstone and Paul Hollywood! I am just myself and I try to give lots of advice. I hope this is going to inspire people. No disrespect to makeover programmes but one minute it looks like a jungle and the next you could be at Chelsea Flower Show. That’s not gardening. Gardening is all: “Oh no, the greenfly’s got the roses,” or “Jack Frost’s destroyed the beans”. A lot of that happened and there were tears.’

The Big Allotment Challenge was filmed in a walled garden within the grounds of Mapledurham House in Oxfordshire last year.

It will screen on Tuesday, April 15, on BBC2 at 8pm.
