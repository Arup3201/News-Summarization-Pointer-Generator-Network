Victoria Oddy has been jailed for three years and 11 months following a series of knife-point robberies on women to fund her £100,000-a-year drug habit

A mother threatened a student with a ten-inch blade and dug her nails into another woman's hand in a series of robberies to fund her £300-a-day heroin habit, a court has heard.

Victoria Oddy, 27, was caught by residents who overpowered her after she was seen threatening the student who was walking home from the gym.

Oddy, from Horsforth, Leeds, was jailed for three years and 11 months yesterday at Leeds Crown Court after pleading guilty to two offences of robbery, attempted robbery and the possession of an offensive weapon.

The court heard Oddy’s victims were left badly traumatised by the attacks and one still suffers from anxiety and struggles to sleep.

Prosecutor Duncan Ritchie told the court the first attack took place on June 17 as the victim walked along a path at about 7.45pm.

Oddy ran up behind the victim and grabbed her before demanding her mobile phone.

She told the woman: 'I have got a knife, I’m going to stab you.'

She punched the woman in the face but the victim managed to run off and raise the alarm.

Oddy then attacked a 25-year-old woman on the evening of July 3, lunging at the woman as she was on her phone.

She dug her nails into the woman’s hand during the attack before making off with with the phone.

The court also heard someone managed to access the victim’s Facebook account shortly after the incident and she had a threatening message e-mailed to her which stated: 'We know where you live.'

Oddy was caught on July 18 after she attacked a student who was walking home from the gym.

Oddy held a knife to the woman’s throat and the blade snapped off as the victim tried to defend herself - but residents in a nearby house saw the attack and helped detain Oddy.

Oddy refused to comment when interviewed about the offences. She was later picked out at an identity procedure.

Narinder Rathour, mitigating, said the offences were committed at a time when Oddy had a £300-a-day drug addiction and was in fear of dealers.

He said Oddy accepted full responsibility for her offending and was full of shame at what she had done.

'This was a disgraceful and very frightening set of offences, fuelled no doubt by the serious addiction you had at the time'

He said her father died of cancer in 2011 and two days later she discovered she was pregnant to a partner who subsequently abducted her and held her prisoner.

The lawyer said Oddy was responding well to treatment in prison, had developed an interest in fitness and gym sport and had no intention of returning to abusing drugs.

Jailing Oddy, Recorder David Osborne said: 'This was a disgraceful and very frightening set of offences, fuelled no doubt by the serious addiction you had at the time. You have caused lasting harm to the people you robbed.'

Referring to the extent of her drug addiction, he said: 'She had a £300 a day habit.

'That is £110,000 per year. It is a huge amount of money that needs to be acquired to feed that addiction.'
