A lawyer for the wife of a Georgia man arrested in the death of their toddler who was left in a overheated SUV said Tuesday the mother is devastated by her loss.

Criminal defense attorney Lawrence Zimmerman said Leanna Harris is ‘living every parent's nightmare’ after the death of her 22-month-old son, Cooper.

The woman's husband, Justin Ross Harris, 33, was arrested on charges of murder and child cruelty after the boy's death June 18.

Mom: Police have not named Leanna Harris as a suspect and she has not been charged with any crime

The father told police he left his son in the backseat of his SUV for about seven hours after forgetting to drop him off at day care and going to work, investigators in the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County have said.

Leanna Harris has not been charged in the case.

Zimmerman criticized media coverage of her reaction to her son's death, saying speculation over a perceived lack of emotion in the case thus far is similar to what 1996 Olympic bombing hero Richard Jewell faced after an attack that year on the summer games in Atlanta.

Jewell led people away from a suspicious backpack before a blast killed one and left more than 100 people injured.

He became the target of intense scrutiny after an unattributed news report said he was the focus of the investigation into the attack.

Jewell's name was cleared in 2006 and he died the following year at age 44.

‘Newspapers, television and online media have fostered a poisonous atmosphere in which Leanna's every word, action and emotion — or failure to cry in front of a crowd — is scrutinized for some supposed hidden meaning,’ Zimmerman said.

He added that the media has dug into his client's upbringing, marriage and sex life. Zimmerman also said Leanna Harris has been unable to return to work and she's asking to be allowed to mourn her son out of the public eye.

'She will never be able to tuck him into bed at night and return later to check on him.

'She
 mourns Cooper's death deeply, in her own private way,' the lawyer 
stated. 'She takes comfort from a strong faith in God, but the loss is 
still overwhelming. Getting through each day seems almost impossible.'

During
 an hourslong probable cause hearing on July 3, prosecutors said 
evidence shows Justin Ross Harris had been leading a double life and was
 sending nude photos with several women — including at least one 
teenager — even on the day his son died.

The
 couple had two life insurance policies for the toddler, one for $2,000 
and one for $25,000. After his son's death, Harris talked with relatives
 about what they needed to do to file claims, investigators have said.

Harris'
 defense attorney Maddox Kilgore has argued that evidence in the case is
 insufficient and the boy's death was a tragic accident. Justin Ross Harris remains jailed without bond.

Investigation: Cobb County police investigate the SUV where toddler Cooper Harris died near Marietta, Ga., when his father Ross forgot to drop his child off at day care and went to work

Last Thursday, police said a 
toxicology tests on the body of 22-month-old Cooper had negative 
results, but they didn't say what substances they tested for.

Toxicology tests typically are used to detect foreign substances such as drugs in a person's system.

A
 growing number of questions are being asked about Leanna Harris' 
unusual behavior in the wake of young Cooper’s horrific death inside a 
sweltering SUV last month.

Harris,
 a 30-year-old dietitian, expressed little emotion throughout her 
husband's preliminary hearing last week, despite a number of shocking 
allegations including that her husband had been sexting with six 
different women, some teenagers, on the day their young son had passed 
away.

As
 prosecutors said her husband was practically leading a double life and 
should not be granted bond, Leanna Harris chewed gum and stared blankly 
ahead.

During last Thursday’s proceedings, investigators described her own behavior on the day her son died as odd, if not suspicious.

No bond: Justin Ross Harris, the Georgia man charged with murder after his toddler son died inside of a hot SUV, was refused bond on July 3 and will now remain in jail until he is tried

When informed by workers at her son’s 
day care facility that Cooper had never been dropped off, she calmly 
responded, ‘Ross must have left him in the car. There’s no other 
explanation,’ according to Cobb County Police Det. Phil Stoddard’s 
testimony.

Then, when 
reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been 
charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him, ‘Did you say too much?’ 
according to Stoddard.

When she called home June 18 with the 
grim news of Cooper’s death, her mother could be overheard on the phone 
saying: ‘Why aren’t you crying? Why aren’t you reacting?’

Her response, according to Stoddard: ‘I must be in shock.’

Police
 had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched 
children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper’s death, telling 
officers it was her ‘worst fear.’

At Cooper’s funeral - and with her husband listening from jail on speaker phone - she said she held no anger toward him.

‘Ross
 is and was a wonderful father,’ she told mourners, before telling her 
husband of seven years: ‘I love you and I’m doing this for you.’

Some of Leanna Harris’ comments during her eulogy at Cooper’s funeral have also raised suspicions.

‘Some of you might wonder how I’m standing here today and I ask myself the same question,’ the deeply religious mother said.

‘I should be crumpled into a pile of tears and snot on the ground. (The Lord) is standing behind me, holding me up.'

Leanna Harris listened intently to the evidence against her husband being presented by the prosecution and was later escorted to a waiting car after Justin Harris was denied bond

The
 250 or so mourners who gathered at University Church of Christ gave her
 two rounds of applause as she said she wouldn’t bring her son back, 
even if she could.

‘He’s in the most peaceful, wonderful place there is.’

Justin Ross Harris was denied bond last Thursday by a judge who called it a 'possible death penalty case.'

He remains in jail on murder and child cruelty charges and prosecutors may seek to use Leanna Harris as a witness.

In
 Georgia, the spousal privilege shielding a wife from testifying against
 her husband, doesn’t apply in cases of the death of a child.

Harris described Cooper as peaceful with his eyes closed, when this wasn't the case, according to Stoddard. He allegedly also told his wife: 'I dreaded how he would look'
