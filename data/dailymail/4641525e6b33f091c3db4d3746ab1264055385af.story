Prime Minister Tony Abbott has admitted that Australia's security system failed to put Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis under surveillance before he killed two people.  

'The system did not adequately deal with this individual,' he conceded on Wednesday morning.

'Two very decent people are dead, others are injured, others are traumatised because of a madman who was roaming our streets.'

Monis and two of his hostages - Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson - died at the end of a 16-hour siege in Sydney's centre, in the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, before dawn on Tuesday.

Mr Abbott has promised to be upfront with Australians in a public report about how the security system neglected to put the self-styled Sheik on a watchlist but federal police and spies are unlikely to shed much light when questioned.

The investigation will also look at how and where Monis got a gun and how he was left unwatched

Court documents show that the dead gunman was facing up to 50 sexual offence charges, including aggravated sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault and inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act.

Monis painted the breasts and bodies of women with water, massaged their breasts and rubbed his genitals against them and raped them in 'spiritual healing' sessions all over Sydney going back 13 years, the documents allege.

The 50-year-old committed the sexual offences against women at his Spiritual Consultation business in the Sydney suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between September 2001 and September this year, according to the documents. 

Mr Abbott said he intended to publish a report into what happened in the lead-up to Monday's siege and why Monis was not on any counter-terrorism watchlist.

The self-proclaimed cleric was well known to ASIO and federal and NSW police after a string of alleged crimes and sending threats to the families of dead Australian soldiers.

He was on bail with an accessory-to-murder charge related to his ex wife's death. 

As recently as Sunday he railed against Australian 'terrorism' on his website, vowing to fight the 'oppression and terrorism of USA and its allies including UK and Australia'.

'We want to know why he wasn't being monitored given his history of violence, his history of mental instability and his history of infatuation with extremism,' Mr Abbott said.

The dead gunman was facing up to 50 sexual offence charges before he carried out the siege 

He held 17 hostages captive inside the Lindt cafe in Martin Place for almost 17 hours 

Four people were wounded and two people were killed as the siege came to an end after 2:00am on Tuesday

On Monday five hostages managed to escape and run to the protection of armed police 

It was impossible to monitor everyone all the time so security agencies made judgments about who posed the most risk, he said.

The threshold for placing someone on a watchlist was whether they were regarded as being at risk of committing violence against innocent people.

However, federal police and spies are unlikely to shed much light on why  Monis was not on a security watchlist when they are questioned by MPs on Wednesday. 

Senior officials from the Australian Federal Police and ASIO will appear before a national security committee on Wednesday to face questions over the government's proposed metadata retention laws.

But the committee chairman, Liberal Dan Tehan, is playing down the prospect that they will be offering answers on Monis.

'It might be that there are some questions regarding this new piece of legislation and how if we can retain data, how that might help in these types of situations,' Mr Tehan told ABC radio.

'But as far as the government is concerned I'm sure the prime minister will want to make sure that there is a methodical, thorough pertinent investigation of what has occurred.' 

Mr Tehan was asked how data retention powers, which would require telcos to retain certain data for two years, could have prevented the Lindt cafe siege.

'We need every tool to cope with these lone wolf attacks,' he said.

'It might not be the sole thing that can prevent these lone wolf attacks, but it is part of a suite of measures that is necessary.'
