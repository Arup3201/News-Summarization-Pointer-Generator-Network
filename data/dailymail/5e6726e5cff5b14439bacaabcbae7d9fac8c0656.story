Tragic: Abigail Bott, 18, was found dead in her dorm room on Sunday afternoon

A 18-year-old student at Indiana University has been found dead in her dorm room.

Campus police are investigating the death of Abigail Bott, who was discovered unresponsive on Sunday afternoon at McNutt Quad, a student house facility that is home to many out-of-state students.

Emergency workers attempted to revive her, but could not. She was declared dead a short time later.

Bott was from the Chicago suburb of Claredon Hills, Illinois.Â 

She moved to Bloomington, Indiana, to start school at IU in August and was a freshman.

Police told the Indianapolis Star that they do not expect foul play in her death, but are conducting a full investigation.

It is not yet known how Bott died. The coroner will conduct an autopsy to determine a cause of death.

Bott is the second freshman student to die at IU since classes began this fall.

Rachael Fiege, 19, died in August after she fell down a flight of stairs at a booze-fueled off-campus party before classes even started.

Authorities say she bashed her head and died hours later from the brain injury.

Bott's friends tweeted out their remorse after learning of her death.

'To the girl who lit up every room, rest in peace... we now have another angel looking down on us,' tweeted Katherine Treankler.

Shawana Rani wrote: 'We had such big dreams for the future and I don't know if I can do it without you, but I hope I can make you proud.'

The university is making counselors available to students who knew Bott and are struggling to deal with her death.
