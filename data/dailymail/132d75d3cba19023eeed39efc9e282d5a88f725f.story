Eleven NHS trusts judged to have achieved a standard of excellence would not attain the status if they applied for it today, MPs have been told.

David Bennett, chief executive of regulator Monitor, said that eleven trusts which are in serious financial difficulties would not achieve foundation trust status - a supposed marker of excellence in the health service - if they were assessed today.

David Bennett, chief executive of regulator Monitor admits they 'got it wrong' in some cases

The 11 trusts are in serious breach of the terms of their authorisation, he told the Public Accounts Committee.

'There are eleven trusts which would not meet the criteria today,' he said.

The Monitor website reveals varied reasons for the breaches in terms of the authorisation of the trusts.

Monitor
found that the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn was responsible 
for an ongoing failure to plan effectively and to address underlying 
performance issues.

Derby Hospital's trust is criticised for
it's poor financial performance and the fact that the trust’s board 
does not have a strong enough role in scrutinising financial planning.

A further 13 foundation trusts are being scrutinised by the regulator because of their finances, Mr Bennett revealed.

Monitor raised concerns about the trusts after viewing their annual financial plans.

Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS 
Foundation Trust is in significant financial difficulties because of a 
costly private finance initiative (PFI), said Mr Bennett.

Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, one of the 13 trusts being scrutinised by the regulator, is also struggling with PFI repayments.

If the trusts cannot afford the repayments, the bill will fall to the taxpayer, he said.

When Mr Bennett was probed about the lengths Monitor goes to when considering NHS trusts for foundation trust status, he admitted the regulator 'got it wrong' when giving the title to Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.

'We clearly got it wrong in the case of Mid Staffs,' he said.

Two years after Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals received foundation trust status it was found to be in significant breach of its terms of authorisation because of poor finances, he added.

Mr Bennett said: 'I have asked the question, "Can we tell to what extent that they pulled the wool over our eyes during assessment or was it that circumstances changed?".

'It is difficult to tell what is the case' he admitted.
