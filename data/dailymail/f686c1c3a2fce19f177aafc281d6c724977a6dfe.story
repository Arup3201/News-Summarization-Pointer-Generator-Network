After the devastation of losing 16 babies, Maria Pridmore had given up hope of ever becoming a mother.

Over 13 heartbreaking years, she suffered 14 miscarriages, a stillbirth and the death of her son at just two weeks old.

But now the 32-year-old nurse and her partner have their long-awaited family, in the form of seven-week-old Mia Shannon – helped into the world by a daily dose of aspirin.

Miss Pridmore said: ‘Being a mother is better than I ever imagined it could be.

‘After all the miscarriages and the two we lost, I didn’t think it would ever happen.’

Miss Pridmore and her partner, John 
Foran, always wanted children. But each time she became pregnant, their 
joy turned to despair when she miscarried. 

‘It was just horrible. To keep going through it again and again was just agony,’ she said.

‘We were both determined to keep trying, but it put a huge strain on our relationship.’ 

In 2003, the couple suffered the sorrow of stillbirth when their daughter, who they named Shannon, died in the womb.

And six years later, Miss Pridmore gave birth to a son, Kia, who was premature. He died just two weeks after his birth.

As well as taking an emotional toll, 
the losses affected Miss Pridmore’s health, and she suffered two strokes
by the time she was 30. In the end, the couple, from Moulton Seas End, 
Lincolnshire, made the difficult decision to give up on their dream of 
having a family. 

Before the birth of Mia, Maria had endured 14 miscarriages, a stillbirth and the death of a two-week old

But soon afterwards, Miss Pridmore discovered she was pregnant again.

She said: ‘It was a bit of a shock, 
and I didn’t dare to hope it would have a happy ending.’

To add to her 
fears, she was diagnosed with both pre-eclampsia and strep B – a 
potentially deadly combination which causes blood clots to form in the 
placenta, cutting the supply of nourishment to the baby.

Annette Briley, consultant midwife for
baby charity Tommy’s, said: ‘If the placenta isn’t working well, it 
could result in a miscarriage or early birth.’

So Miss Pridmore was instructed to 
take an aspirin a day to make her platelets – the tiny structures in 
blood that help it clot – more slippery and stop them sticking together.

She also received twice-daily 
injections of another blood-thinning drug, Clexane, and was ordered to 
stay in bed throughout her pregnancy, with the exception of weekly trips
to the hospital for scans. 

Doctors at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston,
Lincolnshire, were forced to perform an emergency Caesarean after Miss 
Pridmore suffered further complications days before the baby was due.

But despite everything, Mia arrived healthy and happy on January 16, weighing 4lb 12oz.
Mr Foran, 35, said: ‘I really don’t know how to put into words what I felt.

‘It doesn’t compensate for what has happened in the past, but it makes it a bit easier.’ 

Miss Pridmore added: ‘It  goes to show you can never give up hope.’
