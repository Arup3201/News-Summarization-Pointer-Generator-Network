The 
pregnant girlfriend of one of the Toulouse gunman's victims has said she will marry her murdered
partner in a posthumous ceremony.

Caroline
Monet, 21, has been given presidential permission to wed 25-year-old 
Corporal Abel Chennouf, who was shot dead by Mohammed Merah at a cash machine in the town 
of Montauban, near Toulouse, this month.

Her lawyer, Gilbert Collard, said Ms Monet had received approval from President Nicolas Sarkozy for the ceremony to take place.

Posthumous marriages are unusual in France, but they can be sanctioned in ‘grave circumstances’, said Mr Collard.

'I’ve already had it done twice, for policemen’s girlfriends,' he said. 'It’s a really moving ceremony with an empty chair representing the dead spouse.

'There won’t be any problems with approval, and the marriage will allow the new child to have a father.'

The brother of Toulouse gunman Merah appeared before an anti-terrorist judge today and was formally charged with ‘complicity in murder’.

Meanwhile the fall-out from last week's massascre has led to an escalation in religious tension, with Jewish graves being desecrated across France.

Riot police have also been called to housing estates on the
outskirts of major cities like Paris because of anti-Semitic demonstrations
being held in support of the 23-year-old killer.

Mohammed Mereh killed three schoolchildren, a rabbi and three paratroopers

Abdelkader Merah, the 29-year-old brother of Mohammed, appeared in court today after allegations that he was close to a Jewish school last Monday when his 23-year-old sibling gunned down a Rabbi, his two children, and a teenage pupil.

He is also believed to have assisted his brother in an attack on French paratroopers, which saw three shot dead.

Under conditions of utmost security in central Paris this morning, Abdelkader Merah was driven to the Palais de Justice in an armoured convoy.

There a criminal investigation was opened which could see the self-confessed Islamic extremist jailed for life.

In a statement read out soon afterwards, the Paris Prosecutor’s Office said: ‘The investigations being handled by the police have established the existence of serious evidence against Abdelkader Merah corroborating, or making plausible, his participation as an accomplice in the commission of crimes in connection with a terrorist enterprise.’

Abdelkader was remanded in custody, and taken to a high-security prison in Paris, where he is likely to remain until his trial.

Adbelkader has already told police interrogators that he was ‘very proud’ of what Merah did, and admitted to dining with him just before the attack on the Ozar Hatorah school in Toulouse.

‘Signals from Abdelkader’s mobile phone were emitted close to the school at the time of the murders,’ said an investigating source.

Among numerous questions Abedelkader 
is facing is how Merah got hold of an arsenal of weapons, including an 
Uzi sub-machine gun, and even the kind of Sten gun used by British 
soldiers during the Second World War.

It is also believed that Abdekkader 
also helped his brother buy the Yamaha T-Max motorbike used in all the 
attacks, and to respray the vehicle and remove its tracking device.

Meanwhile, new video footage released by police shows the inside of the Toulouse apartment 
where Mohammed Merah had his last stand.

The chaotic flat is cluttered 
with furniture strewn across each room blocking the way, and one wall is
peppered in what looks like bullet holes.

Merah is being held up as an martyr 
in some quarters, with Jewish cemeteries targeted in attacks which 
police are linking to the Merah atrocities.

On Thursday night Stars of David - a 
symbol of Judaism - were torn off some 30 graves in the eastern Jewish 
cemetery in the Mediterranean city of Nice.

Lanterns were also stolen from more 
than 20 sealed tombs in the same cemetery, with local police 
commissioner Hergot Nicolas saying all were targeted 'because they are 
Jewish, while Christian graves nearby were ignored.'

David Shoushana, the chief rabbi in 
Nice, said there had been similar attacks on other cemeteries since 
Merah was shot dead on Thursday, adding that there was a 'possible 
connection with the Toulouse killings.'

Also on Thursday, graffiti including 
'Long Live Merah' and 'Vengeance!' appeared on a prominent wall in the 
Paris suburb of Sartrouville as youths gathered to 'honour' the killer.

'They were mainly kids who are trying to make a political point out of these horrific crimes,' said a local police spokesman.

'Police have broken up similar 
gatherings on other estates around Paris, and other cities, where Merah 
is being portrayed by a tiny minority as martyr.'

A teacher from Rouen, in northern 
France, was also suspended after organising a minute's silence for 
Merah, saying he was a 'victim' who had a difficult childhood on an 
immigrant housing estate in Toulouse.

Merah, who filmed himself carrying 
out the executions of four Jewish people and three French soldiers who 
had fought in Afghanistan, was a self-styled Jihadist.

He said he wanted to kill Jewish 
children in revenge for the lives of Palestinian youngsters who had died
at the hands of the Israeli army.

Victims: Imad Ibn-Ziaten, 30, Abel Chennouf, 25, and Mohamed Legouade, 26 were killed by Merah last week

There are some 500,000 Jews in 
France, and security measures around them have increased after Merah 
shot a rabbi and three children at a school in Toulouse last Monday.

There are some six million Muslims 
living in France, making up the largest group of its kind in western 
Europe, but Islamic leaders have rejected Merah as being utterly 
unrepresentative of a largely peace-loving and law-abiding community.

Mohammed Merah was gunned down by 
special forces outside his council flat in Toulouse last Thursday 
following a fierce firefight.

Abelkader had been arrested the day 
before along with his 30-year-old wife - who has not been named - and 
the brothers’ divorced mother, Zoulika Aziri, 54.

At one point, police brought his mother to the scene, but she refused to urge her son to surrender, officials said.

Both women have now been released, 
and have expressed shock at the decision to charge Adbelkader, who 
denies having anything to do with his brother’s crimes.

Evidence has also emerged that Merah was in touch with British Jihadists preparing terrorist atrocities across the world.

During a visit to Afghanistan just 
over a year ago, Merah was using the codename ‘Youssef Toulouse’, which 
was passed to the UK authorities.

Paris security sources believe that 
both Merah brothers were involved in two local Islamist organisations, 
Forsane Alizza (The Knights of Pride) and a more militant jihadist 
network known as the Toulouse group, or Jund al-Khalifah.

Jund al-Khalifah, an Al-Qaeda 
splinter group, has already admitted to working with a ‘Youssef the 
Frenchman’ - who is believed to be Merah.

‘Not only were members of these 
groups in touch with British Jidhadists while in Europe, but they would 
have met them in Afghanistan,’ said one security source in the French 
capital.

‘There is a window as later as 2010 when Merah would have been in touch with Jihadists from all over the world.’

The source said that Merah was known 
to have entered Kabul, the Capital of Afghanistan on November 13th 2010,
after a journey across Turkey and Iraq.

He was picked up by American security
agents in the Afghan city of Kandahar on November 30th , and returned 
to France on December 5th 2010.

The Toulouse group, which brought 
together young fundamentalists of North African descent, was formed in 
around 2006, with the stated aim of targeting western interests in 
Europe, and sending recruits to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The French authorities are facing 
growing criticism that Merah, a known fundamentalist who was on the U.S.
no-fly list and had attended an al-Qaeda training camp, was left alone 
to carry out his crimes.
