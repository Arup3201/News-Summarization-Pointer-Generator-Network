In-flight meals can be unappetising at the best of times so it’s always a good idea to bring along some snacks if you are going to be in the air for a while.

The problem is, when you’re confined to a little seat on a fighter jet hurtling through the clouds at the speed of sound and the pilot is holding a chocolate bar, just how can you get your hands on it?

Well a pilot and his navigator found the perfect way without having to take their eyes off the sky, and captured the moment on camera.

The pilots appear to be part of the US Navy, judging by their helmets, but little is known about the origin of the video. 

The pilot lets go of the chocolate bar to allow the gravitational pull to transport it to his navigator

Holding a Snickers chocolate bar in his hand, the pilot lets go and allows the gravitational force to do the rest.

Waiting with an outstretched arm, as the chocolate bar floats behind the pilot, the navigator reaches out and after a little bit of scrabbling manages to catch it in his hands.

Throwing it back up in the air before catching it again the navigator waves the bar around in celebration and the pilot gives him the thumbs up in approval.

Floating in the air, the chocolate begins its journey towards the navigator who waits with an outstretched hand 

On its way: The navigator scrambles for the chocolate bar as it floats towards him and manages to catch it

The fact that it was uploaded to an empty Youtube account however has brought about speculation that the video is a commercial for Snickers.

But it may just be a way for the two pilots to keep their identity a mystery while having some fun.

Weightlessnes like this occurs when there are no external objects touching the chocolate bar and exerting a push or pull upon it.

When in a state of free fall like the pilots, the only force acting upon the snack is gravity – a non-contact force.

And since gravity cannot be felt without any other opposing forces, there is no sensation of it present.
