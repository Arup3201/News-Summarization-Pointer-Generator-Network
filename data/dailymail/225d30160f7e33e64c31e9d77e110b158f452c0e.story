It looks like a home fit for an Ewok.

But visitors hoping to catch sight of the Star Wars characters will have to settle for spectacular views of the Bavarian forests instead.

This real-life Ewok-style tree walk is the longest in the world at an incredible 1,300 metres.

Egg-cellent! At a cost of over three million euros - around £2.6million - the walk takes visitors above the Bavarian Forest National Park up to heights of over 140 feet

Visitors can study the wildlife and plants from a 360 degree angle as they scale the curved structure that surrounds trees

The 4,265 foot-long structure takes tourists on a journey through the canopy in Neuschönau, Germany.

At
a cost of over three million euros - around £2.6million - the walk 
takes visitors above the Bavarian Forest National Park up to heights of 
over 140 feet.

It's so high that in high winds or storms the walkway has to be shut in case people are blown over the edge.

At the centre of the amazing structure is the unique tree tower which has been ingeniously constructed around three 33-metre tall fir trees.

More than 500m long, a ramp winds its way up to the top, where visitors admire everything from the trunk to the crowns of the trees.

But it's not only plants that visitors can admire - a rich variety of animal life awaits them.

Mosses, insects, small animals and birds can be watched from a completely different point of view.

Over the mountains of Lusen and Rachel a sea of trees of the Bavarian and Bohemian Forest unfolds itself over hundreds of kilometres.

On a clear and sunny day even the northern alps lie in front of the visitors view.

Ewoks are hunter-gatherers that look like teddy bears and live in various tree-huts and primitive dwellings. They first appeared in George Lucas' film Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.

Don't look down! The walkway has strong nets and some parts it are see-through, meaning visitors can see the woods from every angle
