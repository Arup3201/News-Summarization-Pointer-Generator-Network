A letter to Father Christmas dating back nearly a century has been found lodged in the chimney of a boarding school where it was sent by an enthusiastic young girl.

The flame-singed note, written by a schoolgirl called Haly, asks Santa for a copy of a novel and a new dress, and was apparently sent in or shortly after 1922.

It was found lodged inside a chimney at Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls, in South Wales, by a caretaker who was clearing out the fireplace after raven chicks had been nesting in it.

The letter was initially almost illegible because of the damage caused by exposure to years of smoke, but after it was restored it could be read once again.

It was addressed to 'Daddy Xmas', and read in full: 'Dear Father Christmas, are you coming to see me again in two weeks' time I suppose?

'Tell Mummy I want a book, Tell England, and an evening dress. Love, Haly H XXX'.

Tell England, a novel about the First World War by Ernest Raymond, was published in 1922 - leading school officials to assume that the letter is likely to have been written soon afterwards.

Haly was probably around 10 or 11 years old at the time of the letter, because the bulding where it was found has always been a boarding house for girls of that age.

Illegible: But the letter from a girl called Haly H could eventually be deciphered after it was restored

School caretaker Andy Beddoes found the note in October when he was vacuuming inside the chimney and realised there was something resting on a ledge.

'I pulled it out and saw it was a folded bit of paper and because I’m curious, I tried to read it,' he said.

'I could see "Dear Father Christmas" and the dress bit but that was all. It's a lot cleaner now but you still can't find a date on it.

'I was just surprised really that it hadn't been destroyed. I found it tucked up on the top ledge - it's quite a lucky find.'

Delight: Pupils at the school have been trying to check up other chimneys to see if there's anything inside

Housemistress Liz Price said that the pupils had been trying to explore other chimneys in the school to see what treasures might be hidden inside.

'The girls were so excited about the letter,' she said. 'I think reading something like this makes them appreciate what they have more.

'You can tell them until you're blue in the face about how people in the old days didn't have as much as they do today, but actually reading this letter and seeing that all the girl asked for was a book and a dress made it more real.'

Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls was founded in 1892, and moved to its present site in the town of Monmouth, near the border between England and Wales, five years later.

The school accepts girls between the ages of seven and 18, with fees of nearly £26,000 a year for boarders.
