A policeman today told an inquest how he shot a bodybuilder with a 50,000-volt Taser gun four times in less than a minute.

Dale Burns collapsed after PC Kevin Milby repeatedly shocked him with the electric weapon, and struck his head on a TV cabinet.

The officer and two colleagues had been attempting to subdue the muscle-bound Mr Burns, who had been rampaging around his flat in a drug-fuelled craze.

The 27-year-old died two hours after he was Tasered four times in 52 seconds and was attacked with pepper spray.

However, Mr Milby told the inquest into his death that he had taken the time to assess whether or not the Taser hits were having an effect.

Mr Burns, a father of two, was described as a 'gentle giant but with a drug habit' who regularly took steroids and ecstasy pills while working as a nightclub bouncer.

He had also used cannabis and snorted cocaine, and tried to take his own life after suffering from depression in the months before his death.

On the day he died he told police he had taken a 'gram of Madcat', an illegal drug, the inquest into his death in Kendal, Cumbria heard.

Police were called to Mr Burns's rented flat in Barrow-in-Furness on August after receiving reports he was trashing the bathroom of the property.

Mr Milby, who was authorised to use a Taser, led the team of six officers who found him inside wild-eyed and semi-naked.

'Immediately I could tell he appeared to be under the influence of some sort of drugs,' Mr Milby told the hearing.

'His eyes were rolling in the back of his head and pupils dilated. He was making sudden, jerky movements.

'I asked him what he had taken. He replied, "Madcat".'

Mr Milby, with two colleagues, decided they would have to arrest Burns for criminal damage but were also concerned at the way he was behaving, the inquest heard.

Mr Burns then began to throw clothes and other objects out of the window into the street below before Mr Milby said he was forced to use his Taser as the suspect bore down on him in the lounge of the one-bed flat.

'He turned towards me, he had both fists clenched... grinding down on his teeth. As he approached I decided to self-authorise the Taser and discharged it at him.

'It was my belief he posed a danger to me and other officers and himself. He was becoming increasingly aggressive. I feared for my personal safety at that time.'

Mr Milby said he did not have time to shout a warning to Mr Burns, who fell back, then forwards, and hit his head on the TV cabinet as he went down.

The first shot was timed automatically by the device at exactly 6.50pm and each Taser blast is a pulse of electric shock lasting five seconds.

So with the next shot timed at 6.50pm and eight seconds, there was a gap of just three seconds between the end of the first blast and the start of the next.

Jonathan Hough QC, counsel for the coroner, asked the officer if he should have waited before pulling the trigger again so soon after the first blast.

'I would say it would be unsafe for all parties to do so,' he replied.

Mr Burns was then pepper sprayed in the face before Mr Milby fired his Taser again at 6.50pm and 36 seconds.

As his two colleagues continued to struggle to get the handcuffs on Mr Burns, the officer pulled the trigger for the final time at 6.50pm and 52 seconds.

Mr Milby then put his Taser back in his holster and, with Mr Burns still thrashing his arms and legs, helped his colleagues to bind the suspect at the ankles and wrists with cuffs and leg restraints.

Mr Burns was taken to Furness General Hospital in Barrow, where medics administered diazepam at 7.35pm, and he calmed down.

But he then suffered a heart attack, and despite hospital staff and a police officer giving him CPR for 40 minutes, he was pronounced dead at 8.41pm.

The inquest is scheduled to last up to three weeks.
