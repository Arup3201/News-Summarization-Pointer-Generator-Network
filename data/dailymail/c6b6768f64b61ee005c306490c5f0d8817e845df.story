Speaking out: Tory business and education minister Matthew Hancock has urged bosses to hire Britons rather than immigrants

Firms have a duty to hire Britons rather than immigrants, a minister declared last night.

Matthew Hancock urged bosses to avoid the ‘easy option’ of filling jobs with foreign workers when they could train local recruits instead.

Courting controversy, the Tory business and education minister insisted that taking on British employees was better both for firms and the wider economy.

The Coalition’s immigration clampdown means foreigners now take 55 per cent of vacancies compared with 74 per cent under Labour when Gordon Brown pledged ‘British jobs for British workers’.

But Mr Hancock believes firms can bring the figure even lower.

‘As vacancies rise, and unemployment falls further, it is the duty of companies, especially big business, to take on local young people – not immediately take the easy option of recruiting from abroad,’ he said.

His intervention reflects official fears of an influx of Romanians and Bulgarians when restrictions on their rights to work here end in January.

Mr Hancock rejected a claim from the independent Office of Budget Responsibility that 60,000 foreign workers are needed annually to keep national debt at sustainable levels.

‘I don’t agree,’ he told the Mail. ‘Immigration without support for people who are here masks problems.

'It doesn’t solve them. The jobs are increasingly there – we’ve got record numbers of jobs.

‘What we are talking about is making sure local people have a chance to get them.

‘It is sometimes harder to take on a young unemployed local person but, in the long term, it’s better for the business and it’s better for the whole economy.

‘The evidence shows that if you take on somebody and put them through an apprenticeship or a traineeship, you get somebody who has an attachment to the company which has given them a chance, and you get higher morale not only among the people you take on but also existing staff.

‘They know a company is doing right by the local community.’

Mr Hancock, who is a close ally of Chancellor George Osborne, said he understood why so many firms had taken on immigrants.

But he added: ‘To build a strong, long-term economy we have got to play our part in government and businesses need to take their responsibility.

'The jobs are increasingly there – we’ve got record numbers of jobs. What we are talking about is making sure local people have a chance to get them.'

‘The easiest way for me to get a group of business people to nod their heads is to say that for far too long people coming out of our education system haven’t had what it takes to hold down a job.

‘It’s about the correct attitude, as well as skills in English and maths. We are doing a series of things in terms of reform of education and welfare to address this and we are supporting apprenticeships and traineeships for those who need better skills.’

Mr Hancock, who is responsible for skills and has posts in both the business and education ministries, said the Government would launch a traineeship scheme next month to improve English and maths skills.

He added: ‘We need employers to play their part because experience of a job is vital for getting a job.

‘We are making it as easy as possible for employers to play their part so they have no excuse for not taking on and training up young unemployed people.

‘Many companies do this already – McDonald’s has a strong apprenticeship scheme, as do many manufacturers like JLR and BAe. Companies like HSBC, Brompton bicycles and Mercedes are backing the new traineeships.

‘But only 7 per cent of companies currently have an apprentice.

'It would be wrong for companies without an apprenticeship scheme to recruit from overseas without looking at what they can do to take on local people.’

Several European countries have recently imposed some limited immigration controls  on EU nationals – controls  that are legally permitted by the EU in ‘exceptional circumstances’.

In 2011, Spain won the right to reintroduce immigration controls on Romanian migrants as unemployment soared.

David Cameron has set out plans to reinforce rules restricting access to benefits, the NHS and social housing for European immigrants.

Ministers are introducing a healthcare levy expected to be at least £200 a year to ensure migrants contribute toward the cost of NHS care.

EU law requires companies to consider applications for vacancies from EU nationals.

But employers can say they need fluent English speakers for a job and reject a foreign worker on those grounds.

The Government has introduced a cap on the number of skilled workers from outside the EU, in an effort to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’.

There have been calls for a crackdown on employment agencies that focus on immigrant workers.
