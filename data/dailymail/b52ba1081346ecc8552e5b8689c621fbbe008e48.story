Fans of The Lego Movie have reacted angrily after the hit film was snubbed in the Oscar nominations announced yesterday morning.

Some are branding the rejection 'a disgrace' while others have called it a 'travesty' after the movie, which was hugely popular with audiences, grossed more than £300million worldwide.

The film's directors, who won the Best Animated Feature gong at yesterday's Critics' Choice Movie Awards in Hollywood, tweeted their mixed emotions to being overlooked by the Academy before receiving hundreds of supportive messages.

Snubbed: Lego Movie directors Christopher Miller (L) and Philip Lord (R) accept the Best Animated Feature gong at yesterday's Critics' Choice Movie Awards in Hollywood, alongside producer Dan Lin.  But their film was overlooked by the Oscars

Philip Lord posted a picture of an Oscar statuette made out of Lego with the caption 'it's okay, made my own!' - in response to a wave of tweets from fans angered by the film being snubbed by the Academy.

He also posted: 'This is not a tragedy. Congrats to incredible crew and cast of The Lego Movie, who made a classic.'

But his co-director, Chris Miller, had earlier tweeted: 'Congrats to 'Everything is Awesome' though currently the title of the song doesn't seem especially accurate!'

Mr Miller was referring to the Lego Movie's soundtrack 'Everything is Awesome' - which did receive an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song at the 87th Academy Awards on February 22.

Response: Director Philip Lord posted a picture of an Oscar statuette made out of Lego with the caption 'it's okay, made my own!' in response to a wave of messages from fans angry that the film was snubbed

He added: 'Thanks all for the outpouring of love for the LEGO Movie today. We didn't make it for awards, we made it to be a trending topic on Twitter.'

The Lego Movie was surprisingly overlooked in the category for Best Animated Feature at the 2015 Oscars. 

Here are the films that were nominated:

1. Big Hero 6

2. The Boxtrolls

3. How to Train Your Dragon 2

4. Song of the Sea

5. The Tale of Princess Kaguya 

The movie was the first produced by Warner Animation Group and is an international co-production of the United States, Australia, and Denmark. 

Based on the Lego construction toys, the film tells the story of Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary Lego figure prophesied to save the universe from the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell) as he gains different allies along the way.

Following the Academy's shock announcement, angry fans immediately flooded Twitter with messages of support for the Lego Movie, which was the highest-grossing film of 2014 in the UK.

One user, @Ragnarok12, wrote: 'No #Oscars2015 nomination for the lego movie??? Are you kidding me? How much did Disney pay the Academy?!'

Another user, John McCready, posted: 'Just seen the Lego movie wasn't nominated for the Oscars #disgrace.'

Bittersweet: Co-director Chris Miller posted a message congratulating the producers of the film's soundtrack 'Everything Is Awesome' after it was nominated for Best Original Song, but was clearly surprised by the movie being overlooked in the Best Animated Feature category

Huge hit: The Lego Movie took more than £300million worldwide and was the highest grossing film in the UK in 2014

And @RuckingGray wrote: 'Did the makers of #LegoMovie do something to p*** off the Oscar panel? Absolute travesty, earned best animated pic.'

The snub means the film's Australian animators, Animal Logic, will go unrecognised.

The 2007 Oscar winners for Happy Feet are known for their work on Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, X-Men: Days of Future Past and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. 

1. The Lego Movie: £34.27m

2. The Inbetweeners 2: £33.33m

3. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes: £32.63m

4. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1:  £29.46m

5. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies: £28.71m

6. Guardians of the Galaxy: £28.51m

7. X-Men: Days of Future Past: £27.05m

8. How to Train Your Dragon 2: £25.01m

9. The Amazing Spider-Man 2: £24.06m

10. Paddington: £23.91m

Meanwhile, Philip Lord and Chris Miller, who also directed 21 Jump Street and 22 Jump Street, are currently writing the script for a The Lego Movie sequel - while a Lego Batman film also in the works.

The Lego Movie topped UK box office rankings in 2014, making £34.27 million in ticket sales.

It beat runner-up The Inbetweeners 2 by more than £1 million in takings - while Dawn of the Planet of the Apes came third, grossing £32.63 million.

Films that made the cut for Best Animated Feature at next month's ceremony included Big Hero 6, How To Train Your Dragon 2, The Boxtrolls, Song of the Sea and The Tale of Princess Kaguya.

Little-known Song of the Sea was the big surprise in the category.

Produced by Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon, the movie is based around the ancient Celtic legend of the selkie - a mythological creature which takes the form of a beautiful woman on land and a seal when in the sea.
