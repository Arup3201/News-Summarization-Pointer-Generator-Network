The disgraced captain of the Costa Concordia which ran into a rock and capsized off the Italian coast in January, killing up to 32 people, has sued for wrongful dismissal.

Italian Francesco Schettino was not only fired by Costa Cruises but is accused by prosecutors of causing the accident by sailing the luxury cruiser liner too close to shore.

He faces charges of multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship and preliminary hearings will begin on Monday.

Decision: Francesco Schettino is pictured left today. An Italian court will begin hearings tomorrow to determine who could stand trial for a cruise ship disaster that left 32 people dead

Probe: Francesco Schettino is pictured centre today. Schettino, five crew members and three managers from ship owner Costa Crociere are under investigation

Lawyer 
 Bruno Leporatti said: iIt is the right of every worker to appeal 
against his dismissal and Captain Schettino has done no more than 
exercise that right.

'There 
is nothing to contest or be amazed about, unless we want to say that 
what the law allows for all citizens doesn't apply for Francesco 
Schettino.'

Schettino was held up to ridicule following the January 13 disaster off the Tuscan island of Giglio.

His name became a symbol of incompetence and cowardice and he was given the nickname Captain Coward.

The
 angry order to 'Get back on board, damn it!' delivered by a coast guard
 officer to Schettino over the telephone after he had abandoned his ship
 was printed on T-shirts in Italy.

Fighting back: Francesco Schettino, the disgraced captain of the Costa Concordia which ran into a rock and capsized off the Italian coast in January, killing up to 32 people, has sued for wrongful dismissal

Trial: Schettino faces charges of multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship and preliminary hearings will begin on Monday

Sunk: The liner crashed into rocks. Schettino then claimed he accidentally escaped prematurely by 'tripping' into a life boat

Dangerous: The Costa Concordia ran into trouble after sailing too close to the tiny Tuscan island of Giglio, Italy

Investigators
 said Schettino brought the 950ft-long vessel too close to shore, 
delayed evacuation and lost control of the operation during which he 
left the sinking ship while many of the 4,200 passengers and crew were 
still on board.

The 
Naples-born captain has always acknowledged making mistakes once it 
became clear that the 144,400-tonne Costa Concordia was in trouble.

But he 
has said he was not the only one who should be blamed for the tragedy.
