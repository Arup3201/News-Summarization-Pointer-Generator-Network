Netflix now accounts for more than a third of all internet traffic during peak evening hours in North America, according to new research.

The movie and TV streaming service is responsible for a staggering 35 percent of all bandwidth usage while the second most popular, YouTube, accounts for just 14 percent.

After Netflix, YouTube, web surfing and Facebook, home internet users' favorite applications include BitTorrent, iTunes, Amazon and Hulu, according to networking company Sandvine's latest edition of its biannual Global Internet Phenomena Report.

Home broadband users are using 30 percent to 40 percent more data than last year, with typical consumers using 20 Gigabytes monthly.

Netflix’s streaming service has long dominated downstream internet usage - a point that’s sparked battles between it and Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon, which have argued Netflix should pay up for the bandwidth it uses.

HBO Go, the streaming version of the US premium cable channel HBO, just missed the top 10, accounting for 1% of usage. That number will almost certainly go up once a standalone internet version of HBO Go becomes available sometime next year.

Amazon Instant Video is also beginning to pick up steam, though its share is still minuscule compared with Netflix’s, and the service is currently not even available in Canada.

‘With both Netflix and Amazon Instant Video gaining bandwidth share in North America during 2014, it will be fascinating to see how a standalone HBO Go streaming option will impact networks when it launches in 2015,’ said Sandvine president and CEO Dave Caputo in a statement.

‘The dynamic streaming video market underscores how important it is that operators around the globe have the business intelligence and big data solutions in place to understand the ever-changing behavior of their subscribers.’

These figures don’t account for internet connections made via cellular data networks on mobile devices.

On that front, YouTube is the leader with a 19.75 percent share, and Facebook is right behind it with a 19.05 percent share.

Facebook saw its mobile and fixed traffic go by 60 percent and more than 200 percent, respectively, after adding its Autoplay video feature in September, Sandvine said.
