Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu has said the club are in the market for 'a forward and defenders' as they continue their efforts to sign Luis Suarez from Liverpool.

The Catalan giants are looking to rebuild after finishing last season without a major trophy, the first time that has happened in six years.

And, as Liverpool and Barcelona officials meet to discuss a deal for Suarez, Bartomeu has confirmed that the club are looking to add a striker to their side.

The Barcelona president said: 'We have the names and the players, but sometimes there are clubs who speculate over possible signings by Barca to manipulate the price. All I can say is that they are names that have been agreed with (new coach) Luis Enrique and they excite us.'

Bartomeu added: 'For example, (sporting director Andoni) Zubizarreta already has the names of the centre backs although they are not signed yet as there are clubs who think their value will go up after the World Cup.'

Barca hired Luis Enrique, a former player with the club, to replace Gerardo Martino, who stepped down after a disappointing debut season in 2013-14.

The team often looked toothless in attack, despite the presence of Lionel Messi and Neymar, and the defence was shambolic at times, conceding far too often from set pieces.

Not only have the Catalans been linked with Suarez, centre-back Jeremy Mathieu is said to be pushing to join from La Liga rivals Valencia.

Bartomeu said some players would have to leave to make way for new arrivals but left open whether midfielder Xavi, who at 34 is coming to the end of a glittering career, would play on for another campaign.

Swap deal? Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez could be moving in the opposite direction to Suarez

'He has won the right to decide what he thinks is right and we will help him however he wants,' Bartomeu said.

'If it was another player we would be the ones saying what he had to do but seeing as it's Xavi we are giving him time. The day he leaves he will pass into history as the most successful player we have ever had.'

Chilean Alexis Sanchez is one man who has been linked with a move away from the Nou Camp, but Bartomeu said that Barcelona were 'counting on him' for next season.
