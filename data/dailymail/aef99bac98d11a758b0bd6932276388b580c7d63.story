Vegetarians look away. If you've ever craved the smell of fast food all day long, Burger King has come up with the ultimate solution with the launch of a new burger-scented cologne.

The cologne will supposedly imitate the signature aroma of the Whopper Burger, which consists of 100 per cent flame-grilled beef, freshly sliced onions, lettuce and mayonnaise.

The scent, which has been named Flame-Grilled, is set to be launched by Burger King Japan on 1 April 2015.

Not for vegetarians: 'Flame-Grilled' will smell like the Whopper Burger: beef, fresh onions, lettuce and mayonnaise

'Flame-Grilled' will set you back 5000 yen - which comes to around £27. Pricey. 

There will also supposedly be a one day promotion, whereby every customer will receive a free Whopper Burger with their purchased perfume bottle. 

It's apt that the release of the perfume would fall on 1 April (April Fools' Day), and many have speculated that the 'launch' is in fact a global practical joke.  

While many people are doubtful of the launch's authenticity, the fast food chain insists that the upcoming release is not a hoax.

In fact, this isn't the first time that it's launched a fragrance. In 2008, Burger King unveiled a men's spray, dubbed Flame, which was promoted as 'the scent of seduction with a hint of flame-broilled meat'.

Flame was only available online and in certain stores in New York, and was discontinued shortly after its launch. 

April Fool's? While many people think that the cologne is a hoax, the advert insists the authenticity of the cologne and sees it retailing for 5000 yen, which is around £27
