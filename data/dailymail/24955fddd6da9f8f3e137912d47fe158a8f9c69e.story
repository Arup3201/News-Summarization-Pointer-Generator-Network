A plane enthusiast restored the cockpit of a Cold War fighter jet and proudly parked it on his driveway.

Neil McCarthy, 37, renovated the nose of the battered Vampire T11 jet for display in front of his family home in Seaton Burn, North Tyneside.

He says his wife Amanda and children Ryan, two,  and Nathan, 18 months, have now grown 'attached' to the piece of history sitting in their driveway.

The Vampire was designed in 1941, but never saw service in World War II because it was still being developed.

It was the first single jet engine fighter produced in the UK and some 3,200 were made.

Mr McCarthy bought the wrecked cockpit for £1,500 at an auction at RAF Millom Aviation and Military Museum in Cumbria.

His plan was met with scepticism from his friends, family and neighbours - but the impressive restoration has made his driveway a popular attraction.

'It's 
just a complete transformation,' said Mr McCarthy, an electronics engineer at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary hospital. 'I've got loads of compliments and because we live right next to the A1 you can see people looking down on it.

The Vampire T11 was the first single jet engine fighter produced in the UK.

It was designed in 1941 and the first prototype was taken on its maiden flight by Geoffrey de Havilland on September 20, 1943, but its on-going development meant it did not see active service in WW2.

The first production Mk 1 Vampire first flew in April 1945. It was small and light because of the low power of early jet engines - its 'Goblin' engine giving just 2100lbs of thrust.

Around 3,200 Vampires were made and the T11, a two seat side-by-side trainer version, was the final version produced.

'The neighbours love it - the ones next 
door have have been showing a lot of interest, saying, "wow, what a
difference" and that they didn't think it would happen.

'I've become best buddies with a guy across the road because of it. It's strange but I think it has made everyone a lot closer.'

The cockpit was used as a gateway display at the museum in Scotland before it was moved to Millom museum 14 years ago.

Mr McCarthy, who already owned a Jet Provost Group, said: 'There was a lot more involved than I first thought.

'Luckily a firm called North Eastern Composites offered to do all the donkey work.

'That was a great help so a big thank you is needed for them.'

He took the cockpit to Cleethorpes Airshow, where it was a huge hit.

'The response was unbelievable,' he said. 'There were people in and out all day long.'

He now intends to add to his collection of 
aircraft with a full-size mock-up of a Spitfire 
cockpit, which will be made into a flight simulator.

But with his driveway now full, he is running out of places to put the simulator, and is appealing to anyone with available space in the area to 
come forward.

Landmark: Mr McCarthy's drive has become a tourist attraction since he placed the restored cockpit there, after buying it for £1,500 at an auction at RAF Millom Aviation and Military Museum
