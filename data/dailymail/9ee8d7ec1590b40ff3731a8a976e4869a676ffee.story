For patriotic Scots, home-produced smoked salmon is as cherished a part of the national heritage as Nessie, kilts and Robbie Burns.

But now, in an astonishing cross-border power grab, politicians in Westminster are seeking to claim the delicacy for England.

Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss has said she believes ‘London Cure Smoked Scottish Salmon’ should have the same legal safeguards as other famous food products such as Melton Mowbray pork pies and Cornish clotted cream. 

Politicians in Westminster are seeking to claim Scottish smoked salmon because of the curing process invented in the East End of London

Not surprisingly, the campaign – the first such bid by the capital – has not gone down well with the Scots, and is likely to leave leading figures north of the border, such as former First Minister Alex Salmond, distinctly unimpressed.

The claim for London, by reputed firm H Forman & Son, is based on the ‘delicate taste and texture’ created by a special smoking cure that has been used in the East End since the 19th Century.

The company’s owner, Lance Forman, said he was delighted to be involved in the application, which would give his company’s product ‘protected food name status’.

But Tom Campbell, who founded Fencebay Smokehouse in Fairlie, Ayrshire, more than 25 years ago, said: ‘Most people recognise that Scottish salmon is the best in the world. I don’t think too many will be swayed by it having London in its name.’

In supporting the application, Ms Truss said: ‘The marriage of a generations-old curing process born in London’s East End and quality Scottish salmon is testament to this country’s amazing food culture.’

Last night a Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ‘We will pay close attention to any application for protected food names that relate to Scottish products.’

A Defra spokesperson said: 'This EU scheme is open to any part of the UK that produces food or drink in a unique fashion distinct to a geographical area - this Government will continue to support any applicants who meet the relevant criteria.

'We were pleased to have supported the successful Scottish Farmed Salmon bid for Protected Food Name status, along with a number of other successful Scottish bids in recent years.'
