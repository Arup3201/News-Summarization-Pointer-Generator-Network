Latvia's president described a supermarket roof collapse that killed at least 54 people as 'murder,' as rescuers searched for as many as 10 more victims believed to be buried in the rubble.

Early reports suggest the roof caved in due to either faulty construction or building work on its grass- and gravel-covered surface, where workers were installing a garden area and children's playground for an adjacent high-rise residential building.

Today Latvia's child welfare department revealed that that 16 children had lost parents in the accident and three of 
them lost both parents.

Tragic: Rescuers searched this morning for 10 missing people who may have been killed in the collapse of a supermarket roof, a disaster which the nation's president described as 'murder'

Cause: Early reports suggest the roof caved in due to either faulty construction or building work on its grass- and gravel-covered surface

Orphans: Laila Rieksta-Riekstina, head of the state's child welfare department, told Latvia Radio that 16 children lost parents in the accident. Three of them lost both parents

President Andris Berzins spoke bluntly about the disaster at the Maxima supermarket in Riga, though he did not single anyone out as culpable.

'This is a case where we need to say 
clearly it is the murder of an enormous number of defenseless people, 
and that's how we should proceed,' Mr Berzins said in an interview with 
Latvian television.

Mr Berzins
called for a speedy investigation to prevent those responsible from 
covering up a paper trail and 'coming off as pure as angels.'

Fifty-four deaths had been confirmed from the structural failure by Saturday afternoon.

Police
spokesman Dairis Anucins said earlier that there were reports of 10 
missing people, and it was not clear if the new death toll included any 
of them.

Token of remembrance: Paintings and flowers are fixed on a fence near the accident site

Grief: Passers by react outside the destroyed Maxima supermarket

Mourning: Latvians streamed to the site in a densely populated neighborhood between downtown Riga and the airport to lay flowers and light candles

Respect: Candles and flowers are laid in front of the Maxima supermarket in Riga

Tragedy: People gather near the collapsed supermarket

Some
40 people were injured, including 13 firefighters who rushed to the 
scene, and 23 people remained hospitalized as of Saturday afternoon, 
police said.

It was the 
worst accident in the Baltic country since it regained independence in 
1991.

The government declared three days of mourning starting Saturday.

Latvians streamed to the site in a densely populated neighborhood 
between downtown Riga and the airport to lay flowers and light candles.

Fatal: Large sections of roof collapsed during the evening shopping rush-hour

Search: Rescue workers had stopped the operation early Saturday to consult with engineers before continuing

Work: Local media said workers had been building a roof garden on the store, a single-storey building located in a Riga suburb about a 30 minute drive from the city centre

Horror: Witnesses said there was a loud noise and the store went dark. People escaped through holes in the windows

Mourning: The government has declared three days of mourning

The
Fire and Rescue Service said only 80 square meters (850 square feet) of
debris remained to be searched as of late Saturday afternoon, but they 
said it was a difficult section with rubble piled up to 4 metres (12 
feet) high.

Rescue workers had stopped the operation early Saturday to consult with engineers before continuing.

Pictures
show that a large amount of building materials, including bags of soil 
for the garden, were left in areas of the roof that Riga city officials 
say could have been vulnerable to heavy loads.

Police have launched an investigation, which could take several weeks to complete.

Riga
Mayor Nils Usakovs wrote in this Twitter account Saturday that once the
investigation is over the supermarket ruins would be razed and a 
monument built to the victims.

He also suggested that the incomplete 
residential building might be torn down.
