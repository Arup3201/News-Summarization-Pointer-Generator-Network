Alex Salmond relaunched his political career yesterday with a boast that his party could hold the balance of power at the next General Election.

The former first minister announced that he intends to stand for Parliament by seeking the SNP’s nomination in the constituency of Gordon.

But he said his Scottish nationalists could emerge as power brokers if no party wins an overall majority in Westminster.

Alex Salmond, who quit as SNP leader hours after losing the independence referendum, said he would 'step up to the plate' and stand for election in the Gordon constituency. He announced the decision at the Buchan Hotel in Ellon (pictured)

In return for propping up a Labour government, he said another independence referendum is likely to be among the SNP’s top demands. 

Claiming there is the ‘prospect of real power for Scotland’ if the SNP wins a significant number of Commons seats, he warned of turning Westminster ‘upside down’.

Mr Salmond stood down as SNP leader and First Minister last month and speculation over his political future has continued ever since.

Today he revealed will stand in the Gordon constituency, a seat that shares some areas with his Aberdeenshire East Holyrood constituency, and is currently represented by Liberal Democrat Sir Malcolm Bruce, who is retiring in May.

Mr Salmond said: 'In the weeks since the referendum the people of Scotland have refused to give up on the hope of a better Scotland.

'For those who voted Yes the referendum offered the possibility of real change. For many who voted No they insist on the vow being properly redeemed.

'Therefore it is incumbent on all of us to step up to the plate – to match the spirit being shown by the people. Therefore I can tell the constituency today that I am a candidate for the SNP nomination for Gordon.'

Some polls have put the SNP well ahead in Scotland, threatening to reduce Labour to a rump of just a handful of seats.

It raising the prospect of the SNP holding the balance of power if Labour and the Tories fail to secure an overall majority. 

But Mr Salmond insisted the SNP would not do a deal with the Tories in 'any shape or form'.

'There are other possibilities, and in these possibilities a strong group of SNP MPs will have the capacity to rumble up Westminster.'

Mr Salmond said it was 'unlikely' he would sit in a Cabinet with Labour, but ruled nothing out

Asked whether he would sit in a Cabinet with Labour, Mr Salmond told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: 'That is unlikely I would have thought but I'm not ruling it out, I'm just saying it's unlikely.

'I'm actually the only person who has actually run a minority government in these islands incidentally.

'I had four years of doing that in the Scottish Parliament so you learn a great deal when you're on the receiving end of being a minority government and therefore you have some evidence as to how to accept the best possible influence to secure the best possible result for progressive thought across these islands.'

Mr Salmond also played down the prospect of leading the SNP MPs in Westminster.

He said: 'I have been First Minister of Scotland. I have no interest in titles and fully support Angus Robertson who is an excellent leader of the SNP at Westminster, a close friend and a fine MP. 

'I am perfectly content as a constituency member of parliament and will seek to have a role in negotiating the progress for Scotland which would arise from a powerful group of SNP MPs and our allies. 

Nicola Sturgeon has replaced Mr Salmond as SNP leader and Scottish First Minister

Mr Salmond was previously an MP for Banff and Buchan between 1987 and 2010 and will set out his plans in a speech in Ellon, Aberdeenshire, today.

Since the referendum, support for the SNP has swelled and the party's membership has grown from 25,000 to more than 92,000.

Recent polls have also predicted large gains for the party at next year's general election, with one showing the SNP leading Labour by 46 per cent to 26 per cent in Scotland.

Mr Salmond, who remains an MSP, has regularly been asked about his future since stepping down as First Minister but has so far refused to confirm his plans. 

The Gordon seat, which will now become one of the most-watched in next year's general election, was won by the Lib Dems with a majority of 6,748 over the SNP in 2010.

Incumbent MP Mr Bruce said: 'People in Gordon rejected the First Minister's independence plans overwhelmingly at the referendum.

'I am sure that they would be delighted to have the chance to reject him again in May. Bring it on.'

Lib Dem candidate Christine Jardine, who hopes to replace the retiring Mr Bruce as the local MP, said the area had been 'short changed' during Mr Salmond's time as First Minister.

'I'm delighted the former First Minister is set to put an end to the game-playing,' she said.

'The people of Gordon deserve better, just as they deserve an MP who will stand up for what's important to them, not chase their personal political agenda at the cost of what's best for the people of the North East.

'I intend to be a strong voice for all the people of Gordon.'

Alex Salmond is, in his own head at least, Mr Scotland. He was so destined for the role he made sure he was born on Hogmanay, December 31, that great night of Scottish celebration.

He could only have been more pleased if he had shared a birthday with Robert Burns.

But then Salmond is a man who is often pleased with himself. Clubbable to his fans, smug to his critics, there are many who will have delighted at his demise today.

At Alex Salmond's press conference to announce his resignation as First Minister, journalists from unfriendly newspapers were locked out of the room in Bute House

Yet his abilities to charm his supporters and outfox his opponents transformed Scottish politics.

It is a mark of the man that at the press conference to announce his resignation as First Minister hours after his referendum defeat, journalists from unfriendly newspapers were locked out of the room in Bute House.

The referendum campaign was dominated by claims he sought to bully or intimidate those who did not share his enthusiasm for breaking up the Union.

You were either on his side or against him, as the BBC's Nick Robinson discovered when he dared to question the details of his plans for independence.

Critics were dismissed as scaremongers. Facts dismissed as lies, experts flatly ignored.

That was how he ran things, spending 20 of the last 24 years as SNP leader.

When he took charge in 1990, the Scottish Nationalists had just three MPs in Westminster. There was no such thing as a Scottish Parliament.

Now there are six MPs in Westminster, an unprecedented overall majority in Holyrood, and having secured an historic referendum on independence.

He said he wanted to put the future of Scotland in the hands of the Scottish people.

They took his dream of separation and tore it to shreds. But he is a man who refuses to take no for an answer. 

Born in Linlithgow in 1954, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond was educated at Linlithgow Academy and St Andrew's University, where he first joined the SNP.

Graduating with a degree in economics and history, he worked as an economist for both the Government Economic Service and the Royal Bank of Scotland before being elected as an MP for the Banff and Buchan constituency in 1987.

In 1981 he married Moira, 17 years his senior They have no children, and she is rarely seen in public, though she was on hand to smuggle a Saltire past Wimbledon security in her handbag for Salmond to wave when Andy Murray was crowned champion in 2013.

Mr Salmond, who will turn 60 on New Year's Eve, said he had decided to 'step up to the plate' in the interests of Scotland

His election at Westminster followed a turbulent period for the SNP, which saw its number of seats fall from 11 to two in the 1979 general election.

As a young and brash newcomer, Salmond played a role in the breakaway faction of the party known as the '79 Group' which sought to take a more left-wing stance.

His brief expulsion as a result did not hinder his advancement within the party in the long-term, with his election to leader coming in 1990.

With the creation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, Salmond went on to serve as leader of the opposition at Holyrood, while retaining his seat at Westminster.

He stood down as SNP leader in 2000 and left the Scottish Parliament in 2001.

Returning as leader in 2004, he guided the SNP to a narrow Scottish election win in 2007 and then led a minority government as he became Scotland's first SNP First Minister.

With the Tories all-but wiped out in Scotland, and Labour's big beasts serving in Tony Blair's Cabinet in Westminster, few could match Salmond's abilities.

While New Labour viewed Holyrood as a small pond compared to the shark-infested waters of Westminster, Salmond was the biggest fish north of the border.

He rebranded the Scottish Executive as the Scottish Government, greeting David Cameron in Edinburgh like a visiting dignitary, not the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

After the 2011 elections, he bounced Westminster into accepting his claim to have a democratic mandate for a referendum.

A year later he bounced David Cameron into accepting the timing of the referendum, and giving 16 and 17-year-olds the vote.

A Star Trek fan, a keen golfer, an enthusiastic gambler, Salmond has a competitive streak to almost everything, even dieting.

When trying to slim on the 5:2 diet, he boasted how he had shed the pounds faster than Chancellor George Osborne. 

He will turn 60 on Hogmanay this year, and his frequent jokes about his age on the campaign trail hinted at a private unease at this looming milestone.

Yet even as he stood down as First Minister, he made clear voters had not seen the back of him. 'I am not going to withdraw entirely from public life,' he said.

Now we know he will stand to become an MP in Gordon, certain to lead the SNP group in the Commons.

The man who likes to challenge the history books could be about to write another new chapter.
