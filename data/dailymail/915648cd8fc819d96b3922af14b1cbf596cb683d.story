Even a total golfing novice would fancy their chances of getting down in three putts from 4ft yet incredibly it proved beyond the best player in the world at the BMW Championship on Saturday.

Two majors this summer plus two other notable triumphs proved no protection when Rory McIlroy stood over his four footer for a par at the par three 12th – and ended up walking off the green with a triple bogey six.

The 25-year-old powered the first putt 6ft past the hole and was so disgusted when that putt lipped out he lost concentration completely and missed the consequent tiddler as well.

Only in golf can the very best sometimes be reduced to hapless performers like the rest of us.

McIlroy did respond with a birdie at the next but couldn’t repair the damage and had to settle for a 72 that has left him nine shots behind the leader, American Billy Horschel, who shot a fabulous 63.

‘What happened at the 12th completely derailed me,’ admitted McIlroy. ‘I misread the first one, hit a bad putt with the second one and then just lost concentration going for the tap-in. So obviously, from being right there in the tournament, dropping three shots in one hole wasn’t what I wanted.’

After all the great rounds McIlroy has played this summer – this was only his second round over par out of the last 22 – it looked like it all caught up with him a touch here, in his eighth tournament in the last ten weeks.

At the next par three, the 15th, he hit a wicked hook with a five iron you’d never see him play if he was fresh, and had to play his next from within the confines of a hazard to card another bogey.

The good news for McIlroy is he is still in great shape in terms of the $10million (£6.12m) FedEx Cup bonus that will be handed out in Atlanta next Sunday at the Tour Championship. Any player who is in the top five in the FedEx Cup going into that event has control of their own destiny and McIlroy should be one of those. ‘I need to go out and shoot a low one in the final round on Sunday and give myself the best possible chance going to Atlanta,’ he said.

McIlroy wasn’t the only player to suffer on the greens. Halfway leader Sergio Garcia had problems of his own, missing no fewer than five putts under 5ft in a miserable 72 that has left him seven off the pace.

Instead it is US Open Champion Martin Kaymer who leads the European challenge into the final round, as he shot a 64 to stand five behind Horschel in third place. Nearest player to the runaway leader is American Ryan Palmer but even he is three behind. Given this was Horschel’s seventh consecutive round in the 60s – he’s a combined 26 under for the stretch and was runner-up in the Deutsche Bank Championship last Monday – he might take some stopping.

‘I’d have to rate this round as one of the top three of my career,’ said the temperamental Horschel, who has one other PGA Tour victory to his name. ‘I felt like I was in control of all facets of my game all day.’

On a day when his supposed dream team of Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley pulled out in controversial circumstances, US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson will be encouraged that several of his team have the chance to pull off a morale-boosting win going into the final round.

Masters champion Bubba Watson is four behind, with Rickie Fowler six off the pace, while Jim Furyk and Jordan Spieth lie joint seventh, albeit eight behind.

Justin Rose shot 70 to be tied 29th, while Graeme McDowell shot 69, his lowest round of the week, but still remains in tied 49th place.
