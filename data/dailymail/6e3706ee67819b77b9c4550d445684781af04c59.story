This is the heart-stopping moment a teenager scaled a 120ft cathedral and filmed the stunt with a helmet-top camera. 

Jack Bellis from Wrexham, north Wales, has been doing parkour - a form of free running- since he was 13, climbing trains, buildings and obstacles wherever he finds them to practise. 

The 17-year-old decided to climb up Chester Cathedral with his training partner, using scaffolding and walls to launch themselves higher up the building without harnesses.

Footage of the pair has been slammed by police who describe the hobby as dangerous, the teenager's parents are 'very supportive' of his past-time. 

'People might think that my videos do look high risk but everything I do is well within my limits.'

'I have started small and worked my way up to where I am now, it’s a never ending progression. 

'I know not to run before I can walk.

'My family are very supportive of my videos - but sometimes my mum does get worried.'

 Sgt Andy Burrage from Cheshire Police advised people against copying the teenager. 

'Some people may consider these activities impressive, but their behaviour is fraught with very obvious danger.'

The teenager filmed the stomach-churning climb with a camera strapped to his head 

In parkour runners use obstacles around them to launch themselves forward or to move more quickly 

The style of free-running is thought to have been developed in France by the military in the 1980s 

Cheshire police discouraged anyone from copying the stunt at Chester Cathedral (pictured) 

'The boys were stopped by officers and advised regarding their antics - the scaffolding surrounding the 120ft high tower is anything but a playground.

'I would urge anyone considering copycat activities to reconsider, and channel their athleticism in a safer manner.'

Parkour is a form of free running developed in France in the 1980s.

It encourages the runner to use their body as a tool to overcome obstacles in the quickest, most efficient way.
