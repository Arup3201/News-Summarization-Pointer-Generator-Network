Tributes: Friends and family said Fiona Vigar was a passionate believer in country sports

The field master of a fox hunt has died three weeks after falling from her horse while riding with a pack of hounds.

Fiona Vigar, 43, who was a former joint master of the Cattistock Hunt in Dorset, came off her horse while riding through a village and suffered a serious head injury.

Locals rushed to her aide and she was airlifted to hospital in Bristol but never regained consciousness and passed away on Sunday evening.

Mrs Vigar, who had hunted with the group from a very young age, was acting as field master with the Cattistock Hunt when the accident happened on January 24.

Her friends and family paid tribute, describing her as someone who was passionate about country sports.

Friend Liz Elliott said she would be dearly missed in the hunting community.

She added: 'Fiona was a really good friend, I have known her for about 25 years and she was probably my best pal.

'She will never be forgotten, everywhere I go in the countryside reminds me of a conversation we would have had there'.

Mrs Vigar, from Cerne Abbas, Dorset, had raised money in the past for air ambulance charities after being treated following a previous accident.

Her husband, Chris, and sister Penelope Cobbold thanked medical staff, the air ambulance and well-wishers for their help and support.

They said in a statement: 'Fiona has left a huge void in many people's life, but she would not want anybody to dwell on this tragedy.

'Life was always for living in her case, and that is what she would want those that remember her to carry on doing.

'We have been overwhelmed by the support we have received from friends and the local community in general and would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those people'.

Mrs Vigar was airlifted from Loders near 
Bridport and taken to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol where she was put 
into a coma and had immediate brain surgery.

But after almost three weeks in hospital she died.

Mrs Vigar was born in Dorset but had a successful career working for the Ministry of Agriculture in Whitehall before returning in the late 1990s.

She went on to work in agricultural merchanting for Banks Agriculture, Cargill and Frontier Agriculture, and had travelled extensively around the world.
