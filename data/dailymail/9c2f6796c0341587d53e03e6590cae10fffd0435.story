Freed Amanda Knox has revealed for the first time why she refused to look at the horrific photographs of murdered Meredith Kercher during her appeal and how she is 'not the Monster of Perugia.'

Knox, 24, was sensationally released from jail earlier this week, along with her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 27, after being dramatically cleared of killing student Meredith, 21, who was found semi-naked and with her throat cut.

During the trial graphic photographs of her mutilated body were shown to the court by the Kercher family lawyer Francesco Maresca, without the public gallery being cleared and which he justified by saying it was 'necessary to show her suffering.'

Freed Amanda Knox insisted in never before seen notes that the evidence against as to whether she killed Meredith Kercher, right, was always 'unreliable and circumstantial'

In never before seen notes written the
day they were shown Knox said:'I could not bring myself to look at the 
photographs of Meredith's body because I could not stand to see the way 
she had been reduced.

'I never saw Mez (Meredith) dead other than in those photographs which my lawyers showed me and which shocked me. I can't look at them calmly because Mez was my friend.'

Freed Knox then added:'I am not the Monster of Perugia.'

In his closing argument, prosecutor 
Giuliano Mignini had attacked Knox and Sollecito for not looking at the 
photographs - suggesting it was an indication of their guilt.

The notes also reveal how Knox felt 
she had been betrayed by the Italian police and prosecutors - a theme 
she had mentioned in her dramatic and heartfelt plea of innocence just 
before judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman and his jury retired to consider 
their verdict.

Writing in blue biro she said:'Justice
already failed me. Need for justice for Mez parallel, not contrasting ,
with need for justice for me and Raf.

'No history of violence/mental disturbance. Didn't run away (the wicked flee).'

She then added: 'Naive, unable to understand the aggressive insistence of the investigators, unable to defend myself.

'Our lives have been destroyed': Meredith's family have spoken of their agony

'The development of the appeal highlights the fact that the evidence against me is either unreliable or circumstantial.'

This was in reference to the 
independent report carried out by two court appointed experts into the 
DNA findings on two hotly contested pieces of evidence - the 30cm 
kitchen knife found at Sollecito's apartment and a clasp from Meredith's
bloodied bra.

The original trial heard how their was
DNA from Knox on the handle and that of Merdith on the blade but the 
experts said that of the victim was so low that it should be considered 
unreliable and not used to convict her of murder.

While the clasp was found six weeks 
after the murder and there was the very high possibility that the DNA 
from Sollecito found on it was there by cross contamination - these were
the only two elements that put them both at the murder scene.

Knox added in her notes, which were 
written in a mixture of English and Italian, that she was 'naive to 
believe the investigators were unbiased' as she described how she had 
been pressured into wrongly naming bar man Patrick Lumumba as the 
killer.

After hours of questioning she had 
said she had 'covered her ears as Patrick murdered Meredith in her 
bedroom' which led him to being arrested and held in jail for two weeks 
before being released.

At her appeal trial earlier this week 
she was convicted of this slander against him and given three years but 
as she had already spent four in jail she was freed - although she was 
ordered to pay him 22.000 Euro damages.

She said:'The objective of the 
interrogation was to leave me with no choice but to convince me to 
confirm their premeditations against me,' before adding that police are 
making mistakes by not believing their alibis.Â 

Knox also wrote:'No justice for Mez by perpetuating my injustice.'
