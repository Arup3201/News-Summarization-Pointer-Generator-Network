A barmaid who was asked by her manager to show off her breasts in a push-up bra to boost a pub's trade has won £10,000 in compensation.

Kathryn Broughton, 21, was given the nickname 'little t*ts' by her boss Andrew Stephens and asked if she was wearing a push-up bra.

When the shy university graduate failed to reply, the 33-year-old married man told her: 'Well you really should.'

Miss Broughton told an employment tribunal: 'He then said we will get more customers and you will get more tips.'

The part-time barmaid won her claim for sex discrimination after she quit the real ale pub in disgust following a string of rude remarks.

She claimed on-going sexual harassment over a six-month period by Mr Stephens, who is a shareholder in the pub company which runs the Rutland Arms in Sheffield city centre.

Miss Broughton said her boss first called her 'little t*ts' to 'curry favour' with a member of staff with whom he was engaging in banter at the bar and repeated it on several occasions in front of other bar and kitchen staff.

When she was off work sick, Mr Stephens made a comment about her having a sexually transmitted disease and he labelled her boyfriend a transvestite.

In a Facebook message, Miss Broughton was told of a rumour that female bar staff could be asked to wear more revealing tops.

It culminated in her resigning following the incident on June 1, 2010 after Mr Stephens drank at least five pints one evening and was chatting to customers and then kitchen staff at the bar.

He directed the 'push-up bra' comment towards her at the end of the evening and Miss Broughton said: 'I felt upset and degraded and very self-conscious.'

She became aware of her breasts being stared at, she said. 'I was a bit scared. I didn’t want to talk about it to anyone,' she added.

Miss Broughton was so frightened she called her boyfriend to take her home and she immediately quit and fired off a letter of complaint saying she found the remarks inappropriate.

She wrote: 'I found them intimidating and insulting. They were unwarranted and amounted to harassment.'

Her barrister Simon Pallo told the Sheffield hearing: 'She was a young lady in a relatively male-dominated workplace and she’s quite a retiring, shy girl.'

Mr Stephens denied making any sexual comments to the barmaid.

He said she had never raised any grievance with him and he did not make any comments about sexually transmitted infections or call her boyfriend a transvestite.

He said the picture she painted of the Rutland Arms was 'far removed from reality' although they did have nicknames for staff.

One was called 'Fat Paul' although he was slim, there was 'Staring Richard' who stared at people and he himself was called 'Steve the man', but he denied calling Miss Broughton 'little t*ts'.

The tribunal heard a female friend of Miss Broughton’s posted on her Facebook wall a message reading 'tits, tits, I love tits.'

Mr Stephens said: 'Perhaps she is not as adverse in talking to her friends in that way.'

But Miss Broughton said she took it as a joke between friends and it was different if an employer had made such a comment.

The panel decided Miss Broughton’s sex discrimination claim in her favour after a two-day hearing.

Employment Judge John Trayler said in his judgment that the panel believed the comments were made as described by the barmaid although the sexually-transmitted disease remark was not an act of discrimination but 'unwelcome' nevertheless.

Mr Trayler said there was evidence that the physical characteristics of employees at the pub were identified and this was a factor that had to be taken into account.

He said: 'There is a possibility the claimant may have been referred to by Mr Stephens as "little t*ts" either as part of banter which had gone too far or a nickname which had been initiated but not stuck.'

'There was nothing which might have been misconceived or misinterpreted by Miss Broughton. We think it more likely than not that the claimant’s version is correct.'

He added: 'She’s a relatively quiet-spoken individual whom we believe was pretty upset. The circumstances were serious and caused her to give up her job.'

Miss Broughton was awarded £10,000 for injury to feelings and £529.34 in wages plus interest against Mr Stephens and the Sheffield-based pub company Reet Ale Pubs.
