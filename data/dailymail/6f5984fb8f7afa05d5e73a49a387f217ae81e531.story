Victim: Mark Berney, from Knaresborough, who died of stab wounds in Ripley, North Yorkshire

A man has handed himself in to police after a father was found stabbed to death in a car in a quaint Yorkshire village, police revealed today.

Officers said the emergency services were called to a house in picturesque Whipley Bank, at Ripley, near Harrogate,  on Sunday night.

Outside, they discovered 44-year-old packaging firm worker Mark  Berney, from Knaresborough, suffering from fatal injuries.

A local man, aged 40, was questioned on suspicion of murder after he handed himself in to Greater Manchester Police at 2.40am on Monday.

He remains in custody, North Yorkshire Police confirmed. 

Mr Berney is believed to be a football fan who had a 19-year-old daughter. 

The B6165 road at Whipley Bank was sealed off with police tape and closed to traffic while officers carried out detailed investigations at the scene of the incident.

A white tent could be seen at the scene of the incident as forensic investigations were carried out.

Neighbours say they have just been told that police are investigating a major incident.

'We thought it was a car accident,' said one neighbour. 'It all started just after 9pm last night, with feds everywhere.

'There's a car under the tent, parked half on the road and half on the pavement, a black Peugeot I think. But the police haven't told us anything.' 

The emergency services were alerted and the victim was discovered by officers at 9.30pm on Sunday.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: 'Ambulance and police teams were alerted to an address on Whipley Bank and discovered a man with fatal injuries in a car.'

The spokesman reassured the public saying: 'Police would like to reassure local residents that it was an isolated incident and there was no danger posed to the wider public.
