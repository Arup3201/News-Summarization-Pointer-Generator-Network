Adam Levine made his name as the frontman of Maroon 5, but it seems he may have a successful career in fashion, too.

The 34-year-old launched a collection of men's clothing and accessories for Kmart on October 1, and according to Kmart boss Bernt Ullmann, it's doing incredibly well.

So well, in fact, that Mr Ullmann thinks the singer is destined for great things in the fashion world. He told WWD: 'We couldn't be happier. . . There is nothing on the floor that is not working,' adding: 'I think Adam has the ability to be Kmart's Calvin Klein business.'

Raving review: Kmart boss Bernt Ullmann said Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine, who launched a menswear collection for the retailer on October 1, 'has the ability to be Kmart's Calvin Klein business'

Not only does Mr Levine attract a new type of the customer, but the fact that he is on television every week as a judge on The Voice means that he generates even more recognition, says Mr Ullmann, who is the president of Kmart parent Sears Holdings Corp's Shop Your Way Brands.

'The white space is for that younger, 
upwardly mobile Kmart customer that wants a cleaned-up lifestyle product
that still has a contemporary feel to it,' he explained.

The singer's casual collection 
embodies his own personal style, with flannel shirts, shawl cardigans 
and well-fitted bootcut jeans that range in price from $11 to $30.

The
reason the clothes resonate so much with customers and fans is perhaps 
because Mr Levine made it his mission to play a role in its design.

'If you don't love it and you don't 
endorse it and support it, it just seems like it's another income stream
and not something you are involved with,' he said of celebrity clothing collaborations.

'I think 
sometimes people do it for the paycheck, and there's nothing 
wrong with that. I just prefer to be involved'

sometimes people do phone it in for the paycheck, and there is nothing 
wrong with that. I just prefer to be involved.'

Mr Levine, whose fiancee is Victoria's Secret Angel Behati Prinsloo, said his collection makes his signature style, which can be 'unnecessarily expensive', available to the masses.

'Why not provide an affordable alternative and also have it be something that I love to wear, which is what the line is,' he said.

Dream team: Mr Levine is launching a womenswear line in April with the help of his fiancee, Victoria's Secret Angel Behati Prinsloo, who is expected to 'have a voice in the development'

While he is one of many stars to lend his name to a collaboration with the retailer, including Nicki Minaj and Sofia Vergara, Mr Ullmann believes his has the potential to trump all others thus far.

Success has been so great that he plans to add bags, footwear and jewelry to his collection next spring, as well as a womenswear line in April.

The womens' clothing will undoubtedly be a hit among Mr Levine's mostly female fanbase, and it will also be helped by Miss Prinsloo, who is expected to 'have a voice in the development'.

Bold comparison: Mr Levine's fashion line may be doing very well, but comparing it to that of high fashion designer Calvin Klein (pictured) is something of a stretch
