A surgeon has saved a Gulf War veteran's arm seven hours after it was severed in an industrial accident - using an experimental procedure he'd only heard about on the medical grapevine.

Royce Reid nearly bled to death on the way to hospital in Dallas, Texas, after his forearm was all but ripped off by a conveyor belt at work.

In shock and terrible pain, the 49-year-old at first told doctors to 'just cut it off' and began discussing options for a prosthetic limb.

Lucky to be alive: Royce Reid, who nearly bled to death on his way to hospital in Dallas, shows off the special hand splint supporting his forearm after it was successfully re-attached during experimental surgery

Experimental procedure: Mr Reid's forearm was re-attached in an 18-hour operation which used an external bypass, taking blood from his leg to keep his limb alive

But when he later made a tearful plea for his arm to be saved, specialist hand surgeon Dr Bardia Amirlak decided to try an experimental technique that had never been written about or taught. Nor had he even practised it.

By now, it had been nearly seven hours since the accident, far longer than is normally possible for a re-attachment once its blood supply is cut off.

Dr Amirlak, who is part of the newly created University of Texas Southwestern hand transplant team, said: 'As I was going to make the decision to amputate, he looked at me with tears in his eyes and said: "I have grandkids and I want to hold them with my own hands. Do what you can to save my arm".

'It was worth giving him a shot. He had served our country before — and now we have to help him.'

Almost ripped off: This X-ray reveals the extent of Mr Reid's injuries. His forearm was only attached by a flap of skin when he arrived at hospital

Pioneer: Dr Bardia Amirlak decided to try the rarely-used technique after Mr Reid made a last-minute plea, telling the surgeon he wanted to be able to hold his grandchldren

Dr Amirlak quickly improvised by rigging an 'external bypass' to deliver fresh blood from an artery in Dr Reid's leg directly into the remnant part of the forearm to keep it alive while he worked to first reconnect the bones, then the blood vessels, tendons and nerves.

Dr Amirlak said: 'I knew if I didn’t do this particular technique, Mr Reid would surely lose the arm.'

After 18 hours of surgery, the patient is now using a specialist splint to help with the rehabilitation and has regained some sensation in his arm.

Mr Reid, of Gilmer, 120 miles east of Dallas, said: 'We call them the miracle doctors. They did an amazing job. I'm a lucky guy to be alive.

'I thought that when I went into surgery and came out, I didn't think I would have a hand. I was glad to see one when I came out of surgery!

'Once I get this brace off of it and be able to use it, I plan on holding my grandkids again,' he said.

Success: Dr Amirlak assesses Mr Reid's special outrigger splint. He still faces several surgeries to repair the skin, but doctors say his prognosis is good for a full recovery

It becomes far more difficult to re-attach an arm once three to four hours have passed since the amputation. A finger can survive up to eight hours.

Initially the bone is re-attached, then surgeons generally attempt to reconnect the blood vessels to get blood flowing again. 

After this, the nerves are reconnected. The whole procedure takes many hours, often lasting an entire day.

Generally, patients will regain movement in the re-attached limb.

Getting sensation into the nerves proves more problematic as new nerves need to grow from the old end of the cut nerve.

This can take many months, particularly for older patients. 

Mr Reid, a veteran of Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield, caught his left forearm on a pipe in a conveyor which twisted and mangled it, nearly tearing it off, on August 27.

With his arm held together only by a flap of skin, Mr Reid’s military survival training kicked in. He managed to free himself and even directed several onlookers on how to apply a tourniquet.

He walked to an ambulance that had been called, supporting his own dangling forearm.

Physicians at a hospital in nearby Longview determined that Mr Reid required advanced care and expertise, so he was transferred by helicopter to UT Southwestern's Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas.

Dr Sumeet Teotia, assistant professor of plastic surgery who arrived to provide secondary support for the operation, said: 'Dr Amirlak did something that our entire department had not yet heard about.

'All I can say is that I was there when Dr Amirlak was doing this, and it was amazing. The forearm was completely shattered.'

Mr Reid was discharged after a 10-day hospital stay that included grafting skin from his thigh to his forearm.

Wearing a dynamic outrigger splint that resembles scaffolding to support his healing forearm, Mr Reid now receives occupational therapy and follow-up care at UT Southwestern.

He still faces several surgeries to repair the skin, but doctors say his prognosis is good for a full recovery.
