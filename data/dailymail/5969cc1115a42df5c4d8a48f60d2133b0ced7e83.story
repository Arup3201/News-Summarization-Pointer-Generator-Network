Graeme McDowell has emerged from the Ryder Cup with renewed self-belief and a resolve to re-dedicate himself to the sport after a lost period when he freely admits he was a sports psychologist’s worst nightmare.

It has long been a mystery why someone so good under pressure and on and around the greens should frequently talk himself down. McDowell was at it again at Gleneagles. 

When asked about the possibility of partnering Rory McIlroy, he told an amusing but bewildering story about how he would watch his fellow Northern Irishman drive the ball 350 yards at Medinah in 2012 and ask himself: is it worth me bothering to tee it up?

Well, maybe not if there was nothing else to the game. But thankfully, some good people around him, including caddy Ken Comboy and coach Pete Cowen, have finally got through regarding the qualities McDowell does have rather than those he does not.

‘I have definitely been getting sucked in playing with these big hitters and beating myself up about it,’ revealed G-Mac. ‘Playing with Rory, Stenson, Dustin (Johnson), I’ve been thinking: “Wow, I can’t compete.” 

'Now I am refocusing on what I do have, because I do have the tools to compete. I need to be more like Jim Furyk and stop being obsessed by negatives. My team around me have given me a good dose of reality in telling me how good a player I am.’

Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley did a good job, too, when he gave McDowell the honour of leading the team out in the singles. 

It’s a symptom of how negative McDowell had become that his first thought was to ask himself whether he was up to the task. 

‘It did take me aback at first when he asked me,’ admitted the 35 year old. ‘He said I want you to lead us because you’re a battler and a fighter and I thought: "Oh yeah, I’m a battler and a fighter.” 'I’ d forgotten that about myself. 

'I thought I was just a guy who hit it 275 yards from the tee and could only compete on short courses. I’d forgotten I had a lot of other qualities that made me the player I was. I guess that’s why we pay these fortunes to sports psychologists to get these thoughts out of our heads.

McDowell now knows that while he doesn't have the heavy machinery at the disposal of Rory McIlroy or Dustin Johnson that made him wonder whether he could compete or not, his other virtues make him a threat on tour

‘So I’m using this end of season run to refocus for next year and really commit myself to the game again. I lost focus for the last year for all the right reasons, with getting married and having our first child. They are special times in the life of anyone. 

'But now that’s all stabilised, and I realise how lucky I am to be playing out here. I’m in the prime of my career and I want to give the next five to eight years absolutely everything I have.’

Given his prowess at the format, where better to start than at the Volvo World Match Play Championship at the London Club on Wednesday? 

There were shades of Gleneagles with him out first and up against one of the game’s gifted young talents but, like Jordan Spieth on that earlier occasion Frenchman Alexander Levy was despatched, by a three and two scoreline.

Elsewhere, much of the attention centred around American Patrick Reed, who discovered that not only are the Europeans a tough nut to crack at the Ryder Cup but there’s plenty more who are tough cookies as well. 

Reed was up against Swede Jonas Blixt, who did what no European was able to do at Gleneagles, as he defeated the brash Texan two and one.

Just like the Ryder Cup (above), McDowell was first up in Kent on Wednesday and beat Levy 3&2

Reed will now have to win his next two matches against Paul Casey on Thursday and Jamie Donaldson on Friday if his first visit to the London area is not to end with him spending the weekend as just another American tourist.

As for the man who won the winning point at the Ryder Cup, Donaldson was rather brought down to earth by the only Englishman in the field, as Casey won two and one.

There were also wins for Victor Dubuisson against Pablo Larrazabal, and Shane Lowry over Scot Stephen Gallacher.
