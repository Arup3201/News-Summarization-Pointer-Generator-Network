Gibraltar's first-ever senior competitive game ended in a 7-0 thumping by Poland in their opening Euro 2016 Group D qualifying match on Sunday night.

Robert Lewandowski scored four, Kamil Grosicki fired in two and Lukas Szukala also got onto the scoresheet in a predictably one-sided match at Estadio Do Algarve.

Gibraltar, UEFA's newest member and a country with a population of around 30,000, were accepted by the European governing body in May 2013 following a 14-year battle.

Comfortable: Robert Lewandowski scored a four as Poland cruised to victory over Gibraltar

Opener: Kamil Grosicki scored the opener with the help of a significant deflection 

Struggle: Gibraltar struggled against Poland's superior players, in particular Lewandowski

Performance: Gibraltar worked hard, and the locals were in fine voice, but the hosts were easily outclassed

Fans: Gibraltar fans pose with their tickets outside the stadium before their Euro 16 qualifier

They face a tough test to progress from Group D with a team predominantly made up of amateurs, which has been made even more difficult following their opening result, as they have been drawn with World Cup winners Germany, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Georgia.

Poland took the lead in the 10th minute through Grosicki's low strike to set the tone for the rest of the match.

Gibraltar's Brian Perez tried his luck in the 21st minute but his shot flew over the bar as the home side struggled to make many chances against their experienced opponents.

Bayern Munich striker Lewandowski lined up a free-kick in a dangerous area just to the left of the edge of the 18 yard box but sent it wide. He then fired another attempt into the wall just before the break as Poland held onto their one-goal lead.

Group: Poland's comfortable victory puts them top of Group D on goal difference

Defending: The score could have been worse, were it not for the woodwork and a clearance off the line

New: Gibraltar have never competed in a UEFA  match before as they have only recently been recognised

History: Gibraltar have beaten countries like Malta but Poland is the most populated country they've played

Difficult: Allen Bula faces an uphill battle if his side are to qualify for their first ever European Championships

The visitors doubled their advantage early in the second half when Grosicki was given acres of time and space in the box as Gibraltar's defence stood off and the Rennes midfielder picked his spot.

Lewandowski added the third in the 50th minute when he headed in from close range after a long diagonal ball over to top from Grosicki to stun the home side.

The 26-year-old striker was then denied by keeper Jordan Perez - who works as a fireman - as he stood up and palmed away Lewandowski's effort, but the forward did score his second and Poland's fourth of the match shortly after, when he slid the ball in after a neat one-two with Grosicki on the break.

Szukala then rose highest to head the fifth from a free-kick - meaning Poland had scored four within 10 second-half minutes.

Lewandowski squandered the chance to claim his hat-trick when he could not keep the ball down after trying to fire in from the right in the 80th minute but made no mistake five minutes later as he raced towards goal and coolly beat Jordan Perez.

The prolific forward added his fourth in the first minute of stoppage time to compound Gibraltar's misery in what was a bittersweet arrival in international football.

First: The national anthem is God Save the Queen but Gibraltar sung a different song before kick-off

Competition: Gibraltar have previously competed in the Island Games, finishing runners-up in 1995

International: Gibraltar were on the receiving end of Lewandowski's first international hat-trick

Careers: Gibraltar's national football team includes teachers, fire fighters and civil servants

Qualifiers: Poland have often performed well in qualifiers but disappointed in actual competitions

Group D: The other group members are Germany, Scotland, Georgia and the Republic of Ireland
