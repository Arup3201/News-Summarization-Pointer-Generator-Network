Three generations of a single family were murdered in their house during a stabbing rampage that killed a grandmother, a mother and a 14-year-old boy.

The boy's 9-year-old sister watched at least one of the horrific murders in the home in suburban Nashville, Tennessee. She ran out of the house to get help, though the rest of her family was already dead when she returned.

Police have arrested a neighbor, Craig Garber, who was still at the crime scene when officers arrived.

Back on track: Michelle Pinkowski, who had a history of alcohol abuse, was said to be 'doing well' and trying to take care of her family at the time of her death on Saturday

He answered the door covered in blood and said, 'just kill me.'

The bodies of 48-year-old Michelle Pinkowski; her son, 14-year-old Jonathan Culpepper, and her mother, Marylea Jordan, were discovered around 3am Sunday at the Bellevue home.

Police said the 41-year-old Garber, who had self-inflicted stab wounds, was in stable condition on Sunday at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

Garber lives a few doors down from the family and is known to have 'emotional issues.'

Investigators described the scene inside the home as gruesome.

'The scene is very bloody,' Metropolitan Nashville Police spokesman Don Aaron said. 'It's not something that you see in Nashville.'

Evidence search: When police arrived at the scene, they banged on the door and were greeted by Craig Garber who was dripping in blood, had self-inflicted stab wounds, and said 'just kill me'

Shocking: Police taped up much of the block while collecting evidence, as the suspect lived a few houses away from the victims

Mr Aaron said Garber and Pinkowski were seen together on his porch about 11pm on Saturday. He said the two may have gone to Pinkowski's home, to her finished basement, which is where her body was eventually found.

Police believe Garber then went upstairs and killed the boy in his bedroom and then murdered Jordan. Mr Aaron said the young daughter, who was sleeping on the couch, saw her grandmother get stabbed and fled out a back door to seek help from a neighbor, who called 911.

Police later determined that evidence and blood transfer shows that Garber likely went looking for the little girl not knowing she had escaped.

According to police, the neighbor got a gun and rushed to the girl's home, where he saw Garber walking around inside.

'The way she was screaming and crying 
saying "He's killing her, he's killing her!" I just ran,' the neighbor, 
Jason Zimmerman, told WKRN-TV.

The neighbor said he backed away from the home when he heard sirens.

Mr Aaron said police are trying to get warrants to search the homes of both the victims and the suspect. He said police are also trying to determine the exact nature of the relationship -- if any -- the man has with his neighbors and what the motive could be.

While Ms Pinkowski has a history of 
alcohol abuse and credits a stint at a recovery center for drug-addicted
mothers for her recovery, The Tennessean reports that she twice lost 
custody of her children.

Doing well: Ms Pinkowski worked at Athens Family Diner and had done a shift during the day on Saturday before her murder

'Michelle was really trying to straighten out her life, she'd been in and out of jail. Marylea, the grandmother was a sweet lady who just tried to help take care of her family, and Johnathan was a little boy who was very lost who didn't know family structure,' neighbor Jackie Allison told the paper.

'Craig and his family, he was always there to help me. He was an animal lover, he was always helping Michelle. He had issues, of course, obviously.'

Her sentiments were echoed by police 
who said that even Garber's family admitted to their son's 'emotional 
problems' though no further explanation was given.

Aaron
pretty much ruled out any other suspects saying the police 'firmly 
believe the man responsible for this is known, is in custody and is in 
Vanderbilt'.

Neighbor Josh Kirby last spoke to him the day of the murder, saying that he always got an off-putting feeling when they talked.

'He had crazy eyes. He jumped around to a lot of different subjects while trying to tell me a story and it was very unnerving,' Mr Kirby said.

'My wife, she was very scared of him from the very beginning.'
