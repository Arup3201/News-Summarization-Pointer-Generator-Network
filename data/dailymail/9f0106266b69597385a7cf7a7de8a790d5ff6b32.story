Rihanna: Her record label, Universal Music, was the biggest loser from a YouTube video view crackdown

The world's biggest recording companies have been stripped of two billion YouTube hits after the website cracked down on alleged 'fake' and 'dead' views.

Universal, home of Rihanna, Nicki Minaj and Justin Bieber, lost a total of one billion views in the video site’s biggest ever crackdown on its viewing figures.

Sony was second hardest hit, with the label behind such stars as Alicia Keys, Rita Ora and Labrinth losing more than 850million views in a single day.

The dramatic cuts came as YouTube conducted a crackdown on fake views, but music industry sources have blamed it on housekeeping related to the migration of their videos across different channels.

The unprecedented move left Universal with just five videos on the site - none of which were music - and Sony with just three.

'This was not a bug or a security 
breach. This was an enforcement of our viewcount policy,' YouTube 
announced.

It marks a huge commercial blow to all the artists involved as YouTube is now the web's most important outlet for music videos

Over four billion hours of video are watched by over 
800million unique visitors to the site each month.

The dramatic falls, highlighted by 
figures compiled by YouTube statistics analysts at SocialBlade, came 
after YouTube conducted an audit of its viewing figures aimed at 
combating 'black hat' view count-building techniques.

That is the term used when hackers artificially 
build up the numbers of views or likes on a YouTube video - enabling 
them to make clips appear far more popular than they really are and 
increase their exposure on the site.

The number of views attracted on YouTube
 are these days regarded as an unofficial worldwide popular music chart,
so once it became clear that hits had been inflated, fingers immediately pointed at the record industry.

YouTube viewer figures are doubly valuable to channel owners since it is also the primary way in which the site works out how to share its advertising revenue with partners.

The Daily Dot reported how many of the
 channels affected - which also include ones belonging to Michael 
Jackson, Chris Brown and Beyonce, among others - had also had many 
videos deleted. 

Universal, which previously had dozens of clips on its YouTube channel, has had its offering slashed to just five - none of which are music videos or last more than about a minute and a half.

Sony's page was also left practically bare following the cull, with just three videos left.

The mass takedowns came the same day 
that hundreds of the site's users flooded forums to complain they had 
suffered a series of video deletions for violations of YouTube's terms 
of service. 

Many speculated they fallen victim to a
 technical error, but YouTube replied to confirm that the users had been
 sanctioned for violating TOS item 4, Section H, which bans artificially
 inflating view counts.

According to the Daily Dot, the 
apparent crackdown last week was widely discussed on the Black Hat World
 forum, where visitors exchange advice on unethical search engine 
optimisation tactics.

In one thread  on the forum, where YouTube included a link to the site's policy on
 'viewcount gaming, the first post spoke of
 a 'friend' who 'sells likes' who had been told by four different 
customers that their videos were deleted due to violations of YouTube's 
terms of service.

Record labels have blamed the cuts in their viewing figures on a change in the way that YouTube has changed its view count.

Billboard reported how the Google-owned company recently decided to remove view counts for so-called 'dead videos', which were no longer live on the channel.

A senior label executive told the music industry trade magazine that since thousands of videos had in fact been migrated to Vevo, the views those clips accrued during their time on their dedicated label channels were taken away in YouTube's 'clean up'.

Universal acknowledged its drop in 
views, but told the Daily Dot its channel had been mostly dormant since 
it shifted its focus to Vevo, which it founded in 2009 together with 
Sony Music, Abu Dhabi Media Company, and E1 Entertainment.

Google declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.

Commenters on the Sony YouTube channel gloated over the major record labels' apparent comeuppance.
