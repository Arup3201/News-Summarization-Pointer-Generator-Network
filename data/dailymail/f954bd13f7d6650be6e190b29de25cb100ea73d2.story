Clare Wood, 36, who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2009. A new law giving people the right to know if a partner has a history of violence will be rolled out from today

A scheme giving people the 'right to know' if a partner has a history of domestic violence will be rolled out to police forces across England and Wales from today.

Clare's Law was created following a campaign by Michael Brown, whose daughter was murdered by her ex-boyfriend.

The initiative, officially called the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, is designed to provide people with information that may protect them from a potentially abusive situation.

Following a request, the scheme allows the police to disclose information about a partner's previous history of domestic violence or violent acts.

Clare Wood, 36, was strangled and set on fire by her ex-boyfriend George Appleton at her home in Salford, Greater Manchester, in February 2009.

The mother-of-one had met Appleton on Facebook, unaware of his horrific history of violence against women, including repeated harassment, threats and the kidnapping at knifepoint of one of his ex-girlfriends.

Today's national roll-out has been chosen by Home Secretary Theresa May to coincide with International Women's Day and follows a 14-month pilot scheme in four police force areas, which provided more than 100 people with potentially life-saving information.

Today also marks the national launch of Domestic Violence Protection Orders (DVPOs). This new power will enable police and magistrates' courts to provide protection to people in the immediate aftermath of a domestic violence incident.

Mrs May said: 'Domestic abuse shatters lives and this government is working hard to provide police and local authorities with the tools they need to keep women and girls safe.

'Clare's Law and DVPOs are just two of a raft of measures we have introduced to hand control back to the victim by ensuring they can make informed decisions about their relationship and escape if necessary.

'Protection for victims is improving but sadly there are still too many cases where vulnerable people are let down.

'I am determined to see a society where violence against women and girls is not tolerated, where people speak out, and where no woman or girl has to suffer domestic abuse.'

DVPOs can be used to provide immediate protection to a victim where there is not enough evidence to charge an alleged perpetrator and provide protection to victims via bail conditions.

They can last for up to 28 days, during which time the perpetrator can be prevented from having contact with the victim, giving them the opportunity to make decisions about their future safety with the help of a support agency.

Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: 'Domestic violence is illegal and this coalition government has made significant progress in tackling abuse in all its forms.

Clare's Law was created following a campaign by Clare's father Michael Brown (second left). The initiative, officially called the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, is designed to provide people with information that may protect them from abuse

'Last year we extended the definition of domestic violence to include controlling and coercive behaviour and in December re-launched the This Is Abuse campaign to highlight to young people that it's not just physical violence that makes a relationship abusive.

'We have also ring-fenced nearly £40 million of funding for specialist local support services and national helplines to help people escape abusive situations.'

The implementation of Clare's Law and DVPOs form an integral part of the Government's Call To End Violence Against Women And Girls' Action Plan 2014.

The plan includes a commitment to put in place a new code of practice to ensure that safe addresses of victims of domestic and sexual abuse are protected.

This will take effect where victims might otherwise have to reveal details of their address to people who could threaten them - for example in court cases unrelated to their abuse, or when required for their children's school records, or the family's access to benefits.

Clare's Law was trialled in Greater Manchester, Gwent, Wiltshire and Nottingham from September 2012.

Clare's Law was created after 36-year-old Clare Wood was murdered by a man who became known as the 'Facebook fugitive'.

In the days after her brutal killing, detectives issued a warning that her ex-boyfriend George Appleton might attempt to communicate with other women via the internet.

Unbeknown to Miss Wood, Appleton had a history of violence towards women and was known to prowl online dating websites and Facebook in search of partners, often using different aliases.

The mother-of-one's body was discovered in the bedroom of her home in Salford, Greater Manchester, in February 2009. She had been strangled and set on fire.

Police watchdogs concluded afterwards that she had been badly let down by 'individual and systemic' failures by Greater Manchester Police (GMP).

In the months before her murder she had repeatedly contacted GMP alleging Appleton had caused criminal damage, harassed her, threatened to kill her and tried to rape her.

Appleton, from Salford, was found six days later after her death, hanged in a derelict pub.

Clare's father, Michael Wood, who has backed the campaign, later said he had taken an 'instant' dislike to Appleton.

Miss Wood had told her father Appleton had a criminal record - though only for motoring offences.In fact he had been jailed for three years in 2002 for harassing another woman and for six months a year earlier after breaching a restraining order on another ex-girlfriend.

At the inquest into Miss Wood's death in May 2011, Coroner Jennifer Leeming said women in abusive relationships should have the right to know about the violent past of the men they were with, just as Sarah's Law recommends parents have the right to know of any child sex convictions of men with access to their children.

Ms Leeming recorded a verdict of unlawful killing by strangulation as the cause of Miss Wood's death before making a number of recommendations to be passed on to police and the Government.

The family's campaign was also taken up by Salford and Eccles MP Hazel Blears and backed by police and Home Secretary Theresa May, who agreed to run the pilot.

Mr Brown, a former prison officer from Batley, West Yorkshire, said at the start of it: 'My daughter wasn't stupid. Had she known about George Appleton's past she would have taken herself and my granddaughter out of there in a heartbeat.'

Following an article on March 8 about ‘Clare’s Law’,which allows police to disclose information about a partner’s previous convictions for domestic abuse, we are happy to clarify that the scheme applies to men as well as women.
