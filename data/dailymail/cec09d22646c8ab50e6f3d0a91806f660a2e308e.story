A city’s first openly gay councillor has been been accused of keeping a ‘gimp’ sex slave.

Labour member Stephen Poulson allegedly took aim at Liberal Cllr Stephen Radford, who represents Tuebrook in Liverpool, and made the bizarre remarks on Facebook.

A string of comments are said to have been posted in a group called Tuebrook Uncovered apparently by Poulson accusing Radford, 57, of having a masked, leather-clad sex slave.

It said: 'Was not on to the fact we had a fancy dress yesterday. Cllr Radford and his candidate (the gimp from the cellar) came dressed as tramps and ate all our butties like they had been living in the bus stop.'

Liberal leader Radford, who became Liverpool’s first openly gay councillor, claims Poulson has been abusing him and his other party members for two years.

The politician branded Poulson an ‘abusive troll’ and claimed he was forced to contact a solicitor to have the comments removed from the closed group Facebook page.

Councillor Radford said: 'His comments have been blatantly abusive and purely out of malice, there’s no two ways about that.

Abuse: The offensive comments posted by Stephen Poulson

'He posted a string of attacks on the Tuebrook Uncovered Facebook page which we asked to be removed.

'It wasn’t until we contacted solicitors that comments were eventually removed which shows a level of complete shallowness.

'The comment about the gimp in the cellar was clearly a sexual comment. He’s just an abusive troll who thinks he can say anything he wants on the internet - he’s totally gutless.

'When we did complain he responded by saying it was an attack on his freedom of speech which is completely ludicrous.'

Cllr Radford vented his frustration at the length of time it took Labour to address his complaints about Poulson.

He said: 'It’s not like he’s just made a schoolboy comment on the playground. This has been going on for two years and he’s still out there dishing out leaflets.

'How can any responsible political party have someone behaving like this for such a long period of time without doing anything about it?

'I’m appalled it has been able to go on for such a long time without being dealt with.'

Tuebrook is a ward in the West Derby Parliamentary constituency held by Labour MP Stephen Twigg, the first openly gay man at the time of his election to the House of Commons in the 1997 general election.

A spokesperson for the Labour Party in Liverpool said Poulson had been spoken to about the comments, which did not form any of the party’s political campaigning.

The spokesperson said: 'Stephen Twigg has a long-established track record of clean campaigning and is about taking a positive approach to politics.

'It’s true we are concerned about the reports we have received and are trying to take steps to deal with it.

'We have a duty of care to each individual member but equally we have a long-standing and positive relationship with Steve Radford.

'He is an active local councillor in the constituency and it’s a relationship that has been built on respect.

'While we are enthusiastic to take the Labour message to Tuebrook, where Stephen Twigg is MP, it’s a positive message, not personally critical of Cllr Radford and his team and this is not the sort of campaigning that Stephen Twigg or the West Derby CLP are engaged in, or ever will be.'

Poulson has admitted comments about Radford having a ‘sexual bias’ towards Scouts in his capacity as chair of poverty charity Tuebrook Hope Group, on Facebook.

He posted a retraction saying they were 'untrue and unfounded'.

An earlier version of this article said that Stephen Poulson had accused Stephen Radford of soliciting sex from boy scouts. We have since been informed that this was not the case and regret any distress caused.
