She was the famous beauty who captured the heart of one of the UK's best-loved artists but unlike her contemporary, Lizzie Siddal, few remember Jane Burden today.

And yet, the story of Jane Burden, later Morris, the beautiful stablehand's daughter who went on to appear in some of the world's most famous paintings, is just as fascinating.

Now the tale of the model and muse, who died exactly 100 years ago, is the subject of an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, due to run until May.

Muse: Jane proved irresistible to the Pre-Raphaelite painters, including Rossetti who painted this 1881 portrait

Janey Morris: A Pre-Raphaelite Muse charts her rags-to-riches journey and includes some of the incredible works of art she appeared in.

Many were by her lover, husband William Morris' close friend Dante Gabriel Rossetti, whose other muse was his wife, the flame-haired Lizzie Siddal.

Although Morris didn't share Siddal's tawny colouring, she did match her for beauty and frequently appeared as a goddess, whether Proserpine [Persephone] or Astarte, in Rossetti's work.

Her husband, meanwhile, chose to portray her as King Arthur's famously beautiful - and famously unfaithful - Queen Guinevere in an 1858 painting that also goes by the title La Belle Iseult.

Other artists to work with Morris included Edward Burne-Jones, who immortalised her likeness in a succession of stained glass windows, and Evelyn de Morgan; one of the few female Pre-Raphaelite painters.

The Pre-Raphelites were a group of English artists who formed a 'brotherhood' in 1848, dedicated to creating work that rejected the mannered approach adopted by Raphael and other Renaissance painters.

Believing Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo had proven a corrupting influence on art, they wanted to return to the intense colour and detailed compositions that characterised 15th century Italian art.

Founded by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, the trio later welcomed Rossetti's brother, William, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to their circle.

So who was Jane Morris? Like Siddal, her rival in both love and art, little is known of her childhood other than that it was poor and deprived.

Born on the 19th October 1839 in Oxford, Morris was the daughter of a stableman, Robert Burden, and his laundress wife Ann Maizey.

Although she was undoubtedly beautiful, she seemed destined for a life of obscurity until a chance encounter with a group of artists outside a theatre at the age of 18 changed her life forever.

Edward Burne-Jones and Gabriel Dante Rossetti were in Oxford to complete work on a mural for John Ruskin, then the UK's leading art critic and the Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford University.

Spotting her outside Oxford's Drury theatre, the pair were enraptured by her beauty and Morris' modelling career began.

Morris, for her part, was smitten by Rossetti but he, at the time engaged to Lizzie Siddal, didn't reciprocate.

Instead, she became engaged to his friend, William Morris, whom she met through Rossetti and sat for on several occasions.

The pair married in 1859 and went on to have two daughters, Jane and Mary, with whom they lived in the beautiful Kelmscott Manor on the Gloucestershire-Oxfordshire border.

Despite her humble background, the new Mrs Morris had few problems fitting into upper class society, refining her accent to the point where friends described it as 'queenly' and later inspiring Vernon Lee's 1884 novel Miss Brown, which in turn inspired the musical and film, My Fair Lady.

But although she and Morris appear to have been happy, Rossetti remained in the background and after Siddal's death, their affair began in earnest.

The relationship would last, off and on, until his death in 1882, and she would go on to star in some of his most famous works.

After his death, she embarked on an affair with poet and political activist Wilfred Scawen Blunt that endured until 1894.

He was her last love. Just two years after her relationship with Blunt ended, her husband died and Jane, left white-haired by the trauma of nursing him through his final illness, would remain alone for the rest of her life.

She would outlive her husband by 16 years, eventually dying peacefully at the age of 75 in her bed on 26th January 1914 in Bath.

Muse, model and romantic, Jane's death might have been a conventional one but her life was anything but.
