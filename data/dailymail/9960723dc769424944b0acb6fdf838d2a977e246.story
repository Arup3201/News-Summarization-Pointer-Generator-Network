Call it airplane-bnb - a retired jetliner that flew around the world nearly 4,000 times has been converted into the hotel of aviation enthusiasts' dreams.

A one-night stay on board the 'pimped out' plane is on offer for three lucky people in a competition run by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Airbnb.

The lucky guests will get to run free in 4,000-square foot space decked out with a master bedroom, seven bathrooms, a private cinema, two fully-equipped kitchens and a play area for children.

The aeroplane stay will suit the nervous flyer as it won't leave the ground at Amsterdam's airport

After crossing the world 3,675 times the KLM airplane will serve as a pop-up hotel for three nights only - between November 28 and 30 - as it is transformed into one of Airbnb's most spectacular listings.

Nervous flyers are welcome, as the night will be a relaxing one spent on the ground.

Located at Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam's main air traffic hub, KLM promises the guests a night they won't forget, and probably one of the most enjoyable sleeps they've ever had aboard an aeroplane.

Three lucky winners will be selected to spend one night in the plane in late November

There are two bedrooms, seven bathrooms and two kitchens on board the converted plane

It will certainly be bright and airy inside with 116 windows on board and lots of room to relax

Even Heggernes, Airbnb's manager for the Netherlands, said: 'Airbnb is all about offering unique travel experiences and the KLM plane fits that perfectly.

'KLM has really gone to town in creating the ultimate airplane listing. 

'This will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any plane enthusiast.'

Why not relax the night away with a good book on board your aeroplane hotel?

Airbnb offers more than 800,000 listings worldwide - and a few of them are converted aeroplanes.

Another unique initiative is 'Night at', which unlocks places  where it's never before been possible to stay. So far, this has included an IKEA store in Australia, Chateau de Chenonceau in France, and a Waterstones bookstore in the UK.

For the stay on the converted plane in Amsterdam, KLM will fly in the lucky few from anywhere in the world.
