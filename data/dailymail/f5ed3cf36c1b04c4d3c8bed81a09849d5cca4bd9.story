A second black Barneys customer has claimed store clerks racially profiled her after she bought a designer bag - and police officers pounced on her, demanding to know how she could afford it.

Kayla Phillips, 21, said she was stunned when she heard of the case of Trayon Christian, a black 19-year-old student, who was held by police after buying a $350 designer belt from the store.

The young mother, from Brooklyn, New York, said she experienced similarly shocking treatment from staff at the Madison Avenue store in February when she bought a $2,500 Céline handbag.

She has now filed a $5 million notice of claim with the city showing her intention to sue the NYPD.

Complaint: Kayla Phillips, 21, says cops demanded to know how she could afford to buy a $2,500 Céline bag from Barneys in New York - in a case that echoes that of a teen accusing the store of racial profiling

'As I was walking into the train station, four undercover police officers attacked me,' Phillips told the New York Post.

'They were very rough,' she added to the New York Daily News. 'I didn't know what was happening.'

She explained to the cops that she had used a temporary Bank of America card to make the purchase - and they demanded to know why her name was not on it.

She called her mother, Wendy Straker, who said that the police officers had asked her daughter: 'What are you doing here in Manhattan? Where'd you get the money to buy that expensive bag?'

Straker added that the police were on the phone with a Barneys employee about the transaction.

Police finally let her go after she showed them her ID and new debit card, which arrived that morning.

Treat: She had just bought a $2,500 orange suede Céline handbag when she was stopped by cops

'Jay Z is getting ready to do a 
campaign with Barneys, but they’re looking at these African-American 
kids like they're thieves,' Straker said.

The case comes after it emerged that another shopper, Trayon Christian, was stopped and handcuffed after he bought a $350 Salvatore Ferragamo belt in the store.

Christian, 19, has now filed a lawsuit for unspecified damages against the Madison Avenue store and the NYPD who wrongly accused him of fraud.

Mr Christian, who lives with his mom in Queens, had decided to splash out on the belt after seeing one of his favorite music stars, Harlem rapper Juelz Santana, wearing the accessory.

However once he had paid for the belt 
and had left Barneys on April 29 this year, the fashion-loving teen was 
grabbed by undercover officers on the street.

According to the civil rights lawsuit, the 19-year-old was asked 'how a young black man such as himself could afford to purchase such an expensive belt'. 

Trayon Christian, 19, has brought a lawsuit against Barneys and the NYPD after they wrongly accused him of fraud when he purchased a designer belt

Barneys department store is facing a lawsuit after a 19-year-old black student claims he was wrongly grabbed by store detectives because of his color and accused of stealing a designer belt

Mr Christian's lawyer Michael Palillo told the New York Daily News: 'He's never been arrested. His only crime was being a young black guy buying a $300 belt.'

A
Barneys store employee had asked the 19-year-old for ID when he used 
his Chase debit card to buy the belt. Mr Christian showed the clerk his 
state ID.

The store cashier then subsequently called the police to claim that the purchase was a fraud, according to the lawsuit.

Officers took the teenager to a local precinct.

Mr Christian once again showed his ID, debit card and receipt for the belt. Officers still refused to believe the teenager.

Finally Chase bank was contacted who verified that the debit card belonged to Mr Christian. It was only then that he was allowed to go after spending two hours in a holding cell, the suit claims. 

The NYPD denied this and said the student was only held for 42 minutes.

The student, who has no history of arrests, said that he will never shop at Barneys again following the incident.

A Barney's New York spokesman said: 'Barneys New York typically does not comment on pending litigation. 

'In this instance, we feel compelled to note that after carefully reviewing the incident of last April, it is clear that no employee of Barneys New York was involved in the pursuit of any action with the individual other than the sale. 

'Barneys New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination and we stand by our long history in support of all human rights.'
