As New Year’s resolutions fall by the wayside, sometimes technology is needed to keep people from dipping their hand in the cookie jar.

And one British start-up thinks Sammy Screamer could help.

Sammy Screamer is a ‘cute little movement sensor’ that can be attached to objects, such as a cookie jar and beeps at people who try to move or open them – as well as alerting the owner to the invasion.

 sensor’ that can be attached to objects, such as a cookie jar (left) or fridge (right) that  beeps or 'screams'
 at people who try to move or open them

The triangular movement sensor has a shocked facial expression and will be controlled by a smartphone app when it is launched in August.

It is designed as a device for parents, but will be able to be used by anyone to keep an eye on any object – including fridges and jars to keep dieters on the straight and narrow.

The person in control of Sammy Screamer will be able to choose how loud they want her to beep and how sensitive to movement they want her to be, by using a free smartphone app.

They will then be able to attach her to the object they want to guard - from a fridge to a bag, or a room that is out of bounds - using the device’s concealed magnet or cord to attach it.

The sensor has a Bluetooth unit, accelerometer, a battery and speaker inside.

When the device is moved it will beep and will send a push notification to its owner’s smartphone.

Tom Evans, founder of Bleep Bleeps, the company behind Sammy Screamer, said the device can be used to keep bags safe, or can be fixed to a pushchair or bike to let people know if it is moved.

He believes there is a shortage of products for ‘cool, tech-savvy parents’ and has designed a whole range of instruments to help with parenting, from ear thermometers and Lily Loco – a GPS tracker for children – to tools to help people become pregnant.

They are like ‘Japanese characters meet building blocks,’ he said.

Sammy Screamer is Bleep Bleep’s launch product and the small London-based team is currently raising money to put it into production on crowd funding website Kickstarter.

The device is available to pre-order for $60 (£37) and a pack of three is on offer for $150 (£92).
