Lord Justice Moses chided David Cameron for not knowing what Magna Carta meant

A senior judge has delivered the most damning verdict yet  on the Government’s plans to deliver ‘justice on the cheap’ by letting giant companies bid for legal aid contracts.

Lord Justice Moses mockingly suggested that following controversial reforms to how law firms work, members of the judiciary should compete to produce the most judgments in the shortest time – and receive sponsorship from L’Oréal, Silk Cut or Virgin to help save the Treasury money.

In an after-dinner speech to  the London Criminal Courts Solicitors’ Association last week, the Appeal Court judge, 67, described proposals by Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling as a ‘joke’ and chided David Cameron for not knowing what Magna Carta meant.

He warned that plans to take legal aid cases away from hundreds of high street firms and hand them to companies such as haulier Eddie Stobart would create ‘a desert’ where choice would be meaningless.

‘What use is choice when you have nothing to choose save Eddie Stobarts? What is the point of asking a man to choose still or sparkling water when you have left him to crawl in the desert?’ he said.

‘If lawyers are not to provide services of a quality above a level specified by the state, why should judges?’

Lord Justice Moses joked it was ‘financially wasteful’ to have lots of independent judges so they should ‘amalgamate’ and gain sponsors to cut costs.

The comments are the most withering attack so far on legal aid reforms by a serving member of the judiciary.

Solicitors and barristers have led the charge against Mr Grayling’s Price Competitive Tendering plans, which would put dozens of small firms out of business by carving up legal aid contracts for criminal cases among a handful of corporations.
