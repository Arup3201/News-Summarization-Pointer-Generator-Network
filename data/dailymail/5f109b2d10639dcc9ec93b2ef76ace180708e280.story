Jordan Henderson's father Brian has revealed that he kept his battle with cancer a secret to avoid it affecting the Liverpool midfielder's performance on the pitch.

Brian Henderson was diagnosed with the illness last November, but didn't reveal the news to his son until earlier this year, just before he had surgery on his tongue and throat.

Brian is now on the road to recovery after having his cancer removed, and he told his son Jordan to make him proud with his performances for Liverpool.

Secret: Brian Henderson did not reveal his cancer battle to son Jordan to avoid it affecting his performances

Praise: Brian also informed Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers of his illness and said the club were 'amazing'

Energetic: Henderson helped Liverpool to second

The 59-year-old retired police officer, who is due to speak at a Sunderland conference for cancer survivors about his experience, also informed Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers about his illness.

He said: 'It was a very emotional time when I had to break the news to the family.

'I went to speak to Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool who was very understanding. He gave Jordan time off, and the people at Liverpool were amazing.

'They were very understanding and gave him a lot of support.

'I said to Jordan that the best thing he could do for me when he got back to playing was try to get man of the match in every game.

'People didn't realise the pressure he was under. I was so proud of him.'

Henderson's energetic performances helped Liverpool to within two points of their Premier League title last season.

The 24-year-old earned a place in Roy Hodgson's England World Cup squad, but his dad Brian was unable to travel to see him play due to his illness.
