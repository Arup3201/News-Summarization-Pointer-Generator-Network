Mrs Revell worked part-time at Katharine House Hospice in Stafford, and had been due to  answer questions about the referral of a patient

The allegation was said to be 'of a minor nature' and not one which could lead to her dismissal, the hearing at Cannock Coroner's Court was told.

The inquest heard how Mrs Revell's husband Paul, 57, had returned to the couple's £270,000 home in Stafford after work where he found his wife's body in the hot tub. She was fully clothed except for her shoes.

Earlier in the day, the mother-of-two and school governor had written a suicide note which she had put in a Christmas card and left in the kitchen.

She had also sent a text message to her daughter Hannah, telling her to go to a neighbour's house after school.

Before her death, Mrs Revell had sent a text to her daughter Hannah telling her to go to a neighbour's house, instead of the family home (pictured) 

'When Hannah and the neighbour arrived at the house at around 5pm they found the front door unlocked and Mrs Revell's car in the drive,' Detective Constable Mark Bailey told the hearing.

'Mr Revell arrived home from work soon after and searched the garden before finding his wife's body in the hot tub.

'A farewell message was later found inside a Christmas card in the kitchen.'

A post mortem examination revealed that she had drowned, and there was no trace of alcohol or drugs in her body.

The inquest heard she was in good health and had no history of mental health problems.

South Staffordshire Coroner Andy Haigh concluded Mrs Revell had committed suicide 'while stressed.'

He said: 'She was a lady who was committed to her family, her community and her career.

'She did have some recent problems at work.

'These appear to have been of a minor nature, but with the benefit of hindsight they were not minor matters for Jane and are a major reason for her death.

'I fully accept that no-one in the family expected Jane to have done this, and I am very sorry that she should have done.'

Speaking after the inquest, Dr Richard Soulsby, chief executive of Katharine House Hospice, paid tribute to Mrs Revell.

'Jane's contribution to the hospice over the last 12 years has been immeasurable and her death has been a huge shock to her friends, colleagues, and patients,' he said.

'She was a vibrant and greatly valued member of our team.'
