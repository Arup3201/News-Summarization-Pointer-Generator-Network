Lazy: Two thirds of Brits are putting themselves at risk of heart disease and strokes by not doing the recommended daily amount of exercise

Two thirds of Britons are putting their health at risk by doing less than the recommended amount of exercise.

The World Heart Federation says 67 per cent fail to achieve the suggested 30 minutes a day of brisk walking, while 29 per cent do less than nine minutes a day, putting themselves at risk of premature death.

It warns that inactivity increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.

A study by the group ahead of World Heart Day on Sunday suggests Britain is among the least active countries.

In contrast, 48 per cent of people in Spain walk briskly for more than 30 minutes a day, while 54 per cent of Brazilians and Indians do the recommended amount.

Meanwhile, the least active part of Britain is the Midlands, with 74 per cent not doing enough and a staggering 35 per cent walking for less than nine minutes per day.

Scots are the most active - 39 per cent do the recommended amount of exercise and one in six do more than an hour a day.

The study found one in three Brits questioned had no idea how much time they spend walking.

The World Heart Federation is now urging people to increase their physical activity to protect their health.

Chief science officer Dr Kathryn Taubert said: 'Awareness is the first step to a healthy heart. Paying attention to how much we walk should be as simple as watching what we eat.

'On World Heart Day, we are urging people to take action to protect their hearts.

'By reaching the recommended minimum 30 
minutes of  moderate exercise, which includes brisk walking, at least 
five days a week, many premature deaths can be prevented.’

The World Heart Federation recommends 30 minutes of brisk walking a day. Spain, India and Brazil are all ahead of Britain in the exercise stakes

The study also found men are the lazier sex, with 72 per cent doing less than the required 30 minutes of ‘brisk walking’ five days a week, compared to 63 per cent of women.

Having children may encourage us to get out and walk more, as 37 per cent of those with young kids do at least 30 minutes of exercise each day, compared to just 32 per cent without.

The World Heart Federation and healthcare group Bupa are launching a free walking app in a bid to encourage people to get moving.
