Stacey Perkins outside Trafford Magistrates' Court where she pleaded guilty to common assault

A feuding mother started a catfight with another mum in a school playground over the death of a 17-year-old in a car crash. 

Blonde Stacey Perkins, 23, 'ambushed' 24-year-old Jemma Collis as she waited to pick up her son at Partington Primary School, near Manchester.

The assault took place last September after Miss Collis began dating Nathan Rowe, who was jailed in 2005 for killing Perkins' cousin 
Robert Morris in a car crash.

The then 19-year-old had driven at speeds of up to 70mph before losing control at the entrance to Dunham Massey Park, near Altrincham, and hitting a tree.

Robert, who was with him at the time, was trapped in the burning car and died at the scene.

Rowe admitted causing death by dangerous driving, driving without a licence and insurance and failing to stop after an accident.

He was sentenced to eight 
and a half years in prison but was released after four.

Trafford Magistrates' Court heard yesterday how the two women, 
whose children go to different schools, had a series of 'altercations' 
which led to Perkins vowing to 'verbally have it out' with Miss Collis 
during school pick up time.

Perkins was said to have yanked Miss Collis' hair back, and yelled: 'You think you are going to smash my face in?'

As other parents and pupils looked on in horror, Perkins pulled Miss Collis to the floor, punched her about the head and then stamped on her chest.

The victim was only able to escape when the head teacher emerged from her study and pulled Perkins off, ordering her from the school yard.

At the court in Sale, Greater Manchester, Perkins sobbed as she apologised for her conduct, saying: 'I'm really sorry for doing what I did and the fact it was in a school.'

She pleaded guilty to common assault.

Prosecutor Eileen Rogers said Miss Collis had walked through the school gates with Mr Rowe, 26, and they were in the playground waiting to collect her six-year-old son.

She added: 'Jemma immediately recognised a voice as that of Stacey Perkins saying "you think you are going to smash my face in?"

'A hand grabbed the back of Jemma's long hair and she looked up and saw Stacey Perkins. She started to punch her.'

The court heard how Miss Collis tried to release herself from her petite attacker's grip but was continually being hit as Mr Rowe tried to separate them.

'Stacey used her foot and stamped on Jemma's chest,' Miss Rogers said.

'She was unable to stand up due to the continued punching to her body.'

In a victim impact statement, Miss Collis said: 'I heard a booming voice I immediately recognised as Stacey and felt a hard ram to the back of me.

'The force was such that my head was forced forward and I hit the ground. I looked up and saw Stacey.

Incident: Partington Primary School - the scene of the playground attack

'I was shocked and terrified. She was holding me down I was really struggling to escape because I was being continually punched to the head and body.

"I managed to get to my feet but I was still being held down by her. After around 60 seconds it stopped.'

During the attack, Miss Collis sustained a two-inch scratch to her forehead and grazes to her knees, elbow and chest and Mr Rowe suffered a bruise to the back of his head.

She added: 'I have been left feeling very sore, aching and I have visual injuries which I don't know how to explain to my son.

'I have been left emotionally upset at the fact it took place in a school playground. It was a total shock and unprovoked and I have been left in fear that it will happen again.'

Tragic: Robert Morris died aged 17

After the catfight Perkins wrote a letter to the school's head teacher apologising for her behaviour.

She also printed 50 letters and asked that they be distributed to the school's parents.

Perkins, from Partington, was ordered to complete a 12-month community order and 100 hours of unpaid work after she admitted common assault.

Defending her, lawyer Paul 
Shepherd said that his client had pleaded guilty and had co-operated 
with the police.

He
said: 'It does sound horrific and the Crown make out that Miss Collis 
was an innocent party but there are always two sides to a story.

'Eight
years ago, Nathan Rowe was convicted of death by dangerous driving, the 
victim was Stacey Perkins’ cousin. The Perkins’ family have put this 
issue behind them.

'Since 
this has happened he has started a relationship with a woman, Jemma. She
has been feeding information to him that the family have animosity 
towards him.’

He added on 
the day in question, Perkins had bumped into Miss Collis and Mr Rowe during 
school drop off time and they began 'making gestures to her'.

'That
was the final straw for Miss Perkins, she dropped her son off at home 
and went to the school with the intention to only verbally have it out 
with her,' he said.

'She
accepts full responsibility and that she grabbed her hair and as she 
has done that they both fell to the floor and it has gone on for 60 
seconds. It was "tit for tat" it wasn't that Miss Perkins had the 
advantage.'

Passing 
sentence, magistrates chairman June Nelson said the fact there 
were children present at the time made the incident more serious.

'There
is a history of conflict between you and the victim. We have heard 
about your remorse and writing of letters - you are obviously sorry,' 
she added.

Two other women were arrested in connection with the incident, but were released without charge.

At
the time of the incident, neighbourhood Inspector Bryan Hepburn 
referring to Perkins said: 'These people have no sense of decorum at 
all.

'They have carried out a dispute in front of children at school. It shows the mentality of the people involved here.

'They
have disregard for the school, the education authority and the children
who had to see such a thing, and lots of kids will have seen what 
happened and will have been frightened to see it.'
