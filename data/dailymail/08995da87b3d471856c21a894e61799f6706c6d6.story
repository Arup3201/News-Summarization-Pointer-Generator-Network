Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can still be tried in Massachusetts, a US appeals court ruled on Friday as it dismissed his lawyers' requests to move the case elsewhere.

Tsarnaev, then aged 19, is accused of planting two bombs near the marathon finish line in April 2013 with the help of his brother, Tamerlan. The attacks killed three people and injured more than 260.

His lawyers had urged the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to move the high-profile trial out of Boston, claiming prospective jurors from the area had already made up their minds about his guilt.

They had argued the intense media coverage of the case and the high number of people affected by the terror attacks made it impossible for Tsarnaev to find a fair and impartial jury in Massachusetts.

But in a 2-1 ruling on Friday, a three-judge panel found that the defense did not meet the standards necessary to have the trial - which features 12 jurors and six alternates - moved out of the region.

Chief Judge Sandra Lynch and Judge Jeffrey Howard said any high-profile case would receive high media attention, but that knowledge of such case 'does not equate to disqualifying prejudice'.

'Distinguishing between the two is at the heart of the jury selection process,' they wrote.

The panel's ruling followed prosecutors' claims that Judge George O'Toole Jr's questioning of prospective jurors had successfully weeded out people with strong opinions on Tsarnaev's guilt.

It was not immediately evident whether Tsarnaev's defense team could ask the federal appeals court to review the request again before a full panel of six judges, in what is deemed an 'en banc' review.

On Friday, Judge Lynch and Judge Howard said it was not clear and indisputable that the publicity surrounding the former University of Massachusetts student's case required a change of venue.

Defense: They had argued that the high number of people affected by the terror attacks made it impossible for Tsarnaev to find a fair and impartial jury in Massachusetts.

They added that the ongoing jury selection process did not suggest pervasive prejudice, nor did the defense team demonstrate irreparable harm if the trial was not moved out of Massachusetts.

The judges noted that other high-profile terrorism cases such as the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the prosecution of Zacarias Moussaoui - the man who became known as the '20th hijacker' from the September 11 attacks - occurred in the district where the crimes occurred.

But in a dissent, Judge Juan Torruella voiced his support for moving the trial, writing: 'If a change of venue is not required in a case like this, I cannot imagine a case where it would be.

He added: 'If residents of the Eastern Division of the District of Massachusetts did not already resent Tsarnaev and predetermine his guilt, the constant reporting on the Marathon bombing and its aftermath could only further convince the prospective jurors of his guilt.'

A spokesman for the US attorney's office declined to comment on the ruling on Friday. A defense attorney did not immediately respond to an email from the Associated Press seeking comment.

Lawyers for Tsarnaev, now aged 21, had asked O'Toole three times to move the trial.

Each time, he had refused, saying bias among prospective jurors could be rooted out through carefult questioning about their thoughts on Tsarnaev and the death penalty. 

The same jury that will decide on Tsarnaev's guilt will also decide whether he lives or dies.

If he is convicted, the only possible punishments are life in prison without parole or the death penalty. Only jurors who said they will give meaningful consideration to both can be seated on the jury.

Dead: Tsarnaev's brother, Tamerlan (pictured, left, and, right, on the day of the high-profile bombing), is also suspected of being responsible for the fatal twin attacks. He died in a shootout with police after the bombing

Earlier this year, federal public defender Judith Mizner told the appeals court that the local jury pool is 'connected to the case in many ways' and cannot be counted on to be fair and impartial.

'This attack was viewed as an attack on the marathon itself - and an attack on Boston,' Mr Mizner told the court, adding the trial needed to be moved to maintain public confidence in the judicial system

However, Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb declared that prospective jurors who have strong opinions had 'unhesitatingly admitted' them, allowing the judge to rule them out as jurors.

Tsarnaev's brother, Tamerlan, died in a shootout with police following the twin bomb attacks. 

Opening statements in the trial are scheduled for Wednesday.
