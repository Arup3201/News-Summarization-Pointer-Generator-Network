The BBC has apologised after one of its radio stations played the sound of a screaming woman and dogs howling over a news bulletin about Oscar Pistorius.

The embarrassing blooper happened as a newsreader for BBC Coventry and Warwickshire read out a report of the first day of the Olympic and Paralympic athlete's murder trial.

Howls are heard over the newsreader as he says the athlete has pleaded not guilty.

Then, as the newsreader says 'he admits shooting Reeva Steenkamp' screams are heard in the background followed by what sounds like laughing.

During the trial that day in Pretoria, prosecution 
witness Michelle Burger told the court she had heard 'bloodcurdling' screams on the night of Ms Steenkamp's death.

Pistorius admits shooting his 29-year-old girlfriend, but denies murder, saying he mistook the model for an intruder.

The blooper happened at around 1pm on Monday on during the Vic Minett show.

At the end of the broadcast, the DJ says: 'Apologies as well for a couple technical problems during that news bulletin. A few odd things sneaking in there.'

The BBC later said the blunder had been the result of a 'technical mistake' after sound effects being put together in another studio for a different programme were 'accidentally broadcast over the new bulletin'.

A spokeswoman said: 'There was a technical mistake where sound effects being prepared in another studio for an unrelated item were accidentally broadcast over the news bulletin.

'We apologised for the error immediately afterwards.'
