Roy Hodgson risks riling Luis Suarez before Thursday’s showdown by claiming the Uruguay striker cannot yet claim to be true world class.

The England manager says Suarez, who scored 31 times for Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League last season and was PFA Player of the Year, cannot be mentioned in the same class as true greats such as Diego Maradona or Pele until he performs wonders at the World Cup.

Suarez is expected to start for Uruguay in the crunch clash with England in Sao Paulo. Speaking after England’s 2-1 defeat against Italy, Hodgson said: ‘He (Suarez) will only be at that level when he shows it on this particular stage.

‘If you are saying “do I think he has got the potential, is he a wonderful footballer?”, yes he sure is.  But if you are really going to put him up there with Maradona, Pele, Beckenbauer and Cruyff, you might argue Messi needs to have that sort of tournament to get up there with the legends. 

‘Pirlo is challenging that category. He has done it time and again, shown what a wonderful footballer he is because this is the stage you have to do it on. 

‘Being a great player in your league will get you lots of plaudits but for the world to recognise you are one of the all-time greats you have to do it at the World Cup.’

Suarez has been recovering from injury and watched Uruguay’s opening game, a 3-1 defeat against Costa Rica, from the substitutes’ bench.

He will be desperate to face an England team which is likely to include five of his Liverpool team-mates. Hodgson turned his attention to Uruguay yesterday after the England team flew back to Rio de Janeiro from Manaus.

Hodgson insists he will not panic but he admitted it is impossible to condition his young England stars to become world beaters overnight.

Hodgson said: ‘We will try to cheer the players up, show them some of the things in the game that were very good and address some of the issues that need to be addressed.

‘But in my time with the national team, that is the most positive performance in many ways that I have seen. 

‘It gives me great hope going forward, not just for the next two games, because we have players who can all develop into very strong players. 

‘You can’t really expect Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck, Adam Lallana, Ross Barkley and Luke Shaw [to have] the experience of De Rossi and Pirlo. 

‘We have to give them games. In a game which was very difficult I don’t think they let anyone down.’

Belief: Hodgson said his team can take plenty of pride from the 2-1 defeat to Italy in Manaus

Encouraging: Daniel Sturridge scored England's goal, a fine move in the first half

Hodgson admitted Italy were more ruthless in front of goal and will demand more from his forward line against Uruguay.

Claudio Marchisio scored Italy’s opener and Mario Balotelli’s 50th-minute header was enough for victory.

Hodgson said: ‘We were not outclassed but they were more ruthless at taking their chances. But the number of chances we created, even during the first half of the second half, should have given us an opportunity to score more than one goal.  We have to be a bit more ruthless.

‘Had we scored two or three goals I don’t think anybody would have said “you were lucky there”.’

Hodgson also admitted he will work on the team’s defensive vulnerability after Italy sliced through England’s backline for their second goal.

Although the perceived weakness was at right back with Glen Johnson, Italy attacked down England’s left flank. They exposed Wayne Rooney, who had been shifted out there, and left-back Leighton Baines.

Sloppy: Hodgson insisted his team will work on their defensive failures from the game

Hodgson said: ‘You can’t blame purely the left-back, we didn’t defend the area that well.  We were playing very offensive wide midfield players, Rooney, Welbeck and Sterling, we are going to get caught in those areas from time to time, I’m afraid. 

‘We did much better second half defending it. The players gave their all.  I certainly wouldn’t be prepared to go and blame anybody.

‘There were some sterling efforts, if you’ll excuse the pun.  It just wasn’t good enough on the night.’

Hodgson was pleased with Sterling’s contribution and he has done more than enough to keep his place.

Hodgson said: ‘The more I work with him, the more I see. At the moment, I am very happy that we can have him in two positions. 

‘We thought with his pace, ability and sharpness around Pirlo and De Rossi, it might help us nullify [them]. However hard you work against them, especially in this heat and humidity, they are going to get on the ball.’

Star man: But on Saturday night, Sterling lit up the World Cup with a fine match against Italy

Hodgson has the option of using Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on Thursday after the England midfielder started ball work following the injury to his right knee.

Hodgson added: ‘I have the opportunity to make changes if I want, but I want to have a close look at the Italy game again.’ 

England’s head physio Gary Lewin has returned home after he fractured an ankle celebrating Daniel Sturridge’s equaliser.

Lewin, a popular member of the England set-up, jumped into the air and landed on a water bottle when Sturridge tucked away Rooney’s cross.

Hodgson said: ‘We will miss him. I am really sad for him but we can cover for him because we have extra physios.

‘For him to have such an unfortunate accident is really sad. We will miss him because he is very experienced, very popular, and close to the players and it was a heart-breaking moment.’
