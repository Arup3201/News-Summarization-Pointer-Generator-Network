A thug travelled 190 miles to hand himself in to police immediately after watching footage of himself attacking an innocent man on Crimewatch.

Christopher Riley, 23, punched Scott Huxtable on a Valentine's Day night out in Bath, Somerset, in an 'unprovoked' attack which left Mr Huxtable unconscious.

CCTV footage captured Riley knocking Mr Huxtable, 23, out cold with a single punch before callously walking away - leaving his victim on the floor.

But Riley’s identity remained a mystery for three months after the attack until a police appeal showing the CCTV was broadcast on BBC Crimewatch on May 2.

He immediately recognised himself in the footage and jumped on a late-night train from his home in Oldham, near Manchester, to Bath - arriving at a local police station three hours later.

Today Riley appeared at Bath Magistrates Court, where he admitted one charge of assault.

Rebecca Gardner, prosecuting, told the court how Riley carried out the 'unprovoked' attack, leaving his victim needing hospital treatment.

She said: 'Without any warning, he punched the victim in the face with his fist hitting the left hand side of his face.

'The force of the punch left the victim on the floor. He was clearly unconscious for an amount of time.

'The defendant left and is not located. He was located after sometime because this was featured on Crimewatch and the defendant saw it.

'Within three hours, he handed himself him.'

Miss Gardner told the court Riley did not know his victim, a Bath University student who had drank so much that he did not remember the attack.

Mr Huxtable - who had his hands in his pockets during the assault - was knocked unconscious when his head hit a metal drain on the floor.

He required five stitches following the punch, which left him with an inch-long cut on his head

The attack took place in Bath’s SouthGate shopping centre at 2.45am on Valentines Day this year after both men had been out clubbing.

Riley handed himself to officers in Bath on May 2. He was arrested and later charged with one count of assault.

Gwen Browne, defending, said Riley had handed him in at Bath’s Mavers Street station as soon as he could following the appeal.

She said: 'This is a defendant who handed himself in to the police as soon as he saw it on Crimewatch.'

Magistrates adjourned the case for sentencing on June 22 at the same court.

Mr Riley was released on unconditional bail.
