Thieves have tried to steal the ashes of Sigmund Freud and his wife.

They broke an ancient Greek urn that contained the couple’s remains after breaking into a cemetery in Golders Green, north London.

The ‘irreplaceable’ urn, which was a gift to the founding father of psychoanalysis from Princess Marie Bonaparte, the great-grandniece of Napoleon, was ‘severely damaged’. The would-be thieves left empty-handed.

The urn was placed in the crematorium following Freud’s death in Hampstead in September 1939.

He died aged 83 after asking his doctor to administer a fatal dose of morphine because his mouth cancer was inoperable.

The ashes of his wife, Martha, were added to the urn when she died in 1951, aged 90.

Sigmund Freud was born in Freiberg, now part of the Czech Republic, on May 6, 1856.

He
 developed psychoanalysis, a method through which an analyst unpacks a patient's
unconscious conflicts based on free associations, dreams and 
fantasies.

His
 theories on child sexuality, libido and the ego, among other topics, were considered some of the most influential academic concepts of the 20th century.

Detective Constable Daniel Candler said: 'This was a despicable act by a callous thief.

'Even leaving aside the financial value 
of the irreplaceable urn and the historical significance of to whom it 
related, the fact that someone set out to take an object knowing it 
contained the last remains of a person defies belief.'

A spokesman for the crematorium said the urn, which was 'severely damaged', has since been moved to a secure location and that security was now under review.

The crematorium in Hoop Lane has been the scene for the funerals of many British celebrities, including authors Bram Stoker, Enid Blyton and more recently Amy Winehouse and Peter Sellers.

Fans of Marc Bolan gather each year 
to mark the anniversary of the former T Rex singer whose plaque is 
alongside one of Keith Moon, The Who's drummer.

Writer and campaigner Lisa Appignanesi, the chairman of the trustees of the Freud Museum, described the urn as ‘irreplaceable’.

She said: ‘Freud received it as a gift from his friend and colleague Princess Marie Bonaparte.’
