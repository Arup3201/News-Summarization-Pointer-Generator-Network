Unhappy: Stuart Lawrence, 35, is preparing to sue Scotland Yard for discrimination claiming he is pulled over without justification 'all the time'

Stephen Lawrence's brother last night claimed police have stopped him 25 times simply because of the colour of his skin.

Stuart Lawrence says he is the victim of a sustained campaign of harassment by Scotland Yard officers.

And his lawyers yesterday lodged a damaging race discrimination complaint against the Metropolitan Police Service.

They say the 35-year-old teacher has been repeatedly pulled over in his car for 'no apparent reason and without any justification'.

His patience snapped after an incident
 on November 16 near the home he shares with his fiancée and 
two-year-old son in Peckham, south London.

Mr Lawrence, whose brother was killed 
by a racist gang, was in his VW Scirocco when two officers stopped him.

After asking why he had been pulled over, he says one of the officers 
replied that he had been 'naturally suspicious' of him.

Mr Lawrence, whose plans to sue the 
Met were revealed by the Mail on Saturday, said: 'I am being targeted 
because of the colour of my skin, I don't think it's because I am 
Stephen's brother.

'Whenever I have been stopped, I have 
never subsequently been charged with anything, and nothing has ever been
 found to be wrong with my car.

'I have never, ever, done anything 
wrong. I have never been in trouble with the law. I have paid my road 
tax and my insurance, and always tried to keep my cars in a roadworthy 
state.

'Of the 25 or so occasions in which I 
have been stopped, only two have been at police checkpoints – where they
 are verifying people's tax and insurance. The rest have been random 
stops.'

In a statement, he added: 'There can be no other reason, apart from racism, for me being stopped so often.

'If I had no road tax, no insurance, 
or if I was driving erratically, I would understand being pulled over. 
But on no occasions was that the case.'

A letter of complaint was sent to 
Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan-Howe yesterday afternoon, outlining 
details of Mr Lawrence's ordeal and the names of the officers involved 
in the latest incident.

In it, his lawyers warn of further 
legal proceedings and state that over 'many years' he has been stopped 
between 20 and 25 times.

Because of the extraordinary 
sensitivity of the case, there is speculation that the Independent 
Police Complaints Commission will be asked to supervise an inquiry into 
the allegations.

The legal move will be of particular 
concern to Home Secretary Theresa May, who last month paid tribute to 
the campaigning work of Stuart and Stephen's mother Doreen.

In 1999, the Met was accused of being 'institutionally racist' by the judicial inquiry into her son's murder six years earlier.

The 18-year-old A-level student was killed by a group of white youths as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London.

Two of that gang, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were jailed for life last January for Stephen's murder.

Mr Lawrence said last night: 'I feel 
angry and frustrated because I sat through the trial of Dobson and 
Norris, and saw some of the mistakes made by police in 1993 and the 
years that followed.

'Now it appears not much progress has
 been made in how they deal with black people. I just want police to do 
their jobs properly. I don't want them to waste time on people like me. 
Their time could be better spent elsewhere, rather than pulling me over.

'They could be out solving crimes. A 
lot of recommendations were made by the Macpherson Inquiry but it seems 
that it hasn't made much difference.

'I would like to know when things are 
going to change, when is there going to be a society where you are not 
pulled over because you are a black guy or a black person driving a 
particular car. The decision to stop someone in their car should be 
based on a sound reason, rather than the colour of your skin.

'I have met some really good police officers who work hard to protect the community.

'But it only takes a small handful of 
people with the wrong type of attitude to make it feel like things have 
not changed since the Macpherson Inquiry.'

He said that as he grew up in south 
London, being regularly stopped by police was something he 'reluctantly 
accepted'. 'But as I am getting older now, the circumstances in which I 
am stopped are more ludicrous and more over the top,' he added.

'I saw the mistakes made by police in 1993 and the years that followed. Not much progress has been made in how they deal with black people.'

'In recent years, I have been stopped 
during my lunch-break at work. The police were checking tax discs. I 
have also been stopped on my first day back to work after the summer 
holidays, which meant I was late for the first briefing meeting for 
work.

'On this occasion, I was pulled over randomly just before I got to the traffic lights.

'I explained this to the officer, that
 I was on my way to work, but he insisted on going through the process 
of checking who I was, and checking my car was taxed, insured and in 
good working order.

'I have reservations now about the type of car I can drive because I don't want to increase the amount of times I am stopped.'

Mr Lawrence's solicitor Imran Khan 
said:  'Stop and search is often used as a litmus test for how the 
police treat those from minority ethnic communities.

'Stuart's experience shows that rather than passing this litmus test, the Metropolitan Police have remained consistently bad.

'Stuart has suffered immeasurably over
 the last 20 years. First with the murder of his brother in 1993, then 
the failures of the police in their investigation into the murder and to
 cap it all being unfairly stopped because of his skin colour.

'Previously Stuart has not complained 
or otherwise drawn attention to what has happened to him, but now, when 
the Metropolitan police seemingly trumpet how things have changed for 
the better, he has felt the need to take action. He has now instructed 
me to use the full force of the law.'

The Metropolitan Police declined to comment last night.
