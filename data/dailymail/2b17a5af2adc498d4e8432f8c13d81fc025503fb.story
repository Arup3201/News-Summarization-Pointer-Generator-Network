A standard test given to potential employees of sports-media giant ESPN has been leaked online, providing wannabes with an idea of the amount of sports knowledge necessary to hold down what could be their dream job.

The test, leaked by Deadspin.com on Friday, in an eight-section assessment of the proficiency of would-be employees with statistics, calculations, and sports knowledge. The test is given by email to job-seekers who apply with ESPN's Stats and Information Group.

People gathered inside of ESPN's Digital Center 2, a new studio opening June 2014 in ESPN's headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut. To get their jobs, employees' love and knowledge of sports were heavily tested.

According to the assessment's instructions, test-takers have a limit of 45 minutes to complete the assignment, with anyone taking longer than that disqualified from employment. The instructions also say that any incomplete answers are marked as wrong, but that tools such as a calculator or the Internet are permitted.

Questions asked include how to calculate a pitcher's ERA (earned run average), how to read an NBA box score, and how to spell the names of notable (if not quite 'star') athletes with interesting surnames. Examples include Dwyane Wade and Tedy Bruschi.

Other questions include naming all of the tennis and golf majors, and matching athletes with their correct teams.

'At ESPN, success has no bias. It’s contagious. If you’ve got what it 
takes, it finds you, grabs you, and rumbles the pit of your stomach.' reads the introductory message of ESPN's careers portal. A look at the listings show that most of their current jobs are at their Bristol, Connecticut headquarters, although they boast numerous other locations throughout the United States.

According to forum postings found on SportsJournalists.com (which date back to 2010 and contain a 2008 version of the same test), this assessment is only the tip of the iceberg for potential applicants. Some accounts claim that they were quizzed on their sports knowledge over the phone before the interview, while others claim that they experienced many in-person interviews with supervisors after taking this test.
