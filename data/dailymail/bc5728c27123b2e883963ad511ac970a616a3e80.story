Anjali Damania says leaders should take the initiative to change AAP, not simply blog or complain

The letters by Admiral L. Ramdas and Prashant Bhushan are the ones that matter, and the issues they raised should be addressed. My objection is that instead of merely raising questions, people should contribute to the party by working for it. 

The problems have to be, and will be, addressed. It won’t take more than a month or so for the party to set everything right. 

Talking about the funds, I will say let the expenses and accounts reach the office. We have fought three elections in a year, which is too much for any small party. 

Every single issue raised is important for the party. The only problem is that this should not be done via the media; it needs to be done by holding internal talks. 

Mayank Gandhi should have demanded that the recordings and the minutes be made public in the meeting which he had attended. What is the meaning of simply raising questions? Every leader needs to think about it. 

If a volunteer is punished when he is wrong, even leaders should be held accountable. The party’s national executive was called only to tackle the problems. 

The issues raised are important, and people should take the onus to set the system right and not simply raise questions or write blogs.

I genuinely feel Prashantji is a very respectful person. When he made those statements, my respect (for him) went down a bit. I would definitely like to see him as a leader of the party. We don’t expect him to make a mistake at all. There is no question of his marginalisation. He should be supported for a larger, better role by everyone. 

Ankit Lal, Ashutosh and Khetan need to apologise sincerely for what they have done. They need to be pulled up. Every volunteer wants transparency on accounts, candidate selection and other decisions. 

We had six months after the Lok Sabha polls. Why didn’t those who raise questions help carve out these mechanisms then? The camp system is wrong and if it exists, it should be demolished. 

I do not want to comment on Yogendra Yadav at all. As a volunteer I beg and plead all leaders to thrash out their differences. 

We should have more faces, there are many leading lights. And women need to be brought forward.
