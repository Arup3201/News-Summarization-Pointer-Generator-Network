Barbara Walters acted as a 'adoptive mother' and 'career adviser' to a glamorous former aide of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

In a string of leaked emails between Sheherazad Jafaari
 and the celebrated broadcaster, Ms Walters, 82, promised to her help the 22-year-old secure a job on Piers Morgan's CNN show and win a place at Columbia University.

Ms Jafaari, whose father is Syria's U.S. ambassador, was one of Assad's closest advisers and one one of three women revealed in an earlier leak to have sent lovestruck emails to the dictator.

Making headlines: Barbara Walters was the first and only American journalist to interview Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December in the midst of violent uprisings in his country that have left thousands dead

Statement: Sheherazad 'Sherry' Jaafari has said she 'did what any ambitious American girl would do' in helping out her country in its time of need

In one email, Ms Walters told 'Sherry' 
how she had written to CNN host Piers Morgan and his top producer to 
'say how terrific you are' in hopes of helping her get a job at Piers 
Morgan Tonight.

The young woman responded, writing 'You can never be a better mom to your adopted child (me).'

Messages leaked by Syrian rebels in March show her asking another of Mr Assad's advisers to tell him: 'I love him so so so much and that I miss him.'

The leak revealed flirtatious and suggestive emails from three admirers, including a provocative photograph of an unknown woman in white lingerie.

Mrs Walters first began dealing with Ms Jaafari when ABC News was in talks to arrange the first and only televised interview for an American network with the Syrian leader.

In the interview, Ms Walters pressed the president about the thousands of deaths of Syrian citizens and he denied having issued any formal command for such force.

The Telegraph, who published the most recent batch of hacked emails between Ms Walters and Ms Jaafari, reported that the interview was received poorly by Syrian government officials because it ended up being more harsh on Assad than they originally expected.

Shortly after, Ms Jaafari emailed Ms Walters in a panic, writing that she was 'in so much trouble' over the interview.

A few weeks  later, Ms Jaafari had determined that it was time for her to get out of Syria and join her father in the U.S.- all the while remaining extremely loyal to Assad, who she called 'the Dude'. In other emails obtained by The Guardian in March, Ms Jaafari wrote that 'this man is loved by his people'.

Ms Walters and Jaafari continued to talk via email long after the interview aired

Upon her move from Syria, Ms Jaafari applied to Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, and hope to translate her time working as a press aide to Assad into a staff position at a major American news outlet.

Ms Walters immediately dismissed any talk of her working for ABC since it would be a breach of journalistic ethics. Instead, she offered to reach out on behalf of the 'dear girl'.

The pair appear extremely close, with Ms Walters signing her emails with ‘hugs’ and ‘love’ and Ms Jaafari promising to bring back jewellery from Syria for her so-called adoptive mother.

Their email exchange was obtained by Syrian opposition forces who then passed them on to The Telegraph.

Walters signed emails 'hugs' and 'love'

Ms Walters emailed Columbia Journalism School professor Richard Wald, former president of NBC News and vice president of ABC News, to sing Ms Jaafari's praises.

'She is brilliant, beautiful, speaks five languages. Anything you can do to help?' Ms Walters wrote at the end of January.

Mr Wald responded that while his position at the Journalism School is unconnected to the School of International and Public Affairs, he would do his best to help, saying that 'through the Admissions Office network, I will get them to give her special attention. I am sure they will take her.'

The attention did not appear to be enough to help the now-22-year-old, as she was not accepted to the program.

Mr Wald's son, Jonathan Wald, is the executive producer of Piers Morgan Tonight, was also the recipient of an email from Ms Walters.

She told Ms Jaafari that she wrote to both Jonathan Wald and Piers Morgan on her behalf and passed along her resume for their consideration, even though she was unsure if they had any availability. That specific email was not released.

Neither Ms Walters nor Ms Jaafari heard back from CNN or the younger Mr Wald.

In the wake of the emails, Ms Walters released a statement expressing her 'regret' for the questionable decision.

'In the aftermath (of the Assad interview), Ms Jaafari returned to the US and contacted me looking for a job. I told her that was a serious conflict of interest and that we would not hire her,' Ms Walters said in the statement. 

'I did offer to mention her to contacts at another media organisation and in academia, though she didn't get a job or into school. In retrospect, I realise that this created a conflict and I regret that.'
