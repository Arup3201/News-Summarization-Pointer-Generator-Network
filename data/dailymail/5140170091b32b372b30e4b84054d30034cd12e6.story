Patients will wait no longer than a week to receive test results for cancer under a Labour government, Ed Miliband has pledged.

The Labour leader said the cost of the pledge would be met by a £150million-a-year levy on tobacco companies, with most of that cash going towards more testing equipment.

But medical chiefs warned that the 'simply buying new equipment' would not solve the problem. 

Ed Miliband has pledged that patients will receive cancer test results within a week, should Labour come to power after next year's General Election

In an interview with The Times from a first-class carriage of an East Coast Main Line train from London to his Doncaster constituency, Mr Miliband promised to make tackling cancer a priority if Labour come to power after next year's General Election.

He said: 'One in three of us is going to get cancer during our lifetime — that's incredibly scary. It's a massive killer.

'The number of people waiting more than six weeks has doubled — we are talking about millions of people each year.' 

But medical bodies questioned whether Mr Miliband's seven-day pledge would work in practice. 

Giles Maskell, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said: 'Simply buying newer and better equipment is not the answer unless you have the people to operate it and interpret the results.'

1) Cancer test within a week

2) GP appointment in 48 hours

3) Thousands more doctors and nurses

4) Social care champion for the elderly

5) Spending on competition lawyers and privatisation to be scrapped

Suzy Lishman, from the Royal College of Pathologists, said: 'There is no 'one size fits all' test for cancer diagnosis and many patients require more than one test.'

A total of 10,600 people waited longer than six weeks to receive routine cancer test results, the latest official statistics showed. 

The NHS aims for 93 per cent of patients who may have cancer to be seen by a specialist within two weeks - a benchmark which has been met.

However, another target - for 85 per cent of cancer sufferers to begin treatment within 62 days of being referred by a GP - has been missed in recent months. 

Labour has already promised that people will be able to book appointments to see their GP within 48 hours, as the party looks to focus their campaigning around the NHS (file picture)

Labour has already promised that patients will be able to book an appointment with a GP within 48 hours, as the party looks to capitalise on the NHS being one of the few sectors the public trusts them with more than the Conservatives.

The one-week cancer test results promise would be in place by 2020 and is one of five 'patient guarantees' that the party is making. 

Just under six per cent on NHS spending goes towards cancer, which kills around 160,000 people a year in the UK. Labour claims that diagnosing cancer earlier would reduce costs.

Cancer charities welcomed the Labour promise. Rosie Loftus, from Macmillan Cancer Support, said: 'Far too many cancer patients are diagnosed far too late to have a fighting chance of long-term survival.'
