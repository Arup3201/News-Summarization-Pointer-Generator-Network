A German job agency has devised an unusual advertisement campaign to encourage people to switch jobs - by depicting humans as doing the works of ATMs and vending machines.

Using the slogan ‘Life’s too short for the wrong job’, the posters show what ‘really’ goes on inside a number of everyday machines from washers to jukeboxes.

One particularly bizarre poster shows a man’s naked behind with the grammatically incorrect tagline ‘There are better ways to make career’ with a crowd directed to walk through a strategically placed hole in the poster.

Another poster shows a 
multi-instrument musician squeezed into a jukebox, patiently waiting for a woman to make her choice of song.

A third 
ad depicts a woman sweating to hand-wash a young man's clothes inside the cramped 'back-room' of a washing machine
at a launderette.

In one a toy truck is given the x-ray
treatment, revealing that it is being pedalled by a man, battered and 
bruised by his monotonous job.

Working like a machine: The campaign is designed to encourage people to leave jobs they are unhappy about

The campaign, created by agency Scholz
& Friends Berlin, have been running since 2005 and have won 
multiple awards over the years.

Its aim is to challenge workers unhappy in the workplace to look for a new career.

The billboards and posters were placed to target commuters on their way to work, making them question their choice of occupation, the agency said in 2005.
