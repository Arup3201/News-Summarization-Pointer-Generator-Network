After a scorching weekend for many, hopes were high for balmy weather during the upcoming bank holiday.

Sadly, we’re set for a washout.

Forecasters say heavy rain is expected throughout the weekend.

A spell of low pressure will sweep across Britain on Friday, causing misery for those heading for festivals, sports events or holidays.

The Environment Agency had issued a flood alert along the River Irwell, but these motorists in Ramsbottom were still caught on the hop

The turbulent weather will rekindle 
memories of the Jubilee weekend in June, when street parties across the 
country were sullied by drizzle.

The Thames river pageant also proved a
nightmare for spectators, many of whom travelled to London only to be 
drenched by heavy showers.

The prospect of yet another dreary 
bank holiday is even harder to swallow given recent sunny spells.

Department of Health officials issued a heatwave alert for the 
south-east and east of England at the weekend, with the mercury reaching
32C (90F) in the village of Cavendish in Suffolk.

However, Meteogroup’s Paul Knightley 
said: ‘Last week’s hot weather is being shoved aside rather rudely by a 
succession of areas of low pressure coming in from the west.’

He warned 
that rain would affect most parts of England and Wales over the weekend.

The forecaster added that showers 
would arrive in parts of south-west England and Wales on Friday.

He 
expects southern England to see the worst of the weather on Saturday.

‘Sunday looks the best day of the 
holiday, although temperatures in Scotland are not expected to exceed 
15C (59F),’ he said.

‘Monday could see wind and rain spreading from the 
south-west.

‘It’s certainly not looking good for the weekend. You could say it’s going to be typical bank holiday weather.’

The rugby league Challenge Cup at 
Wembley, horse-racing at Cheltenham, the Reading and Leeds music 
festivals and the Notting Hill carnival are among the events set to be 
affected.

Some areas have already had a taste of what’s to come, with thunderstorms and rain causing flash-flooding yesterday.

Motorists in Ramsbottom, Lancashire, 
found themselves driving through several feet of water as clouds 
unleashed huge amounts of rain in just 20 minutes.

Meteogroup said Yorkshire was also exceedingly wet, with a quarter of an inch (6.8mm) falling in one short period.

Last weekend, temperatures as high as
32C (90F) were recorded, but the thermometer is not expected to reach 
higher than 20C (68F) over the late August bank holiday weekend.

Families heading away for the weekend will face the added problem of petrol prices which have soared by 6p-a-litre since the start of the summer, the AA reported.

Crowds packed Brighton beach and other open spaces in the South-East on Saturday as temperatures soared to 32.4C (86F)

Having peaked at an average of 142.48p a litre in mid April, petrol fell to 130.81p by July 1 but has now gone up to just under 137p a litre.

Diesel was as high as 147.93p a litre in mid April then fell to 136.12p on July 1 and has now risen to 141.66p.

The AA added that 46 per cent of its members were likely to travel over the bank holiday weekend, with people in Northern Ireland and north-east England most likely to take to the road and Scots the happiest to stay at home.

For those getting out in the car, a day trip is the most popular outing at 42 per cent, while a third favour a weekend and just under a fifth are heading off for a longer holiday.

Road information company Trafficmaster said trouble-spots would include the M3/M27/A31 to the Dorset coast, the M5 to south-west England and A303 through Hampshire, Wiltshire and Somerset.
