For 20 years he denied any part in the racist killing of Stephen Lawrence.

But finally – after a private prosecution, landmark public inquiry, years of police investigations  and a murder conviction – Gary Dobson has admitted his guilt.

The 37-year-old yesterday abandoned his appeal against that conviction – a development that raises hopes of him turning ‘supergrass’.

Detectives are expected to consider visiting him in prison to urge him to turn in the rest of the gang that killed Stephen in 1993.

David Norris, the second murderer jailed last year, is continuing with plans to appeal against his conviction but police are confident the 36-year-old gangster’s son will fail.

Dobson’s decision was welcomed by Stephen’s mother Doreen. In a moving statement, she spoke of the ‘pain and heartbreak’ of the years she has spent waiting for his confession.

Mrs Lawrence said: ‘It took me and my family almost 20 years to get justice for my son Stephen when Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted of the murder in January 2012.

‘In those years I had put my grieving on hold and had to struggle against police racism. It would have been a great comfort to me and my family if Gary Dobson or his accomplices had admitted what they had done.

‘Now that Gary Dobson has dropped his appeal I can only assume it is because he has finally admitted he murdered Stephen. 

‘He could have done this much earlier and avoided the pain and heartache me and my family have had to suffer over so many years.

‘I now hope that David Norris will do the same and avoid prolonging my pain. I also hope that those others who were involved on the 22nd April 1993 follow Gary Dobson’s lead and admit their own involvement.’

Dobson’s decision is a huge boost to Mrs Lawrence and her family as they prepare for a memorial service that will mark exactly two decades since Stephen’s murder.

And it is likely to re-energise the Metropolitan Police’s marathon quest to lock up the entire gang of five suspected of stabbing the 18-year-old to death in Eltham, South-East London.

Yesterday, a senior Scotland Yard detective said the inquiry remains ‘live and active’.

The Daily Mail has campaigned for 16 years for justice for Stephen. In February 1997, we published pictures of the five suspects – including Dobson and Norris – under the headline ‘Murderers’ and challenged them to sue us if we were wrong.

No legal action was ever taken. We repeated the same front page in July 2006, and yet again none of the race-hate yobs issued proceedings.

Our acclaimed campaign exposed police failings and led to the setting up of a public inquiry that branded the Met ‘institutionally racist’.

It also sparked legal changes that allowed Dobson, previously acquitted of Stephen’s murder, to stand trial again.

After both were found guilty in 
January last year, Dobson was ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years and
two months, while Norris was given a minimum of 14 years and three 
months.

Father-of-two 
Dobson and Norris, who has five children from various relationships, 
were finally trapped following an expert review of forensic evidence 
from the original investigation. Fibres and hairs linked them to their 
victim.

Dobson’s appeal focused on challenging the integrity of the forensic evidence.

Ever since his conviction, his legal team has tried in vain to undermine its credibility.

Sources
say Norris is appealing on the basis that the use in evidence of a 
surveillance video showing him to be racist was unfair. Last summer, 
applications for permission to appeal by both men were rejected by a 
single judge who considered the papers from the case.

But Dobson and Norris still had the right to renew their applications before judges sitting at the Court of Appeal.

A spokesman for the Judicial Office confirmed yesterday that Dobson had shelved his appeal.

He
could receive a significant reduction in his prison sentence if he 
testifies against fellow, unconvicted members of the murder gang.

Police
believe they have exhausted all opportunities to gather new forensic 
evidence in the Lawrence case, meaning their best chance of nailing the 
other gang members is if a new witness comes forward – or Dobson tells 
the truth.

Because he 
pleaded not guilty at his trial, Dobson would have to come up with 
compelling new evidence to have any chance of a sentence reduction.

In
1994, Stephen’s family brought a failed private prosecution against 
Dobson and Norris and brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight.

Dobson
and Norris are believed to have spent up to £1million of public money 
on defence costs before and during their murder trial. But the Legal 
Services Commission has blocked a request for information as to how 
much.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
