These amazing pictures show the contrast between how Christmas looked when it was celebrated in London in the past and how it is celebrated now. 

Bringing together past and present in one extraordinary picture, the digital composites show familiar scenes from the city centre today juxtaposed with the same scene decades ago.

The pictures, by Getty Images, show everyday scenes of Christmas in the capital over the years - and feature sandbags, a group of Father Christmas impersonators waiting for the bus at Holborn in 1960 and carol singers.

Other images show a modern day Watling Street featuring dozens of Christmas turkeys hanging outside - something today's health and safety inspectors would probably not approve of.

This picture features Clapham Junction in 1926  and in 2014. The picture from 1926 shows Father Christmas arriving at the Arding and Hobbs store where he is greeted by dozens of excited children, contrasted with shoppers walking past what is now a Debenhams store in 2014

This digital composite shows St Paul's Cathedral in 1950  and in 2014 - the Christmas tree was brought from the royal estates at Windsor

The photo shows Selfridges department store in 1935 and in 2014 - in 1935 the Oxford Street shop was lit up by dozens of Christmas trees

This digital composite contrasts Parliament Square in 1938 and today. On Christmas Eve 1938 the statue of Lord Beaconsfield in front of the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben was coated with a light dusting of snow - today it is surrounded by a busy stream of constant traffic

Regent Street in 2014 is contrasted with a picture of the street in 1940. The older picture shows Father Christmas may have exchanged his civilian red hood for a warlike 'tin hat' during the Second World War but blitz or no blitz, he is determined to deliver his goods this year
