So who is Michael J Garcia, FIFA’s independent ethics investigator, and the man who has effectively thrown a grenade into the World Cup bidding process?

The American lawyer is a partner for a top law firm, Kirkland’s, based in New York and Washington.

Before joining the company he led 250 lawyers as US attorney for the southern district of New York

During that time, he personally prosecuted a number of high-profile cases, including the 1993 terrorist bombing of the World Trade Centre and the 1998 bombing of American embassies in East Africa.

For his work on these cases, Garcia was twice awarded the Department of Justice's Exceptional Service Award, the Department's highest honour, as well as the Distinguished Service Award.

Between 2005 and 2008 he was US attorney. Again his focus was on high-profile insider trading, public corruption matters and fraud in the oil-for-food programme.

Garcia has also been Interpol’s vice-president of the Americas and served on the executive committee, the body charged with overseeing the budget and strategic direction of the organisation.

He was appointed by Sepp Blatter in 2012 to investigate allegations of corruption in world football and given authority to order fresh probes into other old cases.

‘He will have not only to write, but the duty to have this case analysed on ethic, moral matters and then to report back to the executive committee,’ Blatter said at a news conference to announce his appointment.

In an interview given to the New York Times in 2006, Garcia, who is married to an FBI agent and has three children, revealed that his aim was to ‘punish people who do bad things and break the law.’

Garcia grew up in Long Island, majored in American literature and wrote his master’s thesis on Mark Twain. He says that The Count of Monte Cristo is his idea of relaxing reading. He earned a scholarship to the Albany Law School of Union University.
