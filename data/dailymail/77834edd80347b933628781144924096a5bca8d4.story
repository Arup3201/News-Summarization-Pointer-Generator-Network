If his critics had had it all their way over the past couple of years, Ally McCoist’s role in life would have been more akin to Kindergarten Cop than that of the manager of Rangers.

Each time the blue juggernaut has deviated from its path, the accusation invariably levelled at the man at the wheel is that his alleged aversion to blooding young players is the root of the problem.

In McCoist’s view, there is only one small problem with that well-worn theory, however. That it has  absolutely no foundation in fact.

Creating a pathway: Ally McCoist insists youngsters will be given a chance if they are good enough

The Rangers manager makes no apology whatsoever for welcoming 30-somethings Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd back into the fold. Nor does he blink an eyebrow at running the rule over former Hearts defender Marius Zaliukas in Brora over the coming days.

Yet just because McCoist has turned to tried and tested operators in order to guide Rangers out of the Championship at the first time of asking, it doesn’t mean the manager has bolted the door on the Murray Park youth wing. Far from it, in fact.

‘We are not ignoring kids — it’s a nonsense to suggest otherwise,’ McCoist said. ‘You can’t flood your team with kids and then expect to get through two divisions like we’ve done. It wouldn’t have happened.

‘If we’d fielded a team of kids in the Third Division, we wouldn’t have won the league. It’s an unfair criticism levelled at the league.

Familiar face: Marius Zaliukas is having a second trial at the club

‘There has never been a case in recent Old Firm history where five or six kids have come through the ranks and into the first team.

‘Other than at Manchester United in the early 1990s, it hasn’t  happened anywhere.

‘But it doesn’t change my opinion. If the younger lads coming through are good enough — they will play.

‘Guys like Lewis Macleod and Fraser Aird have come in and they’ve stayed in. Others like Calum Gallagher and Robbie Crawford are there on the fringes. We’ ll continue, absolutely, to give the younger ones a chance.’

You don’t send a boy to do a man’s job, however, and in Boyd and Miller, McCoist has reunited the kind of strike force that will be required if the club are to cope with the obvious step up in quality from League One.

Miller may be 34 but the desire to bulge nets up and down the land remains as strong as when he burst through as a teenager at Hibernian.

Boyd, four years Miller’s junior, is almost unrecognisable from the player who — for all his exploits in front of goal — often seemed to be playing within himself in his first spell at Ibrox.

Experienced: Kris Boyd is expected to spearhead Rangers' attack

‘I’m really delighted with the signings so far,’ McCoist added. ‘I can understand people being  sceptical with players coming back and the ages of the players.‘But at the same time we are not in a position to plan longer term.

‘Finances are dictating that the job is to get out of the division until the time we can again spend money and bring players in.

‘I looked at the situation up front. A year ago, Kenny was scoring at Wembley for Scotland and Kris was unbelievable at Killie last season.

‘I was really impressed with their desire to come back, do well and be part of our journey. These guys are hungry. I was the same myself. When you are reaching 30, a fear goes through you that you are nearing the end of your career.

‘There is a desire and a  determination to look after yourself and play on as long as you can.

Looking on: McCoist will cast an eye over his squad in Thursday night's friendly with Buckie Thistle

‘Darren McGregor is another player I have always liked. He’s had a tough time of things of late through serious injury, but there has been an improvement in him.

‘He’s quick, strong and brave. He will continue his development with us.’

You wouldn’t bet against the former St Mirren man being paired with Zaliukas at the heart of Rangers’ defence by the time hostilities begin.

McCoist tried to land the Lithuanian a year ago, only for him to move to Leeds, but leapt at the chance to assess him in person once it became clear the Elland Road club were prepared to cancel his contract.

Yet, even if a deal can be thrashed out, McCoist hopes that won’t be the end of his business in this window.

‘I’m still looking,’ he said. ‘There’s still a bit of budget to play with. I definitely think we’ve strengthened.

Recommendation: Former Leeds boss Brian McDermott has spoken highly of Zaliukas

‘But we had to strengthen and we need to continue strengthening. I’ll certainly be looking to do that.

‘Big Marius has come up to train with us for a couple of days. Ismael Bouzid is also training back down the road.

‘We wanted to take him last year but he went down to Leeds. I’d imagine finance might have played a part in that, which is fair enough.

‘We watched a good few Leeds games last year and spoke with (former manager) Brian McDermott the other night.

‘If we can bring him in then great but there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge before that.

‘In an ideal world, we’ll hopefully get a defender in. But I’m looking everywhere. I’m looking for another midfield player within my budget.’

Getting back to it: Rangers captain Lee McCulloch in training this week

McCoist, who will have to do without Jon Daly for ‘a number of weeks’ due to the Irishman’s knee problem, gets the first look at his new side when they face Buckie Thistle on Thursday night. It is the first preparatory step for the Ibrox men as they face up to life in what is likely to be the country’s most competitive league.

‘Part of me still can’t believe Hibs are in the league as well,’ McCoist continued. ‘It’s just added to the whole interest.

‘A lot of people will have us down as favourites. I can understand that. Whereas the past two years, in the minds of many of the supporters and the media, it was a given. I don’t think there’s the same feeling about this season.

‘From our point of view, strange as it may sound, that’s a good thing.’
