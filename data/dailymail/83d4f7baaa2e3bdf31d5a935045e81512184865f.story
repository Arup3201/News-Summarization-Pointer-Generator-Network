A company set up and operated by Victoria Beckham’s brother-in-law is at the centre of a fraud investigation after an elderly woman was duped out of her life savings.

It is alleged that staff working for Darren Flood, who is married to Mrs Beckham’s younger sister Louise, even namechecked the former Spice Girl in their sales pitch, claiming ‘if Victoria Beckham’s relative is investing with us, it must be fine’.

Specialist officers are looking into allegations that an 83-year-old widow was grossly overcharged for investments. Five people connected to the company have been arrested and questioned about how she handed over £235,000 for precious metals, diamonds and even plots of land in Brazil.

Mr Flood, 35, was a director of one of the companies used for the bulk of the alleged fraudulent sales. There is no suggestion he is involved in any wrongdoing or that he was aware of the use of the Beckham name. However, if true, the allegations will be embarrassing to both David and Victoria who have a close relationship with Mr Flood. He married Louise at their Hertfordshire mansion in 2009.

Shortly after starting the company in 2012, his staff are alleged to have contacted the pensioner at her home offering her investments in gold bullion.

She decided to hand over thousands after being picked up from her home in Woking, Surrey, and taken for a tour of its ‘virtual office’ in Canary Wharf – where the firm had rented a mailbox.

The day also allegedly included her being ‘rewarded’ with an expensive lunch. It was only when her bank manager queried the huge sums leaving her account that police were alerted and an investigation opened.

The widow, who has no children, told the Mail the Beckham name and use of the Queen’s bank Coutts were used to convince her to invest her life savings. She said: ‘They were very persistent. At first I was only asked to invest small amounts of money, but the sums soon got bigger. They seemed very genuine.

‘One of the men said, “If Victoria Beckham’s relative is investing with us it must be fine”. This all made me think it was bona fide. I was relying on those savings to help me out in my old age and cover any care I may need, but now I have to watch what I spend and shop in charity shops.’

A Surrey police spokesman said: ‘All those arrested are due to return on police bail in April while the investigation continues.’ Mr Flood has not been arrested and when contacted his wife said he would not be commenting.
