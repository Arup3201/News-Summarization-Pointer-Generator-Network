Locals have created a Facebook page for Herschel 'Bud' Moore to raise funds for the WWII veteran who was robbed inside his home in Indiana 

An Indiana war hero was tied up and assaulted in his own home as two raiders stole a large amount of cash. 

Herschel 'Bud' Moore was assaulted on Friday as the two men robbed his home in Arcadia, Hamilton County in Indiana. 

The 94-year-old victim was tied up and beaten by the two robbers, although the World War II veteran managed to bite one of his assailants on the finger. 

Deputy Bryant Orem confirmed the men took a large amount of money during Friday's home invasion. 

Hamilton County Sheriff's Department confirmed that the men also ransacked the house.  

According to the Indystar.com the victim managed to free himself and call for help after Friday's raid.

Deputy Orem said the two suspects are believed to have been white and both wore masks. 

A social media campaign supporting the veteran has been launched. A Go Fund Me account as has so far raised $315 out of $5,000 in the first 12 hours of fundraising. 

A Facebook page, featuring the elderly veteran's shocking industry has been established.

It is calling for anyone who knows the attackers to contact the sheriff's department so the attackers can be arrested.  

Moore suffered extensive bruising to the side of his face as he was pistol-whipped by the two assailants. 

It is understood that police have identified two suspects who they want to talk to in connection with the case.

Moore's friend Mike Probst told WTHR.com that there is a great deal of anger in the community. He said he was 'pretty much irate. Made me mad that someone would go in and do this to a helpless man.

'Hopefully justice prevails and either the police or someone else will find them and I'm sure...they'll get their karma.'
