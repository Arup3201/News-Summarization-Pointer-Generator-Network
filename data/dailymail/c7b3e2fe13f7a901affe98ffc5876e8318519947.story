Tom Arscott scored a hat-trick as Sale secured their first Aviva Premiership win of the season with a 46-8 thumping of London Welsh.

Tries from Arscott and Vadim Cobilas, along with five points from the boot of Danny Cipriani, gave the Sharks a 15-3 advantage at the interval, with Welsh’s only response in the first 40 minutes coming through an Olly Barkley penalty.

Cipriani kicked his second three-pointer of the afternoon to extend the hosts’ lead after the break.

Nic Reynolds’ touchdown gave the visitors hope, but Arscott went over for the second time to seal the win and Tom Brady scored late on to garner a vital bonus point. Arscott then completed his hat-trick before Luke McLean touched down in the last minute.

Both sides went into the game with a record of two defeats from two games, although the visitors at least had the excuse of having to integrate 25 new signings.

Although Bath and Gloucester are expected to challenge for the top six, narrow losses to the West Country teams represented a frustrating opening to the campaign for Steve Diamond’s Sharks.

Two weeks ago against Mike Ford’s men, Sale lacked intensity in the initial exchanges and found themselves 7-0 down almost from the kick-off.

This time they were on the front foot from the off, touching down within three minutes when Cipriani, McLean, Johnny Leota and Will Addison combined to send Arscott over against his former club.

The victory was Sale Sharks' first of the Aviva Premiership season

It was the perfect start for the hosts, but a poor one for a visiting side who had shipped over 100 points so far in the Premiership.

To their credit, the Exiles fought back and went through the phases in the opposition half before an offside infringement allowed Barkley to reduce the arrears with a penalty.

Welsh then had a second three-point opportunity as Sale’s poor ball-handling skills and indiscipline let them down, but the visiting stand-off was awry from the tee.

That was to prove costly for the away team as Diamond’s men once again exerted pressure on the Oxford-based outfit’s line and Cobilas eventually bundled his way over.

Cipriani was on target with the extras as Sharks opened up a 12-3 lead.

It was a disappointing performance from the visitors who have shipped over 100 points so far this season

The Manchester team continued to dominate possession and territory and extended their lead at the break via a three-pointer from their fly-half, following a yellow card to Dean Schofield.

Down to 14 men, the Exiles were on the back foot at the start of the second period when a powerful Sale scrum resulted in a penalty which the hosts’ pivot duly converted.

Justin Burnell’s team showed some fight, though, and had chances in the Sale 22 before they finally - and deservedly - broke through after 57 minutes when Reynolds went over.

But the Sharks lifted the intensity and effectively sealed the victory when Arscott crossed for his second score, converted by Cipriani.

Brady touched down to clinch the bonus point before Arscott completed his hat-trick a minute later when Michael Paterson collected the re-start.

McLean then went over in the final minute to seal a comfortable win.
