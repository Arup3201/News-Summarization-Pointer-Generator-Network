A college student has admitted hanging a large Nazi flag on his college campus and posting anti-Islam fliers as a 'joke' to provoke a reaction.

The student at the historically liberal Oberlin College in Ohio also admitted posting the face of the college president onto a picture of Adolf Hitler, according to a police report.

But he denied responsibility for earlier racist postings and said he was trying to show people had overreacted to them.

Nazi flag: A college student has admitted hanging a racist flier on campus at Oberlin College, Ohio, and posting anti-Islam flyers. It was meant as a 'joke', he said

Police are not pressing charges against the young man, who has not been identified, but he is being disciplined by his college.

He was held by campus security in February after allegedly being seen posting 1,000 anti-Islam fliers in the college's Science Center.

The student, whose name was blacked out 
in an official report, said the people who put up earlier fliers were 
just looking for attention.

'I put out these fliers to get a similar over-reaction to prove this point,' the student said, according to the report.

Offensive: The flag with a swastika on it appeared on campus after a series of postings and incidents over the winter caused an uproar at Oberlin

A series of postings and incidents over the winter caused an uproar at Oberlin, which was one of the first U.S. universities to admit black students.

Black History Month posters were defaced, a 'whites only' sign placed above a water fountain and a swastika drawn on a window.

In early March, classes were cancelled after a report of someone wearing what looked like a Ku Klux Klan-type hooded robe on campus.

A second student detained the same day denied helping make a swastika banner placed in the centre and also denied he knew what his friend was up to, saying he was just tagging along, according to his statement.

An Oberlin College spokesman Scott Wargo said both students are going through the school's disciplinary system.

'You had fliers with threats of violence and hate speech and rape that are being posted on doors and in hallways and on mailboxes,' he said.

'It didn't make it less real for those who had to endure it firsthand, and creating an atmosphere where people are afraid and feel threatened - it isn't a joke.'
