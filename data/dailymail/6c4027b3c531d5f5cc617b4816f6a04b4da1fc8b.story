Action movie fans pay attention.

Hollywood toughguy Arnold Schwarzeneger has offered one lucky person a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to sit in a tank with him and 'crush things'.

To demonstrate, the 66-year-old Terminator star has produced a video that sees him roll over a 5ft roll of bubble wrap with his own personal tank.

Hasta la vista, egg: If you've ever wanted to see Arnold Schwarzenegger crush a 5-foot roll of bubble wrap with his own personal tank (and really, who hasn't?), congratulations! Today is your lucky day

He's back: Hollywood toughguy Arnold Schwarzenegger is helping raise cash for charity by offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to crush things with him

The former California Governor also rams a giant Easter egg and - among other things - taxis, a piano and 66 birthday cakes.

The offer is part of lottery put on by the charity Omaze which sells what are essentially raffle tickets for 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunities' like hanging out with a celebrity for a day, to visiting SpaceX HQ.

The Omaze contest to go to California is up for another two days. If you win, you get to roll around with Arnie himself in Los Angeles, smashing stuff in his tank and smoking cigars.

The cash raised will go to the U.S. charity After-School All-Stars, which helps to fund after-school fitness programs for kids.

According to the description of the video on Schwarzenegger's YouTube channel: 'This idea came from Reddit, so I want to give credit where credit is due.

'Specifically, it came from "ipeeinyourshower" who has better taste in video ideas for charity than usernames.'

Consider that a divorce: Arnie crushes another item in his own personal tank
