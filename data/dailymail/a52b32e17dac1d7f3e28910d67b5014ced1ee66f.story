As far as dream jobs go manhandling a 400kg alligator called Brutus wouldn’t be one of them, but for keepers at the Australian Reptile Park it’s just another day at the office.

On Wednesday keepers at the park in Somersby on the Central Coast successfully removed a rogue American alligator from its lagoon of 30 with as little of fuss as possible.

Head of Reptiles, Billy Collett, led the operation, and it wasn’t a job for the fainthearted as Brutus had been playing up for weeks.

It takes five Australian Reptile Park keepers to keep Brutus pinned to the ground during part of the operation

Tails you win, heads you lose: Mr Collett steers well clear of Brutus' immense jaws as he's put into an isolation enclosure 

‘He is a younger male, full of testosterone. He’s causing lots of trouble; biting our boat, chasing us around while we’re nest raiding and causing many injuries among the alligators,’ he said.

‘It was critical we caught him and moved him to a time out pen.’

So just how do you move an almost 400kg alligator? With great difficulty as it turned out. But Mr Collett and his team had been through this before and took it all in their stride. 

How's that for a poke in the eye? Australian Reptile Park keepers use a pole to keep Brutus at bay 

Say cheese! Brutus is successfully roped by the keepers after being lured out of his lagoon with food

One, two, three, heave! After roping Brutus, keepers drag him from the lagoon so that he can be restrained 

‘It takes eight very experienced keepers. He was lured from the lagoon with food, roped, restrained and then tied to a board so he could be walked 500 metres to his isolation enclosure,’ Mr Collett said.

‘The exercise went to plan. Brutus will remain in isolation until autumn. Alligators are less active as the weather becomes cooler, so when it does, we’ll reintroduce him into the lagoon.’

After being tied to a board, Brutus is carried 500 metres by keepers to his isolation enclosure 

Now that wasn't too bad was it? Mr Collett checks Brutus to see that he is OK before releasing him into the isolation enclosure 

There are a variety of reptiles, including snakes, lizards, alligators and crocodiles at the park, as well as other Australian animals, such as kangaroos, cassowaries and Tasmanian devils.

The park is also heavily involved in snake and spider venom collection for use in the production of Anti-venom and is credited for saving thousands of lives.
