A 25-year-old football supporter has pleaded guilty to going into an area banned to supporters when he confronted Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.

The incident happened at the end of the Barclays Premier League match at St Mary's on January 1, which home side Southampton won 2-0.

Luke Bryant, of Bankhill Drive, Lymington, Hampshire, was arrested and subsequently charged with an offence of going on to an area adjacent to the playing area contrary to the Football (Offences) Act 1991.

He appeared at Southampton Magistrates' Court, where he entered a guilty plea to the offence.

The case was adjourned for a hearing to be held on February 27 to determine whether Bryant should be made the subject of a Football Banning Order.

The defendant was released on conditional bail until then.

The arrest came after Bryant was seen to run with his arms outstretched in front of the Gunners' boss as he sat in the dugout late on in the game.

Footage showed him being bundled away down the tunnel by two stewards as Wenger held his arm out in apparent frustration at the intruder.
