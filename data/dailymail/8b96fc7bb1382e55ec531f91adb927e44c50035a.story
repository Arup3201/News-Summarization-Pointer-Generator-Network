Bill Cosby says he only expects the 'black media' to stay 'neutral' and give him a fair hearing over mounting rape claims.

The 77-year-old said that African-American media should be impartial in reporting the allegations that he is a serial rapist.

'Let me say this. I only expect the black media to uphold the standards of excellence in journalism and when you do that you have to go in with a neutral mind,' Cosby told Page Six.

'Love and strength': Bill Cosby, left, has praised his wife of fifty years, Camille, right, for the 'love and strength' she has displayed

In the telephone interview Cosby also praised his wife's 'love and strength'.

Dozens of women have come forward to claim that the entertainer drugged and raped them - none of whom have dampened the 'strength of womanhood' in Camille Cosby, her husband said.

Cosby refused to address the allegations in a phone conversation Friday, but did imply his relationship with Camille, who married him fifty years ago, remains intact. 

When asked by the reporter how she was coping he said: 'Love and the strength of womanhood.' 

He then repeated the phrase twice more. 

He has previously said he 'doesn't have to answer to' the rape accusations, which he characterized as 'innuendo'.

He then finished the conversation by saying he had been told not to talk to the media.

Cosby has been under fire from an ever-expanding list of accusers, many of whom have a similar story of being slipped a pill before the comedian, best know for playing Cliff Huxtable on the Cosby Show, assaulted them.

While he has never explicitly denied any accusation, his legal team have hit out against some of his accusers, particularly former supermodel Janice Dickinson, who repeatedly called him a rapist in a televised interview with CNN.

Dickinson also used the appearance to address Cosby's wife - whom she said she pitied for having a rapist husband.

She said: 'I feel bad for her. She knew that he was promiscuous. She stayed married to him. This is her choice, I can't speak for her.

'I can only say to Mrs Cosby that I am sorry I had sex with your husband and he had raped me. I'm sorry that he raped me.

'I'm sorry for you that your husband gave me wine and pills - with the sole intent of having sex with me and raping me.

'I'm sorry for her husband was a philanderer and is rapist, I really mean that, and for his children.'
