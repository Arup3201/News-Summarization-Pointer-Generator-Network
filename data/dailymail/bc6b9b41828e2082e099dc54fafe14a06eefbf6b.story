The Pennsylvania father of two toddlers who died after
 a dresser fell on them was ordered Thursday to stand trial on involuntary manslaughter charges.

David Beatty, of Aliquippa, will also stand trial for child endangerment along with his wife Jennifer in the deaths of 2-year-old Brooklyn and 3-year-old Ryeley. The mother is not charged with manslaughter.

Brooklyn died shortly after the dresser fell on her on July 4, and 
Ryeley died two days later in a Pittsburgh hospital.

Defense attorney Kevin Kindred tried to argue for a dismissal of the charges on Thursday — but a Beaver County judge ordered the couple to stand trial.

The Aliquippa couple, who are both 28, face child endangerment charges for allegedly keeping a filthy home.

Authorities have said the home was in 'deplorable' conditions, including dirty bedclothes and diapers and human and animal waste 
on the floors, walls and beds, authorities said.

Kindred said the
 deaths were accidental and that the home's condition was being 
unfairly linked to the deaths.

Prosecutor Anthony Berosh 
said Beatty was home alone with the girls and acknowledged he didn't 
check on them for 10 to 15 minutes after hearing the crash of a dresser onto the girls, which prevented them from breathing.

The dresser 
weighed 124 pounds —  the girls about 30 pounds each.

An autopsy doctor testified that the little girls could have been saved had David Beatty helped them immediately after hearing the furniture crash on July 4.

Authorities say Beatty gave police 
various accounts of what happened, first telling them that he responded 
to the crash within 'seconds' and that he had left the girls alone to 
play in the room only while he drew them a bath.

'He
 stated that he did not think much about the noise because the kids are 
always jumping off of beds and making noises,' police wrote in a 
criminal complaint.
