Disturbing images of skin-and-bone hens perching on mountains of faeces and crammed into overcrowded cages have been alleged to be from a local NSW farm which supplies its eggs to one of Australia's biggest egg producers.

Pace Farm, Australia's leading supplier, marketer and distributor of eggs and egg products, was fined $3000 for the conditions at the same Corowa facility in May last year, with the farm manager also receiving a $500 fine.

Now, alleged new photographs and video footage from the same farm, anonymously supplied to the national animal protection organisation Animals Australia, show that conditions at the caged-egg providing facility continue to breach multiple animal welfare regulations.

Disturbing new images anonymously supplied to Animals Australia, have revealed the disturbing conditions of a Pace Farm caged-egg facility in Corowa, New South Wales

Animals Australia has lodged a complaint with the RSPCA, claiming that the farm has again crammed more birds into their cages than welfare regulations allow, and that many appear in poor body condition.

The organisation claims the breaches come under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act as well as the Model Code of Practice.

'Dozens of birds, many in poor condition, were discovered abandoned in manure pits below the cages, without access to food or water. The severely de-feathered animals appeared to be surviving on scraps, beetles and eggs,' Lyn White, the campaign director for Animals Australia said.

'That's twice in fourteen months this facility has been found overstocking birds in cages, shows why industry auditing systems cannot be trusted.'

This is despite Pace Farm’s decree on their website, which states: ‘We've invested heavily in developing innovative, state of the art facilities to exceed worldwide standards in flock care, product quality, environmental impact and bio-security.

'Our farms are regularly subject to independent audits to ensure their compliance with national and international accreditation schemes.'

Pace Farms is also a part, Egg Corp Assured, a national egg quality assurance program which sets 'strict guidelines' on a number of issues including 'hen health and welfare', according to its website.

However a spokesperson for Animals Australia, Lisa Chalk, explained that there is a lack of independent oversight of factory farms in Australia, with no government inspection program of factory farms set up in NSW at all.

'This case not only reinforces the cruelty of the battery cage but reveals why independent auditing is desperately needed given the ongoing failure of industry and government to enforce even the most basic standards,' Ms White said.

Due to a lack of government oversight or review of battery cage eggs, Animals Australia and animal protection groups have said the only way consumers can ensure they are not supporting cruelty is by not buying cage eggs.

'Continuing to confine millions of birds this way in Australia is indefensible, especially when other countries have long recognised and acted on this cruelty,' Ms White said.

'You cannot look at these poor hens crammed together and morally justify the lives they are forced to lead. We bring these birds into this world only to suffer. Cage eggs may be cheaper, but it is the birds that are paying a dreadful price.'

Daily Mail Australia have contacted Pace Farm for a comment but are yet to receive a response.
