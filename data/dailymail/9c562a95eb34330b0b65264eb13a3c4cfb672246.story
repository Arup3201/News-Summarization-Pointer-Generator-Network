On the battlefields of the First World War, he showed death-defying bravery and inspired thousands of soldiers.

In the mud and blood of the trenches, he survived bullets, bombs and bayonets as well as twice escaping from burning buildings.

But this war hero was not a serviceman. He was an unflappable steed called Warrior – dubbed ‘the horse the Germans couldn’t kill’.

Yesterday Warrior, who braved machine guns and shells on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916, was posthumously awarded the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross in the conflict’s centenary year. 

The medal was accepted at the Imperial War Museum, at a special ceremony compered by Kate Adie OBE, by author and broadcaster Brough Scott, the grandson of Warrior’s owner General Jack Seely, who would later become Lord Mottistone. 

Warrior was represented by serving Army horse, Irish Draught Charger, Benjamin Buckram, from the The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Woolwich.

It was the first honorary PDSA Dickin Medal to be presented in the charity’s history, and marks Warrior’s courage as well as that shown by all the animals who served on the front line in the First World War.

After arriving on the Western Front on August 11 1914 with Gnrl Seely, Warrior stayed there throughout the war, surviving machine gun attacks and falling shells at the Battle of the Somme.

He was dug out of the mud of Passchendaele and twice trapped under the burning beams of his stables, surviving many charges at the enemy and proving an inspiration to the soldiers he was fighting alongside.

Despite suffering several injuries, Warrior survived and returned home to the Isle of Wight in 1918, where he lived with the Seely family until his death aged 33.

Mr Scott said he accepted the medal with 'great pride and gratitude' on behalf of Warrior and all the 'remarkable' animals in the Great War.

He said: 'Warrior's story - which I grew up hearing at my mothers' knee - was lost in time to the wider world. But now he rides again 100 years later, thanks to PDSA.

'My family and I are more than honoured that Warrior has been given this award on behalf of all animals that also served; we are truly humbled. I only wish Jack Seely were here today to witness Warrior receiving the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross.'

The PDSA Dickin Medal, instituted by the charity's founder Maria Dickin in 1943, is recognised as the highest award an animal can achieve while serving in military conflict.

Warrior's award as the first ever First World War recipient of a medal, and the first honorary award, has been recognised by celebrity supporters including Steven Spielberg, director of the Oscar-nominated film War Horse.

He said: 'Warrior is an extraordinary example of the resilience, strength, and profound contribution that horses made to the Great War. Recognising him with an Honorary PDSA Dickin Medal is a fitting and poignant tribute not only to this remarkable animal, but to all animals that served.'

PDSA director general Jan McLoughlin added: 'Warrior's gallantry and devotion to duty throughout World War One reflects the bravery shown by the millions of horses, dogs, pigeons and other animals engaged in the war.

'That is why he is a worthy recipient of this very special Honorary PDSA Dickin Medal - the first and only of its kind.

'And in this anniversary year of remembrance there can surely be no more fitting way to honour the bravery and sacrifice that millions of noble animals displayed during World War One.'

Throughout the incident his behaviour was of the highest order, although the blast was capable of making a hole over a foot in diameter in a steel plate.'

Gina Koutsika, head of national and international programmes and projects at IWM, said: 'Over 16 million animals served in the First World War.

'They were used for transport, communication and companionship. Our love for animals is something that will never change and many members of the First World War Centenary Partnership are reflecting this in their programming.

'By honouring Warrior in the centenary year, PDSA have brought to the forefront the story of all animals.'

Since its introduction, 65 Dickin Medals have been awarded - to 29 dogs, 32 Second World War messenger pigeons, three horses (not including Warrior) and one cat.

The last recipient was Military Working Dog Sasha, who died while on patrol in Afghanistan, who was given the award posthumously in May this year.
