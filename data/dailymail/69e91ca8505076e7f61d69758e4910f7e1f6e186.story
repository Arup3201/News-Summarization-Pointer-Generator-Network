A nameless soldier who became an emblem of the bravery and suffering of British soldiers sent to die in the brutal Battle of the Somme may finally have been identified.

The young man, who was captured on film carrying the body of a wounded comrade on his soldiers, featured in a 1916 film which showed thousands the true horrors of the First World War for the first time.

He was widely suspected to have died during the war, but a striking photograph has emerged of an army private - Frederick Darkes - who could have been the mysterious figure, and in fact lived until the 1960s.

Suffering: The 1916 film, The Battle of the Somme, showed many the horrors of war for the first time

Similarities: The two images, digitally combined above, show a similarity between the soldier from the film (left) and a later photograph of Private Frederick Darkes - whose surviving family believe that he was the man from the footage

The 77-minute footage - released to the 
public under the title The Battle of the Somme - showed shocking images 
of the front lines, including the mud-splattered trenches and images of 
wounded men.

The film was an unprecedented success. Around 20million people are thought to have seen it within six weeks of its release, and although many found the vivid images of war disturbing, seeing British soldiers in action provided a massive boost in support for the war.

However, the man featured bearing his fellow soldier on his back wore no identifying 
information - and the producers of the film did not keep any records of 
who appeared in it. The only note accompanying the scene says that the 
wounded man died half an hour after the footage was taken.

But now the mystery could have been solved after claims emerged that the son of a stretcher bearer who served in the battle says that he recognises his father from the footage. 

Potential match: This photograph shows Private Darkes with his wife after the war, and bears a resemblance to the figure in the 1916 footage

According to 83-year-old Raymond 
Darkes, the mysterious and heroic figure is in fact Private Frederick 
Darkes, a member of the 11th Battalion Royal Warwickshire Regiment.

A
 comparison between images from the footage and a later photograph of 
Private Darkes are strikingly similar - and now the Darkes family are 
seeking help from experts at the Imperial War Museum to see whether the 
identity can be confirmed after 98 years.

Paul Darkes, Private Darkes's grandson, said: 'We have papers to prove that granddad was in France, and we can prove he got discharged in 1917, after he lost the use of in one arm.

'My dad always says "I know my own father" and he is happy with that, but to have it confirmed would be marvellous for him.

'The War Office say that his regiment was in that area at the time - I believe there are face recognition techniques that are available today.

As the centenary of the First World War approaches, Private Darkes is not the possible match for the nameless soldier.

Just weeks ago it was suggested that Tom Wright, a stretcher bearer in the Royal Army Medical Corps, could be the man.

His son Edward Wright told the Scarborough News: 'When I saw the picture on the television I immediately thought "that’s my dad."

'I am appealing to anyone who has the expertise to help us -we have an old photo of granddad and if anyone could help by comparing the two photographs, I would be delighted.'

The footage is used in The Battle of the Somme, a 1916 British documentary and propaganda film, depicting the British Army in the preliminary and early days of the great battle.

Generals hoped would prove decisive in breaking through the German lines, but turned out to be one of the greatest disasters in British military history.

Mr Darkes Snr said: 'I first saw dad’s picture in a war programme I was watching about ten years ago. I just thought: "That’s my dad!", but I couldn’t get a video in quick enough to record it.

'Dad was born on November 19, 1888. He joined the Army in 1914 and died in 1960.

'He never mentioned the war much. He was wounded - he got blown up and lay half-buried in mud for three days until he was discovered.

'His arm was badly injured, but they said that he was saved from bleeding to death by the mud that congealed over the wound.

'They saved his arm, but it was never much use to him after that. He always worked though. He always said that the Government promised them each an acre of land and a cow - but it never happened.'

However, a spokesman from the Imperial War Museum said it has yet to be convinced by any claims to have solved the mystery.

A spokesman said: 'We have never been able formally to confirm any of the suggestions made to us of the identity of the soldier in the photograph and as far as we are concerned, the question remains officially open.

'It appears that there were three men who carried the wounded soldier – the man who approaches the camera was seemingly the third soldier to bear the strain of a fallen comrade.

'Geoffrey Malins, the cameraman who filmed the scene later described how “a trench mortar man” and another volunteer made the rescue, but does not say which of them actually carried the wounded man in; neither does he provide a name for either of them.

'There are no official records that we have so far been able to trace which offer any more detail than this unofficial account.

'Malins is known to have been filming in the early morning of 1 July in the sector of the front line occupied by the 1st Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, part of 29th Division, facing German positions at Beaumont Hamel. It is generally assumed that this was also filmed in or close to the same location.'

As the footage of The Battle of the Somme was prepared to be shown around Britain - just four weeks after it was filmed on the battlefield.

It was a huge success, and 20million people had flocked to cinemas to see the footage just six weeks after it was released. A single film would not reach so many viewers again until Star Wars in 1977.

Photographs and descriptions of life on the front had been available previously, but this was the first time a moving picture of modern warfare was widely shown. Many audience members would never have seen a film before.

At first was feared that the graphic depiction of war might damage morale, but instead the images of brave British soldiers struggling on the front line brought about a huge swell of support.

A newspaper report at the time says: 'Crowded audiences ... were interested and thrilled to have the realities of war brought so vividly before them, and if women had sometimes to shut their eyes to escape for a moment from the tragedy of the toll of battle which the film presents, opinion seems to be general that it was wise that the people at home should have this glimpse of what our soldiers are doing and daring and suffering in Picardy.'
