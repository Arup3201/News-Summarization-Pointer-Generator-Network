The Seven Network's siege special, to be aired on Sunday night, will show the harrowing moment where gunman Man Monis raises his gun to shoot Lindt cafe manager Tori Johnson in the head.

It's believed the vision does not, however, show the fatal discharge but Daily Mail Australia has been told that 'you hear the shot'.

Seven will show 'Inside The Siege: The Untold Story' in the normal 6pm news slot on Sunday and it is expected to run at least 90 minutes. That means it will clash, at some point, with the Nine Network's 60 Minutes siege special, which is scheduled to start at 7pm.

The Daily Mail has learned that in the next sequence, Monis can be clearly seen fumbling with his gun, after shooting Mr Johnson, trying to reload as police then storm the building.

Seven had three cameras locked on the Lindt cafe, providing producers more than 50 hours of vision sift through for Sunday night's special

In the vision to be seen for the first time on Sunday, Monis is clearly seen walking with two human shields to investigate noises at the back of the building. That is the moment when five hostages run free and he forces the manager to kneel, then takes aim.

An industry insider told DMA that 'they (Seven) will be able to illustrate the narrative of all the hostages' stories'.

'When the siege happened, they had it from the very start, they have the first cameras on the scene and almost from the word go there’s a record of what took place.'

Seven's production team sifted through about 50 hours of vision from three different cameras which were trained on the Lindt cafe, across Martin Place from the network's newsroom.

It's understood, one was focused wide, one was roaming and another which had a magnified lens, gave police sniper's a full-on close-up of Monis.

'They'll have every second of those 16 plus hours, it'll be difficult to know what to leave out.'

It will be presented by Melissa Doyle, who undertook the interviews, along with Mark Ferguson.

60 Minutes will air its siege special at 7pm Sunday with eight survivors featured, including Joel Herat (pictured) who is seen in this image being forced to place the Islamic Shahada flag in the Lindt cafe window

The special will also reveal how Monis had all the mobile phones collected and placed on a table. No one was allowed to have them 'for fear of death', except for the opportunity to contact loved ones and say goodbye and to record video messages, as ordered by the gunman.

Monis held 18 hostages for almost 17 hours from 9.45am on Monday December 15, until police stormed the cafe just after 2.10am the next morning.

As yet, no decision has been made by the Lindt company as to the future of the cafe in Martin Place. 

Marcia Mikhael was one of the first to agree to tell her story, reportedly rejecting a $300,000 offer from the Nine Network to be a part of the Seven special

Marcia Mikhael, 43, was one of the first to agree to an exclusive interview with Seven, which is thought to have paid between $350,000 and $400,000 for her story - after the Nine Network tabled at $300,000 offer which was rejected.

She tells Doyle, the former Sunrise host, that Monis warned:  "For every person that escapes I will shoot two", that's when I lost hope. Then I asked them if I could call my kids and speak to them because I actually wanted to hear their voices for the last time.'

A decision on the Lindt cafe's future in Martin Place is expected to be made soon

Both Channel Seven and Channel Nine have secured exclusive interviews with several of the survivors, with the cost for the networks believed to nudge $1 million.

The networks were so desperate to snare the best stories for their head-to-head broadcasts, they were sending out their stars to 'door knock' the 16 survivors to convince them to tell-all.

Seven will feature the stories of six survivors - Marcia Mikhael, John O'Brien, Viswakanth Ankireddy, Puspendu Ghosh, Elly Chen and Jieun Bae.

60 Minutes has announced its special will focus on the accounts of eight survivors, telling of their horror inside the cafe - Paolo Vassallo, Harriette Denny, Joel Herat, Jarrod Morton-Hoffman, Fiona Ma, Selina Win Pe and Louisa and Robin Hope.

It's also been revealed that both networks are racing against the clock to have the specials finished, just five days out from going to air.
