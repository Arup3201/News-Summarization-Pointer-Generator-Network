Touts have scammed football fans out of hundreds of pounds by passing off free tickets for a Hillsborough disaster memorial service as tickets for a game between Liverpool and Swansea.

The tickets were tampered with to make them look like they granted entry for last Sunday's fixture and sold for up to £100.

But fans were left disappointed when they found they had actually been sold free tickets issued for a memorial service to mark the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 people died.

Fans at last year's service mark the 24th anniversary of the disaster. Tickets are free to fans through Liverpool Football Club for this year's memorial at Anfield

Hillsborough Justice Campaign's Steve Kelly, who was at Sunday's match and was told of the scam by stewards, said it 'beggars belief'.

He said: 'The fact it was the anniversary tickets just goes to show how low some people will go.'

A Liverpool FC spokesman told the BBC: 'It was disgraceful anyone would 
consider using the tickets allocated to those who wish to attend a 
memorial service to remember the 96 Liverpool supporters who so 
tragically lost their lives at Hillsborough, for illegal gain.

'Supporters should only buy tickets through official channels and we 
regularly remind fans about the dangers of purchasing from touts and 
others.

'The technology deployed at our turnstiles will refuse entry to anyone without an official ticket.'

The service will be held at 2.15pm on April 15 to mark the 1989 tragedy.

Free tickets are available from the club until March 31.

Genuine: Fans had hoped to purchase a real ticket to the game, like the one pictured above

New inquests into the death of the fans killed in the crush at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium during Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest are due to start in Warrington on March 31 and will take six months to complete.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission is also examining accounts of the tragedy made by police amid suspicion that they were later amended.

A spokesperson for Liverpool FC described the scam as 'a disgrace' and urged fans to buy tickets directly
