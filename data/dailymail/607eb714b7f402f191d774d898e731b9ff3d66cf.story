A senior police chief has been removed from his post while claims of his 'inappropriate behaviour' are investigated.

Chief Superintendent Darren Williams, Merton Borough Commander in south west London, was suspended yesterday after complaints were brought against him by colleagues.

The 47-year-old father of two, a keen boxer, has served with the police force for 26 years and been based in Merton since February 2012.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said today: 'We can confirm that the borough commander of Merton Borough has been suspended from duty on January 7 2014 following the receipt of complaints relating to his conduct.

'This conduct is now under investigation by the directorate of professional standards. The matters were raised by MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) employees, and relate to inappropriate behaviour.'

The spokesman said they would not say anything further that might identify the members of police staff who made the complaints.

While Ch Supt Williams is suspended, Superintendent David Palmer will act as the borough commander for Merton until the investigation is concluded.

The Met spokesman added: 'The MPS expects all officers and staff to maintain the highest standards of conduct. Where they fall short of this standard we will take the most appropriate action.'

Ch Supt Williams, who was in the Army before joining the police, writes a weekly letter to the people of his borough in which he tells residents about fitness challenges he does for cancer and servicemen's charities.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said Ch Supt Williams was suspended yesterday after complaints were made

In his most recent newsletter, published yesterday, he summed up the year in his police borough and wrote at the end: 'Thank you for all your support during 2013 - I know you all think that I am far too cheesy already but it is a huge honour to be your Borough Commander - I really do believe that I have the best job in the best police service in the world.'

In 2012 Ch Supt Williams took part in a fund-raising boxing match against heavyweight champion Tim Witherspoon.

Ch Supt Williams was previously Deputy Borough Commander at Bexley, in Kent, before which he led the Metâ€™s pan-London crime squad, specialising in hate crime and public protection.

He was in charge at Merton last year when his colleague, PC Andrew Duncan, was run down and killed in September when he tried to stop a speeding driver.

Local officers were also involved in dealing with record crowds coming to watch the Wimbledon tennis championships, won by Andy Murray.
