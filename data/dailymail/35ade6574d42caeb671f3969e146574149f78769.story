Worn in a dishevelled, boho way all summer, the oversized topknot was the go-to hairdo for relaxed sunny days.

But with the Christmas party season in full swing, the topknot is due a sophisticated, polished update.

Elegant actress Marion Cotillard rocked this look at the Christian Dior party in Marrakech last week.

And with the voluminous style showing no signs of falling out of fashion, celebrity hairdresser Mark Woolley guarantees it will be the most glamorous way to keep your hair tidy all night this Christmas.

Here, in FEMAIL's exclusive step-by-step guide, Mark styles MailOnline writer Sara with a party topknot using a bun hairpiece.Scroll down for video

Mark Woolley guarantees the voluminous topknot will be the most glamorous way to keep your hair tidy

Mark explains that the pre-prepared topknots is used for red carpet looks all the time

The first step in creating this red carpet look is backcombing the hair at the crown of the head. This step is key, as it created cushioning and support for the hair piece.

Backcomb right to the ends and round the front as well as the back of the hair. Once that's done, pin it in place with kirby grips.

Backcomb the roots of the surrounding area for further support.

Mark says the key to this look is backcombing the top section which supports the hair piece

For cushioning, backcomb to the ends, from all sides and pin. Then, backcomb the roots of the surrounding hair

Next we need to decide how much of the hair we're leaving out - in Sara's case the sweeping fringe - and part it accordingly.

The sweeping fringe is a great alternative for ladies who find scraping all the hair away from their face too severe and prefer to leave something to frame their features. Also, those who have a fringe already can leave that down. Otherwise you can opt for Marion's look for the fashionista edge.

Clip any hair you're leaving down out of the way and backcomb the roots of the rest of the hair. Pin it up as you go.

Mark decides how much to leave out at the front - here, the sweeping fringe - and backcombs the rest

Now we attach the hair piece - here we're using the Beauty Works Â£29.99 Beehive Messy Bun in colour 33, a Mahogany shade.

It's great because it's an exact colour match to Sara's natural hair - and it has clever grips hidden on the inside,

Use plenty of kirby grips to secure in - the last thing we want is the piece to fall out. I'm making sure Sara can party all night.

Next is putting the hairpiece on - it's great as it has grips on

Mark says for red carpet looks kirby grips tend to help out hairdressers a lot - he uses plenty for this look

Take the first piece of the remaining hair and start to pin it in around the hairpiece. Begin with one section from each side, first left, then right, and wrap round on opposite sides for a twist effect

It's really nice to blend the natural hair with the hair form the hair piece.

Spray with hairspray to secure as you go.

What's nice - and what makes this twist and topknot look editorial and red carpet - is the hair has a really natural movement feel to it.

Mark brushes the hair, pulls it section by section around the bun and secures, noting the brilliant colour match

The twist and topknot, despite being very secure, has a really nice natural movement feel to it

Sara loves this look - something she can create at home and still look like she's going on the red carpet
