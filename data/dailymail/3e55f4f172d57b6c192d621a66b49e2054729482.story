A pub has apologised after a barman refused to serve a group of local election campaigners because they supported Ukip.

Stonegate Pubs have also offered a free meal to the stunned half dozen at the Rectory in Purley, south London, after a member of staff called them 'disgusting'.

Local candidate Georgina Guillem was campaigning with Kathleen Garner and four supporters in the run up to Mayâ€™s local elections, when they decided to have a drink.

The group, five aged over-65 and one man in his 30s, took off their rosettes and packed their stuff away before going inside the high street pub.

Ms Garner said: 'Georgina walked up to the bar to get some drinks and he just said, "You are Ukip, you are disgusting", and refused to serve her.

'I could not believe it and went up to the bar and he said to me again "you are disgusting".

'It is the thought police and even if it is legal, it is certainly not an acceptable way to behave. You should certainly not be able to discriminate against people on grounds of their politics.

'The way you think is the way you think and life is going to become very unpleasant if people are going to discriminate against you for that.

'And it is not even how you think - but the way others think you think.'

She complained to Stonegate Pubs, which last week offered an apology and a free meal.

A Stonegate spokesman said an investigation had taken place and added: 'We would like to make clear the company has no affiliations to any political party.'

He added that the member of staff was disciplined. Ms Guillem polled just 552 votes in the local vote and came third.
