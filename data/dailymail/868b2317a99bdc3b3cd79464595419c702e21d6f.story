Hillary Clinton has said that she will make sleep, exercise and relaxing her priorities over the coming year. But the promise of some down-time seems to have already had a positive effect as she bids farewell to her four-year term as Secretary of State.

Mrs Clinton, 65, looked on fine form in Myanmar today as she joined President Obama in a historic meeting with the country's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Though she looked elegant and polished in a crisp 
white blazer, navy pants and a statement silver beaded neckpiece, it 
was the broad smile she wore that really made the difference.

Mrs Clinton, who greeted the iconic 
pro-democracy leader with a warm hug, seemed happier and healthier than 
she has in some time.

It made for a stark contrast with 
some previous public appearances, in which the demands of the role 
appear to have taken a more visible toll.

Indeed, who could blame her. In four years, she logged more 
than 918,000 miles, traveling to 112 countries - overseas for nearly a 
quarter of her time in office.

Longstanding friendship: Mrs Clinton and Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi have met on several occasions before, and greeted each other with a warm hug

And, one might add, thank goodness 
Mrs Clinton's priorities lay with the issues at hand, rather than her 
shut-eye schedule - though she is the first to admit that a good rest is
 long overdue.

In an interview with  The New York Times last week, she refused to be drawn on rumors that she is planning to run for President in 2016.

She admitted: 'I
 just want to sleep and exercise and travel for fun. And relax. It 
sounds so ordinary, but I haven’t done it for 20 years. I would like to 
see whether I can get untired.

'I work out and stuff, but I don’t do it 
enough and I don’t do it hard enough because I can’t expend that much 
energy on it.'

Toll: Mrs Clinton, seen in Nov 2008, was fresher- faced before she became Secretary of State

She added that she had not yet decided what will follow the year-long hiatus from public life, joking, 'maybe I'll get a decorating show.'

Mrs Clinton's visit to Myanmar with President Obama marked the  first American presidential visit the controversial country.

Aung San Suu Kyi, who endured two decades under house arrest in her struggle for a 
free and democratic Burma, greeted the pair warmly outside her home.

The meeting is diplomatically important as it sends a 
clear signal that America supports her cause.

Now a member of parliament, Suu Kyi lives in a gated residence with razor wire along the top of the compound walls.

She was detained in the house, about six miles north of downtown 
Yangon, from 1989 until her most recent release in November 2010.
