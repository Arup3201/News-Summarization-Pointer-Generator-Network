A robotic multi-camera system has been developed in Japan that can record a single scene simultaneously from multiple angles.

A computer can then stitch the individual images together to create a video clip of that scene, which can sped up or slowed down.

The effect the system creates is called 'bullet time' and is the same effect used in 1999 film The Matrix in which the main character Neo is shown dodging bullets in slow motion as a camera virtually moves the audience 360-degrees around the shot.

NHK's system uses eight cameras, each one used for various pans, tilts and zooms. These eight cameras move in tandem with one main camera that can be moved around the action. Each of the remote-controlled 'Hi-Vision' HDTV cameras is equipped with two motors for left-right pans, up-down tilts and zooms. As the main camera moves, the eight cameras follow the action with it, pointed at different angles

This image shows NHK's system in use at a volleyball match. The cameras are all directed at the back of the player making a spike. The images from each camera can be quickly displayed in a sequence giving viewers an all-round view of the player

Bullet Time is also known as frozen time, the big freeze, dead time, flow motion, or time slice.

It is a special and visual effect that refers to a digitally enhanced simulation of variable-speeds, such as  slow motion and time-lapse photography.

It is used in films, adverts and video games.

Bullet Time slows the images down but also changes the camera angle by moving around the scene changing the audience's point of view.

This isn't possible with traditional cameras because the cameras would have move round a scene at the same speed at which the event is taking place. 

This makes it impossible. 

The term 'bullet time' is a registered trademark of Warner Bros who first used it in March 2005 in the video game The Matrix Online.

It was also used to promote the 1999 The Matrix film.

The technology has been built by Japan's national broadcaster NHK.

NHK's system uses eight cameras, each one used for various pans, tilts and zooms.

These eight cameras move in tandem with one main camera that can be moved around the action.

Each of the remote-controlled 'Hi-Vision' HDTV cameras is equipped with 
two motors for left-right pans, up-down tilts and zooms.

As the main camera moves, the eight cameras follow the action with it, pointed at different angles.

This lets the cameras keep up with quickly moving players and provide multi-view imaging of the same event.

This
 makes it possible for a single cameraman to operate all of the cameras 
and have them all pointing at the same moving object.

The
 images are then automatically stitched together into video feeds and 
can be used within minutes for analysis during live sporting events.

The broadcaster plans to trial the 
camera set-up during sports matches to check for fouls and when balls 
leave the court or pitch, for example.

The
 system could also be used as an alternative to the Hawk Eye system that
 can slow down images during sports matches for analysis and refereeing 
decisions.

NHK's system is similar to the set-up used by the Wachowski brothers during the filming of their 1999 film The Matrix.

Various scenes in the film are shown in slow-motion and the camera pans around a single shot.

The most famous of these images include when the main character Neo dodges a flying bullet and stops bullets in mid air.

This led to the term 'bullet time' being coined and trademarked by Warner Bros, the film's distributor.

A computer then stitches the images together to make a video that can recreate slow-motion, multi-angled clips.

The technique of using a group of still cameras to freeze motion dates back to 19th-century experiments by Eadweard Muybridge. He used a line of cameras to record a galloping horse

Multi-view imaging involves surrounding the objects, such as sports players, with a number of cameras.

These cameras can provide a virtual all-round view of the object at any one time.

Traditional cameras and systems can only capture objects from a limited number of viewpoints.

To capture the full 360-degree view, 
the cameras would have to travel around the object at the same speed at 
which the event happens which is impossible and would blur any images 
created.

NHK designed the system to reduce the size of remote-controlled cameras currently used and speed up the capturing process.

They showcased it at the NHK Science and Technology Research Labs Open House at the start of June.

The technique of using a group of still cameras to freeze motion dates back to 19th-century experiments by Eadweard Muybridge.

He used a line of cameras to record a galloping horse.

Muybridge placed still cameras along a racetrack and each camera was attached to a piece of string stretched across the track.

As the horse galloped passed the camera shutters snapped taking one frame of the galloping horse at a time.

Unforgettable sporting moments, such as David Beckham's goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon in 1996 (video below), could be enhanced by the new technology
