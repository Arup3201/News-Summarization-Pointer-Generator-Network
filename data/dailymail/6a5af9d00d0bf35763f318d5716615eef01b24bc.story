They may be being judged on their skiing skills but there's no doubt the female stars on this season of The Jump will be competitive in the glamour stakes, too.

Made In Chelsea star Louise Thompson is gearing up to go head-to-head with selfie superfan Chloe Madeley, supermodel Jodie Kidd and former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts on the show.

What will no doubt help Louise is the £1,000 of beauty treatments, including a a fat-freezing beauty treatment to tone her thighs that she revealed she had.

The 23-year-old Edinburgh University graduate had a 90-minute Lipoglaze treatment on her inner thighs in her strive for a 'thigh gap'. 

Louise appeared on the show this week looking svelte and slender for her photocall in the mountains in Innsbruck, Austria, alongside other female contestants including Stacey Solomon, Louise Hazel, Heather Mills and Lady Victoria Hervey.

Ironically, given that she will be spending the next few weeks in sub-zero temperatures, the treatment that she had back in 2013 worked by freezing her fatty tissues down to minus eight degrees.

At that temperature, fat cells apparently crystallise and die and then waste away naturally. One 60-minute treatment claims to reduce fat by up to 33 per cent and results can start to show after a week and will be complete by around eight weeks, claims the company.

Prices for the lipoglaze treatment at the LoveLite clinic in Harley Street start at £600 but go up to £800 for a 45-minute procedure on two treatment areas, like Louise had on both thighs.

She also visited a celebrity facialist last year, who recommended she try out a £185 facial to reduce fine lines

Strictly Come Dancing star Kristina Rihanoff, Apprentice runner-up Luisa Zissman and TOWIE’s Tom Pearce have also trialled the treatment.

Louise wasn't stopping at just the fat freezing; she also opted to have a series of 60-minute anti-ageing Skinbreeze facials.

She visited celebrity facialist Debbie Thomas in Knightsbridge, who recommended she try out the £185 facial to reduce fine lines and plump skin. 

Louise is certainly keen to get stuck into the show and recently joked, 'Love getting to the mountain before the lifts are open.' 

Other famous faces joining her on the piste will be Gogglebox's resident posh tippler Dom Parker, Zara Phillips' rugby star husband Mike Tindall, Jackass star Steve-O and former JLS singer JB Gill.

The 16 contestants have already begun training and will have to tackle events such as bobsleigh, slalom and ski cross.

But before even landing a place in the contest, they must complete a skeleton run, with the fastest racers directly qualifying while the others will be involved in a live ski jump.

Those who achieve the shortest distances will have to sit out as substitutes. 

The treatment pumps serum deep into the lower layers of the skin, plumping and smoothing any lines in the skin as well as promoting hydration

 An earlier version of this article stated that Louise Thompson had the beauty treatment ahead of her appearance on TV programme The Jump because she was self-conscious about her appearance and in the hope that she would look toned and slim in the skin-tight Lycra jumpsuit she would be hearing on the show. We are happy to clarify that Ms Thompson had the treatment over a year ago and long before she knew she would be engaged on the TV programme.
