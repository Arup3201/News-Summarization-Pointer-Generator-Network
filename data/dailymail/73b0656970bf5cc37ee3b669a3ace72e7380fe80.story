A company based in Paris has released a ‘smart’ e-cigarette that they say can predict a user's life expectancy.

The Smokio device connects to a smartphone app and tracks your usage, giving the user updates on both their health and finances over time.

The company says the device will not only save smokers money, but it’ll also help them give up on real cigarettes.

The Smokio e-cigarette, shown, claims to be able to increase a person's life expectancy by monitoring their 'vaping' usage while using the device. It links to a smartphone app and gives a user information on how their health would differ if they had continued smoking regular cigarettes

Inside the Smokio e-cigarette is a small microchip that transmits data to an app available for both Android and iOS.

E-cigarettes could save millions of lives and should not be classed as a tobacco product, which would restrict their access, leading health experts have warned.

Last week more than 50 researchers and specialists published a letter after claiming to have seen a leaked document from the World Health Organisation (WHO) which labelled the e-cigarettes as a 'threat'.

The letter urges health officials to consider the health consequences of such a move, amid fears e-cigarettes will become harder to obtain.

But critics say that not enough is known about the long-term effects of the devices, which deliver nicotine in a vapour.

The e-cigarette is linked to a smartphone by Bluetooth in order to transfer information.

Users can then view statistics over the last 30 days to see what their vaping - the term given to breathing nicotine-infused e-cigarette liquid - habits are.

The device costs €80 (£65; $80) and includes a 900 mAh battery, which can hold about seven hours of charge.

The electronic 'brain' of the device lets a user track usage and check their vaping history.

When they smoke it monitors their usage and trends, telling them when and where they've vaped using GPS technology.

It also shows users the equivalent consumption that would be smoked with cigarettes.

The app then reveals to a smoker how their health would differ if they had continued smoking.

This includes things such as blood oxygenation levels, taste and smell, lung capacity and heart rejuvenation.

Through this information the app then estimates how many days the user has added to their life expectancy.

‘This is based on data taken from the American Cancer Society,’ Johan Collet of Smokio explains to MailOnline.

‘This takes into account your age and how much you smoke. It’s a catalyst taking into account all of the things that will improve your health.’

This then gives an estimate for how many extra days a smoker is adding to their life expectancy by switching tobacco for vaping.

‘The Bluetooth microchip in the battery collects data from when you take a puff,’ continues Collet.

‘This includes the time of the puff, intensity of the puff and all things like that.

‘It then stores and transmits it to your smartphone where calculations are performed and spit out in more readable form.’

The
 effects of e-cigarettes are still largely unknown, with various 
agencies such as the US Food and Drug administration currently 
performing studies.

A
 study in the journal Addiction last month, however, found that 20 per 
cent of nearly 6,000 smokers quit smoking with the help of e-cigarettes.

The accompanying Smokio app gives a user information from the past 30 days (middle). This includes information on when and where they've used the device (left) and their health (right), such as the change in blood oxygenation levels and heart rejuvenation, although the data is not gathered by measuring vital signs
