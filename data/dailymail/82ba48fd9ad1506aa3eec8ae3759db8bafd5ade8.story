This is the moment a shameless shopper agrees to go out with a man she previously turned down for lunch after promised she'll meet David Beckham if she comes along. 

Browsing jewellery in a shop window in Hitchin Market Square, Hertfordshire, the woman curtly turns down prankster Paul Klein when he asks her to join he and a group of friends for a meal. 

Asked whether she'll take a photograph of the man and his comedy sidekick, Paul Woods, she takes the latter's iPhone into her hands.

Paul Wood and Paul Klein approach the woman as she browses jewellery in a shop window in Hitchin 

After being turned down, the men ask the woman to take a picture of them using one of their mobile phones

When 'David Beckham' phones, the woman bashfully hands the phone back. Within minutes, she tells the pair that she's changed her mind, on the basis that she would 'love to meet' the former footballer and his family. 

The encounter, a 'social experiment' by Woody and Kleiny as they call themselves, was filmed from afar and shared on YouTube. 

'We wanted to see what would happen once she thought there was a celebrity involved. We'd already done a similar experiment called The Wag Experiment,' said Mr Klein, 23. 

'We approached a lady and I asked her on a date. She said no, but when Woody approached me pretending I was a famous footballer and asked for a selfie with me she quickly changed her mind.

'The whole idea was to have a bit of a laugh, but ultimately we wanted to send out a moral message saying you should get to know people and not just because of who their friends are.

When 'David Beckham' flashes on the phone, Mr Woods makes a quiet exit, leaving the woman in shock that the pair may be friends with the former footballer

The woman quickly changes her mind, telling the men she'd 'love' to meet the Beckham family and begins walking towards the hidden camera

Unable to keep their cool, the pair reveal the encounter has been filmed as part of a prank and that, to her disappointment, the woman will not be meeting David Beckham afterall

'It was really hard to act natural when we filmed the video. Obviously it's a bit far fetched to have David Beckham call you so we had to pay attention to detail in coming across as convincing as possible.

Pranksters: Paul Wood and Paul Klein said they hoped to start a career in television

'Woody was on the phone in the background pretending to chat to him while dropping hints, like mentioning "Vicky" and "Brooklyn". 

'All of a sudden this woman said she wanted to come with us to meet him.

'We were going to string it out longer, but I started laughing and it got the better of us.

'We had to tell her then - luckily she saw the funny side but didn't want her face revealing.' 

Since being posted on YouTube on Tuesday, the video has amassed thousands of comments and likes. 

The pranksters, who appeared on Britain's Got Talent as football experts, say they hope the clips will propel them into a career in television presenting.

'We've been doing these videos since September and this is what we're currently doing full time. 'The plan is to be the next Ant and Dec - we see ourselves more as presenters than pranksters,' said Mr Wood, 24. 

'We created this Youtube channel to build a profile for ourselves online. 

'We're hoping it will snowball by the end of the year - we already have 5,000 subscribers but hoping we can soon reach the 10k mark.'
