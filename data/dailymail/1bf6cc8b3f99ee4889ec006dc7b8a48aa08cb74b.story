New details have emerged about the final hours of President Kennedy’s life, including that he had sex with wife Jackie on Air Force One the day before his assassination 50 years ago.

The information was divulged to historian William Manchester by Jackie Kennedy when he interviewed her in 1964.

In his 1967 book, The Death Of A President, Manchester discretely referred to the intimacy as a ‘last hour of serenity,’ but he had always vowed not to divulge any further details while he was alive.

New details have emerged about the final hours of President Kennedy¿s life, including that he had sex with wife Jackie on Air Force One the day before his assassination 50 years ago

The information has been made public now – the 50th anniversary of Kennedy’s assassination – by writer Philip Nobile who told the New York Post that Manchester had told him in the mid-1970s when he was researching an as-yet-unpublished book about JFK’s reputation as a Casanova.

The two writers had met to discuss Kennedy in the mid-1970s when they both shared the same literary agent.

Manchester told Nobile that Jackie had revealed to him that she and her husband had made love for the last time on Air Force One during the short flight from San Antonio to Houston on the afternoon of November 21, 1963, the day before her husband's assassination.

Manchester admitted that in order to include the sensitive material in his own book, he had used euphemisms and avoided being explicit about what he knew.

In his 1967 book, Manchester wrote: ‘Their life together now had nearly a full day to run. Yet this was to be their last hour of serenity. The tyranny of events and exhaustion would begin to close in when they finished the two-hundred-mile lap to Houston.

‘Actually, they hadn’t even an hour. In this plane the hop took only forty-five minutes. Privacy was that limited, confined to a tiny blue cabin racing 30,000 feet above the tessellated green and brown plains of central Texas . . . Their time was up. The President emerged in a fresh shirt.’

Manchester asked Nobile not to attribute the intimate information to him, at least not while he was alive. The historian died in 2004.

In spite of Manchester’s attempts to appease Jackie, she still strongly objected to several passages in The Death Of A President, calling them ‘tasteless and distorted.’

She sued him for breach of contract in 1966 and she and Bobby Kennedy gained final text approval of his book as part of the settlement.

Manchester also agreed to lock up all research materials due to Jackie’s objections and return 10 hours of taped interviews to be sealed at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.

According to the legal settlement, the judgment remains 'in full force and effect until the expiration of 100 years' and so the public won’t see them until 2067.
