George Zimmerman has fleed Miami after being chased by a crowd and told there is a $10,000 bounty on his head.

He abandoned his home with his family moments after a TV interview with CNN the next morning.

Zimmerman, 30, appeared on CNN on Monday to accuse President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder of making him a 'scapegoat'.

It has emerged his words came hours after infuriated protesters ambushed him, his girlfriend and her son on the beach.

Scapegoat: George Zimmerman, pictured Monday, has accused President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder of making him a 'scapegoat'

Speaking on national television to Chris Cuomo, he revealed he still receives death threats seven months after he was acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin.

He said he suffered a 
'miscarriage of justice' in his trial for the killing of the Florida teen, and maintains that he acted in self-defense within the law.

When Cuomo asked him what he was being made a scapegoat for, he 
responded: 'The government, the president, the attorney general.

'I don’t know what they're thinking 
or why they're thinking it, all I know is that they're doing it. I don't
 know what agenda they have.'

Zimmerman,
 30, also told Cuomo he wants to go back to school and get a law degree 
so he said he can make sure no one else goes through what he did.

'I would like to professionally continue my education and hopefully become an attorney,' Zimmerman said.

'I
 think that's the best way to stop the miscarriage of justice that 
happened to me from happening to somebody else. I don't think it should 
happen to anyone ever again, not one person.'

Zimmerman, who has remained a fixture
 in news headlines, said he still gets death threats following his 
intensely controversial acquittal in the Martin case.

'I
 have a lot of people saying that, you know, they guarantee that they're
 going to kill me and I'll never be a free man,' he told Cuomo. 'I 
realize that they don't know me. They know who I was portrayed to be.'

He
 also said he's often accused of being racist, but said he was raised by
 Peruvian family members and that some of his family are black.

He said he'd never stop trying to fight the accusation that he's 'the guy who gets away with killing a black kid.'

'If
 it takes one person a day at a time to help them realize that's not 
what this case was about then that's what I'll do,' Zimmerman said.

The comments come just days after he claimed he is suffering from post-traumatic stress and is homeless after his trial.

'Sad. Very sad': How George Zimmerman described himself in the recent interview with Ilia Calderón

Insight: Zimmerman told Calderón that he receives death threats due to bad media coverage, not the fact that he shot Trayvon Martin

Zimmerman made the claims to 
journalist Ilia Calderón, who interviewed him for the Spanish language 
current affairs show Aqui y Ahora that aired on Univision on Sunday at 
7pm.

During the 
interview, Zimmerman also claimed that Martin threatened to kill him 
before he shot and killed the unarmed 17-year-old.

'When
 he saw my handgun and looked at it and told me that he was going to 
kill me that night, uh, that was enough of a threat after the way he had
 attacked me. So, I felt his hand going for my weapon,' Zimmerman said.

When asked how he feels now, Zimmerman responded 'Sad. Very sad.'

He told Calderón that after shooting Martin, his main concern was that he had missed his target.

'I was afraid it had gone through his clothes and that it was going to go... get lost, and, um, you know, go into a house and - because the young man was still talking to me, as I have said. So I thought that it hadn't... affected him, and I got worried, and I said, "I hope that it hasn't - that the bullet hasn't hit a neighbor,"' Zimmerman said.

International notoriety: Zimmerman's case became known around the world

The much-maligned former insurance 
salesman who has recently taken to selling his unique art on eBay said 
he was '100 per cent' sure of his actions that night, and that had he 
not shot Martin, the teen would have killed him.

Zimmerman said that he has had death threats since the trial, which he put down to his portrayal in the media and not his shooting of a teenaged boy.

Zimmerman told Calderón that he can no longer lead a normal life and must wear a bullet-proof vest when he is out in public.

Describing himself as 'totally homeless,' Zimmerman said his family helps him 'a lot.'
