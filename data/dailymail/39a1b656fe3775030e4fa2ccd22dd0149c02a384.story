A BBC radio presenter had to be taken off air after listeners complained that she sounded ‘drunk’.

Paula White, who confessed to listeners that she had had a ‘couple of drinks’, was incoherent during her final show in the afternoon slot.

After 30 minutes, a colleague took over and announced: ‘Paula is not feeling well and has gone home.’

Making waves: BBC Radio DJ Paula White who has been in the broadcasting industry for 20 years

At one point on the Radio Stoke show on Friday, which was meant to have lasted three hours, Ms White said: ‘It’s a P-A-R-T-Y because I said sooooo . . . Some people will say, “Oh, thank goodness she’s gone.” ’ 

The presenter later added: ‘Other people will say, “How will I get the dog to sleep because I know that people play this show out to their dogs.’”

Ms White, who repeatedly stumbled over her words, then announced she was junking the station’s official playlist and would allow listeners to choose their favourite songs. She said: ‘Start your messages with . . . Stoke? Yes, start it with Stoke. I don’t care. Whatever you want to hear this afternoon, it’s like you can hear it.’ Responding to a listener who sent a text message to producers suggesting she was drunk, Ms White replied: ‘I’m not drunk, I’m not drunk. I’ve had a couple of drinks. I’m not drunk.’ Afterwards, the DJ said she would play the track Walking On Sunshine by Katrina And The Waves, adding: ‘This lady won Euro-vision for us a couple of years ago. She wasn’t with the sunshines or the waves.’

However, her attempts to play it failed because of ‘computer problems’ and listeners were treated to a jingle instead. The presenter added: ‘It’s my last day and nothing is working. Why is nothing working?’

Ms White’s last contribution was a rambling account of how she had managed to lose more than a stone in weight. Her colleague Denholm Siergetz then took over, saying: ‘Paula is not feeling well with it being her last afternoon show – so she has gone home.’

Simon Grundy, a breakfast radio show presenter in Sunderland, tweeted last night: ‘It may be her last show, but how come she was left for half an hour sounding drunk?’

Another presenter said: ‘It wasn’t fair to her and it’s not right that the BBC should allow someone so drunk to be on air.’

BBC bosses recently announced that Ms White’s Friday afternoon slot was being moved to Saturdays.

Last night the DJ was unavailable for comment.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Paula White was unable to continue on-air yesterday as she was under par.’
