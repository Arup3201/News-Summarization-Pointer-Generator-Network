Everton midfielder Ross Barkley will return to first-team training at the beginning of next week after recovering from a knee ligament injury.

Barkley is yet to make a competitive appearance for the Toffees so far this season as the 20-year-old was ruled out for up to eight weeks on the eve of the Premier League campaign.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez, who has heaped praise on Barkley, has revealed his star midfielder will return to full training on Monday.

Martinez, speaking to SkySports, said: 'On Monday we expect Ross, with the green light from the medical department, to join the group.

'Now it's a matter of getting him match fit and getting him up to speed. Ross has been working really well and I don't expect any setbacks. I expect Ross to have a real clear path to get his match fitness back.

'From Monday I want him to be part of it and in probably a couple of weeks we should be able to see Ross in the squad.

'His desire and hunger to be in the team is contagious, and that is something I want to have with the group. He'll be like a fresh, new player for us.'

Barkley's return to training will come as music to the ears of Martinez - who is already without the likes of John Stones, Seamus Coleman and James McCarthy.
