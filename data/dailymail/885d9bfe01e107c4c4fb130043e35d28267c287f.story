The 15-year-old who took his own life yesterday has been identified as Coweta Intermediate School ninth grader Triston Stephens

Officials have identified the tragic 15-year-old student who took his own life in his high school’s bathroom yesterday morning.

Triston Stephens, who was in the ninth grade, died around 8.35am Monday at Coweta Intermediate High School in Oklahoma.

His apparent suicide sparked mass panic as Coweta and its neighboring high school were put on lockdown.

Stephens was identified by the state Medical Examiner’s Office, Tulsa World reported. According to the police, the young man died of a single gunshot wound to the head just after the first class on Monday had started.

After the lockdown, ninth grade students were led to the school’s gymnasium while all other students were sent home for the day.

Classes will continue today as normal, though grief counselors will be on-site.

Police are now trying to piece together why Stephens, who was described by teachers as a ‘very fine young man,’ would resort to taking his own life.

It is unclear if Stephens left a suicide note.

Coweta Superintendent Jeff Holmes told Tulsa World that he did not believe Stephens had been bullied, though at a press conference yesterday afternoon, other officials were more vague.

Yesterday evening, shocked students held a candlelight vigil for Stephens to honor his memory. Emotions were raw for many students.

‘I am in shock,’ student Jaci Sappington told FOX 23. ‘I am like shaking right now, it’s so weird.’ A local parishioner was on-site to help students deal with their grief and disbelief.

Students tweeted that they were holding a prayer circle Tuesday morning for Stephens. Grief counsellors will be at the intermediate school today.

Coweta Police Lieutenant Donnie Krumsiek praised faculty and staff for their ‘flawless’ response and quickly putting their schools on lockdown.

He told Newson6.com that they did a ‘tremendous’ job ensuring student safety.

Nearly two months after the horrific massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, anxieties are at a fever pitch over school shootings.
