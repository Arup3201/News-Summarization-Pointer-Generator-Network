Republicans in the House of Representatives are planning to call a vote next week on a contempt resolution against Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the center of an alleged plot to target conservative nonprofit groups for special scrutiny based on their political beliefs.

Lerner, who retired in late 2013 with a government pension, led the agency's Exempt Organizations office and is accused of masterminding a scheme aimed at hobbling tea party groups when they applied for tax-exempt status in the run-up to the 2010 federal elections.

She has twice refused to answer questions during congressional hearings, invoking her Fifth Amendment to remain silent instead of incriminating herself. But Republicans say she waived that right when she gave a lengthy opening statement during a May 2013 hearing, in which she defended herself in no uncertain terms.

GOP leaders suspect she has information linking political appointees in the White House and elsewhere in the Obama administration to the scandal.

The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth: Former IRS Director of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner insisted that she was innocent during a May 22, 2013 congressional hearing, but then refused to answer questions -- prompting a constitutional crisis that House Republicans want to resolve by holding her in criminal contempt

Angry tea partiers have rallied against the IRS since news broke a year ago that the agency targeted their organizations in order to cripple them in the midst of a busy political election season

'If this thing stops at Lois Lerner and doesn't go higher up the food chain, then I'm a Swedish supermodel,' a male aide to a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee staffer joked on Friday.

On April 10, that committee voted along party lines to green-light a contempt resolution, a necessary step before the full House can vote.

The resolution, which is likely to pass in a Republican-dominated House, also refers Lerner's case to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.

That approach is likely to be a dead-end with Attorney General Eric Holder, however.

The full House voted Holder himself in criminal contempt in 2012, in relation to an alleged pattern of hiding documents related to the Operation Fast and Furious gun-walking debacle, but the DOJ has taken no action.

Meanwhile, a federal court is examining a
 parallel civil contempt lawsuit that the House filed against Holder. 
Its goal is to force the DOJ to hand over the documents House 
Republicans subpoenaed years ago.

Lerner's attorney, William W. Taylor III, has asked the oversight committee's Republican majority to consider a face-to-face private interview of Lerner in lieu of her public testimony, but the lawmakers have held firm.

Taylor insisted in an April 28 letter to House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor that 'Ms. Lerner did not waive her Fifth Amendment privilege' by proclaiming her innocence in an open hearing.

He recalled the case of disgraced WorldCom executive Bernie Ebbers,
 who told a House panel in 2002 that 'no one will conclude that I 
engaged in any criminal or fraudulent conduct' – before refusing to 
answer questions.

'Holding
 Ms. Lerner in contempt would not only be unfair and, indeed, 
un-American,' Taylor wrote, 'it would be flatly inconsistent with the 
Fifth Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court.'

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (L) and Speaker John Boehner (C) are ready to force the Lois Lerner stalemate to a legally binding vote

Precedent? Former WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers refused to answer congressional questions in 2002 about his company's $11 billion fraud. Like Lerner, he had already offered a self-serving opening statement

At the time, Democrats universally attacked Ebbers for making a speech during a July 8, 2002 hearing and then refusing to answer 30 questions – including those asking if he was a U.S. citizen who worked for WorldCom.

Max Sandlin, then a Texas Democratic congressman, called for a contempt vote immediately after Ebbers was dismissed.

'I am not aware of this new theory of selective Fifth Amendment,' he said then. 'It's my position that he has waived his Fifth Amendment protections for all purposes.'

Ebbers was ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2005 for his part in WorldCom's then-unprecedented $11 billion public fraud.

Cantor spokesman Rory Cooper told The Washington Post on Thursday that Lerner 'always has an opportunity to address the House by testifying before the House Oversight Committee. That invitation stands.'

Boehner spokesman Michael Steel added that Lerner 'can avoid being held in contempt at any time by testifying fully and honestly, but she has chosen not to.'

Cantor announced Thursday during his regularly weekly preview of the House floor schedule that the Lerner contempt motion would be heard.

@highlight

Next week the House of Representatives will vote on whether to hold former IRS official Lois Lerner in criminal contempt

@highlight

Lerner has refused to answer questions under subpoena about her part in a scheme to target conservative nonprofit groups based on their politics

@highlight

She twice pleaded the Fifth, but gave a lengthy opening hearing statement defending herself – which Republicans say canceled her right to stay silent

@highlight

Her lawyer cites the case of convicted WorldCom swindler Bernie Ebbers, who escaped congressional contempt charges in 2002 after refusing to testify after offering similar remarks defending himself

@highlight

If the motion passes next week, Lerner will be referred to the Justice Department for prosecution, and a federal judge could decide whether Lerner has to testify
