The 23-year-old son of Bernie Madoff's longtime accountant who helped him conceal his notorious Ponzi scheme has committed suicide at medical school in Columbus, Ohio.

Jeremy Friehling was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Thursday at his apartment.

Friehling, of New City, N.Y., is the son of David Friehling, who pleaded guilty in 2009 to nine federal charges of helping conceal Madoff’s $65 billion fraud.

Columbus police found Jeremy Friehling’s body when they visited his apartment after friends had become concerned about him.

Jeremy Friehling apparently posted erratic comments on Facebook throughout Thursday, prompting concerned friends to request local police to conduct a welfare check.

David Friehling and his wife Robin have been married for nearly 30 years and have two other children.

Jeremy Friehling graduated from 
Duke University in 2011 and was attending medical school at Ohio State 
University in Columbus. He was the valedictorian of the 2007 graduating 
class at Clarkstown North High School, reports Lohud.com.

In 2010, Bernie Madoff’s son Mark, committed suicide in a Manhattan apartment on the second anniversary of his father's arrest.

Madoff’s Ponzi scam stole billions of 
dollars and cost many investors millions and, in many cases, their life 
savings. He is now serving 150 years in prison.

Both his sons, Mark and Andrew, worked in senior positions for 
their father's securities firm. They supervised 
Madoff's stock-trading desks, a side of the firm not directly involved in the Ponzi scheme.

On 11 December 2008, Madoff summoned 
his sons to his New York penthouse flat to tell them his investment 
business was 'one big lie'.

Guilty: Friehling's sentencing has been adjourned since 2010 while he cooperates with prosecutors investigating Madoff's business empire

David Friehling became the first of Bernie Madoff's inner circle to be
named as an accomplice in March 2009

Acting U.S. district attorney Lev Dassin
said the accountant 'failed to do his job, and lied to investors and 
regulators in saying that he did.'

Friehling admitted that for 17 years he 
had filed false statements for Bernard L. Madoff 
Investment Securities LLC with the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission.

From
1991 to 2008 Friehling never audited Madoff’s business and each year 
told federal regulators that Madoff’s company had a 'clean audit 
record.' Madoff paid Friehling $12,000 to $14,500 a month as his auditor
from 2004 to 2007.

Friehling,
who became a certified public accountant in 1987 and has since lost his
license, took primary oversight of Madoff’s account in 1991 from his 
father-in-law, Jerome Horowitz, who met Madoff in 1963 through the 
investor’s wife.

Friehling and Horowitz ran a nondescript office inside a
strip mall on North Main Street in New City.

As
part of his guilty plea, Friehling forfeited $3.1 million and two 
properties, including a three-story, 4,437-square-foot house South 
Mountain Road in New City.

His sentencing has been adjourned 
several times since 2010 based upon his cooperation with federal 
investigators.

He is scheduled for sentencing in April 2013, but that is 
likely to be adjourned again because prosecutors say he’s a witness in 
another case.

When eventually sentenced, he faces up to 105 years in jail.

Madoff’s victims are continuing to try to get more of their stolen money back.

In July, the trustee seeking compensation for 
Madoff’s defrauded former clients asked a bankruptcy judge in July 
to release roughly $1.49 billion to $2.43 billion in recovered funds, 
several times more than they have received so far, which has amounted to
$1.1 billion.

Irving Picard, the trustee, said the
payout would cover more than 1,220 customer accounts. He estimates that
Madoff victims lost about $20 billion from the scheme.

Madoff used the money he collected 
from his numerous clients to fund a lavish lifestyle for his family, who owned a $7 million penthouse in Manhattan, as well as homes on 
Long Island, in Florida and on the coast of France.

Madoff kept the scheme going by 
sending his investors fraudulent financial statements, leading them to 
believe that they were making money. But it all came crashing down with 
the onset of the recession, which had depleted his client list.
