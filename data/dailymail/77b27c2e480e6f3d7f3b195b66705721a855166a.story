More than a year after Donald Wheeler killed himself, the child welfare worker has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the death of a five-year-old girl who was beaten to death by her father after being placed in his care by the Department of Human Services.

After the death of Serenity Deal, 5, DHS employees came under fire for placing her with her father even though she was injured twice during overnight visits
with him in January 2011. He claimed he had accidentally dropped her.

'I find nothing in any of the investigation that does anything but exonerate Donald Wheeler,' Pottawatomie County District Attorney Richard Smothermon told NewsOK Friday. 'Donald Wheeler repeatedly tried to warn these [workers] not to 
place this child with Sean Brooks, and he was repeatedly ignored.'

Wheeler's body was discovered against a barb wire fence in the woods near an Oklahoma baseball camp by a family friend in July 2011.

'He
came out here to walk at 7:30 this morning,' said an unidentified 
family friend in a 911 call recording. 'His wife called me, found his 
car empty, and we've been walking all over this campground and i just 
found him on the ground.'

At the time, Wheeler was on paid administrative leave from his position and one of four Oklahoma Department of Human Services employees under investigation in the death.

They'll pay: Samantha Deal is suing the Oklahoma DHS for $3 million for negligence in the death of her daughter. Deal is in prison for molesting a young boy

Serenity was beaten to death by Brooks just a month after she was placed in his care.

Serenity's official cause of death was a head 
injury. An autopsy also noted she had seven recently fractured ribs as 
well as scrapes and bruises covering her head and body, NewsOK reported.

Records show Wheeler had urged caution because Brooks demonstrated abusive behavior in the past.

As Wheeler was exonerated, two other DHS workers, Pottawatomie County child welfare specialist Randy J. Lack and supervisor Jennifer Shawn, were charged with suppressing evidence in the case.

The girl's mother, Samantha Deal, is suing the Oklahoma Department of Human Services for $3 million as she believes the state's 
negligence led to the girl's 'untimely passing.'

The suit calls for $1 
million for each of her two daughters and herself.

The mother is herself in prison after being sentenced to 15 years for molesting a young boy.

Serenity had previously been in foster care because of the charges against her mother. She was killed less than a month after she was placed in his care in his Oklahoma City apartment.

In December, Brooks, 32, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in jail.

The death sparked public outrage against the department and led to the firing of two workers.

Another resigned.

Loss: Serenity also told state workers her father had dropped her and they believed the story

The agency's director, Howard 
Hendrick, also retired as public confidence in his leadership plummeted.

The agency has since admitted that workers did not handle the case appropriately as they did not check the man's criminal record and discover that he had been violent in the past.

During visits to his home the January before her death, Serenity suffered black eyes and bruises on her face, and said her father had dropped her, a story which DHS 
workers accepted.

Workers were also accused of failing to give the court photos or a full description of the injuries or divulge that Brooks did not seek medical care for his daughter.

'The negligent acts of OKDHS were the 
proximate cause of Serenity Deal's untimely passing and the claimant ...
has suffered damages as a result thereof,' the claim states.

Angelic: Serenity died of a head trauma and had seven recent fractured ribs. State workers failed to report the details of the previous injuries to the courts and did not check Brooks's criminal background

Retired: Following public outcry, former Oklahoma DHS director Howard Hendrick stepped down

'It's awful. It's awful,' Deal's attorney, Jim Loepp, told NewsOK. 'What DHS did, it was just horrifying to me.'

'We are reviewing the claim,' said DHS attorney, Richard Freeman.

It comes after Serenity's grandparents, Chuck and Annette Deal, made a claim against the state over the girl's death. Serenity had lived with them for three years before going to foster homes.

They tried to adopt her but she was placed in foster care when they were accused of letting Serenity stay with her mother overnight.

Last September, DHS commissioners formed a committee to investigate her death. She was the fourth child under the supervision of DHS in two Oklahoma counties to die in nine years.
