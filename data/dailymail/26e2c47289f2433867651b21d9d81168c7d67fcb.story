Popular: Retailers have told health bosses that Mary Berry show The Great British Bake Off is behind a surge in sugar consumption

The popularity of The Great British Bake Off has been blamed for a spike in sugar intake as amateur cake makers take to the kitchen inspired by the hit TV show.

Health bosses have been told by retailers that the BBC series featuring judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood is behind the rising amount of sugar consumed in the UK.

Experts have recommended that people half their sugar consumption, but during talks over government dietary recommendations leading figures from the retail industry reportedly told Department of Health and Public Health England chiefs that Bake Off was behind a sugar surge.

'People at the meeting were blaming Mary Berry for a huge increase in the popularity of sugar as an ingredient,' a retail source present at the talks told The Grocer magazine.

According to the most recent National Diet and Nutrition Survey figures, which cover 2008 to 2012, table sugar and preserves make up the single biggest contribution to adult sugar intake at 17 per cent.

This compares to the 16 per cent from soft drinks, and nine per cent from confectionery, while buns, cakes and pastries made up another seven per cent.

The 65 and over age group had the highest mean consumption of ‘table sugar, preserves and sweet spreads’, with 14g per day, while adults aged between 18 and 64 consumed 11g, and children from 11 to 18 six.

Earlier this year, the World Health Organisation recommended that people halved their sugar intake - limiting consumption to around six teaspoons a day to avoid obesity, heart disease and other serious illnesses.

The guideline amount was slashed dramatically amid fears that sugar poses the same threat to health as tobacco, and experts blame it for millions of premature deaths across the world every year.

In its draft report on carbohydrates, including sugar, the Government's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition backed the WHO sugar guidelines that around five per cent of energy intake should come from free sugars, down from the previous recommendation of ten.

However, according to The Grocer, there has been criticism from retailers who say the committee has not explained in detail how it reached its recommendations. 

Consultation on the new document has taken place over the summer and ended last week, while in June Public Health England also released a new paper outlining the steps being taken to help families reduce their sugar intake, such as refreshing the 'Five a Day' campaign.

Trend: Since Bake Off first aired in August 2010, sales of baking equipment, including flour, sugar and cooking chocolate, have increased while the show is on air

It states: 'People’s health would benefit if average sugar intakes in England were reduced. Sugar increases the risk of consuming too many calories, which, if sustained, causes weight gain and obesity.'

A study released earlier this month showed that since Bake Off first aired in August 2010, sales of baking equipment, including flour, sugar and cooking chocolate, have increased while the show is on air - although the real baking boom occurs over Christmas. 

Following the Baked Alaska challenge, supermarket Waitrose reported an increase in the sales of vanilla ice cream, vanilla extract, caster sugar and eggs, as home bakers rushed to make their own versions. 

The fifth series of the show is currently airing on BBC1, having made the switch from BBC2 this year.

Bin-cident: More people than ever have tuned in to Bake Off this year, with the series's 'bin gate' scandal attracting its biggest ever audience

More people than ever have tuned in, with the series's 'bin gate' scandal attracting its biggest ever audience.  

The controversial episode - in which contestant Iain Watters dumped his 'showstopper' baked Alaska  to cause an unlikely national kerfuffle - drew 10.25 million viewers, once viewers on catch-up TV services were added on. 

The previous high for Bake Off was the 2013 final which had a consolidated score of 9.4 million with the programme shown on BBC2, prior to the move to a new channel for this series.

Watters's culinary catastrophe came after fellow contestant Diana Beard took his dish out of the freezer prompting many viewers to call for him to be reinstated. She subsequently pulled out of the show due to ill health.

MailOnline has contacted the Department of Health and the BBC for comment.
