The Duchess of Cornwall has hinted at the similarities between herself and the sixth and final wife of Henry VIII, Katherine Parr, who had already been married twice by the time she married the Tudor king,

Camilla, who married Prince Charles following her divorce from Andrew Parker-Bowles, made the comments in a foreword to a new collection of prayers written by Parr -Â  who was married to the king from July 1543 until his death in 1547 - and now translated into modern English.

In the book, The Spice of Wisdom, put together by Rev John Partington, the Duchess writes that Parr - England's most-married queen, with four husbands in total - had a 'passionate' and 'eventful life', and that her voice 'speaks to us still'.

As reported by Melanie Hall and Jasper Copping in the Telegraph, Camilla writes: 'Her commitment to what is right and good, 
expressed with humility and openness to others, is as valuable now as it
 was in the more turbulent times of the Tudors.'

She goes on to say: 'Few women's writings have come down to us from so many 
centuries ago. In the pages that follow are found not only some of the 
carefully crafted prayers that Katherine intended for publication, but 
also the more personal hopes and fears of a woman who was as passionate 
in her faith as she was in other aspects of her eventful life.'

When Catherine Parr married Henry VIII in 1543 - here captured in an 18th century drawing - she had already been married twice

Parr was married to Edward Burgh in 1529 and widowed in 1533. She then married John Neville in 1534, only to be widowed again in 1543. She married Henry VIII in the summer of that year.

Camilla, meanwhile, was married to Andrew Parker-Bowles in 1973 until their divorce in 1995. She had had a relationship with Charles prior to her first marriage.

Both women are known to be or have been close to their step-children. Katherine was step-mother to Henry's children Edward, Mary and Elizabeth, and when her only biological child, a daughter with fourth husband Thomas Seymour, was born in 1548 she named her Mary in honour of her step-daughter.

Katherine has been credited with campaigning tirelessly for the restoration of the line of succession in the new Act of Succession of 1544 that allowed Mary, then Elizabeth, to take the throne after their brother Edward.

Camilla is known to enjoy a close friendship with her stepsons Princes William and Harry, and to have mentored Kate when she joined the royal family upon her 2011 marriage to Charles and Diana's eldest son.

The Duchess became involved with the book due to her close friendship with the owner of Sudeley Castle - Parr's former residence and the site of her burial - Lady Ashcombe.

She was shown a copy of the prayer collection by Rev Partington, who then wrote to her and asked if she would contribute a foreword because he saw the similarities between the two of them.

He admitted he was 'chuffed' when she agreed to do so.
