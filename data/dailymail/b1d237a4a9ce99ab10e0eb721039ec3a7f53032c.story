A French chef opened a new restaurant in Pakistan - only to then ban any Pakistanis from eating there.

Philippe Lafforgue's restaurant specialises in traditional French cuisine with coarse-grained pork sausages, blood pudding and fine wine on his menu.

Lafforgue, who moved to the country in 2005, wanted his restaurant to exclusively serve expats wanting to eat non-halal meat and to drink alcohol.

But his small bistro 'La Maison' in Pakistan’s capital Islamabad was shut down by police after he banned any Pakistanis from coming in unless joined by a foreigner.

Raid: Philippe Lafforgue's restaurant La Maison in Islamabad has been shut down by police after he refused to let Pakistanis dine in his restaurant unless accompanied by a foreigner

He was raided by police after Cyril Almeida, a prominent Pakistani journalist, complained his restaurant was refusing reservations from anyone except 'foreign-passport holders'.

After being refused a table, Almeida turned to social media, launching a campaign with the hashtag 'NoToApartheid'.

Almeida said: 'It is so obviously offensive and obnoxious... why should a private individual establish a club or an establishment which blocks out the very people of the country it is operating in?'

He published the address of 'La Maison' online and then contacted the police, the ministry of the interior and the local member of parliament.

Two senior police officials then tried to book a table at the restaurant, which is decorated with ornate carpets and works of art, but they too were refused a table.

Lafforgue claims he only barred Pakistanis from his restaurant because the law prohibits the sale of alcohol to Muslims but not to 'non-Muslim foreigners'

Officers then raided La Maison, arrested
 two local staff and confiscated some 300 bottles of wine, beer and even
 Perrier — possibly thinking the sparkling mineral water was champagne -
 before shutting the restaurant down. 

Lafforgue claims he felt he had no choice but to refuse locals entry to his restaurant because serving alcohol to Muslims is illegal.

Former socialist prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto banned alcohol in 1977, bowing to pressure from Islamic parties. But authorities allow its sale to non-Muslims, primarily for festive purposes, and 'non-Muslim foreigners'.

'All that I have done was to abide by Pakistani law. If I did something illegal, I would have been condemned by mullahs and visited by the police [earlier],' says Lafforgue, who was previously a chef in France and moved to Pakistan to work as a firework technician.

In the diplomatic enclave, a high-security area of the capital which houses most foreign embassies, private restaurants and clubs sell alcohol to foreigners and their Pakistani guests.

Many prominent Pakistanis were left outraged by Lafforgue's stance - calling it offensive and obnoxious

The same goes for major hotels around 
the country, where foreigners pay handsomely for beer that might come 
served in a teapot or coffee cup to allay suspicions.

Some posh restaurants operate a 'bring your own booze' rule as long as customers are discreet.

Even those who obtain licences are sometimes forced to close for days at a time by the police, who are believed to run extortion rackets.

After the raid, which happened on Saturday, Lafforgue was able to retake possession of his establishment.

Confident he is in the right, he awaits the release of his two employees and the return of his stock, and hopes to re-open his restaurant — this time by registering it as a 'private club'.

Almeida says he doesn’t have a problem with a private club, but says nationality should not be a reason to refuse someone membership.

'Having a membership criteria does not mean you can exclude people on the basis of nationality,' he says.
