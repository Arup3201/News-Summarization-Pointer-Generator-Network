Prosecutors demanded yesterday that Briton Andrea Waldeck be jailed for 16 years for smuggling drugs into Indonesia.

But the former police support officer, 43, could still face the death penalty if judges decide to hand down a harsher sentence.

Waldeck admitted trafficking 3lbs of crystal meth worth £3,000 last year on a flight from China. Her guilty plea could result in a similar shock sentence to the one given to British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford, 57.

Seeking solace: Andrea Waldeck reads the Bible as she waits for her trial inside a court room, in Surabaya, Indonesia, today

She is appealing for clemency after being sentenced to death for admitting smuggling drugs into Bali.

Yesterday, Waldeck sat in the court in
 Surabaya in a prisoner’s red bib for three hours listening to the 
evidence via an interpreter.

She
 claimed she carried the drugs, hidden in her underwear, after being 
threatened by a male friend. Waldeck made no public comment yesterday.

But on January 6, she will go back to the court and plans to make a statement  pleading for leniency. 

The
 judges will then announce their  sentence. Indonesia has some of the 
toughest anti-drug laws in the world and carries out executions by 
firing squad.

Miss Waldeck, who at an earlier 
hearing had pleaded guilty to the smuggling crime in order to avoid a 
mandatory death sentence, sat in a bright red prisoner’s bib as a 
prosecutor outlined the case against her.

He told how police had raided her Surabaya hotel room and found the drugs in black bags that had been hidden in her underwear.

As
 well as demanding the 16 year sentence, the prosecution asked that Miss
 Waldeck’s laptop computer be confiscated and the suitcase that had 
carried the drugs be destroyed.

Crime and punishment: Andrea Waldeck, center, is facing 16 years in an Indonesian jail and a £100,000 fine after admitting smuggling drugs

In addition to the 16 years, 
prosecutors want her to serve, they asked the judges to fine her two 
billion rupiahs - or £100,000 - or if she fails to pay that, to serve a 
further six months imprisonment.

The case was adjourned until January 6
 when Miss Waldeck will be able to speak in her defence in the hope of 
winning a reduced sentence.

Police
 and narcotics officers had been told Miss Waldeck was carrying the 
drugs and waited until she had checked into the three star hotel before 
raiding her room.

They found the drugs in black plastic bags that she had previously packed in her underwear to pass through customs.

A court official who has been helping 
her through Indonesia’s complicated legal system told the Mail that Miss
 Waldeck had intended travelling to Indonesia from her base in China to 
try to set up a furniture import-export business.

But
 she has told officials that a male Nigerian friend in China had 
threatened her if she did not agree to carry the crystal meth to 
Indonesia.

She said he had told her: ‘I’m Nigerian. You know about Nigerians. We kill people.’

Miss
 Waldeck is alleged to have told lawyers that she received no reward for
 carrying the drugs, but agreed to undertake the risky operation because
 of the threats she had received.

She sat in the sweltering Surabaya court as 
prosecutors told how police and narcotics officers had been tipped off 
that she was carrying the drugs and waited until she had checked into 
the three star hotel before raiding her room.

A court official who has been helping 
her through Indonesia’s complicated legal system told the Mail that Miss
 Waldeck had intended travelling to Indonesia from her base in China to 
try to set up a furniture import-export business.

Miss Waldeck is alleged to have told lawyers that she received no reward for carrying the drugs, but agreed to undertake the risky operation because of the threats she had received.

There are no guarantees that she will escape the death sentence.

British woman Lindsay Sandiford, who admitted smuggling drugs into Bali, heard Prosecutors ask for her to be jailed for 15 years - but the judges,  in a shock verdict, handed down the death sentence.

Miss Waldeck has declined to make any public comment except to tell how she tried to keep news of her arrest from friends in the UK.

She has also revealed that she plans to write a book.
