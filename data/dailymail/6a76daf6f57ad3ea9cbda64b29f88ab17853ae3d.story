French starlet Nabil Fekir wants a move to Arsenal if he leaves current club Lyon, according to the player's father.

Fekir, who has been in excellent form this season, has been linked to a move to England, with Manchester City also mentioned as a possible destination.

But the player's father says he would rather his sn joined Arsenal than City, where he thinks the 21-year-old would be forced to sit on the bench. 

Nabil Fekir has been in superb form this season, scoring six times in his 14 Ligue 1 appearances so far

'Nabil would like to finish first or second and play Champions League football with Lyon,' Mohamed Fekir told Le Parisien.

'If he leaves, it will be for Arsenal. It is the only club that can enable him to progress, with Arsène Wenger. He will not go to Manchester City to sit on the bench.'

Fekir, whose performances this season have prompted comparisons to Lionel Messi, has scored six goals in 14 Ligue 1 appearances this season after breaking into the first team last year.

The France Under 21 star would only leave current club Lyon for Arsenal according to his father
