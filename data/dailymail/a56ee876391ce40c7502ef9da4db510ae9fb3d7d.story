On a night when German football seeks redemption in the Ruhr Valley, Martin O'Neill's presence on the touchline in the Veltins Arena may cause further angst for the under-fire world champions.

Home fans of a mature vintage can recall the central role played by O'Neill, as a player, when Germany lost two games in a qualifying campaign for the first, and so far, only time.

On November 16, 1983, O'Neill captained Northern Ireland to a famous 1-0 win over West Germany in Hamburg — the same day, incidentally, the Republic of Ireland mauled Malta 8-0.

It followed a 1-0 win in Belfast a year earlier, yet Billy Bingham's battlers were cruelly denied a place in the 1984 European finals on goal difference by the team they conquered.

To this day, Germany have never lost twice in the qualifiers for a major finals but that would happen should the Republic of Ireland tonight follow up Poland's win over the world champions.

In that event, O'Neill would have a unique connection to the events, as a player and manager.

Any form of 'a result', he acknowledged last night would give the squad 'a massive lift' ahead of the final qualifier of 2014, away to Scotland next month.

O'Neill doffed a forelock to the four-time world champions, by insisting they would still top Group D comfortably. 'They have a habit of qualifying,' he observed. 'I think Germany have had a history of roaring back pretty quickly from whatever setbacks they have.'

It followed Joachim Low's briefing earlier where he spoke casually about the 2016 finals as if he had already booked training grounds, hotels and put their poolside towels down in France. Being the efficient Germans, they probably have.

O'Neill didn't disagree that the game carried echoes of his Champion League duels against Europe's elite with Celtic. But he didn't tarry long over nostalgia.

'This isn't Celtic. This is us. We've got to perform. Easy words, I know, but that's what it will come down too,' he said.

A lthough they are unbeaten at home in 18 competitive games, if ever there was a good time to play Germany, tonight's engagement is as opportune as any.

Rocked by retirements following their World Cup triumph, and riddled by injuries to front-liners, there is indecision in the ranks following the unexpected loss to Poland where inefficiencies in front of goal cost them dear.

Germany don't lose qualifiers, and have never lost successive ones.

Low is demanding a response this evening — and there will be hell to pay if he doesn't get one.

Ireland had the advantage of a light warm-up against Gibraltar on Saturday, where an overdue cavalcade of goals has injected a welcome wave of confidence. 'If you said before the campaign started that we'd be sitting here tonight with six points on the board, nine goals, you'd have taken it,' said O'Neill, who feels the Irish mind-set tonight will be similar but the 'approach' to the game will differ.

'We have a game plan which we hope can frustrate [Germany] and work to our advantage. That said, the best-laid plans can disappear.

'If we sit in all day, they will pick you off. It's a game to relish and one we want to go out and get something from.'

O'Neill, who gave training in Gelsenkirchen a skip last night after a morning session in Malahide, was keeping his cards close to his chest over his likely starting XI.

He knows it but the players don't and will be kept on their toes until a couple of hours before kick-off.

Prior to his hat-trick on Saturday, Robbie Keane was vulnerable to sacrifice as the lone ranger in attack.

But Keane has a presence about him and the Germans will be wary of his threat and reputation — they haven't forgotten his last-gasp equaliser in Ibaraki in the 2002 World Cup. Keane fed off a Niall Quinn knock down that night and has never sparkled away from home as a sole striker. Most recently, he was isolated against Georgia, and was substituted.

Springing him from the bench if Ireland need a goal may be the most profitable way to use him for a more demanding contest such as this. O'Neill spoke of Keane in glowing terms last night, insisting he 'saw no reason' to change his captain when he became manager and spoke of his 'excellent influence' in the squad.

Pointedly, he warned against 'assuming' that Keane would start.

As for the Ireland captain, who is usually chipper before game, he was strangely subdued — perhaps he is fearful of being told to bring a long coat to the game.

'Whenever the manager names the team, you've got to respect his decision. My job is to score goals and I go into every game believing I can,' he said.

Even so, changes are certain tonight with Glenn Whelan and Stephen Quinn pushing to start in central midfield after missing the Gibraltar game.

The back five should remain intact which will see John O'Shea become the sixth Irishman to complete a century of caps — an outstanding achievement for a model pro.

'The fact that John has been picked by so many different Irish managers tells you a lot about his qualities,' said O'Neill.

A year ago, a makeshift Irish XI rolled into the Rhineland under Noel King's interim management, and were unfortunate to lose 3-0, while 12 months previous, Germany skittled Ireland for six in Dublin.

If any motivation spur was needed, those results should provide it.

Getting a result won't be easy, it never is against the Germans but Ireland, even without Seamus Coleman and James McCarthy, have a couple of things going on their side.

They have momentum, a rising self-belief, a striker on top form, and a manager who has never been intimidated by the reputation of German football.

Against the 'wounded animal' of Germany, such dynamics could be sufficient to keep the Euro 2016 roadshow upright.
