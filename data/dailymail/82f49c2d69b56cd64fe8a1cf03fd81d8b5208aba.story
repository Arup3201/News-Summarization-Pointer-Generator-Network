An artist has managed to turn the most unlikely of places into her own personal yoga studio by striking poses in the streets of the world's busiest cities.

In New York, Madrid, Paris and in her native Ljubljana, Slovenia, Anja Humljan has been surprising passers-by with her flexible routines. 

Anja, a yoga teacher of 12 years and former top athlete, decided to embark on her scheme over the last year and has now produced a book of her work called The Urban Yoga Photo Book.

Artist and yogi Anja Humljan has been creating dynamic poses in some of the world's biggest cities, New York, Madrid, Paris and Lujubljana

She worked with four photographers around the world: Jaka Vinek, in New York, Emilio P. Doiztua, in Madrid, Antoine Le Grand, in Paris and Primo Lukeic, in Ljubljana. 

Together they created this amazing series of photographs that make the daily commute look tame in comparison. 

Anja, 31, says that the project came from a desire to explore the human body's relationship with the city.

'The photos are picturing my journey as an architect and a yogi using The Urban Yoga to explore alternative ways of understanding the relationship between the urban environment and our sensuous body.

Anja said that the reaction she received from passers-by varied from city to city

'Photos were taken during the course of one year in places I worked as a freelance architect and designer: New York, Madrid, Paris and Ljubljana. 

'Every city featured in The Urban Yoga photo series has a special place in my heart and shaped me as a researcher in architecture.'

Anja says that the image produced was as much influenced by each of the photographers as they were by her posing. 

'Choosing the location depended on the photographer, the city and the time of the year. I had been always excited to hear the ideas of the photographer and I enjoyed trying them out. 

Anja, who practised yoga for the photo series in a footless white leotard, chose locations where she had worked before as a freelance architect

For each pose Anja aimed to 'connect, intertwine and mimic the urban space', which in this case mean a handstand between boxes on a truck

'So the final photo was a synergy between the photographer and myself. Sometimes we chose locations as we strolled through the city and sometimes in advance. 

'With those chosen in advance, it sometimes happened that as we got there and tried them out we realised that they did not work at all.'

When it came to deciding where and how to pose the final result was anything but random with Anja carefully considering the message she wanted to convey.

Anja thought long and hard about how her poses, such as sinuously dangling from scaffolding, could best convey her message of urban unity

'As far as the poses are concerned, my aim was to connect, intertwine and mimic the urban space, so that the photos functioned as a metaphor for the fact that while moving through space, we subconsciously mimic and measure spatial configuration. 

'Moreover, to invite people to surrender to urban space with their whole sensuous body and give themselves up to feelings that are running through it.'

Anja added that she found it fascinating to see different reactions in the different countries she visited. 

'It had been also very interesting to observe people in different cities and how they react towards the making of The Urban Yoga. 

'In New York, for example, they saw it as a spectacle, stopping their cars to take pictures, making traffic congestions, clapping as we finished finished the shot. 

'In Paris, on the the contrary, it seemed as if none cared at all, so it was much easier to focus. In Ljubljana, people were amazed, but, they were standing there and observing quietly.'

'In Madrid people were really helpful watching over me so I do not fall or get hurt, which was really sweet.' 

As well as posing outdoors, Anja also practiced some of her positions inside homes, here emerging from a large white bathtub

The images will be displayed in the Urban Yoga Book a publication that sees a collection of the artist's images

Anja says that one of her favourite places to pose was her home town in Slovenia as she had a more interactive audience.  

'It was also a bit different, because it is my home town so many people we knew were passing by and together we were making jokes, which made the shooting lots of fun.' 

The yogi hopes that her project will help communicate her message of unity between humans and the urban landscape. 

'As a yoga teacher of 12 years I based my practice on the notion that our guiding principle is to live in harmony with ourselves as well as with the environment - any environment.

'Thus, I believe urban landscape should not be regarded as something, which disturbs our harmony, but rather as a vital element that contributes to it. 

'Architecture with all its constructive fields makes up the urban landscape - the city, the inescapable environment of contemporary humans. This is where The Urban Yoga steps in.' 

Anja's book was successfully funded on Kickstarter and should be available by the end of March. In the meantime for more information visit: www.theurbanyoga.com or email order@theurbanyoga.com.
