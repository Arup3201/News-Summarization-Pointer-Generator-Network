It describes itself as  the warmest corner of  the British Isles ... not  that you’d know it from  this picture.

The worst snow storms in 26 years have caused havoc on the Channel Islands this week, leaving drifts up to 8ft deep.

The airport on Guernsey had to be shut for two days while more than 15,000 tons of snow were removed from the runway.

Wintry: These are the incredible scenes of 8ft snow drifts which wreaked havoc in the holiday isle of Guernsey - the warmest corner of the UK

Deep: The Channel Island has ground to a halt over the past few days following the worst snow storms in decades

Snowy: These pictures were taken by Danielle Stonebridge, 21, of her father Dave, 61

The islands caught the same storms 
that crippled northern France, where shoulder-deep drifts led to Channel
Tunnel trains being cancelled and long queues on the M20 as lorries 
waited for delayed ferries.

Although most of the Guernsey and Jersey snow is now melting, weather men predict another cold snap next week.

This picture was taken by  Danielle Stonebridge, 21, a  Guernsey resident and part- time photographer, of her father Dave, 61.

Bleak: The unseasonably cold weather was still felt across Britain today after temperatures plummeted overnight to -8C. Although conditions were not as bad as this in Guernsey

Knee-deep: These residents of Guernsey made the most of the wintry conditions

She said: ‘I have never seen snow like
this before, my dad can remember something like this when he was around
ten years old, but there is just so much of it. It brings the child out
in me and I have been out in the snow playing, it has been great.

Although it is hard to get around, a five minute journey took me three 
hours, the roads are absolute carnage.’

The blizzard conditions were the worst
seen on the islands for almost three decades, the senior forecaster at 
Guernsey Met Office said.

Cold: Britain was still feeling the unseasonably cold weather today after temperatures plummeted overnight. Bob Ripley, 62, from Richmond, looks at the icicles at The Bow Lee Beck at Gibsons Cave in Teesdale

Freezing: Many people woke up to work this morning to find heavy frost on gardens and windscreens. Temperatures in Teesdale fell to -7C last night

Stunning: This picture of The Bow Lee Beck at Gibsons Cave in Teesdale looked like it could have been taken in the middle of December

Martin Crozier added: ‘You have to go back to January 1987 to have the sort of depth of snow and drifting.

‘This one has thrown up some enormous 
drifts which I don’t think we had in 1987 so people will compare it to 
the 1970s and even 1963.’

On mainland Britain, things look  a little more promising with  temperatures set to rise slightly over the weekend.

But the respite may be over quickly as
heavy rain and overnight frosts are forecast by Tuesday accompanied by a
return of the biting easterly winds that brought temperatures recently 
down to as low as minus 8C.

Frosty: This is a scene which would have greeted many motorists as they headed to work this morning. This BMW car was covered in frost in Danbury, Essex

Wintry: Temperatures dropped during the night to -8C in large parts of the UK. This image shows the frost on a car in Essex

Icy: Forecasters have predicted that the cold weather will not go away, with snow expected this weekend. The frost which settled on this BMW made a number of attractive patterns

Chris Burton, forecaster for 
Meteogroup, warned that though not as bitter as the past week, 
temperatures are ‘definitely not warming up anytime soon’.

He said: ‘It will be a touch milder over the next couple of days but still cold for the time of year.

‘It will remain unsettled with quite 
heavy rain on Friday and this will still be cold enough to form sleet 
and snow on higher grounds.

‘There are hints that there could be 
another cold spell developing next week, certainly enough to make 
overnight frosts quite likely.

‘It’s definitely not warming up any time soon.’

Gloomy: Like many parts of the UK, Howgill Fells is seeing unseasonably cold weather for this time of year
