Floyd Mayweather put all the 'will they, won't they fight' speculation with Manny Pacquiao to one side as he enjoyed the delights of a relaxing fish pedicure.

The 37-year-old shared the video called 'somewhere in another country' via his Instagram, as he continued on his travels around the world.

The heavily-talked about fight was all set to be announced for May 2 in Las Vegas, but Mayweather was quick to play down talk of an agreement on his Shots account.

He posted: 'While they continue to lie about making the fight... I'm just going to continue to travel and explore the world on my private jet. #FightNotMadeYet #Jamaica.' 

Pacquiao and Mayweather came face-to-face for the first time when they both attended the game between the Miami Heat and Milwaukee Bucks. 

The two of them swapped phone numbers before meeting up again at a hotel to discuss the details of the fight.

Pacquiao had been calling out the undefeated champion for a number of years and thought he had finally got his wish - until the deal stalled and it's unclear if it's going to be resolved.

The 37-year-old is still unbeaten and if this fight happens, it could well be his last in professional boxing
