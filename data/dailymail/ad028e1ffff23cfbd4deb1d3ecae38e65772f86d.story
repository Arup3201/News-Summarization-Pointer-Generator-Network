Bolton Wanderers striker Craig Davies may not have been much of a hero on the pitch this season, but he's certainly been proving his chivalry off it.

The 29-year-old rescued an elderly couple after their car broke down leaving them stranded on a busy road in Bolton.

Davies stopped to help move the car to a safe location before driving off to buy a can of petrol for pensioners Brian and Jennifer Armitage so they could refill their tank and be on their way.

The former Manchester City youth team player, who rejected any offer of payment for the petrol, waited around to ensure the couple got away safely.

The pair were so impressed with Davies they wrote to Bolton manager Neil Lennon.  

Brian, an 81-year-old Wanderers fan, told the Manchester Evening News: 'We got Craig a box of chocolates for his troubles. We were taking them and the letters to the club when we happened to see him in Tescos.

'He recognised us both straight away and we recognised him. Craig was absolutely brilliant and a really pleasant chap.

'It just shows that not all footballers are money grabbers and that they do possess humanity.'

Lennon said: 'It is a great story and a fantastic gesture by Craig. It puts him and the club in a very good light. He is well trained!'

Bolton manager Neil Lennon said it was a fantastic gesture that reflected well on him and the club
