How would you survive the apocalypse? 

Stick to conventional weapons? Conserve supplies? Or use light and noise to distract zombies so you can sneak by undetected?

In Dead Rising 3, how you stay alive is entirely up to you. But this would not be a true Dead Rising game without the franchise’s delightful zeal for the absurd. 

Crash and burn: How you escape the city is left entirely up to you... and you can be as crazy as you want

You can don a full set of knight armor and build a laser sword, put on a luchador mask and pile drive zombies, or strip down to a banana hammock while wielding a fireman’s axe.

Hours can be spent building insane weapons out of random parts, such as a teddy bear with machine guns strapped to its arms, or joy ride in race cars while plowing through crowds of zombies.

Set ten years after the events of Fortune City in Dead Rising 2, you play a mechanic named Nick Ramos trying to escape the fictional city of Los Perdidos, California before a military strike reduces everything to dust.

But what it lacks in an original plot, it makes up in other areas. Take the SmartGlass integration, that allows you to set navigation waypoints guiding you and your co-op partner around the city, locate weapon caches, and call in deadly military airstrikes.

Or, when Nick discovers a transmitter, an in-game character will call and text your real-life mobile device with advice and hints.   

To complement the sandbox-style gameplay, there are a number of Combo Vehicles. These include the likes of devastating RollerHawg – a hybrid between a motorcycle and Steamroller with flamethrower attachments.

Stunning: Dead Rising 3 looks much better than the last two games - making the most out of the hardware

On what we’ve seen far, Dead Rising 3 could be the Xbox One launch title of choice.

Dead Rising 3 is an Xbox One exclusive released on November 22.
