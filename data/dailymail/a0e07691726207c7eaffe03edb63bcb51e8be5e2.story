A grandmother has been banned from a village rugby club for her 'bad' behaviour. 

Lillian Mort, 74, has been accused of standing on the touchline and hurling abuse at referees and rival players during matches at Pyle RFC near Bridgend, in South Wales.

The club was fined £50 by Welsh rugby chiefs after Mrs Mort shouted at a referee during a game.

Red card: Lifelong Pyle RFC fan Lillian Mort has been banned from watching games at her village rugby club

Banned: Pyle RFC was fined £50 by Welsh rugby chiefs after Mrs Mort shouted at a referee

The final straw came when she was caught trying to spend beer tokens handed out to players after a match.

She was banned for three months after supporting Pyle RFC for the last 50 years.

The ban will stop her from watching matches and having a drink at the club in the village of Pyle.

She said: 'I feel terrible. I've been going to watch games since I was in my 30s.

'I am a loyal fan, probably the oldest they've got and they've kicked me into touch.

Dedicated: Mrs Mort has vowed to carry on watching the team through the steel railings at the side of the pitch

'The committee think they have got the better of me but I am not going to leave it there.'

Mrs Mort has vowed to carry on watching the team through the steel railings along the boundary of the pitch.

She said: 'I still go down the club and watch games but I am not allowed on the field.

'I watch through the fencing - I feel like I'm in jail.'

Club officials claim they wrote 'a dozen' letters to the grandmother asking her to improve her behaviour.

But she was finally shown the red card after being accused of abusing  committee members when she was told she could not use beer tokens given to her by player grandson David Pound, 22.

Mr Pound said: 'I went down to see the last game and my gran was watching through the fence.

'I couldn't believe it - most of the players are not happy about it.'

Club rules state that only players can use beer tokens in the bar after matches.

Chairman Clifford Ricketts said: 'We 
wrote her a dozen letters asking her to behave but she took no heed of 
them so we banned her.

'We do not want to ban anybody from the club but we did not want the hassle. She is lucky she did not have longer.'

Mrs Mort will be on 12-months probation at the club when her three months ban is over.
