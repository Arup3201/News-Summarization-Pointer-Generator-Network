The bargain beaches of Bali lead Cape Town and Sri Lanka are the best value winter sun escapes for Britons this year, according to a new survey.

Despite price swings for tourists in many countries, the Indonesian island province and South Africa's 'Mother City' have remained steady over the past 12 months, according to the annual Post Office Travel Money survey.

A basket of 10 items, including an evening meal for two, will cost just £40 in Bali this winter, a nine per cent drop due to the weak Indonesian rupiah, the study of long-haul destinations showed.

The items surveyed, also including cup of filter coffee, bottle of local lager, can or bottle of Coca-Cola, glass of wine, cocktail at a bar, a chocolate bar, bottle of mineral water, sun cream from a supermarket and insect repellent, cost £47 in Cape Town where the South African rand has fallen.

In Sri Lanka, which has moved up to third from fifth place in the same survey last year, the same items cost just under £50.

These figures are less than a third of the most expensive locations with the 10 items costing £161 in Dubai, where prices have skyrocketed to make it the most expensive of the 34 destinations reviewed. 

Dubai prices for the items have risen 64 per cent since last year while Singapore (£155), Auckland in New Zealand (£133) and Muscat in Oman (£126) are also at the priciest end of the spectrum.

Sri Lanka has moved from fifth to third in the poll

While a three-course meal for two with a bottle of wine was just £27 in Bali, it would set a couple back nearly £114 in Singapore and more than £99 in Dubai.

The survey, in conjunction with holiday company Travelbag, showed that in the last 12 months the long-haul destinations where the local currency has fallen most against the pound were Gambia, South Africa, Jamaica and Japan.

Prices in resorts have fallen the most in Costa Rica, followed by Japan, Gambia, Mauritius and China.

But as well as the hike in costs in Dubai, prices have gone up in a number of other resorts, with hefty increases in Antigua (up 48 per cent), Muscat (up 48 per cent) and Vietnam (up 39 per cent).

Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'It all adds up to a polarised picture for UK holidaymakers. On the one hand there are great savings to be made in popular long haul resorts and tourists will be 'quids in'.

'On the other, people who make the wrong destination choice could fall victim to much increased resort prices and find themselves out of pocket.'

Former best value destination Sri Lanka recorded a nine per cent fall in prices due to a drop in prices in local resort areas. 

The strength of the pound sees the introduction of four new entrants in  the Long Haul Report top 10, with Tokyo moving to eighth, Mauritius to ninth and Tobago, the cheapest of six Caribbean islands surveyed at £72, sneaking into the top 10. 

Perhaps the bargain of the year is Tamarindo in Costa Rica, where tourist staples have almost halved since 2013 to be £56.

Travelbag's Rianne Ojeh said there has been a significant rise in demand for destinations such as Sri Lanka, Mauritius and St Lucia, 'where sterling is strong and the cost of living is low'.

'The biggest increase year-on year is for Japan as consumers are recognising that the country is now much better value than in recent years,' Ojeh said. 'Rising prices in Vietnam, Antigua and Dubai haven't yet impacted on demand as we have great value packages for these destinations.'
