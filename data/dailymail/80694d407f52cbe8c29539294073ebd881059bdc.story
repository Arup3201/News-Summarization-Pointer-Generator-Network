Two obese best friends who dubbed themselves the 'Funny Fat Friends' have gone from being big eaters to man-eaters - after losing 15 stone between them.

Lianne Jennings, 27, and Karley Slade, 34, had spent years on a daily intake of chocolate, crisps and McDonald's takeways.

The friends from Essex, used to hide their misery at being overweight with jokes, but finally decided to slim down by undergoing life-changing gastric surgery .

Network Rail worker Lianne lives with her boyfriend of two years Charlie Johnson, 23, in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire.

She spent Â£7,500 having a gastric sleeve fitted, which left her with no appetite and a thumb-sized stomach, and she immediately swapped her two daily McDonald's trips for salads, losing five stone in five months, from 16st 7lbs to 11st 6lbs.

Her best friend Karley, a tutor assessor, who was eternally single, once tipped the scales at 18 stone.

She used to plough around 
8,000 calories into her body daily - more than four times the 
recommended amount for a woman - by eating a dozen packets of crisps and
 15 chocolate bars.

But after getting a gastric band fitted she has slimmed down to a healthy nine stone, and found love with a new boyfriend.

Lianne said: 'We were both well greedy. That's it, we were greedy girls.

'I spent so many years miserable. Only Karley knew just how sad I was, because she felt the same.

'I lived for food. When I'd be munching on my McDonald's breakfast I'd be thinking about what large meal I'd get for lunch.

Karley was a size 26, and says her dresses 'could be used as a tent for a family of four'

'When I got home in the evening, I'd quickly munch my way through a jumbo chocolate bar, and then hide the wrapper from my boyfriend so when he came home I could tell him I hadn't had any chocolate.

'Then I'd eat another massive chocolate 
bar, before tucking into a huge dinner.

'Now I eat healthy fruit for 
breakfast, have a salad for lunch, and some fish or chicken with 
vegetables for dinner.

'My chocolate and sugar cravings are completely gone now. I've never felt better - and I've never been happier.'

Karley said: 'I'm at my target weight now, and I'm very happy to be a size 8. I used to be a size 26 - so my dresses could be used as a tent for a family of four.

'I get loads of attention from blokes now - before they used to do all they could to avoid me, but I was a pretty big obstacle for them to walk round.

'I couldn't be happier. Lianne has helped me every step of the way. We've helped each other, really.

'I don't think one of us could have done it without the other. We're not the Funny Fat Friends any more. Now we're sophisticated.'

The girls, who have been best friends for around seven years, still go out every weekend.

Lianne said: 'We always got told that it was "so funny" we could drink like men.

'Shots, pints of wine, vodka. You name it we would drink it. It all seems a bit daft now.

'But ultimately, we were always told that we were too intimidating or unapproachable.

'Now we could be from TOWIE. Before, a truck wouldn't have been able to tow us away from a buffet.'
