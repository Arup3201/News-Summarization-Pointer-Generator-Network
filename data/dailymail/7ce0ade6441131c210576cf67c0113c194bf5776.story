Speaking on camera for the first time since she was shot in the head in January, Gabrielle Giffords says she feels 'pretty good'.

In a television interview set to air in the U.S. next week, the congresswoman admits she found rehabilitation 'difficult'.

The 41-year-old speaks clearly and smiles broadly in the preview of an interview with Diane Sawyer to be broadcast on the ABC network on Monday.

A happy Giffords is seen sitting on a sofa next to her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly.

Her brown hair has grown out since it 
was shaved in May for surgery to repair her skull and she was wearing a yellow top with 
gold buttons and dark eyeglasses.

The preview also showed footage of Gifford as she tried to walk again for the first time and how even music helped in her protracted recovery process.

Her mother Gloria Gifford is interviewed and declares her daughter inspirational.

She said: 'I think Gabby's got a message now that exceeds the political one.'

The Arizona Democrat's husband concurs, adding: 'Gabrielle Giffords is too tough to let this beat her.'

Giffords was shot at a public event 
for constituents in Tucson in January. Jared Lee Loughner has been 
charged in the shooting spree that killed six people and wounded 12.

Throughout
this year, Giffords has been in rehabilitation in Houston and has made 
few public appearances in the ten months since she was wounded.

She
was last seen at a ceremony in Washington last month, she awarded her 
husband two medals to honour his 25 years of service with the Navy and 
Nasa.

Kelly, 47, announced his retirement in June. He flew 39 missions in Operation 
Desert Storm and made four trips into space, including commanding the 
last mission of space shuttle Endeavour.

Giffords made a dramatic return to Congress in August on the floor of 
the House of Representatives to vote on raising the nation's debt 
ceiling. She was met 
with thunderous applause.

ABC said its special presentation 
will be broadcast in conjunction with the release on November 15 of a 
memoir by the couple titled, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.

It promises to tell the 'most 
extraordinary story' of how the couple got through the tragedy.
