A drug dealer was caught with £6.5million of heroin in the back of a taxi after being picked up outside the world famous Abbey Road Studios.

Police found the haul, of 22 parcels inside a laundry bag, when they stopped the taxi nearly 200 miles later on the outskirts of Manchester.

Billal Baig, 32, who booked the cab, was today starting an 11 year jail sentence after he was found guilty of being concerned with the supply of heroin.

Taxi passenger Joseph Salmon, 37, admitted possessing heroin with intent to supply and was jailed for eight years at Minshull Street Crown Court.

The court heard that officers from Greater Manchester Police's Tactical Vehicle Intercept Unit stopped a Mercedes E270 private hire taxi on Chester Road in Mere near Manchester at 8.55pm on May 2. 

Twenty two wrapped parcels were found in a large laundry-style bag and bin bag.

Salmon of no fixed address and the taxi driver - who was later released without charge - were arrested.

The parcels were recovered and found to a high-purity heroin.

The taxi driver - who lives in London - told police how his friend, later identified as Baig, had asked him to take a fare from Abbey Road Studios in London to Manchester and back.

Forensic examination of the drivers phone uncovered messages between him and Baig of Isleworth, West London.

The driver complained that the £400 fare was insufficient and Baig told him that he would sort an extra payment from the 'main man.'

Greater Manchester Police's Tactical Vehicle Intercept Unit discovered this laundry bag in the back of the taxi containing heroin with a street value of £6.5 million 

Baig was arrested some weeks later, following numerous enquiries to identify and locate him.

He told police he asked the driver to take Salmon on behalf of another person who he did not know the name of.

Detective Inspector Lee Griffin, said: 'This is one of the single biggest recoveries of drugs in the force's history.

'To prevent such vast quantities of drugs, worth millions of pounds, from flooding the streets, is a massive achievement.

'In one fell swoop we put a huge hole in the drugs supply market and today's sentence reflects great team work from specialist units across the force.

'Both Baig and Salmon have failed to provide any proper account or explanation for their actions and while work is ongoing to fully understand who else is might have been involved at either end - in London or Manchester - today they have been given long prison sentences for their involvement.

'Put very simply, due to the high purity of the heroin and potential for further adulteration, we have halted hundreds of thousands, if not millions of individual street deals from taking place.

'Drugs generally, but heroin particularly, drive other crime, such as thefts, burglaries and robberies, that are committed by people afflicted by addiction.

'This in turn blights communities and we are always working hard to address this scourge on society. If anyone has information about those concerned in the sale or supply of drugs I would encourage them to call us in confidence.'
