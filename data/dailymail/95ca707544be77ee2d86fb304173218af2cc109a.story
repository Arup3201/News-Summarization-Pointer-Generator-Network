These pheasants appear to have found a way to stay off the dinner table - by hiding behind a bush while a shooting party is on the prowl.

The birds were pictured in their secluded resting place in the grounds of Caerhays Castle, in Cornwall.

Across the river was a group of hunters dressed in tweed and flatcaps and wielding shotguns, facing up the hill.

They would have been delighted to spot the pheasants in order to add them to their haul of game.

But instead, the animals rendered themselves invisible by flying behind the shooting party and using a bush for shelter.

The birds later flew off unharmed after watching the oblivious hunters for a while.

We are currently at the height of pheasant season, which runs from September 1 to February 1.

Caerhays is a grade I-listed mock medieval castle built in the early 19th century.

It is home to the Williams family, a dynasty of mine owners who made their fortune during the heyday of Cornish industry.

The estate frequently hosts shooting parties - Shooting Gazette describes it as having 'a well-deserved reputation as one of the finest shoots in Cornwall'.

Caerhays 'delivers a steady stream of excellent pheasants in the finest surroundings', according to the magazine - but on this occasion, the crafty pair pictured were not among them.
