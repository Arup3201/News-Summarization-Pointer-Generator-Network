This is the moment an incredibly cute baby gorilla appeared to collapse in a fit of giggles when an adult started ticking his tummy.

Five-month-old Jengo was being showered with affection by the other gorillas in his enclosure at Leipzig zoo in eastern Germany when one of them reached out and gently prodded him on the ribs.

Displaying an almost human response to the sensation, Jengo's eyes lit up with joy and his mouth broke into a huge grin as the adult gorilla played with him.

Despite his tiny frame, Jengo is not the youngest gorilla in the enclosure after he was joined by a sister named Diara in early March.

The arrival was the cause of much celebration at Leipzig zoo, as it is rare for two babies to be born to the same family group within four months of each other.

The oldest member of Jengo's family to live at the zoo is his grandmother Viringika who, somewhat surprisingly, is one of the baby gorilla's favourite playmates.

Leipzig zoo houses the Wolfgang KÃ¶hler 
Primate Research Center, where researchers are able to study the 
behaviour, perception and communication of apes.

Like
 the other great apes, gorillas share many traits with humans.

They can laugh, grieve, develop strong family bonds, make and use tools, and 
even think about the past and make plans for the future.

Much like humans, Jengo will be considered a child until he reaches puberty around the age of 13.

Although a gorilla's lifespan is around 35 years in the wild, those kept in captivity live into their 50s thanks to a healthier diet, less exposure to disease, and medical treatment constantly at hand.
