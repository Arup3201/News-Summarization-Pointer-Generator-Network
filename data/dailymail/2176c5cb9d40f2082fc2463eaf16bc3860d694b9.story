Both managers admitted they needed to bring in more players after a dire goalless draw.

Here were two teams who have gone through some serious rebuilding over the summer and they are still clearly not the finished product. This game was stilted, stuttering and starved of chances.

Neither Ronald Koeman, in charge at Southampton, and West Bromwich boss Alan Irvine were at the helm of their respective clubs at the end of last season. Both have seen many players leave and they have tried to bring in new faces as replacements.

Ratings from SAM CUNNINGHAM at ST MARY'S 

For much of pre-season, West Brom had only 11 first-team players available. ‘This is a side that’s only been together for the last two weeks,’ said Irvine. ‘Meaningful work was only done in the last few weeks. We want to bring in another couple of players before the transfer window shuts, and they’re at the top end of the pitch, creative players.’

Koeman, who had the heart ripped out of his squad, was of a similar view. ‘The board know what we need and we’re working to bring in one or two players,’ he said. ‘We know that it will be a long season in England. With that you need enough players in quality to bring competition in the squad.’

Irvine was the happier of the two managers with his point away from home, but it is a long season ahead. The passages of play were disjointed and passes went astray. Strikers were not on the same wavelength as the wingers who were providing crosses.

It was not until the 37th minute that there was a real chance of note. Dusan Tadic, one of the Saints’ new faces, blocked Saido Berahino’s clearance on the left of the area. The ball spilled to Steven Davis who nodded it back to Tadic. From a tight angle on the left, the Serbian tested West Brom keeper Ben Foster with a low shot with the outside of his boot which was pushed wide by the diving goalkeeper.

Just after the half-hour mark, the hosts really should have opened the scoring. A mix-up between Andre Wisdom, brought in by Irvine on loan from Liverpool, and Foster allowed Tadic to nick the ball. The West Brom goalkeeper was stranded on the left but when Tadic swung in a cross it was too high for Southampton’s 6ft 4ins new striker, Graziano Pelle, with the goal gaping. Put former Saints Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert into that scenario and it would surely have resulted in a goal.

Italian Pelle, signed from Koeman’s former club Feyenoord for £8million, has some way to go to fill the boots of Lambert. While the England striker is known for his cool finishing and bullet headers, Pelle headed a chance wildly off target in the opening 10 minutes and then failed to connect properly with a low ball from Ryan Bertrand, yet another loan player.

Southampton fans will have been disappointed their side could not capitalise on a strong performance on the opening day against Liverpool, but if it is any consolation it took Koeman until the fourth league game of the last campaign for his first win at Feyenoord — they lost the other three — and they finished runners-up in the Dutch league.

Albion finally came alive when Irvine brought on new boy Brown Ideye in the 52nd minute.

He had only been on for 60 seconds when Sebastien Pocognoli sent in a deep, looping cross from the left and the striker rose highest at the back post but, from two yards, he headed wide.

This was a player Irvine admitted he had not seen play in the flesh when Albion signed him from Dynamo Kiev for £10m.

He would not have enjoyed seeing him squander that chance but he must have been pleased with his later lively contributions. On 73 minutes the Nigerian skilfully took the ball on the turn to free himself one-on-one, but Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster rushed out to block.

Southampton’s James Ward-Prowse clipped in a good free kick from just outside the area that hit the outside of a post, but still neither side could break the deadlock. Judging by this match, both managers have plenty of work to do before the transfer window shuts.
