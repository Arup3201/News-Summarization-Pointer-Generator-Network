A former Royal Marine killed fighting Islamic State extremists was last night described as a ‘one-man army’ who was ‘very angry about the Middle East’.

Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, 25, was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli.

He is believed to have flown to the region after becoming horrified by atrocities carried out by IS and his fellow fighters said he was the first to volunteer for ambushes and assaults.

The Marine’s family, who live in a detached former farmhouse in Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, were devastated at being told of his death on Monday.

In a statement, they said: ‘His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.’

Last night video footage emerged of the Afghanistan veteran in Syria wearing combat gear, jeans and a black T-shirt.

Speaking to the camera he says: ‘My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.’

It also emerged that he was questioned by police last October on suspicion of going to Syria to fight jihadists.

He was preparing to fly from the US to Turkey after contacting a Kurdish group on Facebook.

He was returned to his unit in Arbroath, Scotland, but decided to leave the Armed Forces before Christmas so he could travel to the war-torn region to fight. 

Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine.

He had been training with the US Marines in California when he made email contact with a Kurdish group and arranged to travel to the frontline.

But he was stopped while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, a now well-known jumping off point for Syria, in October and questioned by the American authorities.

His one-way ticket rang ‘alarm bells’, officials said, and his luggage, phone and laptop were examined.

The Marine, who was known to be outraged by the atrocities committed by the fanatics of Islamic State, was also questioned by police on arrival in the UK and then returned to his unit, 45 Commando, in Arbroath, Scotland.

It is believed he left the Royal Marines just weeks later.

Mr Scurfield, known as Kosta to his comrades, is the first Briton to be killed while fighting Islamic State in Syria. 

The former drama student, who had ambitions to become an actor before joining the Royal Marines aged 21, was described by his comrades as ‘Kosta’s one-man army’ who raised the morale of fighters.

John Foxx, who served alongside him in a team of foreign fighters nicknamed the Chappies, said: ‘He was hands down one of the greatest human beings I have ever met.

‘From beginning to end he was 100 per cent about helping everyone else.

‘No matter what the issue was or who you were he would try to help you however he could.’

Last night a fellow Royal Marine said: ‘He was very angry about the Middle East and the Islamic State.

‘As a unit we had been on standby several times but nothing happened and he was frustrated that the UK was standing back.

‘He was a very focused and good Marine, but the Islamic State was his priority.’

While back in the unit he became ‘tired of seeing what IS were doing to people’, and decided to quit to join the Kurdish Peshmerga after befriending fighters in the region on Facebook.

Mr Scurfield left his UK base in November, telling his parents and three siblings that he was going to provide ‘medical and humanitarian support’ as an expert in battlefield medicine.

But last night details emerged from soldiers fighting on the frontline in Syria that painted Mr Scurfield as a hardened warrior desperate to help the Kurds defeat jihadists. 

'We are devastated to confirm the death of our son Konstandinos Erik Scurfield in Syria where he went to support the forces opposing Islamic State.

'His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.' 

Mr Foxx added: ‘He would always volunteer to be on the ambush team, spend the night on the berm [defence fortification] or go on any assault.’

Jordan Matson, a former US soldier also fighting with the Kurds, paid tribute on Facebook to Mr Scurfield, describing him as a ‘disciplined warrior’.

He added: ‘Kosta volunteered for every attack and guard duty opportunity. He wanted nothing more than to bring the fight to the enemy.’

 In recent weeks his father, archaeologist Christopher Scurfield, and his mother Vasiliki – a writer and teacher – became increasingly concerned and contacted their MP for help.

The Lions Of Rojava boast: 'It is better to live one day as a Lion that a thousand days as a sheep.'

They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria to fight, not for jihad, but on behalf of the Kurdish communities who are defending their communities from the advance of Sunni Islamists.

Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds.

Jordan Matson, the former U.S. soldier now with Syrian Kurds' People's Protection Units (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight.

Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora.

Last August a hairdresser from South London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. 

Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance. 

Dan Jarvis, Labour MP for Barnsley Central, said: ‘They came to me a few weeks ago very worried for their son’s safety and tragically it appears their worst fears have been realised.’

He said the young man had been ‘horrified by the atrocities carried out by IS’.

Mark Campbell, a pro-Kurdish rights campaigner, who broke the news to the family, said: ‘It was very, very emotional, she was literally in tears for the whole conversation.’

He said the Peshmerga wanted to bury Mr Scurfield as ‘one of their comrades in arms, as a hero’.

The Royal Marines were understood to have been ‘upset’ that he had chosen to fight with the Kurds rather than the British military.

David Cameron’s official spokesman yesterday warned against British nationals travelling to Syria to fight.
