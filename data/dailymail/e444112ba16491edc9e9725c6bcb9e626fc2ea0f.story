An Australian company may have found the solution to one of the nation's most annoying summer-time problems - the thong blow-out.

Thongs, also known as flip-flops and jandals, have existed in various guises since the ancient Egyptians in 1,500 B.C.

But only now has a proper fix for the all-too-common blow-out - when the Y-shaped strap slips through the sole of the shoe - reportedly been found.

And the public seem pretty certain that the solution will work as they've already coughed up over $13,000 to help a start-up fund the shoe's production. With $10,000 of Willi Footwear's $30,000 goal being raised in just one hour.

An Australian company may have found the solution to the summer-time problem

Taking on global king of thongs Brazilian company Havaianas, the Gold Coast based company have developed 'patented boomerang plugs' that they promise won't pull through the sole, unless you want them to.

If you want to change the colour of your thongs, the straps and bases are interchangeable allowing for a number of different colour combinations.

Willi Footwear's crowdfunding page on IndieGoGo.com says it is raising money to get its product on the shelves of Australia's leading retailers 'with a goal to have them available in the US Market and other countries around the world'.

So far the five guys behind the company have designed, developed, tested and patented the product.

Now they are asking for help to raise $30,000 to use for the production run, molds, patent fee's, shipping and logistics.

Willi Footwear found Brad Munro is the man behind the 'boomerang' strap idea

Willis Footwear have tested the boomerang straps and now want the money to bring the thongs to shops across Australia and eventually the world

A donation of $25 will give you one pair of thongs and a pair of straps, plus free delivery in Australia, USA and Canada.

The donation packages range in cost - right up to $4,999 for the most serious of thong lovers.

For this amount, donators will get to spend a weekend away with the owners of Willi Footwear in the Gold Coast, including a limousine ride, hotel on the beach, dinner and a helicopter ride. Plus 20 pairs of thongs.

The thong straps and thong base can reportedly be changed to mix and match colour combinations in less than 30 seconds

The thongs have been plugged on social media and Willi Footwear raised $10,000 in just one hour of crowdfunding

Crowdfunding - funding a project or venture by raising money from a large number of people - has existed for centuries. In 1783, Mozart used it to raise money to perform three concertos in a Viennese concert hall. In exchange for backing this effort, he offered manuscripts of the concertos.

However, since the boom of crowdfunding websites it has become an especially common way for entrepreneurs and start-ups to financially back their projects.

There are two different types: equity based crowdfunding, where investors receive a share in the company, and reward based crowdfunding where investors receive a product or service.

A May 2014 report, released by The Crowdfunding Centre in the UK showed that during March 2014, more than $60,000 US was raised on an hourly basis via crowdfunding websites.

The most successful crowdfunded project to date is Star Citizen, an online space trading and combat video game.

By July 2014 funding surpassed $48 million, according to developer Chris Roberts.
