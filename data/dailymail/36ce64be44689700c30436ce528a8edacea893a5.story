It's every gambler's dream - landing the jackpot because a casino dealer forgets to shuffle the cards.

And it happened for a group of lucky mini-baccarat players in April who will walk away with around $1.5 million after winning a controversial lawsuit over their claim to the cash.

14 players cashed in more than $550,000 in chips, but the Golden Nugget casino in Atlantic City was refusing to pay off the remaining $1 million.

They found themselves embroiled in a court battle with casino chiefs following their impossibly lucky night on the table.

Back in April the 14 players stuck lucky when they realised that the cards weren't being shuffled properly, leading to the same sequence of cards was being dished out.

They took advantage of the oversight, which went unnoticed by casino staffers, and slowly increased their bets over 41 consecutive winning hands.

Casino bosses filed a lawsuit against the players, argued that the rogue deck gave them an unfair advantage, which they strongly disputed.

'I wasn’t cheating,' one of the gamblers, 51-year-old Michael Cho told the Washington Post. 'I didn’t do anything illegal. It wasn’t right for them to get the money.

'Anybody could see [that the cards weren't shuffled] — that was the dream we all look for. We took a chance on every hand we bet, that it wouldn’t change.

'We didn’t know if it was going to change. That’s called gambling.'

udge James Isman sided with the players, ruling that it was the Golden Nugget's responsibility to ensure the cards were properly shuffled.

'There is no clear and convincing, real evidence that there were unlawful actions,' he said.

Acceptance: Tilman Fertitta, owner of the Golden Nugget Atlantic City, said he will not appeal the court ruling

'I don’t consider this to be a rigged game. There is no proof that the players obtained those chips unlawfully.'

The ruling provoked an angry response from the casino but owner and billionaire Tilman Fertitta said he will not take the case any further.

'Without question, the mini-baccarat game that took place on April 30, 2012, allowed $10 bettors to realize a gambler’s dream and enabled them to beat the house out of $1.5 million.'

'Even though we can appeal the court’s ruling and take full advantage of the appellate process and legal system, and tie the matter up in litigation for a number of years, the Golden Nugget is a people business.

'It is prepared to allow the gamblers — most of whom continue to gamble at Golden Nugget — to realize the gambler’s dream of beating the house.'
