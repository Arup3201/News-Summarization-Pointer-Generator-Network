Emergency crews have launched a search for a man they fear may be missing in the Severn Estuary.

Swansea Coastguard began looking for the man this morning when the man's empty boat was found on the St Pierre Pill, near Chepstow in South Wales.

The boat's owner is known to have been on board doing some work yesterday evening.

But the alarm was raised shortly before 11am when he failed to meet a friend earlier this morning.

It is believed that the man was the only person to have been on board the vessel.

Coastguards and the Severn Area Rescue Association have joined the search operation.

A spokesman for Swansea Coastguard said that search efforts are 'ongoing'.

The St Pierre Pill overlooks the second Severn Bridge and is an anchorage for boats on the nearby estuary.

It is also the base for the Chepstow and District Yacht Club.

Meanwhile in Theale near Reading, a major search is underway for a fisherman who went missing near a riverbank.

The man, who is in his 60s, sparked a land and helicopter search after unattended fishing equipment was discovered close to the River Kennet on Friday night.

A police helicopter used thermal imaging equipment in the search for the man, who has still not been found.

Crew manager John Murby for the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'The water rescue unit searched the river and we were there to assist them and carry out a bank search.

'Police dogs and the police helicopter were also out there.

'There was some fishing gear that had been left unattended, and we searched up and down stream, but weren't able to find the man in the river.'

Thames Valley Police confirmed officers are still searching for a missing man, amid fears that he may have fallen into the icy water.
