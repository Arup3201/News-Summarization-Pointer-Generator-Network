This shows the  split second before the nine-year-old girl shoots Charles Vacca in the head. She appears to have lost her double handed grip on the Uzi as it recoils after firing

Just hours after a nine-year girl accidentally shot and killed her gun instructor, the National Rifle Association tweeted ‘7 ways children can have fun at the shooting range’.

The 'ill-timed' tweet posted by NRA Women, which linked to an article on Women’s Outdoor News, was deleted without an apology or explanation.

It has been criticised as ‘tasteless’, as the article was shared less than two days after a young girl in Arizona lost control of a sub-machine gun, striking 39-year-old Charles Vacca.

A shocking recording from the Bullets and Burgers shooting range in White Hills, Arizona, shows the moment the nine-year-old girl shot Mr Vacca with an Uzi on Monday.

The video, taken by the girl's parents and released by police, shows Mr Vacca standing closely next to the girl when the gun recoiled as she fired on full automatic mode.

His last words to the girl are: 'Alright, full auto.'

The nation's largest gun lobby has now come under fire for posting a ‘tasteless’ tweet on Wednesday, so soon after this accident.

In the article, parents are encouraged to introduce different types of targets to engage young shooters who have grown bored with the standard bull's-eye.

Mutants and zombie targets are among those suggested, with author Mia Anstine saying: ‘We’re not sure if they will frighten young children, or if they can imagine they’re getting rid of the monsters from their nightmares. Regardless, they do look like lots of fun.’

The article itself is dated August 20, five days before the tragic Arizona shooting, which occurred at a popular shooting range near Las Vegas.

People have taken to social media to criticise the NRA's ill-timed tweet.

The tweet was posted by NRA Women at 4.51pm on August 27, just hours after the shooting on August 25

Charles Vacca, a father and veteran from Lake Havasu City, Arizona, teaches the 9-year-old girl how to handle the Uzi at the Bullets and Burgers shooting range in White Hills, Arizona

Director at Equality Missouri, Aaron Malin, tweeted: 'This is not the best timing'.

Mark Follman said: 'In the wake of the horrible Arizona Uzi killing, the NRA tweets about 7 ways for kids to have fun at the gun range'. 

Vicky Baker said: 'These are not enough words to describe how insensitive this is.'

Sarah Felstead tweeted: 'This is incredibly tasteless. Could there be worse timing?'

In the video of the accident, Mr Vacca is seen  instructing the girl to hold the weapon with two hands at all times and to take a perpendicular stance to the target. 

Then Mr Vacca asks her to fire one shot for him, which she does. 

He then tells the girl to adjust her stance and squeeze the trigger to let off a volley, but something goes wrong when she fires a second time.

The girl loses her two-handed grip on the weapon and it pulls to her left, striking Mr Vacca in the head.

Charles Vacca,  a staff sergeant, passed away on Monday night after helping a nine-year-old at a shooting range

The Israeli-made submachine gun can fire almost 30 rounds per second, according to the manufacturer.

Mr Vaca from Lake Havasu City, Arizona, was airlifted to hospital on Monday morning after the little girl shot him but died that evening.  

Mohave County Sheriff Jim McCabe said the full video of the incident was 'ghastly'. 

He said that the girl had successfully fired the weapon several times before when it was set on 'single shot' mode.

However, the horrific accident unfolded in a split second when the Israeli made weapon was set to 'full-automatic mode' and caused Mr Vacca his fatal injuries. 

'The guy just dropped,' Mr McCabe said of the former soldier, who suffered more than one gunshot to the head.

Mr McCabe told the Las Vegas Review Journal that no charges will be filed because Bullets and Burgers is licensed and legal as an operation. 

The nine-year-old girl, who has not been identified, was not injured. She was with her parents as they passed through the area on vacation from New Jersey.

The range operator at Bullets and Burgers told KLAS-TV he was shocked by the incident. 

'We really don't know what happened. Our guys are trained to basically hover over people when they're shooting. If they're shooting right-handed, we have our right-hand behind them ready to push the weapon out of the way. And if they're left-handed, the same thing,' operator Sam Scarmardo said.
