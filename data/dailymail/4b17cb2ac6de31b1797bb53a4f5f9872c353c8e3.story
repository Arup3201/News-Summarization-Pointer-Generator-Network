The eyes of a turkey are not the most obvious place to look for sadness, empathy and pride.

But these moving images show the dignified twilights of farm animals who made it through most of their natural lifespan to reach old age.

The selection of images, showing animals as young as five and as old as 33, were taken taken by photographer Isa Leshko, and often involved spending hours with the animals before they would be comfortable enough with her to pose for the photographs. 

Her project, which was also compiled into a video, was dreamed up as a way to cope with the deaths of her grandmother and mother, who both suffered from dementia.

She said: 'I am creating these photographs in order to take an unflinching look at aging and mortality. ... Photographing geriatric animals enables me to immerse myself in my fear of growing old. I have come to realize that these images are self-portraits.

'Or at the very least, they are manifestations of my fears and hopes about what I will be like when I am old.'

Dignified: The images, by photographer Isa Leshko, are a stark depiction of old age in the animals. Left is Marino, a five-year-old turkey, and right in Pumpkin a 28-year-old Morab horse

Deep: The animals depicted have a steady gaze and powerful stare in common. Picture is Cecil, a goat whose age was not clear

Death's door: This age of the above rooster, whose wings have lost almost all their feathers, was not clear at the time of the photograph

Stillness: Violet, the twelve-year-old pot-bellied pig above, lay down for her portrait

Seen better days: Phyllis the sheep, 13, has only patchy wool to form her coat - but could still slowly move around this yard

Glazed: Red, this cross-bred Chow Chow dog, aged 14, also took a sedentary position and seems to not be looking quite at Leshko

Sadness: Kelly, the 11-year-old Irish wolfhound in the picture above, sports an inquiring gaze

Sleepy: Teresa, a Yorkshire pig who has lived to 13, barely opened an eye for the intimate portraits by Leshko

Oldest of the bunch: Handsome One, the thoroughbred horse above, was 33 years old when the above photograph was shot

Thin feathers: Ash, an eight-year-old domestic white turkey, has limited coating on his neck and wings thanks to the march of time

Seen a lot: Abe, a 21-year-old Alpine goat, keeps a proud and upright stance as he looks into the distance from this photograph

Holding up: Blue, this Australian kelpie, is nineteen years old in the above photograph. Leshko says the images were born of seeing her own grandmother and mother suffer from dementia

Leshko said she would spend hours with each animal - and imagined series as a way to confront her own old age
