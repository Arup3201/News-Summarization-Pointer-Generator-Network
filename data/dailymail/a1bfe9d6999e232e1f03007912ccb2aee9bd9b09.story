Hidden wealth: Ronald Read died last year at age 92. The frugal gas station attendant had secretly accumulated a $6 million fortune through canny investments and in his will left it to his local Vermont library and hospital 

A Vermont man who sometimes held his coat together with safety pins and had a long-time habit of foraging for firewood also had a hidden talent for picking stocks — a talent that became public after his death when he bequeathed $6 million to his local library and hospital.

The investments made by Ronald Read, a former gas station employee and janitor who died last June at age 92, 'grew substantially' over the years, said his attorney Laurie Rowell.

Rowell said that Read's entire fortune added up to around $8 million.

He also left behind a 2007 Toyota Yaris valued at $5,000.

For almost 25 years Read worked at Haviland's service station. 

He retired but got bored and decided to work for JCPenny until 1997.

Read, who was known for his flannel jacket and baseball cap,  gave no hint of the size of his fortune.

'He was unbelievably frugal,' Rowell said on Wednesday. 

When Read visited her office, 'sometimes he parked so far away so he wouldn't have to pay the meter.'

The bequest of $4.8 million to the Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and $1.2 million to the town's Brooks Memorial Library were the largest each institution has ever received.  

Read also made a number of smaller bequests.

'It's pretty incredible. This is not something that happens on a regular basis,' said the hospital's development director, Gina Pattison.

In addition to cash, he had an antique Edison phonograph with dozens of recording drums that he left to the Dummerston Historical Society, Rowell said.

'It's really a beautiful machine,' said Historical Society president Muriel Taylor.

Read was born in Dummerston in 1921. 

He was the first in his family to graduate from high school, walking and hitchhiking about four miles each way from his home to the high school in Brattleboro. 

After military service during World War II, he returned to Brattleboro where he worked at a service station for 25 years then worked for 17 years as a janitor at the local J.C. Penney.

Gas station employee: Ronald  Read worked at Haviland's service station for 25 years and even met his wife there in 1960 for whom he was married for 10 years until she died in 1970 

In 1960 he married a woman he met at the service station but she died in 1970.

Stepson Phillip Brown, of Somersworth, New Hampshire, told the Brattleboro Reformer he visited Read every few months, more often as Read's health declined. 

The only indication Brown had of Read's investments was his regular reading of the Wall Street Journal.

'I was tremendously surprised,' Brown said of Read's hidden wealth. 'He was a hard worker, but I don't think anybody had an idea that he was a multi-millionaire.'

It's unclear as to if Read gave any of his fortune to his stepson.

Reformer.com reports that each institution was extremely grateful for their large financial gifts and said they never expected such a large donation from a man they knew so little about.

'This bequest is incredible. It's transformative,' Brooks Memorial Library Executive Director Jerry Carbone said. 

'It's going to really provide for our future and relevance in the community and allow us to keep up with the times, and keep up with what this community needs to access quality library services.'

Carbone said that Read wasn't well known at the library but over the past six or seven years he had been quietly coming in to read and take out books.

Read's attorney said that her modest client had his two favorite hobbies which were investing in stocks and cutting wood.

Huge donation: Ronald Read gave $1.2 million to the town's Brooks Memorial Library,  the largest donation the institution ever received

'He had two lifelong hobbies: Investing and cutting wood,' she said. 

'The generous bequests to the Brooks Library and Brattleboro Memorial Hospital attest to his skills at investing. The well-stocked woodpile in his garage attests to his love of cutting wood.'

His step-son Philip Brown said Read was cutting his own firewood well into his 90s, and the two would often drive around looking for downed wood Read could throw in the truck and take home for his wood stove.

Other Vermont residents had no idea that Read had the money he did and even assumed he might be down on his luck. 

'People were stunned that he had that much money,' resident Ruth Marx said. 

'I bought some old fence wiring from him once because I thought he could use the money.'

Marx even once knitted him a hat for fear he might need it to get through the winter.
