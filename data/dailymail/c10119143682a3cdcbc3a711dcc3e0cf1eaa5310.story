You know the look, don't you. Their eyes glaze over, they look over your shoulder for a distraction and before long you're in a one-way conversation to nowhere.

What is it about reliving holiday experiences which makes even best friends and family fail to take an interest - and us feel all the poorer for it? 

A new paper by Harvard University called The Unforeseen Costs Of Extraordinary Experience claims to have worked it out.

Psychologists have proved once and for all that having superior experiences will make people dislike you

Psychologists Gus Cooney, Daniel T. Gilbert and Timothy D. Wilson found that we seek out extraordinary experiences; from yachting with celebrities off the coast of St Tropez, to climbing mountains, detoxing in exotic spas and sampling rare wines.

More importantly, though, while we thoroughly enjoy having these superior experiences to our peers,  the feeling is spoiled by subsequent conversations with them which ultimately leave us feeling worse than if we had a more ordinary, relate-able trip.

The reason? Uncommon experiences make us at once 'alien and enviable' and leave you feeling left out. The Harvard scientists proved the theory with tests on lots of small groups of people. 

Harvard: Paper was published by the University and called The Unforeseen Costs of Extraordinary Experience

In each case one person was given an amusing video clip of a talented street magician to watch while others a low budget animation.

Researchers told everyone whether they were getting the average or better footage then asked them to rate how happy they felt directly after watching it. 

The group reassembled and and chatted for some time about whatever they wanted. After that, they were asked to rate their happiness again. 

The results were, in a nutshell, those who'd watched the premium video felt immediately happier but after speaking to their peers felt excluded and a lot worse than those who had seen the cartoon.  

How to lose friends and alienate people? Tell them how brilliant your yachting holiday to St Tropez  was

Those who had the mundane experience were united by it and enjoyed sharing common ground making them happier overall.

'At worst, people may be envious and resentful of those who have had an extraordinary experience, and at best, they may find themselves with little to talk about,' wrote the paper's authors.

As leading psychologist Cooney paraphrases: 'If an experience turns you into someone who has nothing in common with others, then no matter how good it was, it won't make you happy in the long run.'  

Helicopter skiing might make an incredible trip but talking about it will alienate people and make them envious

An abstract from the paper reads: 'People seek extraordinary experiences - from drinking rare wines and taking exotic vacations to jumping from airplanes and shaking hands with celebrities.

'But are such experiences worth having? 

'We found that participants thoroughly enjoyed having experiences that were superior to those had by their peers, but that having had such experiences spoiled their subsequent social interactions and ultimately left them feeling worse than they would have felt if they had had an ordinary experience instead. 

'Participants were able to predict the benefits of having an extraordinary experience but were unable to predict the costs. 

'These studies suggest that people may pay a surprising price for the experiences they covet most.'
