No further police action: Former Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard was accused of behaving inappropriately towards a number of women

Former Liberal Democrat chief executive Lord Rennard said facing sexual harassment claims has been ‘harrowing and deeply unpleasant’ and he is ‘not surprised’ that he will face no criminal charges.

The peer thanked political colleagues for their ‘unfailing support’ after allegations were made earlier this year by women party activists.

Scotland Yard did not name the peer but said tonight that there was insufficient evidence to support a prosecution against a 52-year-old man.

He was accused of behaving inappropriately towards a number of women in the party but repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Lord Rennard said: ‘I am not surprised by the police decision that after a full investigation into the complaints made against me I will face no charges.

‘The last eight months have been harrowing and deeply unpleasant for me, my wife Ann, my family and friends.

‘I am enormously thankful for the unfailing support I have received from people across the political spectrum but especially those within the Liberal Democrats who have stood by me throughout.

‘My life's work has been to support good people and good causes. I hope now to be able to continue doing that.’

Making a decision: Scotland Yard said tonight that there was insufficient evidence to support a prosecution

Scotland Yard said that officers had 
‘early investigative consultation’ with the Crown Prosecution Service 
but that it was a police decision to take no further action.

The
 force said: ‘Following reports in the media in February, officers from 
the Specialist Crime and Operations Command launched an investigation 
into allegations of sexual touching.

‘Various
 inquiries were conducted - including meeting with officials from the 
Liberal Democrat party - and a number of individuals were spoken to as 
part of the investigation.

‘Those
 inquiries have now concluded that there is insufficient evidence to 
support a prosecution; a decision which has been made by police.’

Lord Rennard was interviewed under caution in June after he voluntarily went to a police station in south London.

Scotland Yard said it was agreed from the beginning that any internal misconduct issues would be referred back to the Lib Dems.

A
 Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ‘The decision by the police not to 
prosecute Lord Rennard with a criminal offence means that the party's 
disciplinary process, led by Alistair Webster QC, can now resume.

‘We
 consider the allegations made against Lord Rennard, which he 
strenuously denies, to be extremely serious and we can now continue with
 our internal inquiry into these allegations.

‘We would encourage anyone who has information that could be relevant to the inquiry to get in touch.’

Deputy
 Prime Minister Nick Clegg and two other Lib Dem ministers - Danny 
Alexander and Jo Swinson - were sharply criticised in a review of the 
party's handling of the complaints made against Lord Rennard.

Businesswoman
 Helena Morrissey, who conducted the inquiry, said that there should 
have been a formal investigation launched when his accusers first came 
forward.

In February it 
emerged that a number of woman activists and party workers had made 
allegations of unwanted advances, but when they reported the claims 
little action was taken.
