A visibly angry Sen. John McCain grilled the head of America's border patrol on Wednesday over a policy that limits what members of Congress can do at detention facilities where the government is holding thousands of illegal immigrant children.

'I have never seen anything like your instructions, signed by your name. ... Are you telling me that [when] I visit a detention facility, that I can't bring a cell phone with me?' the Republican asked. 'Are you saying that? ... I am not allowed to take photographs?'

'I want it fixed immediately! Understand?' McCain boomed at Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske.

Angry: Arizona Republican Senator John McCain ripped into the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol commissioner on Wednesday for refusing to let members of Congress tour detention facilities with their cell phones

Defensive: CBP Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske (L) insisted that thousands of illegal immigrant children have 'a right to privacy,' even where senators are concerned

Deplorable: The photo that launched a thousand news articles: Breitbart.com obtained the first leaked photos from inside a Homeland Security holding facility where hundreds of illegal immigrant children languished in squalid conditions

The policy, called an 'Interim Protocol for Visitation and Tours,' requires all visitors to turn over their phones and restricts contact with the detained children and staff members.

McCain ripped into Kerlikowske for applying the rules to him even though the Nogales, Arizona facility is in the state he represents.

'People from Arizona elected me, and I'm not supposed to even carry a cell phone with me?' he demanded. 'Mister, you have overstepped your responsibilities and your authority.'

'I want those instructions revoked, as far as members of Congress are concerned, and I want it done today.'

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, was embarrassed in June when Breitbart.com published the first leaked photos showing the inside of then-secret facilities where thousands of children were being held after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally and alone.

The images showed overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, and immediately turned the flood of children into the U.S. southwest into a national controversy.

Since 
then, CBP has allowed Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar to take pictures 
inside a facility in southern Texas. The images showed children tightly 
packed in small rooms, often using sheets made of foil for warmth.

No Republican lawmaker has been permitted to take such photographs.

MailOnline has also published exclusive photos showing children streaming in and out of the Nogales facility.

Foil blankets: Reuters got rare pictures from inside the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Nogales Placement Center, but MailOnline has learned that the photographer was shadowed by a government official who controlled what was photographed

Fate unknown: Thousands of child detainees live and sleep in crowded holding cells until a relative can be found to claim them; DHS told MailOnline that no effort is made to determine whether the adult guardians are themselves in the U.S. illegally

Secrets: This photo, taken from a security video monitor in May, shows the fate of underage Central Americans when they enter the United States

The Reuters news agency was permitted to take rare pictures inside the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Nogales Placement Center, but MailOnline has learned that the photographer was shadowed by a government official who controlled what was photographed.

On Wednesday McCain also ripped into Kerlikowske for a policy that restricts 'physical or verbal contact' with children and staff at holding facilities.

The commissioner offered to make 'special arrangements' but defended the policy.

During a June visit to the Nogales facility, McCain was told not to speak with children or staff.

'I view that as a violation of my responsibilities,' he said.

'I want it fixed, and I want it fixed immediately. Understand?'
