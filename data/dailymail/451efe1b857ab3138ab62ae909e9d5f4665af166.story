Astronomers have discovered the biggest spiral galaxy yet seen - and say it may be now giving birth to a new, smaller galaxy thanks to a collision with another.

The spectacular barred spiral galaxy NGC 6872 has ranked among the biggest stellar systems for decades, but a new analysis has know crowned it the largest known spiral.

Measuring tip-to-tip across its two out-sized spiral arms, NGC 6872 spans more than 522,000 light years - more than five times bigger than the Milky Way.

Giving birth: A previously unsuspected tidal 
dwarf galaxy candidate (circled) appears only in the ultraviolet off the
north-west arm of NGC 6872 , indicating the presence of many hot young 
stars. IC 4970, the small disc galaxy interacting with NGC 6872, is located above the spiral's central region

And a comparatively recent collision with another galaxy may now be causing one outer arm of the spiral to spawn fresh stars that may eventually break away into new galaxy.

A team of astronomers from Brazil, Chile and the U.S. made the new findings based on an examination of archival data from Nasa's Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite.

'Without GALEX's ability to detect the ultraviolet light of the youngest, hottest stars, we would never have recognized the full extent of this intriguing system,' said lead scientist Rafael Eufrasio.

He presented the findings Thursday at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Long Beach, California. 

Six new comets described as 'a missing link' of the formation of planets, have been spotted in other star systems.

The discovery more than doubles the number of comets known outside the home solar system and suggests they are just as common as planets.

The comets, or exocomets as they are called when in other solar systems, are left over from a time when planets were forming.

Most comets that were formed around a star would have been absorbed by new planets the ones that can be seen now are thought to be left over – the cosmic equivalent of builders’ rubble.

Finding new exocomets is thought to be a clue to astronomers that a star is likely to have planets orbiting it.

The galaxy's unusual size and 
appearance stem from its interaction with a much smaller disk galaxy 
named IC 4970, which has only about one-fifth the mass of NGC 6872.

The odd couple is located 212million light-years from Earth in the southern constellation Pavo.

Astronomers think large galaxies, including our own, grew through mergers and acquisitions - assembling over billions of years by absorbing numerous smaller systems.

Intriguingly, the gravitational interaction of NGC 6872 and IC 4970 may have done the opposite, spawning what may develop into a new small galaxy.

'The northeastern arm of NGC 6872 is the most disturbed and is rippling with star formation, but at its far end, visible only in the ultraviolet, is an object that appears to be a tidal dwarf galaxy similar to those seen in other interacting systems,' said team member Duilia de Mello, a professor of astronomy at Catholic University.

The tidal dwarf candidate is brighter in the ultraviolet than other regions of the galaxy, a sign it bears a rich supply of hot young stars less than 200million years old.

The researchers studied the galaxy across the spectrum using archival data from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, the Two Micron All Sky Survey, and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, as well as GALEX.

By analysing the distribution of energy by wavelength, the team uncovered a distinct pattern of stellar age along the galaxy's two prominent spiral arms.

The youngest stars appear in the far end of the northwestern arm, within the tidal dwarf candidate, and stellar ages skew progressively older toward the galaxy's centre.

The southwestern arm displays the same pattern, which is likely connected to waves of star formation triggered by the galactic encounter.

Cosmic collision: Simulations show how 
the collision between NGC 6872 and IC 4970 produced the features 
of the galaxies as we see them today. IC 4970's closest encounter occurred 130million years ago and the smaller galaxy followed a path (dashed curve) close to the plane of the spiral's disc and in the same direction it rotates

A 2007 study by Cathy Horellou at Onsala Space Observatory in Sweden and Baerbel Koribalski of the Australia National Telescope Facility developed computer simulations of the collision that reproduced the overall appearance of the system as we see it today.

According to the closest match, IC 4970 made its closest approach about 130million years ago and followed a path that took it nearly along the plane of the spiral's disk in the same direction it rotates.

As in all barred spirals, NGC 6872 contains a stellar bar component that transitions between the spiral arms and the galaxy's central regions.

Measuring about 26,000 light years in radius, or about twice the average length found in nearby barred spirals, it is a bar that befits a giant galaxy.

The team found no sign of recent star formation along the bar, which indicates it formed at least a few billion years ago.

Its aged stars provide a fossil record of the galaxy's stellar population before the encounter with IC 4970 stirred things up.

'Understanding the structure and dynamics of nearby interacting systems like this one brings us a step closer to placing these events into their proper cosmological context, paving the way to decoding what we find in younger, more distant systems,' said team member and Goddard astrophysicist Eli Dwek.
