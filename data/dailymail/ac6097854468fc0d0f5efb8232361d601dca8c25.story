Dressed in his finest tuxedo and flanked by 200 of the world's sharpest businesswomen, it looked like Prince Harry's lucky night at a west London charity gala this evening. 

But despite his best efforts, the 30-year-old prince drew the short straw at the fundraising event, after being seated between two of the only other men in attendance. 

Never the martyr, the Royal poked fun at his luck during a speech to thank 100 Women in Hedge Funds, the organisation which hosted the gala dinner to raise money for WellChild, the national sick children's charity at Royal Hospital Chelsea.

Prince Harry was joined by some of the world's leading businesswomen at the fundraising event at Royal Hospital Chelsea this evening 

'Thank you all very much for coming this evening.

'I am not entirely sure who made the seating plan but I am sitting between two men.

'I thought it would just be 100 women and myself,' he said to rapturous laughter.  

Harry, who is a patron of WellChild - the national charity for seriously ill children and their families - then remarked on the 'Harry Potter-esque' dinner location.

'It is great to see you in this rather wonderful Harry Potter-esque setting. There will be no Quidditch.

'This hospital represents the importance which society places on the care of those less fortunate than ourselves.

'In the case of the Royal Hospital it is former members of the Armed Forces but for WellChild it is children and young people.

'I am incredibly proud to be the patron of WellChild, the charity being championed by 100 Women in Hedge Fund's UK this year.

'I am also delighted to be patron of 100 Women in Hedge Fund's philanthropic initiatives for this year also.'

The 30-year-old joked at somehow ending up seated next to two men while delivering his speech 

During his speech to the event's guests he joked at not being sat among the many women present 

Harry was the only member of the Royal Family in attendance, being patron to both the charity and organisation of businesswomen 

He described WellChild as a 'truly remarkable charity' whose staff and nurses 'work tirelessly to make sure that thousands of seriously ill children and young people received the very best possible care'.

He added: 'This work is invaluable to the people they care for and their families.'

Upon his arrival, he spoke with CEO of WellChild and asked of the family of , Laughlin Whiteley, a seven-year-old boy who died this week. 

The child spent time with Prince Harry at a recent awards ceremony.  

'He was just asking how the family were and saying how sad it was,' said Colin Dyer, CEO of the charity. 

'It's only a couple of weeks ago that we were all together at the WellChild awards.' 

Amanda Pullinger, CEO of 100 WHF, said: '100 Women in Hedge Funds is proud to continue its support of the Charities Forum of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry with its gala this evening.

'This year's beneficiary is WellChild, which does an incredible job in the service of children and families across the UK.

Upon his arrival Prince Harry greeted guests in tuxedos and ball gowns and spoke of a child he recently worked with through the charity who has died 

The prince attended the event alone this evening at Royal Hospital Chelsea in west London

'I know that their work is close to the hearts of many of our members, who have been instrumental in our fundraising efforts throughout 2014.' 

Earlier this week Prince Harry paid tribute to his late mother while honouring a different charity set up in her name to deter bullying.

In a joint statement with his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, he praised the Diana Award which was set up 15 years ago.  

'We believe, when encouraged and supported, that young people have the ability to change society for the better.

'We know that our mother - in whose memory this award was established - felt the same and would be proud of its achievements to date.'
