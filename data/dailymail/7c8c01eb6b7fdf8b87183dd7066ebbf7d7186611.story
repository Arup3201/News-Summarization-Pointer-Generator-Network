Superscrimpers host Heather McGregor said clothes shopping is the biggest vice on which women waste their cash

Any woman searching for a solution to her financial woes need look no further than her own wardrobe, according to a financial expert.

Heather McGregor – better known as television's Mrs Moneypenny – said clothes shopping is the biggest vice on which women waste their cash.

She recommended going on a 'clothes diet' for six months, under which fashion purchases are banned.

The host of Channel 4 show Superscrimpers also advises women to hold Boden parties, use what's already in their larder and ditch all household cleaning products for basic bicarbonate of soda.

Mrs McGregor, 52, opened up about her money-saving tips at Henley Literary Festival, supported by the Daily Mail. She said: 'I suggest to people that they go on a clothes diet. It's just like being on a normal diet. Because what women fritter away money on actually is clothes.

'Basically you walk past a clothes shop and you think I can't go in there because I'm on a clothes diet. I made a few rules for myself – it didn't include underwear or tights. You genuinely notice what you might have bought just because it was there rather than [because it was] what you need. Now I'm much better about buying just stuff I need.'

Mrs McGregor, a mother-of-three, who also runs a headhunting company and writes a weekly column in the Financial Times, also said hosting Boden parties – the middle-class equivalent of Avon parties – not only provided her with extra cash but free clothes for her children.

She said: 'Boden sent scented candles, they sent the coffee. I earned £700 commission that day. And you either have a cheque for £700 or I could have one and a half times that in credit. I dressed my children for free for 18 months just by tidying up a bit, clearing up my house and putting on Johnny Boden's posh coffee.'

To avoid overspending on food, always have a list and never go to the supermarket hungry, she said.

She added: 'We audited someone's larder once and found £1,000 worth of stuff in it. I write a shopping list, then I go into the larder and see which of the things on the list I already have and cross it all off.'

Mrs McGregor, who was promoting her latest book, Mrs Moneypenny's Financial Advice for Independent Women, said it was important women did not hand responsibility for their finances to men. Instead they should spend an hour a week writing down every aspect of their spending – from credit cards, to mortgages, to phone bills.

She said too many women relied on men – their father, husband or bank manager – to control their finances, adding: 'It's about taking back that information.'
