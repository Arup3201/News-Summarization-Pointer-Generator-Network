For nearly 200 years she is rumoured to have haunted the corridors of Hampton Court.

But now the ghost of the famous Grey Lady may finally have been captured on camera - by a schoolgirl and her iPhone.

Holly Hampsheir, 12, thought she was taking a fairly routine photo of her cousin Brook McGee, also 12, during a day out at the 16th century stately home.

But she appears unwittingly to have captured the spectral figure of Dame Sybil Penn who looms over the schoolgirl as her back is turned.

With flowing dark hair and a full length black gown the woman seems real enough in the picture.

But seconds later Brook turns around and the next image in the series shows no sign of the visitor at all.

The girls didn’t realise what they had encountered at the time and only made the terrifying discovery when looking through their photos of the outing a day later.

Miss McGee, from Hornchurch, Havering, told the Sun: ‘I was totally freaked out.

‘I didn’t see anything.

‘People say the room goes cold when ghosts appear but we had no idea.

‘We haven’t slept properly since.’

Dame Sybil died from after contracting smallpox in 1562.

The camera clearly picks up some distortion in the right hand image which is missing in the left.��

Sightings of the ghost were first reported in 1829, although several other spirits haunt the historic building

Soon after strange noises of a person working a spinning wheel were apparently heard through a wall at Hampton Court.

They led to the discovery of a previously unknown chamber containing an antique spinning wheel.
