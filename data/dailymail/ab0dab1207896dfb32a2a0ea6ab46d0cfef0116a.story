Respected: David Mockett stood up to 'bully boys' he suspected of fraudulently claiming they had been attacked

A British marine expert blown up in a car bomb attack was murdered by a fraud gang who had claimed Somali pirates attacked their ship, an inquest heard yesterday.

David Mockett, 65, was working for a shipping company when he died in a car bomb explosion in Yemen almost a year ago.

His death was ordered by a gang running a scam making fraudulent insurance claims for ships apparently attacked by Somali pirates, the hearing was told.

Mr Mockett had stood up to the 'bully boy' gang but was later killed because of his investigation into their tanker, it was claimed.

The inquest in Plymouth, Devon, heard that he had survived another attempt on his life in 2001, which was believed to have been linked to his work.

The father-of-two, who was employed as a marine shipping surveyor and consultant, had grave doubts about one insurance claim.

The hearing was told that Mr Mockett doubted that an oil tanker, the Brillante Virtuoso, had come under attack from Somali pirates armed with guns and grenades.

Mr Mockett's widow, Cynthia, 66, told the inquest that part of her husband's work was assessing insurance claims submitted by owners and agents.

'The last job David did before his death was to survey a ship called the Brillante Virtuoso, an oil tanker which had allegedly been attacked by Somalian pirates,' she said in a written statement.

'The ship was anchored about 20 miles off the Yemen coast to the south of Aden.

'In an email David sent to the agent of the ship, which he sent a copy to me with photographs, David states he could not find evidence of bullet holes or from explosions from grenades.

'After David's death I had a conversation with a friend of David's and mine, John Murphy, who informed me that he believed that David had been killed because of his involvement in investigating the Brillante Virtuoso.

'John told me that he believed there had been two other ships with the same captain that had been in the Brillante Virtuoso and that these two ships had been allegedly attacked by Somalian pirates and the salvage company involved was the same for all three ships, which is unusual.'

The Gulf of Aden is one of the busiest maritime corridors in the world and handles around 20% of world trade.

Blast: Mr Mockett was killed by a TNT bomb which was planted under this car in Yemen last year

Mrs Mockett, who lives in Plympton, Plymouth, said her husband of 44 years felt safe in Yemen even though he was working in a very dangerous country.

'While living in Yemen David never checked under his vehicle as he did not feel threatened even though he had been the victim of a shooting incident in 2001,' she said.

The inquest was told that Mr Mockett, who was born in Kent but grew up overseas and in Plymouth, died on July 20 last year in the TNT-packed car bomb, which had been placed under his car.

After leaving school at 16 he had joined the Merchant Navy but left after 15 years' service having risen to the rank of captain.

Mr Mockett then worked in the Middle East in shipping and when he died he was employed by Arabian Marine Surveyors Ltd.

The inquest heard that Mr Mockett's Lexus car exploded a few minutes after he had left his hotel in Aden.

He died almost instantly from blast injuries and was later formally identified by dental records.

Detective Superintendent Jonathan Tottman, a member of the Metropolitan Police's anti-terrorist department based at New Scotland Yard, investigated Mr Mockett's death because he was on attachment to Oman and Yemen.

Mr Tottman said the Yemeni authorities had investigated Mr Mockett's death very thoroughly and they believed criminals were responsible, rather than terrorists.

Mr Mockett's inquest heard that noone in Yemen has been brought to justice for his death

'In countries where there is no government, terrorists, as well as criminal gangs, fill the void,' the officer said.

'I think it is fair to say they felt this was a criminally motivated act.

Mr Tottman said that he supported Mrs Mockett's view that gangs involved in shipping insurance scams were responsible.

'It seems like this was a scam where a lot of money was being made in what we call 'insurance jobs',' he said.

'I suspect this was the motivation.

'David, being a man of great integrity and professionalism, wasn't going to bow to some bully boys tactics.'

The inquest heard that no-one in Yemen had been brought to justice for Mr Mockett's death.

Ian Arrow, the Coroner for Plymouth and South West Devon, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.
