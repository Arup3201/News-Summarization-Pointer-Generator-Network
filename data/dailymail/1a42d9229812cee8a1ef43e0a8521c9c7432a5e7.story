Spooked pub staff believe their bar is haunted by the ghost of a former drinker who recently died - after its bell appeared to signal last orders by itself.

Bar workers believe the spirit of Nigel Harris, 64, is ringing time from beyond the grave at Exmouth Rugby Club in Devon.

They say the last order bell has been sounding unmanned and believe Mr Harris, a popular customer of 30 years who recently passed away, is haunting them.

Bar manager Frank Bright of the Exmouth Rugby Club in Devon, believes the rugby club bar is haunted as the bell behind his bar keeps ringing

Eerie: Staff, pictured in this CCTV image, in the clubhouse at Exmouth Rugby Club in Devon were left spooked by the bar bell to calling time

One incident was captured on the 
clubhouse CCTV camera but when bosses rewound the tape they couldn't see
 any evidence of a prank.

Barmaid Tasmyn Burns, 19, was serving pints when the bell rang out on a Sunday afternoon.

She said: 'It made us all jump because it was ringing so loud. It was really being yanked with some force. 

'I thought someone may have been playing a joke or something so I was shocked when I saw no one else was there.

'I don't normally believe in ghosts 
but it's quite hard not to after what happened. I have heard a few 
whispers of peoples saying it could be the spirit of Nigel.

'He was always in the bar and he did everything with the club, his picture is even hanging up in the lounge'.

The video is the latest in a string of intermittent incidents which could indicate the presence of a spectre

Spooked: Exmouth Rugby Club, where the strange goings on happened

The bell at the bar of Exmouth Rugby Club in Devon which staff believe is haunted as it keeps ringing itself

Mr Harris, the club's former 
secretary, died from a heart attack in 2010 after being involved with 
the rugby team for three decades.

Bosses had planned to bestow an honorary lifetime membership on him but he died before they could do it.

Manager Frank Bright said: 'A few 
people have mentioned Nigel's name. He was great man, an all-round good 
guy - and certainly no threat to anyone.'

'The bell ringing on its own is pretty odd, I'll give you that,' he said. 'And one of the girls was quite freaked out.

'But I'm a bit more level-headed and I'm sure there's some way to explain it; I just can't put my finger on it at the moment.

'There
 was one time I was here on my own and I heard a whistle. I turned round
 and shouted "hello, hello" but there was no-one here.

'You hear voices every now and then but it could just be someone outside. The walls are made of wood but pretty thin.

'Maybe we could use it to our benefit - £25 a night to stay in the haunted bar, how does that sound?'

The
 rugby club's events manager Sue Stone added: 'I've seen the video and 
it looks pretty genuine but I'm no expert on these things.

'I know the bar staff have said they've heard things in the past and it's certainly strange.'
