When Wang Wu was thrown out and banned from the local Mahjong club, that set of a chain of events that resulted in him jumping out of a building - only for him to survive and get arrested.

Wang, 39, was barred from the club in Heyuan city in southeast Guangdong province after arguing with other players.

When owner Dewei Chang, 47, refused to back him in the row, told him he was ‘being too aggressive’, and showed him the door, Wu returned with a knife.

Standoff: Mahjong fan Wu Wang, 39, stabbed game bar owner Chang Dewei, 47, to death in Heyuan city in southeast China

Making threats: Wu killed Mr Chang with a kitchen knife, fled the scene and was tracked down to his flat where he threatened to jump to his death

Thwarted: After a one-hour long standoff Wu jumped, but thanks to quick action from emergency services, he landed on a giant inflatable cushion

Mr Chang was stabbed to death at the bar, and Wu fled the scene, leaving the weapon behind.

When
 police turned up at his flat to arrest him, Wu began threatening to 
kill himself, and there was a one-hour standoff at the building.

Eventually,
 firemen managed to set up a giant inflatable cushion below the flat, 
which the desperate man tried to avoid as he tried to leap past it to 
his death.

Fire brigade 
spokesman Yi Sung said: ‘When he jumped, officers were able to pull it a
 meter to one side, and it was enough to catch him and prevent serious 
injury.’
