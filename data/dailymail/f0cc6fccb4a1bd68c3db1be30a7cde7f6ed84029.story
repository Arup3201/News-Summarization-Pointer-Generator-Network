 

A war is being waged in a Massachusetts town over the word Christmas. 

A rift first appeared in the town of Marshfield earlier this year when the schools voted to change the name of Christmas vacation to 'holiday break.'

On Saturday, that rift deepened when the Department of Public Works was asked to take down a flashing roadside sign that read 'Merry Christmas to all. In God we trust.'

Townspeople in Marshfield, Massachusetts defiantly took to the streets in holiday garb Saturday to wave handmade signs proclaiming 'Merry Christmas' to passersby after city officials forced the removal of a roadside sign that read 'Merry Christmas to all - In God we trust'

War on Christmas: The local Department of Public Works union posted the sign and said it was merely an innocent gesture

A group soon took to the streets while decked out in holiday garb and elf costumes where they waved 'Merry Christmas' signs and wished passersby a happy holiday.

The sign was placed there by public works employee and local union chairman Steve Barber, who called the sign 'perfectly innocent.'

'We’re the guys who take care of the town, and we’re proud of it,' Barber told the Patriot Ledger. 'We just wanted to decorate and wish everyone a Merry Christmas.'

Supporters of the sign, most of whom were against the September measure to change the name of Christmas vacation, went public with their outrage after city officials had the sign removed. 

'This is America the last time I looked,' one Marshfield bus driver told WBZ. 'We were founded on Christianity and it seems to me like Christianity is starting to be wiped out. It’s the melting pot. Melt and merge.'

She was among those proudly holding signs that read 'Merry Christmas' over the weekend, as was Laurie Futch, who told My Fox Boston:

'This is America, right? It's up to the individual. If you want to say "Merry Christmas," you should be able to. If you want to say "Happy holidays," then say it.' 

In November, a special meeting of the Marshfield was held to address the change of their winter break name from Christmas vacation to holiday break.

Too politically correct? The protesters say a war is being waged on Christmas in their town and point to a recent school board vote to change the name of Christmas vacation to holiday break to prove it

'This is America, right?': Residents of the town of 24,000 who want to bring the word Christmas back, like Laurie Futch, say their rights are being taken away. 'It's up to the individual,' Futch said

Even when nearly a fifth of the city's 24,000 residents signed a petition asking that the name be changed back, the board voted the request down.

Elaine Taylor, who presented the 4,000-plus signatures to the committee, told WBZ:

'Some people have other holy days on their calendars because that’s their community and what they believe...But our community is Christian, and we should be able to hold on to those traditions.'
