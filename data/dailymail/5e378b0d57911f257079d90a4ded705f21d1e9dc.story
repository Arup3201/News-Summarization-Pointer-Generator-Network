If you’ve ever played with Lego, chances are you’ve attempted to build a freestanding tower of bricks.

But while yours probably toppled only inches from the ground, a team of Lego constructors recently built a tower that reached a world record-breaking 114ft (34.76 metres).

It was constructed in front of Saint Stephen's Basilica in Budapest and was topped off with a Lego version of a Rubik’s Cube.

The 114ft (34.76 metre) tower (pictured) was built in front of Saint Stephen's Basilica in Budapest. It beat the previous world record of 112ft (34.34 metres) - set in Delaware last year. The completed tower consisted of 450,000 bricks

In December, members of the Tsukuba Lego Circle in Japan built a modern-day version of the 1980s game, Screwball Scramble. 

Called the Lego Great Ball Contraption, the mechanical device contained around 11,000 bricks.

It was made up of modules submitted by various members of a Japanese Lego fan club.

One of the largest stretches was built by 22-year-old Kawaguchi Akiyuki from Shimane.

He built 17 of the modules using around 3,000 bricks.

Pneumatic arms, robotic scoops and conveyor belts move the balls around. 

The team of builders, from the Lego Store Budapest, now hold the Guinness World Record for The Tallest Structure Built with Interlocking Plastic Bricks.

Their tower beat the previous record of 112ft 11inches (34.43 metres) set by students in Delaware last August.

The Budapest tower was made using 450,000 bricks and tapered towards the top to give it more stability. 

To claim the record, the tower was also freestanding, and not supported in anyway by structures or adhesive.

Wires were used during the construction to stop the tower from toppling into a crowd that had gathered to watch, but once the final piece was put in place, the wires were removed.

The tower took four days to build and the record was verified at the weekend.

The mayor of the city's 5th district said he hoped the record would promote Budapest to the world, before he was lifted on a crane to the top of the tower to place the last piece.

‘This is a modern obelisk behind us and it shows that with lots of minute engineering knowledge and diligence how we can call attention to the fact that this is one of the most beautiful squares of Budapest,' Mayor Antal Rogan said.

'I hope we will be able to achieve a new world record, and if it happens we will be able to draw even more tourists to [the region].

The tower was disassembled the day after.
