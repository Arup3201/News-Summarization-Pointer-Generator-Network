A massive underground ocean on Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is as salty as the Earth's Dead Sea, it has been revealed.

Nasa scientists analyzing data from the Cassini mission say the have firm evidence the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts.

They say the density of the oceans mean they are are salty as the Dead Sea.

Researchers found that Titan's ice shell, which overlies a very salty ocean, varies in thickness around the moon, suggesting the crust is in the process of becoming rigid. Nasa scientists analyzing data from the Cassini mission say the have firm evidence the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts.

Using the Cassini data, researchers presented a model structure for Titan, resulting in an improved understanding of the structure of the moon's outer ice shell.

Researchers found that a relatively high density was required for Titan's ocean in order to explain the gravity data.

This indicates the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts likely composed of sulfur, sodium and potassium.

The density indicated for this brine would give the ocean a salt content roughly equal to the saltiest bodies of water on Earth.

It is believed the ocean is made of sulfur, sodium and potassium.

The new results come from a study of gravity and topography data collected during Cassini's repeated flybys of Titan during the past 10 years.

Using the Cassini data, researchers presented a model structure for Titan, resulting in an improved understanding of the structure of the moon's outer ice shell.

The findings are published in this week’s edition of the journal Icarus.

'Titan continues to prove itself as an endlessly fascinating world, and with our long-lived Cassini spacecraft, we’re unlocking new mysteries as fast as we solve old ones,' said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who was not involved in the study.

The salt content allows the bathers to read while floating effortlessly in the Dead Sea, Jordan Valley. Experts say the underground ocean on Titan would be similar.

Additional findings support previous indications the moon's icy shell is rigid and in the process of freezing solid.

'This is an extremely salty ocean by Earth standards,' said the paper's lead author, Giuseppe Mitri of the University of Nantes in France.

'Knowing this may change the way we view this ocean as a possible abode for present-day life, but conditions might have been very different there in the past.'

Cassini data also indicate the thickness of Titan's ice crust varies slightly from place to place.

The researchers said this can best be explained if the moon's outer shell is stiff, as would be the case if the ocean were slowly crystalizing, and turning to ice.

This image provided by NASA is a recent photo from the Cassini spacecraft showing planet Saturn, and if you look very closely between its wing-like rings, upper left, reveals a faint pinprick of light. That tiny dot is Earth.

Otherwise, the moon's shape would tend to even itself out over time, like warm candle wax.

This freezing process would have important implications for the habitability of Titan's ocean, as it would limit the ability of materials to exchange between the surface and the ocean.

A further consequence of a rigid ice shell, according to the study, is any outgassing of methane into Titan's atmosphere must happen at scattered 'hot spots' -- like the hot spot on Earth that gave rise to the Hawaiian Island chain.
