The firm hoped the system would make it easier for touchscreen users, and is the same across Microsoft's phones, tablets and PCs.

However, many users were confused, and Microsoft recently reinstated the classic start menu on its desktop.

‘Let’s make it easier to start applications in the way we are used to,’ boss Steve Ballmer told its annual Build developer conference, to cheers from the audience.

‘We will bring back the start button, and you can boot straight to the desktop if you want to.’

‘We have refined the blend of our desktop experience and our modern app experience.’

Ballmer also said the firm was not abandoning its start menu and said it was slowly beginning to attract app developers to Windows 8.

‘Within this month we’ll pass the 100,000 app mark in the Windows store,’ said Ballmer.

Flipboard, Facebook and the NFL all revealed new apps.

However, the latest rumours suggest Microsoft will allow these apps to run on the desktop.
