The bizarre story of Adam Muema, the NFL prospect who mysteriously went missing last month and spent three days at a Florida airport, has taken a turn for the even more outlandish after a shadowy figure claiming to be the second coming of Jesus Christ tweeted that the player’s actions had been ‘foretold by Torah Code prophecy.’

Muema, 21, left the NFL Scouting Combine in Florida before running any drills because, he said, God told him to in order to fulfill his dream to play for the Seattle Seahawks.

In an attempt this week to explain his peculiar behavior, the player has revealed that he communicates with God via numbers and believes that the self-anointed Lord RayEl is God.

Muema has spent the past couple of days tweeting and positing about his devotion to RayEl, who he calls God

It was RayEl who on Saturday tweeted that Muema’s decision was foretold and included a link to a YouTube video which supposedly explain the so-called prophecy. The polar vortex is another recent event which Ray-El claims was foretold.

On his Facebook page, Lord RayEl grandly proclaims himself as ‘The Returned Christ, Lord RayEl, also known as The Messiah, Yeshua to the Jews, Isa to the Muslims, and Jesus to the Christians.’

Over the last couple of days, Muema has tweeted and posted messages on Facebook and Instagram about Lord RayEl , who he refers to as God.

One post reads ‘I have joined with an UNSTOPPABLE forced who remains victorious Christ Jesus, Yeshua, Lord RAYEL, God, Jehovah, I AM.’

In another he post he rewrote the lyrics to Lil Wayne's song Gossip in praise of RayEl.

'Suit up and lace ya boots up its war time. R-A-Y E-L Tha Mes-siah. Confirmed by the Holy Spirit, so there's no science. Coming straight from the dome no trying & I know He the Truth, no lying.’

Born Raymond Elwood, RayEl declared himself the Messiah three years ago. He communicates with his followers through YouTube videos and a website where he asks his followers for donations.

Until recently Muema was considered 
an exciting NFL prospect after becoming the fourth leading 
rusher in San Diego State University history.

He was initially expected to be a mid- to late-round draft pick, but his stock has plummeted following his bizarre explanation for the combine no-show.

On
 Saturday Muema posted a rambling and incoherent explanation of his non-appearance and revealed that he had gone to church instead.

Muema, 21, left the NFL Scouting Combine in Florida before running any drills because, he said, God told him he would fulfill his dream to play for the Seattle Seahawks if he did so

‘Okay here’s is the Seahawks #8 story. I was given #8 the first time playing football started to love this number. I was wondering if I could be 8 in the NFL & he said go to the store to decorate your living space.

'Went to the Christian store lady says when did that get in & didn’t let her grab it & said it was for me. Later, I ditch the combine to go to the saturday service & speaker was GM for Seahawks. I was honored by the Rev for being the 1st out of 8 yrs to go to this service, I cried :)

'If I would of performed that day I would of missed that meaningful #8. Glory be to God. Keep calling them coincidences if you want to.’

Muema appears so convinced that Seattle will draft him that he has spent hundreds of dollars to decorate his home in Seahawks gear.

Adam Muema has previously said that he speaks to God through numbers and that the Lord told him to leave the combine on Sunday for the benefit of his career

He also believes he can see the future and has tweeted a prediction about tornadoes in California and that his dad recently dreamed of a tsunami.

Muema tweeted both Lord RayEl and Idaho State defensive back Brandon Golden (@goldenbg4) to in form them that he is a prophet.

‘My Lord as I said & your God if you make the right decision,’ he wrote on Instagram on Sunday. ‘I’m a prophet like I told @goldenbg4.’

Muema has been dropped by his agent, and having skipped the combine, is unlikely to be selected without participating in San Diego's March 19 pro day, which he also believes he needs to skip in order to fulfill his Seahawks prophecy.
