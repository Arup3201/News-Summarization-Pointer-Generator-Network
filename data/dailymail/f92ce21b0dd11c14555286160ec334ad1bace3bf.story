A care home owner has been found guilty of 26 charges of historical sex abuse against children who lived in his residential properties.

John Allen, 73, of Needham Market, Ipswich,was convicted by a jury at Mold Crown Court of committing various sexual offences at a number of care homes in and around the Wrexham area.

He was found guilty of 21 counts of indecent assault, one charge of indecency with a child and four serious sex assaults. He was cleared of two other serious sexual assaults.

John Allen, 73, has been convicted at Mold Crown Court of committing 26 sexual offences at a number of care homes he owned in and around the Wrexham area - the jury will deliberate ona further 12 counts tomorrow

The jury is continuing to deliberate on a further 12 counts.

Opening the case, prosecutor Eleanor Laws QC, said Allen created 'a sexualised atmosphere alongside a culture of fear'.

Ms Laws said Allen employed staff to look after the children, but involved himself in some of the work duties including working at the homes at night and was 'a regular and formidable presence'.

Miss Laws said boys at the homes described Allen as being 'abusive' and said at times he was violent and was often under the influence of alcohol.

She told the court the victims felt they had 'no choice' but to put up with Allen's attentions as they became 'hardened to the abuse'.

Giving evidence during the trial, Allen claimed he had no sexual interest in young boys and said he thought the complainants were after compensation in the wake of the publicity of his previous convictions.

The jury was told that Allen was convicted in 1996 of indecently assaulting six boys, aged between 12 and 16, at his care homes in the 1970s

Allen claims that conviction was 'a miscarriage of justice'.

Allen has denied 29 counts of indecent assault, nine other serious sexual assaults and two counts of indecency with a child, on various dates between the late 1960s and 1990.

The case was adjourned until tomorrow when the jury will return to resume its deliberations.
