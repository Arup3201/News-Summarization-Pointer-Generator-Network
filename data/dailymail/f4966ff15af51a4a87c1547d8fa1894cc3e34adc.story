Matthew Hayes, 12, died after being hit by a bus on Friday

The sister of a schoolboy who died after being hit by a bus has left a moving tribute to her 'baby' brother at the spot he was killed.

Matthew Hayes, 12, died near a busy supermarket at Ryhope Street South in the city on Friday afternoon.

His sister Rehanna left a note on the roadside for her 'baby brother'.

'Words can't describe how much I'm missing you,' she wrote.

'I shouldn't be writing this, it shouldn't be like this, 12-year-old, my baby brother, it doesn't seem real.'

Her moving letter described their family life together in Moorside in the Wyatt area of Sunderland, playing computer games, play-fighting, watching TV and running around the house with Nerf guns.

'I'm physically heartbroken,' Rehanna wrote.

'I'm trying to stay strong for mam and dad but I just can't get it into my head that you're gone.

'I'm glad I gave you a hug and a kiss before you went to school on Friday, I could have been a better sister to you and for that I am so, so sorry.

'I honestly love you more than anything in the world.'The sister described how on Christmas Eve 2000 - the day Matthew was born - the family allowed her to pick his name.

'I just need you to come and tell me everything's alright, but it's not.

'I can't believe this has happened,' the letter read.

'I know you'll always be with us. I remember when we used to fight over who got to hold you; this shouldn't be like this.

'RIP baby and sleep tight, we'll see you soon. I love you so much words cannot describe it.'

Matthew's family also paid tribute to him in a statement released by Northumbria Police.

'We would like to thank all the people who tried to save Matthew's life on Friday,' they said.

'We know there were a lot of people at the scene, including Matthew's schoolfriends, members of the public and all the emergency services. We know everyone did their best to try and save Matthew.'
