A bowling alley faces $45,000 in fines after an employee died when his hooded sweatshirt became tangled in a pin-setting machine during repair work.

Northwest Lanes in Fairfield, Ohio was cited for eight violations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration following the death of 53-year-old maintenance worker David Geiger in November.

Mr Geiger, who was married with children and a grandchild, worked at the bowling alley for 30 years.

Mr Geiger's hoodie became trapped in the pin-setting machine at the Ohio bowling alley. Federal investigators called it a 'preventable workplace tragedy'

The Butler County Coroner's Office said in November that Geiger's death was accidental traumatic asphyxia.

The Dayton Daily News reported that the federal agency said the machinery's parts were improperly exposed and lacked proper guards. OSHA called it a 'preventable workplace tragedy'.  

The bowling alley also did not ensure workers were protected from dangerous parts of its 1970s-era equipment, according to OSHA.

Northwest Lanes has requested a conference with the agency after it was slapped with $45,500 in fines.

Daily Mail Online was awaiting comment from Northwest Lanes on Tuesday. 

The bowling alley had no history of workplace violations before Mr Geiger's death. 

Mr Geiger was pulled into the machine on November 7 around 2pm. Dozens of bowlers were inside the alley at the time but no one saw the accident take place. 

The 53-year-old was found by fellow employees after they went looking for him when he stopped responding to his pager.  

The owners of Northwest Lanes previously declined to comment other than to say they were 'very sad and upset'.
