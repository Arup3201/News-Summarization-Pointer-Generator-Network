New England is expected to be hit with storm-force winds and up to 18 inches of snow today, with the latest round of bad weather blasting in before beleaguered residents have had a chance to dig their way out of the last dumping of snow.

A heavy storm warning has been issued for Maine and parts of New Hampshire and Massachusetts north of Boston from this morning through to Saturday night. Residents have been told to travel only in emergencies.

The National Weather Service said drifting snow driven by strong winds could make travel life-threatening. Efforts to clear the 3 feet of snow that fell earlier this week have been put on hold.

Conditions: On Saturday the poor weather shifts West with only the north west tip of Maine suffering snow

Massachusetts resident Bob Tetrault told NBC News that the new storm warning was 'everyone's worst nightmare'. This week's blizzard shattered a seawall and ripped decks from houses in his neighborhood of Marshfield.

Things aren't any better in New York where authorities have issued a 'life threatening' weather warning through to tomorrow evening. 

The New York City Office of Emergency Management said there would be 'dangerously frigid temperatures and life-threatening wind chill'.

Seniors, infants, the homeless and those with chronic medical conditions were said to be at an 'increased risk of health problems', the emergency management office said.

One to two inches of snow was expected to have fallen by this morning and temperatures would plummet throughout the day, with a nighttime low of between -11 (12f) and -13 (10f) degrees with wind chills of '5-10 possible'.

The strongest winds, according to the warning, are expected tonight and tomorrow morning, with sustained wind gusts of 40mph. Those winds will diminish Saturday afternoon, but temperatures would remain 'dangerously frigid'.

Meanwhile, snow resumed falling in Boston last night and major cities south of Boston were warned they would get about 1 to 3 inches of new snow over the weekend.

But for the northern suburbs to the Canadian border up to a foot of snow and gusts of 50mph were expected for eastern Marine area, including Bangor, in what Samantha Mohr, a forecaster for The Weather Channel, said was going to be 'a huge wind event'.  

On Massachusetts' Nantucket island, power had been restored to 92 per cent of customers by Thursday night, but many residents still couldn't get out of their homes.

Nantucket resident Don Van Dyke told NBC News  'it looks like a disaster zone', adding that he had 'never seen it that bad'. 

Predictions: The wintry conditions are set to spread further west and south by Monday with the North East expected to experience the worst of the weather

Winter storm watches have also been posted further to the West for parts of far eastern Arizona and New Mexico.

The Weather Channel forecast suggests the latest band of weather will not be as devastating as the one seen earlier in the week, however it will cause misery for those still clearing snow and fixing flood damage. 

Bill Simpson, a weather service meteorologist, told the Boston Globe: 'It could be a potential horror show again on the roads.'

The mercury is also set to plummet with temperatures in the low 20s for most of the region, falling to single digits at night.

Moving into next week, the snow is set to ease off but it's still expected to be cold with below-freezing temperatures expected for some parts of the region. 

Last week's storm brought heavy snow, hurricane-force winds and coastal flooding - wreaking havoc across a huge swathe of the region, with record-setting snowfall in some parts of Massachusetts.

Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and parts of Long Island, New York, were hit by the fierce storm throughout Tuesday, which wrecked homes, cut power and blasted more than thirty inches of snow. 

The worst-hit state was Massachusetts, where 36inches of snow was recorded in Lunenberg, according to the Weather Channel, while elsewhere blasts of wind topped 75mph.

Frozen over: The winter storm devastated parts of the North East, including Scituate in Massachusetts, earlier this week, dumping up to 30 inches of snow in some places. The huge clean-up operation is ongoing

Devastating: Around 26 inches of snow was dumped on Boston during Juno. Resident David McClaren was forced to shovel the snow out from under his buried car 

In Boston, Juno dumped 26 inches on many streets, with 30mph overnight winds.

The total is two inches shy of the all-time record. In coastal areas of the state, flooding closed roads and sank parked cars under the rising tide of icy water. Marshfield and Scituate, just south of Massachusetts Bay, were struck badly by flooding. Almost 30,000 families were without power at 7pm Tuesday.

The snow abated on Wednesday, giving New Englanders a chance to dig out and return to work.

During the last storm, travel was banned in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Maine and New Hampshire residents were not banned from the roads but were strongly discouraged from leaving their homes.
