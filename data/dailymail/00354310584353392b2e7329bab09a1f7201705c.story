Thousands of celebrities, sports stars and wealthy professionals will be warned today that they face massive bills following a clampdown on tax avoidance schemes.

HM Revenue and Customs  is publishing a list of 1,200 avoidance schemes whose members will be told to pay up within 90 days.

HMRC will identify the schemes only by their serial numbers. However, its list is understood to include the Liberty scheme, reportedly used by a string of high-profile figures including George Michael, Sir Michael Caine and Katie Melua.

The scheme’s 1,600 members are also believed to include business tycoons, lawyers, doctors and other wealthy individuals.

It was wound up in 2009 when a tax loophole was closed, but a test case relating to members’ tax avoidance is not due to be heard until next year.

HMRC’s clampdown is also thought to cover the so-called Icebreaker schemes in which Take That’s Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Howard Donald and manager Jonathan Wild are reported to have invested some £26million.

The taxman believes more than 33,000 individuals and 10,000 companies are members of the schemes being published today. 

Between them they owe an estimated £4.9billion – equal to an average of about £114,000 each, although some are thought to owe millions of pounds in tax.

Members of the schemes will not face criminal charges, but letters will demand they make ‘accelerated payments’. Experts warn that this could force some into bankruptcy.

Tory MP Charlie Elphicke last night welcomed the move, saying the rich should be subject to the same tax laws as everyone else. 

He said members of the public would have little sympathy for wealthy individuals who had tried to avoid paying their fair share. ‘It is quite right that the Revenue is taking the battle to people who are using their wealth to game our tax system,’ Mr Elphicke said. 

‘The behaviour of these people means that hard-working families who do the right thing and pay their taxes have to pay more to support the services we all use.

‘Most people entering these schemes know they are unfair and wrong – they enter these schemes with their eyes wide open.

‘They are taking a gamble on not being caught. What they are doing is unacceptable and wrong.’

The Treasury declined to comment in detail on the individual schemes targeted in the clampdown. 

Using the schemes is not illegal, and many of the members involved say they already pay large sums in tax and have done nothing wrong. However, failure to make payments demanded by HMRC today could result in criminal charges.

HMRC’s decision to publish the list of schemes follows an announcement in the Budget of new rules to make it easier for the taxman to close avoidance schemes.

Accountancy firms are now required by law to reveal details of schemes that may be viewed as tax -avoidance arrangements.

And instead of pursuing each case through the courts for years, HMRC may now issue demands for immediate payment.

David Elliott, a partner at accountants Moore Stephens, said today’s letters were likely to place some individuals in severe difficulty.

He told Accountancy Age: ‘Receiving a demand to make up-front payment of tax could put some taxpayers under financial strain, and in the very worst cases, could even trigger personal bankruptcies or business insolvencies before the technical merits of the arrangement have been tested.

‘Even a remote prospect of being made bankrupt could mean that taxpayers feel under pressure to settle disputed cases rather than take an appeal to the courts.’
