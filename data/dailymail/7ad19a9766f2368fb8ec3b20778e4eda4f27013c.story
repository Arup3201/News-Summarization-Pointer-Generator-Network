who will be truly missed,' said Paul Baruch. 'We ask that you please respect the privacy of his family and friends as this very difficult time.'

Young's body was found at his North Hollywood home by police Monday morning after he failed to show up for work on TNT's crime drama Rizzoli & Isles, police Officer Sally Madera said. The Los Angeles Fire Department was summoned and pronounced him dead at the scene, she said.

LAPD robbery-homicide detectives and the Los Angeles County coroner office were investigating because it is a high-profile death, she said. Madera had no details about the cause of death.

According to TMZ, the actor died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Young's death remains a mystery because he did not leave a suicide note, TMZ reported, and although the actor did have a diary none of the writings explain the reasoning behind him taking his own life.

In addition, Young was last seen on Saturday and law enforcement officials believe that the star may have committed suicide that same day, the website also reported.

Young's death is the second high profile suicide in a week following Bachelor star Gia Allemand's hanging last Monday and subsequent death Wednesday, also at the age of 29.

Young made a name for himself as the title character in Disney's The Famous Jett Jackson, which ran from 1998 to 2001.

He then went on to play running back 
Chris Comer in the 2004 film Friday Night Lights, before landing the lead
role on Rizzoli & Isles for the past three seasons as Boston police
detective Barry Frost.

Earlier Monday, TNT announced it was renewing the series that stars Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander.

'We are beyond heartbroken at the loss of this sweet, gentle, good-hearted, intelligent man. Lee will be cherished and remembered by all who knew and loved him, both on- and offscreen, for his positive energy, infectious smile and soulful grace,' TNT, studio Warner Bros. and series producer Janet Tamaro said in a joint statement.

They sent condolences to his mother and other family members.

According to a biography from TNT, Young was inspired to pursue acting when, at age, 10, he played Martin Luther King Jr. in a play in Young's hometown of Columbia, South Carolina.

Young followed his stint at Disney it with roles in TV series, including The Guardian, Scrubs and Smallville and in the films Akeelah and the Bee and The Hills Have Eyes II. Young joined Rizzoli & Isles when it debuted in 2010.

Young said in 2011 that he valued his start as a child star.

'It's always a really great feeling when I talk to people who watched Jett Jackson, because we were the same age,' he told EW.com. 'We were all kids. I was 13 when I started working on that show and that was part of my childhood. And it's kind of like we have that in common.

'It means a lot to me when people enjoyed it and when it was a part of their childhood,' he added.

'It's cool when you see people revert back for a quick second to middle school, and they're like, "Oh, man! I remember..." It's really great to me that our work is still with people after 10 years.'

Young, a graduate of University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, was an avid photographer, traveler and student of martial arts, according to his biography.
