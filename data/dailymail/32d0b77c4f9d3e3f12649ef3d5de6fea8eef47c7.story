Political first: Carmen McPhee who has become the first UK-born person to be elected as mayor in Spain

A sheep farmer who emigrated from the UK to Spain as a teenager has become the first British-born elected mayor in the country.

Carmen McPhee won a vote to lead the farming village of Villaquejida in the province of León, in north west Spain last week.

But Ms McPhee will have her work cut out leading the 950-strong community which has faced swingeing government spending cuts as a result of the country's well-documented economic crisis.

She told the Daily Telegraph: 'We need to review the whole of the water system and there are many roads here that are still mud tracks.

Born in London and brought up in Luton, Bedfordshire, Ms McPhee is only the second reported British mayor to have taken office in Spain.

She was elected to the region's council as part of the Union of the People of León party in 2011 and went on to become the town's mayor as part of a power-sharing deal with coalition partners last week.

Ms McPhee had a bilingual upbringing as her mother was originally from Villafer in Spain.

She spent her summers in the village, which is located in the municipality of Villaquejida, and eventually moved to begin a new life in Spain as a 19-year-old.

The 45-year-old met her husband Mario Fernandez in Spain and the pair have two daughters, aged 22 and 23.

As well as her political career, Ms McPhee helps the family run a farm of around 800 sheep, whose milk is used to make tangy León cheese.

She is the only British ex-pat in her community and is known to locals as 'Carmen la inglesa' or Carmen the Englishwoman, mainly she says because no one knows how to pronounce her surname.

The only other British-born mayor in Spain, Mark Lewis, took office by default in 2008 in San Fulgenico on the Costa Blanca.

He was made acting mayor when senior councillors were arrested on corruption charges.
