Chris Hughton and Tony Pulis are also in contention to take up the reins at The Amex

Hughton said: ‘Brighton have a wonderful structure and a wonderful stadium, new training facilities, and, of course, they are a side that have been very close to the play-offs in two previous seasons.’

Albion play Fulham on Monday night and will climb out of the relegation zone if they win for the second time in 20 league games. 

It will be caretaker boss Nathan Jones’ second game in charge.
