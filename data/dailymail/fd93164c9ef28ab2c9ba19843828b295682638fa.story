Jurors in the murder trial of a man accused of stabbing a college student to death while he was high on PCP were shown graphic pictures of the bloody crime scene in court yesterday.

Julio Miguel Blanco-Garcia is accused of bringing Vanessa Pham's 'young life to a horrific end' when she was trying to do him a good deed after offering to give him and his daughter a ride to hospital.

In the second day of the trial in Fairfax County, Virginia, Vanessa's family members cried as Detective Derek Hardy talked about the vast amount of blood in her car.

It was also revealed yesterday that immigration officials could have deported Blanco-Garcia months before the brutal slaying after he was held at the Fairfax County jail for a few hours on a public intoxication charge in 2010.

Caught: Julio Miguel Blanco Garcia, left, is on trial for the 2010 stabbing death of Vanessa Pham, right, after an April 2012 arrest for stealing champagne provided police with matching fingerprints on the murder weapon

Detective Derek Hardy said: 'The most important thing that I found or that I noted was the amount of blood that was inside that car'

Clothes: Vanessa Pham's blood-soaked T-Shirt she was wearing on the day she was murdered was also shown to the jury - the slash marks were visible

He was released without being 
fingerprinted and before federal immigration officials were able to file
 paperwork requesting that he be detained until they could take him into
 custody because he had overstayed his visa.

Though DNA and fingerprints were 
recovered at the scene of the June 27, 2010, crime, it was two 
and-a-half years before the Gautemala native was arrested because he was
 not in the police database.

Prosecutors have asked jurors to find
 the day laborer guilty of the first-degree murder of Falls Church 
teenager, who was found dead in the driver's seat of her car.

Their first witness - the medical 
examiner who performed the autopsy on Vanessa - described the 'numerous 
sharp, force injuries' from the incise wounds and added that six stab 
wounds were found in the lung alone.

The murder weapon was shown in court -
 which had dried blood on it - as well as the blood-soaked T-shirt and 
blood-splattered car.

The medical examiner said Vanessa was alive when the wounds were inflicted and she would have felt great pain, NBC reports.

Evidence: The blade from the knife used to stab Vanessa Pham 13 times in the seat of her car in June 2010

Police also found two diaper cloths in the car: One clean in the back and one up front bloodied from Vanessa's wounds

Accused: Julio Miguel Blanco-Garcia arrives at court for the second day of his hearing yesterday, he has pleaded not guilty

Outside of the courtroom the disclosure that immigration officials previously tried to take him into custody have raised questions about whether local and 
federal policies let him slip through the cracks.

U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement was notified of Blanco-Garcia’s 2010 misdemeanor for public 
intoxication and planned to file paperwork to take custody of him.

The Falls Church teenager was found dead in the driver's seat of her car

Before they could do this, he was released by local authorities on personal recognizance before he could be fingerprinted based on the low-level nature of the charge.

Garcia was finally taken into custody when he was arrested for stealing three bottles of Moet and Chandon from a grocery store.

Bob Dane, spokesman for the Federation
 for American Immigration Reform, told the Washington Times: 'We’re 
looking into a black hole here as part of the procedure and it 
should be a wake-up call for the public to ask how Fairfax County 
handles illegal aliens and what they do when ICE doesn’t send the paddy 
wagon.'.

Blanco-Garcia denies the charge of 
Miss Pham's premeditated murder, but has admitted knifing her to death 
in a drug-fueled fury after he begged her to drive him and his daughter
 to hospital.

'This is not a
 case that is about who,' defense attorney Alberto Salvado said in his 
opening statement on Monday, according to the Washington Post.

'This is a
 case about why. It is a perfect storm of tragedy.'

For two-and-a-half years Vanessa's killing remained one of the area's most notorious unsolved murders.

Despite
 finding the murder weapon with fingerprints under the driver's seat, 
the DNA evidence didn't match anyone in the police database.

A
 break in the case came only in April 2012 when Julio Miguel Blanco 
Garcia was arrested for stealing three bottles of Moet & Chandon 
champagne from a McLean, Virginia shop.

Initially,
 his lawyers tried to get the case dismissed, claiming that the media's 
coverage of the investigation tainted their client's ability to receive a
 fair trial since nearly all of the evidence in the case was released 
before a jury was selected.

Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Marum Roush dismissed that claim last week, saying all of the evidence reported in The Washington Post would come out in trial and that jury members could set aside what they learned in the press. 

Taken: Pham was home for the summer, looking forward to a new babysitting job and a visit from her boyfriend when she was stabbed to death while giving Blanco Garcia a ride

Vanessa had just returned home for the summer after her first year studying fashion design at the Savannah College of Art and Design.

She was living with her mother at their apartment in Falls Church, and had just landed a babysitting gig for the summer the same day she was killed.

The 19-year-old was also looking forward to a visit from her boyfriend Aaron Apsley who lived in Ohio.

Around 2:45pm she decided to go to the Fairfax Plaza Shopping Center to get her eyebrows done at JD Nail Salon.

It was while leaving the salon that she first encountered Blanco Garcia, standing outside holding his one-year-old daughter. 

Garcia started his day by going into Washington, D.C. with his daughter to buy $400 dollars of PCP.

When he got home he smoked three cigarettes dipped in liquid PCP before going to the mall with his daughter.

According
 to court documents, by the time he approached Vanessa outside the mall, he
 was having a 'severe PCP intoxication' and asked the young woman to 
take him and his daughter to the hospital.

Surveillance footage subsequently shows Pham's white Scion exiting the parking lot.

Taken for a ride: Pham agreed to take Blanco Garcia and his one-year-old daughter to the hospital, but was found less than a mile away stabbed to death in her crashed car

According to an account given to police by Blanco Garcia, Vanessa accidentally took a wrong turn and he overreacted.

'Vanessa did nothing wrong,' a detective paraphrased Blanco Garcia in a report made after his arrest.

At
 this point, Blanco Garcia was hallucinating and believed the teen was 
going to harm his daughter or call the police, so he acted.

He
 took out a butcher's knife from his backpack and stabbed the girl 13 
times which caused her to lose control of the vehicle and crash into a 
ravine on the side of the road. 

Blanco Garcia ditched the knife and left Vanessa to die, fleeing from the vehicle with his daughter through the sunroof.

A
 driver spotted the car at 3:34pm, less than half a mile from the mall 
and called police. When police arrived, they found Vanessa belted into her 
seat and covered in blood with one wheel of the car still spinning.

But police were stumped when it came to finding the suspect.

Severely intoxicated: Blanco Garcia has spent his day traveling into Washington D.C. to buy $400 dollars of PCP with his daughter, and had smoked three cigarettes dipped in the drugs before going to the shopping center

Even though the knife was left in the car, the DNA evidence produced no matches in the police database.

Investigators were certain the killer was a stranger since they had no reason to believe the pretty student had any enemies or was in any trouble.

They canvassed the area around the mall and collected DNA from Vanessa's friends and family, local sex offenders and homeless people around the mall, but again, no matches.

Vanessa's story was even highlighted on TV show 'America's Most Wanted' to no avail.

It wasn't until almost two years later that Blanco Garcia was arrested for stealing two bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne at a grocery store in McLean, Virginia.

Even then, it took police until last December 10 to make the connection with his prints.

'[Blanco Garcia] was arrested in April for larceny of champagne. Imagine that!' wrote Fairfax County police detective Robert Bond in an email that day.

A few days later Blanco Garcia was arrested at his job site in Vienna, Virginia. He said he never told anyone about the killing.

A search of Blanco Garcia's computer showed that he tracked news of the investigation on his computer.
