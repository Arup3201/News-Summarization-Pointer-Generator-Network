Facing trial: Abu Hamza will go on trial next month in New York facing allegations that he controlled a global network of jihadists

Hate preacher Abu Hamza has been dubbed a ‘terrorist leader of global reach’ by the US government who claim he sent ‘lieutenants’ to terror camps worldwide.

A decade after he was first arrested in Britain on a US warrant for terrorism charges sparking an extraordinary extradition battle costing British taxpayers over £2million, the hook-handed cleric is finally due to go on trial next month in New York facing allegations that he controlled a global network of jihadists.

Prosecutors have lodged legal papers ahead of his forthcoming trial alleging that: ‘The [American] government will show that the defendant was a terrorist leader of global reach who ... sent his young lieutenants around the world to engage in terror training.’

The prosecution will say the preacher used Finsbury Park mosque in north London as a recruiting base, not only inspiring jihadists with his hateful sermons, but also allegedly directly providing support to Al Qaeda from Britain.

His trial, which is due to take place at a federal court in Manhattan on April 14, is expected to reveal his alleged links to top terrorist chiefs.

Court papers show prosecutors consider him so dangerous that they have argued jurors should be given anonymity and an armed guard for their safety.

He faces 11 terrorism charges spanning America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia which go back as far as 1998.

If convicted, he faces spending the rest of his life in a maximum security US prison.

The trial, scheduled to last six weeks, could prove embarrassing for the British security services and previous governments who allowed the preacher to operate freely for years after he arrived here from Egypt, despite openly giving sermons praising Osama bin Laden in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.

Court papers allege one of his ‘lieutenants’ from London was sent to Afghanistan for ‘violent jihad training’ and said he was prepared to take part in attacks against American and Jewish targets.

Hamza is separately accused of trying to set up a ‘jihad training camp’ in Bly, Oregon where one of his followers is said to have penned a letter to Osama bin Laden saying: ‘We love you here.’

The judge in the case is due to decide this week whether to accept key evidence against Hamza from an Al Qaeda ‘supergrass’ via CCTV from a secret location in Britain.

Saajid Badat, a former grammar school pupil from Gloucester, pulled out of a plot to blow up a transatlantic airliner with a shoe bomb in 2001.

Hamza is also charged with involvement in a hostage-taking incident in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian

He was later convicted, but freed from jail early in return for agreeing to give evidence against other terror suspects.

Badat’s testimony helped to convict Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Bin Laden’s son-in-law, at a separate trial in New York this month.

When he first travelled to Afghanistan for training in 1999, he met Saif al-Adel, the terror group’s former security chief.

American prosecutors claim that when al-Adel learnt that Badat was British, he asked him if he knew Hamza.

Badat is expected to testify that he met one of Hamza’s acolytes in Afghanistan and acted as an interpreter during a key meeting with another Al Qaeda chief when the young recruit was asked ‘whether he would be willing to engage in attacks against US and Jewish targets outside of Afghanistan’.

Court papers state: ‘The witness’s testimony about al-Adel demonstrates that the defendant was well known to senior Al Qaeda leadership, and that the defendant was trusted by Al Qaeda to send them trainees.’

Hamza’s lawyers reject Badat’s evidence and are expected to argue that it is unreliable given the deal Badat struck with the authorities to secure his own freedom.

They have also asked for any mention of the 9/11 attacks or former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to be banned from proceedings, claiming it would deny their client a fair trial.

But this has been rejected by District Judge Katherine Forrest, who has also denied the prosecution’s application to keep jurors’ names secret.

Hamza is also charged with involvement in a hostage-taking incident in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian.

The preacher was first arrested here in May 2004 on a US extradition warrant and charged with 15 terrorism offences.

In 2006 he was jailed for soliciting murder and stirring up racial hatred.

He was extradited to America in 2012 after a costly and protracted legal battle invoking human rights law.

He denies all the charges.
