Cardiff City goalkeeper David Marshall will have X-rays on his hand on Monday after dislocating a finger during Sunday’s friendly with Yeovil Town.

The Scotland international is a target for a number of clubs but could now miss the Championship kick-off.

Cardiff, meanwhile, have told Inter Milan they want £12m for Chile midfielder Gary Medel.

Injured: David Marshall could miss the start of the Championship season

Price tag: And they've also told Inter they want £12m for midfielder Gary Medel

Medel most recently appeared for Chile at the World Cup, where he impressed in a defensive role.

He played 34 league games for the Bluebirds last season in what could prove to be his first and last campaign at the Cardiff City Stadium.

The holding midfielder was unable to stop Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side from slipping back into the Championship as the Welsh outfit finished rock bottom in the Premier League.
