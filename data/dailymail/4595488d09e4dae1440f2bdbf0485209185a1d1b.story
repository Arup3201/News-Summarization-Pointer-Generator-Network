A wine bar is to open up within a French hospital with the aim of cheering up terminally ill patients.

The Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital in central France will open the bar in September where it is hoped it will improve the quality of life of patients.

Housed in the hospital's palliative care centre, patients will also be able to invite in their friends and family to share a glass of wine with them.

The bar, which will be the first of its kind in France, will 'cheer up the difficult day-to-day existence of patients, according to head of the centre Virgine Guastella.

She said: 'The aim is to re-humanise patients by improving the quality of their day-to-day existence and also by giving them the pleasure of being able to offer and receive.

The bar in the hospital will serve wine, as well as beer, whiskey and champagne

The bar would also allow families facing bereavement to create moments of conviviality despite being in a hospital environment, she added.

'It's a little detail but it can make all the difference.'

Staff at the hospital will receive special training from a social anthropologist on how to handle patients who come into the bar.

In addition to wine, it will also stock beer, whiskey and champagne.

If the bar in the hospital proves to be a success, it is thought bar could be open in other French hospitals.

The news comes as last month it was announced that the French government were to allow bosses the right to ban alcohol from the workplace because it 'threatens the security and the physical and mental well-being of workers.’

France’s employment ministry is responsible for the directive, and a spokesman said ‘alcohol is the biggest psycho-active substance consumed in France’.
