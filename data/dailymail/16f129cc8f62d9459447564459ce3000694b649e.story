David Beckham has suffered the humiliation of being rejected for a knighthood after a row among the officials in charge of honours.

Some said he should be made Sir David for his footballing achievements and for helping London to host the 2012 Olympics.

But other officials, described by a source as ‘one or two stuffed-shirt snobs’, said it was too soon to make cockney-accented Beckham, 38, a knight of the realm.

It was argued that after a knighthood for Tour de France-winning cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins last year, sporting gongs were ‘in danger of being handed out like confetti’.

But glamorous Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins, 33, is set to receive an OBE – four years after she admitted taking cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis as a student. She is also known for her charity work and has performed concerts in Iraq and Afghanistan for British troops.

A vigorous debate took place over whether Beckham should get the nod in this week’s New Year Honours – or be made to wait. In the end, his critics won. ‘There was a view it wouldn’t do him any harm to wait a bit longer,’ said one source. If Beckham is to receive the honour in the future, the entire vetting process will have to start from scratch.

The rejection is a bitter blow to 
Beckham’s wife, former Spice Girl  Victoria, who would have received the
 honorary title of ‘Lady Beckham’ – although she would no doubt have 
become known as ‘Lady Posh’.

The snub is all the more embarrassing after reports that Beckham’s knighthood was assured. A national newspaper last month suggested the decision had been made. And it claimed football-loving Prince William would knight ‘Sir David’ at Buckingham Palace.

Beckham’s name was put forward for a knighthood in May when he announced he was ending his glittering 20-year career as a footballer. He earned 115 England caps and won the Premiership with Manchester United six times. Tony Blair has praised his role in the team of politicians and sports stars that helped London win the right to stage last year’s Olympics. He is also a ‘goodwill ambassador’ for global children’s charity Unicef and a patron of Sir Elton John’s Aids Foundation.

In 2003, when the Queen awarded him the 
OBE for services to football, Beckham – now a global fashion  pin-up, 
modelling his own range of underwear – said: ‘I am honoured and 
privileged to receive this recognition. It’s not just for me but for 
Manchester United, England, all of my team-mates and my family.’ 

Getting the equivalent of a knighthood ‘red card’ from the Honours 
Committee will hurt every bit as much as his two England red cards. As recently as last week, asked about reports he was getting a knighthood, Beckham said: ‘I’ve heard a few of these rumours as well but I’m not paying them too much attention.

‘I’m so busy with my kids – I’m just a dad. We’ll see what happens with the knighthood but I’m proud of what I’ve already achieved.’

Waiting game: Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, awarded the OBE last year, was also passed over on the grounds that he should wait for a higher honour

Discussing the prospect of David being knighted, Victoria once said: ‘I’d love that, that would be quite fabulous. It’s just so camp, it’s wonderful isn’t it? Lady Victoria – that would be quite amazing.’

Bookmakers Coral were so certain that Beckham was about to be knighted, they suspended betting on it two weeks ago.

Beckham is not the only sports star to miss out.

Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, awarded the OBE last year, was also passed over on the grounds that he should wait for a higher honour.

Traditionally shrouded in secrecy, the honours system is overseen by the Cabinet Office honours and appointments secretariat.
