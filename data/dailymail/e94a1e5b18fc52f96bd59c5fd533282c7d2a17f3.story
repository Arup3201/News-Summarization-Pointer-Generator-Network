The heartbroken family of a pregnant mother mysteriously shot to death as she drove home six weeks ago are still desperately searching for answers.

Brittany Stykes, 22, was shot in the neck and through the chest as she drove in Bethel, Ohio with her 14-month-old daughter Aubree inside the car and crashed the vehicle into a wooded area.

When a passerby spotted her yellow Jeep, he discovered her and her unborn child dead inside and her toddler daughter crying for her mother, covered in blood. Aubree had been shot once in the head but is recovering after multiple surgeries.

Six weeks on and police are still 
trying to figure out where the shots came from and why anyone would want
to hurt the caring church-goer and happily married mother.

Tragic: Brittany Stykes, 22, was shot and killed, while her daughter Aubree, left, was shot in the head as they drove home on August 28. Police still do not know who shot the bullets or where they came from

'We were looking forward to 
everything,' her devastated husband Shane told the Cincinnati Enquirer. 'She was my everything, my world.'

The married stay-at-home mother was four months pregnant and her unborn child also died in the tragedy on August 28. Five bullets hit the car through the driver's side, authorities said.

Autopsy results show that no gunpowder 
residue was found on Stykes' body, which suggests that the shots weren't
fired at close range.

'We do not have enough to say right now that this was random. Was she targeted? We don't know,' Detective Sgt. Moore said.

On the mend: Aubree, pictured with her father Shane, has undergone three surgeries and needs another

Injuries: The little girl was found covered in blood and crying for her mother by a passerby after the shooting

He
said they were uncertain whether bullets came from across the highway 
or from a passing car - and after interviews with as many as 50 people, 
they still have no answers.

She did not have life insurance, family members said, and police said Shane, Brittany's ex-boyfriend and a third person all passed a polygraph test.

Police added that Shane's alibi - that he was working out a small gym with at least three police officers present - was solid.

Police added that there were no domestic 
calls to the Stykes' home and Brittany's parents said she had been 
happily married to Shane since 2012, and loved his children, aged six 
and 14, like her own.

Shane said he had no idea who would want to hurt his wife.

Probe: Authorities closed the road in the days after to search for evidence that could lead to an arrest

Torn apart: Family members say Brittany, right, lived for her daughter Aubree, left, her family and husband

'My wife and I never ran the bars, nothing like that,' he said. 'We're church-going, good people. We're not tied in with shady people of
any sort.'

He added that he learned of her death when Brown County deputies banged on his door while he was asleep later that night. They then took him to the sheriff's 
office, swabbed his hands for gunshot residue and questioned him, he said.

He then called her parents, Mary and David Dodson, to break the news.

While her daughter was killed, her granddaughter survived. A bullet pierced Aubree's frontal lobe and exited her head and has undergone three surgeries to alleviate pressure in her head.

'I
need to know,' Mary Dodson said about the shooter. 'Whoever did it was evil and they took something that was not theirs to 
take.'
