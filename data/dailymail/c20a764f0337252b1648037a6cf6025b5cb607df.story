The FTSE 100 soared to a record high today as Britain's economic growth was given a 'pat on the back' by a leading international think-tank.

The index of leading companies trading on the London Stock Exchange closed at 6,949.6, beating its previous life-time high set on December 30, 1999 at the height of the dot-com boom.

It is a major boost for Chancellor George Osborne who was today lauded by the OECD for his 'remarkable' stewardship of the economy.

The FTSE 100 Index has risen to a record high, its previous life-time high set on December 30, 1999

Today's rally on the stock market means the FTSE 100 is now 13 percent higher since hitting a low in December and has risen by almost 6 per cent in 2015. 

Stocks rose in part after the European Central Bank agreed a 1.1 trillion euro (£820 billion) stimulus scheme to buy bonds, or parcels of government and corporate debt.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney also revealed today that record low inflation means interest rates could be cut even further to near zero, in a boost for homeowners. 

OECD chief Angel Gurria, on a visit to London, even echoed a Tory slogan by hailing the Government's 'long term economic plan'.

But he also warned that UK plc's recovery would be in jeopardy unless productivity improved - and highlighted the continuing threat from high property prices.

Launching the OECD's latest survey of the British economy, Mr Gurria noted that 2.6 per cent growth last year was the highest in the G7. The organisation expects the rate to be the same this year.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said interest could be cut below 0.5 per cent - but it was still more likely that they would rise

Interest rates could be cut even further from their already record low of just 0.5 per cent, the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney revealed this morning.

The Bank chief said the banking system could cope with interest rates being cut closer to zero – but refused to say how far they could fall.

However, Mr Carney insisted it was still more likely that rates would go up after inflation returns to normal after a period of falling prices this year.

Mr Carney said that three-quarters of the current weakness in inflation was due to falling prices of oil and food, which he said was a 'temporary, one-off development'.

He stressed that if there was any evidence of a sustained fall in inflation, the Bank could 'if necessary' cut interest rates from their current 0.5 per cent low to zero, but he emphasised that the 'focus of policy is towards tightening'.

He said: 'Because of the resilience of banking and building societies has increased, we are in a position where we could, if necessary, cut bank rates towards zero. That is – to a level that is still above zero – but we haven't specified a specific level.'

Mr Gurria said the performance of the labour market had been 'remarkable', with three million jobs created over the past five years. 

Relative to the size of the UK population, the figures were even better than those recorded in the US over the period, he said.

'Even as unemployment has fallen, inflationary pressures have vanished ... real wages are on the rise,' Mr Gurria told a press conference in the Treasury.

'We are predicting this economic expansion will continue this year and next. What a difference effective economic policies can make.'

The fall in the oil price combined with fears over Greece had pulled markets lower at the start of 2015 but ECB stimulus and tentative hopes of a new deal on Greece's debts have, together with a slight bounce-back for oil, helped them recover.

It comes after the FTSE 100 ended 2014 lower than it started in the first annual fall since 2011, leaving investors hoping for a better performance this year.

Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, said that UK shares had underperformed relative to Wall Street in the last couple of years, leaving them relatively cheap.

Equities had been held back by falling commodity prices and anxiety over the Scottish referendum, meaning the market now offers better valuations for those hunting dividends, he said.

Added to the likelihood of interest rates remaining low until the end of the year, it produced a 'positive combination' for investors. 

Mr Osborne seized on the praise from the OECD, including the Tories' election slogan about having a 'long term economic plan'.

The Chancellor wrote on Twitter: 'The OECD report shows we have right strategy & Sec Gen Gurria says 'Britain has a long term economic plan & we need to stick to it' - I agree.'

Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'This report confirms that the UK economy is returning to health and highlights the vital role of key Liberal Democrat policies in the turnaround.

'Our dramatic increases in the personal allowance, the greening of the economy, the focus on infrastructure, and putting the financial sector back on an even keel are just a few examples of where Liberal Democrat thinking has been central to the economic turnaround.

'Our commitment to continue the same balanced approach in the next parliament is in stark contrast to the Conservatives, who are abandoning fairness and the centre ground.

'By urging years of cuts for cuts' sake, by unfairly finishing the job of balancing the books on the backs of the least well-off and undermining our position in Europe, they will put this hard-won recovery at risk.' 

Shadow chief secretary to the treasury Chris Leslie said: 'The OECD is right to highlight the challenge of increasing productivity in order to sustainably raise living standards and so get the deficit down.

'This is what Labour's better plan for Britain's prosperity, which we published this month, is all about. Our plan includes cutting business rates for small firms, reforming the banking sector, investing in training and apprenticeships and keeping Britain in a reformed EU.

'Government standing back and hoping wealth will trickle-down from the top to everyone else simply won't work. We need a recovery that reaches kitchen tables across Britain, not one which has left working people £1,600 a year worse off since 2010.'
