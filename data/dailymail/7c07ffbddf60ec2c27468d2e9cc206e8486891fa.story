The programme will provide about 5,000 days of volunteering support.

Inspire future athletes: Olympic athletes wishing to compete in the 2016 Olympic Games will have to do five days of volunteering if they get National Lottery funding

She will say: ‘In schools and clubs across the UK our Olympic athletes will be dedicated to helping the next generation shine as they themselves have shone this summer.

Driving up sport participation: Culture Secretary Maria Miller will unveil the programme at the Conservative Party Conference today

The Department for Culture, Media and 
Sport last night confirmed the new programme, which they said is aimed 
at ‘driving up sports participation in schools’.

A spokesman for the department said: ‘It
is about mentoring and coaching young people and using the success and 
popularity of the Games, and big names of the athletes, to drive up 
sports participation and inspire future stars.

‘We want to inspire the next generation of athletes,’ he added.

The volunteering drive is expected to be aimed at children at sixth form age who are most likely drop out of sports activities and lose interest in it.

The Prime Minister announced in August that UK Sport will receive £500m over the next four years to maintain funding for Olympic sports at same level before the 2016 Games as during the runup to London.

Mr Cameron said: ‘There’s a direct link between elite success and participation in sport. I want one of the legacies of these Games to be our athletes triumphing in Rio in 2016, and in future Olympic Games. Guaranteeing this funding will help ensure that happens.’

In her speech, Mrs Miller is also expected to thank the 70,000 Olympic volunteers from this year, who are said to have contributed eight million hours of unpaid work behind the scenes.

London 2012 Chairman Lord Coe said the volunteers had cultivated one of the country’s biggest fan clubs, and his reference to them at the Paralympic closing ceremony drew one of the most sustained ovations of the night.

Mrs Miller took over from Jeremy Hunt as the Culture Secretary in the cabinet reshuffle last month.
