More than 1,000 Swedish shoppers have signed up to make payments with a simple swipe of their hand, using new technology that 'reads' the patterns of their veins.

The developers hope hand scanning will become an alternative payment method if it is a success during trials in the city of Lund in southern Sweden.

The vein-scanning terminals have been installed in 15 shops and restaurants after an engineering student at the local university came up with the technology two years ago while waiting in line to pay.

Some 1,600 people have signed up already for the system which its inventor insists is safer than credit cards.

The social network is rumoured to be seeking regulatory approval to offer financial services - including electronic money and remittances - which would allow foreign workers to easily transfer money back to their families.

If the social network does become an e-money institution, people in Europe could use the social network as a bank account of kind - to store virtual money.

The services could offer remittances, which would let foreign workers securely transfer money to their home country.

If Facebook offers the service to developing markets in the future, it could hook in millions of new users and make plenty of extra money in advertising.

The service could prove attractive in areas where accessing and saving money securely is not as simple as nipping to a local bank.

'Every individual's vein pattern is completely unique, so there really is no way of committing fraud with this system,' said researcher Fredrik Leifland. 'You always need your hand scanned for a payment to go through.'

While vein scanning technology existed previously, it has not been used as a form of payment before.

'We had to connect all the players ourselves, which was quite complex - the vein scanning terminals, the banks, the stores and the customers,' Mr Leifland added.

The plan is to patent the system and expand it around the globe.

To sign up, users have to visit a shop or restaurant with a terminal, where they scan their palm three times and enter their social security and telephone numbers.

A text message is then sent to their mobile phone with an activation link to a website, with payments taken directly from customer's bank accounts twice a month.
