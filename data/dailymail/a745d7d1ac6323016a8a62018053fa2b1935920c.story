Convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby has been visiting the Bali home of Ben Panangian, who has been arrested for possession of marijuana, two to three times a week since she was released from jail, neighbours have claimed.

Corby who was released on February 10 this year from Kerobokan prison in Bali is on strict parole conditions after spending nine years in jail.

It was claimed this week that Corby and Panangian were not in a relationship after the two were pictured together in May and allegedly met in jail.

Ben Panangian lives on the second floor of a South Kuta apartment on the Indonesian island of Bali

Behind the doors of Panangian's South Kuta apartment - south of Bali's capital Denpasar - a pile of men's and women's clothing were found

But the landlord at Ben’s rented apartment in South Kuta and a neighbour has told Daily Mail Australia that Corby visits Ben in the morning and afternoons at his house about two to three times a week.

‘She comes in the afternoon and leaves by the evening,’ landlord Myoman Yasa said.

Arrested: Indonesian police allege Ben Panangian was in possession of marijuana

The neighbour, named Fitri, saw Ben being arrested on Wednesday night after two police cars pulled up in the courtyard.

He appeared relaxed as they led him out of the room on the first floor of the apartment block.

The police were holding a black bag, thought to be the bag of marijuana they found in his cupboard.

The landlord gave Daily Mail Australia access to his apartment.

Inside there was a double mattress on the floor, a red bean bag which had been torn open, an empty fridge and a cupboard that was full of neatly folded men and women’s clothes.

A black and pink lacy g-string was just one item of woman’s clothing found in the wooden cupboard.

The room also featured a small sink and stove, a water fountain and a small shower room where a bright pink sponge hung on the wall.

Indonesian art adorned his bedroom wall, including two masks and a blue painting.

Daily Mail Australia showed the neighbour and landlord recent photos of Schapelle and they confirmed that she was ‘definitely’ the woman they had seen visiting the house.

The landlord said Ben had lived in the apartment block for three years and paid 700,000 Indonesian rupiah a month (64 Australian dollars) for the room.

A surfboard bag and a double bed was found on a floor, along with a red bean bag

Neightbour Fitri identified Corby from a photo and saw Panangian being arrested by police on Wednesday

He previously lived on a ground floor apartment in the modest complex but his friend now rents that room, they said.

The two men often go surfing together and work in the same office but when Ben comes home he does not speak to his neighbours more than to say hello, the landlady said.

‘Ben is an introvert he doesn’t talk with neighbours he just comes and says hi and goes to his room,’ the neighbour added.

She said a different ‘foreign’ woman used to visit the apartment but Schapelle began coming at the beginning of this year - once she was released from jail.

In custody: Schapelle Corby's boyfriend Ben Panangian is pictured in orange prison scrubs marked with the number 99 and a balaclava at a police press conference

Schapelle Corby's boyfriend has been charged by Indonesian police after he was allegedly caught in possession of drugs in Bali

Schapelle Corby was released from a Bali jail in February after serving nine years for drug smuggling

Police have reportedly finished interrogating Ben now and he is being held at a police holding cell in Polresta in Denpasar.

They seized his Honda Vario scooter when they arrested him, the neighbour said.

Since his arrest, a friend has visited his room to pick up a surfboard and another friend came to pick up some clothes to take them to him in the police station, the neighbour added.

The Indonesian boyfriend of convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby has been pictured in police custody after he was arrested for alleged possession of marijuana.

Ben Panangian is shown alongside other drug suspects in photos taken at a police press conference wearing orange prison scrubs with a bizarre balaclava covering his face on Saturday.

As police did not reveal the identities of the prisoners, Panangian could only be identified by his prison number 99 which is printed on his overalls.
