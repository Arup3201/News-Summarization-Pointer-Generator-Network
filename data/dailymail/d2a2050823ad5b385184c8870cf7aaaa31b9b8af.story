Four students in African robes and brandishing fake Kalashnikovs caused widespread panic and hysteria by staging a ‘terror attack’ in a French hospital.

The men stormed into the building last night in Saint-Roch hospital in the Riviera city of Nice.

Fearing a repeat of the 2012 Al-Qaeda-inspired attack in south France, which left six dead, the building was put on lockdown as patients were evacuated to a different part of the hospital and incoming ambulances were diverted.

Between 50 to 70 police officers were deployed to hunt down the apparent terrorists, who one witness told local newspaper Nice Matin were carrying what looked like M16 or Kalashnikov assault rifles.

Police spent 45 minutes hunting down the men before they were arrested in the corridor, reported French website The Local. 

That is when they discovered the 'terrorists' were four dental students taking part in a prank.

Hospital director Martine Rajzman told AFP: 'The four lads had a dismayed look about them, having suddenly realized the consequences of their actions.'

But the consequences of their actions had already proved terrifying for staff and patients.

The neighbourhood surrounding the Saint-Roch hospital in the centre of Nice was placed on lockdown by authorities.

The students were taken to a local police station after their fake firearms were confiscated.

France is on high alert for attacks - earlier this month, two French journalists, Claude Verlon and Ghislaine Dupont of Radio France Internationale, were found dead on the outskirts of the northern town of Kidal after being kidnapped - Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb later claimed responsibility.

It followed France launching air strikes and sending hundreds of soldiers into Niger's neighbour Mali in January to drive back Al Qaeda rebels, saying they would use the West African country as a base for attacks on the west.

The prank brought unwelcome 
reminders of the March 2012 killing spree by Al-Qaeda-inspired gunman 
Mohamed Merah, who shot dead seven people in southwestern France, 
including three Jewish children.
