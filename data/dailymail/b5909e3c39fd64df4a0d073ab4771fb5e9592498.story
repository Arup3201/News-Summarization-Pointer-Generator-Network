Tools of the trade: Home baking star Mary berry is launching her own range of kitchen equipment for Lakeland

The success of the Great British Bake Off has seen sales of kitchen accessories soar.

Now one of its stars is taking a slice of the action with her own range of baking equipment for Lakeland.

Mary Berry, who taught the nation to make everything from simple cupcakes to show-stopping chocolate gateaux, has published countless recipes. But her fans will now be able to make them using tools that meet her exacting standards.

Celebrity chefs such as Heston 
Blumenthal and Jamie Oliver have already cashed in on their fame and 
expertise by lending their names to pans, sauces and high-end toasters.

Miss
 Berry’s devotees will be able to float about the kitchen in aprons 
carrying her stamp of approval, while wielding her palette knives, flour
 sifters and cake lifters. There is also a range of ‘pushpans’ – cake 
tins with loose bases that allow bakers to turn out the perfect creation
 without worrying that it might get stuck – and a ‘traybake’ for cooking
 brownies and other sweet treats.

These are non-stick and provide cutting guides so users can turn out cakes that are uniform.

Miss
 Berry has a long association with Lakeland that dates back to the late 
1960s. She was involved in the early designs of some of the firm’s 
customer favourites.

The Bake Off judge hopes her range will inspire yet more home cooks to take up a whisk.

‘I firmly believe that, equipped with the right tools and a simple recipe, anyone can achieve great results in the kitchen,’ she said.

Miss Berry added: ‘It’s important to me that the products in the range really “work” … I have worked to ensure each piece is both easy to use and practical.’ 

Kitchen kit: Mary Berry's pushpans, from £10.99, make removing cakes easier

Non-stick: The traybake, also £10.99, can be used to cook brownies and other sweet treats in the kitchen

Lakeland’s Veronica Davidson visited the ‘Queen of Cakes’ at her home and went through her cupboards as part of the design process – and the partnership promises to be lucrative for both parties.

The Great British Bake Off has had a remarkable impact on sales of equipment and ingredients.

When the BBC series returned this year, John Lewis reported sales of hand mixers were up 23 per cent, measuring spoons by 29 per cent and paper cake cases by 44 per cent.
