Britain will go Christmas shopping crazy today when hundreds of thousands of gifts are slashed in price by as much as 70 per cent.

Black Friday — the biggest day in America’s festive shopping calendar — has arrived in the UK to kick off the pre-Christmas rush.

With huge discounts on everything from flatscreen TVs to party shoes, it’s expected to get shoppers in the mood to spend.

Black Friday has crept across the Atlantic over the past few years as U.S. giants such as Amazon and Apple have sought to include the UK in the shopping frenzy. 

Indeed, Apple is having a Black Friday Extravaganza, where top-secret shopping savings will be unveiled, and Amazon is offering fixed-time ‘lightning deals’ throughout the event.

But this year, British stores such as John Lewis and Debenhams have joined in, slashing their prices for one day only.

Of course, cynics would say Black Friday is simply a marketing ploy to make us part with even more cash.

But if you’re sensible and stick to your shopping list, there’s no better time to snap up some bargain Christmas presents.

Here, ELIZA SCARBOROUGH picks the best of Britain’s Black Friday deals . . .
