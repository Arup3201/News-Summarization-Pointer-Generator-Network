Chelsea Under 18s blazed their way into the quarter-final of the FA Youth Cup with 6-0 demolition of Swansea Under 18s at Aldershot's Recreation Ground on Wednesday.

The youth cup holders started strongly and Tammy Abraham netted the first of the night after only 14 minutes after a neat interchange from Kyle Scott and Jay Dasilva.

The lead was doubled before half-time, when Abraham received a pass from Scott and fired in powerfully off the underside of the crossbar.

Chelsea upped the gears further in the second half and made their superiority pay.

Dominic Solanke got the third only 30 seconds into the second half with a delicate chip before Abraham converted Dasilva's cross to make it four and complete a ruthless hat-trick.

Substitute Kasey Palmer then weaved past two challenges before tucking the ball past Swansea goalkeeper Lewis Thomas, before Solanke got his second goal of the night with a low shot.

Chelsea will face either Sunderland or Newcastle in the quarter-final.
