A Yorkshire inn has won the 'best pub pie' title with an offering described as 'perfect' by judges.

The Chestnut Horse, between Driffield and Bridlington in the East Riding of Yorkshire, won the title for a pie that, despite being named the Welsh Cob, is made of diced lamb surrounded by pastry infused with dried mint.

The pub, which has a menu of 35 pies, all named after breeds of horses, was named the winner from more than 200 entries in the Olive magazine competition that were cut to a shortlist of five.

Lead judge Tom Kerridge, the chef and owner of two Michelin-starred pub the Hand and Flowers in Buckinghamshire, praising the 'balance between the lamb, the filling and the gravy' and naming it 'the perfect pie'.

The runner up was The Hare Arms in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, for a steak and peppercorn pie with a brandy and cream sauce described by Kerridge as 'lush, peppery and spicy'.

Also on the shortlist was a chicken, bacon and cider pie from Dolaucothi Arms in Pumsaint, Carmarthenshire, a chicken balti pie from The Blue Flame Inn in Nailsea, Bristol, and a Welsh lamb, cockle and leek pie from Y Ffarmers in Llanfihangel y Creuddyn near Aberystwyth.

Olive editor Christine Hayes said: 'We love a good pub pie at Olive and now we know the nation really does as well.

'We were overwhelmed by the response we got from across the country, so judging was a tricky and tasty conundrum.

'However, the judges were unanimous in awarding the Chestnut Horse the honour of being Olive and Marks & Spencer’s Pub Pie of the Year.'
