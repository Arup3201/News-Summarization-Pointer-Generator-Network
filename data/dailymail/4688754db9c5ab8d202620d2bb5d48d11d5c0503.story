Despite taking place Wembley, the home of English football, just three English players started the 2014 Community Shield between Arsenal and Manchester City.

And all three came from the Gunners, with Kieran Gibbs and Calum Chambers started in defence, whilst Jack Wilshere was deployed in midfield - and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain began the game on the bench

Premier League champions Manchester City, however, did not have a single Three Lion in their starting lineup, although four did make the bench in Joe Hart, Micah Richards, James Milner and Scott Sinclair.

Drought: Jack Wilshere was one of only three Englishmen starting the 2014 Community Shield

Last year, 10 Englishmen - five on each side - began the game as Manchester United beat Wigan 2-0, whilst the year before there were only four as Manchester City beat Chelsea 3-2.

In fact, Arsenal were also involved the only other time there were just three English players starting the Community Shield in 2005, when Frank Lampard and John Terry began the game for Chelsea in a 2-1 win over Ashley Cole and the Gunners.

With both sides set to be in the title reckoning this campaign, it is a huge concern for the top brass at the FA who are trying to improve the possibility of young English talent playing at the top level.

Gary Neville, who is assistant coach under Roy Hodgson for England, recently spoke of his concerns.

'We are slowly killing ourselves,' he told The Sun. 'We laugh at Scotland and the Republic of Ireland but it's happening to England before our eyes.

'25 years ago Liverpool had Republic of Ireland players and Scottish players, Manchester United had Scottish players, Irish players and Welsh players.

'All the top six teams did and now there are none. There are a few English players but they're dwindling fast.'
