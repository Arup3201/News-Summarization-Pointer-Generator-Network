Southern Charm star Jenna King is in for a reality check.

Recently split with wealthy 55-year-old real estate mogul, Lou, Jenna’s now proclaiming her undying love for 30-year-old bad boy Ronald ‘Ronnie’ Radke.

'You are my end game! I love you, I love you, I really f***ing love you,’ gushed Jenna, who is following Radke to Belgium to see him perform at Groezrock Music Festival on May 3.

Danger: '[I am] in fear for any other woman involved with him,' Sally Watts tells MailOnline of Jenna's new boyfriend - Sally's ex - in an exclusive interview

Nightmare:  'May 1, 2012. This was taken in fear, but is now shared to offer hope,' Sally Watts writes in the caption of her photo showing a nasty black eye that resulted in Radke's arrest. 'You are never alone. There's always a way out'

But ‘bad boy’ may be an understatement.‘It is now nearly two years since I went to the police to report the domestic abuse I suffered by Radke I am terrified by what I know he is capable of doing to another woman,’ Sally Watts exclusively tells MailOnline of her ex. 

While Lou was a respected businessman who could whisk 29-year-old Jenna around the world on private jets and keep her clothed in Chanel and Gucci, Radke the lead vocalist of rock band Falling in Reverse, offers up a dark past, including a history of domestic violence, drug addiction and a stint in jail for his involvement in a brutal 2006 murder.

The singer was arrested at his home in Glendale, Calif., for reportedly physically attacking his then girlfriend, Sally, 30. In a shocking photo Sally posted to Twitter on the night of the alleged assault, she has a nasty black eye.

Sally wrote: ‘May 1, 2012. This was taken in fear, but is now shared to offer hope. You are never alone. There’s always a way out.’

A step down: 'Just sittin on a stoop with my mannnnnnn' writes Jenna. She split with wealthy Lou and took up with Ronnie, but does she care about dark past?

Glendale police sergeant Tom Lorenz revealed that on the night in question Sally had accused Radke of cheating on her. Among other allegations, Sally told authorities that she had ‘her hair pulled by Mr. Radke and had her head and face forced down into the floor,’ reports Lorenz.

So far, Radke has managed to avoid facing the judge in the disturbing case.

‘The case is still pending in the LA criminal court, as he continues to postpone each pretrial,’Sally tells MailOnline

She alleges that the singer has used this time to continue his campaign of making her life a living hell.

‘While he has been permitted to keep touring and recording, (in one song he even makes defamatory claims about me and outlines the event very untruthfully), the postponements have never allowed me any peace or sense of justice,’ she says.

‘They keep me emotionally bound, and the trauma still haunts me and impacts my life, every single day.’

Worse, Radke’s followers have been just as relentlessly unforgiving. ‘I have been invalidated, harassed and threatened by his fans after he has provoked them with his lies about me, and in fear for any other woman involved with him,’ Sally reveals.

After the vicious fight with Sally, Radke moved on with a new girlfriend and eventual fiancée, Crissy Henderson.

Sadly, it seems she also may have had a volatile relationship with Radke, and Sally reached out to the L.A.-based model and actress via Twitter this past December.

‘A big help in my recovery was [Sally Watts] and I didn’t deserve her grace,’ Crissy wrote. ‘I was led to believe she was a monster & liar…’

Crissy also hinted: ‘I speak in truth and I’ll never be silent to protect someone who commits a crime,’ she insisted. ‘Esp when it involves putting your hands on a female.’

In a twist that puts Southern Charm resident bad boy Thomas Ravenel to shame, Radke reportedly cheated on Crissy while she was carrying their child, a girl they named Willow, born in June 2013. 

Not long after, he officially moved on with Southern Charm reality star Jenna, who seems completely blinded by her love for Radke — she’s gone as far as getting his zodiac sign, the Sagittarius archer, tattooed on her hand for him.

‘I can’t comment on [Radke and Jenna’s] relationship other than hope they’re happy,’ is all Crissy would say about her ex on tumblr. ‘I love my child and that’s my focus. Being a good mom.

Arrested development: This time, Radke was arrested not for beating his girlfriend, but a fan. He supposedly threw four mic stands into the crowd at the band¿s show at Six Flags in New Jersey and split open a girl¿s head and broke her hand

Unfortunately, cheating is the least of Radke’s sketchy history.

In May 2006, while Jenna was attending Trident Technical College in Charleston, South Carolina, Radke was across the country in Las Vegas and became involved in a spat that would result in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Cook.

The trouble started when the singer’s longtime friend and former Escape the Fate band mate, Max Green, had a silly MySpace miscommunication with a fan, who felt he had slighted her.

‘I always stick up for Max, he’s a smaller guy, and I’d always be his bigger brother, you know, people would have to come through me first to get to him,’ explained Radke.

‘But [brothers Michael and Marcel Colquitt, who had been threatening to beat up Greene for offending their female friend] started calling me and harassing me, saying they were going to come to my house and murder me. Then they started calling me “pussy” and this and that if I don’t show up to fight them.’

Baby mama: Actress Crissy Henderson, who was engaged to Radke and had his baby, thought Sally was just a scorned woman. But she says Sally was a big help in her recovery from her dysfunctional relationship with the rocker. 'I didn't deserve her grace,' Crissy says.

Both sides got their gangs of friends together and met up to settle their differences. ‘…From there you see where it went — it turned into something bigger than it was,’ said Green not long after the deadly incident. ‘The next thing we hear, people are dead.’

Radke’s friend Chase Rader reportedly ended up shooting and killing Cook during the fight Radke helped organize in a desert lot located in northwestern Las Vegas. 

In January, 2008, the singer pleaded guilty to a single charge of battery with substantial bodily harm and a judge sentenced him to pay over $92,000 in restitution to Cook’s mother, Ceda Freeman, and serve five years’ probation as well as a stint in drug and alcohol rehab.

‘I don’t think probation is good enough for him,’ said Freeman at the time. ‘He has absolutely destroyed my family.’

It didn’t take long for Radke to have another run-in with the law. Three months after his sentencing, Radke failed to check in with a probation officer and officially became a fugitive for nearly eight weeks. 

According to U.S. Marshals, Radke used his influence as a rocker in a sinister way. Officials say he stayed on the lam for so long by getting money and other aid from his devoted friends and fans.

He was sent to High Desert State Prison after the Nevada Parole and Probation Department put him on the news and the public helped hunt him down.

‘That guy is not one to think before he acts,’ said band mate Green, adding that Radke had ‘done a lot of bad things to a lot of people.’

The musician noted that the majority of the money Radke got at the time ‘went to drugs,’ adding that ‘jail is the best place for him...’

During an October 2008 interview from the Nevada prison where he spent over two years serving time, Radke admitted he was to blame for all the problems he had encountered over the previous years.

‘I deserve to be in here for the things I’ve done to other people,’ he confessed. ‘That’s my karma man.’

The question now is whether Radke’s bad karma will affect Jenna’s fate, too.
