A couple who pleaded guilty to using Craigslist to find a
dog for the wife to have sex with has been sentenced to probation in a twisted
case of beastiality.

Shane Walker, 38, and his wife Sarah Dae Walker, 33, of San
Tan Valley, Arizona appeared in court on Thursday to face charges of conspiracy
to commit beastiality after soliciting an undercover deputy for the use of his
golden shepherd in June.

The couple, who had an admitted open marriage, were arrested
alongside the wife's lover Robert Aucker, 26, after the trio made plans to meet
with the dog and its owner at a Mesa Quality Inn.

Sentenced: Sarah Dae Walker, 33, and her husband Shane Walker, 38, were sentenced to supervised probation and ordered to stay away from animals after soliciting a dog for sex in June

Sarah Walker was sentenced to 24 months of supervised
probation with her husband ordered 18 months under the same beastiality
charge.

Both are also prohibited from owning or caring for any
animals.

Mr Walker, who was a flight attendant at the time of his
arrest, expressed his grief over the incident that he says caused him to lose
his job and has laid a sheet of embarrassment on his family.

'If I could turn back time, I wish I could, I can't so I'm
trying to move forward in my life,' he told the judge according to KPHO.

Apology: Mrs Walker, seen in court on Thursday, apologized for her behaviour and said the embarrassment alone has rocked not only her but her children as well

His wife offered her own apology saying the embarrassment
alone has rocked her.

'I think about my children every day. That is why I'm here.
That is why I'm alive,' she said.

Mr Walker told the judge that his wife checked into a
behavioural institute right after their arrest.

The Walkers posted a Craigslist ad on
February 7 titled, 'Wife looking for K9', according to Maricopa County 
Superior Court records.

During a number of email exchanges 
between the couple and the detective, Dae offered sexual favors and they
agreed to meet at the Quality Inn in Mesa, which is where they were 
arrested.

Hopeful: Mr Walker told the judge his wife checked into a behavioural institute following their arrest and he hopes to get back to work as a flight attendant

Court records state that Dae, a 
photographer, admitted to detectives she told both her husband and 
Aucker she wanted a dog to have sex with her.

The trio had been hoping to meet the owner of a Golden Shepherd having spent three weeks corresponding with her over the use of the dog.

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said: 'People who do this for enjoyment are a different breed, that's for certain.'

Arpaio, who is known as the toughest sheriff in America over his stand against illegal immigration, said the Walkers had described themselves as 'swingers'.

According to the arrest report Aucker said he had been involved with Dae for a month and she had expressed her desire to have sex with a dog.

Last year Sheriff Arpaio wrote to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster after the arrest of two people for using the website to solicit dogs for sex.

Arpaio asked for closer monitoring of the site, but said after the latest arrest: 'I remain extremely disappointed in the leadership at Craigslist.com for refusing to do what they can to stop this.

'While they aren't doing anything to stop it, I will continue to enforce all animal cruelty laws.'
