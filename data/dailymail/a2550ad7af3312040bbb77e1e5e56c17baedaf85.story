Wall Street is known for the Charging Bull of Broadway, but on Tuesday night it was all about a cash cow.

Chilean artist Sebastian Errazuriz filled a giant golden calf pinata full of dollar bills - $1,000 worth to be precise.

He then handed gallery goers large sticks and set them loose to beat the 15ft high and 24ft long glittering beast until the cash fell from the sky.

The visitors then scrambled to get their hands on the free money, as it tumbled from the cash cow - a mythic symbol of wealth and greed.

'It's a golden calf from the Bible, a false idol, the Bull of Wall Street,' Errazuriz said from Industry City warehouses in Brooklyn's Sunset Park.

The interactive art sculpture, called 'XXth Century Capital' or The Giant Golden Pinata, was created as a commission for Wanted Design Fair to inaugurate the opening of the NYC x Design event.

Pinata: The giant pinata was on view to the public in Industry City, Brooklyn, and saw them invited to grab as much of the cash as they could when it was smashed open at 5p.m.

In the stark critique of capitalism, the crowd took turns whacking the bull with broomsticks that, for added effect, were wrapped in Communist-red tape.

Finally, just after 5p.m., the spectacular animal's under belly gave way, and the rain began to fall into outstretched arms.Â 

Visitors were invited to grab as much of the cash as they could.

According to the New York Daily News, a tall member of the crowd was ushered out of the way to make room for a small girl who was being lifted up so she could reach the dollars.

Sunset Park High School student Kamylle Morency told the Daily News she scored $33 before she was knocked over by the boisterous group.

'I thought that people were going to be nice - money was going to be falling from the sky,' she told the newspaper. But she added: 'Somebody pushed me to the floor.'

Errazuriz felt the moral of his work came across as intended.

'It's a symbol of capitalism that they're tearing down,' he said. 'But then they're chasing the capitalism.'
