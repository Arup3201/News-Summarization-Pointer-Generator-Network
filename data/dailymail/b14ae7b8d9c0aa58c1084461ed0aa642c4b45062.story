Crystal Palace players are surprised Alan Pardew has decided to take over at Selhurst Park after his achievements at Newcastle.

Joe Ledley thinks he and his team-mates are 'lucky' to be under the charge of the 53-year-old, who was named Premier League manager of the month in November.

Pardew was officially announced as the new Palace boss on Saturday, completing a move that initially shocked many but became clearer when the circumstances of his working conditions on Tyneside emerged.

Pardew was officially unveiled as Palace boss on Saturday after his move from Newcastle was finalised

At Palace, Pardew will have greater control on transfers and enjoy a heathier relationship with the club's fans, who remember his winning goal in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool.

Palace travel to Dover Athletic on Sunday in a potential FA Cup banana skin, before focussing on Premier League survival from their position in the bottom three.

'We are looking forward to working under Alan and I think we have a bright future ahead of us,' said Ledley. 

'He came in at the end of the New Year's Day game and said 'Congratulations.' He told us what he wants to do with the squad which is move it forwards. He's very experienced in the Premier League. We will take his views on board and go from there.

Midfielder Ledley, here in the 0-0 stalemate against Aston Villa on New Year's Day, said Palace have a 'bright future ahead' under former Selhurst star Pardew

'I think it's a great appointment. I think we are lucky to be working under him. He has been brilliant for Newcastle. He's done such a good job that I think everyone was a bit surprised he's come. But it's a good appointment and it's down to us players now to perform.

'For us players, it's going to give us a big lift. The fans are going to be happy, so hopefully we can start putting a few good performances in.

'Tony Pulis brought me in and did a fantastic job. I thought he would be here for a long time. Things didn't work out and that's football. Hopefully we have the right man who will be here for many years to come. I think that's what the club needs.'

Dover, of the Vanarama Conference, are unbeaten in 16 games and Ledley expects a real test. 'Everyone expects us to win. It's not as easy as that. They are playing against a Premier League team and hopefully we can match them for enthusiasm and put on a performance.

'It's going to be hard with the number of games we have played and the circumstances. But it could be a confidence-boost. It's going to be very difficult.'
