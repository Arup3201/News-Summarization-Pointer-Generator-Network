A 16-year-old schoolboy died last night after collapsing while playing five-a-side football with friends.

Philip Lamin, of Bexleyheath, south-east London, is thought to have had a heart attack while playing in a friendly at a local Goals Soccer Centre, which is used by his school Bexleyheath Academy.

Principal Carl Wakefield praised Philip as ‘one of the most gifted sportsmen in his year’ and said his fellow students have decided that a quiet area of school grounds should be dedicated in his memory.

Mr Wakefield said: ‘It is with great sadness that we have to confirm the tragic loss of a much loved student who collapsed on a football pitch on the grounds of Bexleyheath Academy after school.

‘Philip Lamin, a 16-year-old student, was taking part in a friendly game of football when he fell to the ground (at approximately 4pm). There was no form of contact with any other player.

‘The ambulance service was immediately called and paramedics arrived within 10 minutes and attempts were made to resuscitate him at the scene.’

Philip was pronounced dead at 6pm at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, south-east London.

Mr Wakefield added: ‘Philip was a lovely lad who was very popular with his fellow students and with staff. He was one of the most gifted sportsmen in his year. He had a wonderful smile.

'I can't believe that I've heard that this guy is gone. Philip Lamin - the guy that was always cracking jokes, especially on the football pitch during church matches'

‘Students and staff are shocked and deeply saddened by the news. All students have been informed of our grievous loss at assemblies this morning and have been a credit to the Academy.’

Tributes poured in for Philip today from friends and fellow pupils on social networking websites.

Edwards said on Facebook: ‘I can't believe that I've heard that this 
guy is gone. Philip Lamin - the guy that was always cracking jokes, 
especially on the football pitch during church matches.

‘He always made me laugh. You were 
growing up to be a great man. You've made your mum so proud. We thank 
God for the progress you've made in life. We'll all miss you dearly.’

And Leanne Smith said on Twitter: 'Rest 
in peace, Philip Lamin - you'll never be forgotten. Such a nice boy. Why
you? This world's so cruel. Only saw you today (Tuesday).'

Another Twitter user named 'NothingLikeUs' said: 'So sad to think that someone who used to make the whole class laugh is now gone - remember you for them times. RIP Philip Lamin.'

The death was not being treated as suspicious but an inquest was due to be opened and adjourned at Southwark Coroner’s Court.

A Goals Soccer Centres spokesman told MailOnline today: 'Goals Soccer Centres is saddened by the tragic death of Philip
Lamin.

'He collapsed while taking part in a school extra-curricular activity at
our site at the Bexleyheath Academy. Our condolences go to his family and loved
ones.’

Meanwhile it was also revealed that a 47-year-old man also suffered a cardiac arrest at around 9pm 
last night while playing at the same Goals Soccer Centre - just hours after the schoolboy collapsed.

He was taken to King’s College Hospital in Camberwell, south-east London, where he was recovering.

Dear Parent/Carer

It is with great sadness that we have to confirm the tragic loss of a much loved student who collapsed on a football pitch on the grounds of Bexleyheath Academy yesterday.

Philip Lamin, a 16 year old student in Year 11, was taking part in a friendly game of football when he fell to the ground. There was no form of contact with any other player during this time.

The ambulance service were called immediately and paramedics arrived within ten minutes. Attempts were made to resuscitate Philip at the scene as well as at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich. Sadly he was pronounced dead at approximately 6pm.

Philip was a fine young man who was very popular with his fellow students and staff.  He was an extremely gifted and talented sportsman and was blessed with a wonderful smile.

Students and staff are understandably shocked and deeply saddened by this terrible news.  All students have been informed in special assemblies this morning.

Their behaviour and attitude displayed have been a credit to the Academy, their families and, above all else, themselves. The students have already dedicated a quiet area in the Academy to the memory of Philip.

Please do not hesitate to contact the Academy at any time over the next few days should you feel your child requires extra support and you deem it necessary.

We are very grateful for the exceptional support offered by the London Borough of Bexley and for the tremendous amount of messages of condolence sent through to us at this very difficult time.

Yours sincerelyMr C WakefieldPrincipal
