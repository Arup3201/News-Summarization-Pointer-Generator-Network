A young driver revved the engine of his car so much as a bizarre ‘tribute’ to late film star Paul Walker that it burst into flames.

Niall Kinghorn was at a car rally paying respects to the Fast and Furious actor, who died in November last year, when his Ford Focus caught fire.

He had been warned to stop revving the car by a crowd of onlookers at the Beach Boulevard car park in Aberdeen but he ignored them.

The 20-year-old admitted recklessly revving his car, causing it to catch fire to the danger of others, when he appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.

Sheriff Richard McFarlane called Kinghorn’s actions ‘crass stupidity’.

The sheriff said: ‘I simply do not know what to make of this. You get together with auto enthusiasts. Part of the get-together was to pay respects to a deceased actor.

‘I have never heard of respects in this regard as to what you did on this occasion. 

'Presumably you are counting your blessings that no other damage was sustained to other people’s property and there was no injury to any other participants.’

A court heard that Niall Kinghorn was with other car enthusiasts at the Beach Boulevard Retail Park in Aberdeeen as a tribute to the late Fast and Furious actor Paul Walker, pictured

Kinghorn was with other car enthusiasts at the Beach Boulevard Retail Park on December 14 when he started to rev the engine of his Ford Focus.

Fiscal depute Karen Dow said: ‘During the evening on the Saturday, the accused was at an event organised as a tribute to a deceased actor. At 10pm the organiser and his partner heard a noise of a car engine revving excessively.

‘Although not unusual it continued for several minutes and it drew a large crowd.’

The organiser of the rally came across Kinghorn surrounded by crowds who were watching him continue to rev the engine.

The apprentice joiner’s car bonnet was open and witnesses could see the engine was glowing red.

The court heard that he was warned to stop revving the engine just before it caught fire – shooting flames up in the midst of the crowd.

Kinghorn was later interviewed by police and charged.

Defence agent Peter Shepherd said: ‘The car burnt out. He was showing off or something. When he was told he went too far - it was too late.’

Sheriff McFarlane fined Kinghorn £750. Kinghorn refused to comment as he left court.

Mr Walker, 40, was killed when a friend’s Porsche crashed and burst into flames in Los Angeles.
