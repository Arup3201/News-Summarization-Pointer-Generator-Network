Five-months-pregnant Savannah Guthrie picked apart her body in a 360-degree mirror on the Today show this morning, telling viewers how her 'boobs are huge' and she's not fond of her arms because they're 'flabtastic.'

However, the 42-year-old added that she loves her growing baby bump because its reminds her how 'remarkable' the human body is and how 'lucky' she is to get a chance at motherhood.

Her Today show co-hosts also had a turn in the 'hall of mirrors', with Natalie Morales, 41, focusing on her wrinkles, Al Roker, 59, on his 'man boobs' and 'turkey waddle' neck, Matt Lauer, 56, on his thinning physique and Carson Daly, 40, on the opposite problem.

'I'd like to be a little smaller,' the father-of-two said surveying himself.

'I'd like to wave the wand and lose my insatiable appetite for alcohol 
and eating fine meals.

'I like to indulge, and I think I would like to be
 able to curb that a little bit more and have a little more discipline. 
but what the hell.'

Signs of aging: Natalie Morales, 41, said she can't help but focus on her wrinkles when she looks in the mirror

Toning up: Al Roker, 59, said he would like his 'man boobs' to be able to 'perform tricks'

Fading away: Matt Lauer, 56, feels like he's getting skinnier the older he gets

Filling out: Carson Daly however, feels like he should be cutting back on his indulgent lifestyle

The news anchors talked about their reflections in light of new research by Dove showing that women spend an average of 50 minutes in front of the mirror each day.

Ms Guthrie says that people who are most obsessed with their reflections are likely to be the most insecure.

'There's a perception that if someone looks in the 
mirror a lot, they really love themselves,' she said.

'[But] I think if you see someone who's constantly looking at their 
reflection, if it's a woman, more likely than not, they're thinking, why do i look this way? i need to put some lipstick on.'

The expectant mother, who is set to give birth in August, admitted that catching an unflattering glimpse of herself can make her 'grumpy all day.'

And Mr Daly said that he also dislikes mirrors and tends to avoid them.

'I see myself and I feel very
 uncomfortable. I don't like looking at myself, because it doesn't match
 up with how I feel.'

However, Mr Roker seemed more relaxed with himself, merely saying that he sees a 'bald', 'African-American' guy 'you know, approaching 60.'

He jokingly added that he would it like his 'man boobs . . could move on their own, perform tricks, fill out taxes.'

But concluded: 'You know, it is what it is. that's what's there . . . I just want to make sure the fly [on my pants] is zipped. Everything's tucked in.'
