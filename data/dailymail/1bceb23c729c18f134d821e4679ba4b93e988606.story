President Bashar Assad will be 'euphoric' about Obama's decision to wait for Congress over Syria, according to Senator John McCain.

One of the loudest critics of the administration's handling of Syria, McCain criticised Obama in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation.

Referring to Obama's famous remark when he said the use of chemical weapons in Syria would cross a red line, McCain said: 'He didn't say, "It's a red line - and by the way I'm going to have to seek the approval of Congress." He said it was a red line, and that the United States of America would act.

'And that's a big difference, and that's one of the reasons why this is so problematic.'

Tension: President Bashar Assad will be 'euphoric' about Obama's decision to wait for Congress over Syria, according to Sen. John McCain

Crisis talks: President Obama and Vice-President Biden meet with Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security Advisor Susan Rice to discuss Syria on Sunday

The Arizona Republican, who Obama beat for the presidency in 2008, said the President asked him to come to the White House
 specifically to discuss Syria.

Obama
 is hoping one of Congress's most intractable foreign policy hawks will 
help sell the idea of a U.S. military intervention in Syria to a nation 
deeply scarred by more than a decade of war.

Having
 announced over the weekend that he will seek congressional approval for 
military strikes against the Assad regime, the Obama administration is 
now trying to rally support among Americans and their congressmen and 
senators.

The
 head of the U.N. refugee agency in Syria says seven  million Syrians, 
or almost one-third of the population, have been displaced by the 
country's civil war.

Tarik
 Kurdi said that five million of the displaced are still in Syria while 
about 2 million have fled to neighboring countries.

He says two million children are among those directly affected by the war.

Kurdi
 says U.N. assistance has been a 'drop in the sea of humanitarian need' 
and that the funding gap is 'very, very wide.' He says international 
donors have sent less than one-third of the money needed to help those 
displaced by the war.

More than 100,000 Syrians have been killed since an uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad erupted in 2011.

Monday's 
meeting with McCain is meant to address concerns of those who feel Obama
 isn't doing enough to punish Syrian President Bashar Assad's government
 for an attack in the Damascus suburbs last month that the U.S. says 
included sarin gas and killed at least 1,429 civilians, more than 400 of
 whom were children. 

On the other side of the spectrum, some Republican 
and Democratic lawmakers don't want to see military action at all.

Obama's turnabout on Syria sets the stage for the biggest foreign policy vote in Congress since the Iraq war.

On
 Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. received new 
physical evidence in the form of blood and hair samples that shows sarin
 gas was used in the August 21 attack. Kerry said the U.S. must respond 
with its credibility on the line.

'We
 know that the regime ordered this attack,' he said. 'We know they 
prepared for it. We know where the rockets came from. We know where they
 landed. We know the damage that was done afterwards.'

Kerry's assertion coincided with the beginning of a forceful administration appeal for congressional support.

On
 Capitol Hill, senior administration officials briefed lawmakers in 
private to explain why the U.S. was compelled to act against Assad.

Debate: The President meets national security advisers  to discuss possible military action

Contact: Barack Obama called members of the House of Representatives to rally support

Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough also made calls to individual lawmakers.

Further
 classified meetings were planned from Monday to Wednesday. The Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee plans a meeting Tuesday, according to its 
chairman, Senator Bob Menendez, D-N.J.

The Senate Armed Service Committee will gather a day later, said Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the panel.

Split: Protesters for and against military action confront each other outside the White House

Call for action: Protesters demanding military action shout over those opposing it at joint rallies in Washington DC on Sunday

In
 an interview with an Israeli television network, he said Obama has 
'encouraged our enemies' by effectively punting his decision to 
Congress. He and fellow Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South
 Carolina have threatened to vote against Obama's authorization if the 
military plan doesn't seek to shift the momentum of the two year civil war toward the rebels trying to oust Assad from power.

Obama is trying to convince Americans and the world about the need for action.

So

 far, he is finding few international partners willing to engage in a 
conflict that has claimed more than 100,000 lives in the past two years 
and dragged in terrorist groups on both sides of the battlefield.

Only
 France is firmly on board among the major military powers. Britain's 
Parliament rejected the use of force in a vote last week.

Innocents: According to U.S. estimates, of the 1,429 killed in the attack, 426 were children

Responsibility: French agents say Assad's regime is behind the nerve gas attack in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus on August 21

With
 Navy ships on standby in the eastern Mediterranean ready to launch 
missiles, Congress on Sunday began a series of meetings that are 
expected to continue over the next several days in preparation for a 
vote once lawmakers return from summer break, which is scheduled to end 
September 9. 

Senior administration officials gave a two-hour classified briefing to dozens of members of Congress in the Capitol on Sunday.

Lawmakers
 expressed a range of opinions coming out of the meeting, from outright 
opposition to strident support for Obama's request for the authorization
 to use force.

Among 
Democrats, Sander Levin of Michigan said he'd approve Obama's 
request and predicted it would pass.

Elijah Cummings of Maryland 
said he was concerned the authorization might be 'too broad.'

Pressing issue: The President briefs senior advisers about the situation in Syria

Bennie G. Thompson, the senior Democrat on the House Homeland Security 
Committee, said the administration still has 'work to do with respect to
 shoring up the facts of what happened.'

Republican
 Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington said she was concerned about 
what Congress was being asked to approve. Senator Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., 
said the war resolution needed tightening.

'I don't think Congress is going to accept it as it is,' Sessions said.

Meanwhile Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says the information the U.S. showed Moscow trying to prove that the Syrian regime was behind an alleged chemical weapons attack is 'absolutely unconvincing.'

Lavrov said Monday 'there was nothing specific' in the evidence presented by Washington: 'no geographic coordinates, no names, no proof that the tests were carried out by the professionals.' He did not say what tests he was referring to.

Lavrov say U.S. officials said they cannot share with them all the evidence because some of it is classified.

Firm:  Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov  said evidence of alleged chemical weapons use by the Syrian regime presented to Moscow by the U.S. and its allies is 'absolutely unconvincing'

Today Russia's foreign minister said evidence of alleged chemical weapons use by the Syrian regime presented to Moscow by the U.S. and its allies is 'absolutely unconvincing'.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said 'there was nothing specific there, no geographic coordinates, no names, no proof that the tests were carried out by the professionals.'

He did not describe the tests further.

Lavrov brushed aside Western evidence of an alleged Syrian regime role. Russia, along with China and Iran, has staunchly backed Assad throughout the conflict.

'What our American, British and French partners showed us in the past and have showed just recently is absolutely unconvincing,' Lavrov said at Russia's top diplomatic school.

'And when you ask for more detailed proof they say all of this is classified so we cannot show this to you.'

U.N. chemical inspectors toured the stricken areas last week, collecting biological and soil samples, but it is not clear when the will present their findings.

The Syria conflict erupted in March 2011 as an uprising against Assad that quickly transformed into a civil war.

More than 100,000 Syrians have been killed in the conflict.
