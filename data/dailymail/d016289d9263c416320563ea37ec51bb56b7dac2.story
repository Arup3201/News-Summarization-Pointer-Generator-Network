Vogue Hommes International is no stranger to controversial covers.

The fashion magazine caused a stir when they shot a male model seemingly choking his female counterpart for their September cover last year, which advocacy groups claimed glamorized domestic violence.

And now they have splashed male model Jarrod Scott across the pages of their spring/summer 2013 issue - completely in the nude.

Steamy: Vogue Hommes International exposes model Jarrod Scott in all his glory, as the pages unfold, his clothes disappear (cover has been cropped here)

Posing on the cover of the magazine with a jacket draped over his naked torso, the model has his hand down his open trousers with his hand inside. Twitter users were quick to comment on the hair visible around his open flies.

In many of the editorial shots within the Paris-based magazine - which were shot by acclaimed photographer Sølve Sundsbø - the Australian-born model wears clothes by from Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Dolce & Gabbana and Hermes.

But as the shoot progresses it becomes a strip-tease, with each image showing Scott in a further state of undress, until he is completely naked.

Speaking about his debut cover shoot, he told Vogue Paris: 'It's amazing because I never see myself in this way.'

When
 asked about posing in the nude, he added: 'It was more towards the end 
of the day, and it was talked about a lot, but I thought: "I'll do it 
anyway."'

One writer at FashionCopious was quick to comment: 'I mean what straight guy, myself included, would be attracted to a cover like this; or would want to see Jarrod Scott's penis?'

Twitter users were also shocked, with journalist Grace Dent tweeting: my EYES, MY EYES!' after spotting the shoot.

Another tweet read: 'Jarrod Scott @FordModels looking like that on the cover of Vogue Hommes Intl is hurting my feelings.'

Twitter reaction: The Twittersphere were shocked and impressed in equal measure

The Fashion Law tweeted: 'I wonder how much Jarrod Scott got paid to go completely naked for the latest Vogue Hommes International.'

Scott+, who is of Italian/German decent, broke into the modelling industry after being scouted by a photographer while on holiday in the Philippines.

He launched his international modelling career walking for Givenchy AW12 in January and has since shot Vogue Hommes International with David Sims with many tipping him for great success this year.

MailOnline is awaiting comment from Vogue Homme International.
