The Prince of Wales is to guest edit a special edition of the BBC One flagship Countryfile programme as part of its 25th anniversary celebrations.

Charles will talk about his passion for the countryside in interviews with Countryfile presenters Julia Bradbury and Matt Baker and will also explain his choices for the special edition of the weekly rural affairs programme.

The programme will show Charles as he visits his rural initiatives aimed at improving the lives of people working in the countryside and will feature his organic farm in Gloucestershire.

Charles will also be shown visiting a south London school that has seen examination results improve after helping pupils reconnect with the soil by growing their own vegetables.

Speaking at the Oxford farming conference last month Charles said: 'Is it not quite revealing that the BBC's Countryfile programme has become so tremendously popular?

'Ever since they moved it to its prime-time slot on a Sunday night, it has become one of their most successful television programmes, with over seven million viewers a week.

'There is evidently a thirst for the countryside and for the culture it represents.'

Bill Lyons, Countryfile executive editor said: 'Farming has shaped the landscape and identity of modern Britain and rural business contributes massively to the UK economy, but changing times throw up challenging questions.

'Through the work of his many rural initiatives and his Prince's Countryside Fund, The Prince of Wales deals at first hand with many of the issues on Countryfile's agenda.

'As we celebrate our 25th year, we look forward to this special edition of Countryfile, which will bring the Prince's passion and perspective to this hugely popular programme.'

Danny Cohen, controller of BBC One, said: 'It's wonderful to have Prince Charles as guest editor of Countryfile.

'It'll be a very special programme for BBC One and I look forward to it.'

The edition of Countryfile with The Prince of Wales as guest-editor will air on BBC One and BBC One HD next month.
