It's the financial event that sees the biggest names in world banking overrun  the tiny Alpine town of Davos each year.

But while the World Economic Forum is famous for its financiers and politicians, this year has seen a sprinkling of royal stardust as well.

Among the royals to visit the event, which closes today, are King Phillippe and Queen Mathilde of the Belgians, the glamorous Queen Rania of Jordan and Crown Prince Haakon of Norway.

First arrival: Jordan's glamorous Queen Rania was among the first of the royal contingent to arrive

First to arrive was 44-year-old Queen Rania, who regularly attends the event and last year made a speech on the subject of boosting employment.

A board member at the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA), the Kuwait-born royal has long taken an interest in microfinance initiatives.

The royal, who has been tweeting updates from the Forum over the past few days, took a break from this morning to comment on the death of Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah.

'Arab and Muslim nations grieve loss of HM King Abdullah,' she wrote. 'Our condolences to the Saudi people for HM's sad passing. May he rest in peace.'

But although one of the most prominent, Rania isn't the only royal to hobnob with financiers in Davos this week.

On her way: Queen Mathilde of the Belgians arrived in Davos by private plane

Taking an interest: She and her husband King Philippe of the Belgians heard the opening panel discussions

Veteran: Mathilde, 42, is a World Economic Forum veteran and has been attending the event since 2007

Relaxed: The Belgian royals also met Klaus Schwab, the German economist who founded the Forum

One of the most headline-grabbing arrivals was made by King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of the Belgians, who arrived by private jet on Wednesday as the event swung into top gear.

The couple, who have been on the throne of Belgium since 2013, stayed for just two days but took part in the opening panel discussions before flying home.

42-year-old Mathilde is no stranger to Davos, having attended each year since 2007, and looked at ease while meeting dignitaries, including German financier Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum.

Other royals to attend include Prince Andrew, who hosted a reception on behalf of his entrepreneurship charity, Pitch@Palace, last night.

Crown Prince Haakon of Norway and his wife Mette-Marit were among the last royals to arrive, flying into Davos yesterday.

Expected: Spain's Queen Letizia is expected to arrive at the event before it comes to a close

Busy: Letizia and husband King Felipe have had a busy week and have completed several visits in Spain

The 41-year-old prince sits on the board of the affiliated Forum of Young Global Leaders and, with his 41-year-old wife, has taken part in a number of meetings.

According to the Norwegian Royal Court, Haakon and Mette-Marit hope to 'bring themselves up to date on a range of current issues'.

The final set of royals to arrive at the Alpine town are Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia, both of whom are due to arrive today.

Both of the Spanish royals have already had a busy week, with a reception for foreign ambassadors at the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid and the opening of an art gallery already under their collective belt. 

Passionate: Emma Watson, 24, spoke out on the topic of women's rights during the Forum

She made headlines when she spoke out about women's rights during an impassioned speech made to the UN General Assembly last September.

Now Emma Watson has repeated the trick - this time in front of politicians and financiers assembled at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Sitting beside UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, the 24-year-old spoke passionately about the HeForShe IMPACT initiative, which she is has championed and which aims to empower women across the world. 

'The groundswell of response we have received in support for HeForShe tells us we are tapping into what the world wants: to be a part of change,' she said.

'Now we have to channel that energy into purposeful action. The pilot initiative provides that framework. 

'Next we need all country leadership, as well as that of hundreds of universities and corporations to follow HeForShe's IMPACT 10x10x10 so as to bring an end to the persisting inequalities faced by women and girls globally.'

World leaders to have signalled their support for the initiative include Paul Kagame of Rwanda, Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone and Sweden's new Prime Minister, Stefan Lofven.
