A woman from Kansas City is speaking out about an attack that nearly killed her. 

Marti Hill said wants others to know about what she had to go through, in the hope the knowledge may stop it happening to someone else.

It was early one morning in September 2010 when a handyman came round to Ms Hill's house.

She knew him from previous jobs in the past, but Brian Pennington claimed he wanted to show her a couple of things that needed finishing in the basement.

Sharing her story: Marti Hill, who survived a brutal attack by her handyman is sharing her story publicly in hopes of empowering young women

Brutal: Marti eventually passed out as Pennington stabbed her multiple times and left her for dead

Long recovery: It would be 12 days before she would wake up in a hospital bed. She had trauma to her brain and lacerations to her throat

'I'm kind of talking and I remember distinctively him not saying anything at all,' she said. 

'We get to the bottom of the stairs, he grabs my throat and I'm just very taken, and I'm trying to look around and I can't turn, I can't look.'

Pennington tried to strangle her.

In jail: Brian Pennington is serving 28 years in prison

'I kept saying, 'What are you doing? What are you doing?' and it came to a point where my voice just faded and I felt myself dropping and passed out,' Ms Hill said to KMBC.

Police were called after she failed to show up for work. She was alive, but barely.

Pennington had stabbed her in the neck.

For a time it was not clear if she would live or die. Family kept a constant vigil at her hospital bedside.  

It was another 12 days before she was able to full wake up and inform police who had committed the brutal assault.

Years on, Ms. Hill is still feeling the affects of that fateful morning and still hears an echo in her ear when she speaks.

'My ear feels very full. The side of my face feels like a mannequin, it's kind of numb and tingly all the way down the left side,' she said. 

Ms. Hill now speaks to small groups and tells them about the event the almost end  her life.

He message to those who listen are for people to trust their instincts if something doesn't feel right.  

Unexplained  In September 2010, Pennington came to Hill's Prairie Village home and said he needed to fix a problem in her basement. He never did explain why he attacked Ms. Hill

Rescued: A co-worker alerted police when she didn't show up for work, which allowed her to get found quickly and saved her life

'When someone's asked you to do something awkward like that, to walk to the basement, it's OK to say, 'No,' or, 'Come back,'' she said. 

'Learning that, you know, we don't all think the same,' she said. 'I kind of thought we all just tried to be the best we could be and there are people that are not thinking that at all.'

Pennington pleaded guilty and is serving 28 years in prison for attempted murder but has never once explain why he acted the way he did.

Looking forward: Hill still wonders why he attacked her, but she knows she will never get an answer. Instead, she focuses on helping other women
