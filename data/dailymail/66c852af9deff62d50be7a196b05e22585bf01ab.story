Sir Alex Ferguson made more than £2million during his first eight months in boardroom roles at Manchester United, accounts reveal.

The former manager's 26-year reign in charge of the football team came to an end in 2013, when he became a director and global ambassador for the club.

Club accounts now reveal his reported £100,000-a-day roles allowed him to make £2,165,000 between October 2013 and June last year.

The former manager tried to keep a low profile during his first season away from management, for fear he would overshadow his replacement David Moyes, who was sacked after a season in charge.

But the club were keen to use Sir Alex's world-famous status to promote the Manchester United brand around the globe.

He has travelled the world in his role, with duties including the unveiling of Park Ji-Sung as another ambassador for the club last October.

Park became one of five other ambassadors working alongside Sir Alex, joining former greats Sir Bobby Charlton, Andrew Cole, Denis Law and Bryan Robson.

Ferguson topped football's managerial rich list shortly before his retirement, when his estimated £7million-a-year from United while he was manager led his estimated worth to be £34million.

The club's accounts show the Scotsman - known for his team's 'Fergie time' goals at the end of matches - is being well rewarded for his continued work at United.

Ferguson also has other sources of income, making at least £1million from sales of his autobiography and more than £2million selling off part of his wine collection last year.

He also has a number of other roles he carries out, having been appointed to a teaching position at Harvard University in the US and heading an elite coaches forum for European footballing body Uefa.

The same accounts show Sir Bobby Charlton was also paid by United in 2013-14 for ‘consultancy services’, although he made just £105,000.

A spokesman for Manchester United said: 'Sir Alex has been employed as an ambassador for the club, providing support to the club as directed from time to time. As was the case during his time as manager, his contract is a private matter between the club and Sir Alex.'
