A driver for the wildly popular car service app Uber has been arrested after a passenger woke up in a motel room miles from her home.

Police said Frederick Dencer, 32, took off his shirt and 'fondled' through the 26-year-old's clothes after driving her 17 miles from a nightclub in West Hollywood, California.

She rejected his advances and dialled 911 from a nearby convenience store the next morning, they said - and when officers arrived Dencer was still in the room.

Motel: Police say a woman woke up in this motel in Panorama City, California, after being given a ride by Uber driver Frederick Dencer, 32. He was arrested on suspicion of kidnap for the purpose of sexual assault

Distance: The woman had been at the Greystone Manor nightclub in West Hollywood, 17 miles away. Police said the booking was not made through normal channels and the woman could not remember her address

The driver was arrested on suspicion of kidnap for the purpose of sexual assault. No actual sexual assault allegation was made.

'Once in the car she couldn't express her address, where she lived', LAPD Lt Paul Vernon told ABC7.

'He ends up taking her to this motel miles from her home, miles from his home... There
 was some fondling through her clothes, suggesting what he wanted.

'She 
said no, and in the morning when she awoke and she wanted to leave he 
did not stop her from leaving.

'After several stories he confirms that he is an Uber driver.'

The woman had ended her night at the Greystone Manor nightclub in West Hollywood after a night drinking in bars.

It was initially thought she had called the car share service herself.

However, investigators believe staff at the nightclub may have hailed down Dencer after he dropped off another fare as a means for her to get home.

Investigation: LAPD Lt Paul Vernon said it was believed the woman was unable to articulate her address

Route: Police said the woman was taken from the Greystone Manor nightclub to the Panorama Motel

That would mean he had not been given her home address through the firm - and if she had been unable to articulate it herself, he would not know where to take her, Lt Vernon said.

Police said surveillance video showed Dencer, from nearby Encino, carrying
 the woman into a room at the Panorama Motel in Panorama City.

Uber popular: Leaked figures suggest the car service app carries 800,000 people a week

They claimed he 'took advantage of the situation'.

Uber said it has suspended the account of Dencer, who was held in custody with bail of $1million.

A statement released by the firm said: 'The facts are unknown at this stage and it's certainly unclear that this is an Uber-related incident.

'We have reached out to authorities and will work with them to help uncover the facts.

'It is also our policy to immediately suspend a driver's account following any serious allegations, which we have done. Nothing is more important to Uber than the safety of our riders.'

The car service app has soared in popularity in the four years since it launched in San Francisco.

It uses networks of drivers in major cities and allows users to book a taxi with the touch of a button on their smartphone.

Its meteoric rise has led to criticism in some countries where it has been accused of undercutting the established taxi industry.

In London, experienced drivers of traditional black cabs - who have to study for several years to memorise every street in the city - complained it could put them out of business.

Figures leaked to TechCrunch in December suggested the app, which has now spread to 36 countries, was regularly pulling in more than 800,000 rides a week.

MailOnline has contacted Uber for comment.
