A man who bludgeoned his wife with a pair of bolt cutters then sat down and drank a beer before he called emergency services.

Troy Jay Power, 50, pleaded guilty to attacking Penelope Power on July 3, 2012.

The couple had been married for 30 years but in the past two years leading up to the attack they had been living in separate bedrooms. Ms Power had started living somewhere else for the majority of the week.

Troy Jay Power attacked his wife of 30 years with a pair of bolt cutters (similar to the ones pictured) while she was on the toilet

The Mandurah man appeared in Western Australia's Supreme Court on Friday.

The court heard he had asked Ms Power to come to their Dudley Park home on Dadger Street to talk about their separation. He was angry because he believed she was seeing someone else.

She had gone to the bathroom when Power forced the door open and struck her repeatedly on the head and face with the bolt cutters, while screaming: 'I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill myself. I'm not going to jail for anyone.'

Ms Power made her way to the lounge room as the attack continued. At one point, Power pushed her to the ground and kicked her.

Before he called 000 to raise the alarm, Power grabbed a beer and then threw the phone at Ms Power

As she lay on the floor bleeding and severely injured, Power asked: 'Do you want me to ring an ambulance, or do you want to die?'

Ms Power said she wanted an ambulance, but he replied with: 'I will have another beer, and I will think about it.'

After he got a beer, Power dialled 000 and, after speaking with an operator, threw the phone at his wife.

The court heard that Ms Power was so frightened of what her husband might do if she told the truth that she claimed an intruder had attacked her.

The Mandurah man appeared in WA's Supreme Court and pleaded guilty to the Dudley Park attack on Friday

In 2012, Mandurah Mail reported Ms Power had to undergo surgery for her injuries.

On Friday Commissioner Kevin Sleight told Power: 'Your wife believed that she was going to die.

'The callousness of your attack is not only demonstrated by the injuries you inflicted, but your response immediately after the attack, by the manner in which you offered her assistance.

'It is very fortunate that your wife did not die. The use of bolt cutters is an aggravating feature because, potentially, blows to the head using bolt cutters was life threatening.'

Power was sentenced to six years in prison and will be eligible for parole after four.
