Rebekah Brooks has been the victim of an unprecedented ‘witch-hunt’, her husband said yesterday, as the couple broke their silence over her dramatic acquittal in the phone-hacking trial.

The former News of the World editor said she had been ‘vindicated’ after suffering ‘a maelstrom of controversy, of politics and of comment’.

The 46-year-old insisted she was ‘incredibly proud’ of her campaigns as editor at the Sunday tabloid but appeared to acknowledge the pain caused to those whose phones were hacked by journalists, and that mistakes had been made.

'I am innocent': Rebekah Brooks, pictured with husband Charlie, has spoken for the first time after she was cleared of hacking charges at the Old Bailey

Speaking out: The former News International chief executive addressed reporters outside her London home

Ordeal: Surrounded by a media scrum outside the house, Mrs Brooks said the last three years had been 'tough' for her, her husband and those close to them

Support: Mr Brooks today paid tribute to the 'dignity' his wife had shown throughout a three-year 'witch-hunt'

‘I am innocent of the crimes that I was charged with and I feel vindicated by the unanimous verdicts,’ she said.

‘The
 last few years have been tough for both of us and those closest to us, 
but more importantly they have been tough for everybody, on all sides 
that have been affected by the issues  raised by this case.’

Asked
 if she could have done more to prevent phone hacking at the News of the
 World, Mrs Brooks told journalists: ‘It’s been a time of reflection for
 me. I’ve learned some valuable lessons and will hopefully become the 
wiser for it.’ 

Response: Mrs Brooks, 46, made no direct reference to Andy Coulson as she faced a barrage of questions from reporters

'Vindicated': Mrs Brooks said she was innocent of all the crimes she was charged with, and felt 'vindicated' by the jury's unanimous verdicts

Perspective: Mrs Brooks said the trial had made her grateful for her 'happy and healthy' daughter, and the support of her mother

Grateful: Mrs Brooks said she was grateful to the jury following their decision to clear her of all charges

It was 
the first time Mrs Brooks and her husband Charlie, 51, had spoken 
publicly about the hacking scandal since they were charged in May 2012.

Back
 then Mrs Brooks condemned her prosecution as ‘nothing more than an 
expensive sideshow, a waste of public money as a result of an unjust and
 weak decision’, and her husband said she was ‘the subject of a 
witch-hunt’.

Yesterday Mr 
Brooks said he stood by his comments, saying: ‘Everything, absolutely 
everything we said, has been proved to be true.

‘Rebekah
 has been through an unprecedented investigation of an incredibly 
forensic and personal nature, the likes of which we have probably never 
seen.

‘And I would just like to say how proud I am of Rebekah and the dignity she has shown.’

Asked if he still believed the prosecution was a witch-hunt, he nodded emphatically and replied: ‘Yes.

Unity: The couple both spoke for the first time since the end of the hacking trial, which saw them and three others unanimously cleared of hacking charges. Andy Coulson was found guilty. Mrs Brooks was wearing a £180 'Edie' dress from Boutique by Jaeger, and carrying a £475 'Robinson' by Tory Burch tote-style bag.

Tough: Mrs Brooks' voice broke and she appeared to be close to tears as she gave the statement. She would not be drawn on Mr Coulson's fate or whether she should have done more to deal with criminality at the News of the World

Mr
 and Mrs Brooks spoke as they left the £5million townhouse in 
Clerkenwell, central London, which they had rented for the duration of 
the eight-month trial so that they would be close to the Old Bailey.

A
 tired-looking Mrs Brooks said they were desperate ‘to spend some 
much-needed time with Scarlett’, their two-year-old daughter. Scarlett 
was born in January 2012, just weeks before the couple were arrested.

Their
 trial heard how Mrs Brooks had been unable to conceive, despite 
fertility treatment, and Scarlett was born after a cousin agreed to a 
surrogate pregnancy.

She 
ignored questions about how she felt about the conviction of her former 
deputy editor and lover Andy Coulson, the only person found guilty at 
the trial.

Coulson, 46, who 
later became Prime Minister David Cameron’s director of communications 
in Downing Street, faces prison when he is sentenced next week alongside
 three former News of the World news editors and private detective Glenn
 Mulcaire.

Mr Brooks said he was ‘very sad’ for Coulson, his wife and their three young sons.

He said they had not heard from Mr Cameron – with whom they were close friends before the trial – since Tuesday’s acquittal.

Time of reflection: Mrs Brooks told the waiting reporters that she had 'learned some valuable lessons', and hopefully was 'the wiser for it'

Mixed emotions: At times Mrs Brooks smiled and at others she was close to tears, and said she would spend her time supporting her colleagues still on trial but would not be drawn on her own career going forward

Tribute: Mr Brooks, said he was already back working full time as a horse trainer, said his wife went 'through an unprecedented investigation of an incredibly forensic and personal nature, the likes of which we have probably never seen'

Back home: The couple said they were heading back to Oxfordshire to spend more time with their daughter

Mrs
 Brooks – who wore a £180 butterfly print Jaeger dress and carried a 
£475 Tony Burch ‘Robinson’ stripe tote bag – refused to answer any 
questions about her plans for the future.

She
 is known to have received  payouts totalling £16million following her 
resignation as chief executive at News International, although that was 
understood to include the legal fees for her defence.

She appeared to have memorised a lengthy statement and stared straight 
ahead as she spoke, although her legs were visibly shaking.

Asked
 about the journalists still facing trial whom she worked with at the 
News of the World and The Sun, she said: ‘I am incredibly proud of the 
many journalists I have worked with throughout my career and the great 
campaigns that we have fought and won.

‘All I can say to you all is that today my thoughts are with my former colleagues and their families who face future trials.

I am going to do everything I can to support them as I know how anxious the times ahead are.’
