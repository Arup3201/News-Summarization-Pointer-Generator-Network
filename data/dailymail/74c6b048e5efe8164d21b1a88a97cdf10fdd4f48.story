Charlize Theron sparked outrage last night by comparing media intrusion into her personal life to rape.

The South African actress, 38, was accused of cheapening the suffering of victims after she made the insensitive remarks in a TV interview.

The Oscar-winner was also branded a hypocrite because of her past as an anti-rape campaigner and for using a media appearance to make the comparison.

Courting controversy: Charlize Theron said she doesn't Google herself because 'it feels like being raped'

Appearing on Sky News – to promote her latest film – she was asked if she ever Googled herself. Miss Theron replied: ‘I don’t do that, so that’s my saving grace.

'When you start living in that world, and doing that, you start, I guess, feeling raped.’

The actress, who hours earlier had been photographed leaving Claridge’s hotel in London with her adopted son Jackson, two, and her partner, fellow Oscar-winner Sean Penn, 53, was then pushed on whether she really felt invasions of her privacy were equivalent to sexual violence.

Miss Theron replied: ‘Well, you know when it comes to your son and your private life. Maybe that’s just me.

Controversial: The Hollywood actress Charlize Theron has compared press intrusion to rape in an interview

2004: Defends her mother for shooting her alcoholic father dead in front of her in 1991, telling American TV channel ABC: ‘He was a verbal abuser… and I know that if my daughter was in the same situation, I would do the same thing.’ (To promote Monster)

2005: Tells Oprah Winfrey: ‘The way my father died was traumatic. I would wish for nothing more in my life than for it not to have happened the way it did. But I can’t change that.’ (Aeon Flux)

2008: Tells The Guardian: ‘I’m a sexual creature. There’s nothing wrong with that. Why do we have to be ashamed of being so many different things? Why do we have to be only one thing, a good mother or a hooker? I don’t think that what’s under my clothes is evil.’ (Hancock)

2010: On her desire to have children with then boyfriend Stuart Townsend: ‘I’m reaching the point where I want to be a mom and Stuart is the man I want to take that step with.’ (The Road)

2012: On adopting Jackson: ‘I always knew I would adopt. I don’t think any mother aims to be a single mum. I didn’t wish for that but it happened.’ (Snow White And The Huntsman and Prometheus)

2014: On marriage: ‘I never had the dream of the white dress. And watching other people getting married? I think it’s beautiful for them, but to be quite honest, usually I’m sitting there just devastated.’ (A Million Ways To Die In The West)

'Some people might relish all that 
stuff but there are certain things in my life that I think of as very 
sacred and I am very protective over them.’

Rape campaigners condemned the 
actress’s remarks, made while she was meant to be talking about her new 
film A Million Ways To Die In The West, a comedy western.

Others pointed out she has regularly used media interviews to offer up details of her personal life while promoting her films.

Karen Ingala Smith, chief executive of victim support charity Nia, which runs the East London Rape Crisis Service, said: ‘There’s one thing that’s like rape and that’s rape.

'It weakens what we understand as rape when we use that word inappropriately. It cheapens the aftermath of rape and it cheapens [victims’] suffering.

‘If Charlize Theron spent an afternoon listening to a rape crisis helpline she would understand very quickly that unwanted press attention is very different.’

Katie Russell from Rape Crisis England and Wales added that Miss Theron had no excuse for making comments that would ‘upset people who have survived attacks’.

She said: ‘It is always disappointing when someone high profile uses that language and turns sexual violence into a metaphor for something else.

‘It is never appropriate and it trivialises the experience of sexual violence.

‘It’s particularly disappointing in this case because Charlize Theron has campaigned against sexual violence before.’

Miss Theron has been involved in several anti-rape campaigns, including appearing in a South African advert in 1999 standing under a banner reading ‘Real men don’t rape’.

The actress, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of a serial killer in Monster, was also criticised on social media.

Mark Merryweather wrote: ‘How dare Charlize Theron compare press intrusion to rape – try telling a victim of rape that.’

Miss Theron is not the first celebrity to court criticism in this way. In 2010, Kristen Stewart apologised after telling a magazine that looking at paparazzi photos of herself was like ‘looking at someone being raped’.

In 2011, Johnny Depp said being photographed by the paparazzi makes ‘you just feel like you’re being raped somehow’. He later apologised.
