When he arrived at the Emirates Stadium in 2010, Marouane Chamakh was billed as the answer to Arsenal's striking problems.

With 79 goals in eight seasons in France he had never been a prolific goalscorer at Bordeaux, but the Moroccan offered Arsene Wenger a plan B. His hold-up play, and knack for scoring at important times, as shown by his five Champions League strikes the previous season, suggested that Chamakh provided something different.

Alongside Robin van Persie, and with the supply coming from Cesc Fabregas, Andrei Arshavin and Samir Nasri, Chamakh was expected to help the Gunners challenge for the title again.

After scoring 10 times in his first 21 Gunners appearances confidence was higher than ever, before the return of the previously injured Van Persie meant a spell on the bench, from which he never really recovered.

Three years, two loan moves and just one league goal later, Chamakh was allowed to leave, his confidence dented and his reputation in tatters.

Yet, as he prepares to face his former club again on Saturday, the Moroccan has remodelled his game into the type of player that could really hurt the Gunners.

Chamakh is no longer the Champions League standard striker he once was, but instead is a hard-working midfielder, who can play off the front man.

Chamakh's arrival, on a free transfer, was heralded as the potential for a new era of success at Arsenal

The 31-year-old has now moved to a more withdrawn role at his south London club, becoming a midfielder

Despite just one Premier League goal since joining Palace permanently this season, the 31-year-old has been a crucial part of the south London club’s plans.

On the opening day of the season, in his first meeting with Arsenal since departing the Emirates, he showed the Gunners what he can offer these days, winning five tackles, and seven aerial duels. 

More remarkably he also got away with 11 fouls, ten of which came before his 67th minute booking.

The goals soon dried up for the striker, who became second choice behind Robin van Persie

The converted striker was eventually booked for his tenth foul of the match, after upending Jack Wilshere 

In other words he became the kind of player Arsenal so often need – a nuisance, who opponents hate but fans love to have on their side.

When the Gunners travel to Selhurst Park on Saturday they can expect more of the same from the player who averages more fouls per game than anyone else in the Premier League. With Yaya Sanogo unavailable against his parent club, Chamakh is likely to continue in the first team.

And with his confidence returned – as demonstrated by two goals against Southampton last month - Arsene Wenger knows he faces a dangerous opponent.

‘He’s dropped off as well, he’s not the target man any more, he’s more a midfielder or second striker,’ said the Arsenal boss of his former forward. ‘Because he’s a real team player Marouane, that position suits him very well.

Now  a midfielder, Chamakh has committed more fouls per game than any other Premier League player

Despite selling the striker, Wenger admits he always loved working with Chamakh while he was at Arsenal

‘Look, I loved him always because of his team attitude and he was a hard-working type. But in the end he didn’t play and you have to give the players a chance to go somewhere and play.

‘After, van Persie came back from injury (in 2010) and he was a bit a substitute [and] lost confidence. I’m happy that he went to Crystal Palace and he is making a good career now.’

The Gunners have more than replaced Chamakh, Olivier Giroud offering the hold-up play that the Moroccan was expected to bring, as well as the goals and assists that eluded his predecessor.

But though few Arsenal fans would want him back at the club, they will be aware that on Saturday afternoon, their old player has every chance of causing them problems.
