Says they are worse after spending time with their mother Brooke Mueller

Charlie posted a picture of a birthday cake with a grenade on Twitter as a message to Brooke

Sheen lashed out at Mueller calling her a 'chubby weirdo' after her bid to get a restraining order against him on Monday failed

TMZ have obtained pictures of Bob which allegedly show him sporting a red mark, which Charlie is said to believe is a burn, after a visit to his mother.

However, Brooke insists he had the mark before he arrived at her home

Denise Richards says she can no longer care for Charlie Sheen’s ‘violent’ twins, and has revealed distrubing and distressing details about the troubled boys. 

The 42-year-old actress was granted temporary custody of her ex-husband’s four-year-old sons Bob and Max after their mother, Brooke Mueller was admitted to rehab for the 21st time earlier this year.

However, Denise has written to the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to inform them that she will no longer look after the boys because of their violent outbursts towards her daughters and dogs, according to TMZ.

Violent: While Denise Richards took in Charlie Sheen's sons earlier this year when their mother went to rehab, she says she can no longer care for them after they started attacking her daughters and dogs

Denise reportedly blames Brooke completely for the boys’ behaviour and TMZ reports she revealed they have lashed out at her children, Sam, nine, and Lola, eight, who are Charlie’s daughters and Denise’s adopted child Eloise, two. 

The website says Denise claims ‘her daughters have been strangled, kicked in the head and stomach, scratched, bit, slapped, punched in the face and head, and spit on by Bob and Max’. She also alleges they have thrown their own faeces at her daughters.

After visiting Brooke, Bob is said to have thrown a toy at Sam which left her needing medical attention. 

They are also said to have attacked Denise’s dogs, with TMZ reporting they ‘repeatedly kick her dogs in the head and squeeze their heads with both hands while watching the dogs whimper in pain.

Blame: Denise blames Bob and Max's mother Brooke Mueller (pictured here in 2011) for their violent outbursts and claims the children are traumatised after visiting her

The kids will flip from sweetly petting the dog to strangling the animals and lifting them off the ground by the neck’.

The twins, who Denise says often go into a 'zombie-like state' are said to have told Denise they ‘wanted to hurt and kill the dogs’. 

Their behaviour is not limited to home with Bob in particular, reportedly attacking fellow students and teachers at the school they started in November. 

According to TMZ, Denise attributes the bad behaviour to time spent with Brooke and says the twins suffer terrible nightmares after spending time at her home.

Meanwhile, TMZ have obtained pictures of Bob, which allegedly show him before and after a visit with his mother on July 26.

After the visit, he was reportedly sporting a red mark, which sources tell TMZ Charlie believe was a burn, although Brooke insisted he had it before he arrived at her home.

Denise included the photographic evidence in her letter to DCFS.

Concerned: Charlie is concerned about letting Brooke have access to the twins and has lashed out calling her a 'whore' and a 'chubby weirdo'

Richards claims she has been advised to get counselling for the twins but Brooke has refused to allow it. 

News of Denise’s letter comes just after Charlie, 48, branded Brooke a ‘chubby weirdo’ following her failed attempt to secure a restraining order against him in court on Monday. 

He wrote on Twitter: ‘Oh, by the way, nice try this morning Brooke. ‘you are a chubby weirdo who will lose at every turn trying to get between me and my boys (sic)’

He also posted a bizarre 'birthday' message to her on Tuesday, even though Brooke turned 36 in August.

He captioned a picture of a grenade on top of a cake with the words: 'happy Bday Brooke when you're done sucking off the parking lot at Home Depot why don't ya 'blow' out this candle. c'

Brooke - who left rehab last month - claimed in her petition for the restraining order that her ex-husband has threatened her life and stated she believes he is on a mission to sabotage her sobriety and could even plant drugs on her in his bid to keep her away from their sons.

Uncertain future: It is unclear what exactly will happen to the twins if Denise asks for them to be removed from her home

According to TMZ, the petition claims Charlie said: ‘There will be a reckoning. There will be a whirlwind. That they will all reap while desperate begging for my forgiveness. You've all been warned.

‘I will exercise every resource at my disposal. I will, I will, I will, I will empty my entire war chest and if I can't get it done, I know a guy who can.’

A follow-up hearing has been set for next month.

At the weekend, Denise was reportedly informed by the DCFS that she was not allowed to take the children over to the actor's house for a visit.

A source claimed that officials told the actress that they were annoyed with Charlie after he claimed his sons were in danger and were not being protected by the department after they were allowed an overnight stay with Brooke.

The 48-year-old actor blasted Brooke on Twitter as an ‘evil and pathetic uber loser’ and slammed the DCFS as being ‘inept’.
