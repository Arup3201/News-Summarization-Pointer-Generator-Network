Lionel Messi has guaranteed the Barcelona fans that he will to do 'everything' to help his side beat Atletico Madrid and ensure that they reach the final four of the Copa del Rey.

The two sides meet for the second leg at the Vicente Calderon tonight - a place where the Catalan side have failed to find a victory in their previous three games.

Barcelona saw off Diego Simeone's men 1-0 in the first leg at the Nou Camp, thanks to a late goal from Messi.

'Looking forward to playing in Madrid,' he wrote on his official Facebook page. 'We'll give everything on the pitch to reach the semi-finals.'

Reigning champions Real Madrid were knocked out by rivals Atletico in the previous round, so Luis Enrique and his squad know they have a tough task ahead of them.

Having been beaten by Madrid in last year's final, Barcelona will be hoping they can go one better this time round and lift the Copa del Rey, having failed to win a trophy last season.
