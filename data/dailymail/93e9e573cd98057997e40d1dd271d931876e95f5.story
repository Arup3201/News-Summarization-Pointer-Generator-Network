A photographer sued by a lesbian couple after she refused to take pictures at their commitment ceremony is taking her fight for religious freedom to the Supreme Court.

Elaine Huguenin, who runs a photography business in Albuquerque, New Mexico, refused to take the snaps for the happy day of Vanessa Willock and Misti Collinsworth in 2006.

The women then filed a discrimination lawsuit again Ms Huguenin. New Mexico law prohibits businesses from discriminating against people based on their sexuality.

Elaine Huguenin and her husband Jon, who run a photography business in New Mexico, believe that their right to free speech and religious freedom is being vioalted by forcing them to photograph lesbian and gay weddings

Ms Huguenin and her business Elaine Photography have so far lost the discrimination case in the courts.

However she is now bringing her battle to the Supreme Court, claiming that being forced to photograph the love story of a lesbian couple violates her right to free speech and her deeply-held Christian beliefs.

According to the New York Times, Ms Huguenin is happy to take portraits of gay and lesbian people but not tell the stories of their same-sex weddings - which her religion tells her is wrong.

Ms Willock and Ms Collinsworth filed a 
complaint with the New Mexico Human Rights Commission who ordered the Ms
 Huguenin and her husband Jon to pay $7,000 in damages to the couple.

Ms Huguenine told alliancedefendingfreedom.org: 'If it becomes something where Christians are made to do these things by law in one state, or two, it's going to sweep across the whole United States…and religious freedom could become extinct.'

The case, which has been ongoing since 2006, has become something of a sticking point between conservative Christians and those who defend gay rights. 

Louise Melling, a lawyer at the 
American Civil Liberties Union told the Times that although it was a 
difficult case, the equal treatment of same-sex couples is more 
important than the photographer's business.

Ms Melling said: 'At
 the end of the day, it sells services for photographing weddings. This 
is like putting up a sign that says ''Heterosexual Couples Only.'''

New Mexico is the only state that does not have a law allowing or banning same-sex marriage and does not recognize domestic partnerships.

New Mexico's Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to make same-sex marriage legal but it is unclear when it will rule on the case.
