Spectators at air shows are usually impressed by the boom of fighter jets flying overhead.

But aeroplane fans at the Berlin Air Show were also wowed by the eerily quiet flight of Airbus Group's fully-electric aircraft.

The prototype two-seater made its maiden flight in March but only took to the skies in front of the public last week.

Eerily quiet: The E-Fan prototype electric aircraft, a 31.2-foot (9.5 metres) wingspan plane that Airbus is touting as the precursor to hybrid passenger aircraft, makes a demonstration flight above Merignac airport, France

The E-Fan uses a pair of motors with ducted fans powered by a battery.

The batteries fixed to the wings are the sole power source for the two motors.

An electric motor in the main wheel provides extra power during acceleration and taxiing to prevent a drain of power while the plane is on the ground.

It has a wingspan of 31.2 feet (9.5 metres) and weighs 1,212 pounds (550 kilograms)

It can fly for about half an hour at 110 miles (177 kilometres) per hour.

There is currently a back-up battery for landing and a parachute in case the pilot goes out of range.

Just like on an electric car, a gauge on the dashboard tells the pilot how much energy remains in the batteries before the aircraft has to be recharged.

One of the main landing gear wheels has a small electric motor that can propel the airplane up to 35 miles (55 km) per hour to maximise flight time.

It was designed from scratch, from its electrical propulsion and energy management system to its safety features.

Airbus hopes that the prototype is one step towards the aerospace industry using regional jets powered by hybrid electric engines, which would slash its carbon dioxide emissions.

The
 development of a regional plane, seating between 70 and 90 people that
 can take off and land using electric power, could take between 15 and 20
 years, Airbus Group Chief Technology Officer Jean Botti told reporters 
in Munich.

The company's E-fan aircraft is powered by two electric motors with a combined output of 60 kilowatts.

Airbus 
says it is suited for short missions such as pilot training and 
aerobatics and can currently run on its lithium-ion polymer batteries 
for half an hour, reaching speeds of up to 110 miles (177 kilometres) per hour.

The future today: The E-fan was designed from scratch around its electrical propulsion from its safety features to its energy management system. It is hoped the technology will be used in commercial aircraft in the future to slash carbon  dioxide emissions

Engineers aim to double that fly time, but Mr Botti said: 'They [the batteries] are causing us a lot of headaches.'

He declined to comment on how much the group was investing in hybrid and electric technologies.

The two-seater E-Fan will be built at Bordeaux in southwest France and production could start at the end of 2017.

Mr Botti said he would like to see a prototype for a regional jet in 2030.
