Jill Elizabeth Evans, 54, a former head teacher, allegedly allowed a caretaker to supervise a primary school class while the teacher had a haircut 

A respected primary school head allowed a caretaker to supervise a class while the teacher had a haircut, a disciplinary hearing has been told.

Jill Elizabeth Evans allegedly permitted the professional hairdresser to come to Heolgerrig Primary School in Merthyr Tydfil during school hours to cut staff members' hair.

On one occasion, the school caretaker was left in charge of the class for 20 minutes while the teacher made a trip to the makeshift salon.  

Mrs Evans, a teacher for more than 20 years, also allegedly encouraged pupils to disrupt supply teachers' lessons and employed her future daughter-in-law in a role that had not been advertised, the hearing heard.

The 54-year-old is also accused of bullying eight members of staff and flouting health and safety rules, which are said to have put pupils at risk. 

Mrs Evans denies all nine charges of 'unacceptable behaviour', which relate to her time as head teacher between 2007 and 2010.  

Yvonne Mahoney, who worked as a Learning Support Assistant (LSA) at Heolgerrig during the period of the alleged misconduct, told the hearing: 'Haircuts always extended into classroom time.

'Classes were left unsupervised from qualified staff.' 

Presenting the allegations, Martin Jones told the General Teaching Council that another charge related to Mrs Evans allegedly allowing children to play football around building work.

She is also alleged to have misused around £1,500 of grant funding that had been attained to pay for a 'Success Maker' education package, which would buy support software for staff.   

But, in his opening remarks, Gwilym Roberts-Harry, who represents Mrs Evans, said that all witnesses in the case 'had a grudge to bear' against his client.

He said that 'ulterior motives were going on' against Mrs Evans, who he said had been recognised in a number of Estyn and HMI school inspections.

Mrs Mahoney told the hearing how Mrs Evans 'wanted to control everyone and everything' and would often take away a teacher's preparation, planning and assessment entitlement, time used for members of staff to catch up with marking and lesson planning.

Mrs Mahoney said: 'If she (Evans) had an issue with a member of staff she, would change their PPA timetable to cause a nuisance for them. She told me that.'

She also alleged that Mrs Evans would encourage pupils to 'play-up' and be disruptive in front of supply teachers they did not like.

'This was a common theme for Jill,' Mrs Mahoney said. 'She would encourage this disrespect for supply teachers, to see how the supply teachers would handle it.'

Mrs Mahoney was asked whether she knew that a classroom assistant appointed in 2009 was in a relationship with Mrs Evans' son - a fact Mrs Evans claims to have been unaware of.

Mrs Mahoney said: 'They were definitely in a relationship, and got engaged either just before or just after she started at the school. Jill told me herself.'

She said that the role had not been advertised. 

The hearing in Cardiff continues.
