A kidnap gang who tortured a sauna boss after abducting him off the street has been jailed for more than 66 years.

The criminals demanded £400,000 from Stefanos Neophytou after they took him to a house where they  threatened his family and said they would pour petrol and acid over him.

The businessman, who was beaten and bound in chains, was only freed after promising to find £50,000 to pay off the gang who had warned they would 'do him in'.

Masterminds: The operation was lead by Mahmoud Abouakkour (left), 21, and 32-year-old Tobias Uter (right)

But he reported the incident to the police and detectives arrested two of the gang members when they arrived at a drop-off point to collect the money.

Six gang members were jailed yesterday for more than 66 years after a month-long trial.

The operation was lead by  Mahmoud Abouakkour, 21, and 32-year-old Tobias Uter, Birmingham Crown Court heard.

Judge Roderick Henderson said the blackmail plot had been carried out by 'ruthless and determined people' and that 'significant planning and professionalism was involved.' 

He described the victim as an 'impressive and strong minded man' who ran the kind of business which 'attracted the attention of professional criminals.'

He said: 'They demanded money from him, £400,000, which demonstrates the stakes for which these people were playing'.

The kidnapping took place on January 3 this year as Mr Neophytou was leaving the Libra Sauna Club near Hockley, Birmingham, and walking to his car, said prosecutor Michael Burrows QC.

He was confronted by a hooded man and bundled into the back of a van, where a blanket was put over his head and his wrists tied.

He was dragged out of the van into a house where a chain was put around his neck which was held so tight that he thought he was going to pass out, the court heard.

He was forced upstairs and told to wait for the 'Big Man' who later arrived and told Mr Neophytou he knew everything about him and his family - before demanding £400,000 'tax' for protection.

The Birmingham businessman stripped when he said he did not have the cash.

Mr Burrows added: 'They said they had acid and petrol. He was aware of them putting some kind of bucket or barrel next to him and heard them ripping paper.'

The victim was released when he eventually agreed to pay the thugs £50,000. He was put back into the van and dropped off in Ward End, Birmingham, in the early hours of the morning.  

He later told the gang he only had £20,000, which he said he would leave in a waste bin on January 7. Police arrested Abouakkour and Uter when they went to pick up the money.

Abouakkour, of Birmingham, was found guilty of conspiracy to kidnap and blackmail and two charges of attempted intimidation and was jailed for 20 years.

Uter, of Birmingham, had previously admitted conspiracy to kidnap and blackmail and was found guilty of two charges of attempted intimidation. He was jailed for 18 years and six months.

Karl Williams, 36, of no fixed address, was convicted of attempted intimidation, possessing a firearm with intent and when prohibited and was jailed for 13 years.

Daniel Roberts, 40, of Gloucester, who had also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to kidnap and blackmail, was handed a sentence of nine years and 10 months.

Laura Lamb, 22, of Birmingham, was jailed for five years, after being found guilty of attempted intimidation and possessing a firearm with intent.

Daniel Wood, 23, of Birmingham, who had admitted money laundering, was sentenced to six months.

Detective inspector Tom Chisholm led the investigation to bring the gang to justice.

He said: 'The defendants in this investigation were an organised and determined group, who went to considerable lengths to kidnap and blackmail the victim.

'We are committed to reducing serious and organised crime in the West Midlands and we are satisfied with the sentences handed to them, which reflect the grave nature of their offences.

'We also hope it shows that crime really does not pay and deters others from getting involved in such crimes.'
