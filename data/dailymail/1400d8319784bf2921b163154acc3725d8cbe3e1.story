A signed copy of a book by assassinated US president John F Kennedy, said to be intended as a gift to the Queen, is to go under the hammer.

The copy of Why England Slept, by John F Kennedy, which bears the dedication: 'To Elizabeth (II) with affection John F Kennedy' and the quote 'we must not fear to negotiate', is being sold online on auction site Picollecta.com.

Kennedy was president of the United States from 1961 until he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963 - nearly exactly 50 years ago.

Why England Slept, about the events leading up to the Second World War, was written by JFK during his senior year at Harvard University.

Published in 1940, it was re-published during his term as president and the signed copy was published in 1962.

The inside page bears a dedication in blue ink which reads: 'To Elizabeth (II) with affection John F Kennedy' and then in brackets, 'we must not fear to negotiate!', while the front cover has the words 'is still sleeping' written in pencil.

Old acquaintances: Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh entertained President Kennedy and wife Jackie at a dinner at Buckingham palace in 1961

It is said to have been intended as a gift to the Queen when Kennedy visited England for crucial Cold War talks with Harold Macmillan in Sussex in June 1963, but she was in Scotland at the time so could not receive it.

The words 'we must not fear to negotiate' are a variation of words used by Kennedy in his inaugural address when he said: 'let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate'.

A Picollecta.com spokesman said the book has a letter of provenance from its seller explaining that he bought it from an antiquarian and rare book dealer in Stamford, Lincolnshire in April 2001.

But he added: 'There is no record of how it ended up in Lincolnshire.'

The book is expected to raise several hundreds of pounds, with the auction ending on December 12.
