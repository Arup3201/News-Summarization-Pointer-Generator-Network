Bryan Redpath has left his coaching role at Sale Sharks with immediate effect.

The 43-year-old Scot ends an eight-year association with the Aviva Premiership side, having spent five years with them as a player and three as a coach.

Redpath returned to Sale in June 2012 as director of rugby after starting a coaching career at Gloucester and progressing to the top job at Kingsholm.

Bryan Redpath has thanked Sale Sharks' owners, coaches and players after leaving Sale Sharks 

Redpath spent five years with Sale as a player and a further three as a coach 

But with Sale struggling four months into Redpath's tenure, he was removed from the director of rugby role at the Salford-based side and has since been operating as head coach.

'I would like to thank the owners, coaches, players and staff for all their help and support since I returned to the club in 2012. Also to the supporters who have been great with me both as a player and as a coach,' Redpath said.
