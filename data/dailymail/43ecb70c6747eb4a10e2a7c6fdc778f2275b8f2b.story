Dead: Monica Shay died in hospital after being shot in her childhood home, which she used as a weekend retreat

A New York professor has died three days after she and four others were hit in a bloodbath shooting at her Pennsylvania weekend home.

Monica Shay, 58, a professor at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn died yesterday after being injured when gunman Mark Geisenheyner went on the rampage on Sunday.

The arts and culture professor lived in New York but kept her childhood home in Douglass Township as a weekend retreat.

She and her husband Paul Shay were targeted by the man as he sought revenge after being imprisoned for an insurance scam he had allegedly carried out with Mr Shay.

Mrs Shay's brother, Edward Newbold, 
told ABC6: 'She was beautiful, loved. She was a wonderful beautiful 
person. I miss her so much.'

Prosecutors revealed that the mother of a two-year-old boy shot in cold blood by a career criminal
made a haunting 911 call begging police to 'help my baby'.

Terrified and covered in blood after being shot herself, Kathryn Erdmann made the 
call after watching helplessly as Geisenheyner, 51, put a handgun to the 
back of her little boy's head and pulled the trigger.

The horrific details emerged as prosecutors revealed Geisenheyner was a 
career criminal who carried out the holiday massacre as revenge for an 
insurance scam that landed him in jail.

He was killed by SWAT teams after shooting dead two-year-old Gregory 
Erdmann and his stepfather, and critically wounding three others.

Police said he had planned the 
murder of Paul Shay, the owner of the rural home in Douglass Township, 
Pennsylvania, for more than a year after he was imprisoned for an 
insurance scam the two had allegedly carried out.

According to prosecutors, Geisenheyner had no idea there would be five people in the house when he walked in brandishing a handgun on Saturday night - but he had no compunction in shooting everybody in the property, including little Gregory.

The boy's mother, 37-year-old Miss Erdmann, had been excited about her planned July 4th weekend with her boyfriend, Joseph Shay, to meet his aunt and uncle, Paul and Monica Shay.

She is now fighting for her life in hospital along with 64-year-old Paul Shay, who owns a plumbing business in New York.

Miss Erdmann's boyfriend, 43-year-old Joseph Shay, died at the scene.

After watching helplessly as her son was shot, Miss Erdmann rang police and desperately told the 
operator: 'I don't know where I am. Please help my baby.'

Montgomery County prosecutors described how Geisenheyner burst into the
Shays' rural holiday home with a .22-calibre gun and announced: 'Guess 
you never thought you’d see me again'.

Kevin
Steele, the county's assistant district attorney, said: 'I don't think 
Geisenheyner expected anyone else to be there. But that didn't stop him 
from assassinating a toddler.'

He said Miss Erdmann and her son were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, and Paul Shay was the intended target.

Geisenheyner
had told friends he had been cut out of the profits for an insurance 
scam he and Mr Shay had allegedly plotted, according to prosecutors, and
for which he had been jailed.

The
two had allegedly arranged for Geisenheyner to steal a painting from Mr
Shay's East Village home in New York, prosecutors said. But 
Geisenheyner was arrested for theft and sent back to prison for 
violating the terms of his parole.

Montgomery
County district attorney Risa Ferman said: 'When Geisenheyner got out 
of prison, he was determined to exact revenge on Paul Shay.'

Tense stand-off: Police outside the house in Trainer, Pennsylvania, where Mark Geisenheyner was killed by SWAT officers following a shooting at a home in Douglass Township which left two dead and three injured

Confession: Prosecutors say Geisenheyner admitted to shooting the five. He was killed after a six-hour stand-off yesterday

After
the shooting Geisenheyner, who has a criminal record stretching back to
the 1970s, fled to the home of a man he had got to know in prison, in 
Trainer, Pennsylvania.

He arrived in the early hours of Monday morning, and confessed to the horrified man that he had just shot five people.

He
let Geisenheyner into the house, and then waited until he had fallen 
asleep to run out and call police. He told his landlord he prayed he 
wouldn't be murdered.

When Geisenheyner woke up later that morning, 125 SWAT officers had surrounded the home.

In
a tense six-hour stand-off, in which teams fired tear gas and 
percussion bombs into the house, Geisenheyner admitted what he had done,
and told police he had no intention of going back to prison.

After
multiple attempts to make him come out, officers stormed the house at 
around 11.45am. They found Geisenheyner in the basement, and shot him 
when they saw he was armed with a .45-calibre handgun.

Grieving friends of Kathryn Erdmann near her home in Fall River, 
Massachusetts, described how excited she'd been about her trip to 
Pennsylvania.

They said 
Miss Erdmann called Gregory her 'miracle baby' because she had had him 
when she was in her 30s. Today neighbours built a shrine for the little 
boy outside his house, with candles, photos and messages.

Mr and Mrs Shay lived in New York City 
but kept Mrs Shay's childhood home in Douglass Township as a weekend retreat, and had spent 
years renovating the property.

It emerged their nephew, Joseph, had spent time in jail for drug dealing and grand larceny.

Friends told the Philadelphia 
Inquirer Mr Shay had given his nephew a job when he was released from prison last year.

Joseph had been staying with the couple and was said to be turning his life around.

Dan Hoyt, a neighbour of the Shays in Manhattan, told the New York Post: 'It's bizarre, a shock - and a whole family.

'He
(Joseph Shay) was just coming out of jail, and Paul took him in. He 
gave him a place to work at his company, a Real Good Plumber.

'Paul was the kind of guy who hired people most wouldn't. He liked to help people out and get them on their feet.

'His nephew was in and out of trouble with police, and Paul was helping him out.'
