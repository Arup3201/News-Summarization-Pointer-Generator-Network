Celtic have drawn FC Salzburg, GNK Dinamo and FC Astra in Group D of the Europa League after crashing out of the Champions League to Slovenian side NK Maribor on Tuesday. 

The Hoops have never faced any of their Group D opponents.

The Scottish Premiership champions will face their Group D opponents home and away on 18 September, 2 and 23 October, 6 and 27 November, and 11 December.  

Celtic manager Ronny Deila has said that a good run in the Europa League would stand his side in good stead for future Champions League campaigns.

Deila will hope that his side can get through Group D and reach the final at the National Stadium in Warsaw on May 27 2015.
