Phil Robertson, the star of A&E's hit reality show Duck Dynasty, has addressed his controversial comments about homosexuals, comparing his attitude towards gays to that of Jesus Christ himself.

The 68-year-old patriarch of Louisiana’s Robertson clan sat down with ABC News this week to promote his new autobiography, UnPHILtered: The Way I See It, and discuss a series of incendiary remarks he has made concerning homosexuals, African-Americans and Nazis.

Speaking with ABC’s Ryan Owens, Robertson reiterated: 'People need to get it in their head, dude, I don’t hate anybody.'

What would Jesus do: Phil Robertson, the outspoken star of Duck Dynasty, comapred himself to the Son of God regarding his attitude towards homosexuals

Speaking out: Robertson agreed to be interviewed by ABC's Ryan Owens (left) to promote his new autobiography 

The camo-wearing, bearded reality star who made a fortune manufacturing and selling duck calls under the brand Duck Commander was briefly suspended by A&E last December for calling homosexuality a sin and comparing it to bestiality in a GQ interview.

Robertson also went on record as saying that growing up in Louisiana in the 1960s, he never witnessed a black person being mistreated by whites, and that Nazis needed Jesus.

Amid a firestorm sparked by his incendiary remarks, Mr Robertson remained defiant, saying that he was merely quoting from the Bible.

‘I just said, “Whether it be bestiality.” I could've said pedophilia, rape, homosexual sin, heterosexual sin,’ Robertson said. ‘To me, I was just letting them know they're all the same. Just sin.’

In response to a question about Robertson's reputation as a homophobe, the 68-year-old compared himself to the Son of God.

'I'm as much of a homophobe as Jesus was,' the deeply devout Mr Robertson stated.

'The people who are participating in homosexual behavior, they need to know that I love them.'

Tell-all book: Robertson penned his new memoir UnPHILtered in part to address the controversy sparked by his incendiary comments last year 

Slap on the wrist: Robertson, 68, was temporarily suspended from Duck Dynasty in December 2013 after comparing homosexuality to bestiality in a GQ interview

He also took the opportunity to address his earlier remarks about African-Americans in the segregated South, insisting that he does not see race and considers all people, black or white, the same.

Robertson, who struggled with alcohol in his youth, has credited his conversion to Christianity at age 28 with setting him on the right path in life.

He earned a master’s degree in education from Louisiana Tech University, where he also played football.

‘I'm a highly-educated man, maybe a shocker to some,’ Robertson said. ‘I'm no dumbo.’

Robertson was later invited to play football professionally with the Washington Redskins, but famously turned down the offer because it interfered with duck hunting season.

In 1966, he married Marsha Kay, better known to Duck Dynasty fans as Miss Kay, and the couple had four children together, two of whom also starred on the A&E reality show.

The 68-year-old patriarch and businessman used the ABC interview to send a message to his critics who have been excoriating him online for his remarks about race and sexual orientation.

‘I don't own a cell phone. I've never turned on a computer in my life,’ he said.

‘So whatever America is saying or not saying about me, true or untrue, what they need to understand is I'm not hearing it.’

UnPHILtered, released by Howard Books Tuesday, is a follow-up to Robertson’s 2013 autobiography Happy, Happy, Happy. He also co-authored the book Everything’s Better With a Beard with his quirky brother, Si, and two of his sons, Willie and Jase.
