Two mothers brought terror to the playground of a primary school when they became involved in a brawl with another woman in front of children.

Victim Elizabeth Smart had just dropped her kids off at school when she became involved in a foul-mouthed row with a relative of Sharon Nyberg, 43.

Ms Smart was offered refuge in the school, but when she left Nyberg was waiting for her outside the school gates.

A court heard Nyberg barged another parent holding a toddler out of the way then launched a ferocious attack on Ms Smart.

As
terrified children looked on, Ms Smart was put to the ground, had 
clumps of hair pulled out, was scratched, hit and was left bleeding so 
heavily an ambulance had to be called.

During
the attack at St Michael's Church of England First School, in Alnwick, 
another parent, Jolene Angus, 26, also joined in with the attack.

After
the incident, Angus and Carlene Balmbra, 28, set up fake Facebook 
accounts in the names of two witnesses in an effort to scupper the case.

They printed off made-up 
conversations between the women which appeared to undermine the case and
sent them to the Crown Prosecution Service and the school.

But
their lies were exposed, and now Nyberg and Angus have admitted affray 
and Angus and Carlene Balmbra admitted attempting to pervert the course 
of justice.

The court heard the incident outside the school happened on June 27, 2011.

John Cleasby, prosecuting, said: "This was in broad daylight outside a school with small children in the vicinity.

'It was witnessed by a number of teaching assistants, who were sent out in order to bring the violence to a conclusion.

'In due course the assault stopped and Nyberg and Angus readjusted their hair and left the scene calmly.'

Ms Smart had become involved in an angry exchange with a member of Nyberg's family and feelings were running high.

The
school secretary came out and offered Ms Smart refuge .Mr Cleasby said:
'She thought she would be fine going home with friends and had been 
offered a lift.

'While exiting the school premises she became aware that Sharon Nyberg had waited for her.

'She came directly at her and it was clear she was intent on violence from the outset.

'She barged one lady out of the way who had a two-year-old child in her hands.'

Nyberg, of Howling Lane, Alnwick, admitted affray and was given a 12 month community order with 60 hours of unpaid work.

Angus,
of Windsor Gardens, Alnwick, pleaded guilty to affray and perverting 
the course of justice and was given six months prison suspended for 12 
months with 100 hours of unpaid work.

Mother-of-three
Balmbra, also of Windsor Gardens, Alnwick, admitted perverting the 
course of justice and was given a 12-month community order.
