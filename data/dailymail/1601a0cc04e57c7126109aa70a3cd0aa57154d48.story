A US couple says they were escorted off a plane and met by police inside the terminal after their young son broke into tantrums and they argued with flight attendants over his seat.

Father Leo Khalfin said the conflict began when he placed his crying son, Sam, in his lap just before take-off on a Frontier Airlines flight from Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, to St Louis. Missouri.

A flight attendant told the couple, from Chesterfield, Missouri, that their two-year-old had to be buckled in his own seat, based on company policy, even though he sat in his father’s lap during take-off on the way to the Caribbean nation.

Like most airlines, Frontier’s policy allows children from seven days old to two years old to travel on the lap of an adult.

Mr Khalfin said he complied with the request: ‘I put him in the seat. I buckled him in and he was of course screaming and yelling and you know, I held him with force.’

But the flight attendant returned and threatened to kick the family off the plane as his son, who was on his first holiday abroad, continued to cry, he claimed.

He told NBC affiliate KSDK: ‘She said, well your son is too loud, you know, if you're not going to keep him calm in the next three minutes, you guys are going to have to leave the plane.’

His son calmed down but had another outburst during turbulence, leading to more tension between the couple and cabin crew.

The Khalfins say a flight attendant threatened to kick them off the flight if their son didn't stop crying

When the plane landed in St Louis the family was escorted off the plane and met by police 'like criminals', said Mr Khalfin.

But a Frontier Airlines spokesman told KSDK that police were requested because the Khalfins were verbally and physically abusive to the flight staff.

He claimed Sam’s mother, Regina, threw rubbish at a flight attendant and tried to incite the people around her, and that the couple refused to follow instructions to use a seat belt on their son.

The Khalfins have filed complaints with Frontier Airlines and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office

Mrs Khalfin denied the airline's claim and said she was just gathering names and numbers of other passengers who could act as witnesses.

The couple has filed complaints with Frontier Airlines and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office, KSDK reported.

The child seating policy used by Frontier Airlines is applied by many other carriers.

British Airways, for example, allows children under two years to sit in an adult’s lap using an extension seat belt.
