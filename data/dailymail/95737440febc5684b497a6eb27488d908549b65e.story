Alberto Contador on Sunday won the Vuelta a Espana for a third time.

The 31-year-old Spaniard, who rides for Tinkoff-Saxo, claimed the red jersey he also won in 2008 and 2012 ahead of Team Sky's Chris Froome, with Spain's Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) third.

The stage 21 9.7-kilometre time-trial - completing the three-week, 3,239.9km race - in Santiago de Compostela was won by Spain's Adriano Malori (Movistar) in 11 minutes 12 seconds.

The Vuelta was the race everyone in cycling had predicted the 2014 Tour de France would be, full of excitement with the main protagonists duelling for victory.

Vincenzo Nibali won the Tour after Froome (wrist/hand) and Contador (leg) suffered race-ending fractures.

Both showed remarkable powers of recovery to contest for the red jersey, which Contador took after the 10th stage time-trial to Borja.

Contador won Saturday's 20th stage in Puerto de Ancares, his second stage success of the race, ahead of Froome to all-but confirm a sixth Grand Tour victory, barring sporting catastrophe on the short, final race against the clock.

In the end it was a victory procession for Contador, who has two Tour de France titles and one Giro d'Italia crown and won by one minute 11 seconds.

Contador clocked 12mins 52secs, with Froome 26secs quicker.

The stage was described as El Final del Camino (the End of the Road) and for Briton David Millar (Garmin-Sharp) it was particularly poignant.

The 37-year-old Scot is to retire at the end of this season and the Vuelta was his last major race.

Millar, a drug cheat turned anti-doping campaigner and winner of stages in all three Grand Tours, was 97th on the stage.
