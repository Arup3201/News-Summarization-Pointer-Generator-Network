Ring leader: Admitted Russian mobster and former South Beach club owner Alec Simchuk, 46, has opened up to authorities after his arrest on fraud and bribery charges

A Russian mobster was sentenced Friday to three years in federal prison after admitting he ran a South Beach scam that used so-called 'B-Girls' to lure wealthy tourists into secret bars where they were charged exorbitant amounts on credit cards for alcohol.

Alec Simchuk, 46, hobbled into the Miami federal courtroom on a crutch because Russian thugs broke one of his legs in a vain effort to prevent him from returning to the U.S. to plead guilty and testify against his cohorts, most of whom were convicted after an 11-week trial.

Federal prosecutors sought a light sentence because Simchuk returned voluntarily from Russia despite the assault and threats against both his life and that of his wife. U.S. District Judge Robert Scola agreed, even shaving four months off the prosecutor's recommended prison term.

'I think he should be given credit for coming here and facing the music,' the judge said.

Simchuk testified that he imported his scam from Riga, Latvia, to Miami Beach in 2009. With him came a few dozen attractive Russian and Eastern European women who worked as 'B-Girls,' which is short for 'Bar Girls.'

The scantily-clad women trolled swanky South Beach bars looking for rich men – they were instructed to focus on expensive shoes and watches – and invited them back to private clubs operated by Simchuk's gang.

Baited: Simchuk has admitted to flying women from Russia and the Baltic States into the U.S. to manipulate men at his private South Beach clubs, including pictured Anna Kilimatova, 25, of Latvia

Speaking out: Testifying against Simchuk and his illegal operations has been 24-year-old 'B-girl' Marina Turcina of Latvia, pictured, who previously pleaded guilty to her involvement

The clubs had cool-sounding names like Caviar Bar and Stars Lounge but were not open to the public.

Once there, the women made sure the 
men got exceedingly drunk and then ran up huge alcohol charges on their 
credit cards. The clubs even had vases where the women would pour out 
drinks so the men would have to order more.

One victim, former Philadelphia TV 
weatherman John Bolaris, testified that he was charged some $43,000 over
two nights through the scheme. In all, dozens of men were fraudulently 
charged between $400,000 and $1 million, according to court records. The
total is still being calculated.

Simchuk initially fled to Russia – 
which has no extradition treaty with the U.S. – just before he and 18 
others were indicted by a federal grand jury in 2011.

A year later, he agreed to surrender 
and cooperate even though his leg had been broken by mobsters after 
Simchuk received a threatening phone call from Albert Takhalov, 31, who 
was convicted in the recent U.S. trial.

Big spenders: Valeria Matsova, 22, pictured of 
Estonia, is also one of the named 'B-girls' who helped lure 
at least 88 men in all to the private clubs and purposely racking up 
thousands of dollars worth of bar tabs

Prize: The women, two pictured from left Kristina Takhalov, 29, of Miami Beach and Agnese Rudaka, 22, of Latvia, were promised a 20 per cent commission off of the men's bar tabs

Simchuk pleaded guilty to charges of 
wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud the U.S., which could have landed 
him in prison for a much longer term. In court Friday, Simchuk said he 
was sorry and pleaded for another chance to live an honest life.

His attorney, Michael B. Cohen, said 
Simchuk's cooperation was key to the convictions of Takhalov and two 
other men in December. They each face more than 20 years in prison when 
they are sentenced later this year.

'He did his job. He did what he was supposed to do,' Cohen said.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Thakur
said Simchuk initially lied about how he broke his leg, telling 
investigators he slipped on ice. But Cohen said that was only to protect
his wife, who was still in Russia at the time.

In all, 12 of those charged in the scheme pleaded guilty, including most of the 'B-Girls' who have subsequently been deported. 

Three men were convicted in last 
year's trial. One suspect remains a fugitive, and another is scheduled 
for trial in the coming months.
