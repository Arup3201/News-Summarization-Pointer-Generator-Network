Jonathan De Guzman has admitted Holland have unfinished business when they meet Spain in their World Cup opener.

The two sides clashed in the World Cup final four years ago, with Andres Iniesta's strike enough to see the Spaniards edge out Holland in extra time.

The midfielder who has been on loan at Swansea from Villarreal since 2012, didn't feature in the bad-tempered South Africa showdown, but having been named in Louis Van Gaal's World Cup squad admits his team-mates still hurting from the final loss.

‘We have a little bit of revenge to take care of,’ De Guzman told the Sunday Mirror. ‘Winning that first game would send a big message. It would be big not just for the team or squad, but for the whole World Cup.

‘It would be great for us if we can do that and get a result against the defending champions.’

The duo will meet for the first time since the previous tournament's final when they face off at Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador on June 13 in Group B's opening game.

Both sides are expected to fight for top spot to progress to the last 16, with Australia and Chile making up the other teams in their World Cup group.
