It was like a scene out of Top Gun.

The moment plane spotters got more than they bargained for when a low-flying fighter jet missed their heads by a few feet has been caught on video.

Spectators
 at the RAF Waddington Airshow on Saturday in Lincolnshire had their 
cameras at the ready when the F16 came into land following a display.

However, the Turkish air force jet came in to land lower than anticipated - sending the crowds running for cover.

Standing on and around a fence at the edge of a road, people throw themselves to the ground as the jet soars past, landing on a nearby runway.

However, in the dramatic footage, many can be seen holding cameras and mobile phones in a bid to capture footage of the jet as it thunders above their heads.

One man says: 'That was a bit close, wasn't it' as the roar of the aircraft can be heard.

Coming into land! The fighter jet can be seen just feet above the heads of spectators at the Waddington Airshow
