The American phenomenon of throwing proms for teen school leavers is now commonplace in the UK. But it's no longer just those moving on from sixth form getting the red carpet treatment.

British children as young as four are now having proms of their own to mark the auspicious occasion of leaving their nursery to go to 'big' school.

The occasion involves little girls dressing up in ball gowns complete with corsages while the boys wear black tie or tuxedos and some are even transported to the event in limos.

High Street store Debenhams have capitialised on the demand with a range of prom dresses for four-year-olds.

Their March/April magazine showcases some of the garments that will be in store with dresses for 'little ladies' - including those by designers Jenny Packham and John Rocha - and suits for 'miniature gents'.

Busy Bees nursery in Lemington Spa is one of the nurseries up and down the country who have thrown a prom for toddlers.

On their website, accompanied by a picture of children dressed up in suits and party dresses, they write: 'This year we celebrated in style with a fire engine limo! The children were able to take part in using the real fire hoses to spray water. Mr Mayhem once again joined us with his fun disco and party games.'

But while some nurseries may see the prom as an innocent pastime creating an opportunity for children to dress up like princesses and princes and have a party, some parents and experts are alarmed by the idea.

Lisa Eliot, author of Pink Brain, Blue Brain, told The Times she concerned by the way proms reinforce gender stereotypes at such a young age.

She said: 'Dressing like a prom queen is not a healthy pastime for young children, in my opinion... by making kids dress according to the extreme of gender apparel, we are telling them that whether they are a boy or girl is their most important feature.'

Meanwhile, Sue Palmer, a former head teacher and author of 21st Century Girls, told the newspaper she 'takes issue' with the nursery proms because she 'believes children should be making mud pies and not squeezing into sequins until at least puberty.'

Many parents will agree with her point that a prom where toddlers pull up in a limo dressed to the nines to be greeted by photographers is too much, too young.

And it's not just the emotional cost that may concern them but the financial cost too.

A prom dress from Debenhams' children's range starts at £45. But competitive mothers may decide to forgo the High Street for designers pushing the price into the hundreds. Then there's the additional costs of shoes, handbags, transport and photographers.

Another concern for parents is if they set the bar high for their child's nursery prom, they will have to continue paying out as their child then attends a primary then secondary school prom.

Julie Tinson, who carried out research on proms at the University of Stirling, found that 90 per cent of secondary schools in Scotland have a prom now in favour of a school disco with parents spending £400 on average.

'As a ritual in itself, it's not too concerning, but it's more about excess of consumption. If we're doing this at nursery, the expected spend accelerates considerably as the child gets older. What are they going to expect by the time they are at secondary?' she said in The Times.

It seems Debenhams already have the answer to her question. In 2011 'prom season' they saw a 57 per cent rise in sales of occasion handbags and a 1,322 per cent sales increase on false lashes.

Debenhams spokesperson Carie Barkhuizen said: 'Dancing at the school disco seems to have had its day. All the focus is now on the prom and being the bell of the ball.'

As a result the British brand has also seen an increase in demand from under 18s for their personal shopping service where an expert advises them on style and accessorising. Whether this service will soon be in demand from four-year-olds remains to be seen.
