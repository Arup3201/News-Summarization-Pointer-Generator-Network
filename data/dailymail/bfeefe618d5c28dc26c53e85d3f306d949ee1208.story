CLICK HERE to find out why Atletico Madrid had to wait 105 days to get the trophy.

Atletico Madrid were finally presented with the La Liga trophy some 105 days after winning it as they snatched their first victory of the season over newly-promoted Eibar at the Vicente Calderon.

The reigning champions - minus suspended manager Diego Simeone, who is serving an eight-match touchline ban - received the  trophy before the game, which narrowly ended 2-1 in the home side's favour.

It took Atletico just 11 minutes to pounce through Miranda before new-signing Mario Mandzukic doubled their lead in the 25th minute, only for a stubborn Eibar to bridge the gap soon after.

Goals: Abraham (33)

It was Abraham's stunning goal in the 33rd minute which made the La Liga new-boys believe they could compete, and the modest Basque side kept Atletico fans on edge in the second half.

Atletico - without departed striker Diego Costa, who joined Chelsea during the summer - failed to deliver the same intensity and conviction that powered them to last season's title on Saturday.

Assistant manager German Burgos directed Atletico from the dugout, while Simeone watched from the stands as punishment for vehemently protesting during the Spanish Super Cup earlier in the month. 

Miranda and former Bayern Munich striker Mandzukic's headers were somewhat routine, but Abraham's strike to reduce the deficit was anything but.

A beautifully-curled shot into the top-right corner rounded off a succession of one-touch football and a cheeky back-heeled flick from the new kids on the La Liga block, and drew warm applause from the 48,000 in the Vicente Calderon.

Eibar took control of possession in the second half, forcing Atletico to sit deep. 

The visitors almost snatched an equaliser when Eneko Boveda's header skimmed the post 15 minutes from time, but it wasn't to be.

Simeone's men survived to record their first win of the new season, having been held to a 0-0 draw against Rayo Vallecano five days earlier.
