A snack foods company plans to up the ante on their advertising techniques similar to the Hollywood movie Minority Report and 'watch' every customer who shops for their delicious treats.

Mondelez International, whose portfolio includes the likes of Chips Ahoy, Nabisco, Oreo, Trident, Toblerone, Halls, Ritz and other high-profile snacks, says it plans to debut a grocery shelf in 2015, which comes equipped with sensors to determine the age and sex of passing customers.

The shelf is hooked up to Microsoft’s Kinect controller, which is a motion sensing input device.

Big Brother: New smart shelves will be able to scan basic facial features like bone structure when people walk by to build a profile of a potential snacker

Snack foods powerhouse: Mondelez International plans to target advertisements at its customers through shelving sensors that determine the age and sex of shoppers

It will be able to scan basic facial features like bone structure to build a profile of a potential snacker, Mondelez chief information officer Mark Dajani told the Wall Street Journal.

Pictures of people’s faces will not be stored however the scanner will aggregate demographic data from the thousands of people who shop in these stores.

The information will help the company build a more accurate understanding of what their consumers like to buy and thereby help funnel more of the desired products to the right shoppers.

Minority Report: The new snack technology is similar to this movie in which Tom Cruise is bombarded by 'personalised advertising' that reads his state of mind

Real time advertising: The technology will help to convince people who are undecided about what to buy through well-timed in-store commercials

It is also hoped the new technology will help to convince people who are undecided about what to buy to make an impulse buy by offering well-timed in-store commercials or coupons when the embedded weight sensor learns they have picked up an item, according to The Washington Post.

It is something quite similar to the Hollywood film Minority Report, where Tom Cruise is bombarded from all sides with advertising that is based on his state of mind.

The snacks company might not quite be there yet, but technology is certainly moving in that direction.

The technology will also have well-timed ads in the shop to target specific customers based on weight sensors that show when an item is picked up

It is reminiscent of a scene from Minority Report with Tom Cruise where he is bombarded by ads from all sides that can read his state of mind
