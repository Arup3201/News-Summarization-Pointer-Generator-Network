The mother of Brittany Maynard has hit back at the Vatican's criticism of her daughter's decision to end her life early rather than suffer with terminal brain cancer. 

Just days after Maynard's  death last month, the Vatican's top bioethics official called her choice 'reprehensible' and said physician-assisted suicide should be condemned and said it was 'reprehensible.'

But now Maynard's mother, Debbie Ziegler, issued a sharp written response Tuesday, saying the Vatican official's comments came as the family was grieving and were 'more than a slap in the face.'

Her response was made through Compassion & Choices, an advocacy group that Maynard worked with.

She also cricitizes the choice of words used to describe her daughter in the statement: 'My twenty-nine-year-old daughter's choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation.

'Reprehensible is a harsh word. It means: 'very bad; deserving very strong criticism.' Reprehensible is a word I've used as a teacher to describe the actions of Hitler, other political tyrants and the exploitation of children by pedophiles. '

I am Brittany Maynard's mother. I am writing in response to a variety of comments made in the press and online by individuals and institutions that have tried to impose their personal belief system on what Brittany and our family feel is a human rights issue.

The imposition of 'belief' on a human rights issue is wrong. To censure a personal choice as reprehensible because it does not comply with someone else's belief is immoral. 

My twenty-nine-year-old daughter's choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation.

Reprehensible is a harsh word. It means: 'very bad; deserving very strong criticism.' Reprehensible is a word I've used as a teacher to describe the actions of Hitler, other political tyrants and the exploitation of children by pedophiles. 

As Brittany Maynard's mother, I find it difficult to believe that anyone who knew her would ever select this word to describe her actions. Brittany was a giver. She was a volunteer. She was a teacher. She was an advocate. She worked at making the world a better place to live.

This word was used publicly at a time when my family was tender and freshly wounded. Grieving. Such strong public criticism from people we do not know, have never met – is more than a slap in the face. It is like kicking us as we struggle to draw a breath.

People and institutions that feel they have the right to judge Brittany's choices may wound me and cause me unspeakable pain but they do not deter me from supporting my daughter's choice. 

There is currently a great deal of confusion and arrogance standing in the way of Americans going gently into the good night. I urge Americans to think for themselves. Make your wishes clear while you are competent. 

Make sure that you have all the options spelled out for you if you are diagnosed with an incurable, debilitating, painful disease. Do your own research. Ask your family to research and face the harsh reality with you. Ask your doctor to be brutally honest with you. Then make your personal choice about how you will proceed. It is YOUR choice.

The 'culture of cure' has led to a fairy tale belief that doctors can always fix our problems. We have lost sight of reality. All life ends. Death is not necessarily the enemy in all cases. Sometimes a gentle passing is a gift. 

Misguided doctors caught up in an aspirational belief that they must extend life, whatever the cost, cause individuals and families unnecessary suffering. Brittany stood up to bullies. She never thought anyone else had the right to tell her how long she should suffer. The right to die for the terminally ill is a human rights issue. Plain and simple.

Brittany's Momma

'As Brittany Maynard's mother, I find it difficult to believe that anyone who knew her would ever select this word to describe her actions.

Monsignor Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, head of the Pontifical Academy for Life, made the remarks just two days after Miss Maynard, 29, took a lethal prescription of drugs at her Oregon home.

 Speaking to Italian news agency Ansa, he said: 'This woman (took her own life) thinking she would die with dignity, but this is the error. Suicide is not a good thing.

'It is a bad thing because it is saying no to life and to everything it means with respect to our mission in the world and towards those around us.'

Monsignor Carrasco de Paula, whose Academy is responsible for ethical issues in the Catholic Church, even went so far as to describe assisted suicide, in itself, as a reprehensible 'absurdity'.

He added: 'Dignity is something different to putting an end to your own life.'

The Roman Catholic Church opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide, teaching that life starts at the moment of conception and should end at the moment of natural death. 

Ms Maynard was diagnosed in January with stage IV glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer. 

In April, doctors gave her just six months to live.

She hit headlines around the world and became the face of the right-to-die movement after revealing her plans to end her own life under Oregon's Death with Dignity Act.

She passed away in the arms of her husband, Dan Diaz, and surrounded by friends and family in her home in Portland.

On the day of her death, she posted an emotional message to her loved ones and supporters via Facebook according to People. It read:  'Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love.

'Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me … but would have taken so much more.

'The world is a beautiful place, travel has been my greatest teacher, my close friends and folks are the greatest givers. I even have a ring of support around my bed as I type.

'Goodbye world. Spread good energy. Pay it forward!' 

Sean Crowley, a spokesman for Compassion & Choices, said in a statement that Ms Maynard has been suffering 'increasingly frequent and longer seizures' and severe head pain.

He added: 'As symptoms grew more severe she chose to abbreviate the dying process by taking the aid-in-dying medication she had received months ago.' 

At the end of last month, Ms Maynard, who married Mr Diaz at Beltane Ranch, California in 2012, managed to tick off the last item on her bucket list: a visit to the Grand Canyon. 

She revealed on her website that she had managed to travel from her home in Oregon to Arizona with her husband, mother and stepfather 'thanks to the kindness of Americans around the country who came forward to make my 'bucket list' dream come true'.

Mr Diaz described Ms Maynard as a 'beautiful person on the inside' with a 'personality you really get attracted to' just weeks before her death.

Talking to People.com in October, the 43-year-old spoke of when they first met, saying at first glance she was beautiful, but as they grew closer he realized she was also stunning on the inside. 

'For me it was meeting the person I fell in love with and that was Brittany. Jokingly, she would say I'd certainly been single long enough because there was an age difference between us,' he said.

'And 'What's taken me so long?' and my answer was, honestly, that I hadn't met the girl for me until Brittany.'

He said that he quickly realized that she was the woman he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. They met when he was 35 and she was 23. 

After a five-year romance Mr Diaz proposed in May 2012, and the pair decided to get married that December. They tied the knot in the romantic setting of Beltane Ranch, California.
