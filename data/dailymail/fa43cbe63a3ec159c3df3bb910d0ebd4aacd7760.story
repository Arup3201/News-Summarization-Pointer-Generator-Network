The sister and niece of U.S. comedian Sarah Silverman have been detained in Jerusalem's Old City for wearing prayer shawls that tradition dictates are to be worn only by Orthodox Jewish men.

Rabbi Susan Silverman and 17-year-old Hallel Silverman were among ten people detained at the Western Wall, one of the holiest sites in all of Judaism. 

Susan is from the Reform stream of Judaism and belong to ‘Women of the Wall,’ a liberal group that goes to the sacred site every month to worship and protest inequality for women in the religion.

Defiance: Several women, including Hallel Silverman, sit down on the pavement in defiance of police attempting to make arrests

However, the Wailing Wall operates under the deeply conservative Orthodox ritual law and bars women from wearing prayer shawls, called tallits, or publically reading from the scriptures.

Outspoken: Sarah Silverman, pictured Saturday at the BAFTA awards, tweeted her support for her sister's 'civil disobedience'

She told the New York Daily News from Jerusalem that was ‘proud to take a stand for something I believe in,’ adding that there is a great inequality at the Jewish holy site, calling the rules banning women from wearing shawls and reading the Torah are ‘outdated.’

Sarah Silverman wrote on her Twitter page that she was 'SO proud' of her sister and niece for their 'civil disobedience,’ as well as more crass language typical of the outspoken comedian.

Her niece Hallel cheekily tweeted back: ‘hey auntie, want a copy of my mugshot?’

She later said that the authorities ‘let us out after four hours or so,’ and that being detained ‘wasn’t too bad.’

The women were also banned from visiting the Wall for a fortnight.

According to the Jerusalem Post, around 150 women and a few dozen men attended the monthly ceremony.

Though guards confiscate any tallit from women entering the Wall at a security checkpoint, prayer shawls were smuggled in by men who supported the women’s cause.

Susan Silverman told Haaretz in a 2010 profile that her sister’s dirty humor had something of a holy purpose, much like her own religious protests. ‘Sarah’s really calling out the ills of society. She’s saying: I’m not interested in your rituals, in what you pray and what you say.

‘I’m interested in the fact that we live in this really racist society, that we live in this really violent world. She’s interested in the things that God actually is interested in.’

Anat Hoffman, the founder of ‘Women of the Wall’ and one of the ten detained, told the Associated Press that they were stopped because of their choice of wardrobe.

Ever eloquent: Silverman wrote that she was 'so proud' of her sister and niece, but also included some signature vulgarity

Escorted: The mother and daughter were escorted out of the premises by Israeli police and were detained for several hours

The group conducts certain rituals, such as wearing prayer shawls and skullcaps and singing out loud, practices reserved for men under strict Orthodox interpretations of Judaism.

Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the women were detained because they acted against court-ordered regulations that bar women from wearing prayer shawls at the Western Wall so as not to offend Orthodox Jewish worshippers. 

The group has been gathering at the Western Wall for a quarter century, but in recent years its activists have been increasingly detained by police. Ms Hoffman, who chairs the group, said no woman detained has ever been formally charged with any crime.

'This is just attrition,' said Ms Hoffman. 'They want to the group to become frightened.'

Comfort: Silverman hugs her daughter after her arrest; the prayer was organized by the Women of Wall, a group which calls for rights of women to pray at Judaism's holiest site without restriction

Beliefs: Police warned the women wearing prayer shawls and made 10 arrests as the women left the morning prayers session. Orthodox Jews traditionally believe that prayer shawls should only be should only be worn by men

The Monday detentions took place after about 300 people gathered at a prayer service at the Western Wall to protest Orthodox control of the site. 

Among the worshippers in the group, Ms Hoffman said, were about 100 male supporters, including veterans from the legendary Israeli paratroopers' battalion that captured Jerusalem's ancient walled Old City, including the Western Wall, in the 1967 Middle East War.

In December, after Ms Hoffman was arrested under similar circumstances, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the head of the semi-governmental Jewish Agency to come up with solutions that would allow for non-Orthodox women to pray freely at the site.

Ms Hoffman said two of the women held by police were American rabbis from the egalitarian Conservative Jewish movement who missed a scheduled meeting with the Jewish Agency chief to discuss the very issue that landed them in police custody.
