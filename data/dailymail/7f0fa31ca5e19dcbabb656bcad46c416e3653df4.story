surrounding Lake Mead just before 5pm.

A company reservations agent said flight operations were suspended for the day.

Morning television news video showed a
 charred crash site amid scrub brush in a canyon west of the edge of the
 Colorado River reservoir some 30 miles from the Las Vegas Strip.

A security guard from the national 
recreation area heard the crash and reported seeing smoke about four 
miles west of the lake's edge.

Mr Munoz told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that he was 'saddened' that a search-and-rescue mission turned 
into a 'recovery investigation.'

He added that it was too early to release the names of the victims, however local news revealed the pilot's name.

The crash site about 30 miles from the Las Vegas Strip is not accessible by road.

FAA
 spokesman Ian Gregor said several witnesses reported smoke and what 
appeared to be wreckage in the area where police were investigating.

Mr Gregor said police were having troubling reaching the crash site because it's in a ravine.

The tour helicopter was an Aerospatiale AS350, which can hold up to six passengers and are often used for air tours.

A spokesman for the helicopter 
company, who declined to give his name, said the tour was not full. He 
declined to answer further questions.

It's unclear what may have triggered the crash.

The weather was mostly clear near Lake Mead yesterday, with a low temperature around 29 and winds around 5 mph. 

The company which operates the tours, Sundance Helicopters, is no stranger to fatal accidents.

Nevada officials offered their thoughts and prayers today for the victims.

Senate
 Majority Leader Harry Reid said: 'My thoughts this morning are with the
 families of the five people who died in a terrible crash yesterday.

Previous accidents: The 2003 crash, which took place near the Grand Canyon, was caused when the helicopter's main rotor blade struck the wall

'Hundreds
 of thousands of tourists enjoy these popular helicopter tours of Nevada
 each year, and I'm saddened that people lost their lives in this rare 
tragedy. I am grateful for the efforts of National Park Service rangers,
 Metro Police's Search and Rescue and the Clark County and Henderson 
fire departments, who responded to the scene.

'I
 will continue to monitor the investigation being performed by the 
Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board
 and will do everything I can to ensure that helicopter tours remain 
safe.'

Seven people were killed in September 2003 when a helicopter hit a wall near the Grand Canyon.

Deadly tour: The helicopter was returning from the Hoover Dam with the pilot and four passengers aboard when it crashed outside of Las Vegas

Cardiologist Dr. Joseph F. Hanna and his wife Nouhad Majdalany were among the six civilians killed alongside the 44-year old pilot.

The National Transportation Safety 
Board's report into that accident determined that 'the probable cause of
 this accident was the pilot’s disregard of safe flying procedures and 
misjudgment of the helicopter's proximity to terrain, which resulted in 
an in-flight collision with a canyon wall.

There was video evidence to support 
passenger complaints that the pilot -  nicknamed 'Kamizaze' by 
colleagues - was prone to veering close to canyon walls, and performing 
risky manoeuvres.

The company received two complaints about the pilot in 2001 and though it initially said it would suspend the pilot, the ban was never enforced.

One tourist who recently took a similar tour 
told MailOnline that his pilot prompted him to pay a tip in exchange for
 a more exciting flight.

He said: 'The pilot told us that he 
was so low-paid that all tips were gratefully received, and that in 
exchange for the tip he would perform some low-level flying.

'He flew close to the ground and close to the walls, on the edge of things, for more excitement.

'I didn't feel I was in danger at the time but I did think he was taking more risks than he needed to.'

Sundance Helicopters' website promotes only one local tour that flies over Lake Mead.

The 30-minute 'Twilight City Tour' spans downtown Las Vegas, the Hoover Dam and the Las Vegas Strip.

Packages start at $210 per person. 'Fly in a state of the art luxury air-conditioned 6 passenger jet helicopter,' the company says on its website.
