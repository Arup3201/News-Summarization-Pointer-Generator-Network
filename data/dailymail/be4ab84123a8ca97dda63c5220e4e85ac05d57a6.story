Danny Welbeck's Arsenal hat-trick was the story on everyone's lips on Thursday morning, but the FA still think he is a Manchester United player. 

Roy Hodgson's England squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia has been announced, but in a gaffe from the FA, the official squad sheet listed Welbeck as a Manchester United player, despite his move to the Emirates.

Arsenal signed Welbeck for £16million on deadline day in September, and scored his first career hat-trick for the Gunners on Wednesday night.

Until his move to north London, Welbeck had spent the whole of his professional contract at United, bar loan moves to Preston and Sunderland.

He made his debut for the Old Trafford outfit in 2008, but after six years and 92 appearances, called a halt to his United career and moved to Arsenal.

Welbeck was picked alongside Wayne Rooney and Rickie Lambert to lead the line for his country, but the striker's time at United still appears to live long in the memory of someone at the FA.
