A Nigerian woman has been crowned Muslim Miss World in the final of a beauty pageant organised by a women's group in direct response to the mainstream Miss World competition taking place in Indonesia.

Miss Nigeria, Obabiyi Aishah Ajibola, 21, won the Miss Muslimah World contest which was organised by the World Muslimah Foundation, a Muslim women's group, and held in Indonesia's capital city of Jakarta as a protest to the traditional contest being held in Bali this month.

The annual Muslim event - now in its 
third year - is held exclusively for Muslim women, who are assessed not 
only their appearance (in Islamic dress) but also their piety, religious
 knowledge and understanding of the Koran.

More than 500 Muslim women entered the contest online, with 20 finalists chosen by judges. Entrants were asked to talk people through their path to the religion and what wearing a headscarf meant to them.

When Miss Nigeria was announced the winner - and won a trip to Mecca - she recited a verse from the Koran. 

Meanwhile in Bali, the
 mainstream pageant was subject to protests by hard-line Muslims within 
the world's most populous Muslim country, even though organisers 
relented and agreed to cancel the bikini round.

Moreover, its final - held on 28 
September - was due to take place in Jakarta, but it has now been agreed
 that the whole pageant will take place in Bali, a Hindu-majority island, where armed police are 
on high alert following warnings that the contest could be a target for 
terror attacks.

Following protests around Indonesia opposing the Miss World competition taking place in Bali, female contestants have warned to be vigilant against possible terror attacks on the island.

The British, US and Australian Embassies in Jakarta have warned the women taking part - three of whom are from the UK -  that extremist groups may be planning to 
disrupt the pagean.

The competition final takes place in Bali on 28 September.

The British Embassy said that 'local Islamist vigilante groups 
have threatened to hold large-scale demonstrations to disrupt the Miss 
World pageant', adding 'extremist groups may also be planning to attack the event'.

Terrorist bombs killed 202 people in Bali in 2002, 30 of whom were British.
