An Ecuadorian boy with a severe facial deformity is due to fly home from New York next week after going under the surgeon's knife ten times to fix a potentially fatal condition.Â 

Ten-year-old Kevin Rosero was brought to the U.S. in January by Blanca's House, a charity that works to improve access to modern healthcare.

When he arrived for surgery at Stony Brook University Hospital Kevin could not speak English and he hid his face in a scarf so no one would see his lip.

He was suffering from a 'massive venous malformation' that made it difficult for Kevin to eat, and the soccer fan had other medical issues that doctors feared could lead to blindness or even death, according to Long Island Newsday.

'It was hard for him, not only from a 
functional perspective, but just knowing - looking at yourself every 
day,' Dr Alexander Dagum said. 'So, it's a change, and now he's a normal, 
good-looking boy with no functional issues.'

Kevin is also pleased with his new look after the surgery, telling Long Island News: 'I look in the mirror and I look pretty handsome. They saved my life.'

Dr Dagum fist met Kevin when he was 
performing free surgeries in Ecuador, and realized the best chance the 
boy had was to come to Long Island to be operated on.

In the past year he has had surgery ten 
times, and also had dental work done. Doctors explained that his abnormality had
 affected his cheek, tongue, larynx and lips.

Since he arrived in the U.S. Kevin has been living with foster parents Sheila and Brian Campbell. Mrs Campbell, a Blanca's House volunteer, said he attended elementary school and has become fluent in English during his stay.

Treat: The university soccer team gave Kevin a ball and let him sit on the bench for a match after hearing about his bravery

She said: 'He's the bravest boy I ever met.'

On Friday, Stony Brook arranged a send off for the soccer-loving child, which included a chance to meet the hospital's team, who presented him with a signed ball, T-shirt and seat on the bench for last night's match.

'When we heard about Kevin's story, we were truly, truly amazed by the strength and the courage that he's shown - not just over the last eight months, but throughout the course of his life,' Seawolves coach Ryan Anatol said.
