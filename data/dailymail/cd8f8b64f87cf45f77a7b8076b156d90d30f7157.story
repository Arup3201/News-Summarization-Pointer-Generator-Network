Anthony Briggs leader of Havant Borough Council wants to change the name of the area

A council leader has been ridiculed by locals over his plans to change a borough’s name from Havant – because he says it sounds like ‘have not’.

Anthony Briggs says he wants to ‘improve the area’s image by getting rid of its negative name’.

But the bizarre idea has been dismissed by local residents proud of the fact that Havant’s name was recorded in the Domesday Book.

The Tory council leader is calling for a public consultation to change the name because it ‘sounds like the haves and the have nots’.

Mr Briggs, who has been the borough leader for five years, said: ‘I think it’s unfortunate what the word Havant portrays. It sounds like have not. We live in a part of the country which has the coast and the South Downs and it’s a wonderful place.

‘I think a name such as South East Hampshire has a much better ring to it than Havant.

‘The name is very negative but unfortunately people do get attached to place names.

‘There are many places in our borough, not just the town Havant, and as we share services with other councils I think, to move forward, we should change the name.

‘It is confusing to people. When I go abroad and I’m asked where I come from, I tell them and they have no idea where it is.’

Mr Briggs added the council could hold a competition to choose a new name.

But Chris Everitt, chairman of the Havant Group Business Centre said: ‘I’ve never heard of anything so ridiculous and this just shows how out of touch politicians are with the residents they are supposed to represent.

‘There will be a lot of opposition. People here are proud and there is no way they would stand to lose such an important part of their heritage.’

The borough of Havant has had its name since 1086 and locals say it is 'ridiculous' to suggest it should change

The Hampshire borough – between Chichester and Portsmouth on the South Coast – derived its name from the village of Havant, which had a population of about 100 in 1086, when the Domesday Book was written.

The village was known as Hamafunta around 935 AD, which translates as the spring of man, named after springs in the area.

Sophie Fullerlove, director of Havant’s The Spring arts and heritage centre, said: ‘The history and name of Havant are very important to the area. It comes from the local springs, which were fundamental to the village.

‘The water was used to make parchment which, legend has it, was used for  the Magna Carta and Treaty of Versailles.

‘I don’t agree the name has a negative connotation and I don’t think locals have a problem with it either.

‘We would welcome a visit from councillors to the heritage centre to learn exactly how the borough got its name and how important it is.’
