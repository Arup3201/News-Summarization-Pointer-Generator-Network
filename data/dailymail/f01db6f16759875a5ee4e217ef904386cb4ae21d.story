The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a new mission – to capture an asteroid, send a spaceship to it and collect samples before returning home in less than a month round trip.

In an effort to attain a better understanding of asteroids, meteors and other near-space objects, the space exploration arm of the US government plans to capture an asteroid, fly a crew to it in a next-generation spacecraft, take samples and return home to a splashdown in the ocean. Funding for the project is included in the space agency’s upcoming budget.

The latest version of the plan was revealed in an animation made public Thursday on YouTube that has a soundtrack that sounds like it came from the ‘Dark Knight.’

We have liftoff: Crews will ride the next-generation Orion spacecraft to the captured asteroid

Details on how exactly NASA plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not known, but the rendering shows it captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag attached to solar panels that flare out to the side like wings.

Called an ‘asteroid redirect mission,’ it resembles more of a capture, and involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, which will also be used for trips to the Moon and Mars, according to NASA.

In-flight: Using a combination of solar power and gravity-aided thrust, the Orion will make the 10 day trip to the asteroid

Almost there!: Once arrived, the Orion will dock with the captured asteroid

Though it bares a striking resemblance to the earlier Apollo Spacecraft, Orion can hold more crew and is far-more advanced, says NASA.

Up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid, compared to the maximum three in Apollo, in a trip that utilizes both solar power and the Moon’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft , according to the video.

Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows.

The precious: The crew will then take pictures and samples of the captive space rock before returning to the Orion for the 10 day sojourn home

Once the mission is complete, Orion returns to earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loop around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video.

Announced in the aftermath of the asteroid that exploded over Russia last year, injuring well over a thousand people, NASA plans to dedicate $100 million to this project in the coming year, the agency said. 

It is not clear where the leftover asteroid would be jettisoned to, if anywhere, nor is there word on what effect changing the orbit of one near-Earth object would have, let alone several. Near-Earth objects are defined as those within 28 million miles of our home planet.

Home sweet home: The trip ends with a gentle splashdown in the ocean

Explaining the government supports NASA’s ‘efforts to study Near Earth Objects,’ Space subcommittee chairman Steven Palazzo (R-MS) said during a recent hearing that the ‘this proposal lacks in details, a justification or support from the NASA own advisory bodies’ and ‘appears to be a costly and complex distraction.’

Undeterred, NASA is moving forward, the agency expects to capture its first asteroid by 2025.
