This terrifying clip shows the moment blood-red fluid began leaking along the walls of a bus - in a scene straight out of horror movie The Shining.

As the oozing liquid drips down into a huge puddle on the bus floor, panicked passengers are heard repeatedly urging the driver to stop the vehicle and open the doors.

The incident occurred on March 19 on a 99 B-line bus bound for the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. 

Passengers on a Vancouver bus became panicked as a blood-red fluid began dripping down the walls of the vehicle in a scene reminiscent of cult horror movie The Shining

Luka Jason, who posted the video, joked the 'bus might need an exorcism'.  In two days, the 90-second clip has amassed almost 50,000 views.

The caption adds: 'A little bit of panic ensued in this packed bus behind me as you can hear from all the voices.'  

One person is heard speculating the fluid may be hazardous, adding: 'What is that? It stinks.'

Commenter EloynAmmillio believes the fluid is 'similar to anti-freeze that is part of the air conditioning system' that sits on top of the rear cab of the bus.  

'Apparently a hose burst somewhere and let it all out of the radiator. It is toxic to get into the eyes and mouth and can be irritating to skin if allowed long exposure.'  

But according to bus company TransLink, it was a non-toxic and non-flammable leak of hydraulic fluid - although some types can cause irritation to the skin and eyes, and be toxic if swallowed.

Chris Bryan, a spokesperson for the company, told Vancity Buzz: 'TransLink take all leaks very seriously. All incidents are promptly and thoroughly investigated.

'Once repairs are made, our vehicles are road tested prior being returned to service. At no time were passengers in any danger.'

The cause of the leak is not known, but the vehicle resumed operation after a two-hour repair.

Mr Bryan added the safe steering of the bus was not affected.

'We apologize to any of our passengers who may have been distressed by the incident,' he added.   

In 1980's The Shining, an adaptation of the novel by Stephen King, a family heads to the isolated Overbrook Hotel, but an evil spirit sends the father - played by Jack Nicholson - on a violent rampage.

The trailer for the movie consisted solely of the iconic shot of a rive of blood pouring out of an elevator.
