New Zealand fly-half Dan Carter will make his much-awaited comeback following a six-month rest in a minor club match for a provincial side in Canterbury on Saturday.

The All Blacks star - who is the world record international points scorer with 1,440 - will play for Southbridge in a local championships match against Glenmark.

Carter began his career at Southbridge, where he was born, before he signed for Canterbury in 2002.

Hometown: The 32-year-old expects to play 40 minutes for Southbridge, his first provincial club in Canterbury

However, the 32-year-old - who was allowed a similar 'sabbatical' to the one captain Richie McCaw took last season by the New Zealand Rugby Union - said he does not expect to play a full 80 minutes on his return.

Carter, who has 100 All Black caps, said: '(I will) just ease my way back into it on what will more than likely be a heavy, wet track.

'I am probably only looking at 40 minutes or so, but it will just be good to get some game time.'

Carter also played for Southbridge in 2009 when he returned from an Achilles tendon injury.

Pedigree: Carter has 100 All Blacks caps and is the world record international points scorer with 1,440

Rest: New Zealand captain Richie McCaw was allowed a similar sabbatical last season by the NZRU
