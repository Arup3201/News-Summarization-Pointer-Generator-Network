Fraud: Derek Snelling, pictured outside court today, withdrew up to £38,000 from bank accounts belonging to his late mother, Ellen, and used the money to go on a string of exotic holidays 

A son has admitted to stealing more than £30,000 from his late 93-year-old mother after she accused him of taking the money in a police interview recorded before her death.

Derek Snelling withdrew up to £38,000 from bank accounts belonging to his mother, Ellen, and used the money to go on a string of exotic holidays.

He originally denied the fraud charges against him but changed his plea after watching the video of his mother on the second day of his trial at Exeter Crown Court.

During the police interview, Mrs Snelling, who died just months after the police interview in 2013, said she wanted 'wring his bloomin' neck' after finding out what he had done. 

Snelling, from Hartland, Devon, stole his mother's money over a six year period between 2007 and 2013, prosecutor James Taghdissian told the court. 

The 67-year-old, who lived off a state pension and disability allowance, became the signatory on his mother's accounts in order to pay bills and withdraw her pension for her.

His actions came to light when his own children became suspicious over him taking a string of holidays and a Caribbean cruise when he had  been declared bankrupt in 2005.

Two of his daughters, Shelley Cornish and Glenda Pengilly, took their grandmother to her bank and discovered sums of money had been taken.

They later found that Snelling had also taken money from accounts set up by Ellen Snelling for her grandchildren and great-grandchildren to pay off his overdraft

Snelling, who has moved to Wickford, Essex, since his arrest, denied four counts of fraud but changed his plea on the second day of his trial.

He took between £30,000 and £38,000 from his mother and smaller amounts totalling less than £1,000 from his grandchildren. 

Mrs Snelling was interviewed by police in April 2013 and died in September the same year.

In the taped interview, she said Snelling was 'paying all the bills for her and he had all her money and went to the Post Office to withdraw her pension'.

The court heard she did not spend much money because of her age and allowed her son to handle her affairs.  

Mr Taghdissian said: 'He was spending large sums of money and living beyond his means.'

He said there was no dispute that Snelling was responsible for the transactions and 'his children did not approve of him being the signatory'.

He said Snelling and his partner, now his wife, went on foreign holidays and a Caribbean cruise and 'the only way he was going to do it was by stealing his mother's money'.

And the prosecutor said when he was no longer signatory on his mother's accounts her spending went down. 

Snelling said in police interviews that his mother's memory was poor and he said he had repaid money to her – and that holidays to Tunisia and Lanzarote had been paid by his wife.

The court heard he admitted putting £4,000 of his mum's money into 'someone else's name' and told one of his daughters it would be his if she died.

He produced two undated notes which claimed that his mother had given him £1,500 as a present and another saying she had consented to let him have her money.

Mr Taghdissian said: 'He was using his mother's money as his own.'

Snelling denied four charges of fraud but changed his plea after his mum had given her video evidence.

John Dyer, defending, asked for the case to be adjourned so prosecution and defence could agree a figure for how much was stolen, which he said would be below £38,000.

Snelling will be sentenced later.
