Comedian Jim Davidson has been told that he will not be prosecuted over a claim that he assaulted a woman while he was on a trip to entertain troops in the 1980s

Comedian Jim Davidson has been completely cleared of sex assault allegations.

The former Generation Game host said he was ‘absolutely delighted’ after learning yesterday that he won’t be charged over an alleged offence in the Falklands Islands.

It comes four months after the Crown Prosecution Service ruled he shouldn’t be charged over ten alleged sex offences in the UK.

Mr Davidson told the Daily Mail: ‘I’ve always refuted the allegations in both the UK and the Falkland Islands.

Now the authorities have decided there will be no further action in both cases.’

‘I’m particularly pleased about the Falkland Islands because there is no place I love more. I’ve been there at least eight times, it is a special place and the people there are wonderful.’

The Falklands claim made by a woman dated from the 1980s when Davidson visited to entertain troops.

In August, officers from Scotland Yard told the 60-year-old that he would face no further action after he had spent eight months on bail following his arrest on suspicion of sexual offences.

Prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence in relation to ten allegations.

He was first arrested in January by detectives from Operation Yewtree, the national investigation sparked by the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal, and re-arrested in March after further allegations emerged.

Details of the allegation in the Falklands emerged in May. The investigation was carried out by Yewtree detectives on behalf of the Royal Falkland Islands Police, which has only 16 full-time officers. 

Critics have claimed Yewtree has become a runaway train, with an ‘arrest first, gather evidence later’ policy. Scotland Yard chiefs insist it is ‘fair and proportionate’.

A file on the Falklands case was sent
some weeks ago to the islands’ Attorney General, Mark Lewis, who 
consulted lawyers before deciding Davidson should not be prosecuted.

Had Mr Lewis authorised charges, the five-times married comic would have had to travel 8,000 miles to stand trial.

Davidson’s
solicitor Henri Brandman said last night: ‘My client, Jim Davidson, is 
delighted to have received news today that there will be no further 
action relating to an allegation of an historic sexual nature in the 
Falkland Islands.’

A 
spokesman for the Falkland Islands government said: ‘Following 
consideration of the file of evidence in relation to allegations against
Mr James Cameron Davidson, the Attorney General of the Falkland Islands
has directed that no further action will be taken.

The complainant and Mr Davidson have been informed of this decision.’ 

After
his arrest in January, Davidson told friends: ‘I am no Jimmy Savile. I 
have never forced myself on a girl in my life. I am a gentleman.’ 

Former
Radio One DJ Dave Lee Travis, veteran entertainer Rolf Harris and PR 
mogul Max Clifford have all been charged with sex offences following 
inquiries by Yewtree. They are due to stand  trial next year.
