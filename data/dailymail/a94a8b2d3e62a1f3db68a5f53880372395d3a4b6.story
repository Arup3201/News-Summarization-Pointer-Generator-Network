Two police officers were injured and four people arrested when violence broke out between English Defence League marchers and counter-demonstrators today.

Bottles and railings were hurled and at least one smoke bomb was set off as the anti-Islamic group marched through the centre of Slough, Berkshire, where antifascists were waiting.

Officers were forced to don riot gear and let dogs loose in an effort to quell the violence, which resulted in four people being held for public order offences.

Street fighting: Scuffles break out as English Defence League supporters come face a barrage of missiles from anti fascists in Slough while the anti-Islamic group staged a protest in the Berkshire town earlier today

One police officer suffered facial injuries and another had an injury to his leg.

The
 EDL's march through Slough was in protest against plans for an 
all-girls Muslim faith school in the city and a Muslim community centre 
in Langley.

It was met by 
counter-demonstrations led by the Slough Trades Union Council and the 
Anti-Fascist Network, who accuse the EDL of fascist 
tendencies.

The march 
descended into violence as EDL supporters entered Slough's High 
Street, where street fighting broke out with both police and antifascists.

Authorities
 estimate that up to 600 people took park in the opposing 
demonstrations, which were policed by officers from across Thames Valley
 Police, Hampshire Constabulary and the British Transport Police.Â

Disorder: EDL supporters wave Welsh and Israeli flags and shout slogans during their demonstration, which was in protest against a new Muslim school and an Islamic community centre which are planned for the area

A
 police spokesman said: 'The two opposing demonstrations held in Slough 
passed off without major incident for Thames Valley Police and Slough 
Borough Council.

'It is 
estimated that between 500 to 600 people took part in both 
demonstrations, one by the English Defence League and a counter 
demonstration.

'A number of
 officers from across Thames Valley Police, Hampshire Constabulary and 
British Transport Police were visible during the demonstrations as part 
of a pre-planned comprehensive and proportionate policing operation.

'A
 small amount of disorder did break out in the town centre. However 
officers quickly dealt with the incidents and maintained control of the 
situation. Four people were arrested for various public order offences.

'Two officers were injured during the demonstration; one sustained facial injuries and the other an injury to his leg.'

No pasaran! Black-clad antifascists clash with police as they try to oppose the EDL's march down Slough's High Street, where bottles and railings were hurled and at least one smoke bomb let off during the fracas

Superintendent
 Simon Bowden, local police commander for Slough, said: 'I am pleased 
that these demonstrations have passed off without major incident.

'Disruption was kept to a minimum and we are grateful for the support we received from local communities.

'There
 were a handful of arrests made over the course of the day, mainly for 
public disorder. However, the vast majority of those taking part were 
well behaved.

'The 
demonstrations had understandably caused a great deal of concern amongst
 some of our communities and I would like to thank them for their 
tolerance, co-operation and patience.'

Councillor
 Rob Anderson, leader of Slough Borough Council, said: 'It was a shame 
that some elements felt the need to resort to violence but the police 
dealt with it swiftly and appropriately.

'Hopefully we can get back to normal in Slough now these groups have left our town.'
