Depressed: Dr Clive Blackburn jumped to his death from the roof of Unilever in Bedfordshire just hours after being made redundant from his high-powered job

A top food scientist jumped to his death from the roof of his work laboratory just hours after being made redundant, an inquest has heard.

Dr Clive Blackburn - who developed products for big brand names including Slimfast and Lipton Tea - could not cope with losing his position at food giant Unilever, so meticulously planned his death.

He went to the deserted Unilever building on a Saturday - the day after finishing work for the last time - and duped security staff by saying he was collecting personal belongings.

The 48-year-old planned his suicide even adding the date of his death and the length of his employment at the Unilever development laboratories on a social networking site the day before he died.

He had not been able to handle being made redundant and saw his GP on several occasions leading up to his death complaining of depression.

Coroner David Morris told the 
inquest: 'He was made redundant with his last working day on November 
11.

'It appears he gained access to the building at around 4pm on 
November 12 having asked security for his swipe card to collect his 
belongings.

'Security staff became concerned when they couldn’t locate him after several hours and called the police.

'His body was eventually found lying on grass on the grounds of the site.

'The cause of his death was recorded as multiple bone and soft tissue injuries, consistent with a fall from height.'

Paramedics were called to the Unilever site in Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, in the early hours of November 13 but the eminent doctor, who was influential in the food science world, was pronounced dead at the scene.

His body was found
on a grassed area at the back of the complex.

Scene of tragedy: Colworth Science Park in Sharnbrook, near Bedford, where Dr Clive Blackburn threw himself off the roof of his laboratory

He was told by company directors that he was at risk of being made redundant last May and colleagues reported him behaving strangely at work after that point, the inquest in Bedford heard.

He regularly saw his GP, Dr Jonathan Wali, suffering from depression and confided that he felt he had no hope for the future.

He told his GP that he was turning up for work and 'going through the motions' but had been dreading being out of work.

He was being considered for second interviews for potential jobs but Dr Blackburn told his GP his last day at the company was 'looming large in his thoughts.'

Talented: Dr Blackburn worked on big brand names including Slimfast and Lipton Tea

Dr Blackburn had worked at the company for 15 years and had updated his profile on social network site LinkedIn shortly before his death to read 1963 - 2011 and the end of employment with Unilever as November 2011, after three years and three months as the Group Leader, Drinks Design department.

Dr Blackburn had been employed at the Unilever offices since 1996 developing ice-cream production, instant tea and improving the shelf life of food.

For the past three years he had been the manager of a team of 20 employees and had been developing ready-to-consume drinks on behalf of Slimfast, Lipton tea and soya based products.

Coroner Morris added: 'He was a highly intelligent and highly qualified scientist who struggled with anxiety. With the impending redundancy he developed severe depression.

'I have no alternative but to record a verdict that he took his own life, whilst suffering from acute depression.'
