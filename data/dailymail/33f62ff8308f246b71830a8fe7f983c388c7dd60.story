The walls are riddled with bullet holes next to an abandoned carousel in one of the destroyed shops in Kenya’s Westgate Mall in Nairobi.

It has been four months since al-Shabaab terrorists entered the shopping centre armed with guns and explosives, killing 72 people and injuring hundreds.

The smell of decay lingers as the scale of the damage becomes apparent during the clean-up process in the Nairobi mall.

Broken memories: A glass door is pierced by several bullet holes,left by the al-Shabaab militants who attacked the shopping centre on September 21 last year

Photographers have been allowed into 
Westgate for the first time since the September terrorist attack, and 
their images show the destruction which still remains.

The car park has been reduced to a pile of rubble, while shops are stained by fire damage and riddled with gaping bullet holes.

The
 attack has been blamed on four al-Shabaab militants, who stormed the 
building armed with AK-47 assault rifles and explosives -before firing 
on shoppers at random.

American
 photographer Jennifer Huxta, 36, was one of the few photojournalists 
given access to the devastated building in Nairobi today.

Destruction: The car park was almost completely destroyed when terrorists stormed the building armed with AK-47 assault rifles and explosives - before firing on shoppers at random

Traces of terrorism: Dozens of gaping bullet holes now adorn the walls of the shopping mall where 72 people were killed and hundreds were injured in September

Closed: The mall's pharmacy is boarded up and the neon sign remains turned off as repair work takes place

She said: ‘It is very eerie. There is still a lot of rubble and support beams sticking out of the concrete.

‘There is also a lot of fire damage and bullet holes, which are about 3cm wide.

‘You can smell bodies decaying, even though they say no bodies have been found in the clean-up operation.’

Diggers continue to remove the debris left behind by the collapse of the Nakumatt Supermarket.

Elsewhere,
 day labourers pick through the toxic rubble looking for metal pieces 
that can be transferred to the nearby Dandora dumpsite for recycling.

Jennifer,
 from Pennsylvania, said: ‘Tonnes of debris has already been removed, 
including the cars that were incinerated and crushed when the mall 
collapsed.

‘The debris left 
now is really just a load of metal. I did find a shoe and some office 
debris but apart from the bullet holes and fire damage there are not too
 many clues about what happened in there.

She added: ‘I saw about 30-35 day labourers who are getting about 500 shillings a day to pick through the rubble.

‘The
 rubble is quite toxic from the building materials and petrol and 
insulation but the workers don't seem to have gloves or protective 
clothing.’

She said most of 
the shops remain boarded up but renovations are already underway with a 
view to getting back to business as soon as possible.
