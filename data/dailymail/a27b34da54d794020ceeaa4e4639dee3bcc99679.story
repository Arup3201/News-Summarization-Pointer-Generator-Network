Welsh rugby fans have been urged by campaigners to stop singing the popular Tom Jones hit 'Delilah' because of its controversial lyrics.

Former Plaid Cymru president Dafydd Iwan has called on supporters at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium to find something else to sing, claiming the 1968 song 'trivialises the idea of murdering a woman'.

The song includes the lyrics: 'At break of day when that man drove away, I was waiting.

Delilah has become an unofficial anthem for Welsh rugby fans and Sir Tom Jones has even sung it to the crowds at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. However, a campaign to ban it has now been launched

The Welsh Men's Choir sing before the Autumn International between Wales and New Zealand last month 

'I cross the street to her house and she opened the door.

'She stood there laughing....I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more.'

Iwan, who held his senior role with Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, from 2003 to 2010, is also a folk singer. 

A general view of the exterior of Cardiff's Millennium Stadium 

I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window

I saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind

She was my woman

As she deceived me I watched and went out of my mind

My, my, my, Delilah

Why, why, why, Delilah

I could see that girl was no good for me

But I was lost like a slave that no man could free

At break of day when that man drove away, I was waiting

I cross the street to her house and she opened the door

She stood there laughing

I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more

My, my, my Delilah

Why, why, why Delilah

So before they come to break down the door

Forgive me Delilah I just couldn’t take any more

Quoted in several national newspapers, he said: 'It is a song about murder and it does tend to trivialise the idea of murdering a woman and it's a pity these words now have been elevated to the status of a secondary national anthem. I think we should rummage around for another song instead of Delilah.' 

The Welsh Rugby Union appears disinclined to ban the song, with a spokesman quoted by the South Wales Evening Post as saying: 'Within rugby, Delilah has gained prominence through its musicality rather than because of its lyrics.

'There is, however, plenty of precedent in art and literature, prominently in Shakespearean tragedies for instance, for negative aspects of life to be portrayed.

'The Welsh Rugby Union condemns violence against women and has taken a lead role in police campaigns to highlight and combat the issue.

'The WRU remains willing to listen to any strong public debate on the issue of censoring the use of Delilah but we have not been aware of any groundswell of opinion on this matter.'

Delilah, written by Les Reed, Barry Mason and Sylvan Whittingham, tells of an opportunistic killing by a man, who waits until his former partner's lover leaves her home before making his move.

The song is also commonly sung by supporters of Premier League football club Stoke.
