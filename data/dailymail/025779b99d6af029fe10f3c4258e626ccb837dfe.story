Diego Costa was left in tears after being forced off with a hamstring injury during Atletico Madrid's 1-1 draw with Barcelona, which sealed the La Liga title for Diego Simeone's men.

The 25-year-old, who had been struggling with a hamstring complaint in the build-up to Saturday's crucial clash at the Nou Camp, started the match but was replaced by Adrian Lopez after just 15 minutes.

It is believed Costa, who pulled up after a sprint forward, aggravated the same injury which caused him to miss last weekend's 1-1 draw with Malaga.

It
 is potentially very bad news for Atletico, who face a Champions League 
final 
against rivals Real Madrid in just seven days.

The Spanish 
international, who was set to lead the line for the reigning 
champions at the forthcoming World Cup, now faces an anxious wait as the severity of his latest injury is diagnosed.

Lightning struck twice for Atletico as Arda Turan was 
also forced off with injury in the first half of the game.

However the absence of both players didn't affect Simeone's side as they fought back from a goal down to win their first La Liga title in 18 years.

Alexis Sanchez put Barcelona into the lead, but Diego Godin's powerful header ensured Atleti finished above their opponents at the top of the table.
