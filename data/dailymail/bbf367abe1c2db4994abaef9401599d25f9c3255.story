Marouane Fellaini was delighted to score his first goal for Manchester United as he ended his injury hell by helping Louis van Gaal’s side to a point at West Brom.

The Belgium international came off the bench early in the second half to score United’s first goal in the 2-2 draw at The Hawthorns.

It was his first goal for United following his £27.5million move from Everton last summer and he hopes it will kick start his career at Old Trafford.

Speaking to MUTV, Fellaini said: 'It was a good feeling, I have waited for a long time for this moment and now I have scored, so I hope to score some more goals this season.'

Fellaini’s career at United has been plagued by injury and he has not yet shown the form from his Everton days.

The 26-year-old says he has worked hard to get back to full fitness and believes the best is yet to come from him.

Fellaini has also thanked Van Gaal for showing faith in him and vowed to repay him with goals.

'It was very difficult but I work hard every day and I know that when I am 100 per cent fit then I can be dangerous,' Marouane said.

'Football is like this, sometimes you have bad moments and that was one. But I am ready for the challenge and to play every game. I am happy here and the manager has shown trust in me. Every day in training, I work hard and after that the manager makes a decision.'

United were forced to come from behind twice against West Brom after Stephane Sessegnon gave the Baggies the lead before Fellaini levelled. Alan Irvine’s side then regained the lead through Saido Berahino before Daley Blind rescued a point late on for United.

West Brom caused a stir when their official Twitter account appeared to mock the midfielder as he was warming up. They posted posted: ‘Fellaini has now taken his tracksuit off, fortunately he has a Man Utd strip on underneath #WBAMUN’.

However Fellaini scored and after being criticised on social media, West Brom tweeted an apology of sorts: ‘Sorry if a joke about a footballer not having a shirt on under his tracksuit top has caused such outrage. It was not intended as a slur.’
