The London 2012 Games ended up £377million under budget, new figures showed today.

The overall cost of the Games is forecast to come in at £8.921billion from a budget of £9.298billion.

But this was still much higher than the original £2.4billion cost forecast when the bid was won in 2005.

The original budget for the London 2012 Games was £2.4billion, but rose to more than £9billion

Today the government hailed the underspend as 'prudent'.

Sports minister Hugh Robertson said: 'The work of the construction and delivery teams, from the ODA (Olympic Delivery Authority) and Locog (London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games), has set a very high standard and I have no doubt that London 2012 has set a new benchmark for the management of Olympic and Paralympic Games in future.'

Attempts to claw back millions from security firm G4s for its failure to provide thousands of guards just weeks before the Games started are still ongoing.

Mr Robertson said: 'There are projected savings of at least £377 million so the predictions that I made this summer that we could bring this project in at under £9 billion has almost certainly been met.

'Locog also have to conclude, and we have to sign off, the negotiations with G4S over the size of the amount of money that will be paid back to the public purse - so if you were to add to that £377 million, anything that will not be used but is held against outstanding work and anything that might come back from G4S, it is entirely reasonable to expect that figure to rise.'

The Olympic Delivery Authority's construction and transport programme came in £47million below the previous estimated figure

Some £103million of contingency is being held to cover the remaining risks in the programme. These include the retrofit of the Olympic Village to get it ready for use when it reopens after the Games.

There are also around 2,000 contracts with the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), the Olympic builders and London 2012 which still have to be closed out. In addition, £480million of uncommitted contingency still remains within the budget.The ODA's construction and transport programme has come in at £6.714billion, according to the estimates. This is a drop of £47 million on the previous estimated figure. The savings made by the ODA are now at £1.032 billion.

ODA chief executive Dennis Hone said: 'We are pleased to report even more savings made through careful stewardship of public money. We are now entering the final phase of the ODA's work, transforming the Olympic Village into thousands of new homes and building a community that will become established, grow and mature in the decades ahead - a London 2012 legacy for generations to come.'
