Former X-Factor contestant Simone Battle was found by her boyfriend hanged in closet of their Hollywood apartment just four hours after he last saw her alive. 

The G.R.L. singer was found dead around 8am on Friday morning. 

Battle's boyfriend last saw her alive at 3:45 a.m. Friday and then found her body about four hours later, according to Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter.

The autopsy conducted on Sunday determined that it was a suicide, Mr Winter said.

Meanwhile Anthony Battle said his daughter never showed any sign of depression.

He told TMZ although he he not spoken to his daughter on the phone for a few weeks, they exchanged texts everyday.

He said his daughter showed no signs of being down, but may have had an 'invisible disability.'

'She will be greatly missed and loved,' her father  told MailOnline.

'She was an exuberant person and a very loved person.' 

Battle's record company and management issued a joint statement on her passing.

'We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Simone Battle of G.R.L.' the statement from Reign Deer Entertainment, Kemosabe Records, RCA Records and Pussycat Dolls founder Robin Antin reads.

'Simone was an exceptional young talent and human being, and we are all devastated to learn of her passing. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and loved ones at this time.'

Friend and fellow-musician Derek Butler initially broke the news on Instagram.
