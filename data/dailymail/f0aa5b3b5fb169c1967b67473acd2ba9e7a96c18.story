Actress Anna Friel has hit back at an oil company which accused her of 'deliberately distorting the facts' in a charity appeal about plans to test for oil in Africa's oldest national park.

The Rochdale-born star, who repeatedly refers to the park as 'this place' in the three-minute plea, said she would have 'loved' to cross the border into the drilling site - but was not allowed to due to the 'armed conflict'.

She added that she used the phrase 'Behind me is Virunga National Park' - deeming the accusations 'pathetic' and 'paltry'.

Friel, who was filmed sat high on a mountain against a backdrop of thick jungle and glimmering lakes, told viewers that it is 'absolutely crazy' to contemplate 'exploring for oil right there'.

Anna Friel's appeal to save Africa's oldest national park, Virunga in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has been branded 'misleading' by the oil firm at the heart of plans to test for the natural resource

The actress and her daughter Gracie, eight, visited Uganda to film a three-minute plea on behalf of WWF. The 37-year-old said is it 'absolutely crazy' to contemplate exploring for oil at the World Heritage Site

But Soco, the London-based company set to
 start tests early next year in Virunga National Park, in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo, said the appeal was filmed 25 miles away from the 
drilling site.

The production, directed by Stephen Poliakoff, is being shown as one of the main trailers before films in more than 100 cinemas across the UK.

Friel's repetition of 'this place' throughout the film could suggest to viewers the 37-year-old is standing among the endangered habitat, Soco claims.Â 

However, the actress has hit back at the oil firm - saying: 'I am astonished at this paltry attempt to use semantics to divert attention from the real issue.

The plea was directed by Stephen Poliakoff, pictured with Anna Friel at the screening of the production in London on October 14

'I am delighted to have used the specific words "Behind me is Virunga National Park", and to be in the fortunate position of never having used any expression which may have indicated that I was other than where I was when filming.

'I would have loved to have been able to cross the border into the park but we were not allowed to due to the armed conflict.

'This is a pathetic attempt by Soco stop people focusing on the fact they are looking to explore for oil in a World Heritage site.'

Wildlife charity WWF claims the planned oil tests could 'devastate the fragile ecosystem', of the 3,000 sq m World Heritage Site, threatening the park's critically endangered mountain gorillas, the Times reported.

Friel did not visit Virunga because it lies inside the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against travelling there.

Instead, the film was shot 25 miles away, on a mountain top in neighbouring Uganda. From her vantage point the actress could see part of the sprawling site.

'Behind me is Virunga. I think it's one of the most beautiful places on our planet and they are about to start exploring for oil right there,' she tells viewers.

'It seems absolutely crazy. It is the last place on Earth we should think about doing such a thing.'

Soco said the area they plan to explore for oil, Block V, contains no gorillas.

The firm told the Times, Friel visited sites in Uganda, areas which bear little resemblance to the site in Virguna where seismic testing is scheduled to start early next year.

The company said: 'The clever use of animals and lush jungle shots depicted in the film that are simply not in the area of interest in Block V is misleading.

Wildlife charity WWF claim plans to explore parts of Virunga National Park for oil will threaten the critically endangered mountain gorilla population

'WWF must be aware of this and thus we can only conclude that the WWF is deliberately distorting the facts.'

He
 said the press release accompanying the film made it clear that Friel 
had travelled to Uganda, and added that care was taken to ensure the 
script was factually correct.

The team spent five days on the edge of the park and viewed reels of footage to learn more about the area at risk.

'It would have been great to take her there and if there had been any way of doing it safely we would have done so,' he added.

Roger Cagle, Soco's deputy chief executive criticised the WWF campaign for telling the DRC, the world's poorest nation, that it should not exploit its natural resources.

He rejected claims made by the charity that a road due to be built to allow for the company's plans could encourage hunting and poaching.

He the firm aims to reduce the risk by creating jobs for local people, who might otherwise be tempted to kill rare animals for commerical gain.

He told the paper Soco had invited Friel and WWF to visit Block V to see for themselves the poverty of the area.
