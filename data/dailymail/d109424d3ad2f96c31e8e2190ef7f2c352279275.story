A ski resort has issued the University of Michigan with a bill for half a million dollars after six fraternities and sororities staged a huge party that tore apart the hotel in an Animal House-style melee.

Originally, it was estimated the college students caused around $75,000 damage at Treetops Resort during a ski trip in January. 

But a full assessment of the 45 rooms and connecting hallway - which was stripped of its ceiling - plus the loss of revenue, and damage to the brand's reputation has seen that figure multiply by six.

And according to Barry Owens, general manager of Treetops in Gaylord, the fraternity that originally apologized for the damage - Sigma Alpha Mu - is refusing to pay up.

Wrecked: The Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity and Sigma Delta Tau sorority are being accused of causing $50,000 in damage to the Treetops Resort in Gaylord, Michigan earlier this month

Destroyed: It has since been revealed that another disastrous party happened at another ski resort about an hour away, involving four other fraternities and sororities from the University of Michigan. However the Boyne Highlands resort is not revealing pictures of the damage.

Legal action: It's estimated that both parties resulted in a combined $75,000 worth of damage. Both resorts are looking into pressing charges  

Owens told MLive: 'The destruction done to Treetops Resort by University of Michigan fraternity and sorority students in mid-January is now near or beyond $430,000. 

'While an investigation is ongoing, the university has stated that they expect the students who are responsible to make full restitution to Treetops for the damages.

'It also has become evident that the fraternity representatives have suggested that they are unwilling to pay for the damage that they caused the resort.'

He also called on Sigma Delta Tau to contribute to the payment, which includes cleaning fees. 

Shocking pictures of a ski resort wrecked by members of a University of Michigan fraternity earlier this month are only half the story. 

It turns out, members of several other Greek life organizations from the Ann Arbor, Michigan school held a similarly debauched rager at a another hotel that same weekend.

Combined, the damage done to Boyne Highlands resort from January 16 -18 is also estimated to be worth tens of thousands.

Since then, the six fraternities and sororities implicated in the two parties have been suspended by their national organizations while the university and police investigate the incidents.

Punishment: All of the fraternities and sororities implicated in the parties have been put on suspension by their national organizations which means they won't be allowed to host parties or represent their groups on campus

Historic: Barry Owens, the manager of the Treetops Resort, says the 45 rooms be rented to the groups were left in 'the worst condition' he's ever seen in his 30 years in hospitality

Sigma Alpha Mu chapter President Joshua Kaplan previously said his members 'are embarrassed and ashamed of the behavior' of some members.

He said that his fraternity 'accepts full responsibility' and 'will be working with the management of the resort to pay for all damages and cleaning costs'.

'This behavior is inconsistent with the values, policies, and practices of this organization,' Kaplan said.

'We will work within our own organization and with university officials to hold those who are responsible accountable for their actions.'

Similar charges may also be brought up by the Boyne Highlands Resort here members of Pi Kappa Alpha and Chi Psi fraternities held another party that same weekend in conjunction with the Delta Gamma and Alpha Phi sororities. 

Resorts spokesman Erin Ernst said that the group booked rooms in two blocks, and caused an estimated $25,000 in damage by breaking furniture and doors, soiling carpet and upholstery, punching holes in walls and smoking in non-smoking room. 

Ernst said they are not releasing images of the damage, since the management company does not own the building and publishing the pictures would be a violation of their landlord's privacy.

A spokesman for Boyne Highlands says one block of rooms was more destroyed than the other. Above, the Pi Kappa Alpha and Chi Psi fraternity houses at University of Michigan 

Chi Psi and Pi Kappa Alpha allegedly rented out two blocks of rooms at Boyne Highlands with members of the Delta Gamma (left) and Alpha Phi (right) sororites 

'One of the group's units was far worse than the other,' Ernst told The Ann Arbor News. 'Obviously our owners are not pleased. Showing this level of extreme disregard to our properties is ridiculous. We will be looking at implementing new policies when it comes to young people booking at our properties.'

In addition to possible criminal charges, Ernst says they will be looking into getting payment for the time they couldn't rent out the damaged condos.   

It's believed that members of even more University of Michigan fraternities and sororities may have been involved in both parties.

Suspension by their national organization means the members of the six fraternities and sororities involved may continue to live in their campuses houses but can not participate in social activities, including holding parties or representing their organizations at university functions .They also won't be able to vote in Greek life councils. 

University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald says the suspension gives the university and authorities time to investigate the incident and determine appropriate action. 

'It's more important to make sure we get the right information and move forward following our established processes than to do it by a specific deadline,' Mr Fitzgerald said.

The university community has expressed scorn at the way the fraternity and sorority members represented their institution - ranked one of the top public colleges in the nation - during the out-of-control weekend ski trip.

'These incidents simply do not reflect the University of Michigan's values or its expectations,' said E. Royster Harper, vice president for student life. 'The behaviors are a contradiction of what it means to be in and of a community, and we do not believe that being away from campus is a license to act in destructive and irresponsible ways.' 

Three student body leaders also reacted to the incident this week. The joint letter from Student body president Bobby Dishell, Interfraternity Council president Alex Krupiak and Panhellenic Association president Maddy Walsh wrote that the parties were 'an act of shocking disrespect'.

'We, as leaders and Greeks at the University of Michigan, do not tolerate these kinds of acts, nor do we let such behavior fall under the radar. We intend to handle this situation with the utmost efficiency, and we will ensure that those responsible for the damage to the properties will be held accountable throughout this process,' the statement reads.
