Princes William and Harry are both fierce competitors on the polo field, but even when they win Wills heads straight home to his family, while Harry's up for a celebratory drink.

That's according to Alec White, one of three Aussie cousins on the international polo circuit, who now counts the princes as mates after saddling up with the royal pair and helping them to victory at a competition at Ascot this year.

‘Harry makes fun of Will by telling him that he's whipped!' Alec told Daily Mail Australia.

‘Will had to go home to Kate and George, but Harry was very keen to hang around for drinks at the function afterwards.’

Alec, 24, and his cousins Jasper, 22, and Will, 25, from Scone in the horse-breeding country in New South Wales' Hunter Valley region, are known as 'The Three Whites' on the world professional polo circuit. 

They now spend around six months a year overseas competing, including a stint with the princes in their Audi Quattro team at the Audi Polo Challenge at Ascott in June.

‘They’re great guys, so down to earth. They remember everyone’s names and ask questions to get to know you properly,' Alec said.

He said both princes are very good players - for the amount they play, which they admitted was not as much as they would like.

‘I would say Harry’s a bit more fierce. Will played well but Harry was definitely better,' Alec said.

'Harry gets right in there and is pretty fearless when he plays, just like his personality.

'They say they love polo but can’t play as much as they’d like. They’re very sporty.'

The princes’ team won 5-4 in the last few minutes of their game, with the event attended by a host of England celebrities including Dame Helen Mirren and Clive Owen.

Alec couldn’t believe  the brothers, who introduced themselves casually as ‘Will and Harry’, were so normal.

Alec Brown is a professional polo player, living in England and Argentina for six months of the year. He grew up on his family property in NSW's upper Hunter Valley, with his grandparents and parents breeding and training polo horses 

‘I didn’t expect them to be the same as anyone else.

'My mouth was open most of the time. I was really nervous and I didn’t know what to ask them at first!'’

Alec says that the Duke of Cambridge was particularly interested in Alec’s Australian background.

‘Will said that he loved his time in Australia but was so flat out. He said he wishes he’d had more time to relax and take it in.

'Will said hopefully he can get back to Australia soon. He also spoke about George about how much he’s loving his Dad role.’

Alec said his  encounter with the princes was ‘a matter of right place, right time.’

‘I was playing that day and my friend got injured,' he said.

‘He’s an English player who represents England. He asked me to replace him for his afternoon game with Will and Harry so of course I did it!'

Despite his incredible experiences overseas, Alec cherishes the time he gets to return to the family property in Scone, in the upper Hunter Valley north of Sydney.

Alec spending four months of the year in England and two in Argentina playing polo.

‘It’s so good to get home after the long English season and to play in the local comp down in Scone,' he said.

‘It’s great to be back where it all started. Spending six months of the year living out of suitcases might seem like an amazing lifestyle but it is a job and you do miss home and your family and friends.’

Alec, Will and Jasper come from a family property, Belltrees, which breeds polo horses, as the boys come from a long line of polo enthusiasts.

The ‘Three Whites’ say the Scone local junior polo school is where their passion for polo began.

They are returning to compete in Scone's 'Polo in the Paddock' competition in a couple of weeks, to be held on their home turf in the Upper Hunter Valley country town, which is expected to be a great weekend attended by players and spectators.

It's a rare opportunity for the three cousins to play on the same team.

‘We all went our different ways and worked for different people so we’re always playing against each other, which is not so much fun,' Alec said.

‘We only get to play with each other when we come back to Scone.’

Although Alec has always loved the sport, he only entertained the thought of pursuing polo professionally during his gap year. 

He spent the year at Belltrees, after finishing boarding school at The King’s School in Sydney.

‘I really got the polo bug when I was about 19 though during my year at home.

‘I decided to go overseas to England when I was 20 and have been going back and forth for four years.’

Alec says it’s a ‘massive help’ to have his cousins playing polo in England alongside him.

‘I’ve lived with Will this year in England and it was amazing to have that support. Someone close you can rely on and who know what you’re going through.

'We’re under a lot of pressure to perform so it’s great to have someone there who you can ask for opinions.'

‘Grandma is literally the driving force of our whole family, she’s amazing. She lives at the Belltrees homestead herself but brings the whole family together. 

'The family breeds polo horses... The plan is to see how far I can get competing, and then come home to breed and train high-level polo horses.'

Alec thinks the Australian countryside is incredibly beautiful and the cliche is true - there's no place like home.

'I’m lucky to have played at most clubs in the world but there aren’t many that have such a great atmosphere.

'The Scone Polo Club has the traditional country vibe where people come together who love the sport, love horses and have a good weekend and a good experience.'

He's looking forward to seeing the princes again when he returns to England - particularly party boy Harry.

'I’ll definitely see them again. I had a really good time with them and it was an amazing opportunity to play with them.

'I’d love to have a drink with Harry again!'
