Nick Clegg today challenged the Tories come clean about where the axe will fall, just 24 hours after the coalition ended.

The Lib Dem leader accused David Cameron and George Osborne of 'trying to pull the wool over your eyes' by promising to protect the NHS without spelling out how he will pay for it.

He said that only the Lib Dems have promised to find the £8billion which NHS chiefs say will be needed by 2020, and how the money will be found.

Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England, has warned that by the end of the decade the health service will need an extra £8billion-a-year.

Mr Clegg boasted that he would ensure the NHS got the money, but he said Labour had not made that pledge and the Tories 'try to give the impression they have, but they haven't'. 

At an election campaign press conference at the National Liberal Club in central London he said: 'We know the Conservatives won't ask the wealthiest to pay a penny more so every spending commitment they make has to be met by deeper and deeper cuts elsewhere.

'So, George Osborne, Jeremy Hunt - where will the axe fall? Soldiers, schools social workers? The only people the Tories have said they will protect are their friends in big business and in big houses.

'The Conservatives are trying to pull the wool over your eyes by not telling you how they will give the NHS the resources it needs.'

Mr Clegg added: 'The dividing lines of this election are becoming clearer by the day. The Conservatives will cut too much, Labour will borrow too much. Excessive cuts or excessive borrowing. It's a dismal choice.

'What you want is a balanced budget and stronger public services. That's what the Liberal Democrats offer.' 

The Lib Dems were the first to publicly commit to providing 'in full' the extra £8 billion a year the NHS boss says it needs by 2020. 

The party promises to repeat the £2 billion annual 'down payment' announced by Mr Osborne each year to 2020 and add £1 billion from a tax squeeze on high earners and ending the Conservative 'shares for rights' policy.

But the bulk of the extra is slated to come from increasing public spending in line with economic growth after eliminating the structural deficit in 2017-18.

Mr Clegg used a press conference at the National Liberal Club to claim only the Lib Dems have spelt out how to fund £8billion extra for the NHS

Mr Clegg said the Liberal Democrats would be 'pretty specific' about exactly where the party's preferred tax rises would hit by the time voters go to the polls

The Lib Dems today pledged an extra £2.5billion for mental health care to end 'decades of institutionalised discrimination' in the NHS. 

Nick Clegg said his party had proved they were serious about the issue by campaigning 'remorselessly' in government for improved services, with some success. 

Some £250 million over five years will be spent on services for pregnant women and mothers dealing with depression.

This would include eight new mother and baby units providing inpatient care and 40 new community services helping new mothers adjust to life at home with a newborn.

New waiting time standards will be introduced for people in crisis and for conditions like bipolar disorder so that those who are ill know how long they have to wait.

The funding would also mean hundreds of thousands more people will get access to talking therapies for anxiety and depression.

A commitment to boost funding for health, with a particular focus on mental health, will be on the front page of the Lib Dem election manifesto, indicating it will be a key priority in any coalition talks after the General Election. 

Felicity Dormon, senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation charity, said well-targeted extra funding for mental health could improve the quality of NHS care but questioned what other areas of health would lose cash as a result.

However, this raises questions about what happens if the economy does not grow as rapidly as hoped.

Mr Clegg said it was 'perfectly legitimate' to base policy on current projections.

'You can only operate on a set of assumptions. That's what any economist does. Since I can't tell you precisely in the future what is going to happen, I can tell you that we base our plans on the predictions that are given independently by the Office of Budget Responsibility,' he said.

Asked what the plan would be if growth was slower, he said: 'Well, what do I do if the world comes to an end next Tuesday?

'The greatest threat to ongoing growth in the British economy is that we don't continue the balanced approach to fiscal consolidation and maintain the stability which has led to far greater growth than many predicted.'

Mr Clegg went on: 'Ed Miliband, David Cameron, it's time to come clean: will you or will you not give the NHS the £8 billion a year by 2020 that it needs and tell us how you plan to fund it?

'The Liberal Democrats have. If you care about the NHS as much as you claim to, you should too.' 

Mr Clegg said the Liberal Democrats would be 'pretty specific' about exactly where the party's preferred tax rises would fall by the time voters go to the polls.

It says £6 billion of the cost of balancing the books should come from increased tax - with the same sum found from a clampdown on tax dodgers, £12 billion in Whitehall cuts and around £3.5 from a squeeze on welfare.

'I accept the challenge that we should show how that £6 billion is arrived at in additional taxes but I think we have already provided far more detail than any other party in the early stages of this election campaign,' Mr Clegg said. 'On taxes we will be pretty specific.'
