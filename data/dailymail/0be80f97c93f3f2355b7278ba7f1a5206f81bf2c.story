Nick Clegg has admitted he would happily serve as Boris Johnson’s deputy in any future coalition.

The Liberal Democrat leader has also said he wants his party to remain in government after the 2015 general election – whether it be in partnership with Labour or the Conservatives.

Mr Clegg said he believes coalitions are ‘here to stay’ as the grip of the two main parties slackens and UKIP wins more support.

‘I want the Liberal Democrats to be in government,’ he said.

‘I can’t predict which combination, whether it be the Conservatives or Labour, but I think both for myself individually,
personally, and the party, that we’re good at governing now - we are 
good at governing from the liberal centre ground.

'We fight tenaciously where we think there’s a danger of the Government lurching off in the wrong direction.’

Asked whether he would be prepared to serve under the present Mayor of London if he ever became Tory prime minister, Mr Clegg told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘Yes, of course.

‘I want my party to punch above its weight, and indeed we do.’

Last week Mr Clegg and Mr Johnson 
clashed after the London mayor made controversial comments on the 
subject of IQ, suggesting that much of the ‘species’ are too stupid to 
ever get on in life.

But the Deputy Prime Minister said he would be prepared to work under him.

Mr Clegg said his party would be happy to work with Labour, but it would need a more mature approach on the economy - such as an insistence that the deficit is eliminated.

‘What I was trying to do, beyond the individual measures, was say to Labour: “Look, we may have our differences, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, but we both agree that you have to clear the decks by 2018. What’s your point of view?”.’

It comes amid reports that Mr Clegg is preparing to unleash a wave of speeches distancing himself from David Cameron and the Tories.

A party source said yesterday that the Lib Dems could soon start to indulge in ‘gentle flirting’ with Labour.

Danny Alexander said the Conservatives could not 'be trusted to deliver fairness in this country'

‘We’ll be seeing a growing number of speeches highlighting our differences,’ said the insider. ‘We’ve said a lot about what we have achieved in Coalition. From now on we’ll be focusing on what we could do apart.’

The Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the Lib Dems and Tories were different.

‘I’d say that there are big differences between our parties; we want to have both a strong economy and a fair society, we think that you need the Liberal Democrats to keep the country in the centre-ground so you can have both,’ he said.

‘Labour, as we saw this week from Ed Balls, couldn’t deliver a stronger economy, that’s why no on trusts them on the economy. But I don’t think the Conservatives by themselves could be trusted to deliver fairness in this country either.’
