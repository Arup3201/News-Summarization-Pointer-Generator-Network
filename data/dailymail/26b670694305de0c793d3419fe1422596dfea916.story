An inmate in a New York jail costs just as much as four years' tuition at an Ivy League college according to a new report.

The city's annual cost per inmate was $167,731 last year or $460 per day.

The Department of Corrections (DOC) blames much of the expense on the running costs of the city's most notorious lockup, Rikers Island which is literally an island unto itself.

Expensive inmates: Inmates file out of the prison bakery at Rikers Island, the notorious jail blamed for New York City's high annual inmate costs. Last year they spent $167,731 ($460 per day) on each inmate

Martin Horn, who in 2009 resigned as the city's correction commissioner, noted that hundreds of millions of dollars are spent a year to run the 400-acre island in the East River next to the runways of LaGuardia Airport that has 10 jail facilities, thousands of staff and its own power plant and bakery.

He said: 'Other cities don't have Rikers Island.'

The city's Independent Budget Office annual figure of $167,731 - which equates to about $460 per day for the 12,287 average daily New York City inmates last year - was based on about $2 billion in total operating expenses for the DOC, which included salaries and benefits for staff, judgments and claims as well as debt service for jail construction and repairs.

But there are particularly expensive costs associated with Rikers.

The
 department says it spends $30.3 million annually alone on 
transportation costs, running three bus services that usher inmates to 
and from court throughout the five boroughs, staff from a central 
parking lot to Rikers jails and visitors to and around the island. 

There were 261,158 inmates delivered to court last year.

A
 way to bring down the costs, Horn has long said, would be to replace 
Rikers Island with more robust jails next door to courthouses. But his 
attempts to do that failed in part because of political opposition from 
residential areas near courthouses in Brooklyn, Manhattan and elsewhere.

He said of the budget figure: ‘My 
point is: Have you seen a whole lot of outcry on this? Why doesn't 
anything happen? Because nobody cares.’

‘That's the reason we have Rikers Island. We want these guys put away out of public view.’

New York's annual costs dwarf the 
annual per-inmate costs in other big cities. Los Angeles spent $128.94 a
 day, or $47,063 a year, for 17,400 inmates in fiscal year 2011-12, its 
sheriff's office said.

Chicago
 spent $145 a day, or $52,925 a year, for 13,200 inmates in 2010, the 
most recent figures available from that county's sheriff's office. Those
 costs included debt-service and fringe benefits.Experts
 note that New York's high annual price tag is deceiving because it 
reflects considerable pensions and salary responsibilities, debt service
 and the expensive fixed costs. 

The DOC says 86 per cent of its operating costs go for staff wages.

New
 York's system differs from other cities in some other costly ways - it 
employs 9,000 relatively well-paid, unionised correction officers, for 
example, and is required by law to provide certain services to inmates, 
including high quality medical care within 24 hours of incarceration.

Nick
 Freudenberg, a public health professor at Hunter College, said the 
latest city figures show that declining incarceration rates have not 
translated into cost savings.

In
 2001, when the city had 14,490 inmates, the full cost of incarcerating 
one inmate at Rikers Island for a year was $92,500, or about $122,155 
adjusted for today's dollars - that means the city spent $45,576 more in
 2012 than it did 11 years ago.

No worries: Martin Horn, who in 2009 resigned as the city's correction commissioner, says that so much money is spent on the 400-acre jail because 'nobody cares'

Prof Freudenberg said: ‘To my mind, the main policy question is: How could we be spending this money better? What would be a better return on that investment?’

Another contributing factor to the inmate price tag is the length of stay for prisoners in New York's criminal justice system. 

Some inmates have waited years in city jails to see trial. The DOC said in 2012 that the average length of stay for detainees was 53 days and 38.6 days for sentenced inmates.

Michael Jacobson, a former commissioner of the city's Department of Correction and probation who serves as director of the CUNY Institute for State and Local Governance, said: ‘Not only is that a miscarriage of justice, it affects your operations. 

‘You want to save big money? Take a quarter out just by improving the process they go through when they're in the system.’
