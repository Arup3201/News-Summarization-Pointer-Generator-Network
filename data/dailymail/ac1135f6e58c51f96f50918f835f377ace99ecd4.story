A furious mother has hit out after her fit and active five-year-old son was branded 'overweight' in a letter he brought home from school.

Jayden Timmermans weighs less than 4st and enjoys swimming, cycling and trampolining.

But the 'patronising' letter to his parents claimed he was too heavy - and came with an enclosed leaflet on how to lead a healthy lifestyle.

Samantha Timmermans, right, received a letter from her son Jayden's school warning that the five-year-old who loves swimming and riding his bicycle was 'overweight'

Jayden's mother, Samantha Timmermans, said: 'It is a complete load of rubbish.

'Jayden is just a normal little boy. He is quite tall and broad for his age, but he is in proportion.

'When we take him swimming you can see his ribcage. He is very active - he walks home from school, he goes out on his trampoline and rides his bike.

'We have a healthy lifestyle and set him a good example. When I go out running he will come with me on his bike for a couple of miles.

'He would happily eat a stick of carrot over a bit of chocolate, but there is nothing wrong with having a treat now and again.

"'It is very patronising to be told your child is overweight in this way.'

Jayden's school used the Body Mass Index to determine that the five year old was was too heavy for a boy of his age

The youngster from Fernwood, Notts is 3ft 9 inches tall and weighs 3st 10lbs.

But according to height and weight measurements taken as part of the National Child Measurement Programme, used to calculate a body mass index (BMI) score, he is overweight for his age and sex.

Mrs Timmermans said she was concerned the programme could put pressure on young children to start dieting.

Jayden brought the Notts County Council letter home from Chuter Ede Primary School in Balderton, Notts.

It read: 'The results suggest your child is overweight for their age, sex and height. If your child is overweight now, they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an adult. This can lead to health problems.

'You and Jayden can make simple changes to be more active and eat more healthily.'

A Change 4 Life leaflet was enclosed with the letter, which also advised Mrs Timmermans to contact a patient advice and liaison service (PALS).

It did not say by how much Jayden was supposedly overweight, or what his BMI score was.

Mrs Timmermans added: 'There is so much pressure on adults to be thin, never mind children, and it is not fair to make children think they are overweight.

'Children are still growing and BMI does not take into account growth spurts. Some children have puppy fat before shooting up.

'Common sense tells me Jayden is not fat, but some parents may worry their children need to lose weight.

'That puts pressure on them and you don't want children exposed to dieting at that age.'

According to Jayden's mother Samatha, the youngster would prefer eating a carrot slice to a chocolate bar and is very active

The Body Mass Index is used to measure their amount of body fat a person is carrying.

Medics use a modified BMI scale with children that takes account of their age and sex.

One in three children in Britain is classed as 'overweight' according to official government figures. 

Children are classed as either underweight, healthy weight, overweight or very overweight.

According the National Childhood Measurement Programme: 'It can be difficult to tell if your child is overweight as they may look similar to other children of their age. That’s why we use the measurement of weight against height to get an accurate measure.'Research shows that if your child is overweight now, they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an adult. This can lead to health problems in later life, so this measurement is an important way of checking how your child is growing.'

Anne Pridgeon, a senior public health manager at Notts County Council, said the measurement programme was an important way of monitoring how many children in the county were overweight, and ensuring the right public health approach was taken.

She added: 'If we can help ensure our children maintain a healthy weight, evidence shows they will have less weight-related health issues later in life.

'The measurement programme can act as an early warning to flag to parents there may a developing issue that can be addressed.'

The programme was introduced to help tackle child obesity.

Under the national scheme all four and five-year-olds and children aged 10 to 11 have their height and weight measured to create a national childhood obesity database.

However, there has been some criticism of using BMI to determine whether someone was overweight or not.

At 5ft 10 and weighing 14 stone 9, former British and Irish Lion captain Brian O'Driscoll has a BMI of 29.3 and is classed as overweight.

Overweight? Brian O'Driscoll has a BMI of 29.3 and according to NHS guidelines the former British and Ireland Lions captain is officially overweight
