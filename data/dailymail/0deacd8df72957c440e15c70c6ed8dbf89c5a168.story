'Harold was the glue man. There wouldn’t have been a Ghostbusters without Harold. He pulled it together. I know I probably wouldn’t be in the business had I not had the chance to work with Harold at that time of my career. He taught me a lot, not overtly trying to teach me, just by example, watching him work and how he dealt with things.’

The
 Chicago native died from complications of autoimmune inflammatory 
vasculitis – which swells the blood vessels - surrounded by family just 
before 1.00am, his wife Erica told the Chicago Tribune.

Ramis’
 health began going downhill in 2010 when complications of the 
autoimmune disease arose from an infection. The condition was so severe 
he had to learn how to walk all over again, a family spokesperson told 
the paper.

He never fully recovered, and finally lost his battle with the disease.

The beloved filmmaker was known for his over the top comedies with an uncommon touch.

His
 off-beat, but cerebral and self-aware characters brought tears of 
laughter and sadness to millions. His movies are the soundtrack to many 
childhoods that eventually grew into happy hours.

Ramis'
 first major film was the raucous 1978 John Belushi comedy 'Animal 
House,' which made the latter a household name and still inspires jokes 
among college students decades later.

Belushi was one of three future 
Hollywood stars Ramis worked with in the 1970's at Second City - Bill 
Murray and Dan Akroyd were also lighting rooms up with their humor as 
Ramis played the willing straight man.

'I stopped being the zany... I learned that my thing was lobbing in great lines here and there, which would score big and keep me there on the stage,' Ramis told the Tribune years ago.

That theme continued for the rest of his acting career, as he spent it either writing the punchlines for others, directing or playing the straight man.

His first acting role came in 'Stripes,' a movie he wrote for Murray. But he shot to stardom starring as the geeky, science-obsessed Dr. Egon Spengler in both 'Ghostbusters' movies.

Ramis never had more than bit parts after his run as Spengler was through, but his film writing legacy spans generations.

He wrote and directed 1980's 'Caddyshack,' cementing both he and Mrray's place in Hollywood. They would make several more films together.

'In 1993 Harold Ramis called me & told me his 2 rules of directing comedy: '1. Hire Bill Murray 2. Turn on camera,' filmmaker Dan Mirvish tweeted upon hearing of Ramis' death.

Ramis' seemingly struck gold with every film script he churned out, from 'Meatballs' to 'National Lampoon's Vacation,' which launched a string of sequels and Chevy Chase's film career.

The parade of hits continued with 'Caddyshack 2,' the critically acclaimed 'Groundhog Day,' 'Analyze This' and sequel 'Analyze That.'

His last acting role came as the 
father to Seth Rogen's character in 2009's 'Knocked Up.' Rogen has often
 said Ramis is one of the reasons he began doing comedy.

'His
 work is the reason why so many of us got into comedy,' 'Knocked Up' 
director Judd Apatow told the Tribune. 'We grew up on 'Second City TV' 
and 'Ghostbusters,' 'Vacation,' 'Animal House,' 'Stripes,' 'Meatballs,' 
he literally made every single one of our favorite movies.'
