A veteran police officer who was sacked last year after firing shots at a minivan filled with children said his 'heart sank' when he realized there were kids inside.

Dramatic dash cam video revealed the moment that Elias Montoya, 53, fired three shots at the vehicle carrying a mother and her five children, aged six to 16, after a traffic stop spiraled out of control in Taos, New Mexico last October.

Speaking out for the first time since the incident, Montoya, himself a father of three, told ABC News that tinted windows in the van kept him from seeing the children inside.

'My heart sank when they finally stopped and I was at the passenger side at that time seeing them get out at gunpoint again,' he said. 'I couldn't believe it that there were that many children in there.'

Remorse: Elias Montoya was fired last month for shooting at a minivan filled with children after a traffic stop spun out of control. He has now spoken out to say he did not know there were children inside

He added: 'If I knew that there was even one child in that vehicle, I wouldn't have done it.'

Montoya, who is appealing his department's decision to fire him, insisted that it was the first time he had fired his gun on duty during his 12 years on the force.

The
 motorist, 39-year-old Oriana Farrell, had been stopped by another State
 Police officer for speeding. She had fled twice after the officer tried to
 give her a ticket and then arrest her.

When she was stopped for the second time, she refused to get out of the van and when she finally agreed, she jumped back inside as an officer attempted to restrain her.

Her 14-year-old son could be seen on the video confronting the officer, leading to a scuffle, and he only stopped when the cop pulled out a Taser.

Montoya then arrived as part of back up, and the woman and her children had locked themselves inside the vehicle. Montoya said he had only been told to respond to an 'unruly vehicle' and did not know children were inside.

Battle: It came after authorities pulled over the driver, Oriana Farrell, for speeding - but she and her teenage son resisted officers, as caught on dashcam above. Montoya was called as part of backup

'I'm approaching the van on the 
left-hand side,' he recounted. 'All I see is silhouettes of heads. A 
bunch of silhouettes of heads and what went through my mind is that 
we're outnumbered.'

When the woman tried to flee for the second time, he shot at the van's tire as she drove away.

'I'm not shooting at a human being. I'm shooting at a tire,' Montoya said.

He
 missed the tire and the driver continued, leading to a high speed 
chase. Eventually Farrell and her teenage son were arrested.

Farrell
 faces charges of child abuse, fleeing and misdemeanor possession of 
drug paraphernalia for marijuana pipes allegedly found in the van.

Family: Montoya, pictured seated left, said he never would have shot if he knew kids were inside

But she has insisted that she drove off because she was protecting her children.

Ms Farrell, who refers to herself as a 'model parent,' is due to appear in court in April.

Montoya
 later bought the entire family food from McDonald's during the booking 
process, according to a police report, ABC reported.

The officer was placed on administrative following an investigation into the shooting.

A Facebook page called 'I support Officer
 Elias Montoya' sprung up following the news of his termination and has 
been 'liked' nearly 6,000 times.

Police
 chief KassetasÂ  would not comment on the issue, other than to say, 'I'm
 the chief. I take ownership of it. The buck stops here, so to speak.'
