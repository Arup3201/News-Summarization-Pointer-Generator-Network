Paramedics were called to Lane Cove around 1.20pm following reports of a massive explosion that sent flames roaring metres into the sky.

Fire ball: An gas main explosion in the Lane Cove CBD on Monday afternoon caused fire to leap many metres into the sky as a man was taken to hospital with serious burns

At least six fire fighting crews were on handÂ  at the site of the explosion, which occurred next to a shopping centre in the Lane Cove CBD.

The explosion caused a significant fire which was still burning more than an hour after the blast.

Witnesses reported fireballs leaping 10-15 metres into the air, while there were reports of more than 100 people being evacuated.

Twitter user Karen Austin described the situation as 'absolute chaos', while Ben Leffler wrote: 'A five metre pillar of fire erupting from the ground in the centre of Lane Cove. Ogalos evacuated. I repeat Ogalos evacuated. Worst day ever'.

The explosion forced the closure of Longueville Road in both directions as emergency services battled to bring the ensuing blaze under control.

The main gas fire was extinguished around 2.20am, however secondary flames were still burning on adjacent buildings.

It is unclear if the excavator operator was responsible for rupturing the gas main.
