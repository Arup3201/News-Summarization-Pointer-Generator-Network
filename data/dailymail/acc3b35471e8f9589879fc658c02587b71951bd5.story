DOWNTON'S EXIT

We were told by Mooresey [coach Peter Moores] that Paul had been let go between sessions in the practice game against Saint Kitts. I think Mooresey had only just found out himself. You see it when football clubs get taken over; you tend to see different people brought in for key positions. Paul was a lovely guy and I feel sorry he’s lost his job but when you get new people in, changes always happen.

There have been a few names bandied around and I think Straussy [Andrew Strauss] was considered last time the role came up a year ago, but he didn’t particularly fancy it. He’s certainly a very good man, but it’s hard to know who would be a good candidate until we know more about what the job role is. But Strauss, Michael Vaughan and Alec Stewart are all former England captains who would all bring their own experience and knowledge to the role.

ALASTAIR COOK

He seems in a really happy place and excited to be back around the group. He’d be the last person to make too much of a fuss about a hundred in a warm-up game but I’d back him to score big runs in this series — he looks refreshed and ready to go.

PLAYER POWER

It’s incredibly important that all the players feel they can contribute and speak up when they need to. That can be quite a scary thing but you only get better as a group when you do that. I did an Adidas event with Harlequins winger Ugo Monye and he was saying how player-led they were at the club. During the World Cup we didn’t talk enough as players and the guys weren’t speaking up as much as they needed to. We needed more edge and hopefully bringing guys like Cooky and Trotty [Jonathan Trott] back into the group will help that.

RICHIE BENAUD

I used to watch videos of my dad playing in the 1986-87 Ashes series and I’ll always remember Richie’s commentary on that. He had this way of sounding as if he was reciting commentary when he was commentating and making it relaxing and peaceful to listen to. I don’t think there’ll be anyone in the cricket world who won’t be touched by his passing. His voice symbolised cricket and we’ll all miss him.

JIMMY ANDERSON

He’s one of my best mates and we’ve played a lot of cricket together. He’s taught me a huge amount and guided me through my international career. I think we’re third behind Waqar [Younis] and Wasim [Akram] and Curtly [Ambrose] and Courtney [Walsh] as a pairing and that comes from us complementing each other’s styles and constant communication. It would a phenomenal achievement for him to become England’s leading wicket taker.

FITNESS

Twisting my ankle in the warm-up game was a bit of a scare, but it feels fine now. There was a burning feeling for a minute or so after it happened and I was pretty worried. It’s still bit stiff in the morning but fingers crossed it will be OK.

ANTIGUA TRACK

They’re generally pretty flat out here now and I think fans can expect some fairly attritional cricket for the first few days before things speed up a bit. We’ve been practising our slip catching low down by our ankles because we’re not expecting a lot of carry. I think the team that wins the series will be the one that shows most patience and gets the best out of reverse swing.
