Juventus have made an offer to sign Diego de Girolamo from Sheffield United.

The 19-year-old Chesterfield-born striker, who qualifies for Italy as his father Cozimo hails from Naples, is out of contract in the summer and is being courted by several clubs.

He has impressed Juventus scouts playing for Italy at U18 and U20 level and Juve club officials held talks with his representatives in London on Friday.

De Girolamo is on loan at League Two York City but is out of action after contracting food poisoning while on international duty with Italy U20s last week.

Southampton, Sunderland and Celtic have also expressed an interest in the young forward who has scored five goals in 16 appearances this season.

Juventus would be able to sign him for a compensation fee of around £300,000 while a move to an English club could net Sheffield United closer to £1million at a tribunal.
