President Barack Obama's top military adviser said Sunday that while he hasn't seen the need for ground troops in Iraq so far, there's a strong chance combat troops will be needed to fight the Islamic State in the future.

'Yeah, there will be circumstances when the answer to that question will likely be yes,' Gen. Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview with ABC that aired on This Week. 

'But I haven't encountered one right now,' he added.

Dempsey's interview aired on the same day Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned that Islamic radicals are perilously close to taking a key city along Syria's border with Turkey.

Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC that there may be 'circumstances' in the future when ground troops will be needed in Iraq

The U.S. has launched more than two dozen airstrikes against ISIS in the Kobane region, and 'some progress made,' but the situation continues to be 'dangerous,' Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Sunday during a trip to Chile, according to BBC.

A Kobane official told Reuters that fighters on the ground do not have enough weapons. And 'without weaponry, is not going to make a critical difference,' he said.

A senior Kurdish official, Ismet Sheikh Hasan, told the Associated Press on Friday that airstrikes had not deterred ISIS and warned that a massacre would occur if the international community did not step in.

He also urged Turkey to open a closed-off corridor to Kobane's remaining residents and to allow arms to flow through the country to Kurds fighting against ISIS just over the border.

Turkey has been unwilling to intervene in the violence taking place in the Syrian city, even after the U.S. State Department dispatched Gen. John Allen to the country last Thursday to plead for their help. Allen is coordinating the Obama administration's assault on ISIS.

The Syrian border state has long said its strategy would focus on taking out its neighboring country's corrupt president, Bashar al Assad, not Islamic radicals.

'The government is not going to budge on this,' a Turkish official told the Wall Street Journal on Friday.

'As long as you have Assad there, with his policies of dropping barrel bombs, chemical weapons, this vicious cycle is going to continue on and on with more groups, different groups, coming in.' 

The U.S. has also refused to engage ISIS militarily in Syria, even as it has acknowledged the limitations of it's airstrike campaign.

Gen. Dempsey confirmed Sunday that it is becoming more and more difficult for the U.S. to identify suitable targets in Iraq and Syria to bomb as the war against ISIS rages on.

'An enemy adapts and they’ll be harder to target,' Dempsey said. 'They know how to maneuver and how to use populations and concealment.' 

In a portion of the interview that aired earlier in the week, Dempsey told ABC News' Martha Raddatz that ISIS is 'becoming more savvy with the use of electronic devices.'

'They don't fly flags and move around in large convoys the way they did. ... They don't establish headquarters that are visible or identifiable.'

The four-star general did not specifically advocate for the use of U.S. combat forces in the battle against ISIS, but he's said in the past that he would make that recommendation if push came to shove.

A circumstance that could call for U.S. military involvement on the ground, for example, would be a mission to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul, Dempsey told a Senate committee last month, speaking hypothetically.

National Security Adviser Susan Rice told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd yesterday that up to this point, however, 'there has been no recommendation' by 'military commanders, either on the ground, nor here in Washington, that the United States put any ground combat forces into Iraq.

'That has not come up the chain to anybody at the White House. And I don't anticipate that it will,' she said, citing the president's promises that he would not send U.S. troops into Iraq to engage in combat.

'The president has been very plain that this is not a campaign that requires or even would benefit from American ground troops in combat again.'

President Barack Obama meets with military senior leadership to receive an update on the campaign to combat Islamic State last Wednesday. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, left, and Dempsey, right, sit next to the president. Hagel cautioned on Sunday that ISIS was dangerously close to taking control of Kobane, a Syrian city that's a stone's throw away from Turkey

Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Kobane this morning. An Islamic State suicide bomber detonated a truck laden with explosives on Monday in the besieged Kurdish town near the Turkish border crossing with Syria, a monitoring group and Kurdish sources said

The Obama administration official said the United States' previous involvement in Iraq serves as proof that the country will not be able to stave off terrorists like ISIS after the United States leaves if its citizens 'aren't willing and committed' to protecting their country. 

'It's not going to happen overnight. But if it isn't achieved, nothing is going to be sustainable,' she said.

'So people need to understand there are going to be good days, bad days, victories, and setbacks, as the Iraqis themselves take this fight to ISIL.' 

Rice threw her full support behind the president's strategy to eliminate ISIS  and encouraged Obama's critics to give him more breathing room.

'This is going to take time,' she said. 'It can't judged by merely what happens in one particular town or in one particular region. 

'The American people need to understand that our aim here is long-term degradation and building the capacity of our partners.'

Turkish soldiers hold their position on a tank as they keep an eye on Kobane on Monday. The strategic border town, located just a mile outside of Turkey, has been beseiged by Islamic State militants since mid-September

Meanwhile,  ISIS has inched closer and closer to taking control of Kobane, which is located less than a mile away from the country's border with Turkey.

The Islamic State is also making an aggressive play for the Baghdad airport in Iraq.

Republican Sen. John McCain, a member of the Senate's Armed Forces and Foreign Relations committees, said Sunday that he believes ISIS could capture the airport in Iraq's capitol city.

'They're winning, and we're not,' McCain said of ISIS on CNN's State of the Union. 'The Iraqis are not winning. The Peshmerga, the Kurds are not winning.

'There has to be a fundamental re-evaluation of what we're doing because we are not..."degrading and ultimately destroying ISIS" ' as the Obama administration has said it would, McCain said.

The former Republican presidential nominee said the U.S. needed to provide arms to both the Peshmerga and moderate rebels who are part of the Free Syrian Army. 

He also called on President Obama to expand his strategy against ISIS to include deposing al Assad.

'You have to go after ISIS and Bashar al Assad at the same time or you will not succeed,' he said. 

Former McCain adviser and business executive Carly Fiorina separately argued on Fox News Sunday that Obama has to follow through on his previous promise to hold Assad accountable for his actions.

Obama has said he wants Assad out, but he 'clearly doesn't believe,' Fiorina, a dark horse 2016 presidential candidate, charged. 

She further claimed that Obama 'never had a strategy in Syria' and 'there is no explanation' for the way he's inconsistent policies toward the country.

'Meanwhile, things continue to go from bad to worse,' she said, according to Politico.
