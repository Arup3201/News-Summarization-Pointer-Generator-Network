Car insurance company AAA is warning people against taking selfies while driving, saying ‘it can kill’.

This comes just a few days after the word ‘selfie’ was voted Oxford Dictionary’s 2013 word of the year.

The word beat tough competition from twerk, binge-watch and showrooming, as editors said the word has evolved from a niche social media tag into a mainstream term for a self-portrait photograph.

Selfies: Driving while taking a picture of yourself is not a good idea as it could end in a car accident

Car selfie: A girl posts a picture of herself on Twitter while in her car. The AAA says these acts are likely to cause an accident if the vehicle is in motion

But AAA officials in Salt Lake City, 
Utah, say the new phenomenon is distracting drivers as millions of 
people post them on social media.

Some
 drivers have admitted to doing it, according to Fox13, saying they do 
it usually when they are stopped at a light, not while moving.

AAA’s
 research shows taking a photo for two seconds while driving means your 
eyes are off the road for nearly half a football field.

‘Don’t let that driving selfie or video be the last photo you ever take,’ officials said.

Picture time! Leave the photo taking to your friends in the backseat who are not driving

With
 six-second videos popular on Vine and 15-second videos, the latest 
feature on Instagram, drivers are distracted for the distance of up to 
nearly four football fields.

‘You can certainly kill yourself as well as kill other people as well,’ said Rolayne Fairclough with AAA Utah.

Fairclough said it depends
 on the speed a person is traveling, but that five seconds is a 'great deal of 
distance especially if you’re in inclement weather or in traffic things 
can happen and you really need to be focused on the road'.

'Annoyed': This driver posts an Instagram photograph of himself on his way to work, saying the other drivers were getting on his nerves

Currently,
 Utah has a law against texting while driving.

Some other states have 
similar laws and also require hands-free devices while behind the wheel.

The
 frequency of the word selfie in the English language has increased by 
17,000 per cent since this time last year, according to research conducted by 
Oxford Dictionaries editors.
