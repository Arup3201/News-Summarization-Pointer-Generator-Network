An elderly man who has been on the run for 30 years was discovered by police after he refused to pass through an airport security scanner.

Clements Lopez was charged with sexually assaulting a girl on 6 May, 1985, but he failed to attend the trial and a $5000 reward was offered.

After evading police for three decades, the 86-year-old is being held in custody as his lawyers attempt to grant him bail, reports ABC.

After he refused to pass the security scanner, police led Mr Lopez aside and ran a security check on him, discovering a 30-year-old warrant for his arrest.

Mr Lopez's defence lawyer applied for bail, but Chief Justice Trevor Riley said the charges facing the defendant were too serious.

'He hasn't been heard from since 1986 and now I'm not just going to let him walk away again,' Mr Riley said.

Two witnesses who did not attend the original case are currently being sought by police.

The defence told the court Mr Lopez's two Queensland based sons have been contacted to provide assurance of his attendance to court should he receive bail.

The matter has been postponed until Friday, when a more substantial proposal for bail will be presented.
