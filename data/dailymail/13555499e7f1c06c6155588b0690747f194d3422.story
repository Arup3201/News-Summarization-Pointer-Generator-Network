Every bride wants to look perfect on their wedding day and it seems Angelina Jolie is no exception. But will she really go as far as to have surgery to remove bulging veins in her arms?

That's the claim made by U.S. magazine National Enquirer who report that the actress 'wants to look as beautiful as possible when she walks down the aisle this summer' to tie the knot with long-term partner Brad Pitt.

Angelina is regularly voted one of the most beautiful women in the world but an 'insider' told the magazine the Oscar-winner 'has always had a complex about how her veins jut out'. 

Bridal perfection: A U.S. tabloid states Angelina Jolie wants to be rid of the jutting veins in her arms ahead of her wedding to Brad Pitt

They said: 'She never had an incentive to do anything about it until now. She's
 chosen a sleeveless gown for her wedding day, and the last thing she 
wants is to be looking like a freak in the photographs.'

It's is unlikely there will be much chance of that when the 38 year old marries Brad, 50, with whom she has six children.

But the magazine claim she's so keen to 'tidy up' her appearance for the big day she will consider surgery.

The other option would be for the slim star to gain weight so the protruding veins were less obvious but the source said 'that’s not an option to her.'

According to an 'insider' the actress, pictured here with Brad Pitt and their son Maddox, has always had a 'complex' about her veiny arms and the wedding has finally given her an incentive to do something about it

'If she took the time to bulk up, everything in her life – including the toll all the weight loss has taken on her body – would fall into place. But Angie's just too busy to eat. She’s also convinced that she needs to stay super-skinny to maintain her sex appeal. That leaves her no option but surgery to tidy up those veins,' they said.

Endovenous laser treatment is frequently used to reduce the appearance of unsightly varicose veins.

A catheter is inserted into the troublesome vein and a laser is passed through that which then delivers short bursts of energy that heat up the vein and seal it closed. Blood no longer pumps through it and so it disappears.

What complex? Sceptics point out that If Angelina is so paranoid about her arms, why does she often wear sleeveless gowns on the red carpet?

Spire Healthcare offer the treatment in the UK on varicose veins in the leg for a 'guide price' of £1,765. They state the loss of the treated vein is not damaging because 'after treatment the blood in the faulty veins will be diverted to other normal veins in order to make its way back to the heart.'

Keith Rose a venous specialist at cosmetics surgery provider MYA.co.uk and Courthouse Clinics told MailOnline: 'Endovenous Laser Therapy is an established minimally invasive technique for the treatment of varicose veins in the lower limbs.

'Long term studies have shown that the results are as good as, or better than open surgery and the technique is recommended by NICE as the first choice for varicose veins in the leg.

'EVLA for veins in the arm is a novel use for this technology and there are very few clinicians offering this procedure in the UK.'

Numerous celebrity websites have been quick to dismiss the report that Angelina would consider such treatment on her arms.

Gossipcop.com points out that the National Enquirer 'regularly publishes and spreads outrageous and false stories about Jolie's health' and it's 'ridiculous' to believe the actress has a complex about her arms when she 'frequently makes major public appearances in arm-baring outfits'.

Meanwhile celebdirtylaundry.com states that while Angelina has a track record of having surgery for medical reasons after she had a mastectomy last year to prevent breast cancer, they believe she wouldn't have cosmetic surgery because it's 'fraught with risks, and I doubt she's willing to take them'.

Endovenous laser treatment involves having a catheter inserted into your vein and using an ultrasound scan to guide it into the correct position. A tiny laser is passed through the catheter and positioned at the top of your varicose vein.The laser delivers short bursts of energy that heat up the vein and seal it closed. The laser is slowly pulled along the vein using the ultrasound scan to guide it and allowing the entire length of the vein to be closed.Endovenous laser treatment is carried out under local anaesthetic. After the procedure you may feel some tightness in your legs and the affected areas may be bruised and painful. Nerve injury is also possible, but it's usually only temporary.
