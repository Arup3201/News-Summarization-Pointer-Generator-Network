A controlling former police detective has today been jailed for life for the brutal, pre-planned murder of his estranged wife at her high street hair salon.

A judge said Ivan Esack must serve a minimum term of 28 years before he is considered for release after the 'frenzied' attack which killed his wife Natalie, 33 in Ashford, Kent last year.

The trial had heard Esack had made 
repeated threats to kill Mrs Esack in the months before her murder, 
once telling her: 'You are a walking dead woman... tick-tock,
tick-tock'.

Life: Bullying former detective Ivan Esack, left, must serve at least 28 years for the murder of his estranged wife, Natalie, right

Evil: Ivan Esack pictured buying the knife he used to kill his wife in a Sainsburys just minutes before the attack

After finding out Natalie had started a relationship with a new 
boyfriend Justin Khadaroo, 34, he even strangled her so hard she fell 
unconscious.

Esack eventually fulfilled his threats when he burst into Esack Hair and
Beauty salon in Ashford, Kent, on April 30 last year and stabbed 
Natalie up to 11 times in front of her terrified 17-year-old employee 
and close friend, Chelsea Ford.

The attack was so ferocious the blade of the knife he had bought just 
minutes earlier in Sainsbury’s bent and the tip snapped off.

There were cheers and clapping from the public gallery today at Maidstone Crown Court in Maidstone, Kent as the sentence was 
passed.

Esack, wearing a grey suit, white shirt and black tie, showed no emotion as he was sent to prison.

Judge Charles Byers, sentencing Esack, told him: 'You cut down and 
killed a young woman who was in her prime. She was clearly much loved by
many, well liked by many more and who had a huge amount to offer this 
world.

'Not only did you take her precious life but in doing so, you devastated the lives of so many around her.

Scene of the attack: Mrs Esack was knifed to death at her high street hair salon in Ashford, Kent, (left). Judge Charles Byers, right, described the killing as 'planned to the minute'

'You had previously made her life a misery, subjecting her to extreme physical and verbal abuse.

'You sent her evil text messages, you threatened her and others in 
telephone calls, you tried to strangle her on one occasion and you had 
previously threatened her with a knife

'And yet she never offered you any malice of any sort.'

He added: 'She decided after considerable thought and with every 
justification that she had to leave you. You are a controlling man and 
the only way you could continue to control her life was to take it from 
her.

'Having threatened to do so the previous day you purchased a knife and 
walked calmly through the streets of Ashford. You were determined quite 
plainly from your body language on that CCTV in your quest and you had 
only one thing on your mind and that was her murder.

'And you had no other intention that day I’m quite satisfied with that other than to kill her. This was a calculated, pre-meditated killing planned to the minute.

'Having established she was there by looking through the window at the back of the shop, you entered.

'The shop was open to the public and it was a place where she was 
entitled to feel safe. You stabbed her repeatedly with frenzied blows 
and with such force that one of those blows penetrated her shoulder 
blade and you did that in front of a 17-year-old girl who was her friend
and colleague.

'You then walked calmly back to your car drove home and waited for arrest. You offered no help, You have showed no remorse. Even when interviewed 
that day, you displayed a degree of arrogance. But no sorrow and no 
appropriate emotion.'

In mitigation, defence counsel Oliver Saxby said of Esack: 'He has unquestionably a lack of empathy and that surely must have played a part, if not in the killing itself, but in the way it was carried out and his conduct thereafter.'

After Esack’s conviction on Friday, questions were raised about whether police had missed opportunities to protect Mrs Esack.

It emerged that she had spoken to police four times about the abusive former policeman, from 2009 to just a month before she was murdered.

According to police, Mrs Esack was unwilling to support a prosecution, and failed to return phone calls and attend meetings because she did not want to harm his prospects.

No referral was made to the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, about the previous contact between the force and Mrs Esack and no disciplinary issues were found.

The case is now the subject of an independently chaired, multi-agency review which will report next month.

Defending the police’s response, Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said on Friday: 'I’m not sure they were missed opportunities.

'Even though we don’t necessarily need the victim of domestic abuse, we can look for other evidence and we do on a daily basis. Natalie consciously didn’t want to harm Ivan’s future.'

Outside court on Friday, Mrs Esack’s father, Jim Wilkinson, told reporters: 'What can I say? Justice has been done. We are very happy with the result.'

In a statement, Miss Ford called Mrs Esack 'my closest best friend'.

She added: 'The world has lost a woman who wasn’t just beautiful on the outside but a special, caring person who’d help anyone she could.'
