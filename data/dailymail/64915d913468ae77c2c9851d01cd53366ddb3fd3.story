Luis Suarez has been included in Uruguay’s 22-man squad for two international friendlies this month in Saudi Arabia and Oman.

It will be his first selection for Uruguay since biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez announced the team Thursday for matches at Saudi Arabia on October 10 and at Oman three days later.

Suarez could play for Uruguay for the first time since the World Cup in the friendlies this week

Suarez was banned for eight international games and given a long club ban after biting Giorgio Chiellini

Although being allowed to play the friendlies, Suarez is still banned from Uruguay’s next eight competitive matches.

This means he will miss next year’s Copa America and some World Cup qualifiers. The ban also covers competitive matches until later this month for Barcelona.

Suarez has played in a youth game and friendly for Barcelona this season, but won’t return to the proper side until later this month, possibly for the El Clasico clash with Real Madrid.

The Uruguayan striker has been able to train with his new club Barcelona but cannot play competitively

Suarez has been given a run-out in youth and reserve games for Barcelona and could return soon

The bite on Chiellini didn't prevent the former Liverpool striker making his big-money move to Spain
