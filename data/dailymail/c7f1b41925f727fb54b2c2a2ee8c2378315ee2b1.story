Clearly, as an Englishman, I will be hoping we can put one over on the Scots on Tuesday night at Celtic Park in the world’s oldest international football fixture.

But part of me will be supporting at least one Scottish player. When I first met Ikechi Anya he was a very raw 19-year-old, low on confidence but with loads of ability. He was playing for Halesowen Town in the Midland League and stacking shelves at Tesco during the day. But the last time I was in touch with him was a couple of months ago after he scored for Scotland against world champions Germany.

His story is incredible and an inspiration to young players who think that being rejected by a club means the end of their dreams. ‘Kechi’ was in just that situation. He had been released by Wycombe as a 17-year-old and spent 18 months out of the professional game.

At the time, I was helping to set up an academy in Jerez where we would pick up the rejects from professional clubs and see if we could get them back into the game with some intensive coaching and education.

My former assistant, John Gorman, had known him at Wycombe. So when we were holding trials for our academy, we tracked him down and asked him along. He thought that at 19 he was too old and his chance had gone. But he showed that he had blistering pace as a right winger. And all of the coaches there — Graham Rix, Nigel Spackman, Dave Beasant, myself and John — recognised there was some raw material with which we could work.

We took him down to the academy in Jerez in southern Spain and he was with us for eight or nine months. There we developed him as a footballer and taught him about movement, positioning and how to use his pace. We also had to work on giving him some self-belief. He couldn’t see in himself what we could see — and many of the lads down there were like that, given that their confidence had taken a big knock from being rejected.

I used to joke with him that he was banned from the treatment room as he would often worry about an injury that was holding him back. Of course, players need proper treatment for their injuries, but with Kechi it was a case of giving him a more positive outlook, so that every muscle tweak did not become an issue that resulted in him being out for a few weeks.

Hopefully, we made him realise he had the talent — but he was the one who put the hard work in. He had the hunger and wanted to do it and just needed re-shaping a little mentally and tactically. He was always ready to listen and take advice on board.

Anya had to play for sides such as Halesowen Town and Northampton before joining Watford

One day we played against Sevilla’s B team and drew 1-1 and he absolutely tore them apart. They instantly wanted to have a look at him again. He went back for another game and again looked incredible — so they signed him on a two-year contract and he became the first player to leave the academy with a professional contract.

He played for Sevilla’s B team and then made some appearances for the first team before moving on to Celta.

His progress since then has been superb and he ended up with Granada, before being loaned to Watford, where he is now doing so well.

We were all very proud when he made his Scotland debut last year although he actually qualifies for four different countries, having a Nigerian father, a Romanian mother, was born in Scotland and raised in England. That night he scored against Germany in September, everyone from the academy were texting each other — and Kechi was in touch with us as well after the game.

I wouldn’t want to be too hard on the clubs which release these players — there can be a multitude of reasons why they are deemed not good enough at 16 or 17. In Kechi’s case, he had a bad injury and was playing catch-up at that age.

You might not be physically mature enough at 17 but completely different physically at 21. Perhaps the player doesn’t fit the style the manager wants. It may well drag you down at that young age if you get the idea the club isn’t positive about you. In fact, so much can go against you.

Clubs have to release players — they can’t take everyone on. But my point is that many of those we initially discard can go on to enjoy good professional careers with a little guidance and help.

Unfortunately, the academy we were running in Spain could not get the long-term funding and eventually had to close. But I still wonder if it’s an idea that the Premier League, FA and Professional Footballers’ Association might revive over here. I’m sure it would be self-funding eventually if you were producing young players like Kechi.

He is living proof that you can be cast on to football’s scrapheap far too soon. And that for those who are, with help, there is a way back — even a route to international football and the chance to score against the world champions.
