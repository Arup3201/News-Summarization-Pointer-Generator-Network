Fancy dress firms have come under fire for selling Halloween  outfits labelled as 'skitzo' and 'psycho ward', with a government minister saying the 'horrendous' costumes 'demonise' people with mental health problems.

Jokers' Masquerade's website, www.joke.co.uk, is selling a £12.45 'Adult Skitzo Costume', consisting of an orange jumpsuit with 'a set of black vinyl shackles and belt, plus a restraining face mask to complete the look'.

It also offers a £20.99 'Maximum Restraint Halloween Costume' consisting of a straightjacket and a mask similar to that worn by Anthony Hopkins when he played cannibal killer Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs.

The 'horrendous' costumes have been criticised for 'demonising' people with mental health problems 

The tasteless outfits, which can also be found on the 'Fun World' and 'Simply fancy dress' sites, have been slammed by mental health campaigners.

Liberal Democrat Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb will give a speech today urging retailers not to 'demonise' people with mental health problems by selling mocking party outfits.

Mr Lamb is due to tell the National Child and Adult Services conference in Manchester: 'For me it is horrendous that, this Halloween, a young person experiencing a mental health crisis could easily come across someone in a 'psycho ward' or 'schizo patient' costume - complete with handcuffs and ripped restraints - as much as they could see someone in a Dracula costume.

'This Halloween culture is dangerous. It conditions all of us to fear mental illness - to see people as 'psychos', or 'schizos' or 'freaks'. It makes us believe that mental illness is something other worldly.

'We have to tackle this damaging stigma which prevents young people from seeking help when they need it, or talking about any problems they might be having.

'Everyone should be able to enjoy Halloween but I urge all retailers to behave more responsibly - don't demonise mental illness.'

A petition has been launched on Change.org calling on sites such as Jokers' Masquerade to remove the costumes from their site.

The petition organiser, Rebecca Holdcroft from Leeds, wrote: 'This is offensive, stigmatising and extremely damaging not only to public perception of mental illness, but also the people affected by it. It's not right, and it should stop.'

Elsewhere, John Lawlor, chief executive of Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust (NTW), said people would never wear a 'cancer patient' Halloween outfit, and so they should not treat mental health issues so flippantly. 

Last year, supermarkets Asda and Tesco were slammed for selling Halloween costumes which were said to have caused offence.

Asda withdrew its 'mental patient fancy dress costume' and Tesco took its 'psycho ward' outfit off the shelves. 

In a blog written after Mr Lamb's criticism last week, Jokers' Masquerade's Mike Dawson said the company was disappointed to have been singled out over the 'Skitzo' outfit which is also on sale on other websites and that it had withdrawn costumes in the past, including one of Jimmy Savile.

He added that the company did not intend to offend people but wanted customers to be able to make a choice themselves, saying: 'We will not be forced into knee-jerk decisions, but are happy to receive constructive criticism.

'These past days, we have listened to the mental health proponents and made various edits to criticised products. This has included renaming product titles, descriptions and category pages to dilute this sensitive area for some.' 

Promotions staff and bar tenders at Bar Risa were given hazmat-style contamination suits to wear

An advert declared that the local area had been 'infected' by the deadly disease during the themed night

In a separate controversy, Bar Risa in Birmingham admitted it had made 'a huge error' by staging an Ebola-themed Halloween party on Wednesday night. 

An advert declared that the local area had been 'infected' by the deadly disease and that the World Health Organisation (WHO) wanted students to go to the bar for 'decontamination and quarantine'.

The bar  was decked out for the occasion with fake bio-hazard tape reading 'Quarantine' and signs in red paint outside the club told revellers they were in a 'Safe zone'.

Promotions staff and bar tenders were given hazmat-style contamination suits to wear and party-goers, many dressed as zombies, had to walk through a 'decontamination tunnel' to gain access.

The bad-taste party  comes as the WHO confirmed that nearly 5,000 people have died from Ebola, the fatal disease which has devastated Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

MailOnline reported on Sunday how websites and bars appeared to be cashing in on the Ebola crisis by selling costumes for Halloween, mocked up to look like a containment suit being worn by volunteers  treating those who are infected.

The costume appeared on the Brands On Sale website, and a description said: 'As the deadly Ebola virus trickles its way through the United States, fighting its disease is no reason to compromise style.'

Elsewhere, Asda has also been criticised for selling bloodstained cheerleader and American football player costumes.

Child-sized blue and white cheerleader and American football uniforms featuring bloodstains and extruding bones, muscle and cartilage, 'sure to be scaring everyone at those Halloween parties' are being sold on its website and in its stores.

A spokesman for Asda denied the bloodstains represented bullet holes, saying: 'We appreciate that it isn’t for everyone but the majority of our customers love dressing up at Halloween, especially in spooky or gory costumes which inevitably can include fake blood.'
