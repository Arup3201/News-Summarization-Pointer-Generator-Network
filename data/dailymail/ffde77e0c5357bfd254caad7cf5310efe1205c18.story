Early humans were able to hunt animals as large as a prehistoric elephant, according to fossils found at an ancient butchery site in Kent.

Dr Francis Wenban-Smith discovered the remains of an extinct straight-tusked elephant along with a number of flint tools dating back 420,000 years ago in Ebbsfleet.

It is thought the elephant, which was twice the size of today’s African variety, died after being hunted for its meat.

Dr Francis Wenban-Smith discovered the remains of an extinct straight-tusked elephant along with a number of flint tools dating back 420,000 years ago in Ebbsfleet, Kent

The discovery was made during the construction of the High Speed 1 rail link from the Channel Tunnel to London in 2003.

‘My first thought was "Oh no, how do we tell the High Speed 1 team that there is more archaeology to be dealt with?"’, Dr Wenban-Smith of Southampton University told MailOnline.

‘The Eureka moment for me was finding a flint core in amongst the elephant's rib cage - this confirmed the human association with the elephant. I was ecstatic.’

Researchers believe the deposits date to a warm period around 420,000 years ago, called Hoxnian interglacial.

Since the excavation, Dr Wenban-Smith (pictured) has been carrying out a detailed analysis of evidence recovered from the site, including a number of flint tools found

It is thought the elephant, which was twice the size of today's African variety and up to four times the weight of family car, died after being hunted for its meat

How skilled early humans were in hunting is still a matter of hot debate, according to Southampton University’s Dr Francs Wenban-Smith.

Prior to the discovery of these flint tools, evidence was largely based on clues about the age and sex of body parts of possible prey animals.

‘In this case, we infer the Ebbsfleet Elephant was hunted because the half-dozen Stone Age elephant butchery sites known from Europe are mostly prime adult males, and we do not think these would most often have died naturally,’ said Dr Francs Wenban-Smith.

Since the excavation, Dr Wenban-Smith has been carrying out a detailed analysis of evidence recovered from the site.

These include 80 undisturbed flint artefacts found scattered around the elephant carcass and used to butcher it. 

‘Although there is no direct evidence of how this particular animal met its end, the discovery of flint tools close to the carcass confirm butchery for its meat, probably by a group of at least four individuals,’ said Dr Wenban-Smith.

‘The finding is massively important for our understanding of what early hominins were doing, and how they were able to colonise new terrain.

‘It's so rare to find undisturbed remains of any sort from this period. This new evidence confirms the importance of elephant in their diet.'

Although it seems incredible that they could have killed such an animal, Dr Wenban Smith claims it must have been possible with wooden spears

‘We know hominins of this period had these, and an elephant skeleton with a wooden spear through its ribs was found at the site of Lehringen in Germany in 1948,’ he said.

These early humans suffered local extinction in Northern Europe during the great ice age known as the Anglian glaciation 450,000 years ago, but re-established themselves as the climate grew warmer again in the following Hoxnian interglacial. 

An ability to hunt large mammals, and in particular elephants, as suggested by the Ebbsfleet find, would go some way to explaining how these people then managed to push northwards again into what is now Britain.

The flint artefacts of these pioneer settlers are of a characteristic type known as Clactonian, mostly comprising simple razor-sharp flakes that would have been ideal for cutting meat, sometimes with notches on them that would have helped cut through the tougher animal hide.

‘The discovery of flint tools close to the carcass confirm butchery for its meat, probably by a group of at least four individuals,’ said Dr Wenban-Smith (pictured) of Southampton University

The discovery of this previously undisturbed elephant grave site is unique in Britain – where only a handful of other elephant skeletons have been found and none of which have produced similar evidence of human exploitation.

Dr Wenban-Smith explained the Ebbsfleet area would have been very different from today: ‘Rich fossilised remains surrounding the elephant skeleton, including pollen, snails and a wide variety of vertebrates, provide a remarkable record of the climate and environment the early humans inhabited.

‘Analysis of these deposits show they lived at a time of peak interglacial warmth, when the Ebbsfleet Valley was a lush, densely wooded tributary of the Thames, containing a quiet, almost stagnant swamp.‘
