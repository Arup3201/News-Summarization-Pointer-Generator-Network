The moment when a peregrine falcon swoops down and kills a duck in mid-air has been captured on film.

The breathtaking footage taken by a small camera attached to the bird's back shows Dora the falcon flying through the air, spotting the duck, swooping down and grabbing it in its talons. 

Dora then carries her prey to a safe spot where she lands and is seen eating the fresh catch.

Dora the peregrine falcon flies through the air with a small camera attached to her back on a Marshall back pack harness. She spots the duck by a stretch of water and swoops in, catching it in her talons and killing it in mid-air

During the seven-minute clip, you can hear the wind whistling passed the microphone as Dora surveys the landscape. When she spots the duck she swoops down and grabs it in her talons. This is the last frame where the duck is clearly visible before becoming a mass of feathers

After catching and killing the duck, the camera shows Dora looking to her right. She then swoops back on herself and finds a safe spot to land in order to eat her freshly caught prey

In 1908, Dr Julius Neubronner patented the 'pigeon-cam', which could be activated by a timing mechanism.

The 'pigeon-cam' were made up of mini Ticka watch cameras and were attached to pigeons in order to take aerial photos.

To
take an aerial photo, Dr Neubronner carried a pigeon to a location up 
to about 60 miles (100km) from its home, where it was equipped with a 
camera and released.

The
bird, keen to be relieved of its burden, would typically fly home on a 
direct route, at a height of 160 to 330ft (50 to 100metres).

A pneumatic system in the camera controlled the time delay before a photograph was taken.

To accommodate the burdened pigeon, the dovecote had a spacious, elastic landing board and a large entry hole.

The video was shot and and uploaded to YouTube by Drhodie.

In the video called Dora's BackCam - Peregrine taking a Duck, Dora is shown grabbing the duck at 2 minutes 56.

Drhodie, then slows the clip down to half speed so you can see the kill more clearly.

Drhodie explains in the video's description that Dora is a Peales/Anatum peregrine falcon.

The camera is dubbed the BackCam or FalCam and clips into a standard Marshall back pack then attached to Dora.

The microphone is taped over but you can still make out the wind whistling as Dora flies through the air.

There is also a thud sound when she grabs the duck.

Other Dora BackCam videos on Drhodie's YouTube channel show Dora stooping from 1500 feet, and another taken as the sun sets.

At various points during the clip, Dora the peregrine falcon turns her head and you can see her full profile filmed on the camera attached to her back by a Marshall back pack. When she lands to eat her prey you can spot a small amount of blood on her beak
