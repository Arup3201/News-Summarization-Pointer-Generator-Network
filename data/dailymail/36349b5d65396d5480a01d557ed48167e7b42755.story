A street performer is in a critical condition after reportedly falling nearly five metres from stilts and being impaled on his chest and throat.

Emergency services were called to the Chinese Youth League in the Sydney's CBD at 7.45pm on Tuesday, after reports that a 19-year-old male fell and hit his neck on a metal platform.

The teenager was believed to be training in a studio on Dixon Street, Haymarket when he suffered serious injuries and had a cardiac arrest.

Paramedics performed CPR and other treatments before the man was loaded into an ambulance and rushed to St Vincent’s Hospital in a critical condition.

Damien Baker, who was at the scene, said ‘paramedics were initially called with reports of an assault but later learned that he had fallen from stilts.'

'He was dressed in the bottom half of a Chinese dragon costume. I think what probably happened was that the stilts broke, and he was impaled onto one of them on his way down.' 

'It took a long time to get him out of the building. When he was taken into the ambulance, they took great measures to block him from the view of the crowd,' Mr Baker said.

There was a large crowd of bystanders, medical teams and plain clothed as well as uniformed officers on the scene.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Chinese Youth League for comment.

The Chinese Youth League is a Cultural Dancing Group which practices various traditional dancing routines including the Dragon Dance.

This involves a team of dancers who manipulate a  flexible figure of a dragon using stilts positioned at regular intervals along the length of the dragon.
