Hull City are continuing talks with Blackburn Rovers over a deal for Rudy Gestede.

Blackburn insist they have yet to receive a formal offer for the 26-year-old Benin international but Steve Bruce is ready to give the go-ahead for an offer of around £4million on Thursday.

Gestede has 12 goals this season and was watched by West Bromwich Albio manager Tony Pulis against Wolverhampton Wanderrs on Sunday.

However, Albion are reluctant to offer more than £3m for the French-born Benin international.

Gestede moved to Blackburn from Cardiff City in 2013 - initially on loan and then permanently - and has performed extremely well at Ewood Park.

The former Metz and Cannes forward has bagged 24 goals in 43 league appearances for Rovers since signing for the club.
