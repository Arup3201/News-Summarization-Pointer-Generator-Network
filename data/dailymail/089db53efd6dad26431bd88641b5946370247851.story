Angel di Maria scored on his Manchester United home debut as Louis van Gaal's side thrashed QPR 4-0 at Old Trafford.

First-half goals from Di Maria, as well as Ander Herrera and Wayne Rooney put the hosts in the ascendancy before Juan Mata added gloss to the scoreline in the second half.

Radamel Falcao also came off the bench to make his debut for the Red Devils as they romped to victory over Harry Redknapp's side.

Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler gives his verdict on the performance of both sets of players. 

Angel Di Maria's free-kick flies into the bottom right corner as Manchester United take the lead against QPR

 Manchester United (4-4-2)

DAVID DE GEA – First-half mistake nearly proved costly but the Spaniard made amends with a couple of smart saves 6.

RAFAEL – The Brazilian looked fired up and determined to prove a point following speculation that he could be on his way 6.5.

JONNY EVANS – Far more comfortable in a four-man defence and produced a fantastic block to deny Phillips an open goal in the first half 6.5.

TYLER BLACKETT  – Amid the big-money arrivals at United, the homegrown youngster continues to blend in comfortably and capable 6.5.

MARCOS ROJO  – Quieter debut at left back than United’s other new boys but dealt with everything that came his way. There will be sterner tests than this 6.

DALEY BLIND  – He prefers a midfield holding role to left back and showed why. Looked comfortable from the start. No fuss, no problem for the Dutchman 7.

ANDER HERRERA  – Poor distribution early on but grew into the game and excelled after that, scoring the second and having a hand in the third. 7.

Ander Herrera's precise drive doubled Manchester United's lead against QPR

JUAN MATA  – Some questioned whether he would have a place in the new order, but played well behind the two strikers and weighed in with a goal. 6.5.

ANGEL DI MARIA – Has there been a better home debut at Old Trafford than this since Rooney’s hat-trick against Fenerbahce in 2004? Scored one, had a hand in three more. Outstanding 8.5.

WAYNE ROONEY – He’s no longer the lone star at United but still showed his worth with a well-taken strike to make it 3-0 and put the game beyond QPR 7.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE  – Still not at the top of his game amid concerns that he might still be hampered by old knee problems. Booked for a poor challenge 5.5

SUBS: Shaw, Falcao (for Mata 67, 5.5), Januzaj (for Di Maria 82), Lindegaard, Fletcher, Valencia (for Rafael 67, 6), Pereira.

SUBS NOT USED: Shaw, Lindegaard, Fletcher, Pereira.

SCORERS: Di Maria 24, Herrera 36, Rooney 44, Mata 58

QPR (4-3-3) 

ROB GREEN  – Could possibly have done better with the first goal but couldn’t be faulted for the others and kept the score down 6.5

MAURICIO ISLA – Had the misfortune to come up against Di Maria on a day when the most expensive player in the history of British football was simply on fire 5

STEVEN CAULKER  – Tried to stem the tide but wasn’t nearly tight enough on Rooney when he fired in the third goal from the edge of the box 5.5

RIO FERDINAND – Probably cursing his luck that his return to United didn’t come a couple of weeks earlier. He’s been on the other side of these results enough times at Old Trafford 5.5.

CLINT HILL  – Looked to be struggling in the first half in every sense, and was subbed at the interval 5.

SANDRO  – Worked hard in a holding role in front of the back four, but there could have been four of him and they would still have struggled to contain United 6.

MATT PHILLIPS – Had the best chance to equalise after De Gea’s error in the first half but didn’t take it and there was only going to be one result after that 6.

LEROY FER  – Worked hard in the centre of midfield in very difficult circumstances. They won’t come any harder than this 5.5.

NIKO KRANJCAR  – Had a chance to pull a goal back early in the second half but his  effort was well saved by De Gea 6.

JUNIOR HOILETT – Starved of possession and had very little opportunity to make an impact on the game 5.5.

CHARLIE AUSTIN  – Thankless task ploughing that lone furrow up front and the former Burnley man was finally given a breather 14 minutes after half-time 6.

VIDEO We were unlucky - Redknapp 

SUBS: McCarthy, Traore (for Hill 46, 6), Onuoha, Henry (for Sandro 74, 6), Vargas (for Austin 59, 5.5), Zamora, Taarabt
