President Barack Obama will make his first appearance on the campaign trail this fall  when he headlines a rally for Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy next week.

The Associated Press reported today that Obama will stump for Malloy next Wednesday, Oct. 15.

The president has spoken at more than 50 private fundraisers this year but  only one that directly benefited a candidate - mostly because Democrats running for office have suggested he stay away.

The time Obama did agree to campaign for a Democratic lawmaker, Colorado's Mark Udall, the senator ditched on the day of and Obama had to attend a fundraiser for Udall's campaign alone.

Obama has consistently earned approval numbers in the mid-to-low 40s throughout the last several months, and Democratic candidates for statewide and federal offices are fearful of how photos of them standing side by side with the president will play with voters who are unhappy with his policies.

Instead, they've invited other top Democrats, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden and First Lady Michelle Obama, to their home states to campaign with them.

'The president is dealing with a lot of crisis in the world right now. I think it's important for him to continue to address what's happening with ISIS and continue to address the Ebola scare. I expect him to be in Washington,' one endangered Democrat, New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, said today when asked by MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell if she'd like Obama to join her on the trail.

Malloy doesn't seem to mind affiliating with Obama in public, however, having lunched with him earlier this year during one of the president's trips to his state and inviting him back for an official campaign event next week. 

The incumbent Democratic governor is locked in a dead heat with his Republican challenger, retired businessman and former U.S. ambassador Tom Foley.

Foley ran against Malloy for the state's top executive position in 2010 and lost by just half a percentage point. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday has Foley tied with Malloy at 43 percent.

'It looks like we're heading for another photo finish - just like in 2010,' Douglas Schwartz, director of the Quinnipiac  poll, said of the rematch in a statement.

President Obama won Connecticut by 17 points in 2012, making Democrat Malloy's reelection a seemingly forgone conclusion just months ago.

But even Connecticut residents have grown tired of Obama more than two years out from the end of his presidency, and they could end up taking their frustrations with the nation's leader out on Malloy.

A poll of the state conducted by Quinnipiac in March, when Obama last visited the state, found that just 45 percent of the Connecticut residents viewed Obama positively. The majority, 51 percent, had a negative opinion of the way the president was doing his job.

According to Quinnipiac it's the worst Obama's ever polled in the state. No surveys of the state have been taken since.
