The bodyguard of a billionaire Australian heiress was found hanged at an exclusive London hotel after he feared he had 'let her down' by getting drunk in front of her friends, an inquest heard.

Ginia Rinehart, the daughter of Australia’s richest woman Gina Rinehart, discovered her close friend and minder Jeremiah 'Jerry' Rouwhorst, 35, unconscious and naked on the floor of his suite at the world-famous Dorchester Hotel.

Hours earlier the 'ashamed' Australian ex-special forces soldier had sent the 27-year-old a text message saying he was going to resign because he felt he had 'disgraced' her in front of her friends by getting drunk the night before.

The pair had spent three months at the Dorchester and Mr Rouwhorst had organised a farewell party for his client, the heiress to an £11billion fortune, before she returned to Australia.

But normally 'professional' Mr Rouwhorst had consumed an 'uncharacteristic' amount of alcohol, Westminster Coroner’s Court heard.

Assistant Coroner Shirley Radcliffe said: 'At 10.27 he sent her a text message saying they he felt he had disgraced her, let her down, embarrassed her in front of her friends and he was tendering his resignation.

'It is possible he sent the text message as a possible cry for help and was hoping to be found. I cannot be sure he wanted to kill himself.

'One
 thinks that this may have been an impulsive gesture whilst under the 
influence of alcohol. He was devastated at having lost an element of his
 professionalism the night before.'

The
 court heard that after the party organised by Mr Rouwhorst, Ms Rinehart
 went on to spend the rest of the night with friends in Chelsea, before 
calling her bodyguard at 8am on March 16 to pick her up.

She then went straight to bed and did not read the text until around midday when she rushed to see him in the adjoining room.

Scene: Miss Rinehart and her minder Mr Rouwhorst had been staying at the famous Dorchester Hotel in central London for three months before his death

Emergency: Police officers and paramedics were called to the five-star hotel in London¿s Park Lane - a favourite with celebrities where rooms can cost up to £4,000 a night

Police
 officers and paramedics were called to the five-star hotel in London’s 
Park Lane - a favourite with celebrities where rooms can cost up to 
£4,000 a night.

Hotel security arrived at the room to find Ms Rinehart 'hysterical' and pointing to where her confidante lay, the court heard.

Police officer Aaron King, who attended the scene and spoke to the 27-year-old who will inherit the billions amassed by her mining magnate family, said she was very upset.

'She was very distressed and crying on the phone to her mother,' he said.

'She said that because he didn’t usually drink that much he was ashamed of how much he had had to drink the night before and he thought that he must have brought shame on her and her friends.'

PC King explained that he also spoke to Ms Rineharts’s mother, Gina, on the phone.

'The mother explained that he is a very professional man and would never drink that much - it was out of character,' he said.

Professional: A police officer told the inquest that he had spoken to Gina Rinehart on the telephone, and was told that Mr Rouwhorst 'would never drink that much'

Dr Radcliffe asked if the heiress had given any possible reason for the Australian ex-elite forces soldier having drank so much.

The officer replied that he didn’t really have an opportunity to speak to her in detail, adding: 'She was obviously very distressed and at one point she even collapsed in the hotel corridor.'

Paramedics at the scene were able to revive Mr Rouwhorst and he was taken to St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, west London, but died three days later on March 19.

Blood tests at he hospital revealed that he was more than one and half times over the legal drink driving limit at 113mg/100ml.

Just two 
days before his death, Mr Rouwhorst had received a commendation for 
bravery, having been honoured for saving a man’s life during a riot in 
East Timor in 2007.

After leaving the Australian Special 
Air Services in 2005, he went on to work as a private security guard for
 the Australian ambassador in Afghanistan and Iraq, before providing 
personal security to the Rinehart family, and in particular, Ginia 
Rinehart.

Recording an open verdict, Dr Radcliffe said: 'This may have been suicide, I cannot be sure. It may have been an accident, I cannot be sure.'
