Sun is forecasted for the Super Bowl kickoff this Sunday - but it will still be the coldest on record.

The Weather Channel predicts a high of 37F (3C) and a low of 24 F (-4C) on Sunday with sun, a low chance of showers and slow winds in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home to the MetLife Stadium.

While this is far kinder than commentators, fans and meteorologists have predicted in the weeks leading up to Sunday's game, it will still take the crown for the coldest ever Super Bowl.

The current record is 39 degrees, which was set in 1972 in New Orleans.

Promising: The weather forecast for the Super Bowl, which is being held in New Jersey, shows that it'll be sunny in the afternoon - easing fears that it'll be too treacherous for fans and players

Chill: But even though there are low chances of rain, it is still expected to be the coldest Super Bowl on record as the rest of the country also battles freezing temperatures

This weekend's chilly temperatures mean that spectators will have to take precautions before watching the Seahawks battle the Broncos.

Fans will get Warm Welcome packs that include ear muffs, hand warmers and lip balm to try and combat the chill inside the stadium.

Super Bowl officials are also encouraging fans
 to wear layers and arrive early to avoid any traffic delays from the weather.

They added that crews are ready to clear 
the stadium and streets of snow and ice should the area face more snow, the News Tribune reported.

Getting ready: Crews were forced to shovel out the spectator stands following the snowstorm

The wettest Super Bowl XLI, 2007, in Miami, where the Indianapolis Colts and Chicago Bears endured almost an inch of rain

The coldest Super Bowl VI, 1972, in New Orleans, where the Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins battled each other in temperatures of 39F

The hottest Super Bowl XXXVII, in 2003, in San Diego, where the Oakland Raiders and Tama Bay played in 82 degrees. This was matched in 1973, in Los Angeles, as the Miami Dolphins and Washington Redskins played

The windiest Super Bowl XIV, 1980 in Pasadena, where gusts of winds reached 30mph in the northeast as the Los Angeles Rams and Pittsburgh Steelers played

AccuWeather also warned against 
troublesome travel conditions, saying it expects 'a typical winter day' 
and potentially 'slushy roads'.

The
 promising forecast comes after weeks of speculation about whether the 
game would go ahead, after the area was blanketed with snow in recent 
cold snaps.

The NFL had even considered moving the time of the game if officials concluded that the fans' safety was in danger.

It meant that the choice of New Jersey sparked upset from commentators, including form Chicago Bears coach, Mike Ditka.

'The weather's going to be a problem,' Ditka told the Detroit Free Press. 'They made a big mistake. The game shouldn’t be there. I mean, it’s stupid.'

He added that the choice of stadium isn't fair on the players, who want to show off their skills.

'It'd be nice to be playing in Miami or 
San Diego or New Orleans or somewhere the weather is conducive to guys 
being able to show their talents,' he said.

'It's not fair to the players. It's not going to be fair to the fans. It's not going to be that enjoyable.'

Chill: Fans at the MetLife Stadium, pictured on Monday with the Manhattan skyline in the background, could experience a high temperature of 37F (3C) and a low of 24 F (-4C)

No complaints: Despite the cold, Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning said they were excited to be there

The players arrived in the Big Apple 
on Sunday to freezing temperatures and snow on the ground - but they 
didn't have any complaints.

'My
 team is excited,' Peyton Manning said after the Broncos’ flight landed 
in New Jersey. 'We worked hard to earn this opportunity. We couldn’t be 
more excited.

'We were excited getting on that plane and excited getting off that plane.'
