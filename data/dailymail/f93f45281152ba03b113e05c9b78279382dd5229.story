Hollywood stuntmen have got nothing on a driver who had an amazing escape after a bizarre incident in a suburban Russian street.

Two different videos captured the man's Land Rover seemingly traveling at normal speed down the residential street when it goes over a manhole.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO...

Alarm: The SUV starts to rise in the air as the manhole shoots explodes out of the ground

The metal cover then shoots up, causing The Freelander 2 to suddenly flip up and almost totally leave the ground totally as its boot shoots into the air.

The car then goes into a full 360 degree roll and almost completes a second roll, before coming to rest on its side.

Rise: A woman can be seen walking on the pavement as the Land Rover starts to lift off the ground

Unexpected: Three of the cars four wheels are off the ground as the vehicle goes into a barrel roll

Side: The vehicle comes to a rest close to the now exposed manhole which seems to have exploded

After a moment alarmed passers-by approach the Land Rover, as does the driver of the vehicle behind who captured the incident on camera.

One man quickly scans the roof of the upturned car before reaching in through where its windscreen used to be.

Concern: A passer-by helps the driver from the vehicle, through its smashed windscreen

Uninjured: The shocked Land Rover driver (in cream jacket) is left scratching his head after the bizarre incident

The dazed driver then emerges, almost unaided and after a quick stumble the man in a cream jacket stands up straight and has quick look around.

He then steps back from the Land Rover, seemingly unharmed, and can be seen scratching his head trying to work out what had happened.

Unexplained: The manhole seems to explode sending the car in front into a barrel roll

What caused the cover to blow is not clear, but afterwards it can be seen on the ground near the car.

The fact that a fixed street camera caught the incident, as well as a second driver, suggests the incident was not a set-up.
