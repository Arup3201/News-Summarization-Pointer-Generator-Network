This is the moment proud military police from the Afghan National Army 'graduated' from a training course run by British troops.

The 'warriors' had just spent three weeks being trained in mortar weaponry by a Scottish battalion, at the end of an intensive  four-month course.

They also learned about first aid, counter IED (improvised explosive device) operations and vehicle maintenance in Helmand province.

It is hoped that Afghan soldiers will soon be able to take over the security of their country.

A unit from The Royal Scots Borderers, 
1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland, rounded off their 
instruction with the mortar weapons course during a six-month operational tour of Helmand province.

Some of the Afghans are learning to be instructors themselves, in the hope that eventually British troops will no longer be needed and security and training can be handed over to the Afghan National Security Forces.

Colour Sergeant William Mair, 37, who leads the mortar training and advisory team, said: 'During the three-week course, they learned to assemble and dismantle the 81mm mortar and the 82mm mortar systems.

'They also learned how to "lay on" to a target for when they are on the ground and want to aim and fire at something.

'In the last couple of days, we finished off with a bit of live firing so they got a chance to put all of the skills they had learned into practice.

'We will also run a more advanced course to teach the best of the bunch how to be mortar instructors.'

C/Sgt Mair, who is originally from Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, but now lives with his wife and daughter in Darlington, added: 'The overall aim of these training courses is that when we move out or take a step back, the ANA can establish their own mortar platoon and be able to conduct their own training.

'I feel very proud because it shows we've made a name here and achieved our aim.

'We've managed to get them up to a good standard so we're confident we can take a step back and let them crack on on their own.'

At the ceremony, the group of about 20 warriors were handed certificates, signalling that they are qualified to fire mortar weapons.

Captain Alistair Cuthbertson, 44, who is originally from Barrhead and a training adviser with 1 SCOTS, told them through an interpreter: 'This is the start of your future as good quality mortar men and hopefully, in the future, mortar instructors.'

More than 177 military police graduated yesterday.
