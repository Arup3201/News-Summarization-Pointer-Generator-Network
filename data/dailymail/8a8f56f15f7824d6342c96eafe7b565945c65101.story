'A final decision has yet to be made but their main family home will be at Kensington Palace.'

William has said that he wants to be a 'hands on' father and will not take a job that requires him to be away from his young family.

The Duke of Cambridge's royal commitments are due to increase as the 
Queen, 87, and Duke of Edinburgh, who is almost 92, take on fewer 
projects.

William's decision to leave RAF Valley is said to be linked to his opposition to the selling of the search and rescue service.

Prince William is considering taking on full-time royal duties. This week, William and Kate visited the Harry Potter set on Warner Bros Studios

William has said he wants to be close to his new family to be as involved with his first child as possible

He opposed privitisation plans that went ahead last month, which means the Sea Kings will be replaced.

The young couple were favourites in Anglesey since they moved there in April 2011.

They were spotted going to the White Eagle pub and Kate was a regular shopper at a local Waitrose supermarket.

Locals said they will be missed. Dave Buckland, the owner of a surf shop, said: 'They've brought a lot to Anglesey and we're very happy with that'.

The palace did not comment.
