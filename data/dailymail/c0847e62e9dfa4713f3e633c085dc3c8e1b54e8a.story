KFC is investigating claims that an employee at one of its restaurants told a three-year-old girl to leave because facial scars that she sustained in a dog attack were scaring other customers.

The company said it would also be giving $30,000 to Victoria Wilcher's charity following the incident in Jackson, Mississippi to help her family pay her medical bills, a spokesman said on Sunday.

'As soon as we were notified of this report on Friday, we immediately began an investigation, as this kind of hurtful and disrespectful action would not be tolerated by KFC,' KFC's Rick Maynard said.

'Regardless
 of the outcome of our investigation, we have apologized to Victoria's 
family and are committed to assisting them. The company is making a 
$30,000 donation to assist with her medical bills. The entire KFC family
 is behind Victoria.'

Victim: Victoria Wilcher, three, was mauled by three pit bulls in April - and last week she was asked to leave a KFC in Mississippi because her injuries were 'scaring other customers'. KFC is now investigating the claims

The cruel comments, which the girl had heard, came to light last week after Victoria's family shared the story on her Facebook page, Victoria's Victories.

'Does this face look scary to you?' the post read. 'Last 
week at KFC in Jackson MS this precious face was asked to leave because 
her face scared the other diners.'

The post noted that the little girl had cried all the way home and is now scared to go out in public.

KFC responded to the post on Facebook, immediately apologizing and asking for further details.

Victoria had been injured in April when three of her grandfather's pit 
bull dogs ran into his home in Simpson County by ripping through the back door of the home before jumping on her.

Scene: An employee at this Jackson, Mississippi store reportedly told Victoria and her grandmother to leave

Hurt: Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, said her granddaughter cried following the worker's comments

They dragged the little girl outside into the backyard, where they
 continued to maul her before her grandfather, Donald Mullins, and his 
girlfriend, Rita Tompkins, attempted to stop the carnage.

The dogs then 
attacked their owners, causing Mullins to shoot them. Two of the dogs 
were killed.

Victoria was rushed to the emergency room. She suffered a shattered top and 
bottom jaw, broken cheekbones and eyesockets, a broken nose, lost her
 right eye, and lost the ability to move the right side of her face.

Mullins and Tompkins were arrested on charges of child endangerment and their eight surviving pit bulls were seized by Animal 
Control officers.

Victoria was in the hospital for a month after the attack and ipon her return home, she 
continued with physical therapy and wore a feeding tube.

Apology: The family shared the story on Victoria's Facebook page and KFC soon responded with an apology

Following a visit to the doctors, Victoria and her grandmother, Kelly Mullins, went into a KFC.

'I took her to the doctor and I went to KFC,' Wilcher's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, told WAPT.

'I ordered a large sweet 
tea and her some mashed potatoes and gravy because she was hungry. She 
was on a feeding tube at the time, but I figured she could just swallow 
(the potatoes).'

'They just told us, they said, "We have 
to ask you to leave because her face is disrupting our customers". 
(Victoria) understood exactly what they said.'

Mullins said she put Victoria in the car and left. She said Victoria cried all the way home.

Attack: Victoria is pictured left before the attack in April. Right, she is pictured the hospital six hours after her grandfather's dogs attacked her - claiming her right eye in the incident and causing facial paralysis

Getting better: She is expected to undergo several more surgeries in the future as she heals from the attack

'Now when we go somewhere, she don't want to get out,' said Mullins.

After the family shared the story on Thursday, KFC responded in comment section of the original post, saying: 'Please accept our sincere apologies while we try to investigate this incident.'

On Friday, the family posted onto the page, acknowledging the huge response they received.

'KFC 
has reached out for more information thanks to the overwhelming support 
for Victoria,' they said.

'Thank you for sharing her story and please continue to 
pray for her and her recovery. She still has several surgeries in her 
future and will continue to need our love and support.'
