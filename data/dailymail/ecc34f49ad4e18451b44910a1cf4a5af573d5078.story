Sunderland are set to sign former loanee Santiago Vergini – but Chelsea winger Christian Atsu will not be heading to the Stadium of Light.

There were reports on Wednesday that the Black Cats had made an approach for Atsu, the 22-year-old Ghana winger who is yet to appear for the Blues’ senior side.

But manager Gus Poyet has distanced the club from a move for the player who spent last year on loan at Vitesse in Holland.

Closing in: Sunderland are set to sign former loanee Santiago Vergini after he impressed last season

Vergini, however, looks set for a return to the North East. He impressed during the second half of last season and Poyet is keen to add the versatile defender to his threadbare squad.

The 25-year-old – who has been capped once by Argentina - is currently contracted to Estudiantes in his homeland.

Missing out: Sunderland will not be signing Christian Atsu from Chelsea

Poyet has signed Wigan midfielder Jordi Gomez, defenders Patrick van Aanholt and Billy Jones and Manchester City keeper Costel Pantilimon this summer, but is still desperate to strengthen his squad before the season kicks off in just over a fortnight’s time.

Liverpool striker Fabio Borini remains at the top of his wish-list – a £14million bid has been accepted – but the player is thought to be considering his options before committing to a return to Wearside, where he spent last season on loan.
