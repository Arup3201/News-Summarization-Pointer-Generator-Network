David Moyes claims we haven't seen the best of Manchester United yet, despite their resounding 5-0 victory over German side Bayer Leverkusen this week.

Moyes, who will pit his team against Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday, believes United can prove their Premier League title credentials on a more consistent basis.

'I still think the best is still to come,' the former Everton manager said. 'I still think we can continue to improve and progress.

Impressed: But David Moyes (right) believes Manchester United still have more to give

'We've had some little bits of 
inconsistency at times, which we need to do better with, but I think 
there are moments when we're beginning to show we're coming right back 
into form.

'Midweek certainly showed what we're capable of when we're playing well, and the job is to do that week-in, week-out.'

The
United boss believes his champions - in particular the lethal 
partnership of Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney - should be considered 
among the best teams in the Premier League.

'I
think we compare with anyone. There have been 
quite a few changes in strike partnerships in the Premier League and 
some very good forwards, and as you'd expect, I think we've got a 
partnership to rival any of them.'

Rooney was instrumental in the 
win at the BayArena which sealed their qualification to the Champions 
League knock-out stages. The England forward set up four of the five 
goals while the visitors made a mockery of Leverkusen's unbeaten home 
record.

Ryan
Giggs, who turned 40 on Friday, was also in fine fettle in Leverkusen, 
impressing his manager with an elegant display in centre midfield. 

'Ryan is undoubtedly at the top of any list of Premier League legends, for all sorts of reasons.

'Because
of his longevity, playing his entire career at a club like Manchester 
United, the amount of games he has played in Europe and the Premier 
League and the fact that he has provided so many outstanding memories 
every single season.

'It is terrific to be doing it at his 
age, and it is an example to young players everywhere to see how far you
can go with the right dedication. It is also an example to players in 
their mid-30s, who may be wondering whether they are coming to the end 
of the road, to see that if you keep training well and looking after 
yourself, you can carry on longer. 

'When
you get to his age, any decision about carrying on is left until the 
end of the season. Don't forget, he's on the coaching staff anyway, but 
if he feels he wants to continue next season I'll
be more than happy with that.'

'There were a few surprises for him in the
dressing room to mark his birthday. A coach's watch was one, so maybe 
they are trying to send him a message!'

'I think he was beginning to think they were pushing him out of the dressing-room!

'They're
very good. He's respected by everyone in the dressing-room because of 
what he's done and what he's achieved in football.'

Turning
his attention to United's game in north London on Sunday, as well as 
saying a number of injured players, including Robin van Persie 'have a 
chance' of playing, Moyes is expecting another thriller.

He said: 'They are always good games. We will go there and try to win, as we always do.'

During his pre-match press conference, Moyes was pressed about potential moves in the January transfer window.

He said United would only sign players 'if the right players are available and they fit exactly what we want.'

He added: 'We would like to [sign players], but as always there are no guarantees.'

United chased one of Moyes former players Leighton Baines for much of the summer, and the Scot was asked whether the Reds would return for the Everton full back in the future.

'If they are determined to hold on to him [Baines] then he can't be going anywhere,' Moyes said. 'So it's worthless asking me the question.'
