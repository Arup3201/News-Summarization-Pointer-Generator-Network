NHS chief Sir David Nicholson is to be summoned for another bruising clash with MPs as it emerged that a Cabinet minister has joined calls for him to be sacked.

Sir David, who is under pressure to resign in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, will be called before the Commons Public Accounts Committee to discuss a string of disastrous NHS IT projects.

But a source on the committee told the Daily Mail that MPs ‘will want to ask him’ about his expenses, which totalled just under £50,000 last year.

Scrutiny: Sir David Nicholson, NHS chief executive, will face questions about his £50,000 expenses when he goes before MPs to account for the health service's IT expenditure, according to a source

This was on top of his £211,000 salary, £20,000 bonus and around £47,000 of ‘benefits in kind’.

Until 2011, he was also given a taxpayer-funded sum of just under £60,000 to pay for a rented flat in the capital – an arrangement attacked by Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude as a ‘relic of the past’.

Yesterday it emerged Mr Maude has argued for weeks that Sir David’s departure is necessary if accountability is to mean anything in the public sector.

Ministers fear a critical focus on Sir David’s pay and perks could prove the final straw following weeks of controversy since an inquiry found up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly at the Mid Staffordshire trust.

Sir David was in charge of the regional health authority responsible for Stafford Hospital for ten months at the height of the failings in care at the trust.

And the Prime Minister is said to have privately told colleagues he will not tie himself closely to Sir David after being warned that damaging revelations are to come.

A Cabinet source said: ‘Francis Maude has been one of the voices telling No10 that Nicholson should go, from the point of view of civil service accountability more than anything else.’

Giving evidence to Parliament, Sir David insisted his health authority had ‘no idea’ about the problems at Mid Staffs.

But at a private meeting of Tory MPs this week, only one thought he should keep his job.Jeremy Hunt, who took over as Health Secretary in last year’s reshuffle, will have to implement complex structural reforms drawn up by his predecessor and Sir David.

A Government source said that,  as a result, he was ‘in thrall’ to the NHS boss. It has also emerged  that Sir David could face a private prosecution for corporate manslaughter over the deaths at Mid Staffs.

Retired investment banker Alan Edwards has applied to Camberwell Green magistrates in London for permission to prosecute Sir David for corporate manslaughter, misconduct in public office, perverting the course of justice and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
