The sun may still be shining but the AW14 collections have already started to drop in store and thoughts are turning to wrapping up warm for winter.

The upcoming season is all about wool, chunky knits and blanket coats and who better than Cara Delevingne to show us how to pull off the look?

The British supermodel and long-time Burberry girl is the star of the brand's latest campaign and looks chic and autumnal in the brand's seasonal offerings.

New campaign: Cara Delevingne, left, stars alongside Malaika Firth in Burberry's new AW14 Bloomsbury-inspired campaign

Starring alongside newcomer Malaika Firth, as well as male models Callum Ball and Oli Green, Cara showcases a golden glow and voluminous hair as she acts as a clothes horse for the brand.

In some behind the scenes shots, she can be seen larking around with Tarun Nijjer, the latest newcomer to Burberry and the first male model of Indian descent to ever work for the brand. He opened and closed the menswear show in January and it is clear the pair have on-set chemistry.

Shot by 
Mario Testino (who else?), the campaign aims to reflect the artistic 
spirit of the collection, which features hand-painted techniques, 
monogrammed ponchos and the iconic Heritage trench coat. 

Speaking
 about the new campaign, Christopher Bailey, Chief Creative and Chief 
Executive Officer of Burberry, said: 'A dynamic British cast brings the 
artistic spirit of the campaign to life with the iconic Burberry trench 
coat at its heart.'

Big hair, don't care! Cara rocks a voluminous hairstyle as she poses with Tarun Nijjer, the latest newcomer to Burberry and the first male model of Indian descent to ever work for the brand. He opened and closed the menswear show in January

Bailey 
first showcased the range at London Fashion Week in February when he 
sent out all his models - including Cara and Suki - wearing wool blanket
 
ponchos, knitted in muted yellows, reds and blues, complete with the 
models' monogrammed initials.

Elsewhere,
bold nature-inspired prints were emblazoned on dresses and silk 
scarves, silk cotton organdy dresses were hand painted, while flowers were painted on buttersoft shoes and bags.

The
show, called The Bloomsbury Girls, took inspiration from the Bloomsbury set and Charleston, the country home 
and meeting place for the writers, painters and intellectuals who formed
the group.

It was an 
explosion of rich, yet natural, colour: elderberry, cameo pink, 
blackcurrant, slate blue, antique rose, russet red ink blue, bottle 
green, burnt amber, olive, amethyst, larch yellow, camel, black 
amethyst... the list goes on. And soon, you'll be able to get your hands on it.

Peekaboo! Cara has been a long-time family member of Burberry and one of her first ever high fashion campaign was with the brand

As well as her stellar modelling career, Cara is set to light up the screens in her upcoming film, Tulip 
Fever, as it has been revealed the supermodel has filmed her sex scene 
for the flick.

Cara, 21, shot her ‘steamy romp’ with co-star Matthew Morrision - who is famous for his role as Mr Schue on Glee.

‘If anything, it was Matthew who was the more nervous and asked for a closed set so all the crew couldn’t watch’.

The
 insider added that Cara proved she could act just as well as other 
professionals and seemed unfazed about having to ‘kiss and roll around’ 
with her co-star.

Speaking to The Sun, a source said: ‘The scene was the first time Cara has had to be saucy on screen and she pulled it off well.

Tulip Fever 
is a 17th century romance in which an artist falls for a married young 
woman while he's commissioned to paint her portrait.

The two then invest in the risky tulip market in hopes to build a future together.

Cara will be working with an impressive cast which includes Dane Dehaan, Dame Judi Dench, Tom Hollander and Zach Galafianakis.
