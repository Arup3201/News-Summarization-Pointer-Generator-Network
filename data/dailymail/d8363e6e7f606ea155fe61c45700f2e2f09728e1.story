Slimline: The Aga City60, promoted by model Daisy 
Lowe, is 60cm wide - which means it will fit into a standard kitchen 
cabinet space - and costs £4,995

They used to be the cooker of choice for well-to-do country dwellers.

But now Aga are hoping to attract a new generation of city types to their product with a slimmer electric version of their classic cooker.

The Aga City60 is half as wide as the traditional oven at just 60cm - meaning it will fit into a standard kitchen cabinet space.

And it is also half the price, costing £4,995.

The traditional oil fuel has also been replaced by electric, meaning that the oven no longer has to be left on all day in order to cook on it.

Instead the baking and roasting oven can be programmed to a specific temperature as with a classic oven, though in the winter it can still be left on all day in order to heat a room.

The new unit has two cooking drawers, along with a single hob on top covered with a hood.

It is available in two different styles - a slimmed down contemporary version, or with more of the original chunky features.

It is available in a range of pastel colours, and is still made from cast iron which cooks the food as it warms up, unlike a traditional cooker which uses heating elements.

Chief 
executive William McGrath described it as 'an important ingredient to 
our growth plans' and said he hopes it will 'grab the attention of new 
urban consumers'.

The new product has come after it emerged just one in 20 Aga customers now buys the old-fashioned oil-powered models.

Instead, Aga's electrical cookers, which can be controlled with smartphones, now make up almost three quarters of its sales.

Agas have been an established part of the British countryside since the first heat-storage cooker was invented in 1922.

Nobel
 Prize-winning physicist Dr Gustaf Dalén created the first Aga while 
confined to his home after a failed experiment left him blind.

With two ovens and two large hotplates, the Aga allowed for all types of cooking simultaneously.

They began to be manufactured at a factory in Smethwick, West Midlands, and were first sold to the public in 1929.

The news came as Aga posted a 3.3 per cent rise in revenue for the first six 
months of the year.

While the company reported a first-half loss of £300,000, this
 was far smaller than the £2.4m loss in the same period last year.

Experts put the the spike in sales to the strong housing market in the UK in recent months.

Better job security also meant that people were willing to splash out on large purchases such as kitchen appliances, rather than holding on to their money.

symbol among China’s burgeoning middle-classes

Aga, based in Leamington Spa, said the appetite for the kitchen appliance 
was growing, despite uncertainties around interest rates and the 
mortgage market.

Helal
 Miah, an investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: ‘I

 know salaries are not up, but consumer confidence is good.

'If people 
are feeling confident that they will hold on to their jobs, it helps 
when it comes to forking out quite a bit of money on a high-end cooker. 
Aga was fairly battered by the housing crisis but things are looking 
up.’

Some of the firm's improvement has came about 
thanks to the burgeoning popularity of the cookers among Chinese buyers.

The quintessentially British oven has become a sought-after status 
symbol among China’s burgeoning middle-classes.

Aga 
Rangemaster will sell its first cookers in China this autumn, and 
analysts said they had become akin to owning ‘a BMW or a Mercedes’ in 
the far-east.
