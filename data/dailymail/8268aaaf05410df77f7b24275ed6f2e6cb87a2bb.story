QPR's move to sign Michael Laudrup appears doomed to fail, with the Dane telling associates in Denmark that he wants to see out his contract with Qatari club Lekhwiya.

His agent, Bayram Tutumlu, told Sportsmail on Wednesday that Lekhwiya were unlikely to release the 50-year-old from his deal, which expires in June.

Sportsmail has also been told by a separate source close to the former Swansea manager that he intends to honour that contract, with Lekhwiya currently top of their league.

It increases the possibility of caretaker manager Chris Ramsey seeing out the season. Ramsey is a popular coach and respected by the QPR players and on Monday said he would 'jump at the chance' to lead the club in the longer term.

Tutumlu later told reporters: 'Laudrup is under contract with Qatari club Lekhwiya. Out of respect anyone interested in him should contact the club.

'I don't think they would let him go because the team are in so many tournaments and competitions.'

He added: 'Michael has taken (Lekhwiya) them to first place in the league and he is regarded as the most important person in the club right now.

'I don't think it is the right thing for Michael to leave now and go because he has agreed a contract with these people. I don't think it's possible.

'I don't want to speak about whether QPR have been in contact, that's private. I can only say he loves English football and the Premier League. It's just not possible right now.

'In June his contract will finish and he will be free. I'm not sure if they will want compensation to let him go now, first QPR have to talk to them.

'You can never say never and he could return to the Premier League. If the right club comes, the right project - why not?'
