Claims firm parasites have taken up to £5billion of the compensation paid to victims of the PPI mis-selling scandal.

Many companies sent people nuisance texts or cold-called them to create a lucrative database of victims.

They then made claims for refunds of payment protection insurance premiums, often without being clear that they would take up to 25 per cent.

As a result, people who had been duped by the big banks into buying unnecessary insurance to cover the repayments on loans, credit cards and mortgages were ripped off a second time by the claims firms.

Britain’s major banks have set aside more than £22billion for refunds to victims of the biggest scandal in retail banking.

Anyone mis-sold PPI should be able to claim a refund themselves for free by using a standard complaints letter.

But many banks made it hard for customers, allowing claims firms to fill the gap and offer to help before creaming off much of the money that was returned.

The scale of the rip-off was revealed today by Citizens Advice, which has been helping many let down by claims firms.

It said almost one in three people who used a claims management company complained they were put under pressure to pursue a refund, while 27 per cent said the fee was not explained.

Some whose claims were successful may actually have ended up in debt to the firms because if an individual is in debt to their bank, the lender can decide to use PPI compensation to pay off the outstanding figure.

Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said some claims management companies 'operate well below the standards that are expected'

The customer then needs to find money to pay the claims firm – which may be £1,000.

The Citizens Advice research shows that 39 per cent of claims firm customers had no idea that they could have made a claim themselves without charge.

The group wants claims firms and other financial services to be banned from cold calling in order to halt the tide of nuisance calls and protect people from dodgy businesses.

Its chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: ‘Consumers have lost out on billions of pounds worth of compensation because banks were too slow to get a grip on the PPI scandal.

‘By banks originally dragging their feet and providing inadequate redress, claims management companies seized an opportunity to take a up to 25 per cent of people’s compensation for admin work that consumers can do themselves for free.

‘Some claims management companies operate well below the standards that are expected and sometimes outside of the rules. The regulator needs to quickly revoke the licences of firms that are not up to scratch.

‘We’d like to see a ban on cold calling by claims companies which would spare people from nuisance calls and protect consumers from predatory firms.

‘There needs to be a shift in how banks treat their customers. Banks need to look at ways they can make money from saving their customers money, not mis-sell them products.’

Some financial firms are still failing to curb staff bonus schemes to eliminate the risk of another mis-selling scandal, the City regulator warned last night.

In a probe, the Financial Conduct Authority found improvements among major banks, but said one in ten firms with sales teams were not managing the schemes properly.
