The ancestors of Native Americans may have set up home in a region between Siberia and Alaska which contained woody plants that they could use to make fires, according to a new study

It was a mystery how the ancestors of Native Americans survived the Ice Age.

But now a team of international scientists think they might have solved the mystery and it has to do with the ancient people living in a wooded tundra area after splitting from their Asian relatives 25,000 years ago.

The ancestors of Native Americans probably set up home in a region between Siberia and Alaska, which contained woody plants that they could use to make fires, according to a new study.

A group of academics at Royal Holloway, University of London, and the universities of Colorado and Utah analysed fossils to come to this conclusion.

Until now no-one had any idea about where the ancestors of Native Americans spent around 10,000 years before they arrived in Alaska and the rest of North America.

Professor Scott Elias, from the Department of Geography at Royal Holloway said: ‘This work fills in a 10,000-year missing link in the story of the peopling of the New World.’

The experts think that the group of people must have lived on the Bering land Bridge, which is now under the waters of the Bering and Chukchi Seas.

The land bridge and some adjacent regions were not as dry as the rest of Beringia - the region surrounding the Bering Strait, including parts of Russia and Alaska – and the central part where the Native Americans are now thought to have lived, was covered in shrub tundra, which is the most common vegetation in modern Arctic Alaska.

The landscape is dominated by dwarf willow and birch shrubs, mosses and lichens.

Professor Elias said: ‘We believe that 
these ancestors survived on the shrub tundra of the Bering Land Bridge 
because this was the only region of the Arctic where any woody plants 
were growing.’

This map shows the outlines of modern Siberia (left) and Alaska (right) with dashed lines. The broader area in darker green (now covered by ocean) represents the Bering land bridge near the end of the last glacial maximum, a period that lasted from 28,000 to 18,000 years ago when sea levels were low and ice sheets extended south into what is now the northern part of the lower 48 states. University of Utah anthropologist Dennis O¿Rourke argues in the Feb. 28 issue of the journal Science that the ancestors of Native Americans migrated from Asia onto the Bering land bridge or ¿Beringia¿ some 25,000 years ago and spent 10,000 years there until they began moving into the Americas 15,000 years ago as the ice sheets melted.

The theory, now known as the 'Beringia Standstill,' was first proposed in 1997 by two Latin American geneticists and refined in 2007 by a team led by the University of Tartu in Estonia that sampled mitrochondrial DNA from more than 600 Native Americans.

The researchers found that mutations in the DNA indicated a group of their direct ancestors from Siberia was likely isolated for at least several thousand years in the region of the Bering Land Bridge, the now-submerged plain that lies between northeast Asia and Alaska once exposed by a significantly lower sea level.

‘They needed the wood for fuel to make camp fires in this bitterly cold region of the world. They would have used dwarf shrub wood to get a small fire going, then placed large mammal bones on top of the fire, to ignite the fats inside the bones.

‘Once burning, large leg bones of ice-age mammals would have burned for hours, keeping people alive through Arctic winter nights.’

The academics analysed insect and plant fossils extracted from sediment cores taken from the ancient land bridge, to make the discovery. It now lies on the sea floor between 50 and 60 metres below the water’s surface.

Work by Elias and others included the analysis of certain beetle species that live in very specific temperature zones, allowing them to be used as tiny thermometers.

The insects indicated that temperatures there were relatively mild during last glacial maximum that ran from about 27,000 years to 20,000 years ago, only slightly cooler than temperatures in the region today.

The central part of Beringia where the Native Americans are now thought to have lived, was covered in shrub tundra, which is the most common vegetation in modern Arctic Alaska (pictured). The landscape is dominated by dwarf willow and birch shrubs, mosses and lichens.

'The climate on the land bridge and adjacent parts of Siberia and Alaska was a bit wetter than the interior regions like central Alaska and the Yukon, but not a lot warmer,' said Elias.

'Our data show that woody shrubs were available on the land bridge, which would have facilitated the making of fires by the people there.'

The theory, now known as the 'Beringia Standstill,' was first proposed in 1997 by two Latin American geneticists and refined in 2007 by a team led by the University of Tartu in Estonia that sampled mitrochondrial DNA from more than 600 Native Americans.

The researchers found that mutations in the DNA indicated a group of their direct ancestors from Siberia was likely isolated for at least several thousand years in the region of the Bering Land Bridge, the now-submerged plain that lies between northeast Asia and Alaska once exposed by a significantly lower sea level.

The people we know as Native Americans arrived at the continent in three separate great migrations.

Most Native Americans are descended from a small group of migrants that crossed a 'land bridge' between Asia and America during the ice ages 15,000 years ago.

These migrants, known as the 'First Americans', populated most of North and South America.

All the groups originally came from Siberia, Beringia - a land bridge between Asia and America that existed during the ice ages, more than 15,000 years ago.

By studying variations in Native American DNA sequences, a team of scientists found in 2012 that while most of the Native American populations arose from the first migration, two subsequent migrations also made important genetic contributions.

The second and third migrations have left an impact only in Arctic populations that speak Eskimo-Aleut languages and in the Canadian Chipewyan who speak a Na-Dene language.

Eskimos show the most differences, with just 50 per cent of their DNA coming from the 'First Americans'.
