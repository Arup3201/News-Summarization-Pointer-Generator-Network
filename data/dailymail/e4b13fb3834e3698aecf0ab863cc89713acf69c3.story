A Qantas captain received a flood of praise after executing a precarious landing at Sydney airport during a violent storm.

Captain Jerem Zwart and his first officer Lachlan Smale managed a tricky landing at Sydney Airport as Tuesday night's wild storms battered the city, including winds of more than 100 km per hour.

After QF464 touched down after over an hour circling the city,  terrified passengers reportedly burst out in cheers for the pilot.

Captain Jerem Zwart was hailed a hero by the passengers after managing to land in Sydney Airport during the fierce Storm

Storm chaser Tony Harrington, who was on the flight from Melbourne said he needed to get to Sydney that night because a storm was developing.

'I bought a ticket and sure enough we got on a flight,' he said.

'We had to circle for an hour over Goulburn, the storm was developing and then the pilot mentioned there had been a break in between thunder cells, a 15 minute window.'

'One last plane got in, so there was still some time left in the window, our aircraft happened to be sitting right in position to land, just luck the pilot decided to give it go.'

Mr Harrington said the storm was localised so it was only in a vicinity area but according to BOM the storm cell was growing.

'Definitely a wild old storm, the captain said the winds were at 80 klilometres plus, it was amazing to be a guest right in the eye of the storm,' he said.

'We got in, it was pretty rough but these pilots are some of the best in the world and at no time did anyone feel uncomfortable.'

'Few people pretty nervous, some people clenched their seats, the aircraft jumped around a little bit and we didn't expect to land but he (the pilot) stuck it perfectly, it was amazing flying.'

'The pilot did an incredible job, I've been on aircraft where they've just had to abort, pull out, taken away to other interstate airports, but there was nothing dangerous with what he did, under control.'

'We were thrown about but he knew what he was doing, feel sorry for other 18 aircraft that got diverted.'

Mr Harrington who is mostly a Qantas flyer says the airline has a very good track record.

 The Airport was hit by wind gusts of up to 106km/h, causing seven international flights to be delayed and 22 flights to be diverted

'They kept communication and told us what was happening, most settling because fear of the unknown to people, told the truth and people understood it,' he said.

And when they finally touched down on that tarmac, the plane erupted. 

'There was a big clap when we landed, the plane erupted, everyone was so excited, glad not to be diverted to another airport.'

The  storm also saw Sydney's roads flooded as more than 130mm, more than double the month's average

Up to 20cm of snow also fell in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, at a time when most households are preparing for bushfires

Meteorologist Don White, director of Weatherwatch, told Daily Mail Australia the storm was an 'unusual one in ten year event'.

He said wind records were broken, including in Wattamolla, on the site of the Royal National Park, when gusts reached 166 km/h.

'It's also probably the strongest gust recorded in NSW for many years,' Mr White said.

'Mascot reached 170 km/h, which is in the top ten percent of all winds.'
