Natalie Portman has revealed that she loves being a mother and has learned to be less judgmental in the years following the birth of her son Aleph, two.

In a rare interview, given to the Telegraph, the actress, 32, also spoke of inadvertently punching Thor co-star Tom Hiddleston in the face during a fight scene and of her new career behind the camera as she prepares to direct her first film, A Tale Of Love And Darkness, based on a memoir by Israeli author Amos Oz.

Jerusalem-born Portman, who also wrote the screenplay, added: 'It is his coming-of-age story set during the creation of the state of Israel.'

The actress, who is currently renting a house in Tel Aviv with her son and husband Benjamin Millipied, describes the experience as 'exciting and scary' and says she finds living in Israel 'fascinating'.

But it is her son who occupies much of her time, with the actress confessing that she's had to accept that parenting is an individual endeavour with no real rules of engagement.

'I love being a mum,' Portman said. 'I'm less judgmental than before I had a kid. The biggest thing about parenting is that it is a totally different experience for every person.

'Everything is cool, there are no rules - I mean, apart from not hurting your kid. Some people breastfeed until their babies are five, and some don't breastfeed at all.

'There are no rules about what it means to be a feminist, or a good mother. For some, it's going to be right to go back to work, for others it's going to be right to stop working completely.'

Portman is notoriously reticent when it comes to discussing her private life but shows no such qualms when discussing her career - and her penchant for learning.

She famously gave up acting at the peak of her Star Wars fame (she played PadmÃ© Amidala) in 1999 to pursue a degree in psychology at Harvard, saying at the time: 'I'd rather be smart than be a movie star'.

Since completing her degree, she has managed to be both, combining difficult roles such as that of demented ballet dancer Nina in 2011 film Black Swan with more cerebral pursuits.

Career change: Portman's next move will be into directing with new film A Tale Of Love And Darkness

More recently, she has taken roles in more traditional Hollywood blockbusters, including her latest effort, Thor: The Dark World, in which she plays astrophysicist Jane Foster, the love interest of Chris Hemsworth's hammer-wielding god Thor.

The chance to portray a tough female character in a blockbuster proved too much to resist, according to Portman, who also revealed that her favourite part of the on-set experience involved punching Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in the face.

'He acted like he could handle it but I think it actually hurt him!'
