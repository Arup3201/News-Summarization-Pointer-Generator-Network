Gus Poyet believes his former Spurs team-mates Tim Sherwood and Les Ferdinand are the double act who can save Queens Park Rangers from relegation.

The Sunderland boss played alongside the pair at White Hart Lane and expects them to form the new management team at Loftus Road, Sherwood in the dugout and Ferdinand as director of football.

Poyet, whose resurgent Black Cats take on the managerless R’s this evening, said: ‘They (Sherwood and Ferdinand) would be a good partnership. They know each other very well and are strong characters.

‘They have worked together before and that combination would be very natural. It looks like that is going to be case.’

He added: ‘It will be a challenge to keep them up, but after what we did last year anything is possible – and they are in a better situation than we were last season. So why not?’

Poyet shared a midfield with Sherwood, and he said: ‘He was someone you always wanted in your side. When you’re in the tunnel and he’s behind you then you feel secure. He had a difficult situation at Spurs (last season) and did very well there. If QPR chose him then it will be a good choice.’
