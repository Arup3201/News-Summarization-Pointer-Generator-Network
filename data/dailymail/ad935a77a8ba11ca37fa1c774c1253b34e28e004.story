New romance: Tessa Hardy describes the new relationship with BBC newsreader Tim Willcox as ‘casual’

He first made headlines for his affair with his married co-presenter Sophie Long.

And yesterday it emerged that BBC newsreader Tim Willcox has moved on to another blonde with a husband – Tessa Hardy, wife of telecoms multi-millionaire Warren Hardy.

The pair met at a dinner party in 2013, when Mr Willcox, 51, was still with Miss Long, but struck up a relationship shortly after Mrs Hardy, 53, and her husband began a trial separation.

Yesterday friends of Mr Hardy said he was devastated to discover that Mr Willcox had wheedled his way into his wife’s affections when he had been desperately trying to win her back and salvage their 24-year marriage, which produced three children now aged 23, 20 and 17.

A source close to Mr Hardy, 58, said recent business problems had placed a strain on his relationship with his wife – who bears a striking resemblance to Miss Long, 37. 

The friend said: ‘She was very vulnerable when she started a relationship with Tim and he is taking advantage of her.

‘She had only just split from Warren and they were only supposed to be having a short, trial separation.

‘Warren does not think Tim is good for Tessa. She is an attractive, sexy woman and she doesn’t look too dissimilar to Sophie Long, so he clearly has a type. 

'This whole thing has been very hard on Warren. Losing his wife has almost ruined him.

‘He always thought that after the trial separation they would be getting back together.’

Mr Hardy made his fortune from his mobile phone business European Telecom. It was floated on the stock exchange in 1996, and by 2000 he appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List as worth £115million. 

He later founded White Eagle, which developed mobile payment technology.

In 2000, the family built a £7million mansion in Burnham, Buckinghamshire, complete with indoor and outdoor pools and staff quarters.

Mr Hardy’s friend said: ‘Warren worked hard and gave everything to his family. He made sure [Tessa] lived like a princess. Tim won’t be able to provide for her financially. 

Old flame: Mr Willcox and Sophie Long were co-presenters on the BBC. Mr Willcox left his wife of 17 years - with whom he has four children - for Miss Long 

'Tessa has said Tim provides for her emotionally and sexually.’

Mr Willcox became tangled in a similar scandal in 2012, when he left his wife of 17 years – with whom he has four children – for Miss Long.

The pair were presenters on BBC News 24, now renamed the BBC News Channel, and Mr Willcox had been one of the guests at Miss Long’s wedding to childhood sweetheart Will Green just two years earlier. 

A former member of the British Youth Orchestra, he even serenaded the newlyweds on trumpet.

Yesterday Mrs Hardy told the Daily Mail her estranged husband had no grounds for unhappiness about her ‘casual relationship’ with the BBC newsreader, saying: ‘Tim’s divorced and I’m getting divorced. 

'We’re both completely free agents to do what we want when we want.

‘I’ve been separated since April, almost a year, I’m not with my husband. I didn’t leave my husband for Tim, I left because I did. 

'And I didn’t hook up with Tim until several months after I had separated.’

Mrs Hardy added that Mr Willcox had also been separated from Miss Long ‘for ages’ before she became involved with him.

The former housewife now runs Exceptional Pieces, a website selling art and other items.

Mr Willcox did not respond to a request for a comment.
