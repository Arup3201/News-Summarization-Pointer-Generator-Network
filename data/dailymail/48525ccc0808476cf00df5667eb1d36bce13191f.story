The number of workers aged over 50 has hit record levels, with two million more in jobs than just 15 years ago.

It is estimated that by 2020 a third of the workforce will be over 50 as people remain in good health and live longer.

Ministers say older workers have a wealth of skills that are key to strengthening the economy and have told businesses to do more to retain them.

Mature workers: The number of employees aged 50 to 64 has reached 7.7 million

However, charities say the increasing retirement age, family breakdown and cuts to pension schemes have forced some older people to stay in work longer than they had planned.

Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show the number of people aged 50 to 64 in employment has reached 7.7million – even higher than before the recession.

While the number in this age group will have risen, the proportion in work is believed to be higher than at any time before. Pensions minister Steve Webb said: ‘Older workers are not only essential in meeting the long-term demand for labour in our country, they are also an opportunity to add value to business and drive our economy forward.

‘Far from blocking jobs for younger workers, the over-fifties can help to mentor and develop new recruits and apprentices and maximise productivity across the workforce.’

Since October 2011 no employee can be asked to leave a job simply because they have reached the age of 65, which means they can work into their 70s and beyond.

Balancing the books: Cuts to pension schemes are forced some older people to stay in work longer than they planned

Employers were warned by the DWP earlier 
this year that they must hire more mature staff as Britain is ‘running 
out of workers’ ,with 13.5million vacancies predicted in the next decade
– but only seven million young people due to leave education.

Ministers believe the gap can be filled by older people. Around 22 per cent of people are aged over 60, but by 2035 it is expected to rise to 28 per cent.

The figures out yesterday showed the average age at which men leave work has risen from 63.1 in 1993 to 64.8 today. For women it is up from 60.9 to 62.6.

Fading dream: Many more over 50s and 60s are having to put back their retirement plans

For men and women the state pension age will rise to 66 by 2020, and to 67 as soon as 2025 – a decade earlier than planned. A government guide issued to employers says: ‘Older people are the main untapped source of labour: unlike migrants, they already live here, and their numbers are growing.’

Michelle Mitchell, of the charity Age UK, said a number of factors explain the rising number of older workers, including lifestyle, finances and marital status.

She added: ‘It is great to see more people aged 50-plus in the workforce. Older people have a wealth of experience and skills which contributes significantly to businesses and the economy.’

A recent survey found 14 per cent of people did not know when they would ever be able to retire, with those aged 65 and over not expecting to give up work until the age of 71.

But Mr Webb insisted he did not want to promote a culture of ‘work till you drop’.

He said: ‘This is actually enabling people to carry on and in most cases that is good for their wellbeing as well.’

Tests
by the Max Planck Institute in Berlin on more than 200 workers found 
those aged over 65 performed better than those in their 20s in speed and
memory exercises, and their work was more consistent with fewer ‘bad 
days’ at the office.

McDonald’s,
which employs more than 1,000 staff aged over 60, reported 20 per cent 
higher performance at restaurants with older workers.

However, older workers are also staying because of pension cuts
