Kirsty Gallacher says her dad 'would be dead if it wasn’t for the first aid he was given'

So many details surrounding golfer Bernard Gallacher’s sudden cardiac arrest in August last year remain a mystery. Prior to the attack, he had not suffered any symptoms or ill health. And, although the cause – an ‘electrical fault’ – has now been determined, doctors still cannot be sure why his heart stopped beating that day.

But there is one thing on which doctors do agree: Bernard is extremely lucky to be alive.

The 65-year-old, who played in eight Ryder Cups and captained Europe three times in the competition, mercifully remembers nothing of the event. As he stood up to give a speech after dinner at the Marcliffe Hotel in Aberdeen, he ‘just fell over, as if a boxer had landed a punch’.

At first ‘people in the audience thought it was part of my act’, Bernard has recalled since, jokingly.

His next memory came more than a week later in intensive care, with his distraught wife Lesley, and children Laura, Jamie and television presenter Kirsty, at his bedside.

So, yes, many unknowns. Yet there is one certainty: were it not for the swift intervention of those in the audience who knew first aid, Bernard would not have survived.

While acknowledging their incredible good fortune, Sky Sports star Kirsty, 38, still finds it hard to recount the dreadful days watching over her perilously ill father.

And so, as she opens the nominations for the fourth St John Ambulance Everyday Heroes awards, she has issued an impassioned plea: ‘My dad would be dead if it wasn’t for the first aid he was given. These are skills anyone can learn – and everyone should.

‘I have, as luckily Sky offers courses. In fact, I’ve done the course twice. It’s not just cardiac arrests or heart attacks but everyday things such as cuts, burns or choking.

‘The fact is, if you don’t know what to do in a situation like that – whether it’s a family member in need or a stranger in the street – you’re helpless, and all you can do is stand by, watch and do nothing. Imagine how you’d feel if someone died when you could have helped save them.’

Among the audience at the Marcliffe that day was Colin Leyden, who by coincidence trains oil-rig workers in how to use defibrillators. These machines deliver a short electric shock via adhesive pads placed on the chest to restart the heart in the event of a cardiac arrest. A nurse – again, at the event by coincidence – performed chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth, while Mr Leyden, 44, rushed to the hotel gym to retrieve the defibrillator, which is also known as an AED.

Together the pair kept his heart going for more than 20 minutes before paramedics arrived and took over. Bernard’s heart stopped three times – and each time the AED brought him back to life. Earlier this month, Bernard was able to meet his saviour and shake him by the hand.

‘What do you say to the guy who saves your life?’ he has said. ‘Thanks very much, for a start.’

'We all feared the worst': Kirsty and her father Bernard, who suffered sudden cardiac arrest in August last year

In partnership with The Mail on Sunday, the Everyday Heroes awards recognise inspirational individuals who have helped save lives through first aid. From today, you can nominate in a number of different categories, and the winners will be announced at a star-studded ceremony at the Lancaster London hotel, hosted by Kirsty on July 1, 2015.

St John Ambulance chief executive Sue Killen says: ‘Too many people die in situations where first aid could have given them a chance to live. Everyday Heroes gives us a chance to recognise the people who step in when others don’t, or can’t, act.

‘Not only do they have the first aid knowledge but they have shown the courage to help someone who needs them.’

Kirsty remembers the awful moment she discovered her father’s life was hanging in the balance. ‘My mum was in Spain at the time, so I was the first to get the call,’ she explains.

‘It was about 11pm on a Thursday, and I’d just sat down to watch the US Open when my agent rang with the news that Dad was in intensive care. It was just the most horrendous moment.’

Kirsty, Laura and Jamie booked flights to Aberdeen, where their father was in hospital, and arrived there early the next morning.

‘I’d called my mum straight away, and she’d spoken to the consultants. They’d told us all the usual things – that they were doing everything they could, that he was in the best place he could be – but nothing stops you thinking the worst. When I saw him there, my strong, fit dad, covered in tubes and surrounded by machines – nothing can prepare you for that. We thought we were going to lose him.’

It was particularly shocking for the Gallachers, who take pride in their healthy lifestyles. Kirsty says: ‘Dad swam every day and eats really well – he was never overweight, really. My mum is a dietician so makes sure of that. In fact, before the attack he was probably fitter than he’d ever been in his life. We were all brought up to respect our health and bodies.’

She is quick to point out the difference between a cardiac arrest and a heart attack: the latter is usually the result of blockages in the blood vessels around the heart, often the result of poor diet and lifestyle leading to fatty deposits inside them. The lack of blood leads to part of the heart muscle dying, sometimes causing extreme pain – hence the attack.

A cardiac arrest, however, is when the heart simply stops beating. ‘It can happen to anyone,’ Kirsty adds.

Fabrice Muamba retired from football on medical advice, following a cardiac arrest he suffered during an FA Cup tie in March 2012

Footballer Fabrice Muamba survived a cardiac arrest during a match in 2012 thanks to a similar combination of CPR and AED shocks.

If defibrillation is delivered promptly – within two to three minutes of collapse – survival rates as high as 75 per cent have been reported. It was this that undoubtedly saved Bernard, who, after a week intensive care, started to pull through.

Kirsty says: ‘They took him out of the induced coma that they put him in to stop his organs from shutting down, and that was the sink-or-swim moment. My sister and I went back to the hotel where we were staying nearby, but we didn’t sleep a wink.

‘At about 5am, Mum called to tell us Dad was responding. After all the pain, it was the first glimmer of hope we’d had. I believe if he hadn’t been in such good health beforehand, he’d not have fought back like he did.’ Bernard was allowed home after a fortnight in hospital, and his recovery has been relatively rapid.

‘He was told he’d never play golf or swim again, but he’s doing all those things now and he seems fine,’ says Kirsty. The golf star has, like Muamba, been fitted with an implantable defibrillator – a tiny device that delivers a lifesaving electric shock to the heart if it stops again. And in Bernard’s case it has done – twice.

‘The first time it happened, he only told us in passing that he’d fallen off his chair a few days before. Of course we were furious,’ reveals Kirsty. ‘But thankfully he was OK. The second time, last November, I was at their house talking to Mum when we heard this almighty crash. We rushed in to find him on the floor, grey and ashen but conscious.

‘The ambulance came straight away and he recovered well. They adjusted his medication, and there haven’t been any incidents since.’

Kirsty, recently separated from her rugby star husband Paul Sampson, with whom she has sons Oscar, seven, and four-year-old Jude, has since joined her parents in campaigning for the £1,000 defibrillators to be installed at all golf clubs.

According to a recent St John Ambulance survey, an astonishing nine in ten people don’t know what an AED is. And of those who do, almost two-thirds don’t feel they would know how to use one should they witness someone having a cardiac arrest.

‘These new digital machines are foolproof,’ says Kirsty. ‘You open the box and a recorded voice tells you exactly what to do. You can’t do anyone any harm with one either, as they read and analyse the heart’s electrical system and will only give a shock if the heart has stopped. It’s so important people know that.

‘The last thing you want to do is realise, in hindsight, that you could have helped, but didn’t.’

It's time to nominate your hero

Do you know someone who has saved a life by using first aid? St John Ambulance’s annual Everyday Heroes awards recognise the inspirational individuals who do just that – and nominations are now open.

There are nine categories, recognising both individuals and organisations who support training, and the winners will be honoured at a ceremony at the Lancaster London hotel on July 1 next year, hosted by Kirsty Gallacher. The shortlist for the Guy Evans Young Hero Award will be featured in these pages and Mail on Sunday readers can vote for the winner.

Sue Killen, chief executive at St John Ambulance, says: ‘We’re on the lookout for ordinary people who have done extraordinary things by putting first aid into practice when it matters most, or by helping more people learn this vital skill. Everyone has the ability to save a life and we want to celebrate those who are doing just that.

‘Thanks to the first aid knowledge and heroic actions of some incredible individuals, people are alive today who otherwise wouldn’t be. We believe these achievements should be recognised.’

Make your nomination at sja.org.uk/everydayheroes. Closing date: February 28, 2015.
