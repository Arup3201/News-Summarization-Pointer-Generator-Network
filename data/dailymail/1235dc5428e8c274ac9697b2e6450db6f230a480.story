As the heatwave engulfing Britain shows no signs of abating, it seems men are seeking new ways to stay cool in the office.

Rather than sweating it out in a full suit, men are opting for smart, tailored shorts that can be teamed with a shirt and jacket.

This Bermuda type look has become so popular that some shops are reporting over a 200 per cent rise in sales from last year.

John Lewis have seen a risei n sales of over 200 per cent on last years figuresd. Pictured are the McAvoy twill shorts, £45

As temperatures reached the mid-thirties last week, John Lewis reported their best ever week for short sales, with sales of smart shorts up a massive 226 per cent on last year (not entirely surprising, given the cool summer we endured), and 33 per cent higher than the previous bestselling week.

The trend for above-the-knee shorts was a major look at Richard James, Junya 
Watanabe and Raf Simons on the spring/summer 13 catwalks and, since then, tailored shorts have begun surfacing as officewear for overheated city dwellers, whether worn with a 
casual polo shirt or as part of a smart suit.

This trend sees a move away from the short-shorts craze that has been adopted by stars like Joey Essex. Last week high street sales data revealed that demand for men’s shorts that sit at the top of thighs, rather than knees had shot up by 156 per cent in the previous week alone.

The tailored shorts evoke a slightly more sophisticated feel: more elegant post-work cocktails on the terrace than dodgy Wham throwback, and is the sort of look that will see British men looking cool yet chic in the workplace and beyond.

The high street has quickly adapted to cater to this trend and wide ranges of tailored shorts are available at shops from Marks and Spencer to George at Asda.

The current best-selling styles at John Lewis include the private label chino, belted cargo and linen short styles in reds, bright blues and greens – adding a real point of difference and to some, a controversial twist to the ‘office’ look.

Nick Keyte, Head of Menswear Buying at John Lewis, says, ‘Last week alone, shorts sales rose by 52 per cent, week on week.

‘The tailored short offers our male customer a stylish sartorial solution and alternative to the traditional trouser that maintains a level of cool for summer.

‘Our customers are dressing up their shorts with brogues, desert boots and loafers for a more formal look in the office.’
