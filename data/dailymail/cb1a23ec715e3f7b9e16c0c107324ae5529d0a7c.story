Cpl Russell Aston and Anna at their wedding. Some families of the men he died alongside are suing the MoD over the killings, a situation Anna describes as 'embarrassing'

The widow of a British soldier who was one of six military policemen murdered in Iraq has condemned relatives of the victims for attempting to claim compensation.

Anna Aston, whose 30-year-old husband Corporal  Russ Aston was killed ten years ago, said the group legal action against the Ministry of Defence for negligence was ‘wrong and embarrassing’.

She said: ‘I have nothing against these family members and we have all grieved together, but I do find this embarrassing and I have told them so.’

Cpl Aston was one of the six policemen, known as Red Caps, who died when 250 protesters stormed a building in Majar-al Kabir, Maysan province, on June 24, 2003.

Lawyers representing  the families are now suing the MoD after the Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that  such claims for negligence could go ahead.

But Anna, 41, said the claim is unfair on the 750 families of British troops killed in Iraq  and Afghanistan who have  coped silently.

Anna, of Newhall, Derbyshire, who is raising her and Russ’s daughter Paygan, 11, said: ‘It was war and everything goes wrong in war – Russ knew that.

‘That is the same for so many deaths in both wars. What will happen if the families of all these soldiers bring claims? The situation would get ridiculous. I want fairness and less negativity.’

Solicitor Simon McKay, who  is acting for the relatives, said the claim, which may be funded by legal aid, would allege negligence to equip the Red  Caps properly under Article 2  of the European Convention on Human Rights.

An inquest into the death of Russ and the other Red Caps – Simon Hamilton-Jewell, 41,  Paul Long, 24, Ben Hyde, 23,  Tom Keys, 20 and Si Miller, 21  – reached a verdict of  unlawful death but failed to condemn Army commanders  for their actions.

Corporal Russell Aston, 30, was killed alongside five other Royal Military Police officers when a 400-strong mob descended on a police station in Majar al-Kabir in Iraq in June 2003
