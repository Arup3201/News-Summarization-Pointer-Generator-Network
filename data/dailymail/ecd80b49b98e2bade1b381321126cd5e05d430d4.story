Basketball star DeAndre Liggins is facing charges of domestic abuse and battery with a dangerous weapon following an alleged assault on his girlfriend using an Xbox and a fan.

The Oklahoma City Thunder player was arrested on Saturday in connection with the allegations, in which he is accused of carrying out the attack at the home he shares with Jasmine Horton.

In a report on ESPN, Liggins 'punched' Ms Horton, then 'kicked in' the door to a bedroom after she locked herself in.

An affidavit filed on Tuesday claims he then pushed her to the ground, 'stomped on her with his foot' and dropped a fan and Xbox on her head.

The 25-year-old has denied the charges.

The affidavit goes on to say Ms Horton was left with bruises on her chest and back, as well as injuries to her hands and fingers.

The officer who wrote the report noted that the woman had physical signs of injury on her body.

Liggins was charged with domestic assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and domestic abuse in the presence of a minor.

He was released from jail after posting bail of $8,000.

Representing Liggins, lawyer Billy Bock said: 'DeAndre certainly denies ever laying a hand on a female.

'He's hurt by the allegations but knows the truth will come out.'

In a statement, Oklahoma City Thunder general manager Sam Presti said: 'We reiterate the serious nature of this issue.

'We are awaiting further information and will have no further comment at this time.'

Liggins has played for Oklahoma City Thunder since last year.

He played in 39 games last season averaging 1.5 points a game.

Originally from Chicago, he played for Kentucky from 2008 to 2011.
