Amanda Knox's former lover Raffaele Sollecito has reportedly asked her to marry him in a blatant attempt to flee to the United States.

Sollecito made the desperate plea in March, six years after they were both tried in Italian court for the 2007 murder of Knox's roommate Meredith Kercher to avoid serving more jail time, his ex-girlfriend, Kelsey Kay, claimed this week.

The couple, who split years ago, are awaiting potential new convictions in a retrial of their case in Italy, after their previous murder convictions were overturned in 2011.

While Knox said she plans to be a 'fugitive' and remain in the U.S. if re-convicted, Sollecito could face a lengthy prison sentence because he's an Italian citizen.

But Kay, told RadarOnline that he propositioned Knox and her lawyers in an attempt to become a U.S. citizen and dodge potential jail time.

'Raffaele told me that when he had been in Seattle in March, his lawyers and Amanda's lawyers had a meeting where he had proposed the idea of the two of them marrying,' Kay said. 'It would've been natural to the public that the two of them got married.'

But she insisted it would have been purely a marriage of convenience.

'Raffaele proposed the idea to Amanda and her lawyers so that he could obtain citizenship in the United States and stay,' Kay claimed in the RadarOnline interview.

She added that it was important for her that the public know the truth about what happened between Sollecito and Knox, who is in another committed relationship with classical guitarist James Terrano,

'And what had happened — according to him — is in the meeting, he had proposed marriage and that she had told him that she was seeing someone for the past few years and that (it) wasn't an option,' Kay said.

The news comes as an Italian court was urged to ensure Knox and Sollecito serve their sentences, if they are found guilty of the murder Kercher.

Knox has stayed in Seattle while there is an Italian retrial for the murder of the Leeds University student, while Sollecito has been present in Italy.

She and her ex-boyfriend are accused of stabbing Kercher, 21, to death and sexually assaulting her while the young women were studying abroad in Perugia, Italy, in 2007.

Prosecutor Alessandro Crini has requested guilty verdicts and jail 
sentences of 26 years for both defendants. Crini also urged that the court increase Knox's three-year sentence for a slander conviction  
to four years.

Knox and her one-time lover served four years in jail for the murder of Kercher, who was found semi-naked with her throat slit in the flat she shared with Knox.

Both were freed on appeal in 2011 but in March this year Italy's highest court sensationally ordered them to face retrial.

The Kercher family lawyer Francesco Maresca told the court after the concluding arguments in the trial,
that the family trusts the court to reach a fair decision.

A lawyer speaking for Meredith Kercher's family, mother Arline, sister Stephanie and brother Lyle, said they trust the court to reach a fair decision

Maresco said: 'I am sure whatever the decision of the 
court, there will be justice because all of the elements have been 
profoundly evaluated.

'It will be a decision that we 
will accept with absolute serenity.'

The defence and prosecution are both making their summing up arguments before the court begins deliberations on January 30, when a verdict is expected.

During a break, Knox's lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said that any request 
for extradition could be made only after a possible guilty verdict is 
confirmed by Italy's highest court, a process that can take more than a year.

She is currently being tried in absentia and would become a 'fugitive' if she fails to return to serve her sentence should she be found guilty. 

Sollecito's father, Francesco Sollecito, said his son has no intention of escaping justice and that was evident in the fact that he had been present throughout the trial. Precautionary measures could include immediate arrest, house arrest or the confiscation of his passport.

He added that his son has been looking for jobs abroad because he 'hoped the story' would soon end.

Kercher's half-naked body was found beneath a blanket in her locked bedroom on November 2, 2007. She had been sexually assaulted and stabbed multiple times.

Ivory Coast-born Rudy Hermann Guede, is currently serving a 16-year sentence for the murder.

His conviction specified that he did not carry it out alone.
