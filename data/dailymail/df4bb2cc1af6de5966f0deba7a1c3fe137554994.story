Sued: Billionaire Ira Rennert appeared in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday to face an $118million lawsuit

The reclusive owner of one of America's largest homes appeared in court Tuesday to face a civil lawsuit which accuses him of funneling millions of dollars out of a failing business to fund construction of the sprawling 62,000-square-foot Hamptons estate.

Ira Rennert, 80, is being sued by a group of creditors to the now defunct Magnesium Corporation of America, who allege that he caused the metal company to go into bankrupt by unlawfully taking $100million for his personal use. 

However, Rennert's attorneys say there's no way to prove that the money went towards construction of the billionaire's palatial oceanfront estate, and argue that he can't be held responsible for the fluctuating market that prompted the downfall of MagCorp.

Rennert sat in the second row on the first day of the trial in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, and watched as the 10 mostly middle-class jurors were shown pictures of his estate, named Fairfield.   

The elaborate  beach home boasts 29 bedrooms, 39 bathrooms, three dining rooms, three swimming pools, an 164-seat theater, basketball court, gymnasium and two-lane bowling alley.

The industrial magnate, and former friend of convicted ponzi-schemer Bernie Madoff, is expected to testify at some point during the three to four week trial. 

Rennert's involvement with MagCorp goes all the way back to 1989, when his industrial  conglomerate Renco Group bought the metal company for $44million. 

Over the next six years, the company boomed thanks to an 8 per cent growth in the magnesium market. 

Then, in 1996, the company sold $150million in bonds, but instead of investing the profits to update technology and modernize production, creditors say the money was sent back to Renco and onto Rennert personally.

The plaintiffs argue that at least $41million should have remained with MagCorp to keep the company afloat, and that Rennert knew how much the company was struggling when he cashed out the bond funds.

Just five months after the alleged payday, Rennert started another company called Blue Turtles to buy land for his Hamptons estate.

Two months later, Blue Tutrles acquired the massive plot of land in Sagaponack for $11million. Construction began on the property in 1998, which was estimated to cost $100million.

Meanwhile, the magnesium market started to swing in 1996 and in 2001 MagCorp filed for bankruptcy.

Rennert's attorneys say he is not responsible for MagCorp's bankruptcy, and that the company had enough money to make the necessary improvements. 

Bad business: MagCorp allegedly gave $150million to Renco in 1996, and the company's creditors say $100million was then filed onto Rennert personally 

Coincidence? Less than a year later, Rennert purchased the property to build his Sagaponack, New York home

'MagCorp was a financially strong and successful company at the time of all of the distributions in question,' a spokesman for Rennert's company told Crain's New York. 'The only way the plaintiff can get around that core issue of the case is by raising distortions and by caricaturing Mr. Rennert personally, but those distractions do not have legal substance, as our filings prove.'

MagCorp's creditors are now suing for $118million which, with interest, could amount to more than $600million plus punitive damages.  

They charge that Rennert is guilty of fraudulent conveyance, breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. 

Rennert was born in Brooklyn in 1934, and went on to graduate from Brooklyn College before landing a job on Wall Street and finding financial success. 

In addition to his home on Long Island, he also owns an apartment at 625 Park Avenue in Manhattan and is worth an estimated $6.3billion according to Forbes.
