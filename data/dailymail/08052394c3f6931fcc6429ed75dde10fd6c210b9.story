There was a moment here on Thursday when Rory McIlroy tossed a ball towards a young fan in the crowd, only to see the hairy hand of a bearded man intercept it.

‘That was for the kid,’ said McIlroy, fixing the guy with his gaze until the ball had been surrendered to the intended recipient.

McIlroy was that relaxed during what amounted to a near flawless 66; so in control, he was able to engage with spectators while shooting six birdies and 12 pars with a marvellous demonstration of power and precision to lead the 143rd Open Championship.

The question now, however, is whether he can remain as composed when he returns to the lush fairways of Hoylake on Friday afternoon, and so break what has become a nasty habit of messing up his second round.

‘Freaky Friday’ was the term being used in McIlroy’s presence at the press conference he gave after storming to the summit of the leaderboard and he was happy to accept that the statistics don’t lie. In this year alone he is 57 under par for first rounds but nine over for second rounds.  

He even admitted Jack Nicklaus had raised the issue when the two met for lunch near their respective homes in Florida shortly after his second round collapse at Memorial in May.

‘He said: “How the hell can you shoot 63 and then 78?” And then we talked about holding a round together, although not specifically about my previous struggles on Fridays.’

The fact that he was able to smile about such torturous moments — among them the 80 that followed his tournament-leading 63 at St Andrews four years ago — would suggest he is not overly concerned about his ability to remain in contention.

At one point he actually listed his previous Friday travails. ‘I had a bad Friday afternoon at Augusta and then just made the cut,’ he said without the slightest hint of paranoia.

‘And then I started off horrifically at Quail Hollow on Friday afternoon. And then did the same thing at Sawgrass. That’s like three tournaments in a row. That’s when I was conscious of it. I was three-over through nine on Friday at Wentworth and then I was able to get it back in form. And then Memorial obviously was the biggest one.’

He laughed when a reporter suggested he could simply ‘pretend it’s still Thursday’. He also admitted he had been advised to resort to rather more radical tactics. ‘Someone has made a suggestion, but I shouldn’t mention what it is or who it was,’ he said.

Sensibly, McIlroy said it was more a case of managing expectations. ‘Whenever I go out and play on Thursdays there’s not really many expectations,’ he said. ‘But when you go back out on Friday after a good score, you know what you can do on the golf course. I need to approach the round the same way I did here.’ 

McIlroy was magnificent on Thursday, even if he probably should have taken birdie at the first before hitting a sublime approach shot at the second to go one under there instead. That second shot, hit to within a foot of the hole from 191 yards out with a six iron, was, he agreed, among his finest.

Not until the fifth hole did the driver appear, but it was worth the wait; a monstrous 353 yards and almost 20 yards further than anyone had so far managed on that particular fairway. It made getting a birdie on the par five a relatively straightforward exercise for the two-time major winner and was quickly followed by a 12-foot putt on the par three sixth to take him to three under.

The fourth birdie would come at the 10th and not until the 11th would he even find the deep rough that is proving so problematic for some here. A poor second shot left McIlroy chipping from the long stuff but the response was majestic, his ball rolling to within two feet of the pin.

A hole later, completed with a 10-foot putt for birdie number five, and he was in the outright lead. By getting down in two from sand on the 16th he secured his sixth birdie.

At times he was as daring as his royal blue trousers; at others mature beyond his 25 years. In the end it was probably the positioning of his tee-shots that separated him from his even younger playing partners, Jordan Spieth and Hideki Matsuyama.

‘Today was just a real solid round of golf,’ he said. ‘My 63 at St Andrews was a better round of golf, but there were similarities in there.’ Now he just needs to make sure comparisons are not being made with that second round at the home of golf.
