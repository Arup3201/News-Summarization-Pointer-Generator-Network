Bombarded: Michelle Stone was still in hospital taking painkillers when she began receiving emails demanding her opinion on hospital restructuring

A hospital manager who was bombarded with work emails while she was on maternity leave has won £18,000 in compensation.

Michelle Stone, who worked for a private health care chain, was still in hospital taking strong painkillers after undergoing a caesarean when she began receiving ‘insensitive’ messages from the woman covering for her.

One was a demand for help only two days after she gave birth.

The new mother told an employment tribunal she was bombarded with emails from her replacement, Tania Terblanche, for weeks after the birth of her daughter.

When she stopped replying because her baby was ill, Miss Terblanche made a formal complaint accusing her of being ‘unsupportive’.

And when Mrs Stone told her managers she wanted to take her full year’s entitlement of maternity leave, the tribunal heard one of her superiors went ‘ballistic’ and the married mother was branded unprofessional.

Miss Terblanche said it was ‘ridiculous’ for a woman to want to take a year off to look after a baby and ‘effectively started a campaign to destroy [Mrs Stone’s] reputation’, it was claimed.

Mrs Stone said her treatment had a devastating effect on her first year as a mother.

She was under so much stress that her 
health visitor referred her to a mental health worker. In a letter to 
her employer, she said: ‘I have been genuinely concerned that I would 
lose my job and have been made to feel incredibly guilty at taking 
additional maternity leave.’

Failure: Winfield Hospital in Gloucestershire, where Mrs Stone worked, was given a damning judgement by the tribunal panel for the discrimination she faced

The tribunal panel found that the 
43-year-old hospital manager had suffered discrimination and awarded her
£18,000 in compensation.

Mrs Stone was a general manager at 
Winfield Hospital in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, when she became 
pregnant in 2009. She gave birth in February 2010 and remained in 
hospital for several days, and was prescribed strong painkillers.

Two days after the birth she received
an email on her BlackBerry from Miss Terblanche, asking for her views 
on a restructuring programme.

When she did not reply within 48 hours, Miss Terblanche’s assistant phoned her asking her to respond.

The tribunal in Yate, Somerset, said 
it was a criminal offence for an employer to allow an employee to work 
within two weeks of childbirth. Miss Terblanche did not give evidence 
during the three-day tribunal hearing.
