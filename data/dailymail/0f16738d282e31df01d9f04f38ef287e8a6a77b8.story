It's not something you would wish on your worst neighbour. 

A young women was left traumatised after spotting a man break into her back garden in the Narimanovskm district of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, and pull down his trousers.

Suspecting he might be a rapist because he was taking off his clothes, 33-year-old Gyunel Hasanov called the police.

An armed response unit rushed to the scene to find British tourist James Andre Young, 24, relieving himself against the fence with his trousers around his ankles.

Clearly having some explaining to do, Mr Young was questioned by police but then released.

A police spokesman said he was obviously very drunk and had wandered in through what he thought was an open door to relieve himself.

According to the spokesman, the sight of a number of armed officers storming into the churchyard brandishing guns was enough to sober him up and Mr Young apologised for scaring the young woman.
