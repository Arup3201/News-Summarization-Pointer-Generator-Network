Two children are being tested for Ebola after arriving in the UK from Africa, Public Health England has said.

The children, whose ages are not known, are understood to be undergoing tests in Newcastle for Ebola and malaria.

A spokesman for PHE in the North East said it is 'unlikely' the children have the disease but they are being tested as a precaution.

The two children are unlikely to have Ebola, Public Health England said

The children are in the Infectious Disease Isolation Unit at the Royal Victoria Infirmary,one of three units outside of London that can care for patients with infectious diseases such as Ebola. 

They were tested for the deadly virus yesterday after showing viral symptoms. The results were expected later today.

A spokesman for Public Health England said: 'Due to uncertainty about where in Africa the children are from and when they arrived in the UK, as a precaution the children are being tested for Ebola and malaria.

'However the clinical and PHE risk assessment is that Ebola is unlikely. People who have been in contact with the children have been advised to continue as normal.'

A spokesman for Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust refused to comment. 

The Ebola epidemic has killed more than 5,000 people in West Africa. Around 100 people in the UK have been tested for the virus, with all receiving the all clear.
