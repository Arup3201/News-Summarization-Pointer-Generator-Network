Rugby paid tribute to Richie McCaw on Saturday as he captained the All Blacks for the 100th time.

The 33-year-old was presented with a pair of bespoke Welsh Clogau gold cuff-links during a post-match function at the Millennium Stadium.

McCaw led his side to World Cup victory in 2011 and has won three International Player of the Year awards. He was also offered a knighthood, which he turned down.

All Blacks coach Steve Hansen first spotted McCaw when he was playing in a schoolboy match.

‘He was about 17,’ said Hansen. ‘He wasn’t a natural athlete; he had four feet and couldn’t catch a cold. But he had a massive capacity to learn and he always wanted to be better.

‘He was very good over the ball. You could run him over with a tractor and he would still get up and have another go. The thing that’s made him great, outside of his mental strength, is the way his game has continually evolved.’
