Joshua Cooper, 18, allegedly bit off his son's nose because he was frustrated at the baby's crying

A teenage father has been arrested for biting off the nose of his one-month-old son.

Joshua Cooper, 18, of Fairfield, California, allegedly savaged his own baby out of frustration at the infant's crying.

Cooper has been charged with child cruelty and aggravated mayhem and is being held at Solano County Jail, according to CBS.

Fairfield Police received a call shortly after 8am yesterday morning from a 'hysterical' 17-year-old girl, claiming her baby was bleeding from its nose.

Officers found the baby, along with his parents and other family members, at their home on the 1000 block of Alaska Avenue.

The baby was rushed to North Bay Medical Centre, where doctors found part of his nose had been completely severed and he had a possible head trauma.

The baby was transferred to Oakland's Children's Hospital, where medical teams determined one third of the child's nose had been ripped off and that he had a fractured skull and a brain hemorrhage.

It is not yet clear how the baby picked up these last two injuries. The baby is now in a stable condition.

Fairfield Police said in a statement: 'The criminal investigation determined that the infant’s father had bitten the child’s nose off out of frustration from the infant crying. The investigation continues to determine how the infant sustained the skull fracture and brain hemorrhage.'
