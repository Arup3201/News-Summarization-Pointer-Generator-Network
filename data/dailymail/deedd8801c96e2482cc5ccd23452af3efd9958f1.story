Manuel Pellegrini believes it is inevitable that Manchester City will win the Champions League but warns that his club must compete for club football’s biggest prize on an annual basis if they are to be considered among Europe’s great teams.

The City manager, preparing for Tuesday’s home group meeting with Roma at the Etihad Stadium, is convinced that it is only a matter of time before the multi millions invested by the clubs Arab ownership reap the ultimate reward.

But Pellegrini, who performed minor miracles in Champions League campaigns at unfashionable Spanish sides Malaga and Villarreal, knows that is only the beginning of the challenge facing City.

Pellegrini's title in his debut Premier League season has made him a much-loved figure in Manchester

And having set his side a minimum target of a place in the last eight of this season’s competition - one round better than 12 months ago - Pellegrini has outlined the requirement for his club moving forward.

'I am absolutely sure we will do it. It’s very important to win the Champions League. We hope we will win it this year,' said Pellegrini.

'But suppose we do. After that it will be finished. It’s a good achievement but then you must do it every year. Sometimes it will be the final, sometimes the semi-final. How many Champions League do Man United have? Two when Alex Ferguson had his project.

'Winning the Champions League is one of the projects but we must also continue winning Premier League titles and FA Cups and to arrive in the semi-finals and not to be eliminated at the group stage.'

Pellegrini wants his charges to pick up more Premier League titles but knows they need to impact on Europe

Pellegrini, having led City to the Premier League title and Capital One Cup in his debut season in English football, has set high standards since replacing Roberto Mancini. But the Chilean is painfully aware that domestic success is only half the story if his club want to be considered in the same breath as current group rivals Bayern Munich and other European heavyweights.

'If you want to be a really big team you must be involved in both competitions – Europe and in England - and to be a strong team, not only to be comfortable with winning just once,' he said.

'Our target is to be successful in the Champions League and the Premier League, both. Real Madrid or Barcelona or Bayern Munich or the teams playing in other leagues, if they are not involved in one of the competitions it is not good for them.

'They must always be fighting for the domestic title and also in Europe. That is what this club must need to do in the future and it is one of our targets.'

Stevan Jovetic and Samir Nasri will be missing for City against Roma, along with Fernando

Despite his frank analysis of the situation, Pellegrini is also conscious of not placing himself under too much pressure by guaranteeing success this season, especially given the club’s modest efforts in even qualifying from group play in past seasons.

'It’s not the death of the club if we cannot do it this year,' he said. 'We must be very patient. The most important thing is that we are growing in all senses, not just trying to win titles.'

Pellegrini expects to be without the injured Fernando, Stevan Jovetic and Samir Nasri on Tuesday but the tie offers one intriguing potential reunion - that of City loanee Frank Lampard and his former Chelsea and England team mate Ashley Cole, who has since joined the Italian club.
