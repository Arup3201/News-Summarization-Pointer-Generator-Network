A video of a NRA commentator claiming blind people should be allowed to buy and use guns has infuriated gun safety campaigners.

The video, posted on the NRA's website and hosted by commentator Dom Rasco, claims it is an individual's right - blind or not - to bear arms.

He said the blind were capable of using guns because their other senses, such as their hearing, are improved.

Veteran soldier Dom Brasco claimed blind people should be allowed to buy and use guns in the NRA video

The video has been met with disbelief from anti-gun campaigners and activists on social media.

In the video, Mr Rasco asks: 'Do you think because they’re blind that they’re going to start shooting in every direction and kill everyone?

'Fact is, it’s been proven that people that lack vision have an increased awareness of their hearing and spatial surroundings.'

He goes on to add: 'As a combative expert, let me ask you a question. Do you think you need to see where you are shooting if somebody is on top of you trying to kill or rape you, while their hands are slowly squeezing your neck and they’re yelling, "I’m going to kill you?" I didn’t think so.'

In response to the video, Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, posted on Twitter: '@NRA news contributor makes the case for allowing blind people to buy guns.

'Should we let blind people drive too?'

Others on the social networking site also vented their anger at the video, claiming the NRA didn't want to miss out on selling guns to 'an entire demographic'.

Mr Rasco is a veteran U.S. Navy Seal.

The video is prefaced by a disclaimer stating the commentator's views are not necessarily those of the NRA's. However, the video is hosted on the NRA's website.
