Morale among engineers at Twitter has become low as the micro blogging site is struggling to define itself and justify its huge valuation, an insider has claimed.

The mood among employees at Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco is said to have dropped as pressure intensifies on the company to become more profitable before the technology bubble bursts.

Twitter now boasts a valuation of $8 billion, but industry experts have noted that the social network 'is still trying to figure out what it is', with disillusionment said to have crept in among staff.

Mood change: Morale is said to have dropped at Twitter's San Francisco office as the site struggles to define itself

The micro blogging site is 'still trying to sort out its product problems', according to one expert.

Morale is said to have become low among engineers who are disappointed the company has not innovated enough or introduced more new features.

Recent figures suggest that Twitter now has up to 100 million users worldwide, sending 230 million 'tweets' a day.

Despite this, the micro blogging site is still dwarfed in second place by the social networking giant that is Facebook.

While Twitter can boast a huge fanbase, it still lags behind the 750 million users of Facebook worldwide, and is now facing competition from Google+, which has an estimated user base of 30 million.

According to Joe Hagan, of New York magazine, an analysis of the company showed that there is mounting pressure to make Twitter more profitable.

Bosses are also keen to address the gap in people who sign up to the site but do not actively tweet themselves.

As a medium so popular with hundreds of celebrities round the world, many people sign up to Twitter just so they can keep tabs on their favourite stars, rather than actually tweet themselves.

Recent analysis suggests as many as 40 per cent of Twitter users don't actively tweet.

Hagan's article states: 'The intense 
pressure to convert Twitter into a profitable business, and before a 
tech bubble pops, is palpable here. 

'And it’s happening as the company 
struggles with an interlocked set of existential questions, starting 
with the most basic one possible: What is Twitter?'

Cashing in: Twitter co-founder Evan Williams is quoted in the New York magazine analysis as saying that the site's value is only a 'fraction' of what it could be

Mr Hagan's article goes on to state 
that in terms of audience, talent and advertisers, Twitter is not 
'anywhere near' where it should be.

He goes on to claim that the site is struggling to 'make good on the intense expectations under which it is labouring'.

Mr Hagan adds: 'A person with close 
ties to the company says the morale inside Twitter, especially on floor 
three, has been low.

The article in New York magazine claims Twitter is struggling to justify its valuation

'In
the hothouse of Silicon Valley, engineers are the coin of the realm, 
and what they want, in addition to a financial stake, is to put their 
stamp on a winning company, even if it means working for one of the 
thousands of tiny startups developing applications for Facebook or 
Google.'

The social networking giant is 
thought to have hired hundreds of new engineers in an effort to cash in 
on its worldwide stance as a 'cant-miss tech company like Facebook, or 
even Google'.

But 
despite this, Mr Hagan quotes Twitter co-founder Evan Williams as 
saying: 'We’re a fraction of the way into creating the value and growing
the size of the service we know it can be.

'It’s precarious, and it’s always precarious when you’re in that position.'

Despite bringing in a rumoured $150m (£93m) in advertising last year, pressure is said to be mounting on Twitter to define itself and become more profitable
