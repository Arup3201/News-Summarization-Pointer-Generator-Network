Senior Tory MPs plan to make an unprecedented formal complaint to Speaker John Bercow over what they see as his bias and ‘hatred’ for Conservatives.

Leaders of the party’s 1922 Committee – the ‘men in grey suits’ – are expected to speak to Mr Bercow after his ‘appalling’ treatment of David Cameron this week.

The Commons Speaker rebuked Mr Cameron at Prime Minister’s Question Time for describing Ed Miliband as a ‘conman’, saying the term was ‘unparliamentary’.

He was also seen to smirk when the Prime Minister stood to speak early by mistake. Backbenchers said he permitted ‘a wall of noise’ from Labour, while turning on a handful of Tory hecklers.

Senior sources suggested that the word conman was not unparliamentary. MPs may not call each other liars, but can  say that an opponent has ‘misled’ the Commons.

A small group of Tories has long criticised Mr Bercow’s approach, but it is unprecedented in modern times for senior MPs to complain formally of bias. A member of the 1922 executive said that feeling is so strong it is ‘a safe assumption’ a ‘delegation’ will call on the Speaker.

One Conservative, who is generally supportive of Bercow, said: ‘It was the first time I have seen the vast majority of Tory MPs outraged.

‘Bercow’s face was a face of rage. There was simply contempt in his eyes. You shouldn’t address the Prime Minister like that.

‘This was anger and dislike directed at the PM. It is clear that he hates him personally. We knew he could be biased but this went way beyond what was acceptable.’

Mr Cameron had told Mr Miliband: ‘It simply is the politics of the conman to pretend that you can freeze [energy] prices when you’re not in control of global energy prices.’

Mr Bercow broke in: ‘Let me  just say, I let it go the first time,  the word “conman” is frankly  unparliamentary. The Prime Minister is a man of great versatility in  the use of language – it’s a bit below the level.’

The Speaker is no stranger to Commons controversy. Last year he attacked health minister Anna Soubry, saying she ‘thinks her views are relevant, but we are not interested’.

In June, Tories accused him of failing to discipline a Labour MP who allegedly made an offensive gesture to Chancellor George Osborne.

Earlier this week, he stopped Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt from talking about Labour’s NHS record.

Mr Bercow’s spokesman said: 'If Members have any concerns and raise them with Mr Speaker, he will respond appropriately.'
