Politicians who wore T-shirts for a feminist campaign were branded ‘chumps’ yesterday as it emerged the product was made by women paid just 62p an hour.

The charity behind the £45 item launched an urgent investigation into reports they were produced in a ‘sweatshop’ in Mauritius.

The shirts boast the slogan ‘This is what a feminist looks like’ and have been worn by Ed Miliband, Harriet Harman and Nick Clegg.

The shirts were made in a factory on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius where workers said: 'How can this T-shirt be a symbol of feminism when we do not see ourselves as feminists? We see ourselves as trapped' 

But Conservative MP Conor Burns said the Mail on Sunday’s report into working conditions for the women who made the shirts was ‘hugely embarrassing’ for the two party leaders and for women’s rights campaigner Miss Harman.

Critics voiced anger over the apparent hypocrisy, saying the politicians’ T-shirts should carry the slogan ‘This is what an utter failure looks like’.

Twitter user Simon Bull wrote: ‘Pro-feminist T-shirt costs £45?! More like “This is what a chump looks like”.’ Tory MP Ben Wallace retweeted a picture of Harriet Harman wearing the T-shirt, with the words: ‘This is what someone supporting Third World sweatshops looks like.’

Fellow Conservative MP Caroline Dinenage also took aim at the deputy Labour leader, saying: ‘Who angers me most is Harriet Harman who sat smug at Prime Minister’s Questions flaunting her £45 T-shirt.

‘As if we take a single step closer to equal pay for the same job by wearing an ugly, over-priced T-shirt.’

David Cameron triggered a row last week when he refused to wear one of the shirts, which were made for high street fashion chain Whistles in aid of women’s rights group the Fawcett Society. Both said they would investigate the ‘sweatshop’ claims.

The Mail on Sunday reported the shirts were made in a factory on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius where women workers are paid only 6,000 rupees a month – the equivalent of around £120.

Taking home just a quarter of the country’s average monthly wage, the women also sleep 16 to a room in spartan dormitories between shifts, it was reported.

A female worker told the newspaper: ‘How can this T-shirt be a symbol of feminism when we do not see ourselves as feminists? We see ourselves as trapped.’

Fayzal Ally Beegun, president of the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers’ Union, said: ‘The workers in this factory are treated very poorly and the fact that politicians in England are making a statement using these sweatshop T-shirts is appalling.

‘It would take a woman working in the factory nearly two weeks just to buy one shirt. What is feminist about that?’

Nick Clegg was also pictured looking jolly in the T shirt produced by women paid just £120 a month 

Critics last night questioned the high price of the controversial pro-feminist T-shirts, which have gone on sale for £45 despite costing only £9 to produce.

Others also asked why the tops were only available up to a size 16.

As well as the T-shirts, a £55 clutch bag, an £85 sweatshirt and an iPhone cover costing £30 were also part of a range of items for sale at high street chain Whistles, it was revealed yesterday.

Simon Bull, who has called people who wear the T-shirts ‘chumps’, tweeted: ‘It’s not even what a good T-shirt looks like, is it?’ Helen Purves accused the retailer of an ‘epic feminism fashionista fail’.

She tweeted: ‘This is what a feminist looks like: thin... And before anyone says size 16 is big, it’s the UK average.’

Women’s rights group the Fawcett Society, which is behind the campaign, said pricing and sizing had been decided by Whistles. The charity’s original T-shirts, which it has sold for eight years, remained on sale on its website for £15.

The Whistles range appeared unavailable on its website last night, suggesting it had either sold out or been withdrawn. The firm declined to comment.

The shirts are on sale in Whistles, popular with the Duchess of Cambridge, and the campaign has been backed by fashion magazine Elle. Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch and Harry Potter actress Emma Watson modelled the shirts for this month’s ‘feminism’ edition of the magazine.

Student Shereen Shafi sent a Twitter message to Miss Watson and the magazine, asking: ‘Does indentured female labour look like feminism to you too?’

The row is particularly embarrassing for Labour, which has campaigned for companies to take greater responsibility for their supply chains.

Backbench MP Mr Burns added that politicians who wore the T-shirt now look ‘ridiculous’. And Scottish Labour leadership candidate Jim Murphy told BBC Radio 5live it was ‘disappointing’ that there weren’t better checks.

However, Labour sources said Mr Miliband was not embarrassed to have worn the T-shirt, and said it was the responsibility of those running the campaign to carry out the checks.

A party spokesman said it was ‘happy’ to support the campaign. Conservative MP Miss Dinenage said there was ‘egg on faces all round’. She added: ‘On the politicians, who couldn’t have foreseen how this PR gimmick would unfold; the Fawcett Society, who are very unforgiving of these kind of errors of judgment in others; Whistles, who claim to be a company with ethical values; and Elle magazine whose “feminist” issue kicked this off in the first place – when they promote wholly unachievable ideals of women’s bodies all year round.’

The Fawcett Society said it had been assured by Whistles that the T-shirts would be produced ethically in the UK.

When it realised they were made overseas, the charity was told the factory, owned by Compagnie Mauricienne de Textile, had ‘world class’ social and ethical policies. Fawcett Society deputy chief executive Eva Neitzert said she was ‘disappointed’ by the new claims and will insist the T-shirts are withdrawn if there is ‘concrete’ evidence of mistreatment.

Whistles said it had launched an investigation, adding: ‘We place a high priority on environmental, social and ethical issues’. It said it carried out regular audits of its suppliers and said the Mauritius factory conformed to ‘the highest standards’.
