The incredible moment flying sheets of ice flew off a Texas apartment building and crashed down onto a parked car has been caught on video.

The video was shot in Plano, Texas, where extreme winter weather has left the city covered in white powder.

The woman shooting the footage is heard saying: 'Holy freakin moly' as the avalanche of ice is seen sliding from the roof of her building.

The seemingly never-ending storm that coated parts of Texas in ice struck with unexpected force on the East Coast over the weekend, blanketing some spots in a foot of snow, grinding highways to a halt and conditions are expected to remain Arctic well into Monday afternoon from Missouri to Maine.

More than 22,000 Dallas-area homes and businesses were still without power on Monday, according to electric utility Oncor. That was down from 270,000 on Friday. Dallas students got a snow day.

More than 1,300 flights Monday were already canceled, the greatest share from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, which was still reeling from the effects of the ice storm that brought North Texas to a standstill.

About 650 people were stranded there Sunday night, down from Saturday night when about 2,000 travelers were stranded, spokesman David Magana said.

North Texas was shivering under below-freezing temperatures over the weekend - left behind after the ice storm that knocked out power lines, leaving some 267,000 customers in without power at the height of the storm, according to utility provider Oncor.

Nationally, there have been more than 6,100 flight cancellations since Saturday, according to FlightStats.com, including more than 2,800 by American or its American Eagle regional airline. American emerged from bankruptcy protection and merged with US Airways on Monday.Â
