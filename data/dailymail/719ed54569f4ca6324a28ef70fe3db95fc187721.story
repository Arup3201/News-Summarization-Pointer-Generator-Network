Former Forest Green Rovers manager Dave Hockaday has been named as the new head coach of Leeds United.

The two-year deal at Elland Road comes after Brian McDermott left at the end of May, and the 56-year-old's first game will be against Millwall on the opening day of the new Championship season.

The former Blackpool and Swindon right-back has been out of the game since October last year after spending four years as boss of Conference outfit Forest Green, before leaving by mutual consent.

Hockaday, who left Forest Green after losing seven out of eight league games, will have former Leicester City midfielder Junior Lewis as his assistant.

'I wasn't surprised to get the call because I'd spoken to lots of people and when I met the president (Massimo Cellino) and he talked it was very obvious he knew what he was talking about,' Hockaday said about getting the Leeds role.

'It happened and it seemed right and he offered me the job and I accepted.'

Hockaday, who said the club had players lined up to strengthen the squad and that Ross McCormack would not be sold, added:

'I can eulogise as long as I want about a club the size of Leeds, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.

'I've been given a great opportunity and I'm going to take this opportunity with both hands and one thing nobody can ever accuse me of is a lack of hard work and I believe I'm a good coach.

'The president believes I'm a good coach and people out there who have obviously recommended me believe I'm a good coach and I'm going to prove that.'

A statement on the club's website said Hockaday 'will assume overall responsibility for the coaching staff and first team playing squad with immediate effect'.

Leeds' Italian owner,
 Massimo Cellino, who completed his takeover on April 7, faced an angry backlash from fans on Monday.

It was due to the majority at Elland Road wanting Gary McAllister to be named for the hot-seat.

It is feared Hockaday may not have enough experience to take on such a role at the former First Division champions, despite a C.V. covering 20 years of playing and 14 years of coaching.

Hockaday began his coaching career after Watford allowed him to take charge of their U18 side.

He cut his teeth with the youngsters for five years, before moving on to the first team, assisting Watford in securing Premier League promotion in 2005 from the Championship.
