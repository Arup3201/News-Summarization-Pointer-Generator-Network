A 15-year-old girl has been horrifically murdered in Houston in what appears to be a satanic ritual killing. She was found with an upside-down cross carved into her stomach and religious items placed in a circle around her partially naked body.

Police say Corriann Cervantes was abducted, then raped and bashed in the head with the lid of a toilet tank and an ashtray until she died. She was kidnapped on Wednesday, but her body was not found until Saturday morning. 

Police arrested 17-year-old Jose E. Reyes and a 16-year-old classmate of Corriann's, who knew her from the alternative high school they both attended in Clear Lake, Texas. 

Sick smile: Jose Reyes smiled at the court cameras on Monday as he appeared on murder charges

Brutal: Corriann Cervantes, 15, was taken to a vacant apartment, where she was raped and brutally murdered, police say

Reyes confessed to the horrific crime and said he had killed Corriann so that his younger friend could 'sell his soul to the devil,' according to KTRK-TV.  

In court on Monday, Reyes looked directly into the camera and smiled. He faces adult capital murder charges. A judge ordered him held without bail.

The 16-year-old is being charged with capital murder as a juvenile. His name was not released.

Corriann was found in a vacant apartment about 4am Saturday - three days after she was kidnapped.

One of the neighbors who found her body said there were religious items placed around her body, according to KTRK.

A police report says she was found half naked with her clothes torn and an upside-down cross carved into her stomach. Her body showed signs that she had been violently raped.

Motive: Reyes claims he killed the girl so his friend could 'sell his soul to the devil'

A broken toilet tank cover was found around her head. 

Detectives believe the teens savagely beat her with the lid and an ashtray.

Reyes confessed that the pair sexually assaulted Corriann. When she tried to leave the vacant apartment, they grabbed her by the arms and pulled her back in again, according to police.

Reyes was arrested Sunday after he told the horrific details of the crime to a family member, who called police.

Victim: Corriann was found murdered three days after she went missing from her Texas home

The 16-year-old was arrested at school on Monday - the same school he attended to Corriann.

Classmates were shocked to hear about Corriann's horrific murder on Monday and counselors were made available to her friends at school.

Friends left an outpouring of grief on her Facebook page - and rage for her suspected killers.

'RIP prayers to her family and friends. God will take her into his arms to comfort her and she is smiling down from heaven now. Hope the ones who did this suffers for it!' one mourner wrote.
