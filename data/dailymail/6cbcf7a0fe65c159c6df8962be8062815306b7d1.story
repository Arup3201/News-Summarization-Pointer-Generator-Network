A Russian historian who dug up the bodies of 150 dead little girls in order to mummify them and dress them up in stockings for 'birthday parties' is not mentally fit to stand trial, a judge has said.

Anatoly Moskvin, 46, from the city of Nizhny Novgorod in central Russia, was arrested in 2011 after it emerged he had dug up at least 150 corpses of girls aged between three and 12.

He then took the bodies home and turned them into a grisly collection of mummies, dressing the bodies and skeletons in stockings and dresses and even making one look like a teddy bear.

Moskvin, who speaks 13 languages and was described in court as a 'genius', gave the mummified corpses names and organised birthday parties for them. All of little girls had died years earlier.

A video made by Moskvin and found at his apartment by investigators showed a corridor cluttered with wedding dresses and bright, colourful clothes.

In a room the camera zoomed in on the faces of the girls' faces, wrapped in light beige fabric.

A voiceover on the video said: 'These dolls are made of mummified human remains.'

Police said Moskvin also compiled up-to-date information about the lives of each girl he had dug up and printed off instructions on a computer for how to produce dolls out of human remains.

His macabre obsession was discovered when his parents visited him after returning from holiday.

A prosecutor spokesman said: 'After three years of monitoring him in a psychiatric clinic it is absolutely clear that Moskvin is not mentally fit for trial.

'He will therefore be kept for psychiatric treatment at the clinic.'
