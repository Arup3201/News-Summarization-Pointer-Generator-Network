Since the Sound of Music holidaymakers from around the world have wondered what it would be like to spend a night in a convent.

They could soon find out as a historic Italian convent has been put up sale in Tuscany with planning permission to transform it into a impressive hotel or conference centre.

Although the sale price of £13million (€18million) may seem  steep, it is a bargain price as Giaccherino has 50 bedrooms, 40 bathrooms, a church and a library. 

A convent, more than 80 times the size of the average UK home, has been put up for sale for the price of a three-bedroom flat in London

Giaccherino, in Tuscany, boasts a staggering 50 bedrooms, 40 bathrooms, a church, a library and even an olive grove

The huge estate has 78,000 square feet of accommodation, which is 85 times the size of the average new home in the UK.

The magnificent 15th century property also comes complete with an olive grove, cloisters, beautiful wall frescoes and a vast woodland which covers nearly 22 acres.

There is even a colourful history to go with the Giaccherino, which became a valuable centre of theological studies during the 17th century. 

The holy dwelling was originally used for a community of Franciscan friars of the Primitive Observance.

On completion of the property in 1414, Pope Innocent VII handed the property to the monks and over the years it has been used as an oratory and hospital for pilgrims.

Giaccherino became a valuable centre of theological studies during the 17th century and has two cloisters with stunning frescoes

The property is listed with the Sotheby's International Realty as an opportunity for one of the most impressive private homes in Europe, or as a possible hotel or conference centre. 

Fulvio Biagioli, sales manager at Tuscany Sotheby's International Realty, said: 'This convent is of real historical significance and any private buyer would have to have a strong passion for restoration and history.

'The original frescoes offer a once in a lifetime opportunity to live amongst the works of the Florentine masters and the olive groves and land could be turned into some of the finest private grounds in the country.

 'If a private individual was to buy the convent they could create one of the most incredible private homes in the world.'

Outside there is an olive grove that is positioned at the bottom of the property and there is a private, 22-acre woodland

The price indicates just how powerful the London housing market is, as the convent is just £500,000 more than a penthouse apartment in the new Galliard development, Chilterns, in Marylebone. 

David Galman, sales director at Galliard Homes, said: 'It always boils down to location, location, location. London is the best city in the world for a whole number of reasons.

'You can have the penthouse, or you can spend the £13million on a castle or convent in Italy.

'But in five years the convent will be worth the same or less, while the penthouse will be worth more.' 

The Italian property could become one of the most impressive private homes in Europe or be transformed into a hotel or conference centre
