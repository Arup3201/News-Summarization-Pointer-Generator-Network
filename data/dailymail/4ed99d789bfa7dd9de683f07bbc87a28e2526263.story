Republicans will meet
July 18-21 next year in Cleveland, Ohio, to nominate their 2016
presidential candidate, the party said on Wednesday. 

The party's presidential nomination convention will take place more
than a month earlier than it in did in 2012 and past election cycles.

In the announcement, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, on the verge of an election to a third term as the party's leader, said the 2016 convention would be held in July to allow 'access to crucial general election funds earlier than ever before to give our nominee a strong advantage heading into Election Day.'

The party's 2012 convention was held Aug. 27-30 in Tampa, Florida. Its presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, lost the general election to President Barack Obama. 

Before settling on July for its confab, the RNC said it could move up it formal nominating process by more than two months to June.

An earlier convention date will shorten the presidential primary, ensuring less intra-party bashing before the general election, and give the eventual nominee more time to campaign against the Democratic opponent.

Republicans selected Cleveland last year as its convention
site for 2016. Ohio is a crucial swing state in presidential elections.

Democrats have yet to name a 2016 convention site, but they are also considering Ohio for their confab. The remaining candidates are Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Columbus, Ohio, and Brooklyn, New
York.

Republicans last met in Cleveland in 1936, nominating
Kansas Governor Alf Landon, who was soundly defeated by
President Franklin Roosevelt in the November election. 

The
party's convention was also held in Cleveland in 1924, when
President Calvin Coolidge was nominated. He won the general
election later that year. 

Members of the RNC are meeting this week in San Diego, California, where Priebus is expected to easily win election to another term. 

He will be the first RNC chairman to stay on for a third election cycle in more than 25 years.
