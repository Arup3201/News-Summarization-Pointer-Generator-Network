Lewis Hamilton’s possible return to McLaren inched closer when his former boss Ron Dennis hinted he is considering re-signing his former protégé.

McLaren are waiting to see how the fractious relationship between Hamilton and Nico Rosberg plays out at Mercedes, with the British driver on the short-list of three star drivers that also includes Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel.

‘No-one could have predicted the tension inside Mercedes-Benz,’ said Dennis. ‘We can all imagine a range of scenarios that could see one of those drivers on the market by the end of the year.’

Dennis, who is famous for so-called ‘Ron-speak’ – his circumlocutory style of expression – added: ‘You are trying to understand what is available, and then you take a decision.’

It is understood that putative talks between McLaren representatives and Hamilton’s people have taken place. Eric Boullier, McLaren’s racing director, is even keener on signing Hamilton than Dennis, who fell out with the driver towards the end of his spell with the team.

With Alonso, McLaren’s No 1 target, having last week reiterated his desire to stay at Ferrari, Hamilton is a strong contender to take the place of one of the two existing McLaren men, Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen.

It would be a bold move by Hamilton to leave Mercedes, one of the best-funded teams in the sport and the fastest, but his disillusionment could be so fierce if we were to lose the title that he might well feel the urge to leave.

There is also the possibility that Mercedes could dispense with him, to end the tense rivalry between Hamilton and Rosberg.

Even though Mercedes have tried to manage their warring drivers, the team boss Toto Wolff warned this week that they could suspend or sack either of them if there was any repeat of their crash at the last race in Spa a fortnight ago.

‘We would have to take decisions and take the consequences of having a different line-up,’ he said. ‘If we are not able to manage the two of them following the Mercedes-Benz spirit then we need to admit that.’
