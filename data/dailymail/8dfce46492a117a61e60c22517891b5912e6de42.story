An electrician has been ordered to pull down the £10,000 security fence he built after he was burgled ten times in two months - because it might scare motorists.

Graham Jaggar, 51,  built the barrier after thieves relentlessly targeted his home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. 

But he now claims council chiefs have told him to remove the fence - because it could pose a hazard to drivers. 

Graham Jaggar has been ordered to pull down the £10,000 security fence after he was burgled ten times in two months - because it might scare motorists

He said: 'Over the last few years I've had around £30,000 worth of stuff stolen by these idiots, it's just a scandal.

'It's mostly been expensive tools from this house, which means I can't work, and building materials.

'They have also stolen model aircrafts worth a few thousand pounds and even my children's toys from the garden.

'From my old house, which I left because I thought I would be more secure in another property, I had a boat stolen, two cars, a motorbike and my daughters scooter.

'They have even stolen four or five wheelie bins - and one of them was full of rubbish.

The boat had around £4,000 of work done on it.

'I reckon I have been bugled around 20 times over the past six years.'

Self-employed Mr Jaggar built the six foot fence last year after his electrics business was threatened for months by the burglars.

Mr Jaggar, 51, built the barrier after thieves relentlessly targeted his home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. But he now claims council chiefs have told him to remove the fence - because it could pose a hazard to drivers

He said the fence had been up for almost a year but the council contacted him a couple of months ago to tell him about the complaint and ordered that the fence is amended by January 7

But now, he said a neighbour's complaint that it causes a blind spot has put his house at risk of being targeted again.

He said he was given 'verbal planning permission' by a man from the council who has since left. 

He said: 'The fence means there is a very small blind spot, but there are hazards everywhere in the roads so all it takes is caution and common sense.

'It causes a brief blind spot, for the blink of an eye, when you come out of the junction.

'I've not had any burglaries since putting it up 12 months ago but now I might have to spend even more adjusting it.

'I could be left with a bill of thousands of pounds after changing the fence to what the council want.

'I can't take it down - I've been burgled so many times the insurance won't even pay out anymore.

'It's ridiculous and a scandal, why can't anyone use some common sense?'

He added that the fence has been up for almost a year but the council contacted him a couple of months ago to tell him about the complaint and ordered that the fence is amended by January 7.

Mr Jaggar estimates has now spent around £12,000 in total on security - including the fencing, CCTV, an electric gate, walls and bushes to protect his home

He claims his grandchildren are 'terrified' to visit the house for fear of burglars, added: 'They've given me two weeks to get it sorted, which is impossible at this time of year.

'It's so much hassle, someone is just being vindictive about it. It's going to cost a fortune and it would be an eyesore.

'I could plant ten foot conifers around this house and get away with it, there's no common sense whatsoever.

'I put this up about a year ago and had no trouble, so I don't know why neighbours are complaining now.'

Mr Jaggar, who lives with partner Stephanie, 56, made the headlines in 2013 when a sign outside his property warning against thieves.

He estimates has now spent around £12,000 in total on security - including the fencing, CCTV, an electric gate, walls and bushes to protect his home.

He said: 'The council just won't see any sense. They have cocked up and I've been left to to cough up the costs - I need to protect my house.

'The fence also acts as a safety guard because so many children climb on the three foot wall it sits on and fall off, then I'm the one that gets the blame.'
