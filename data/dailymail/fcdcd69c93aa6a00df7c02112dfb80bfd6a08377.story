It may look uncannily like a pristine beach just moments after a child with a bucket and spade has descended, but in fact this if the surface of Mars - where Curiosity has begun digging in earnest.

Commands will be sent to Curiosity today instructing the rover to collect a third scoop of soil from the 'Rocknest' site of windblown Martian sand and dust where the rover is currently. 

It comes after engineers decided to abandon one scoop after spotting shiny material they believe may have fallen off the rover.

Engineers have also been giving Curiosity's chemical analysis instrument a dust bath.

Its robotic arm scooped a sample and shook the dust and grains over the scooper’s metal surfaces.

The ‘used’ soil was then unceremoniously dumped.

The is being done to scrub away any terrestrial contaminants, such as fine layers of oil that may have settled on the instrument after leaving NASA’s clean rooms.

Manipulating the rover's robotic scoop, engineers sent commands to simply dump the scoop, before digging for another one.

However, they are now interested in signs of another shiny material on the martian surface - believed to be of Martian origin.

Pending evaluation of this, the engineering team say a sample from the scoopful is planned as the 
first sample for delivery - later this week - to one of the rover's 
internal analytical instruments, the Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) 
instrument.

A later scoopful will become the first solid sample for 
delivery to the rover's other internal analytical instrument, the Sample
Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument. 

The rover's second scoopful, collected
on Sol 66 (Oct. 12), was intentionally discarded a day later due to 
concern about particles of bright material seen in the hole dug by the 
scooping.

Other small pieces of bright material in the Rocknest area 
have been assessed as debris from the spacecraft, Nasa said.

'The science team did 
not want to put spacecraft material into the rover's sample-processing 
mechanisms,' it said in a statement.

'Confidence for going ahead with the third scooping was based
on new assessment that other bright particles in the area are native 
Martian material.

'One factor in that consideration is seeing some bright
particles embedded in clods of Martian soil.

The rover has also spotted some unique shiny objects in the soil which the team hope to analyse. Although some particles nearby were explained as debris from the rover, Nasa believes these images show martian material

A clod of soil near the top center of the image above contains a light-toned particle.

The observation that the particle is embedded in the clod led scientists to assess this particle as Martian material, not something from the spacecraft as they had first assumed.

This assessment prompted the mission to continue scooping in the area, despite observations of a  despite observations of a few light-toned particles in the area being scooped.

Researchers have also taken more pictures of a piece of material discovered near the rover.

It initially baffled Nasa, but it is now believed to be a small piece of plastic dislodged during the rover's trip and landing on the red planet.

The rover also sent back new high resolution pictures of a piece of debris engineers now believe fell from the rover
