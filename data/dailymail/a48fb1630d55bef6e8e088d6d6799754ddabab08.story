On the run: Vladimir Avdeyev was jailed for killing two migrants but escaped from high security prison

A former paratrooper who was jailed for butchering two migrant workers but escaped after he dug a 30-metre long tunnel has been caught after four months on the run.

Vladimir Avdeyev, 38, was jailed for 25 years in 2006 for brutally killing two migrant workers and badly disfiguring four others in a gruesome attack near to Irkutsk, Siberia.

In May, Avdeyev escaped a high security 
jail near Markovo, north of Irkutsk, by digging a 30-meter long tunnel under the facility with two other murderers and a robber.

Residents of the city were warned to stay in their homes after the violent man escaped.

At the time, a former comrade of his said: 'He can kill any number of people with his bare hands - and will not be taken alive,' the Siberian Times had reported.

A prosecutor warned on local news site vsp.ru that he could 'hold out in the taiga for a month with a knife and a 
single match'.

The criminal says he lived in the dense Taiga forest near to the prison for four months, foraging for food in the wilderness.

Avdeyev - nicknamed the Rambo of Taiga by Russian media - says he had 
not seen another person during his entire time on the run.

However, some reports have suggested that foresters may have told police of his whereabouts after he 
worked for them as a lumberjack.

He did not offer any resistance when captured, the Irkutsk Region branch of the Federal Prison Service said on its website.

On hearing he had been found, one of Avdeyev's relatives is reported to have said: 'It is strange that he surrendered alive.'

Avdeyev's three accomplices were caught by the authorities earlier.

A police probe was launched following the escape but the results are yet to be published.

The criminal will now serve an additional five years on top of his sentence for double murder.

Back in jail: After four months living in the Taiga forest foraging food from the wilderness, the criminal was found by police and returned to the facility in Markovo, Siberia

Avdeyev, whose party trick was breaking bricks or Champagne bottles on his forehead, was jailed for butchering two migrants seven years ago.

The brutal killer decapitated his victims with spades before turning on four others. 

He locked the workers - all of central Asian heritage - in a shed, and then set it on fire.

The four 
survived but were badly disfigured. 

Locals alleged that Tajik migrants in the area were killing local youth by drugging them and staging their suicides, adding that Avdeyev and his accomplices were rightful vigilantes.However, most victims of the attack were Uzbeks who had only arrived a few weeks before.
