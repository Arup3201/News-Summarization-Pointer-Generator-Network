The London stock market staged a strong recovery today following yesterday's disappointment over the European Central Bank's failure to fire the ‘big bazooka’ required to save the single currency.

The FTSE 100 index was 52.37 points or 1 per cent up at 5,714.67 as the market got over the  lacklustre statement from ECB president Mario Draghi.

France's CAC 40 is 2.98 per cent up at 3,328.82, with Germany's DAX also up 3.46 per cent at 6,834.59.

It also came as U.S. firms were revealed to have hired an extra 163,000 workers in July, beating economists' forecasts.

But the U.S. unemployment rate rose 
from 8.2 per cent to 8.3 per cent last month, as more people re-entered 
the workforce but failed to find a job.

Those factors were expected to prompt
the Federal Reserve to launch further stimulus measures, and are 
believed to be behind the French and German blue-chip markets being up 
1.5 per cent.

Last week Draghi vowed to do ‘whatever 
it takes’ to shore up the eurozone. He added: ‘Believe me, it will be 
enough.’

That sparked speculation that the central bank would resume its
government bond-buying programme and bring down soaring borrowing costs
in troubled countries such as Spain and Italy.

But Draghi struck a far more cautious note yesterday and – having left interest rates at 0.75 per cent – said the ECB would come up with ways to help struggling countries ‘over the coming weeks’. 

Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman said: ‘European leaders have once again failed to rise to the occasion.’

Stock markets across Europe slammed 
into reverse following the announcement, and the FTSE 100 index lost 
more than 100 points in a matter of minutes. It closed down 50.52 at 
5662.30.

The crucial 
10-year bond yield in Spain – the interest rate the Government pays to 
borrow – lurched back above the 7 per cent level to 7.4 per cent. 
Italian borrowing costs hit 6.3 per cent.

Marchel Alexandrovich, an economist at 
investment bank Jefferies, said: ‘Draghi’s words are pushing the market 
into outright meltdown.’

Reservations: Jens Weidmann, head of Germany's central bank Bundesbank, opposes the bond-buying programme

Michael Hewson, an analyst at City firm CMC Markets, said: ‘Draghi came to London last week and said, “believe me, it will be enough”, so everyone has been expecting the big bazooka. But he’s turned up today and left the firing pin at home.’

Draghi insisted the euro was ‘irreversible’ and warned traders that ‘shorting the euro is pointless’. But the single currency tumbled against the pound and the dollar.

David Buik, an analyst at Cantor Index, said: ‘That was so disappointing. In fact, it was dreadful – just rhetoric, platitudes and veiled promises – exactly what the market was not prepared to put up with. The reaction was violent.’

Bond yields above 7 per cent are considered unsustainable and proved a tipping point for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, forcing them to beg for international bailouts.

Cyprus has also been rescued by its European neighbours and it is feared that Spain and Italy will be the next dominos to fall, leading to a chaotic break-up of the eurozone.

Spain has already been granted £80billion of aid to prop up its broken banks but that is widely seen as a prelude to a full-blown state bailout.
The ECB was under pressure to wade back into the bond market and snap up Spanish and Italian debt to cap borrowing costs.

But Draghi said there would be no immediate intervention amid opposition to bond-buying from Germany and Jens Weidmann, head of its central bank, the Bundesbank.

‘It’s clear and it’s known that Mr Weidmann and the Bundesbank have their reservations about the programme of buying bonds,’ said Draghi.

Analysts said the failure to deliver on its promises seriously undermined the credibility of Draghi and the ECB.

Craig Erlam, a market analyst at Alpari, said: ‘What he said last week was they’ll do whatever it takes. Today it was more like they’ll do whatever the Bundesbank allows them to.

‘Draghi looked like a man defeated in the press conference, which came shortly after his meeting with Jens Weidmann. Today’s conference really has shown who is king.’

Azad Zangana, European economist at Schroders, said: ‘After building up market expectations to near euphoric levels, Draghi failed to deliver the policy to back up his promises of “doing whatever it takes to save the Euro”.

‘If the ECB does not follow up with some meaningful action in the near future, then there is a risk that markets lose all faith in Draghi’s ability to tackle this crisis.

‘Draghi warned investors not to bet against the euro, but the trouble is those that are doing so have done rather well so far this year.’
