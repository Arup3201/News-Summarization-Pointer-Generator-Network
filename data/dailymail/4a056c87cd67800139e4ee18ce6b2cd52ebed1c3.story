A British couple shot on the holiday island of Barbados tried to fight off their attackers before realising they were armed, it emerged today.

A security guard revealed how retired banker Philip Prior, 72, and wife Ann, 59, struggled with the gunman on Sunday as they walked back to their luxury cruise ship.

Two men have been arrested over the shooting in the island capital Bridgetown.

Witness Nevile Mayers, 62, said: 'I think the man tried to snatch her 
purse but the couple fought back and tried to pull it back – that must 
be when he shot them.'

Arrests: Two men have been arrested in Barbados over the shooting of two British tourists on a Caribbean cruise

Spot: Philip Prior, 72, and his wife Ann, 59, were robbed outside this government building on the outskirts of Bridgetown, capital of Barbados

He told how more 15 people rushed to the aid of the couple after they were shot.

Mr Mayers, whose office is right next to
where the couple were attacked, said: 'I heard two gun shots ring out 
and then there was a lot of noise and commotion.

'So I got up to look outside and saw all these people huddled around the lady lying on the floor. She was making a noise, she was in a lot of pain, she had a big wound on her leg that was bleeding badly.

'People were crowded around her trying to stop the bleeding. I could not see the man at first, there were two many people in the way, so I thought she had been shot twice.

'There was a lot of people trying to 
help. There must have been over 15 people all trying to help her - 
tourists, locals and even taxi drivers.

'It was all quite frantic but every one 
was trying to help and lots of people phoned the police. The emergency 
services must have got there about 10 minutes later.

Mr Prior  was shot in the left side, while his wife Ann was shot in the right thigh as they made their way back to their 
cruise ship

The Adonia: The P&O ship is on a three-month cruise. The cruise left Southampton on January 8

'It was very shocking, you don't get 
that sort of thing happening around here. It is a busy street but it is 
quiet at that time on a Sunday - usually just tourists.

'I have worked here for about 12 years and have not experienced something like that before.'

The couple are recovering in hospital 
in Barbados where they are said to be in a comfortable condition with 
injuries which are not life threatening.

Mr Prior is reported to have been shot
in the pelvis while his wife was hit in the right thigh. The attacker 
stole her handbag and fled on foot after the shooting near the harbour.[

The couple who regularly go on cruise 
holidays have lived for the last four years in a modern detached house 
in Bedfield, near Eye, Suffolk.

An ambulance arrived at the scene shortly after the shooting and rushed the injured tourists to the nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital (pictured)

They previously lived in north Suffolk
after spending several years in Australia where Mr Prior is believed to
have worked for a British bank. It is believed that they did not have 
children together.

Friends of the couple in Bedfield said
they took an active part in village life, helping to serve coffee and 
biscuits to pensioners at a post office which opens one day a week in a 
local pavilion.

Mr Prior also uses his background in 
finance in his post as secretary to the Bedfield Town Trust which raises
money for the needy, the church and the local school by renting out 
land in the villageRetired village shopkeeper David Tye, 81, who is 
chairman of the charity said: 'They are a very nice couple. We are all 
praying that they will make a speedy recovery.

'They loved travelling and this was 
the third cruise they have been on since they moved here. I spoke to 
them before they left and wished them 'Bon Voyage'.

'He told me they would be away for 
five to six weeks. It was a special trip for them as they normally only 
go away for a couple of weeks.

'Phil works hard for the trust and is 
very active in village affairs. He attends parish council meetings and 
is known for his forthright views.

'I am very sad to hear of anyone being shot, but it is awful when it is someone you know.

'Phil is quite reserved, but I could imagine him being quite argumentative if someone roughed him up the wrong way.'

Mr and Mrs Prior flew out of Britain 
at the end of February to Valparaiso, Chile, to start a five week cruise
around South America and the Caribbean on the P & O ship Adonia.

The couple who joined the ship halfway through its South American Odyssey tour were due to sail back to Southampton on April 3.

A neighbour of the couple said: 'They
are often away several times a year. I know they were looking forward 
to this trip because they were going to see the Panama Canal. It is 
awful. Why them?

'I know they didn't like to join the official trips to see various places, so maybe they were on their own.'

Mrs Prior is also thought to have been a retired bank worker.
