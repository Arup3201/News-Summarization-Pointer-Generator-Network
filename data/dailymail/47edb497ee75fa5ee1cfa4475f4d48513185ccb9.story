Phil Schofield of Schofields Holiday Home Insurance said: 'For those looking to invest in property, a holiday home is a great choice, especially abroad. Not only can you make money from rental incomes, but it also offers you an option to have somewhere to stay when you want a holiday. 

'The returns of investment we found were good, especially when you consider how long you keep the property. Obviously when looking for property abroad, you need to be aware of local laws and any costs that might be incurred in the country you’re buying in.'

When looking into the best places you can buy a holiday home abroad, the research found that Catalonia in Spain ranks top for return of investment. Spain consistently sees high tourist numbers year after year, coming in third place in 2013 with 60.7 million visitors to the country.

Investors could see a potential gross rent each year of £26,215 which is based on occupancy over 25 weeks. This equates to an average of £1,048 weekly rental price, taking into consideration high and low season.

In second place was Orlando, in Florida with a ROI of 16.7 per cent and potential rental income (gross) of £9,510 and an average weekly rental price of £380. 

The USA saw the second most visitors in 2013, with 69.8 million and the most popular states in the US for tourism include; Los Angeles, Miami, New York City and Orlando. In Orlando you would only need to spend around  or £56,791 ($91,000) for a two-bedroomed property suitable for a family holiday rental.

Although France saw the most tourists in 2013 with 84.7 million visitors their return on investment was not as favourable, with the best region for rental yields is Provence (Marseille) with ROI being 9.67 per cent. 

The worst place for rental yields was China, although it saw 55.7 million tourists in 2013, possible rental income for its most popular regions is significantly lower than many other places. For maximum return of investment in China you would have to buy in the Xian region which offers 3.79 per cent ROI. 

The data was collected using tourism figures from 2013, average house prices for two bedroom, houses or apartments (depending on the region) and return of investment made before expenses for the holiday home being occupied for 25 weeks of the year. The figures also don’t include any possible tax being charged for the property or profits made.
