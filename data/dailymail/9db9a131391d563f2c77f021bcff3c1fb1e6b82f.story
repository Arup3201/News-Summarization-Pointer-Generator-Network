A mother opened a loaf of bread bought at a Tesco store to make a sandwich for her 10-year-old - only to discover it contained a blood-covered needle used by a heroin-taking grandfather.

The mother had taken two slices from the pack of Roberts wholemeal bread - which she had bought from the Tesco Express in Pendleton, Greater Manchester - when she made the shocking discovery.

The needle had been pushed through the plastic wrapper by David Rodgers, 61, when he visited the shop with his wife, in a desperate attempt to avoid her finding out he was back on the drug.

Rodgers had already used the needle for a heroin fix before he hid it in the bread last December.

The mother, who bought the loaf later that day, was left 'alarmed and distressed' when she noticed the syringe while making the sandwich for her son, Manchester Magistrates' Court heard.

She handed it in to police, who used DNA tracing to track down Rodgers, of Salford, Greater Manchester, who pleaded guilty to contaminating the loaf with intent to cause public alarm.

The case was adjourned for pre-sentence reports and Rodgers was warned he could face jail. There was no suggestion Rodgers had a grudge against Tesco, Dominic Geelan, prosecuting, said.

He added that Rodgers kept the needle in his pocket for two days after injecting himself with heroin. The court heard Rodgers told police: ’It's hard to believe what I did, being a father and granddad.’

What David Rodgers, 61, allegedly told police after placing needle in bread loaf

Mr Geelan said Rodgers was at a loss to explain his actions. He added: ‘The only reason he could think of was that he didn't want his wife to know he was using heroin again.’

Rodgers was said to be aware of the 'hurt and distress' caused to the mother and her family. He accepted he could have thrown the needle on the floor or under shelving in the store.

A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We have been working closely with the police throughout their investigation and on behalf of our customers are pleased that this has been resolved.’
