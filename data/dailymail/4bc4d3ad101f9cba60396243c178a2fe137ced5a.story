Roy Hodgson has given England Under 21 chief Gareth Southgate the pick of his senior squad for next summer’s Euro 2015 tournament in the Czech Republic.

Senior internationals, including Jack Wilshere, Raheem Sterling, Calum Chambers, John Stones, Phil Jones, Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Saido Berahinho, are all eligible for the Under 21 tournament.

England have a fixture against Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7 followed by a trip to Slovenia for a Euro 2016 qualifier seven days later.

Jack Wilshere, was was superb in England's recent 3-1 win over Scotland, is eligible for Southgate's side 

Liverpool and England star Raheem Sterling is another senior star who could play in the 2015 tournament

Manchester United centre back Phil Jones could be available for Southgate in the Czech Republic 

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, fresh from his goal scoring heroics against the Scots, could also feature

Southgate, who is torn between picking the best players from the senior squad and sticking with the players who qualified, now has the final say.

Hodgson, who finished off the international year with a 3-1 victory over Scotland on Tuesday, said: ‘It is very simple. My policy is this: after Gareth Southgate has picked his squad I will pick my squad. I will take whatever is left. Can it be simpler than that? ‘I’ve just said, he can pick any Under 21s who are available and I will take the rest.

‘He will speak to me, tell me what he wants to do. I can’t be fairer then to say it is his choice.

Southgate, however, is torn between including more senior stars and staying loyal to the likes of Danny Ings 

‘Whether he will want to take all these players that is up to him, that’s another matter. You will have to speak to him.’

The Under 21 tournament begins on June 17 and is increasing in importance at the FA following the country’s disastrous showing at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

A number of England Under 21 players have already expressed concern about the possibility of senior stars joining the squad and threatening the team spirit Southgate has engineered.

Southgate could call upon a formidable central defence of John Stones (left) and Calum Chambers 

Hosts Czech Republic, along with Denmark, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Serbia and Sweden have also qualified for the two-week tournament.

Chambers, Shaw, Stones and Berahino, who have all experienced Under-21 football under Southgate, are expected to be named in Southgate’s squad next summer.

Sterling, Jones, Wilshere and Oxlade-Chamberlain are all eligible, but are unlikely to be considered unless they make it known to Southgate that they wish to be involved.

Hodgson added: ‘If Gareth thinks the best way to win the tournament is to jettison a lot of the players he has been working with and take players from our team then that is fine by me, too.

‘He will be under no pressure from me whatsoever. We can deal with four or five absentees.

‘We have two senior games in June and it also would mean that any senior players playing in the tournament in the Czech Republic will be playing three tournaments in a row in the summer without a break.

West Brom striker Saido Berahino has starred for the England Under-21 side this year 

‘The clubs’ co-operation when it comes to selecting players is always important. As far as I understand, the FIFA rules gives us the right to choose whatever players we want.

‘Whether the clubs will be happy with us choosing them, that’s another matter. But luckily it’s not my choice.

‘I will have a choice after Gareth’s selection of the players I want to take to play against Ireland and in Slovenia. I can assure that we will have 11 players on the field on both occasions.'
