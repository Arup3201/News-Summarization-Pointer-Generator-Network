Being stuck in traffic in the pouring rain is bad enough when you're in a car, let alone on a bike. 

So spare a thought for this Polish cyclist who ended up falling headfirst into a puddle after hitting a hidden pothole while trying to skip a queue of cars.

The short clip, filmed from inside a bus, starts as cars queue up along a road while it pours with rain.

A cyclist then appears riding up the inside of the traffic, no doubt hoping to skip the delay to his morning commute.

However his ambitions are stopped in their tracks after he drives his front wheel into a pothole hidden by rainwater.

The hidden hole is deep enough to stop his front wheel in its tracks, sending him flying over the handlebars and face down into the puddle of muddy water.

Despite the painful-looking accident, the man is quickly back on his feet and shrugs at the bus driver as the traffic begins moving again.
