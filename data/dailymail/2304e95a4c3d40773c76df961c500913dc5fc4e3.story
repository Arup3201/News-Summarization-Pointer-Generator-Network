The Duchess of Cambridge appears to be breast-feeding her son – showing her desire to give him the best possible start in life.

Kate was seen leaving Kensington Palace last week in a £50 maternity dress made for breast-feeding mums.

Staff at the private Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital had helped her encourage newborn George to ‘latch on’ properly.

Big hit: The £50 Blossom Knot Front Lavender Dress she wore already has a month's waiting list

It appears she is continuing to follow their advice now she is at her home with her mother in Berkshire.

Experts say breast milk is easier for babies to digest and helps prevent a myriad of diseases – protection that formula milk simply cannot replicate.

On Wednesday the Duchess was seen leaving Kensington Palace wearing a Blossom Knot Front Lavender dress by maternity wear specialists Seraphine.

The dress, which has sold out online and now has a four-week waiting list, is designed for new mums who are breast-feeding.

Seraphine, which is also worn by actresses Halle Berry and Jessica Alba, claims that four of its dresses are worn by the Duchess.

Owner Cecile Renaud said: ‘Kate’s ordered a couple of breast-feeding styles from us.’

The disclosure will be seen as a huge coup for the Breast is Best lobby, which encourages mothers to feed naturally rather than use formula milk.

The Department of Health recommends that mothers breast-feed their children for the first six months.

But the most recent figures showed that fewer than half of new mums were still breast-feeding by the time they took their newborns for six- or eight-week check-ups.

Princess Diana breast-fed both Princes William and Harry. And the Queen breast-fed Prince Charles until a case of measles forced her to stop when he was two months old.

The Duchess appears to be taking naturally to motherhood. It has been suggested that she coped so well with her 11-hour labour that she did not require the strong painkillers regularly offered to mums.

Despite the details of Prince George’s birth being kept secret, sources said Kate declined the option of pain relief.
