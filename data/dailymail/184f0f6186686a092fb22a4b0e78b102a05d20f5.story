A video has emerged reportedly showing children at training camps run by the Islamic State firing machine guns that are almost as big as them.

The footage released by the terror group shows small children sitting reading from the holy book before showing a youngster, wearing a ski mask, firing an automatic weapon, which he struggle to control as he fires it.

It then shows another boy assembling a weapon, while other children look on in the background.

The video, one of many made by the group is thought to be an attempt to boast of their young recruits.

It also shows youngsters taking an oath pledging an allegiance to the Islamic State and an even younger boy being asked what he would like to say to infidels.

He replies: 'Infidels.. you are to be killed.'

One boy, who managed to flee from one of the training camps told CNN how he was just 13 when ISIS tried to recruit him.

He says that his father tried to stop him but militias threatened to behead him if he didn't let his son go.

The footage also shows the children reading and reciting passages from the Quran 

The boy, who has not been named, eventually went to the camp, where he said they exercised, learned about the Quran, took courses on weapons, while some were forced to watch gruesome videos.

He added: 'When we go to the mosque, they order us to come the next day at a specific time and place to [watch] heads cut off, lashings or stonings.

'We saw a young man who did not fast for Ramadan, so they crucified him for three days, and we saw a woman being stoned [to death] because she committed adultery.' 

The boy managed to escape the camp after his father pulled him out and he and his family fled to the safety of Turkey.

The jihadists issue their warning in a video yesterday that the beheadings will continue if the U.S. continues to support the Kurds

Footage of another fifteen members of Kurdish militia captured by the brutal jihadists has been released

The Islamic State also released a decapitation video yesterday threatening America for the second time and urging the Kurds to break from their alliance with the West against the caliphate.

It came just hours after Islamic State released shocking footage of the mass execution of 300 Syrian national army soldiers in the Syrian desert. 

The grainy video, accompanied by the hashtag '2ndAmessagetoAmerica', shows the vicious beheading of a Kurdish soldier, who was part of a group of 15 fighters likely to have been captured by Islamic State during the fighting in Iraq.

The group's first warning ten days ago was entitled 'A Message to America' and showed the decapitation of American journalist James Foley.

The video comes after David Cameron announced yesterday that more armed police will patrol Britain’s streets to counter the threat posed by fanatics returning from Iraq and Syria.

Extremists have declared a self-styled caliphate, a Sunni regime ordering its subjects to operate under an extreme form of Sharia law 

Yesterday David Cameron announced that more armed police will patrol Britain's streets to counter the threat posed by fanatics returning from Iraq and Syria 

He warned that the return of hundreds of murderous extremists posed a greater threat to our security than Al Qaeda or the IRA ever did.

His comments came as Theresa May announced the official terror threat level had been raised to ‘severe’ – the second-highest state – for the first time in three years.

The extremists have declared a self-styled caliphate, a Sunni regime ordering its subjects to operate under an extreme interpretation of Sharia law.

It has opened up three fronts in the fighting in Syria, which is already home to a bloody and long-running civil war between President Assad's forces and anti-government rebels.
