Sir Andrew Motion is launching an app allowing people to download a wide selection of poems

Sir Andrew Motion, the former Poet Laureate, has launched an iTunes-style website for poetry featuring a host of famous names reading their favourite verse.

More than 1,600 different recordings of work by hundreds of writers can be listened to for free or downloaded to keep for a fee from the Poetry Archive.

Recordings include Sir Spike Milligan reading The Land Of The Bumbly Boo and war poet Siegfried Sassoon’s The Dug Out as well as contemporary figures including Carol Ann Duffy who succeeded Sir Andrew as Poet Laureate.

There is also a section including work by authors who died before the invention of recording equipment featuring actors such as Dame Judi Dench, Dame Helen Mirren and Sir Kenneth Branagh reading their favourite poems.

Among the recordings are Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe reading a Shakespeare sonnet and The Hour star Romola Garai reading Matthew Arnold’s Dover Beach.

Sir Andrew said: “We’re hoping this will be The Big Bang for poetry, which is ideally suited to being enjoyed, like music, wherever you are. At the Poetry Archive, we wanted to demonstrate that the sound of a poem is as important to its life and meaning as the words on the page and to bring this to as wide an audience as possible.

Goon Spike Milligan is among the readers in the poetry archive as is the actress Romola Garai

“Now, with the new downloads site, everyone not only has a chance to hear major poets reading their work but they can download and keep them forever too.”

Recordings can be searched by time period, poet or poem, with biographies of the writers and celebrity recommendations.

Downloads cost 89p for individual poems, with albums of verse costing no more than £9.99.
