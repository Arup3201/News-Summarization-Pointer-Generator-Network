They may have never spoken out publicly about their romance, but Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower are magical together, according to their unwitting matchmaker and best-selling writer Cassandra Clare.

The young Hollywood stars met last year on the set of The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, the upcoming big screen adaptation of Cassandra’s book and have been inseparable ever since.

And the novelist – whose new book Clockwork Princess, the highly anticipated end to her Infernal Devices trilogy is out today - tells MailOnline they are 'clearly in love'.

Happy couple: Jamie Campbell Bower and Lily Collins beam as they attend the British Fashion Awards in London in November.

Clearly in love: Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower as Shadowhunters Clary Fray and Jace Wayland in the big screen adaption of City of Bones.

Going into battle: Lily Collins and Jamie Bower Campbell in The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.

The couple play Clary Fray and Jace Wayland, both ‘Shadowhunters’,  a breed of demon hunters, in the film that comes out this summer.

Jamie was previously engaged to his Harry Potter co-star Bonnie Wright after meeting on the set of the Wizard hit, but the couple split last summer after two years together, while Lily dated Twilight hunk Taylor Lautner.

Cassandra, 39, admitted: ‘I remember coming to the set and one of the people who worked on the crew mentioned it.

‘Then I saw them together and they’re so clearly in love and it’s very sweet. I wish them all the happiness.

‘They’re very close and I begin to see them now in my head when I’m writing. I wrote Clary as very petite and delicate with freckles, because it’s a lot of fun to do a reversal because she turns out to be strong, which is very like Lily. There’s a sense of sweetness about her, but she can also transform into being really tough and strong and an ass-kicker, which is a lot of fun too.

Fantastic: Best-selling fantasy author Cassandra Clare

‘And Jamie IS Jace – he’s exactly the same! Very sarcastic and funny and very beautiful.’

As their romance bloomed on the set of her film, Cassandra adds: ‘I still find it amazing that they first time they met was in their audition for Clary and Jace!

‘The first time I really got to talk to them was at dinner, and we were talking about the chemistry test Jamie did with Lily. Lily was our Clary and we were looking for Jace and I said ‘you guys were amazing, anybody could see that Jamie just seemed to be Jace’.

‘And they said ‘we were just watching our audition together the other day’, which I thought was very sweet.  Lily is stunning in person - her mum Jill is very pretty, she came on set while we were filming and you can see she has good genetic material.’

Indeed, speaking about Jamie, 24, earlier this month, Lily, 24 - the daughter of singer Phil Collins - said: ‘He had this perfect mixture of being this witty, kind of jokey, cocky in the best sense of the word, but also extremely vulnerable, emotional and this great mixture of emotions. And that’s what Jace is. He has to walk in a room and make people turn their heads and that’s what Jamie does.

The petite brunette added: ‘He just brought everything to the room that day. And he left and I just turned to everyone and was like, ‘I really don’t know what else you could be looking for. That’s Jace’.’

Cassandra’s success has ensured that she is now one of an elite group of women fantasy writers who have spawned chart-topping series. She joins Harry Potter star J.K. Rowling, Twilight writer Stephanie Meyer and Hunger Games scribe Suzanne Collins in creating strong female characters for young girls to aspire to.

She's magical: Lily Collins in The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.

Jace and the gang: Jamie Campbell Bower and his band of Shadowhunters.

Her new book, Clockwork Princess, is the end of the series which takes place in Victorian England and centres around a teenage girl called Tessa who finds herself swept into the Shadowhunters world.

And Cassandra says: ‘For me, the triad of Harry Potter, the Hunger Games and Twilight feature strong women and as a declared feminist, it’s a wonderful thing. These women have really opened up this particular world of storytelling, which I’m very grateful for.

‘I think as women we’ve always been very used to growing up reading and identifying with male protagonists, especially in fantasy. There’s a saying in publishing that girls will read about boys, but boys will only read about boys and it’s important to give women strong heroines.

‘And as women we’ve come to recognise the necessity of writing these characters and making them accessible to everybody.

Highly anticipated: Clockwork Princess, the third and last installment in The Infernal Devices series, is out today.

‘There’s an aspect to readying this age group, with the trials the characters are facing: how do I become a person? How do I become a  good women? And these books directly address that.’

She added: ‘Harry Potter came out and said these books are about kids, but not necessarily for children. And that made it okay, for people of all ages, from all walks of life, to read fantasy. I feel these books really opened up the gates for people like me.’

Cassandra revealed that she had also been helped by her best-selling peers, although she has never met J.K. Rowling, joking: ‘I believe she lives in a castle in Scotland now!’

However, she does keep in touch with Stephanie Meyer and Suzanne Collins, saying: ‘Stephanie has been lovely, super-promotive and she’s recommended my books to a lot of people.

‘She ready the manuscripts of two of my books early on and was also one of the first big promoters of the Hunger Games, she talked about it everywhere.

‘And Suzanne worked as a screenwriter for a long time and she gives great advice.’

When it comes to bidding farewell to her characters, Cassandra admits: ‘It is really difficult to say goodbye to the characters and know I’m not going to write about them after five years of working and doing research and traveling to England every year.

‘I’ve had a lot of feedback from fans, they email constantly. I’m going to miss Tessa a lot, she has some grand adventures, she has to face off against great enemies, she has to do battle and defeat her enemy and find out who she really is. She knows she has a magical power, but she doesn’t know why.

‘One of the reasons why I constructed a love triangle is that she’s a girl who has these many, many choices about her life.

Co-stars: Lily Collins fell for Jamie Campbell Bower after auditioning with him for The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.

British: The cast is made up from a number of UK actors including Mad Men star Jared Harris who plays Hodge Starkweather in the film.

‘I think the books don’t necessarily follow the traditional love pattern, fans will find the ending bitter sweet, but it’s a fitting conclusion.’

Cassandra, who lives with her husband, fellow writer Joshua Lewis along with their three cats in Western Massachusetts,  is currently working on the sixth installment as she revealed the Mortal Instruments series has its genesis in the 9/11 terror attacks.

She said: ‘I had just moved to New York in September 2001 and immediately 9/11 happened and of course it completely changed the city and everybody who lived there.

‘I was in Brooklyn, coming down the bridge as everyone was walking over, covered in plaster dust and blood, and the shopkeepers opened up along the street to give out free water and we were running over to hand it out. People were very kind and brave in a crisis.

‘It made me want to write a story set in New York, a kind of fantasy and a love letter to the city and the people who live there.

Heartthrob: Jamie Campbell Bower has become a rising star.

‘There was this idea of monsters and demons and people were so afraid of the city being attacked. There were missing posters everywhere - it was a really a terrifying time to live in the city. I thought ‘what if the city was really under attack by supernatural dark forces, who would protect it?’

She sold the film rights to her Mortal Instruments series soon after publication and will be treated to the first glimpse at the first film at a private screening in LA next month.

She admits: ‘I was very lucky and was brought into the audition process and I had all my friends trying to hack into my computer to watch all these famous actors auditioning.’

But the writer will have to wait to see how the film fares to see whether the next two books in the series, City of Ashes and City of Glass, will be turned into movies.

The next installment, City of Heavenly Fire, is due next year. On top of that, she’s written a project with her best friend Holly Black, about a young magician, called The Magisterium.

She’s also teamed up with her husband to write the Shadow Hunters Codex, a guide to her world, which, as she says, makes for interesting dinner talk.

All of which makes for a pretty fantastic life.
