Mido became the youngest manager to win a trophy in Egyptian football as his Zamalek side won the Egyptian cup.

The former Tottenham striker, 31, spent much of his career in England, where he had spells at five different clubs.

But, since returning home the Egyptian has entered management, and despite a difficult first season he has emerged with some silverware.

Celebration: Mido tweeted a photo of himself with the trophy standing next to the Zamalek flag

Back then: Mido scored 19 goals in his two and half year spell in North London in the mid-2000s

Despite the trophy, won after a late goal gave Zamalek a 1-0 win over Smouha, Mido could soon be out of a job. 

The club only finished third in the league, and are currently bottom of their African Champions League group, leading to growing pressure for Mido to be sacked. 

Pointing the way: The Egyptian striker moved to Middlesbrough in 2007 and stayed there for three years

Loan star: Mido had loan spells at Wigan, West Ham and Barnsley before going into management
