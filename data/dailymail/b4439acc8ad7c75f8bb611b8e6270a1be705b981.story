A woman who has suffered from constant hiccups for more than a decade says she is in despair over her condition.

Amanda Corby, 46, of Hull, has bouts of hiccups five times a day every day, leaving doctors baffled.

She hiccups every two seconds in episodes that can last up to ten minutes at a time.

Despair: Amanda Corby has suffered from constant hiccups for more than a decade. Doctors cannot work out how to treat her condition

Hiccups are a result of the layer of muscle below the ribcage, known as the diaphragm, suddenly and involuntarily contracting.

Long-lasting hiccups can be caused by 
underlying problems such as gastrointestinal or respiratory conditions, 
or psychological stresses such as anxiety, fear, grief or shock.

In some
 cases, they can be treated with anesthetics or anti-inflammatory 
medication.

Complications can include insomnia, weight loss, exhaustion and depression.

This means that since the problem began in 2003, she has hiccuped approximately three million times. 

Hiccups are a result of the layer of muscle below the ribcage, known as the diaphragm, suddenly and involuntarily contracting.

She said: 'I’ve tried scaring myself and sipping water - all the old tricks, but nothing works for me.

'I tried hypnosis once which stopped the hiccups for three months, but then they started up again. I’m out of ideas as to what to try next.'

Miss Corby, who works in a bingo hall, says her ailment has caused mirth among colleagues and customers.

She said: 'They began one day while I was at work. When I had more episodes the next day, I wondered whether it was something I was eating.

Ongoing: Since her problem began in 2003, Miss Corby has hiccuped approximately three million times

'They continued for the rest of the week. Weeks turned into months and years. They haven’t stopped yet.

An inventor claims to have developed a device that stops the hiccups every time.

It
 is little more than a plastic stick with a hole in the middle. The user
 bites down on the stick and drinks a glass of water through the hole.

It
 appears the hiccups are stopped by the combination of drinking the 
water and biting the stick, which makes the throat muscles tense.

The 
idea was developed after inventor Chuck Ray had a bout of hiccups and 
decided to experiment by drinking a glass of water with a pen in his 
mouth – and it eased his symptoms.

He said: ‘They didn’t stop immediately but it was enough to make me believe I was on to something.’

More than 10,000 Hiccup Sticks have now been sold at a cost of £13 for a pack of three online.

However not all doctors are convinced by Californian Mr Ray’s idea, pointing out that hiccups normally subside anyway.

'Other
 staff members have made a bit of a joke about it, and I tend to laugh 
along. But there are moments where it’s quite embarrassing, particularly
 when I’m in front of customers.

'At those times I really wish the problem go away forever.'

Six months after the bouts began, Miss Corby saw her GP in the hope of discovering the cause of her hiccups and whether they could be cured.

She said: 'They tend to occur when I’m at work and I can feel when they going to start. At first I thought it was something I ate or drank, but then I realised I don’t eat or drink during a shift, so it can’t be that.

'The doctor didn’t know what to tell me. He just suggested I take sips of water but he wasn’t able to explain why the hiccups had started or what could make them go away.'

Long-lasting hiccups can be caused by underlying problems such as gastrointestinal or respiratory conditions, or psychological stresses such as anxiety, fear, grief or shock. In some cases they can be treated with anesthetics or anti-inflammatory medication.

Complications can include insomnia, weight loss, exhaustion and depression.

Miss Corby said: 'I don’t see the point in going back for medical help. I don’t think anyone will be able to help me. 

'A hypnotherapist trained me to imagine 
putting the hiccups away into a box, and putting that box away forever. 
By filing away the hiccups like that, I seemed to be able to control 
them.

Cure: Miss Corby has even tried hypnotherapy, but this only helped for a few months

'Perhaps longer sessions of hypnotherapy would work, but if they’re just going to start up again in a few weeks, I don’t really think it’s worth it.

'It would be helpful to talk to someone who knows what it’s like, but I don’t know anyone else who has this problem.

'I expect I’ll just have to live with it.'

The world record for hiccups is still held by Charles Osborne, an American who died in 1991.

He endured 68 years of regular hiccuping between 1922 and 1990. In his case, the hiccups began after a pig fell on him.
