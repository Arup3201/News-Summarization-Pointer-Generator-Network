Rapper Nicki Minaj has been accused of blatantly using Nazi imagery and ‘glorifying Hitler’ in the newly released video for her song Only

Rapper Nicki Minaj has been accused of blatantly using Nazi imagery and ‘glorifying Hitler’ in the newly released video for her song Only, which also features Chris Brown, Drake and Lil Wayne.

The animated video, which features Minaj as a dictator, is clearly inspired by the black and white Nazi-propaganda films of German director Leni Riefenstahl.

An army of soldiers wear red armbands reminiscent of those worn by the Nazis, while large red banner flags appear with an overlapping Y-M symbol in a design eerily similar to a swastika.

YM stands for Young Money, the record label founded by rapper Lil Wayne, who appears in the video as industrialist Henry Ford, along with Drake who appears as the pope, while Chris Brown appears as a military leader.

'Hey @NickiMinaj thanks for the blatant Nazi imagery in your new video! really great allusion to persecution & genocide' tweeted Melissa Morgan.

On Reddit, was video was discussion is length under the heading 'The new Nicki Minaj video Only is glorifying Nazism and Hitler'. 

Other criticism on Twitter was directed at Drake, who is half Jewish.

‘Drake I don’t get how you’re Jewish participating in a video that is clearly mimicking Nazi propaganda like are you dumb or do u not care?,’ someone tweeted.

Minaj isn't the first musician to have flaunted with Nazi imagery, but while others such as Pink Floyd can claim to have been making a political statement, the rapper appears to be using comparisons to Hitler's regime as a compliment.

Minaj, who hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards in Glasgow, Scotland on Sunday evening, has yet to respond to the criticism.
