This is the story of one couple who have literally given everything for their daughter to survive into adulthood. 

Faye Hawkins, 26, from Wodonga on the NSW-Victorian border, was born with Branchiootorenal syndrome, a condition that affects the ears and kidneys.

By the time she was just three years old she was deaf and her kidneys had started to fail and she needed a transplant, reports Channel 9.

The kidney Barry donated to Faye now needs to be replaced and her mum Rose is stepping in to help 

Faye's mum Rose will this week donate one of her kidneys to her daughter. 

Twenty-three years ago Faye's dad Barry donated a kidney to Faye, but that kidney is now failing and needs replacing.

Mr Hawkins told Channel 9: 'It's the best thing I could have done I suppose, you do anything for your kids.

'We will be there all the way for her.' 

Faye Hawkins will have to spend a month in hospital under observation after the kidney transplant 

Faye was born with Branchiootorenal syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the ears and kidneys

Faye's dad Barry Hawkins said: 'You do anything for your kids', she had her first kidney transplant when she was three-years-old 

'You don’t like to see your kids suffer so you’d rather take their pain than for them to go through it'. 

Without a kidney transplant Faye would have ended up needing dialysis. 

Mrs Hawkins told Border Mail: 'Faye’s still quite healthy now, so it’s good to do it now while she’s like that rather than letting it go further and have it harder to recover.'

The kidney Faye's dad donated to her only has a ten per cent function and she will need to stay in hospital for about a month after the operation. 

The family are currently in Melbourne for a range of 'pre-operative procedures' to get Faye and her mum ready for the transplant on Tuesday. 

The family want to make others aware of the good of organ donation.  

'A lot of people don’t because they don’t reckon it will happen to them. They just need to tick the box,' they told Border Mail.
