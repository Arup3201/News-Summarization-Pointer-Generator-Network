A university student who works at Tesco claimed that he has been threatened with the sack over his bright red mohawk - even though his manager's hair is dyed the same colour.

Max Cole, 20, turned up with the bold red hairstyle to his shift at Tesco in his hometown of Crediton, Devon, where he works to fund his studies at York University.

He was sent home with no pay because of his new look, despite the fact that his manager's hair is dyed the same colour. Mr Cole said that other employees working at the Tesco Extra branch have their hair dyed 'unnatural colours'.

'Inappropriate': Second-year York University student Max Cole was sent home without pay when he arrived for his shift at Tesco Extra in his hometown of Crediton, Devon, with his mohawk that is streaked with red dye

The second-year undergraduate student said he changed his hairstyle frequently in order to express his 'individuality.

He described his previous 'normal' haircut - a short crew cut just slightly overgrown - as 'looking a bit shabby'.

After being told his new hairstyle was not 'business-like or smart', Max was ordered out of the store empty handed and told he’d otherwise face the sack, despite female staff having 'an array of unnatural colours in their hair'.

Acceptable: Mr Cole has dyed his hair back to black, and has to style it flat, in order to continue working at the store over summer

'All my managers have dyed red hair too - which adds to how unfair it is.'

A Tesco source suggested that it was the style of Mr Cole's hair, rather than the colour, that was the reason behind his being asked to leave.

The student says the job is crucial to helping him fund his degree in Genetics, but his managers were quick to tell him to leave when he arrived at the store with his bold style.

Mr Cole said he styled his hair to look like Iranian NASA scientist Bobak 
Ferdowski, who has attracted attention for his own red-streaked mohawk.

He said that he was immediately asked to leave the store when he arrived with the new cut.

He said: 'Before I could even clock in, I was taken off the shop floor by my line manager and was told I was not allowed to be on the shop floor with my current hair style due to it being inappropriate and was told that I had to go home and would not be paid for the day.

'Feeling this decision was completely unjust I went to the manager’s office and requested to see the personnel manager, who I thought would be the one, if anyone, to be on my side.

'However she took the general opinion of my hair being unacceptable for work, despite me pointing out that several managers have red hair, and other employees have an array of unnatural colours in their hair in several different styles.'

'Unfair': Mr Cole, who is a genetics student, said that he was unfairly targetted as other employees - including his line manager - all work in the store with dyed hair

Max says he worked in the same store as a teenager when his hair was bleached white, to which staff never raised an eyebrow.

He added: 'I was told that I am allowed to keep my black mohawk, but will be fired if I dye it red, which I once again I stated I felt was unfair due to the numerous number of female employees with red hair.'

A Tesco spokesperson said: ‘We ask our colleagues to serve our customers in a smart and professional manner. Max has discussed this with his Personnel Manager and it’s great that he is continuing to work with us through his summer break’.
