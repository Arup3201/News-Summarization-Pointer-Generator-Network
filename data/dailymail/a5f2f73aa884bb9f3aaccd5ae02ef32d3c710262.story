She's the Victoria's Secret model who hit headlines when she was seen on 
Justin Bieber's luxury yacht in Ibiza days after the bad boy popstar 
scuffled with Orlando Bloom.

And it looks like Shanina Shaik is set to fill even more headlines this year after landing a new fashion campaign.

The 23-year-old has been snapped up by Accessorize to model its AW14 collection alongside Anna Brewster and Milou Sluis.

Look who it is! Shanina Shaik, a good friend of Justin Bieber, has been snapped up by Accessorize to model its AW14 collection

The girls follow in the footsteps of former Accessorize models such as Nina Agdal, Kate Upton, Claudia Schiffer, and Heidi Klum.

The shoot took place in the idyllic English countryside, at the luxurious 17th century Palladian country house, Aynhoe Park.

Natural beauty: The Australian model can be seen in a woodland ground wrapped up in a printed scarf and khaki jacket

Glamorous girls: The finale of the campaign features sparkle, glitter and giant gold balloons in the shape of the number 30 to celebrate the brand's big birthday

The first half of the campaign see the girls gathered outside the front of Aynhoe Park wearing statement collars, sassy pumps and clutching structured day bags.

As the weather progresses into deeper autumn, the models are seen relaxing in the wooded grounds wrapped up in faux furs (very on-trend for the coming season), oversized Burberry-esque blanket scarves and felt fedoras.

The finale of the campaign is the Christmas shots, with a party scene re-created inside thehouse featuring sparkle, glitter and giant gold balloons in the shape of the number 30 to celebrate the brand's big birthday.

How we're used to seeing her: The model has been holidaying in Ibiza with Justin Bieber and kept her fans updated with a series of sultry bikini snaps

Today it was back to reality for Shanina, who returned to Australia after her wild partying with Justin Bieber.

Seen mainly sporting swimwear in Spain, the 23-year-old wrapped up warm as she touched down at Sydney airport in the depths of Australian winter.

Shanina was seen on Justin Bieber's 
luxury yacht in Ibiza days after the bad boy popstar made headlines 
around the world for his scuffle with Orlando Bloom.

On Thursday he shared a selfie of the two on Instagram, captioning the pic with 'don't even start with the dating rumours.'

As if this all weren't complicated enough, on Saturday, Tyson Beckford - who dated Miranda Kerr before her marriage to Orlando, and went out with Shanina until November of last year - 
jetted into Ibiza.

Shanina
 also made an appearance on Tyson's Instagram page, with the former item 
seen partying with a group of friends just prior to her leaving 
the country.

We don't think this is the last we'll be seeing of her. The model, who opened for Jason Wu at fashion week, and also walked for Diesel, Oscar de la Renta, L'Wren Scott, Tom Ford, Vivienne Westwood, and Stella McCartney, has done a shoot with Vogue Australia due to be released at some stage during the year.

He's got a way with Angels! Days after he made 
headlines with his scuffle with Orlando Bloom, Justin Bieber shared a 
selfie with Shanina to his 18million-plus Instagram followers

Catching up? She then partied up with her 
ex-boyfriend Tyson Beckford just prior to her leaving Ibiza, with the 
model posting this to his Instagram account on Tuesday morning. The two 
dated until November of last year
