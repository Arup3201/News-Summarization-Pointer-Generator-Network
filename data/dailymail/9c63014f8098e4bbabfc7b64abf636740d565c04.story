Actress Gwyneth Paltrow's hairstylist and business partner David Babaii has revealed that the self-proclaimed lifestyle guru helped him to shed more than 135 pounds in four months. 

Speaking to E! News, Los Angeles-based Mr Babaii confessed that he turned to close friend Gwyneth, who founded popular lifestyle website Goop in September 2008, for help and advice after his weight ballooned to 285 pounds following a bad break-up.

'I was working a lot, I had a really bad breakup,' the 40-year-old, who was once nicknamed the 'king of curls by Vogue, said. 

'It was like my first adult breakup. I looked at myself in the mirror and I wanted to start changing.'

After initially just seeking some weight loss and health advice from 42-year-old Gwyneth, who is renowned for her incredibly strict, gluten-free diet and intense workout regime, Mr Babaii explained that the Oscar-winner grew to become more like his life coach, offering him help and support whenever it was needed. 

'If I was hungry, I would email her any time of the day and if she wasn't sleeping, she'd reply right away,' he added.

Alongside Equinox fitness trainer Will Costello, Gwyneth helped Mr Babaii to slim down to a size that he felt completely comfortable and confident with - in a way that worked for him day-to-day.

'She had become almost like a life coach,' he said, adding: 'She did not look down at me or judge me.'

Mr Babaii now hopes that his dramatic transformation will inspire others to embrace a healthier, happier lifestyle.

In a post on his official Facebook page, published on Tuesday, the celebrity hairstylist, who has previously worked with the likes of Kate Hudson, Uma Thurman and Christina Aguilera, shared before and after images of himself, along with a written tribute to Gwyneth.

'I would never want anyone to see my before but I have a friend that has been fighting so hard to lose weight and I hope this can show him that if I can do it then really anyone can,' he wrote.

'I did not love myself and food was my best friend till one day I looked at myself I mean really looked at myself and thought I need help and I want to love myself again so my dear friend [Gwyneth Paltrow] helped me get myself to understand that I’m worth it and I am loved and that I should love myself.

'She did not look down at me or judge me but with love helped me lose [to] 135lbs!'
