A couple who met in a weight loss clinic waiting room went on to lose 37 stone between them - and fell madly in love.

Jo Johnston and her boyfriend Shaun Palmer forged a close bond while supporting each other on their weight-loss journeys - and now they plan to marry.

Jo, 32, went from 32 stone to 13 and Shaun from 38 stone to 21 following gastric surgery - losing the equivalent weight of a grizzly bear.

incredible 37 stone between them - after meeting in a weightloss waiting
room

How they were: After helping encourage each other in hospital, the pair swapped numbers, and two weeks later they met for their first date

Jo, from Aberystwyth, Wales, said: 
'We got chatting about our diets and hit it off immediately, it was like
we'd known each other for years.

'We both understood what the other was going through.'

The pair were both patients at Luton and Dunstable Hospital in January 2011.

And, seven months later, Jo was preparing for her operation when she noticed Shaun, 45, in the hospital bay next to hers.

She said: 'I was nervous about the op, but Shaun had had his the day before, and he told me it would be OK.'

After the operation, the pair lay side by side, separated only by a cardboard wall in the hospital bay, calling out messages of support to each other.

When Shaun was discharged a day later, the pair swapped numbers, and two weeks later they met for their first date - a walk in the park and ice-cream - since neither could eat solid food.

The romance flourished and just ten months later in November, Shaun proposed.

Support: After their gastric band operations, the pair lay side by side, separated only by a cardboard wall in the hospital bay, calling out messages of support to each other and then fell in love

Jo, whose previous marriage broke down as she went through her treatment, said: 'Shaun is completely the other half of me, it was just meant to be.

'When I started my treatment I was married, but the relationship deteriorated as I went through it. My husband didn't understand but Shaun was always there offering support.

'Every time I went into hospital he was there. We had surgery a day apart and he was in the bay next to mine. It was fate.'

Now the couple do everything together, from exercising, to introducing new foods into their diets, to buying new wardrobes.

Her former self: When Jo was a size 34, she rarely left the house and even joined Weight Watchers aged 9- photo (R) shows her surgery scars

Jo, who first started going to Weight Watchers when she was just nine- years-old, said: 'I'm a size 16 now, I can't remember the last time I was that size.

'For the first time in ages I can go out to the High Street and buy clothes - it's brilliant.'

When Jo was a size 34, she rarely left the house because the tops of her thighs rubbed together so much, they'd leave holes in her leggings after just two days.

She said: 'I used to say "the wheelie bin goes out more often than I do."'

Meanwhile Shaun, who had a heart attack at the age of just 25, used to wear 9XL clothes and drink up to 32 bottles of Smirnoff Ice each weekend.

Jo, who is partially sighted and unemployed, said: 'He loves being able to buy clothes on the High Street too, because he used to have to order everything from America.

Different people: Now the couple's diet had changed drastically, so have their appearances as they plan to wed

'His waist has gone from 78 inches to 56 inches, and he's been able to buy his first pair of jeans. I'm starting to call him scrawny Shauny.'

The couple even jokingly compete against one another in the weighing stakes - Jo has lost 20 stone and Shaun has lost 17.

Jo said: 'We try to outdo each other and eat healthier foods for a bit of fun.'

But Jo's diet wasn't always healthy. She fell in to comfort eating following three miscarriages in her previous relationship.

So in love: Jo says that her boyfriend 'understands her' after her previous relationship broke down because of her weight battle

Before seeking help for her weight problem she would skip breakfast and tucked into a Ginster's Pasty for lunch, followed by a chile con carne meal for four for dinner.

After she would eat half a tub of ice-cream, a large chocolate bar, a cream egg, four packets of crisps, and four slices of bread with four eggs before bed, all washed down with an incredible six litres of coke.

Now the couple's diet had changed drastically, so have their appearances.

Jo said: 'Shaun gets more attractive every day, but of course he's still the same man inside. I'll love him though thick and thin.'

Better together: Now the couple do everything together, from exercising, to introducing new foods into their diets, to buying new wardrobes
