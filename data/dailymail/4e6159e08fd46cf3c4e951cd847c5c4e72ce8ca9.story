Poverty levels in the UK have fallen to levels last seen more than two decades ago, new figures showed today.

The number of people in relative poverty has fallen by 100,000 over the past year to 9.7 million.

Overall, 15 per cent of people were in relative poverty last year, the lowest level since the 1980s.

The official figures were released by the Department for Work and Pensions. 

They show how relative poverty - measured as living on 60 per cent of median average incomes - has been falling gradually since 2008-09 in the wake of the financial crash.

Before housing costs are taken into account, the number of people living below the threshold has fallen by 100,000 over the past year to 9.7 million. In 2007-08 the figure hit 11million. 

Median incomes remained broadly unchanged between 2011/12 and 2012/13, up £2 to £440 a week for a couple with no children.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: 'Despite the deepest debt-fuelled recession in living memory when £112 billion was wiped off the economy, we have protected the most vulnerable families from falling behind with 300,000 fewer children in poverty since 2010.

'Today's figures underline the need to stick to the Government's long-term economic plan of restoring a strong economy that creates jobs, and a tax and welfare system that helps people into work and makes work pay.'

However, the percentage of people in absolute low income after housing costs has increased slightly to 23 per cent, the highest it has been since 2001-02.

Among children, 17 per cent are in relative low income before housing costs, the lowest level since the 1980s, although it has not fallen in the last year.

Labour's Rachel Reeves, shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'These figures show the Government's child poverty strategy is failing abysmally with no progress for the millions of children still living in poverty. 

'They also include extremely worrying signs that rising housing costs are set to push more children into poverty and that severe poverty is on the rise.' 

The Gingerbread campaign group said the statistics also showed a steep rise in child poverty for single parent households where the parent works full-time, climbing from 17 per cent of households where the single parent works full-time in poverty in 2011-12 to 22 per cent in 2012-13.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the figures showed that the government had protected the most vulnerable families from falling behind

Almost one in four children whose single mother or father works full-time is now growing up poor, while nearly one in three with a single parent working part-time is in poverty, said the group.

Gingerbread chief executive Fiona Weir said: 'It is deeply concerning that while the economy is on the up, hundreds of thousands of families remain trapped into poverty. 

'For far too many single parent families, work offers no real promise of escape from hardship, as today's figures show a rise in working poverty where a single mum or dad is working full-time.' 

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Today's figures clearly show why living standards are falling. While wages have stagnated, and benefits and tax credits have been cut, prices have been rising - especially the cost of housing.

'Since the last election a million more adults and half a million more children fell into absolute poverty when housing costs are taken into account. 

'Without a major affordable home building programme and action to secure fair wages, this type of poverty will continue to grow.' 

Julia Unwin, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: 'Today's figures show that we are not making sufficient progress into tackling high levels of poverty, despite rising employment and economic recovery.  

'The return to lasting economic growth and long-term prosperity will be hampered if we fail to address the levels of poverty in the UK. We know that individual policies which tinker around the edges do not reduce poverty.

'We need a comprehensive strategy that gets to grips with low pay, the high cost of essentials and reform to the tax and benefits system to ensure work is a route out of poverty.' 

Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said: 'Child poverty remains at its lowest level since the 1980s. It has fallen by 300,000 since 2009/10.

'Does the Government want to continue to do more in this area? Of course.

'Absolutely at the heart of improving prosperity across the country and for all is the importance of sticking to the long-term economic plan, because at the heart of dealing with poverty is work.'

The spokesman added: 'In terms of wider poverty, the target established under the previous government is one of relative income, and that stands at its lowest level since 1982.'
