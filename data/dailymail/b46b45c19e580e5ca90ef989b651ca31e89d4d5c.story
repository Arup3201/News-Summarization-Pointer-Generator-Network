Estibaliz Carranza, 34, was sentenced to life in prison in 2012 for the murders of former-spouse Holger Holz in 2008 and ice-cream machine salesman Manfred Hinterberger two years later 

A cold-blooded ice-cream parlour owner dubbed the 'ice lady' for the calculated way in which she killed her ex-husband and lover has revealed how she dismembered them with a chainsaw and took concrete-mixing classes to hide the bodies.

Estibaliz Carranza, 36, was sentenced to life in prison in 2012 for the murders of former-spouse Holger Holz in 2008 and ice-cream machine salesman Manfred Hinterberger two years later.

She shot both men in the back of the head at close range, cut up their bodies and froze them in a deep-freeze refrigerator before later interring them in concrete under the cellar of her store.

Now, in an explosive memoir written from her jail cell, she has revealed the grisly details about how she carried out each murder. 

Holz became her first victim after he refused to move out of their home, in Vienna, Austria, following their divorce.

She told how she walked up behind him one evening as he worked on his computer, held her Beretta .22-calibre handgun to the back of his head and pulled the trigger. 

She then used the noise of her ice-cream making machines to drown out the sound of the chainsaw as she cut him into pieces before hiding some of his body parts in flower pots in her basement. 

Two years later, after apparently getting away with murder, Carranza also murdered her new boyfriend, Mr Hinterberger, while he was sleeping after a drunken argument. 

Before his killing, however, she took both shooting course and a concrete mixing course in preparation. 

Claiming he was drunk and abusive, she said: 'He turned his face to the wall and started snoring... I was so angry. I had the gun under the mattress. I took it out, loaded and shot.'

In the morning she 'asked him to forgive me for what I had done'. She then proceeded to dispose of the body.

A year later, she fell pregnant by a third boyfriend, and was looking forward to a happy future when workmen stumbled across the remains in the basement, and called the police.

But she fled 

Writing in her book, entitled 'My Two Lives, The True Story of the Ice Lady' and co-written with journalist Martina Prewein, she said: 

Victims: She killed Mr Holz (left) after he refused to move out of their home following their divorce, then shot dead Mr Hinterberger (right) while he was sleeping after a drunken argument

Scene: She used the chainsaw to cut up the bodies then buried them in cement in the basement of Schleckeria -- which is still serving ice-cream today in Wien-Meidling, Vienna

'I killed two men, whom I once loved. There is no way of glossing this over, I robbed two mothers of their sons. I believed I had to serve men, no matter how they behaved.'

She said she had simply been unable to break up with her lover, Manfred Hinterberger.

'I couldn't say no. I couldn't do it, I couldn't get free of him,' she wrote.

She said she made them into 'monsters and finally they made me a beast'.

A psychiatric report commissioned by the court said that Carranza, now in a unit for the 'mentally abnormal', was dangerous and was like a 'princess... who just wants to be 'rescued' by a man'. 

During her trial, Judge 
Susanne Lehr told a Vienna court her confession and her state of 
'considerable psychological damage' were mitigating factors, but her 
careful planning and her behaviour after the murders counted against 
her.

Carranza,
 wearing the same grey dress she had worn throughout the four-day trial 
and donning a pair of glasses, did not react to the unanimous jury 
verdict and nodded to confirm she had understood the sentence.

A psychiatric report commissioned by the court said that Carranza, now in a unit for the 'mentally abnormal', was dangerous and was like a 'princess... who just wants to be "rescued" by a man' 

Her
lawyer Rudolf Mayer - who also defended Josef Fritzl, who used his daughter as a sex 
slave - said he would appeal to have the verdict overturned.

The
 photogenic Mexican-Spanish immigrant, whose case attracted 
extensive interest from Austrian media,
 said Mr Holz had completely changed after their wedding, turning verbally 
abusive, lazy and joining a Hare Krishna sect.

She complained that he 
had refused to move out when she had a new lover, even after their 
divorce.

The new lover, Mr  Hinterberger, suffered the same fate 
two years later, receiving four shots in the back of the head as he lay 
in bed snoring after she had tried to start a discussion about his 
infidelity. 

Carranza wept as she told the judge: 'All I can say is that I'm sorry I took the lives of Holger and Manfred.'

Earlier,
 prosecutor Petra Freh told the court Carranza was a manipulative liar 
prepared to do anything for her own advantage, according to the Austria 
Press Agency.

Psychiatrist 
Heidi Kastner, who spent more than 30 hours with Carranza before the 
trial, said the murderer had a 'grave, comprehensive, multi-faceted 
personality disorder' and was at considerable risk of killing again if 
she did not have therapy.

Kastner
 was also the expert psychiatric prosecution witness in the 2009 Fritzl 
case, spending four months with him before the trial that ended in his 
conviction for rape, incest, kidnapping and enslavement of his daughter 
over 24 years.

The remains 
of Carranza's victims were found by chance last year when maintenance 
work was being done in the building where she had buried them.
