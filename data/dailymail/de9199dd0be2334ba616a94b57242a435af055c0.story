People often say that dogs are man's best friend.

But these cats could give them a run for their money. 

From life-savers to survivors, the incredible stories that emerged from this year's National Cat Awards are certainly something of a win for social media's favourite pet.

Incredible stories: Hero Cat of the year Cleo (left)  rushed for help when her owner had a heart attack. Nelson (right) survived after being thrown in the sea tied in a sack

Ready for action: Slinky Malinki was a runner up for Hero Cat for tapping on a neighbour's window when his owner passed out after taking prescribed morphine

Hundreds entered the revered contest's five categories: Hero Cat, Most Caring Cat, Most Incredible Story, Outstanding Rescue Cat and the public vote category.

Today, the final five of the competition, in support of Cat's Protection to encourage people to adopt cats, were revealed in a ceremony at London's Savoy Hotel.

The Hero Cat award went to 15-year-old Cleo, who rushed for help when her owner Richard Jenkins was having a heart attack.

Trying and failing to call his wife downstairs, Mr Jenkins was left struggling for breath in his room.

But Cleo pounced into action, running up and down the stairs until Pauline, confused, followed her up to calm her down.

She reached her husband just in time and called 999. He is now recovering well. 

The incredible story is one of the five heart-warming tales that have won over the judges at this year's National Cat Awards.

Cleo, who still lives with Mr and Mrs Jenkins in Chessington, Surrey, took the title ahead of Smudge, who pounced on a gang of boys attacking his five-year-old owner.

Slinky Malinki, a black cat from Todmorden, West Yorkshire, was also commended as a runner-up for tapping on a neighbour's window when his owner, Janet, passed out after being prescribed morphine for her chronic back pain.

The pub mascot: Legz, who has three legs, was awarded the top prize for rescue cats as he has inspired pub-goers at the Charlotte Despard pub in Archway, north London, to adopt a cat themselves. People come from all over to donate presents - from catnip to toys - to the three-year-old ginger tabby

Guy (left) was a runner up in the public vote category. He was found abandoned in a cardboard box in Birmingham by owner Hazel Norris shortly after her husband died. He has helped her cope and helped her autistic son learn social skills. Jessie (right) was also nominated for helping her teenaged owner through a tough school

Lifeline: Mr Chips, who is permanently disabled after badly breaking his leg, has helped his owner Ian Turner of Llandudno in Conwy, Wales, cope with the strain of a dozen operations which affected both his mental and physical health, leaving him at times suicidal. Last night, he won the public vote award for best cat

But it was 20-year-old Nelson who took the Most Incredible Story award.

Having used up a fair few of his nine lives, Nelson was thrown into the sea in a sack as a kitten.

He was one of only two of his littermates to survive when a fisherman pulled them from the waves. 

For the following few years, he lived rough on the docks near Seaham, County Durham.

One night, he was targeted by a gang of rock-wielding youths, leaving him with just one eye.

And he now suffers from an inoperable heart condition, diagnosed in January 2014.

But, now in the care of a family in Durham, he has fought back and shocked vets with his energy levels. 

Downton Abbey's Paul Copley, who played Mr Mason, selected Nelson for the award. He said: 'Three amazing stories about three remarkable pusscats, but Nelson is my choice. To survive all that he has and still be able to trust humans is quite something!' 

Companion: Alfie provided constant support to his own Cerian Munn in Southampton, Hampshire, when she underwent a life-saving kidney transplant

Tommy, owned by Mike Smith in London, leaped up and opened the lock on the family's front door when they came home from holiday and found themselves locked out

Doing what they can: Kipper (left), owned by Paul Greenwood of Buxton, Derbyshire, has been credited with bringing down his blood pressure. Meanwhile, Holly (right), owned by Ayshe Kadir of Loughton, Essex, started sleeping in Ayshe's bed when she noticed her owner was feeling ill with chronic headaches

The Most Caring prize went to Elias, the three-year-old pet of Army veteran Jack Dignam-Thomas.

Suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder, Jack often falls into spells of disquiet, becoming introverted and disturbed.

Elias, however, refuses to let him withdraw for long.

Unlike most cats - more 'stand-offish' than dogs - Elias is always jumping around and demands attention.

And according to Jack, it has been the key factor in helping him recover from the horror he experienced on the front line.

Abandoned cats were also recognised in the awards.

The award for Outstanding Rescue Cat went to Legz, a three-legged ginger tabby who is now the mascot of the Charlotte Despard pub in Archway, north London.

People travel from all over to visit Legz and bring gifts like catnip and toys. 

Many pub-goers have even told Legz's owners Amber and Chris that they have been inspired to adopt a cat of their own.

Judge Saffron Sprackling, the lead singer of techno-pop band Republica, said: 'Though Legz has lost one leg, it hasn't stopped him from befriending people and bringing together the community in his local pub with his personality and charm. 

'He has also inspired people to rescue other cats as they can see he is a shining example that a rescue cat can bring happiness into people's lives! He is a true ambassador for rescue cats and Cats Protection!'
