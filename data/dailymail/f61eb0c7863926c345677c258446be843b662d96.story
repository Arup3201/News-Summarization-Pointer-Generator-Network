The world's oldest 20 horsepower Rolls-Royce has sold for more than £25,000 after it was discovered rusting in a remote Welsh barn.

Enthusiasts thought the 1922 Goshawk prototype, nicknamed 'Cindarella' by its developers, was scrapped until it was spotted hidden under farm equipment by a former owner.

Experts say it could easily be worth £150,000 once it is fully restored - but getting it up to that standard may cost £100,000.

Rusting: The car sold for more than £25,000 but could cost £100,000 to restore to its original condition

The Rolls-Royce 20 - whose chassis number is 6G2 - is one of just seven experimental vehicles built in 1922 and code-named Goshawk.

The firm which was famous for the overly extravagant Silver Ghost used the prototype to develop a new, smaller Rolls-Royce for the more austere world after the First World War.

The prototype, whose original numberplate was CH2927, was trialled in England and France and racked up 20,000 miles before it was pensioned off in October 1925.

It was sold to a Mr G Palgrave-Brown from Suffolk, who kept it until at least the 1940s.

But the car's trail went cold after that, and another chassis - 4G2 - was officially granted the honour of the oldest surviving Rolls-Royce 20.

A trader bought 6G2 in 1982, by which time its huge significance had faded into distant memory.

Prestigious: A previous seller was asked to examine the car and realised he had owned it 14 years earlier

Detective: The valuer then painstakingly tracked down the compelling history of the chassis

Fixer-upper: After its true value went neglected for so long, there is some serious work to be done on the car

The name Rolls-Royce is synonymous with over-the-top luxury, but for a brief period in the 1920s the firm made a firm push towards the middle-class.

Until 1922, the only Rolls available had been the hulking Silver Ghost, introduced in 1907 with a huge engine of more than 7,000cc.

With a top speed of 62mph, the 20 horsepower car - nicknamed the 'Baby Rolls' - was aimed towards owner-drivers instead of those with chauffeurs.

It became popular with the burgeoning inter-war middle classes of doctors, solicitors and businessmen.

At 4,118cc, prototype 6G2's engine was more powerful than the 3,127cc model which would go into general production.

Its top speed was also lower, at between 47 and 50mph on a road with stable conditions

But despite the experiment, Rolls' reputation would be firmly cemented as the car of Britain's very richest. The famous four-door Phantom I, an example of extreme luxury, was developed just three years later in 1925.

He sold it the next year to a collector in Wales who, not knowing how important it was, left it to rust.

Fourteen
 years passed, and the trader built up a far fuller knowledge of 
Rolls-Royce cars. By sheer chance, when Welsh owner rediscovered the car
 and decided to have it valued, the expert was none other than its 
original seller from the 1980s.

The
 thrilled trader bought it back and established its authenticity, and 
the car was reunited with its title of the oldest 20 horsepower 
Rolls-Royce in the world.

After keeping it in his private museum of classic cars for more than a decade, he decided to have it auctioned.

The car was sold with its original instruction manual and spare parts including an engine block, front road springs, windscreen parts and floorboards.

It sold for £25,520 yesterday when it went under the hammer at Brightwells Auctioneers in Leominster, Herefordshire.

James Dennison, Brightwells classic car sales consultant, said: 'To find the remains of an ancient vehicle slumbering in a barn is exciting enough.

'It’s every car buff’s dream to find an historic motorcar slumbering in a barn.

History: The car was even sold with its original 92-year-old instruction manual

'But when that vehicle turns out to be a long-last artefact of historical importance, the thrill is all the greater.

'Fourteen
 years passed, during which the vendor, now a committed Rolls-Royce 20 
enthusiast, had owned a whole string of these fine cars and got to know 
them inside out.

'When he 
next stumbled across the chassis he had sold all those years before, he 
immediately noticed that there was something intriguing about it.

'The
 more he looked, the more intriguing it got, sparking off years of 
painstaking research culminating in the chassis being officially 
recognised for what it was - the oldest Rolls-Royce 20 in existence.

'It needs a lot of work doing to it. You could easily spend £100,000 on it if you gave it to a professional.'
