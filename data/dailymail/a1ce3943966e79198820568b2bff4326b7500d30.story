Dubbed the modern day Kate Moss and 
Naomi Campbell, Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn are two of the hardest-working models in the industry.

The duo have been pounding London Fashion Week's hottest catwalks and dancing the night away at the coolest parties.

But amidst wild parties, castings and even motherhood - Jourdan has a three-year-old son - the real-life best friends have managed to squeeze in a prestigious beauty campaign.

Work hard, play hard: Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn may have been pounding the catwalks at fashion week but they've still made time to film their latest YSL beauty campaign

Cara and Jourdan have just unveiled their sexy and fun new advert for Yves Saint Laurent Beaute's Touche Eclat Wild Edition.

In the mini movie, the supermodels can be seen touching up each other's make-up with the iconic product.

They then take to the dance floor and bust some moves, all while having a good giggle together and promoting the brand's newest product.

Girly giggles: Cara and Jourdan, who call themselves the 'double D's', share some laughs as they recline on a golden bed in the short film

Speaking about the limited edition product, which comes in a leopard patterned tube, a spokesperson for YSL said the 'unique design pays tribute to the Saint Laurent woman echoing her strength and animal instinct.'

The highlighter pen was created by Yves Saint Laurent in 1992 and has since become the best-selling beauty product of all time.

This isn't the first time the famous friends have worked together. Cara and Jourdan, who call themselves the 'double D's', were the stars of DKNY's SS14 campaign shot in New York.

Posing
 on a graffiti-emblazoned taxi in the middle of Times Square, the duo 
were joined by British model Eliza Cummings, skateboarder Dylan 
Rieder and hot American rapper ASAP Rocky.

They both walked in Christopher Bailey's Burberry show yesterday, as well as the Giles show alongside Kendall Jenner.
