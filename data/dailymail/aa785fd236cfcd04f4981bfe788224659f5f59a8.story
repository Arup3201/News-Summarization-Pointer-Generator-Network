President Obama says Iran is ‘over a year or so’ away from developing nuclear weapons and that he will use ‘all options’ to stop them.

In the lead-up to his first ever presidential visit to the country next week, Obama sat for an interview with Israeli television.

‘Right now, we think it would take over a year or so for Iran to actually develop a nuclear weapon, but obviously we don't want to cut it too close,’ he told Israel’s Channel 2 news March 14, according to ABC News.

Prepping: Ahead of his visit to the country, Obama sat down with the Israel's Channel 2 news and discussed the hot topic of nukes in Iran

Israel’s concerns over Iran’s nuclear program are expected to be the major focus of Obama’s trip to the country.

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been vocal about his belief that Iran is developing nuclear technology at a clip much faster than what Obama describes and the differing timelines are expected to be a sticking point in talks between the two leaders.

In addition to outlining what US intelligence believes they know about the Iranian nuclear program, Obama made clear that his first course of action to stop Iran from building the bomb is through diplomacy.

The president called diplomacy ‘a more lasting solution’ and said this message is the same one he’s given to Prime Minister Netanyahu in the past.

Disagreement: While Obama said Iran could be capable of building a nuke in 'a year or so,' Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu believes they're much closer

All options: While Obama maintains his desire for diplomacy, last week Joe Biden said the president will use military action if forced

However, Obama also hinted that he’s prepared to take US intervention in Iran a step further than diplomacy.

‘I continue to keep all options on the table,’ he said.

Those options may include the military, if recent words from Vice President Joe Biden are any indication.

He said as much earlier in March while speaking to the powerful pro-Israel lobby American Israeli Public Affairs Committee.

No plans: Iran maintains its nuclear program is only for producing electricity at power plants like this one and has no plans for a nuclear weapons program

‘If God forbid the need to act occurs,’ Biden said March 4, ‘it is critically important for the whole world to know that we did everything in our power, we did everything that reasonably could have been expected to avoid any confrontation.’

Meanwhile, President Obama maintained that non-military tactics at limiting Iran’s nuclear program are ‘having a significant effect.’

The president also made clear in the interview, reports the New York Times, that Iran’s time to comply with international demands is finite.

‘There is a window,’ he said, ‘not an infinite period of time, but a window of time where we can resolve this diplomatically.’
