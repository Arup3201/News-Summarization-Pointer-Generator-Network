This two-levelled home which is exotic in it's style and vibrant in colour was featured in Belle Magazine in 2012, after Ben David, owner and creative director of the  linen design company Kas, purchased the property in 2009 and transformed the decor to an 'art deco, Singapore, colonial style' apartment. 

He said immediately he fell in love with the home, The Daily Telegraph reported. 

'It's a tropical oasis,' he said. 'It has a New York loft mezzanine; it looks over the living space.'

The 3-bedroom property has had a  history to attract celebrity owners. 

Before Mr David bought the property, Roger Melik from the Roger David Group has owned the home and before that it had been home to the Gold Logie winning Australian fashion personality, Maggie Tabberer. 

Enormous wooden carved doors in the dining room have been preserved since Ms Tabberer's residency.  

'They had to crane those door doors in... They will absolutely be staying here.' 

The property is expected to sell in the mid to high $3 million and is listed with Richardson & Wrench Elizabeth Bay and Bresic Whitney.
