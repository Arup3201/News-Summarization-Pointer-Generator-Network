A grandfather who previously spent every day eating junk food on the couch has shed three stone by becoming a bodybuilder.

Roland Burton began exercising after piling on weight following his retirement so that he would be able to play with his 14 grandchildren. 

The 65-year-old from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire joined a gym in an effort to get fit, and within three years was crowned the best in his age category at a bodybuilding competition. 

Roland Burton shed three stone and 18 inches through training to become a bodybuilder after setting a goal to get fit so he could play with his grandchildren 

Before losing weight, Mr Burton snacked on chocolate, crisps and biscuits while drinking endless of cups of sugary tea every day.

'I retired from my job as a car dealer and my days were spent on the sofa eating out of boredom,' he said. 

'I could rest a cup of tea on my stomach as it stuck out so much.

'I didn't do any exercise but I wanted to be able to play with my grandchildren properly and see them grow up.'

On a holiday in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, the former car dealer became 'transfixed' with weightlifting after watching a bodybuilding competition. 

'Once I lost some weight, I soon noticed a difference. For the first time in years, I could actually do my shoelaces up. 

'We went to the competition at the Atlantis Arena and I was transfixed. I knew straight away that I fancied having a go at bodybuilding.

The 65-year-old gave up his sugary diet and began training with a professional and his son in the gym every day

'I’d really been enjoying myself at the gym and thought training for a competition would push me.'

Despite his wife Margaret's concerns, Mr Burton began training with his trainer Paul and son Hal in preparation for a competition.  

'The competitors had six packs and huge muscles, while I was an old man.

'I trained in the gym for two hours a day, five days a week mostly doing weights and a bit of cardio. I could curl 55 pounds and could press 240 kilos with my legs.' 

While Mr Burton enjoyed his time in the gym, his reformed diet was less enjoyable. 

'To be honest, the food was boring. I was only eating steak, rice and vegetables. I wasn't allowed any of my favourite junk food that I'd previously gorged on, but it worked wonders for my self-control.

'For the last two months of the diet, I had to cut out carbs completely - which was really tough.'

As the competition grew closer, Mrs Burton dismissed her concerns and began helping her husband prepare by applying his fake tan. 

'I had to help Roland apply the fake tan. It was everywhere so we had to put old sheets on the bed to prevent orange streaks.' 

The grandfather's wife, Margaret, was concerned at first he may hurt himself but came around in time to help him apply fake tan before his first competition 

After retiring from his job as a car dealer, Mr Burton sank into bad eating habits and a lazy daily routine. 

He would spend hours in front of the television gorging on biscuits, crisps and chocolate, with scampi and chips his favourite meal. 

Endless cups of sugary tea went along with his food intake, and he did no exercise.  

After vowing to get fit, Mr Burton gave up his  stuck to a diet of rice, steak and vegetables. 

Initially just running, the 65-year-old began spending longer amounts of time on other parts of his body. 

He soon spent two hours in the gym, five days a week, curling 55kgs and pressing 240kgs with his legs.  

In just six months, Roland’s gruelling fitness and diet regime led to him losing an incredible 3st 7lbs, and  18 inches from his waist. 

And in his first competition in June, the grandfather was top  in the over 50s category.

'For the first time in my life, I have a six pack. Initially, I was worried because I didn’t want to look silly in front of the other competitors.

'But even my grandchildren were impressed. I felt great.' 

'My whole family watched me compete and cheered me on as I strutted my stuff on stage to my chosen song Rollin’ by Limp Bizkit.

'When I won, I couldn’t believe it - I didn’t think I’d have a chance.' 

'Bodybuilding changed my life and my body - my muscles looked great - and I’m much happier now.'
