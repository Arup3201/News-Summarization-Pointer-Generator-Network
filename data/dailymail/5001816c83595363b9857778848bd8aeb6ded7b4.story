Expectant mothers in New Jersey can choose to block their baby's father from the delivery room after a landmark court ruling on privacy rights.

Details of the ruling were released this week, but the case was heard last year when Steven Plotnick sued his ex-fiancée Rebecca DeLucciato to make her inform him when she went into labor.

Arguments in the case were heard up to the very last moment, with DeLucciato giving statements during a telephone conference as she had the baby.

Ruling: A judge says pregnant women have a right to exclude a baby's father from the delivery room

In their prenatel court battle - though to be the first of its kind - Plotnick wanted to ensure he would be told when his ex-fiancée had gone into labor, and that she would grant him access to see his baby at the hospital as soon as possible.

The couple had separated before their planned wedding last year, but Plotnick was determined to be a part of his baby's life.

When he ruled on the case in November last year Superior Court Judge Sohail Mohammed 
said all patients, especially pregnant women, had privacy rights that allow them to decide who can be at their bedside. 

The judge referred to two landmark Supreme Court abortion rulings - Roe v Wade from 1973 and Planned Parenthood v Casey in 1992 - to determine his case, stating that they show a woman has a stronger right over her body and unborn child than the baby's father.

'Any interest a father has before the child’s birth is subordinate to the mother’s interests. Even when there is no doubt that a father has shown deep and proper concern and interest in the growth and development of the fetus,' the judge wrote.

He added that by being at the birth, the father would have access to medical information about the mother that she may not want to share.

The ruling has been criticized by fathers' rights groups, who say it demotes the role of a man as being nothing more than a pay check.

Jeff Golden, of Fathers & Children’s Equality, told CBS Philadelphia: 'It’s a sad day for fathers, and for father's and men’s rights.

'The way we look at it is a child is born, a child had two parents and they should be two equal parents.'

DeLuccia's attorney, Joanna Brick, told NJ.com: 'They were estranged from one another at the time delivery was approaching, for quite some time. They weren’t communicating more than a little text here or there.'

Brick said the case came to its conclusion as DeLuccia was in the delivery room, where she later gave birth to a baby girl.

She added that the mother had planned to provide him access to the baby, but as a hospital visitor.

The father's attorney, Laura Nunnink, said her client never asked to be in the delivery room but had wanted to see his baby as soon as possible.

'He wanted to be a very involved father from the instant his child was born. It was important that he have the right to bond just as the mother would,' she said.

Plotnick does not plan to appeal the ruling and was able to see his daughter shortly after she was born.
