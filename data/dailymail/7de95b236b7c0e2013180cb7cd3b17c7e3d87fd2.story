A dog trainer from Pennsylvania recreated the car from the Dumb Dumber movie starring Jim Carey and the late Chris Farley and later starring Jeff Daniels as his woofing new business vehicle and more customers have already begun biting.

Matthew Kerr of St. Thomas wanted his new dog training business Matt's Mutts University to stand out so he created a personalized car based on the Mutt Cuts car from the 1994 comedy film Dumb and Dumber. He made his own versions called the Matt's Mutts car.

Kerr describes how he made the quirky car in a brief video posted by Public Opinion on YouTube.

The new Mutt Cuts car: Mathew Kerr, , certified dog trainer, created Matt's Mutts University mobile that resembles the car from the popular 1994 comedy Dumb and Dumber

The inspiration: Matthew Kerr was inspired by this car from the film Dumb and Dumber and later Dumb and and Dumber to starring Jeff Daniels as oppose to Chris Farley

Kerr says that he used six blankets to cover the vehicle which he simply pasted on with an adhesive.

His wife then stitched the ears and filled them with insulation.

'The nose was ingenious,' he says as he explains how he used an aluminium turkey pan from the dollar store. He smoothed it down and later painted it black.

'Matt's Mutts University offers personalized dog training and behavior modification services. The services are provided in the client's home so that the pet is in its own environment, and there is an emphasis on educating the pet owner during the training process,' says a write up of the new business in Public Opinion.

Kerr has 12 years of experience in dog training and started his business earlier this year. 

The Mutt Cuts car made a repeat appearance recently as well. 

It was nearly 20 years ago when fans were first introduced to intellectually challenged duo Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne.

And now finally two decades later Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels have returned to play the not-so-smart pair in Dumb And Dumber To.

On Monday the comedic actors arrived to the Los Angeles premiere of their film in character, wearing shiny suit jackets and pulling up in the infamous Mutt Cuts car that even Matthew Kerr would have approved of.

Woof you talking about?: Kerr said the inspiration for the spanking new business vehicle is loosely based on the Dumb and Dumber movie
