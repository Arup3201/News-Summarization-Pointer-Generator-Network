David Moyes showed he was game for laugh by joining the Ice Bucket Challenge phenomenon.

The Scot, who was heralded as 'the chosen one' before his ill-fated reign at Manchester United, took up the challenge after being nominated by one of his former players Marouane Fellaini. 

Moyes may not have had much to smile about recently but he took it all in good humour, and decided to nominate Everton midfielder Leon Osman, rock legend Rod Stewart and Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley.

A host of footballers and managers including Jose Mourinho, Luis Suarez and John Terry have been drenched in ice-cold water as part of the fundraising push for ALS.

The ALS Association helps encourage scientific research into the incurable neurodegenerative disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.
