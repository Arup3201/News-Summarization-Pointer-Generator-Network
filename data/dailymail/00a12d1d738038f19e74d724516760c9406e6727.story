Victor Anichebe and Youssouf Mulumbu were on target as an understrength West Brom side ran out 2-1 winners against Shrewsbury in Alan Irvine's first public game in charge.

The former Everton coach oversaw a behind-closed-doors victory against Bury on Saturday but this was the first chance for Baggies' fans to see their new manager in the dugout.

West Brom, who were without new signing Joleon Lescott, England international goalkeeper Ben Foster, Gareth McAuley, Chris Brunt and James Morrison, took the lead on 12 minutes through Anichebe.

Flying start: West Brom limped to a narrow win against League Two Shrewsbury in a friendly game

On target: Victor Anichebe gave the Baggies an early lead in their new home kit for the 2014-15 season

In front: Youssouf Mulumbu restored West Brom's lead before half-time after Shrewsbury levelled

Stephane Sessegnon found room on the wing before crossing for the former Everton striker to fire in firmly from close-range.

West Brom starting XI (4-2-3-1): Myhill (L Daniels HT); O’Neil (Baird HT), Dawson (O’Neil 87), Olsson (D Daniels HT), Pocognoli (Garmston HT); Mulumbu (Thorne HT), Yacob (Gardner HT); Berahino (O’Sullivan 79), Sessegnon (A Nabi 79), Roofe (Dorrans HT); Anichebe (Roofe 79).

Sub not used: Atkinson.Absentees: Gareth McAuley, Joleon Lescott (tight calves), Chris Brunt (groin), James Morrison (knee) and Ben Foster (extended break).Attendance: 2,831 (640 Albion)

But the Premier League outfit were pegged back by their League Two opponents when Ashley Vincent's left-wing run resulted in a cross that Scott Vernon slid home.

That equaliser fired the Baggies up and Sessegnon bagged his second assist of the evening, setting up Mulumbu with a fine pass and allowing the midfielder to score from 10-yards.

Belgian 
defender Sebastien Pocognoli went straight into the side after signing 
from Hannover at the weekend, but other new faces Craig Gardner and 
Chris Baird started on the bench.

Cameron Gayle, released by West Brom at the end of last season, started in defence for the Shrews.

West Brom wore their new home kit for the occasion.
