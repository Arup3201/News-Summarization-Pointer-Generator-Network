John Roberts, CEO and founder of ao.com, is worth £500m. He is pictured with his son, William, three, who will not inherit his father's fortune

An entreprenuer who made £500million when he sold the electronics business he co-founded will leave his fortune to charity - and his children will get nothing.

John Roberts, originally from Bolton, set up AO.com, previously Appliances Online, 14 years and has seen it grow to take a 24 per cent share of the online market for major domestic appliances in the UK, with the bulk in sales through its own website and the rest through third parties.

When it was listed on the London Stock Exchange in February it was valued at £1.2bn, netting him the incredible sum. But the 40-year-old is determined to follow his own father's example and ensure his children make their own way in the world.

Mr Roberts, known as the 'Kitchen King' told the Sunday Times: 'My dad's philosophy was: "I'll give you the best start in life I can afford and what you do with it is up to you", and mine's the same.

'[My wife and I have] been really conscious not to change anything. The kids are getting nothing.'

He said that he wants his five children, who found out about his fortune from media reports, to be 'happy' and 'normal' in their chosen careers.

His daughter has expressed a desire to become a teacher and he feels that she would struggle in her job if others discovered she was sitting on millions of pounds in inheritance.

Mr Roberts, who left school with no qualifications, now plans to set up a charitable foundation.

Bill and Melinda Gates have also vowed not to leave their £46bn Microsoft fortune to their teenaged children so they have a sense their own career is 'meaningful and important'.

Other celebrities to have taken the extraordinary step are Sean Connery, who says his son Jason will not inherit any of his movie millions, TV chef Nigella Lawson and Anita Roddick, the Body Shop founder who died in 2007 without leaving her fortune to her daughters.

Having worked for Moben Kitchens, Mr Roberts started the business after a friend bet him £1 that he wouldn’t take the plunge.

In an interview with Retail Week last year, Mr Roberts described how AO cut out the ‘convoluted’ supply chain involving a series of distributors to sell directly from manufacturers to consumers.

He said the brand initially competed by heavily undercutting the likes of Currys and Comet but later began to focus more on service.

He added: ‘We aim to put the customer first in everything we do and are fanatical about offering customers amazing service and competitive pricing.'

After the Bolton-based business was floated on the Stock Exchange in February, its value soared to a staggering £1.6billion.

Mr Roberts went home with £86million after cashing in 10 per cent of his near 40 per cent stake in the company.

The value of shares in his remaining 28.6 per cent stake rocketed by £113million to around £458million – making the 40-year-old the equivalent of nearly £3,500 a second during the nine hours of trading.

The total value of the company is now only just smaller than rival Dixons, which makes around 15 times more in annual profits.

Mr Roberts, a married father of five, started AO.com after a bet made in a pub when he worked selling kitchen appliances for a distribution warehouse.
