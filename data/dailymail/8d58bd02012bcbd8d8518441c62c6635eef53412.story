A solicitor has told of the terrifying moment she was savagely bitten three times in the face by a vicious dog as she tried to stop it mauling her eight-month-old puppy.

Michelle Parker, 43, feared her Pomeranian Toby was going to be killed when it was grabbed around the throat by the out-of-control dog - believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier – in a public park.

The mother-of-one watched in horror as the dog threw Toby around ‘like a ragdoll’ in Townhill Park in Southampton, Hampshire.

She was attacked by the dog when she leant down to try and pull the dogs apart and suffered a cut lip, bites to her right ear and bruising on her cheek.

She said her beloved puppy would’ve been mauled to death had she not stepped in to stop the savage attack.

She said: ‘I was walking along with Toby who was on a leash.

‘I heard some shouting and I heard the owner shout at his dog, which was running towards my dog at a million miles an hour.

‘Toby started to run off and he was quite scared.

‘I could not get hold of him and the dog was biting him and throwing him around like a ragdoll.

‘As I leaned down to pick him up, that was when the dog went for me and bit me in the face.

‘At the time my only concern was for Toby, if I had not stepped in he would have mauled him to death.

‘I was not concerned about me. The dog could have bitten my ear off for all I care, I just wanted to save Toby.’

The ordeal only ended when the owner grabbed the raging dog - which was not on a lead. The young man later fled the scene when witnesses asked him to give his details.
