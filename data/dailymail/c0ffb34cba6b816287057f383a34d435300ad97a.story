A motorcyclist's helmet camera has captured the frightening moment he was catapulted on to a car after the driver behind him failed to brake and ploughed directly into his bike.

Footage taken by the motorcyclist on a NSW street shows him slowing down behind a line of cars waiting at a set of traffic lights.

The man turns his head at the sound of screeching tyres behind him and witnesses the moment a p-plater driving a blue Mitsubishi Magna crashes into him.

The vision, which was uploaded to YouTube last month, shows the man flying several metres through the air before he lands on the hood of the white vehicle in front.

Glass from the back window of the car shatters from the weight and force of the motorcyclist's body.

The helmet camera keeps rolling as the car the man is lying on top of slowly drives forward to pull onto the side of the road.

'Got all kinds of f@$ked up by a P plater,' the man, known as madchodo on YouTube, said.

'I am all good now. Took a little bit to get back on motorcycles but it's my love and passion.'
