Two-day old Southern white rhino Bruce is learning fast to stay out of the way of his 630 stone mother.

The new arrival at Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling was almost squashed yesterday despite the fact he already weighs eight stone himself.

The once-endangered Southern white rhino is the second heaviest land mammal after the elephant and Bruce, who was born on Sunday, is expected to put on 1.5 stone a week for the next few years.

Bruce was named after Robert the Bruce in honour of the 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn

Mother Dot was pregnant for 494 days and kept park staff guessing after showing signs of labour as far back as July.

Bruce's eventual birth at 1.10am on Sunday was broadcast around the world via webcam.

He will live with Dot and another female, Lucy, for several months before being introduced to his father Graham in the spring.

The safari park, which closes for winter on November 2, said Bruce is expected to gain around 1.5 stone (10kg) every week during his first two years.

Southern white rhinos were at one stage considered extinct before a small remaining population was discovered.

The species, which is mostly confined to South Africa, now number about 20,000.

Bruce is just beginning to take his baby steps and is yet to form his rhino horn
