Kyle Van WinkleJust a normal guy: Kyle Van Winkle, 30, has been identified as the man who died in a parking lot outside Arrowhead Stadium

The 30-year-old father who died after a fight in the Kansas City Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium was found sleeping in a Jeep that was nearly identical to his own vehicle, it has been revealed.

Police are still baffled by the mysterious death of Kyle Van Winkle. A small amount of blood was found at the scene of his death, though there was no obvious sign of trauma.

It is thought that he was taken for a car thief when the owner of the Jeep returned to the parking lot with his young son and found Van Winkle asleep inside.

Detectives are now saying that Van Winkle, the son of a Missouri police sergeant and the father of a 7-month-old baby boy, left Sunday's Chiefs-Broncos game early and walked to the same row where he had been tailgating with his father and friends.

He then go into an unlocked Jeep that was ten cars away from the Jeep that he had arrived at the stadium in. It was a similar color and a similar model, as well, the Kansas City Star reports. 

The owner of the vehicle, who also left the game early with his 10-year-old son, found Van Winkle asleep in the vehicle.

A man who spent Sunday night in police custody in connect with the death of a man in the parking lot at the Kansas City Chief's Arrowhead Stadium is expected to be released later today

What happened next isn't clear - witness accounts vary wildly and police are still trying to track down the truth.

One witness says the owner of the Jeep fought with Van Winkle and saw Van Winkle throw a punch of the man.

Another witness says the owner called out for help from tailgaters who were watching the game on TVs in the parking lot - and several ran over to render assistance.

That witness told police the Jeep owner wasn't involved in the fight. Instead, it was the tailgaters who beat Van Winkle. The witness said he heard one of the tailgaters say that he had beaten Van Winkle and that he 'won't be doing that again.'

Van
Winkle's father, Dean Van Winkle, who is a police sergeant in 
Grandview, Missouri, said his son was not drunk when he left the stadium
and did not appear to be suffering from any health problems.

Mr Van Winkle was a loan operations specialist with a local credit union. He had played varsity sports in both high school and college and had no criminal record.

Medical authorities told investigators on Sunday evening they could detect 'no obvious signs of what caused (the man’s) death.'

'Talking to several witnesses that 
were out here in the parking lots, there was an individual who came back
to his vehicle, saw someone inside the vehicle that did not belong,' said Snap.

'A struggle ensued between the two. That's when the individual (who had been inside the vehicle) collapsed.'

Snapp said there were no obvious indications of how the death occurred. He had not been shot or stabbed, and hospital officials didn't find signs of a significant struggle on his body.

'We
don't know if the person had a health condition, had a heart attack. We
don't know,' Snapp said.

'We're going to investigate this as a homicide
until we hear differently. Right now it's a suspicious death but we are
going to investigate it as a homicide.'
