The Pentagon has unveiled plans to fully integrate women into all combat units by 2016, and women will be permitted to serve in all 
the most hazardous and elite units in the military, including Navy SEALS and the Marine Infantry.

This announcement comes after the January decision by former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta to allow women in combat.

The groundbreaking decision overturned a 1994 rule that restricted women from artillery, armor, infantry and other combat roles.

The restrictions haven't worked in practice: women have taken part in combat frequently in both Afghanistan and Iraq, and hundreds of thousands of women have been deployed to the conflicts in those areas.

Battle lines were blurred and women serving as medics, military police and intelligence officers attached to battalions found themselves in combat situations.

As of last year, more than 800 women had been wounded in the two wars and more than 130 had died.

At the time of the announcement in January, the Defense Secretary tasked the respective commanders the Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines and special operations to create a timeline for the full integration women into all combat units.

But not all leaders are sure about the plan.

Major General Bennet Sacolick says he's worried not about how women will perform but how men will react to having them in their units.

'We send a 12 men, or 18 or even smaller into very austere, remote environments, by themselves,' Sacolick, Special Operations Commander, told reporters.

'So I think we have to, you know, that complicates integration,' he said.

CNN reports that Sacolick wants to gauge current rangers, SEALS, green berets and their reactions to the idea of females in their ranks.

'The days of Rambo are over,' he announced, saying that the military today needs as much intellectual power as it does muscle, and that the concern is for women's health and welfare in male-dominated units.

By 2015, the army has planned to develop
gender-neutral physical standards for their Rangers that all soldiers 
will need to comply with.

Service branches have until January 2016 to decide which combat positions should be open to women, and any branches not opening certain positions to women will need to explain why and gain approval from the Defense Secretary.

The special forces units are the most grueling in the military, involving physically demanding and dangerous and emotionally taxing work. Any woman applying for a position in them would undergo rigorous testing and training - and most male applicants fail to gain positions.

In WWI and WWII women were utilized as test pilots for fighter planes as WASPs (Women Airforce Service Pilots). In 1979 enlistment qualifications became the same for men and women, but enlisted women were still prohibited from combat roles. In the Gulf War, some 40,000 women were deployed in operations, but in 1994, the ban on women serving in combat units was enacted.

'The department remains committed to removing all gender barriers wherever possible and meeting our missions with the best qualified and most capable personnel,' said the new Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in a May 21 memo to service leaders that was released today.

'I remain confident that we will retain the trust and confidence of the American people by opening positions to women, while ensuring that all members entering these newly opened positions can meet the standards required to maintain our war-fighting capability,' he said.
