Key witness: Tango the Labrador sat in the box as his owner's murder suspect threatened him with a bat

A dog has given evidence in a French murder trial.

Tango, a nine-year-old Labrador, was called to the witness stand to help determine who killed his owner.

In
 a preliminary hearing, the suspect was ordered by the judge to 
threaten Tango with a bat, as jurors noted how the canine reacted.

For comparison, a second dog of the same age and breed, Norman, was also called to the witness box in the French city of Tours to face the experiment.

Gregoire Lafarge, defending, blasted the 'unreasonable' and 'dangerous' proceedings.

He told RTL radio: 'So if Tango lifted his right paw, moved his mouth or his tail, is he recognising my client or not?

'I find it very troubling for the French legal system.

'If
 a judge ignores the demands of reason and surrounds himself with 
experts who are unreasonable, the system becomes very dangerous.'

But it is hardly the first time a dog has been called to the stand.

In 2008, a dog named Scooby created legal history as the first canine to appear as a witness in a murder case.

The
 animal's 59-year-old owner had been found hanging from the ceiling of 
her Paris flat. Police believe it was suicide but her family say that it
 was murder.

The dog was in the flat at the time of the death.

During a preliminary hearing in the city, the pet was led into the witness box by a vet.

A suspect in the case was presented to the dog, to see how it reacted.

It is said to have 'barked furiously'.

In 2012, a court in Charlotte County, Florida, took a similar approach by sending a subpoena to a German Shepherd in a drugs case.

The canine witnes was presented with suspects and drugs as vets responded to hit reaction

And last month a vet was asked to analyse a Dalmatian's physical reactions as it sat in the witness box faced with two murder suspects.

Dog behaviourist Jacques Cordel has blasted the activity as 'illegitimate'.

He wrote in French magazine Nouvel Observateur: 'This
 expertise plays on popular beliefs, but has no scientific foundation.

'Ethology [animal behaviour study]
 is real science, it is no joke.'
