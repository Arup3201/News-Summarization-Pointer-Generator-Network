Have you seen her? Video has appeared on the internet of this woman abusing a young child

Agents from the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) are appealing for help to catch this woman who is suspected of producing child pornography and to rescue the vulnerable youngster she was filmed abusing.

U.S. Immigration and Customs were alerted after a video appeared on the internet showing the woman, who is believed to be between 23 and 29, engaging in explicit sex with a four to five-year-old victim.

Investigators believe the footage was uploaded on or around November 27, raising fears that the child could still be being exploited.

The woman is of medium build with hazel or green eyes and brown hair with blond highlights. She has a mole on her left thigh and a tongue piercing with a white round stud with a pink dot.Â 

It is believed the video was made in the U.S.,and that both victim and abuser are in the country.

Investigators from Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigation team received a tip-off about the film from Danish Police.

A criminal complaint and arrest warrant has been issued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Footage in which they 
appeared was submitted to the National Center for Missing & 
Exploited Children, the national clearinghouse for child sexual 
exploitation material.

Anyone with information about the 
latest abuser or her victim should contact the agency immediately by 
calling the ICE Tip Line on 866-347-2423, which is staffed 24-hours a 
day, or filling out an on-line tip form at www.ice.gov.

Warped: The 'Jane Doe' abuser is believed to be between 23 and 29. She was filmed engaging in explicit sex with a four-to-five year-old victim

Appeal: The woman is of medium build with hazel or green eyes and brown hair with blond highlights. She has a mole on her left thigh and a tongue piercing with a white round stud with a pink dot

The HSI are hoping to build on the 
success of a similar appeal earlier this year which led to two arrests 
and the rescue of two children.

The
ICE Homeland Security Investigations is responsible for investigating 
crime connected to the illegal movement of goods and people into and out
of the United States.

Agents target criminal networks smuggling people and drugs across America's borders.

It has 6,700 agents spread throughout 200 American cities and 47 overseas outposts.

Michael Serapis Freeman, 39, and Michelle Lee Freeman, 40, surrendered to police at their home in Salem, Oregon after
learning an acquaintance had identified Michelle from a photo 
circulated the HSI.

Previously
only identified as 'Jane Doe,' Michelle Freeman's picture was extracted
from video and photos allegedly showing her victimizing the two girls, 
Homeland Security Investigators said.

Michael Freeman admitted to taking 
nude photos of his 9-year-old daughter while performing sexual acts on 
her to the witness of his 6-year-old daughter.

He described himself having been in a 'bad place' when manufacturing the content and trading it on a photo sharing website.

Caught: Michael Freeman, 39, and Michelle Lee 
Freeman, 40, surrendered to police after learning an acquaintance had 
identified Michelle in photos released by the U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement (ICE) in August

A
scan of that website by the MailOnline shows lists of users providing 
photos of young boys and girls, many described being under the age of 
18, in provocative poses coupled with similarly fueled comments.

Michael Freeman said he engaged in this file swapping of his daughter with another user for approximately one month.
