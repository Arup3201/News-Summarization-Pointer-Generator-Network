All but one of the footballs caught up in the Deflategate controversy were hardly under the regulation limit at all, according to an NFL report.

Eleven of the twelve footballs were 'just a few ticks' away from the minimum pressure of 12.5PSI, according to an internal investigation into how footballs used in the AFC title match ended up too flat.

The revelation pulls some of the air out of allegations that the Patriots tried to get a competitive advantage over the Indiannapolis Colts in their AFC title match which secured their spot in the Super Bowl.

Denied: New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has protested innocence and ignorance over the gameday balls in the match which secured his team's Super Bowl spot. He is pictured above at the fateful game, holding one of the under-inflated balls

'Nothing to do with me': Patriots coach Bill Belichick has also attempted to exonerate himself

A report on the NFL Network, drawing sources from the official investigation, made the revelation.

They found that one ball was significantly under-inflated - by two PSI.

It had been speculated that somebody in the Patriots camp could have wanted the balls to be under-inflated to aid the team's playing style.

Less pumped-up balls are easier to catch, but harder to throw long distances.

The Patriots have declared total innocence of any foul play, with senior figures saying they had never even given a thought to the notion that the balls' internal pressure could be significant.

It has also been pointed out that cold temperatures, which would reduce the balls' pressure naturally, could have played a part on the day.

The league's official investigation continues. The last statement from NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said: 'we have made no judgments'.

The NFL Network report also revealed that an elderly man who worked for the Patriots took the bag of 12 footballs into a restroom shortly before the game. He was inside for 98 seconds, though it is unclear what, if anything, may have happened.

The investigation sources also appeared to back up claims from Patriots coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady that they had no idea what happens to footballs before a game starts.
