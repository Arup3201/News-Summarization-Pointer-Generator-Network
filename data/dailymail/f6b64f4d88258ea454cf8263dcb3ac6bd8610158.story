A dozen Cabinet ministers have been caught out ignoring David Cameron's ban on taking mobile phones into meetings.

Blackberries, iPhones and other handsets were banned from Cabinet meetings in 2010 over fears they could be hijacked by foreign spies to listen in on top level discussions.

But when security chiefs went to brief ministers on efforts to tackle cyber-terrorism, the Prime Minister was alarmed to find at least 12 had broken the rules.

David Cameron ordered a phone 'amnesty' for ministers to come clean about their secret phones before the GCHQ briefing could begin

On Tuesday, the head of the Government's eavesdropping agency GCHQ attended Cabinet at 10 Downing Street to brief ministers on cyber-security.

Director Robert Hannigan was due to update senior ministers on progress in implementing the Government's Cyber Security Strategy.

But when ministers were reminded that they should not have their phones in the room, many were forced to admit they were secretly trying to break the rules.

Mr Cameron announced a 'phone amnesty', according to the Mail on Sunday. 

'He told the Secretaries of State and others present, that everyone had one minute to leave the room and dispense of any phones they had brought in. Almost instantly, a dozen ministers guiltily rose to their feet,' the newspaper added.

Michael Gove, who last month disrupted a Cabinet meeting when his email and text enabled-watch started playing a Beyoncé song, also had to remove the gadget.

Some ministers had to hand in more than on phone, and only once the mobiles had been removed from the room could the briefing begin.

The £860 million five-year Cyber Security Strategy - which was published in 2011 - sets out measures to safeguard Britain's economic prosperity, national security and way of life by building a 'more trusted and resilient digital environment'.

It aims to make the UK one of the most secure places in the world to do business online, by tackling cyber crime, promoting resilience to cyber-attack and helping to shape an 'open, vibrant and stable' cyberspace.

Downing Street refused to discuss the content of Mr Hannigan's briefing.

But a spokesman did reveal that there was no discussion in Cabinet of the recent incident in which a hoax caller managed to speak to Mr Cameron.

Downing Street and the security services launched a major review of procedures following the breach, although Mr Cameron has said nobody would be sacked and no crime was committed.

The Prime Minister revealed the call came after he returned from Saudi Arabia to pay his respects after the death of King Abdullah and he was enjoying a 'very nice walk' with his family when his mobile rang.

He said: 'I had Florence on my back to add to the exercise regime that I'm undertaking. My Blackberry went in my pocket, I answered it and it claimed to be a conference call established – which I do obviously very frequently – between the head of GCHQ and some of the staff in my office. 

'A voice came through, a voice I didn't recognise. The voice said he said he was sorry to wake me up, which I thought was strange as it was eleven o'clock in the morning, and so I quite rapidly asked 'who is this?', to which the answer came 'it is a hoax call', and so I pushed the red button on the Blackberry which ended the call.

'That is what happened so no harm was done, no national security was breached, but it is important when these things happen to make sure we do everything we can to put in place systems to we weed out hoax calls, but every now and again, I suspect these things will happen'.  

The call followed a separate astonishing security lapse earlier in the day when a caller, believed to be the same man, was given a mobile number for GCHQ director Mr Hannigan after he rang the organisation.
