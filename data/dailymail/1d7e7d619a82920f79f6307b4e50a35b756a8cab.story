Classic paintings have been brought to life by an animator who has created a film of moving artworks.

Italian Rino Stefano Tagliafierro took around 100 images and brought them to life using the 2.5D effect.

Sometimes the images move subtly with the addition of water moving across Emerald Bay in Thomas Hill's painting of Lake Tahoe or more dramatically in the blinking child of William Adolphe Bouguereau's The Difficult Lesson.

The Execution of Lady Jane Grey, an oil painting by Paul Delaroche that hangs in the National Gallery in London, has also been brought to life in the Italian artist's nine-minute animated paintings video called Beauty

The 34-year-old experimental animator and director behind the clip lives and works in Milan.

He used the 2.5D effect, also known as the 'animated photo effect', which can be created in software such as After Effects or Final Cut.

Called Beauty, the series of images set to music move from landscapes, to portraits as well as more gruesome battle and execution scenes.

One of the more graphic pieces animates Judith Beheading Holofernes by Caravaggio which was painted in 1598-99.

The animations sometimes move subtly but enough to make the images feel more alive, especially here in William Adolphe Bouguereau's L'Innocence

Writing on his website, Mr Tagliafierro says: 'These images which the history of art has consigned to us as frozen movement can today come back to life thanks to the fire of digital invention.'

The artist studied at ISIA - Higer Institutes for Industrial Arts in Urbino and at IED - European Institute of Design in Milan.

Included in the nine-minute clip are Caravaggio's Binding of Isaac and The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt as well as several artworks spanning several different periods.

The Execution of Lady Jane Grey, an oil painting by Paul Delaroche that hangs in the National Gallery in London, has also been brought to life.

Mr Tagliafierro has been internationally rewarded for his work including accolades at the Video Art & Experimental Film Festival New York and the Atlanta Film Festival 2013.
