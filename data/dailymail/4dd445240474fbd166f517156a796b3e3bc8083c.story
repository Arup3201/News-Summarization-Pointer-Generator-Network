An alarming number of young women are misinformed when it comes to contraception, according to new research. 

Bayer HealthCare have released results from a survey of 1,500 British women aged 25-34 that reveals a number of myths continue to exist around family planning.

The survey suggests that better communication may be needed during GP consultations to help women understand the variety of contraceptive options available, with only 58 percent of women saying their doctor had explored all options with them.

Oh, baby: Many young women are risking unwanted pregnancies due to a lack of awareness on contraception

Many of the women were risking an unwanted pregnancy as one in 10 believed it's impossible to get pregnant during their period. Meanwhile if condoms weren't available, a quarter had heard of faith being put in 'alternative' barrier methods such as cling film, latex gloves or even a plastic sandwich bags. 

Meanwhile, 17 per cent of women had relied on the withdrawal method in the past.

As a result of using no or insufficient protection, 30 per cent had needed to take the morning after pill.

Despite recent scares over the increased risk of blood clots when taking some contraceptive pills, the Pill remained the most popular method of contraception, as four out of five of the women surveyed had taken it at some point and nearly half (48 per cent) said it is their most regular form of contraception. 

But results indicated that some may be selecting the Pill as a 'default' option due to low awareness of alternative methods.

Nearly a third of women had never heard of the hormonal implant, 27 per cent had not heard of the contraceptive injection and more than a third were unfamiliar with the intrauterine system (IUS or 'hormonal coil') and the intrauterine device (IUD or 'copper coil').

Default option: Many women are using the Pill because they don't know enough about alternatives

Just under half of women did not realise that intrauterine methods are placed in the womb and can be removed at any time. 

Of the 15 per cent who had considered using an intrauterine method but decided against it, nearly one in five had done so due to a lack of information.

Dr Diana Mansour, consultant in community gynaecology and reproductive healthcare at Newcastle Upon Tyne, said: 'The healthcare professional has an important role to play in ensuring that all contraceptive options are discussed with women, including Long-acting Reversible Contraceptions (LARCs), which offer convenience and reliability as women do not need to think about taking them every day. 

'Many women might be surprised to hear that LARCs are more effective in practice than user-dependent methods such as the Pill and have a number of additional lifestyle benefits. 

'Despite many women expressing clear preferences for the qualities associated with LARC, use of these methods is low and women could be selecting the Pill merely as a default option.'

You can't get pregnant while on your period

The withdrawal method is a fool proof method of contraception

You can't get pregnant if you have sex standing up

Contraception…that's basically just the Pill

Household items make great barrier methods

Cola is an effective spermicide

Long acting reversible contraceptives can't be removed

With awareness of LARC methods so low, it's unsurprising that only 36 percent of women surveyed had ever tried a LARC method and less than 1 in 10 had tried an intrauterine method. 

This is despite expressing clear preferences for features associated with LARC methods: 77 percent of women said they would like a method they did not need to think about regularly and 67 percent would prefer a contraceptive to last several years.

Additional knowledge gaps and misconceptions identified in the survey concerned the use of certain LARC methods in specific groups of women. 

For example, nearly half of women did not know whether an IUD, an IUS or an implant can be used in younger women or whether it can be used in women who have not had children. Some were also unclear about when fertility would return and many thought that it would take several months. However, fertility returns to the women's usual level within a matter of weeks with all these methods.

Natika Halil, director of health and wellbeing at sexual health charity FPA, said: 'This research highlights some important knowledge gaps and misconceptions that continue to exist around contraception. 

'At FPA, our aim is to encourage positive conversations between women and healthcare professionals to ensure that all methods are communicated and any myths are accurately dispelled. Greater awareness of all the available options, including LARC, could not only help to reduce rates of unintended pregnancy, but also help women in search of a contraceptive that could suit their needs more than the method they may be using.' 

The FPA have information on all methods of contraception on their website and have a tool where users can identify which would suit them best, visit www.fpa.org.uk
