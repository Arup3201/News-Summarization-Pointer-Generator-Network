Yoko Ono has told how being blamed for The Beatles’ split made her feel like she was on trial for murder.

She said: ‘It feels like I was accused of something that I didn’t do, which was breaking up The Beatles. It’s like you’re accused of murder and you’re in prison and you can’t get out.’ 

Since the Fab Four broke up in 1970, Miss Ono has been blamed by many fans for their demise because she was in a relationship with John Lennon.

Yoko Ono has said being blamed for the breakup of The Beatles was like being on trial for murder

The couple moved to New York a year later so they could work more 
closely on the burgeoning peace movement. Lennon was shot dead in 1981.

In an interview with a US magazine, Ono reflected on the years since the band broke and added the allegation left her feeling that she ‘wasn’t valued by people’ and that the only 
way to cope was to take the hatred directed at her and ‘turn it around 
into love’.

She said: ‘Not being appreciated for 40 years or something...It feels 
like I was accused of something that I didn’t do, which was breaking up 
The Beatles.

‘That was like being somebody who is in prison without 
having done anything wrong. It’s like you’re accused of murder and 
you’re in prison and you can’t get out.

Paul
 McCartney recently made up his long-running feud with the 80-year-old 
artist and insisted that she didn’t break up the band.

Speaking to Rolling Stone he said: 'If John loved her, there’ s got to be something. He’s not stupid.’

And Miss Ono said that only now does she feel accepted again after 40 years of ‘not being appreciated’. 

'It's like you've been knocking on the door for 40 years and then someone suddenly says: 'You don't have to knock on the door - the door is already open.'

‘Oh...Okay! So how are you going to deal with that? And I have to be 
very cautious. It’s better that you’re criticised than complimented as a
 person.'
