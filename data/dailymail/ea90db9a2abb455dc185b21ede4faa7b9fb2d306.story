A nine-months pregnant teenager who claims she was raped by seven men in Sudan is now facing the death penalty after being charged with adultery.

The married Ethiopian woman was just 18 years old, and three months pregnant, when she was subjected to the attack in August last year.

She says she was searching for a new home in Omdurman,Â  near the capital Khartoum, and one of the seven accused lured her into an empty property on the premises of renting it out to her and her husband.

She was attacked and held down while a
 group of men, reportedly aged between 18 and 22, took turns in raping 
her, according to the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of 
Africa (SIHA) network.

Her 
ordeal was filmed by one of the perpetrators and was circulated on 
social media via WhatsApp several months after the attack.

When
 the video of the rape surfaced, the woman and the alleged rapists were 
arrested and accused of making and distributing indecent material and 
indecent behaviour.

After 
first being denied bail, and later charged with prostitution and 
adultery, the woman is now being prevented from making a formal 
complaint of rape.

Sudanese 
media reporting the case has tried to undermine the woman's story by 
claiming she has HIV and is a prostitute, SIHA said.

'The
 intention to place culpability on the part of the victim is of great 
concern and seeks to deflect and reduce accountability of the 
perpetrators, but more disturbing is that the charge of adultery carries
 with it the potential sentence of death by stoning if found guilty,' 
SIHA said.

'There have 
even been cynical attempts to falsely claim that the men were accidently
 prescribed hallucinogenic drugs by a chemist beforehand.'

'Impunity
 and silence on crimes of sexual violence committed against IDPs 
[internally displaced persons], migrants and impoverished women in Sudan
 has been a pattern for years,' Hala Alkarib, regional director of the 
SIHA network, told the Guardian.

'Successful
 prosecution of rape is the exception as opposed to the norm and most 
certainly does not reflect the level of incidence.

'Instead victims face 
the risk that they will instead be prosecuted for adultery, being 
re-vicitmised by the judicial system, and threatened with the ultimate 
sentence of death by stoning.'

According
 to SIHA, the Attorney General has denied her the right to report the 
rape as she is currently under investigation for the other charges.

The Attorney General also argues that she should have reported the rape at the time of the attack.

However
 the woman has told her lawyer that the group of men who attacked her 
threatened to kill her if she told anyone, and as a result, she was too 
scared to report it.

She was
 further deterred by the fact that she told a police officer who found 
her shortly after the attack what had happened, who dismissed her story.

The
 police officer decided against pursuing an investigation as it was Eid 
Al Fitr, a public holiday in the Muslim country, SIHA said. He has been 
charged with negligence.

The
 teenager was arrested on the 17th of January and despite being close to
 giving birth, she has since been sleeping on a concrete floor in a cell
 at a local police station.

Two attempts to secure bail for her on health grounds have been refused.

A
 total of ten individuals, including another police officer who helped 
spread the video, are currently on trial related to this case.
