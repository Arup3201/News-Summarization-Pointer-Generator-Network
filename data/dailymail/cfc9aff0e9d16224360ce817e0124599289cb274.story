It seems the spirit of Ebenezer Scrooge is alive and well... in a small town in East Yorkshire.

Council officials in Goole ordered the top of a 30ft Christmas tree to be lopped off - because it blocked a CCTV camera.

The tree went up earlier this month in the town centre, reaching the dizzy heights of the 90-year-old clock tower next door.

Blocked: The camera had less than a good view after a 30ft conifer was placed next to it in the town centre

But the tower has a CCTV camera placed on top - which the conifer completely blocked.

So Goole Town Council had the top removed, leaving many residents scratching their heads.

Former trawlerman Donald Walker, 70, said: 'Why couldn't they just take a bit off the bottom before they put it up, not take the top off? Where is the star going to go?

'They took it off because the camera couldn't see the shopping precinct,' he added. 'It
 looked like about five-and-a-half foot they chopped off the top, which 
is a shame because it looked like the biggest tree we have had.

The conifer was sourced from the 
country estate of Castle Howard in North Yorkshire, an hour away, and transported specially to the town square.

Town clerk Brian Robertson denied there was a problem - telling regional newspaper The Press that the tree had been 'shaped' so it would still have a triangle on top.

He added: 'I wouldn't say it was five-and-a-half foot that was taken off. We sent the contractors out there with radios and they liased with the control room as to how much to take off.

'The view of the camera was totally obscured by the tree so it had to be taken off.'

A town of 20,000, Goole is on the River Humber and has one of the most important ports on the east coast.

Its clock tower was erected in 1926 to celebrate the town's centenary - but sits slightly unceremoniously on a roundabout.
