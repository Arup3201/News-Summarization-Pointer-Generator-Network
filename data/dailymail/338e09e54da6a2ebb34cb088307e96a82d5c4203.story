UEFA has rejected appeals by Serbia and Albania after their European Championship qualifying match was abandoned when a drone flying a political banner flew into the stadium.

UEFA's appeals body on Tuesday upheld the original disciplinary sanctions: Albania forfeited the match for refusing to play on, and Serbia was deducted the three points from a 3-0 win by default.

Play in Belgrade on October 14 was stopped when a drone carrying an Albanian nationalist banner hovered above the pitch.

A Serbia player pulled the banner down and Albanian players tried to protect it. In the resulting disorder, Serbian fans attacked Albania players.

Historic tensions between the countries were fuelled by Kosovo, an ethnic Albanian-dominated province, declaring independence from Serbia in 2008. 

UEFA also ordered Serbia to play two home qualifiers in an empty stadium.

Serbia lost the first of those matches last month, 3-1 against Denmark. Their next home match in Group I is against Armenia on September 4.

In the five-team group, Denmark and Portugal currently hold the two automatic qualifying places for Euro 2016 in France.

Albania is in third place, which guarantees at least advancing to a playoff. The Albanians have four points from three matches, three ahead of fourth-place Serbia.

The Balkan countries are scheduled for a return match in Albania next October 8.

UEFA also fined both federations 100,000 Swiss Francs.

The double-headed eagle, as featured on the Albanian flag, is imposed upon so-called 'Greater Albania' where ethnic Albanians live.

The word 'Autochthonous' refers to Serbia's alleged attempts to control Kosovo despite not being indigenous to the region.

The man on the left is Ismail Qemali, founder of the Albanian national movement and the modern Albanian state as its first head of state and government.

On the right is Isa Boletini, a nationalist figure who fought in the Albanian Revolt in Kosovo in 1910 and later in World War I against Serbia.
