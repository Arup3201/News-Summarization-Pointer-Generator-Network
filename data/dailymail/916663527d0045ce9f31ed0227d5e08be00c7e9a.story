Pain and sadness were almost palpable in Staten Island today as the community said a final farewell to a New York City firefighter killed in the line of duty.

Amidst a crowd of sombre uniformed men and grieving women stood Lt Gordon 'Matt' Ambles' two little girls, Gabriella, 7, and Giovanna, 5, each of them wearing one of dad's old fire helmets.

Thousands of uniformed firefighters from across the country gathered for the funeral of the fallen fireman who the mayor said was ‘a true hero.’

Lt. Ambelas died Saturday night searching for victims in a burning, cluttered Brooklyn high-rise apartment building. His was the first Fire Department of New York line-of-duty death in more than two years.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said during his 
eulogy that the 40-year-old FDNY veteran was dedicated, hardworking, 
kind and, above all, a family man.

'All members of the FDNY but really, all New Yorkers, are feeling this moment with pain and sadness because we’ve lost a true hero,' de Blasio said. 'Our city is inspired by his courage and deeply saddened by his loss.'

Real-life hero: Lt Ambelas was a 14-year veteran of the New York City Fire Department who only recently was honored for saving the life of a seven-year-old boy

That theme was poignantly accentuated when fire helmets from Ambelas’ old commands were placed on the heads of his daughters Gabriella, 8, and Giavanna, 5.

While ‘no one feels it more than the family that has suffered this loss,’ said the mayor, ‘all members of the FDNY - but really, all New Yorkers - are feeling this moment with pain and sadness, because we’ve lost a true hero.’

Ambelas had been promoted to lieutenant 10 months ago. Throughout his career he helped the city through its darkest hours, including the recovery from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and Superstorm Sandy.

'Matt was the best of the best,' firefighter and friend Eric Bischoff  told 7Online. 'He died a hero - that's how he lived.'

Firefighters from Boston, Philadelphia and St. Louis were among those who traveled great distances to salute Ameblas’ casket.

It was lowered from a caisson draped 
in a department flag and taken into a Staten Island church by 
pallbearers, followed by his wife, Nanette, and their little girls.

'How
 do I say goodbye to you Matt?' Ambelas' widow wrote on Facebook. 'You 
were my everything, and the rock of this family. I want more time.'

Mrs Russo Ambelas had a close friend read her eulogy honoring her husband on her behalf, Staten Island Advance reported.

'How
 am I supposed to breathe without you? Ten years with you just wasn't 
enough...you gave me the best part of you, our girls,' the grieving 
mother of two said in her statement.

'I will never let you go...you were taken too early from a family that loved you and need you... I will be counting the time until I am in your arms again.'

Refering to her oldest daughter, Gabriella, she said the 8-year-old girl made the most sense of what happened, promising the mother to take care of her now that her hero dad was gone.

Following the funeral service held at St Clare's Church, the firefighters were lined up for miles as he was transported for a private burial.

Ambelas is the 1,444th New York City firefighter to die in the line of duty since the department’s founding in 1865.

Fateful night: Emergency personnel from the New York City's fire and police departments work at the scene of the Saturday fire at a public-housing high-rise building that claimed Ambelas' life

Ambelas, 40, died Saturday night after suffering multiple injuries while on the 19th floor of the 21-story building in Independence Towers complex owned by the New York City Housing Authority.

Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro told reporters that Ambelas sustained multiple injuries after he went into an apartment on fire to look for victims.

He was found unconscious inside of the apartment and was removed by fellow firefighters, de Blasio said.

'Ambelas went into the apartment to search for life and did not come out, and by the time his brother firefighters found him, it was too late for him,' Nigro said.
