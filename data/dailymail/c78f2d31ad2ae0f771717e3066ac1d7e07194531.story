A Thai Airways plane heading from Sydney to Bangkok was forced to make an emergency landing in Bali after a broken window was discovered in the cockpit.

The Boeing 747 was en route to Bangkok on Tuesday afternoon when it made the emergency landing at Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport at 4.50pm.

The broken cockpit window caused a decrease in cabin pressure for the 272 passengers on board flight TG467.

There were no reported injuries and the plane's pilot Ivtas Dejkunjorn safely landed the aircraft in Bali, an airport spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.

The flight and its passengers have been grounded in Bali overnight. They will head to Bangkok first thing Wednesday morning.

'Passengers have already been cleared through immigration and have been put up in hotels near the airport for the night,' the spokeswoman said.
