Her TV programmes have shown the nation how to create a beautiful home from treasured items that have been handed down through the generations or upcycled and recycled to find a new use.

And now Kirstie Allsopp has opened the door to her own Notting Hill, West London, house to show she really does practice what she preaches. 

From the living room sofa that has been inherited, to the kitchen tops that were once used in a science lab, the wardrobe now used as kitchen storage and the fireplace that once caused her to burst into tears, Miss Allsopp's home is full of quirky collects.

And it should come as no surprise, as the face of shows such as Kirstie's Homemade Home and Location, Location, Location, the property expert knows a thing or two about transforming a living space.

She and her partner Ben Andersen bought their London house, a 1950s property, in September 2006, a few months after her first son Bay, now nine, was born and set about turning it into a home.

Talking about her house, which was once two flats which have been knocked together to create an open and airy family home, Miss Allsopp, 43, who also has a son Oscar, seven, and is step-mother to Ben's two sons, said: 'I can't think of anything that hasn't got some sort of story behind it.

'Someone asked me if I designed all this, but it's not like that. It comes together over time. You get things all the time and you are adding and taking things away.'

Here Miss Allsopp who will be hosting The Handmade Fair, sponsored by Hobbycraft, later this year in September, shows how she has brought them all together to create a unique living space for her family.

Kirstie's sofa, above, is on its way out as according to the TV star it 'has got a huge tear in it'

Living room sofa

'That sofa has now got a huge tear in it. They are so old these sofas. Ben got them years ago, before he met me even. They weren't always here. He doesn't like buying new sofas so we just sort of move things around. But I am actually going to have to basically get either a new sofa or swap this for another type of sofa soon.'

'Once you know you're not going to just buy something new, once you've made that decision – and I hate calling it an ethical decision because that makes it sound like you are really up your own bottom, but we have made an active decision not to go out and buy new things. That decision has been made.'

The 'Blue Peter' fire place

'I was pregnant with my first child and Ben took me to the Goldborne Road and there was this fireplace that he loved. I burst into tears because I just didn't know what else to do. It was a disgraceful performance on my behalf. 

'I wept "please no, let's not buy that fireplace"'. I was so ashamed at my lack of backbone. "I really don't think we should buy this fireplace", I kept saying. I was so ashamed of myself. 

'I bought the fireplace for a lot of money. I said to Ben "I've bought the fireplace, when you have a building which needs a new fireplace and everything else, you can put it in and you are bound to need it at some point. I'm sorry I cried, it's a beautiful fireplace. I just don't want it in my home."' 

Kirstie admits she 'wept' when she first bought the fireplace above, as she 'didn't want it in her home'

'Then we were moving in here but it wasn't ready by the time Bay was born so I went down and stayed in Devon for a bit and Ben came up during the week to supervise the works. When I came back from Devon, there was the fireplace…'

'My mum used to call it the Blue Peter fireplace. The one thing I dread is that he finds whatever is missing from the middle bit. It's some God-awful piece of brass and I hope he doesn't ever stumble across it.

'No, but I'm very fond of it now. It's very baronial, I think that's the word. For a while there was a glass sword hung up there on a nail. I've taken it down now. And look, there's an invitation to an event in 2014 up here. That's how often I sort it out.'

Kitchen

When they bought the flat downstairs, they had a reshuffle of rooms and turned a bedroom into the kitchen and made it open plan with what is now the dining room. They kept most of the kitchen furniture such as the worktops and the aga.

'These worktops are from a school science lab. Ben got hold of them. Look, if you look closely you can still see the marks where the old Bunsen burners would have been attached,' sats Kirstie.

The larder and things inside

There are all sorts of useful bits and bobs in the larder.

Kirstie says: 'It's not looking so tidy at the moment because we've just shoved things in here. My sister always says she wants to be here in a nuclear winter. You could live off this for a long time.'

Inside, there is a wicker basket with separate compartments for bottles which she bought recently in Holmfirth.

Kirstie explains: 'This is apple juice from Devon, from home. We've got an orchard. There's a place just up the hill that has a big apple press. You pick the apples, take them up there, they press it and sent it back to you and you keep the bottles for the next time.

'I'm a big picnic person. I bought these (huge silver flasks from stews etc) back from Kenya. There, 46 per cent of people don't have running water. So the supermarkets have loads of picnic stuff. 

'They have loads of family gatherings with lots of picnic stuff. You can put a stew in there. I like winter picnics. Some people on twitter said 'nobody has winter picnics…but they are absolutely brilliant.

Kirstie's larder is so full, above, that her sister jokes she wants to be there in a nuclear winter 

Kirstie, who is dyslexic, points out a sign she wrote with a spelling error: 'Please keep the larder this way, Thak You'

'[In here is] Ben's deep fat fryer. He's not allowed to switch it on in the house. He has to go and plug it in outside by the BBQ. It stinks - the smell of deep fat frying - you can never get it out.

'Actually, it needs a bit of a tidy up in here. It's not as tidy as it usually is.'

She points to a small picnic basket with jubilee design: 'This is my pride and joy. Do you remember the royal concert for the jubilee? Well we had a couple of tickets and everyone there got their own picnic basket. They are so good.'

'The brilliant thing about this room is that is keeps everything in it.

'There's hot chocolate from Switzerland. When we go we always drive and we pick it up from the co-op there.

'I made this sign when the larder was nice and tidy and then I managed to write 'thak you' on the sign. Look at that, 'thak you' [Kirstie has dyslexia].

The wardrobe in the kitchen

'We bought that together actually and it works incredibly well. Again, I think kitchen storage is incredibly important. We had to take careful measurements to make sure it would fit under that beam,' says Kirstie.

Kirstie says: 'I bought that in Bath when I was on my own. If I buy things on my own, it always gets shifted all over the house and Ben never accepts that he likes it.'

Kirstie loves her kitchen wardrobe, above, and says that she thinks kitchen storage is very important

The new fridge

'This is my new fridge. I've had three second hand fridges. If someone buys one of Ben's buildings we just have them from there so we never throw them out. The light in the fridge kept tripping the other day and our housekeeper said "Oh, be careful, the fridge was giving everybody electric shocks,"

'So I said: "No, that's enough! I want a new fridge!" This is new, new, new, sparkly new. It's Fisher and Paykel. Look at the layout. I love it. Look at the ice tray, everything is there. Ohh, there's lamb in the freezer there from Devon. We have our own sheep down there. It's a great layout, I'd recommend it to anyone.

'We are really lucky. I earn a fortune, Ben earns a fortune. We are not buying things second hand because we can't afford to. And we are not pretending to. We couldn't have second hand fridges because we couldn't afford them, it's just that Ben didn't want to waste a perfectly good one just because you didn't pick it. In a way, because you take time to make decision over things, it takes time to sort things out.'
