Chris Lilley's titular character in Jonah From Tonga has been branded 'racist' and 'creepy' by members of Australia's Tongan community, as backlash continues to mount against the comedian's controversial new TV series.

Jonah, who featured in Lilley's previous series Summer Heights High, is portrayed with brown face make-up, an over-the-top Polynesian accent and contempt for school authority figures - breeding the catch phrase: 'P**k you, Miss!'.

But not everyone is a fan of the boisterous Tongan teenager's depiction in Jonah from Tonga - a co-production between the ABC, BBC and US cable network HBO - with a new a social media campaign hitting back at the stereotypes of the Pacific Island character.

However the ABC has played down the furore over the character, which it says makes 'an observation about the narrow-minded attitudes' expressed by some of the show's characters.

Hitting back at the negative stereotypes: A young Tongan-Australian woman has launched a social media campaign, calling-out Chris Lilley's racist depiction of her community in Jonah From Tonga

Taking to Facebook and Instagram, two young Tongan women have photographed themselves with protest signs.

'This post is to Stand up to the stereotypes of how Pacific Islanders are being perceived as within the TV show #JonahFromTonga,' Leitu Havea wrote on Facebook.

On the sign, she notes that she is a proud Tongan, has never been imprisoned, was never suspended from school and is currently studying at university.

At the time of publication, the post had been liked by 594 people.

'AMEN!! Absolutely disgusted by this show. Feel confident in knowing that you are not alone in knowing how inaccurate and inappropriate stereotyping in the media is,' commented one of Leitu's friends.

Leitu is not alone in calling out the television series, and it's creator, as racist.

Prinnie Stevens - a former contestant on The Voice Australia and proud Polynesian herself - has applauded the #ProudPoly movement.

'I have always despised the stereotypes that society put upon us as Tongans/Polynesian people,' she posted to Facebook.

Similarly, SBS radio presenter Meliame Fifita took issue with the show following it's premiere, saying it was misrepresenting Tongans.

Speaking with the Australia Network last week, Professor Helen Lee, head of La Trobe University's department of sociology and anthropology, labelled the show 'just awful'.

'A 40-year-old white man, dressing up as a 14-year-old Tongan boy in brown face is just inherently creepy,' she said.

'It just seems like a deeply self-indulgent exercise where he just enjoys inhabiting these characters'

'I don't think it's permissible,' she claimed, 'I think it's appalling and I don't think he should be allowed to do it.'

Not happy: Australia's Pacific Islander community are unhappy with Chris Lilley's 'satirical' representation of them

It appears as if audiences are beginning to tire of Chris Lilley's negative stereotypical depictions as well.

Only 287,000 Australians tuned in to watch Jonah From Tonga on Wednesday night, down from 414,000 last week and a far cry from the 1.6 million viewers Summer Heights High had for it's series premiere.

Do you think Jonah From Tonga is racist?

'Jonah from Tonga plays with stereotypes, but it’s doing so to make an observation about the narrow-minded attitudes expressed by some of its characters, including Jonah’s own,' Rick Kalowski, Head of Comedy at ABC TV, said.

'It’s also worth noting that while Jonah himself might be a heightened comic character, virtually every other Tongan or Islander character in the series is presented as a well-rounded, believable person without comic traits'.

Chris Lilley has been contacted for comment.

We Can Be... Offensive: Chris Lilley's imitations of Asian-Australian physics student by day, turned musical theatre nerd by night, Ricky Wong, and snobby private school girl Ja'ime King - who both featured on his first comedy We Can Be Heroes - didn't come without controversy

Flamboyantly cringeworthy: Summer Heights High's Mr G had plenty of people calling the ABC's complaints line with the musical he wrote about a girl who died of a drug overdose, and while Jonah is Lilley's first brown face, S.Mouse had Lilley donning the even more offensive black face in 2011's Angry Boys
