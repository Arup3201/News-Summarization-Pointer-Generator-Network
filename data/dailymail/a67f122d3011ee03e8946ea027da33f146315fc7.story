Eva was born by emergency Caesarean on August 4 -  nine days late -Â  at the Jessop Wing maternity unit in Sheffield, South Yorkshire,

She is so big she has already almost outgrown newborn clothes.

First-time mum Miss Slavin, 20, says her grand entrance has left relatives puzzled as there is no history of large newborns in the family.

She said: 'We call her the big whopper because Sam and I met at Burger King.

'We've no idea where her size comes from because neither I nor Sam were big babies, it's come out of nowhere.

'We knew she was going to be a big baby but not quite that big.

'When the doctors said how much she weighed we were just in shock.

'She's long and she's got big feet too. She will be in clothes for babies aged three to six months soon. She is doing really well and we are chuffed to bits.'

Eva's grandma, mum-of-four Carol Slavin, who has become a grandmother for the first time, added: 'It's a lovely story that they met at Burger King and now they've had their own little Burger King whopper.

'Danica had to have an emergency Caesarean because the doctors were scared Eva might get stuck.

'Danica was only 6lbs 13oz so Eva is the first whopper. But she is absolutely gorgeous.'

The couple met at Burger King two years ago.
