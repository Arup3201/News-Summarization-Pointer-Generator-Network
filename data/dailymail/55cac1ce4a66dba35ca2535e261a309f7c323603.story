A couple who let their pet dog's hair become so long he could not see from behind his matted fringe have been banned from keeping animals for a decade.

Long-haired mongrel Rocky had to be sedated to be clipped after RSPCA officials discovered his dirty, matted fur.

His owners Jason Antony Arnold, 43, and Kerry Ann Webber, 31 both pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges at Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court in Dyfed, Wales.

Rocky's hair was so long he could not see from behind his matted fringe, according to RSPCA officials

They were ordered to pay £500 costs plus a £60 victim surcharge each and were told they must carry out a total of 130 hours unpaid work.

Arnold admitted he did not take steps to ensure the needs of a long haired cross in terms of a suitable environment, diet and access to fresh drinking water.

The couple both pleaded guilty to failing to protect him from pain, injury, suffering and disease. 

RSPCA inspector Keith Hogben said: 'Rocky was so matted the poor dog could not see. He had to be sedated to clip him properly.

'Just brushing him daily and a clip would have sorted this out. It is very sad it had to come to this. If you are not coping just ask for help.

'He is such a nice and friendly dog and will now be rehomed.'

Arnold was given 90 hours of unpaid work and Webber was given 40 hours.
