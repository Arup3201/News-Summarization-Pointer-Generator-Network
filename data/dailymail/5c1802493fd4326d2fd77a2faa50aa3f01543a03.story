Arsenal's goalkeepers are stepping up their preparations for the new season using an innovative training technique.

Wojciech Szczesny, along with Damian Martinez and youngster Matt Macey, are being put through their paces during the club's pre-season camp in Austria.

The method sees the shot-stoppers with a strap around their waist, tied to one post, before hurtling themselves across the goal to improve their agility.

VIDEO Arteta expecting great season  

Szczesny will have to hit the ground running this season if he is to retain the No1 shirt following the arrival of David Ospina from Nice.

The Colombian World Cup star cemented the interest of Arsene Wenger during this summer's tournament in Brazil and prompted the Gunners to spend £3.2million to acquire his services.

'He is a great goalkeeper, very skilful,' Ospina told Arsenal.com of his rival for the spot between the sticks.

'He has been a regular at a top side like Arsenal, so he is quality. We also have the Argentine goalkeeper Damien Martinez. They are both young players but very experienced.'
