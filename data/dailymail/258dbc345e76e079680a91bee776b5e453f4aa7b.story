Tennis star Serena Williams has posted a photograph of herself curled up under a blanket after being forced to drop out of Wimbledon with a 'virus illness'.

The tournament was host to dramatic scenes yesterday as the 32-year-old broke down on court and was forced to withdraw in the middle of her doubles match alongside sister Venus.

After emergency court-side medical checks delayed the match by more than 10 minutes, Miss Williams was given the go-ahead to play, but was forced to stop a short time later after serving four consecutive double faults.

Thankfully the women's world number one appears to taking things much easier today, posting a photograph on both Twitter and Instagram showing her sleeping on a sofa under a pink blanket.

According to the Guardian, Miss Williams' coach and boyfriend Partrick Mouratoglou said he had not spoken to the 17 times Grand Slam champion 'for a couple of days'.

However as she left the grounds of the All England Club last night he was said to be by her side.

During the match the younger Williams sister looked dazed, and playing as if she had never before picked up a racket.

Her
 following serves were all double-faulted – variously sent into the net 
and long – and at 0-40 to opponents Kristina Barrois and Stefanie 
Voegele umpire Kader Nouni came down off his chair to check on the 
32-year-old’s fitness.

During the delay, one of the Williams'
 other sisters, along with Serena's agent and her hitting partner, left 
their seats in the stands. 

Serena
 and Venus walked to the sideline holding hands, and Nouni announced to 
the crowd at No. 1 Court: 'Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, Miss 
Williams has to retire.'

Serena wiped away tears as she walked toward the court's exit.

There was little option for the sisters to abandon the contest to allow Serena to seek assistance for the problem

Pam Shriver, working in her capacity 
as an ESPN analyst, was on court and said it was one of the stranger 
episodes she had seen.

'You
 can have reasons not to feel right on the court but nothing that would 
make you not be able to hold the ball in your hand or catch the ball 
after a bounce or throw the ball up,' Shriver said. 'You might hit four 
double faults in a row but you'd make contact.'

Shriver questioned: 'Is this a drama? Is this an act? If you're not well, you need to get help.'

At 3-0 behind the Williams sisters, who have won the Wimbledon doubles title five times, decided against taking the match any further.

In an emailed statement, Serena said: 'I really wanted to compete, but this bug just got the best of me.'

Williams added that she looks forward 'to returning to Wimbledon next year.'

Venus added: 'Unfortunately, Serena 
has been feeling unwell for the past few days and she just couldn't play
 to her potential today.

'I'm really proud of her for trying, because we just love playing doubles together.'

In
 her service game, the star was struggling to bounce the ball and keep 
it under any semblance of control, and the first two double faults at 
the beginning of her first service game highlighted the difficulties she
 was experiencing.

She was unable to clear the net at that point.

The crowd cheered 'Come on Serena' but a third double followed and, although the 32-year-old had managed to get the ball into the opposite half of the court, her direction was all off.

She had earlier called for the trainer before the match began after struggling through the warm-up.

The American pair, who have each won five
 Wimbledon titles individually, were knocked out of the singles in the 
third round last week.

Teenage sensation Nick Kyrgios dumped two-time champion and second seed Rafael Nadal out of Wimbledon to reach his first grand slam quarter-final.

The 19-year-old Australian condemned Nadal to a 7-6 (7/5) 5-7 7-6 (7/5) 6-3 defeat, completing three miserable years at Wimbledon for the five-time finalist.

The Canberra native got the better of the 14-time grand slam champion and current world number one, to book a last-eight clash with Canada's Milos Raonic.

And German ninth seed Angelique Kerber ended Maria Sharapova's hopes of winning a second Wimbledon title in the fourth round.
