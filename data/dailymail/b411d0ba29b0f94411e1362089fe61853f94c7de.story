Alan McWilliams, 41, died after apparently playing a game of Russian roulette 'for a laugh'

Father-of-three Alan McWilliams, known to friends as Alpy, has died after he apparently shot himself playing a game of Russian roulette with a friend

A neighbour told the Scottish Sun 
newspaper that Mr McWilliams had been 'playing Russian roulette with a 
pal and the gun went off'.

Another local added: 'Folk are saying Alpy was playing Russian roulette for a laugh.'

On
a Facebook page set up by his partner Andrea Henderson, the couple's 
daughter Lisa posted: 'Glad I got to stay with you until the end and 
hold your hand.

'Still hasn't sunk in, devastated. Rip dad love you lots.'

His
other daughter Keri added: 'Missing you more than words can say, 
totally broke. Hasn't hit me, feels like I am just waiting on you to 
phone me and give me in to trouble.

'Nothing is going to be the same without you, but you will never be forgotten. Rest in peace up there big guy.'

Strathclyde Police said they were treating the death as 'unexplained'.
