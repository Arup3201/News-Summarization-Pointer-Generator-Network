Smiling for the camera, Robin Gibb and his wife Dwina chose to mark the first anniversary of their marriage with a gypsy themed party.

Had the Bee Gees’ brilliant lyricist survived his battle with cancer they would today  be celebrating 31 years of wedded bliss.

Instead, two years after his death, Mrs Gibb is announcing the release of her husband’s last album.

Titled 50 St Catherine’s Drive – the address of the house where Gibb was born in Douglas on the Isle of Man – the album is a collection of songs mainly recorded between 2006 and 2008 but never released and the final track on the album, ‘Sydney’ is also the last one recorded by Robin and is a demo version.

Explaining its inclusion, Mrs Gibb, 61, who released the wedding anniversary picture from her personal family album, said: ‘Robin composed this late at night, in August 2011, at our home, The Prebendal. He used the bedroom keyboards and then Garageband on an I-Pad.

'He wished to finish this song in a studio with Barry, for a new album he hoped they would record together, but his health prevented this. 

'He missed his twin brother Maurice who had passed away; but when he closed his eyes, the three young brothers were back in Sydney, Australia, happy together with their dreams and hopes for the future. Their future creations of course affected the world. 

'This fragment of song is poignant, wistful, beautiful and unfinished. It belongs on this album as one of his last works. He cried when he wrote it, and I wept when I heard it.'

Gibb passed away in May 2012 after contracting pneumonia while battling against cancer of the colon and subsequently of the liver.

The multi-millionaire had valiantly fought the disease, even astonishing doctors as he came out of a coma weeks earlier. Gibb’s twin brother Maurice died from the same bowel condition that initially led doctors to operate on him.

His musical career began when he formed the Bee Gees with his brothers Barry and Maurice in 1958.

The group is among the biggest-selling bands of all time with hits spanning six decades including Stayin’ Alive, How Deep Is Your Love, Massachusetts and Night Fever.

Born on the Isle of Man, the Gibbs moved around Britain as their father, a struggling musician, sought work to feed his five children.

Maurice and Robin started singing harmonies at the age of six, practising in the bathroom. In 1958, the family emigrated to Australia, where the three elder brothers launched their recording career.
