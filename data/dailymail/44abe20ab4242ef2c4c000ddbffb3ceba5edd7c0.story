A rare woolly mammoth skeleton has been sold at auction for £150,000 ($236,000).

It is one of the best preserved skeletons of such an Ice Age beast ever found, and measures an incredible 11.4ft (3.5 metres) high and 18ft (5.5 metres) long

The 500,000-year-old specimen called Monty was bought by an unnamed private buyer.

The mammoth, dubbed Monty, (pictured) was found after spending around 100,000 years under the ice in Siberia, and was put up for auction by Summers Place Auctions in Billingshurst, West Sussex. The beast is thought to have weighed up to six tons and was sold to a private buyer £150,000 ($236,000)

Monty was found after spending around 100,000 years under the ice in Siberia, and was put up for auction by Summers Place Auctions in Billingshurst, West Sussex. 

The beast is thought to have weighed up to six tonnes.

Curator Errol Fullor said it was unusual for a nearly complete skeleton to come on the market for sale.

The skeleton had been part of a private collection in Eastern Europe, but had not been assembled and mounted until it was prepared for auction.

Curator Errol Fullor said it was unusual for a nearly complete skeleton to come on the market for sale. The inside curve of the tusks is approximately 8ft (2.4 metres) and the specimen is thought to be a male

Monty was expected to sell for up to for £250,000 ($409,000).  

'Imagine the mammoth covered in fur - long fur on top with a shorter undercoat - and although quite similar to today's elephant, it had smaller ears and a shorter tail to minimise frostbite and heat loss, so it was well adapted for the ice age,' said Mr Fullor.

'Its habitat was the mammoth steppe, stretching across northern Eurasia and North America, so its diet was mainly grass and sedges, which explains why it only had four molar teeth, and also stunning long, curved tusks.' 

The woolly mammoth is thought to be a male. 

James Rylands, of Summers Place Auctions, said: 'What's exceptional about this one is it's more or less complete with two magnificent tusks. There are one or two toes missing. 

The woolly mammoth co-existed with early humans, who hunted them for food and used their bones and tusks for making art. 'To the best of my knowledge, I don't think there has been one sold at auction, certainly not in the UK and I don't think in Europe, so it's a first in that respect,' said auctioneer James Rylands

Back from the dead? Scientists hope to bring woolly mammoths back from extinction

Woolly mammoths could be brought back from extinction after a preserved body of one of the ancient animals was found frozen in the snowy wastes of Siberia, scientists hope.

The mammoth, which took its last steps around 40,000 years ago, is in such good condition that biologists believe they may be able to clone the creature.

An autopsy of the Ice Age beast, which has been nicknamed Buttercup by scientists, will be shown in a documentary later this month.

The Channel 4 programme will also examine pioneering work on cloning the woolly mammoth, which is taking place in South Korea and the US.

Scientists hope that, eventually, they will be able to reintroduce the huge creatures back into the wild, tens of thousands of years after they became extinct.

Insung Hwang, a South Korean geneticist, told the Independent: 'Bringing back the mammoth either through cloning or genetic engineering would be an extremely long process. We're trying hard to make this possible within our generation.'

That's why we have to start discussing the implications now. Some of our colleagues are still working on analysing the genome from Buttercup's specimen. This is a long and complicated process that is unlikely to be finished anytime in the near future.' 

'It looks very impressive, the inside curve of the tusks is about 8ft (2.4 metres). It's bigger than an elephant.'

'To the best of my knowledge, I don't think there has been one sold at auction, certainly not in the UK and I don't think in Europe, so it's a first in that respect,' said Mr Rylands. 

'It's not like a number 14 bus, there isn't going to be another one coming along.' 

Last year, a diplodocus skeleton sold at auction for more than £400,000 ($654,000).
