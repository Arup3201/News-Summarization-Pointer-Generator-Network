A 58-year-old teacher  was found with 5,000 photos of teenage boys at his school, in a cache of 60,000 indecent images of other children stored on his computer.

Timothy Arthur, who claims he has never had a sexual relationship, was caught as part of an international investigation into the sale of child abuse materials by a Canadian company.

As well as 86 extreme images of children being raped, tortured or abused with animals, he had a further 59,477 indecent images and two movies.

Timothy Arthur claims he did not know the images he had stored of teenage boys at his school were illegal 

Timothy Arthur, 58, was found with 5,000 images he had taken of teenage boys at the Grange School, Bristol 

Among these were 5,000 photos of boys aged 14 to 16 at the Grange School in Warmley, Bristol, where he worked part time. 

Bristol Crown Court heard all the schoolboys he photographed were clothed and had been aware of the pictures being taken by him.

Arthur admitted 11 counts of making indecent images of children but escaped prison with a suspended sentence.

The court heard that during the investigation into the sale of child abuse material Arthur was identified as a customer of the firm by police in Toronto who handed his details to the UK National Crime Agency via Interpol.

Arthur bought DVDs, CDs and downloads between December 2007 and December 2010 with over 70 containing indecent images of children.

David Scutt, defending Arthur, said the teacher accepted he had an 'unhealthy obsession' with the material and claimed he had bought it without realising it was illegal. 

Timothy Arthur hoarded 5,000 photos of teenage boys alongside 60,000 indecent images of other children 

Arthur had the images of the boys in a file of 60,000 indecent images of children - some of them being raped 

He said: 'He is a 58-year-old man. He has never had a sexual relationship. He is particularly naive.'

Mr Scutt added that Arthur had been working only part time at the school and resigned as soon as he was arrested in February.

Recorder David Bartlett said some of the images would not on their own be classed as indecent but he could not ignore the higher level images and the sheer number involved.

He said: 'If you take the unhealthy obsession with this material then it shows that the relatively innocent stuff can't have been obtained innocently.'

Arthur, of Bristol, was given a one-year suspended jail sentence for his crimes, which are thought to have spanned over a three year period.

He was also given a 24-month community order, supervision and a 15-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning him from working with children.
