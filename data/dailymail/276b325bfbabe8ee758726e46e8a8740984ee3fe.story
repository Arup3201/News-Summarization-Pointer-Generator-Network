On the eve of Apple unveiling its iPhone 6, Amazon has announced its Fire Phone will now sell for just 99 cents with a two-year contract.

The retail giant will be hoping to lure customers away from Apple with the Fire phone's 3D screen, 13MP camera, and a year's free Amazon Prime membership.

That and the new price, which has been slashed drastically from its original $199.

Price cut: The Fire Phone will now be just 99 cents with a two-year plan, down from $199

This new deal, announced earlier today, is only available though AT&T. 

Amazon has been struggling with the new phone, moving just 35,000 units in the product's first 20 days, compared with Apple, who sold 9 million iPhone 5S and 5C's in their first 3 days on the market,

The Fire Phone comes with a unique screen that uses four cameras built into the front of the phone that track head movement.

These cameras and movement sensors position images on the screen to create a 3D, holographic effect.

Amazon calls it Dynamic Perspective and claim it is one of the reasons the Fire Phone can challenge rivals such as the iPhone.

New release: This is all happening the day before Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 6

This 4.7-inch screen has a 720 x 1280 resolution, and a 315 Pixels Per Inch (PPI), compared to the iPhone 5S' 640 x 1136 resolution, and 326 PPI.

The Amazon Fire phone also has a 13MP rear-facing camera, a 2.1 front-facing sensor, plus a minimum of 32GB of storage.

The new phone also aims to beat its rivals by taking full advantage of Amazon’s popular, existing services, with its Firefly feature.

This app lets users scan food, DVDs, music and games, and instantly link to the product on Amazon.

Critics of the phone claim that this app is just another way for the company to sell their products by instantly linking to the Amazon site.
