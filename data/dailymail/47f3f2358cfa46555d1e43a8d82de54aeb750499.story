A woman who was worried about her grandmother when her flight became delayed at JFK airport used the help of a stranger on social media to make sure she was alright.

Leila Wons' 88-year-old grandmother Rosa Levy had been traveling from Argentina to Boston to visit her family.

But when her granny's connecting flight was severely delayed  at JFK airport she began to panic when she could not locate her and put out an S.O.S on social media for help.

Grandmother: Rosa Levy, 88, had been traveling from Argentina to Boston to visit her family but her family became worried after her flight was delayed at JFK airport

‘She was going back to her home [Argentina] and from Boston was supposed to connect from New York,’ Wons told ABC news.

‘She was supposed to get to the flight to Argentina at 10 p.m. and it was delayed to 8 a.m. the next morning.’

‘It's difficult for her to communicate,’ Wons said. ‘The issue was that the airline didn't keep a record of what hotel they were sending her to and we couldn't find where she was.’ 

Wons, who does not live close to New York, used social media to connect with former students at her old college - Wellesley College - to ask for help.

Soon, Maryann Ford, 47, a fellow Wellesley alumna who lives in Manhattan, read Wons' call for help via social media.

Ford told ABC News: ‘I was on my way to sleep and a Wellesley friend tagged me in a post, asking if I could help.’

‘I got out of my PJ’s, threw on some sweats, and hopped in a cab to JFK to find her.’

Deserted: With a digital picture of Wons’ grandmother in hand, Maryann Ford asked if anyone had seen Rosa Levy in the near-empty airport

Found: After a few phone calls airline employees helped Ford, left,  locate a surprised Rosa Levy, right,

With a digital picture of Wons’ grandmother in hand, Ford asked if anyone had seen Rosa Levy in the near-empty airport.

She was in luck when airline employees, got in touch with a Holiday Inn, where she called for police assistance to help find Levy.

Wons said: ‘It was 4 a.m. and my grandmother was getting on the shuttle to the airport. That’s when Maryann saw her.’

After putting their worries at ease, Wons said Ford's act of kindness made her feel incredibly grateful, especially as they had never met each other.

She said her grandmother had been visiting the country every one to two years for the past 20 years but had never experienced any real delays, so Ford's gesture put their minds at ease.

‘She’s an angel,’ said Wons. ‘I couldn't have imagined that somebody I never met would do this.’

But Ford thanks social media.

She said: ‘Social media made this possible it was so great to continually check this thread and read the suggestions people made on what my next move should be, and how I could find this person.’

‘It didn’t matter if I didn’t know [Wons] or her grandmother because this isn't about me. I feel like this is kind of what we are supposed to be doing in this world is helping each other,’ Ford said.
