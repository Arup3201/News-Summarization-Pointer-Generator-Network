The body of Marcy Satterlee has been recovered from the devastating mudslide in Snohomish County, her eldest daughter said today.

Nichole Webb Rivera believes that her 61-year-old mother had been found but had no official news yet from the Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office.

The mother-of-five told MailOnline today: 'At this point, it is much less tragic to find a body than to find a soul who had been suffering since Saturday.'   

Recovered: Rivera's mother, Marcy Satterlee, (seen here with her husband Thom) has been found among the debris of the Washington landslide - much to her daughter's relief

Mrs Rivera, 39, who grew up in Darrington, is waiting for news of her father Thom, 65, her daughter Delaney, 20 and Delaney's fiance Alan Bejvl, 21, who also went missing on Saturday when the mile-long mudslide tore through the small town of Oso, an hour north of Seattle. 

Marcy Satterlee, a grandmother to six, had been married to husband Thom for 41 years and the couple lived in the area for three decades.

The Satterlees, who moved to their home on Steelhead Drive in 2012, had planned to spend Saturday, making wedding plans with her grand-daughter Delaney and fiance Alan.

Heartbroken: Nichole Webb Rivera learned the horrific news about her daughter and future son-in-law and her parents, Thom and Marcy Satterlee, in a Facebook message from a friend

Mrs Satterlee was beautiful and hysterically funny, her daughter told MailOnline. She was also a talented artist who loved to be outside, working on her garden close to the river.

Authorities have found as many as 25 bodies but expect the number of fatalities to rise over the next few days. 90 people are still missing and authorities are unsure whether another 35 were in the area at the time.

Rivera was teaching a class when she first found out about the Oso mudslide through a Facebook message from a friend in her home town.Mrs Rivera, 39, who grew up in Darrington, Washington, but now lives in Texas, said that it was a few hours later, after numerous calls went to unanswered, that she realized with growing dread that her daughter Delaney, the 20-year-old's fiance Alan and her parents were among the scores of people missing.

Lost: Delaney Webb, 20, and her husband-to-be are listed among the missing and presumed dead in the Washington mudslide

Delaney Webb, 20, and her husband-to-be Alan Bejvl had driven up from their apartment in Everett, Washington, to visit her grandparents Thom and Marcy Satterlee last weekend.

The young couple, who got engaged last October, had been planning to go over their summer wedding plans.

Mrs Rivera, a mother-of-five, told MailOnline today: 'I stayed up all night listening to a police scanner online. My ex-husband and two sons drove up to Oso when they first heard but were turned back by rescuers.

'By Sunday morning, I knew that I had to be there. I'm the eldest child and Delaney is my oldest daughter, so I bought a one-way ticket.'

Although Mrs Rivera said that she always holds on to hope, the reality she believes is that her family are gone.

'We lost four,' she added.

Striking beauty: Delaney's grieving mother described her daughter as the 'most beautiful, sweetest girl with the biggest heart'

She described her daughter Delaney as the 'most beautiful, sweetest girl with the biggest heart. I am blessed to have had her for 19 years'.

She said that Delaney's fiancé, Alan, who is also from the Snohomish County, 'would be next to the Wikipedia entry for a perfect man.’

'He was respectful, had a good sense of humor, was a lovely young man. He and my daughter were crazy in love and so happy together,' Mrs Rivera said.

'I'm just grateful that they went together and on a high note in their lives.'

Her father, Thom, a Vietnam veteran who spent many years recovering from PTSD, was brilliant with a 'heart the size of that mudslide.’

Mr Satterlee, who had 52 first cousins, even more second cousins and 6 grandchildren, would have helped anyone he could, especially in a disaster situation like this, his daughter said Wednesday.

Dashed hopes: The 20-year-old bride was set to 
walk down the aisle in the summer, and she traveled to Oso, Washington, 
over the weekend to talk about the wedding plans with her grandparents

Marcy Satterlee was remembered by her daughter as beautiful and hysterically funny - 'she would make you wet your pants laughing' - as well as a talented artist who loved to be outside, working on her garden.

Mrs Rivera's remarkable show of strength is in part for the sake of those around her.

She said her two teenage sons Sam, 17, and Jarron Webb, 14, had said little since the disaster.

'It's hard to tell with teenagers', the mom added.

Her sons and their elder sister, Delaney, also just lost their stepmom in January.

Delaney also has two other half-sisters who are desperately waiting on any news.

Mrs Rivera, who lives in Houston with her husband, Vince, and their son aged five and two-year-old daughter, said that the eldest girl asks constantly for Delaney.

Hoping against hope: Nichole Webb Rivera said she knows her daughter is likely among the dead, even though the family are still praying for a miracle

The mother has explained to her that her big sister is missing, to which she responds that 'she doesn't want her sister to be died,’ Mrs Rivera said.

She said that the elder members of the family are 'beside themselves with grief,' but that they are praying and coming together to make decisions about what next steps should be taken as they wait for news.

Mrs Rivera, who is a textile artist with her own bespoke quilting business, has set up a fundraising page which has raised close to $17,000.

Mrs Rivera said that 'in the spirit of my dad who hated bureaucracy' she was organizing to have the money shared directly with those affected by the mudslide tragedy.

She said that fundraising was a way she could show her own gratitude to all the volunteers and rescuers in Darrington who have gone out into the field to recover their families, friends and neighbors.

'We take care of our own, that's what we do up there. People have hearts of gold.'I want  to do something to show that I love them,' she said.

Despite her own devastating losses, Mrs Rivera still holds on to her sense of hope.

She added: 'I am hopeful that something will come from this whole tragedy.

'It shows that helping people is powerful and it's possible. I'm hopeful the community will recover and thrive and be stronger than before.'

Search crews using dogs, bulldozers and their bare hands kept slogging through the mess of broken wood and mud again Wednesday, looking for more bodies or anyone who might still be alive nearly five days after a wall of fast-moving earth destroyed a small rural community.

But authorities have acknowledged they might have to leave some victims buried because trying to recover every corpse would be impractical and dangerous.

Previously, authorities said they believed they had found 24 bodies from the slide that swept through a rural area north of Seattle on Saturday, though not all had been removed from the area.

The debris field is about a square mile and 30 to 40 feet deep in places, with a moon-like surface that includes quicksand-like muck, rain-slickened mud and ice. The terrain is difficult to navigate on foot and makes it treacherous or impossible to bring in heavy equipment.
