A mother-of-two from Canada who unknowingly bought a winning lottery ticket worth $50 million in Canadian dollars before losing it has been tracked down by lottery officials.

Kathryn Jones, a 55-year-old married engineer, forgot that she had ever purchased the ticket from a Shoppers Drug Mart in Cambridge, Ontario last year and went on to misplace it.

So she was stunned when officials from the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation knocked on her door in Hamilton to reveal that she had the jackpot - which comes to about $46.88 in U.S. dollars.

'We weren't sure we wanted to let 
them in the house,' Jones said at a press conference. 'Then they showed us 
their ID, so they came in and sat down and started asking a number of 
questions.'

Found! Kathryn Jones, 55, from Hamilton, Ontario, has been tracked down as the winner of a $CAD50 million lottery jackpot. She is pictured revealing her win at a press conference on Tuesday

Investigation: Officials from the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation found out when and where the ticket was bought and identified Mrs Jones through surveillance footage

And their news - that she had become a millionaire - is still sinking in, she said.

'As you can imagine this has been a very
weird and wonderful journey,' she said during Tuesday's press conference, CTV News reported.

'I feel almost as though I have been 
struck by lightning twice because first to win is pretty incredible, but
then to lose a ticket and then to have OLG find me and take the 
initiative to actually contact me is also pretty incredible.'

OLG President and CEO Rod Phillips explained at the press conference that officials investigated after the massive jackpot lay unclaimed last year.

'A great story': Richard Jones and his wife have not yet decided what they will spend the money on

They found out when and where the winning ticket had been purchased and used surveillance footage from inside the shop to match it to the winner - Mrs Jones.

Then they verified the purchase through her credit card records after she provided investigators copies. She said it was fortunate that she used her card as she usually pays cash when she plays.

The investigation was further complicated when she revealed that her sister owns a shop that sells lottery tickets, sparking a review by the Alcohol and Gaming 
Commission of Ontario.

'The case of this outstanding $50-million
Lotto Max jackpot is one of the most unique in OLGâ€™s history,' Phillips
said. 'I am pleased that we are one step closer to awarding this 
multi-million dollar prize.'

Mrs Jones added of the investigation: 'There was no reason they needed to do this, but they did, and I'm very appreciative.'

She said that even when she heard about the unclaimed prize, she never thought she could be the winner. She said she was busy at work and with Christmas planning so she was focused on other things.

The prize will be officially presented to her in January and until then, she said she is not thinking of the money as hers.

'You
try to brace yourself for "maybe this isn't going to happen",' she 
said. 'I am still in shock... I completely respect OLG's rules and 
processes. I now anxiously anticipate the end of the wait period.'

Jones said she does not know how she 
will spend the money - but that her two grown children with her husband 
Richard are warning her to keep her feet firmly on the ground.

'My son gave me a lecture on being 
responsible,' she said, adding that her children, who are both in 
university, are more concerned with getting through their exams right 
now.

Winnings: Mrs Jones said she still does not know where the ticket went, but assumes it's in the trash

'It's been a great story,' her husband Richard, who is also an engineer, added to reporters. 'Who would have thought? It's only been the last few days we've known for sure.'

Still now, Mrs Jones has no idea what became of the winning ticket.

'I wish I knew,' she said. 'I honestly don't know. I have looked into my house very thoroughly and it's not there. I'm not sure whether I threw it out by accident or what happened to it.'
