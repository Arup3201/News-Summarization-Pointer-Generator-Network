Every state has films associated with it whether it be Casino in Nevada or The Godfather in New York and now a clever Redditor has assembled a map of every state's (and the District of Columbia's) favorite native movies.

By isolating movies set largely in each state then finding the most popular among them on IMDB, Reddit user Jakubisko has created a visual representation of favorite flicks from sea to shining sea.

The fascinating endeavor left many states branded with a feel good classic (Indiana got A Christmas Story!), but others weren't as lucky (sorry South Carolina, you get Full Metal Jacket).

Some states also wound up matched with some unexpected films.

While Washington, DC's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is no surprise, the most popular film set in the state of Washington is the 2011 Joseph Gordon-Levitt film 50/50.

Some of the states' films were obvious. The gambling state of Nevada ended up with 1995 Casino while Mississippi's most popular native flick is Django Unchained

Contention: Some films seemed obvious but made for contentious additions to the map. Fargo, for instance, is listed as North Dakota's favorite movie, but commenters pointed out that only a small portion of the film takes place in the state

Other films ended up with unsavory, though classic, films representing them like maryland (Silence of the Lambs) and Kansas (In Cold Blood)
