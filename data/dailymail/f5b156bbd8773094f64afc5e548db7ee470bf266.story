Goalkeeper Ben Foster has left England's training camp to return to his club West Brom after sustaining a thumb injury.

The 31-year-old sustained the knock on Tuesday and was sent back to the Baggies as a precaution ahead of the friendly at home to Norway on Wednesday.

'England goalkeeper Ben Foster picked up a knock in training on Tuesday and has returned to his club for treatment as a precautionary measure,' said a statement from the FA.

'West Bromwich Albion will provide further guidance on Ben Foster.

'At this time, England manager Roy Hodgson will not call up any replacements.'

West Brom said their medical team were assessing the problem.

'We will spend the next few days letting it settle down and then assess it again - but at this stage we are optimistic it is not a serious problem,' director of football administration Richard Garlick told wba.co.uk.

'It made sense for Ben to take no chances.'

Manchester City's Joe Hart is Hodgson's first choice and will start against Norway, and in Monday's opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland, with Southampton's new signing Fraser Forster his deputy for tonight.
