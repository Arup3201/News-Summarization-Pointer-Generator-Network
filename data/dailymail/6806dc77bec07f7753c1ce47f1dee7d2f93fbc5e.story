Every season has one, a big trend or  specific piece of clothing that sends shoppers into a buying frenzy and garments flying off shelves in seconds.

There was the pink coat craze of Autumn 2013, the blanket scarf trend of the winter just passed and who can forget the crop top and high-waisted skirt look worn day-in-day-out by celebrities including Kim Kardashian last summer?

This season however, Marks & Spencer style director Belinda Earl believes it's her turn, and she might just be right.

Marks and Spencer is hoping to raise its fashion game with the new Spring/Summer 2015 clothing collection, namely this limited edition real suede skirt, £199, inspired by the seventies trend fashion revival

Meet the suede skirt M&S is pinning all its hopes on for a much-needed fashion revival.

Due in stores next month, the £199 skirt has already been given the celebrity seal of approval.

In February, both British model Alexa Chung and New York style icon Olivia Palermo wore the skirt within days of each other, the latter at New York Fashion Week no less.

After first debuting their hero design at the Spring/Summer 2015 collection preview for the industry's key fashion editors, there's been a buzz surrounding the Seventies-inspired item.

British model and It girl Alexa Chung wore the M&S suede skirt to a celebrity-studded launch party in London. Known for her mix of chic and edgy style, Alexa has sparked more than a few fashion trends in her time

New York socialite and fashion blogger Olivia Palermo, who shot to fame on US reality show The City as an apprentice at fashion house Diane von Furstenberg, debuted the M&S suede skirt at New York Fashion Week

Now M&S is hoping the fashion-led fancies of high street shoppers are taken by the skirt in exactly the same way.

The brand has even brought the sale date forward by a month from May to April in anticipation of the frenzy, and seen to it that five times the original order of suede skirts are made.

Of her fourth collection for the high street giant, and complete revamp of the brand's failing fashion offering, style director Belinda Earl told British Vogue: 'Everything is coming together.

Designed to be both on trend and practical, the soon to be famous Marks and Spencer suede skirt will launch in stores and online 10 April, a month earlier than originally planned to meet high shopper demand

'The quality, the new styles, the ad campaigns - it's all filtering through. It was never going to be a one-season turnaround.'

A cheaper faux suede version of the skirt, priced at £39.50 has already sold out online, raising expectations for the hero number even higher.

Inspired by the Seventies trend popular on the Spring/Summer 2015 Fashion Week catwalks, the skirt has also been influenced by M&S archive designs.

Seventies icons Ali MacGraw and Jane Birkin are also a key influence on this season's M&S collection, with wearable style and practical glamour running through its core.

The seventies fashion trend is set to be a big look for spring and summer, with designers including Gucci (pictured), Mulberry, Alice Temperley and more showing off plenty of brown suede at fashion week SS15
