Brides on a budget are flocking to a local charity shop after a mystery donor gave them £60,000 worth of new wedding dresses.

Staff at the PDSA store in Bournemouth, Dorset, were shocked when they opened several cardboard boxes left for them to find 100 pristine wedding and bridesmaid gowns inside.

The garments have a combined retail price of almost £60,000, but the charity shop is selling them for hugely discounted prices.

The average original retail price of a dress is £600, but one spectacular gown worth £1,500 is up for sale for £250.

And since the dresses went on sale the shop in Boscombe has been swamped by young women.

The small store has just one fitting room but staff had converted a stock room at the back to make a second.

They have also brought in extra mirrors for the brides-to-be.

The generous donor has not been identified but they are believed to be in the trade. Some of the frocks are ex-display and some are just excess stock.

Annie Campbell, an area manager for the PDSA, said the charity stands to raise over £10,000 from the bridal gown bonanza.

Amelia Platt from Charminster came to the shop to look through the wedding dresses

She said: 'I knew we were going to get some wedding dresses but had no idea how many and of what quality.

'But they are all new and many still have their tags on.

'There are dresses in varying sizes and styles, from meringue layers to something quite sleek. But they are all modern designs.

'Many of the wedding gowns have recommended retail prices of 500 pounds and upwards.

'We are selling the bridesmaid dresses for about £60 to £70 and the wedding dressed for between £150 to £250.

'We considered sharing the dresses out around our other stores but thought if brides-to-be are coming to try on dresses they will want as much choice as possible.

'We have had a fantastic response from the public. The phone hasn't stopped ringing with people asking how many dresses we have left and asking where we are.

'Our staff aren't experts but they are being honest in their opinion of whether a particular dress suits a person or fits right.

'We are trying to make it a nice wedding-dress-shopping experience for these customers but unfortunately we can't stretch to offering them free Champagne.'
