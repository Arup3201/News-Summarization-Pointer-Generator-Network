A quick-thinking diving instructor used plastic sandals as a makeshift splint after a woman drove a quad bike off a 60ft cliff and shattered her leg.

Melanie Simmonds, 31, from Farnborough, Hampshire, was on a cheap holiday with her boyfriend Jay Buckley in Kefalonia, Greece, when they decided to hire the vehicle instead of taking a taxi.

But the former care worker said that while she was in the driving seat the wheels locked and she was unable to steer, leaving them hurtling down the cliff, stopping short of the water's edge.

She frantically rung the last number in her phone which went through to the driving school and one of the instructors - Peter Tovey - was able to rush to their side.

Miss Simmonds said: 'I'd been wearing cropped jeans and underneath my bones jutted through bloodied flesh on my left knee, right shin and ankle.

'The diving instructor was with us in minutes using his flip flops as splints on my shattered bones. 

'When the ambulance arrived I was put on a stretcher and winched slowly up the cliff face. It took 30 minutes and felt like I was screaming forever.'

Plaster casts were put on her legs in a Greek hospital soon after she crashed off a 60ft cliff on the quad bike

Miss Simmonds had suffered multiple breaks in both legs, a broken finger and fractured nose in the accident, which happened in June 2010.

Mr Buckley, who she has since split from, sustained only minor injuries. 

The crash was not deemed anyone's fault but the couple were not covered for quad biking in their insurance. 

She explained: 'Taxis were so expensive so I suggested we hire a quad bike to get back. They were so cheap to hire for the day.

'We'd seen other people do it and they looked fine. We both strapped on our helmets. I was in the driving seat with Jay holding on to my hips.

'I was enjoying the scenery of the stunning coastal road with a steep drop down with sheer cliffs on one side.

The diving instructor took off his flip-flops and made a makeshift splint to support her leg until emergency services could arrive and airlift her to hospital

'But as we drove along, I spotted a sharp corner up ahead. I turned the handlebars into it. But as I tried to turn out again, the wheels seemed to lock.

'I was helpless as we plummeted off the cliff. If I hadn't been wearing my big camera bag on my back I think I would have been paralysed or worse, as it protected my back.

'The next thing I knew I was lying at the bottom of the cliff on the shore, with the bike in the sea and water lapping at my arm - if I'd landed a yard away I would have drowned.'

She was told that Greek doctors could only do the minimum to help and they pulled her bones back together and gave her painkillers. 

After 10 days she was allowed to leave but needed to remain stretchered.

Miss Simmonds said: 'Getting back to the UK was a nightmare. I had to spend 16 hours in an ambulance and we reserved nine seats on the plane back.'

The return trip took two days and cost £8,000, which was 26 times more than the £300 trip initially cost them.

Her nose was split in two in the incident and she underwent a number of operations to fix it. Pictured after her second surgery

A doctor told her she will never regain full strength in her legs again. Pictured right, Miss Simmonds getting ready to dive while on the holiday that left her in hospital

She had to have a metal rod through the whole bone in a second operation, which left her right leg bruised

After landing at Heathrow airport, Miss Simmonds was taken to Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey.

She said: 'Family rushed to see me and I'd never been more pleased to see them. Doctors found I had multiple breaks in both legs, a broken finger and a broken nose.

'I needed a metal rod in my right leg, a plate in my left knee and another in my nose. The doctors there were absolutely brilliant.

'I was just so grateful. I've never appreciated the NHS so much.'

After 11 days in hospital, she was allowed home but still needed seven operations.

'I was in a wheelchair for six long months. Doctors said I'd never regain full strength in my legs. I could walk but not run long distances.

'People told me I was lucky to be alive, but it didn't feel like it. I left my job and spent my days at home feeling low.'

A year after the accident, Miss Simmonds started working with The Halow Project, a local charity for young, disabled people and now has a new partner Craig Ifaia, 31.

Miss Simmonds said: 'Looking back, I wouldn't change what happened. I believe everything happens for a reason. Without it, I wouldn't be who I am today.

'I wouldn't have a job I love, or be confident that I can take on anything. It's been a long road, but I refuse to let that holiday disaster shatter my dreams.'
