When she was at the helm of Jimmy Choo, Tamara Mellon proved she knew exactly what women wanted and her creations became a hit with 
A-listers, including Victoria Beckham and Princess Diana.

After leaving the luxury label that she founded and managed between 1996 and 2011 - she sold her shares for £82.5 million - Ms Mellon has unveiled her very own collection of totes, ready-to-wear and, of course, shoes.

As she launches her e-commerce site, Tamara has called on supermodel Karlie Kloss to showcase her new designs.

It's cowgirl Karlie! Miss Kloss is Tamara Mellon's new poster girl and shows off her svelte physique in the new campaign imagery

The 21-year-old Victoria's Secret model takes on the role of cowboy Karlie, modelling the brand's signature fringing and leather goods to perfection.

In one shot, the American model poses with just ropes and a cowboy hat concealing her modesty and in another, she wears a revealing lace skirt.

Yee-ha! Karlie plays a sexy cowgirl in the new campaign imagery as she showcases the best of Mellon's leather offerings

Toned: Karlie, who showcases her enviable physique in the photoshoot, says when she is traveling, she brings 'two or three-pound ankle weights and resistance bands' with her, so she can work out in her hotel room

Want to get Karlie's look? The 
supermodel, who admitted that she has so many beauty products, a 
bathroom isn't enough to contain them, has shared the secrets behind her
 glow.

The young star, who 
appears in the July issue of ELLE, revealed: 'I have a whole second 
bedroom filled with products, but I stick to the things that work.'

She adds: 'I like products that streamline my morning routine. Sunday Riley has a really good foundation; it’s very velvety. I love RMS “Un” Cover-Up for under eyes or on a blemish.'

She also credits Living Proof shampoo and conditioner, for making her hair 'bounce in a different way,' and mentions that Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer is also 'good.'

And as for her body, the statuesque six-foot-one model told the fashion magazine that when she is travelling, she brings 'two or three-pound ankle weights and resistance bands' along with her, and favors the privacy of her hotel room over the gym.

'Sometimes I get a better workout staying in my room and forcing myself to do half an hour or even 15 minutes versus going to the gym, she says. 'Before I leave for work, I try to do something. It helps me feel better for the rest of the day.' 

Miss Kloss also mentions her Nike Training Club app - which features workouts for women - as helpful in keeping her active.

Debut shoe: Tamara Mellon, who left Jimmy Choo in 2011, has unveiled her £1,595 leather legging boots - appropriately named Sweet Revenge

Mellon's new collection has been causing quite the stir, particularly her £1,595 leather legging boots, which have been worn by Kim Kardashian.The range also includes a £725 leather tote, £550 stretch-wool piqué straight-leg pants and £830 fringed wrap-effect leather skirt.

And her designs are winning over the fashion world: she's set to open her online shop in Britain and she's planning on opening outlets in London and New York next year before expanding into Europe and the Middle East - Cheryl Cole even wore a pair of her snakeskin metallic blue sandals at the X Factor auditions in Manchester.

Today, armed with a wealth of business experience, she has finally unveiled her own namesake label - and Tamara says she’s the happiest she has ever been, and credits much of it to her daughter Araminta, 12.

Despite
 not even reaching her teenage years yet, Araminta - known more fondly as 'Minty' - is wasting no time 
learning the ropes so that she can one day follow in her mother’s own 
fabulous footsteps.

Of course she's wearing them! Kim Kardashian, who has a penchant for leather, has been spotted wearing the quirky design

‘She travels everywhere with me and sits in on all my meetings,’ Mellon tells MailOnline.

‘She’s learning about what I do from osmosis, from actually doing it. And I think that’s the best education. It’s giving her confidence and experience. She’s very smart. If she has an idea, she contributes.’

She continues: ‘My daughter and I bond over the business and decided, together, she’s going to travel with me and be in on my meetings.

‘It’s such a great way for us to bond. I love having her with me, I hate leaving her behind.’

Whether Minty will take over the reigns from her mother one day is still to be decided, however. ‘It’s a little early still,’ laughs Mellon. ‘But she loves fashion. She’s got strong opinions, which I like.

'It’s very good, though I don’t get a say in what she wears. Unless she asks for my advice, I stay out of it!

‘If there was a stage that she was wearing really inappropriate clothing then I would put my foot down, thankfully we haven’t hit that bridge yet!’
