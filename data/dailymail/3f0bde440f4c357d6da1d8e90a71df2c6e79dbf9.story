A car fanatic was reduced to tears when his beloved Mercedes supercar was 'totally wrecked' after technicians fixing a minor fault crashed during a test drive.

John Guest left his unique Mercedes Benz SL65 AMG - which costs £170,000 to buy new - with technicians at a Mercedes dealer near his home in Poole, Dorset, to fix problems with its onboard computer.

Just hours after he had dropped his pride and joy off at Sandown Mercedes he received a call to say the flash motor had crashed on a nearby dual carriageway.

John Guest was shocked to recieve a call from the garage hours later to say his Mercedes Benz SL65 AMG had been involved in a smash on a nearby dual carriageway

The dealership claims the car, which 
boasts a six-litre engine and a top speed of 180mph, was being driven 
'legally and sensibly' when it spun off the road in bad weather.

Mr Guest, 56, bought the car in 2010 and has since spent £30,000 on maintaining it. He said he is now considering legal action against the dealership.

The semi-retired IT consultant, said: 'When I took the car in I 
told them there was also a problem with the traction control system but I
 was assured nothing was wrong.

'Later that day I got the phone call from the garage to say my car had been involved in a crash.

'My first concern was for the safety of the driver who thankfully wasn't hurt.

'The dealership tried to take it directly to a bodyshop but I demanded to see it.

'I
 thought the car might have been involved in a minor crash but I 
couldn't believe it when I saw it - it was totally written off and will 
have to be scrapped.

'There was a tear in my eye because I have so many fond memories of the car. It was a car for life and it's irreplaceable.

'The thing that angers me most is the suggestion the car was being sensibly driven.

'Thousands of cars drove down that road that day, only three crashed and mine was the only one to be totally wrecked.

Mr Guest's Mercedes was the sought after SL65 AMG.

Gearbox: seven-speed automatic

'It's negligence on the dealership's part.

'It
 is very galling given that I haven't done anything wrong. My only 
mistake was leaving my car with the dealership in the first place.'

The flash motor was one of only 90 in the country and is the only one with a £25,000 pearlescent paint job.

Mr Guest was given a courtesy car, a 
Mercedes Benz E350, by the garage and is now pursuing a settlement 
through his insurance company.

He added: 'The bottom line is that I have lost something that is irreplaceable. My car was unique and I don't think I am being unreasonable to ask for a replacement.'

Gavin
 McAllister, managing director of the Sandown Group of Mercedes 
dealerships, said: 'I was distressed to learn of the incident with Mr 
Guest's car, and I'm relieved that no one else was involved in this 
unfortunate accident.

'As
 soon as it happened, we co-operated fully with the authorities, and the
 police have confirmed that the car was being driven legally and 
sensibly in the road conditions.

'This
 is cold comfort for Mr Guest of course, who is a loyal and valued 
customer, and I along with everyone in my team at Sandown are committed 
to doing the right thing by him.

'We're working closely with the insurance team and are keeping Mr Guest fully informed throughout.

'Of course, we've provided a new courtesy car to keep him mobile in the meantime.

'Thankfully, incidents like this are very rare, and our technician is making a good recovery.'
