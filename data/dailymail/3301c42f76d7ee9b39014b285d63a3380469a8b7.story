After child pornography scandals, explicit gore, and a celebrity nude photo leak the creator of 4chan finally decided to step down as the site's administrator.

Chris Poole who goes by 'moot' founded the anonymous social site 11 years ago when he was just 15-years-old and announced his difficult decision to quit on Wednesday.

Poole published his resignation on the site at 11:00 am that began, 'I founded 4chan eleven and a half years ago at the age of 15, and after more than a decade of service, I've decided it's time for me to move on.'

His goodbye states that he's worked over the years to satisfy the millions of webpage visitors and also maintain the finances and resources to keep the site running and that he's succeeded.

Anonymous sharing: The biggest difference between 4chan and other forums is that it allows commenters and contributors to post anonymously

'As 4chan's sole administrator, decision maker, and keeper of most of its institutional knowledge, I've come to represent an uncomfortably large single point of failure,' wrote Poole who has decided to pass off his duties to a group of volunteers despite still 'calling the shots.'

I'll need time away to decompress and reflect, but I look forward to one day returning to 4chan as its Admin Emeritus or just another Anonymous, and also writing more about my experience running 4chan on my personal blog,' writes Poole who says he may return someday.

Poole said that from a user's perspective nothing should change and that his team of experts will help him make the transition as he steps down as administrator.

This Friday afternoon Poole plans on hosting a live question and answer session on the site and says he'll be reading all his emails at moot@4chan.org should anyone have any additional queries.

4chan is an anonymous photo sharing site along with a comment board whose greatest strength of anonymity has also become a problem area.

Long leadership:  4chan was originally meant to be a forum to discuss Japanese anime and post photos. The image board site soon grew to by much more, and quickly became one of the biggest websites in the world

Leaked: Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were posted to 4chan which then circulated the web

An anonymous individual sparked some scandal this past August after dumping dozens of naked photographs of female celebrities onto the 4chan online forum.

Hundreds of leaked photos of celebrities followed. 

Among those celebrities whose photos were shared were Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Kristen Dunst and Kaley Cuoco, to name a few.

Photos of Olympic Gymnast McKayla Maroney were also included on the site and it was later discovered that photos of Maroney were taken while she was underage and therefore qualified as child pornography.

A Murderous confession along with photos of a corpse were also shared on the anonymous board.

In November, David Kalac was accused of brutally murdering Amber Lynn Coplin in her home in Port Orchard, Washington, before going on the run and leaving her 13-year-old son to discover the body when he came home from school.

Child pornography: Photos of Gold medalist USA's Mc Kayla Maroney were also posted on the site but they  were taken when she was underage and were therefore child pornography

Kalac is said to have posted pictured of Colin's naked body on a bed with red marks around her neck on 4chan.

'Check the news for Port Orchard Washington in a few hours,' said a 4chan message, viewed by Dailymail.com

'Her son will be home from school soon. He'll find her, then call the cops.

'I just wanted to share the pics before they find me. I bought a BB gun that looks realistic enough. When they come, I'll pull it and it will be suicide by cop.

'I understand the doubts. Just check the f***ing news. I have to lose my phone now, ‘said the chilling post.

In addition to posting leaked nude images and gruesome murders, 4chan has also been a place for popular memes, celebrity rumors to swirl, and harsh cyber-bullying among other topics.

Created in 2003 by a 15-year-old high school student from New York City, Christopher Poole, 4chan was originally meant to be a forum to discuss Japanese anime and post photos. The image board site soon grew to by much more, and quickly became one of the biggest websites in the world.

The biggest difference between 4chan and other websites however is that it allows commenters and contributors to post anonymously, giving many free reign to do things they would not do otherwise.

While this has led to the site producing some amusing and funny pranks, many are horrific and have led to the arrest of the person or persons who created them.

LOLCats – The Internet obsession with cats actually began back in 2005 when one 4Chan commenter decided to post as a photo of a cat waiting for Caturday. It all took off from there.

Rickroll – In 2007, a fake link to the trailer for the video game Grand Theft Auto IV was posted to the site after the website of the game’s publisher, Rockstar Games, crashed. Instead of seeing a look at the highly anticipated new game, eager fans were instead taken to the YouTube page for the Rick Astley music video “Never Gonna Give You Up.”

Steve Jobs Death – In 2008 members on the site spread a false rumor that Steve Jobs was dead, causing Apple stock prices to plummet a whopping 10% in one day.

Send Justin Bieber To North Korea – Justin Bieber has long been a target for the site, and in 2010 he wanted fans to tell him where they wanted him to go on his My World Tour. 4Chan users hacked his site, and the overwhelming winner was North Korea. The Canadian did not ultimately make the trip.

Jessi Slaughter – In what may have been their most vicious attack to date, members of 4Chan began to cyberbully an 11-year-old girl after claiming she was having a relationship with an older man. They posted her address, called her house, and spread false rumors and reports about her and her family. The threats got so bad that the young girl was put in police protection at one point.

Trayvon Martin – In 2012 a 4Chan hacker and white supremacist falsely claimed they had hacked into Trayvon Martin’s email and Facebook accounts after his murder, posting emails and photos that were supposed to back up the false claim that Martin was a drug addict and dealer.

Cutting For Bieber – In early 2013, a member of 4Chan created an elaborate Twitter hoax in which they urged fans of Justin Bieber to cut themselves so the pop star would stop smoking weed. Soon, the hashtags #cutforbieber and #cuttingforbieber amassed numerous photos of fans who claimed to have slashed their wrists and forearms over Bieber's drug use.

Taylor Swift's Biggest Fan – In 2013 Taylor Swift, like Bieber, wanted fans to help her out with her next contest. She was looking for her biggest fan, and 4Chan made sure the winner was a 39-year-old man named Charles who wanted to ‘sniff Taylor’s hair.’ The contest was ultimately cancelled.

Celebrity Nude Leaks – Nothing 4Chan has done has had a bigger impact however than the leaking of hundreds of nude photos of celebrities in 2014, something that eventually led to the FBI getting involved. Victims included A-list stars like Jennifer Lawrence, Gabrielle Union, Kim Kardashian and Rihanna.
