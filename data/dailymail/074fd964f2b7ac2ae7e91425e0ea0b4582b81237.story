A shopper was shocked when he weighed a £1 bag of Asda bananas on a self-scan checkout - and found they only cost 54p.

Alan Hudson, 52, was shopping at his local Asda supermarket in Boldon, Tyne and Wear, when he decided to see how much his £1 bag of bananas would cost if they were loose.

Since posting the video on Facebook last week, the clip has attracted an astonishing two million views and been shared more than 30,000 times.

Alan Hudson, 52, was shocked when he weighed a £1 bag of Asda bananas and found they only cost 54p

Mr Hudson, a train driver, said: 'It's disgusting really.

'There are millions of people living on the poverty line, trying to reduce the cost of their shopping as much as possible and looking out for bargains.

'That bag had a bright red sticker on it, saying they were a pound.

'It makes it look like a bargain, when in fact you're getting ripped off by nearly half.

'I'm definitely going to be reconsidering my shopping habits, and I hope others do too.

'I do like bananas, but I'm going to think twice about where I buy them from.'

The MySupermarket website shows that vegetables and fruit bought from Asda tends to be cheaper when bought individually rather than in a packet. 

Pink lady apples x 4 - £2 (50p each)

Pink lady apple single - 47.5p

Bag of oranges x 5 - £2 (40p each)

Orange loose - 25p 

Kiwi fruit x4 - £1.65 (41.3p each)

Kiwi fruit loose - 24p 

Lemons x 5 - £1.50 (30p each)

Lemon loose - 25p 

Red onions x 4 - £1 (25p each)

Red onion loose - 9.8p 

On Asda's website, the £1 bag of five bananas are advertised as costing only 20p each, while loose bananas, under their 'Pricelock' guarantee, are set at 68p per kilo.  

If somebody were to take a banana to work every day for a year, buying the bags of them would cost £52 annually, while buying five loose fruits a week would come to around £28, depending on their weight.

Elsewhere, other pre-bagged fruit and vegetables, such as potatoes, apples, tomatoes and pears, were either always cheaper or the same price. 

An Asda in Filton, Bristol, saw a £1 bag of onions weigh in at 69p.

However, it was a Tesco in Eastville, in Bristol which saw the biggest price difference, with a £1 bag of onions weighing in at just 30p and a £1 bag of bananas weighing 59p.

But today Asda defended its pre-packaged bananas, justifying the extra cost because they are 'perfect to eat'.

A spokesman for the supermarket chain said: 'The majority of bananas we sell are loose which require a little bit of ripening at home and are price locked at 68p per kilo.

'Our pre-packed bananas are stored for a little longer and have already been ripened so they're perfect to eat as soon as you've bought them, they are then pre packed by hand, which is why they're slightly more expensive.

'We clearly label the prices in store, so customers can choose which product is best for them.' 

Joanna Blythman, author of Shopped: the shocking power of British supermarkets, told MailOnline: 'I am not the least bit surprised by this news. This sort of thing happens all the time. 

'Supermarkets are very good at creating an illusion that they give people good value for food, but they give with one hand and take with the other. 

'They give you the idea that you are getting a bargain when often it is the opposite. But we trust them not to lie to us.

'They use price and promotion to confuse consumers and you only tend to notice if you are vigilant.'

She added: 'You should never believe any supermarket promotion. If you think you are getting a good deal, you should act with suspicion and cynicism.' 

Charlotte Burns, who writes the MoneySavingExpert’s Deals Hunter blog, told MailOnline: ‘Supermarkets often have deals on their pre-packaged fruit and veg to lure shoppers into thinking they’re getting a great price. 

'But what many people don’t know is that buying pre-packaged fruit and veg can cost you nearly twice as much as buying the same fruit and veg individually.

'I recently tested this at Morrisons. It sells £1 bags, with five bananas in each bag. I weighed up a bag to see how much the bananas would have cost if I had bought five individually – it was 55p.'

'When you can, try to buy loose items or products from behind the counter. But keep an eye out for discounts on pre-packed alternatives.'
