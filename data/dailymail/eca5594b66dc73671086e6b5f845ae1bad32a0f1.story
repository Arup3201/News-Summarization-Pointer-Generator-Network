Motorways are have to have their hard-shoulders opened up in a string of plans aimed at reducing congestion, it emerged today.

Radical proposals for 19 separate schemes on Britain's motorways are currently under consideration. Twelve of these will include widening the roads to four lanes.

The plans could see parts of the M60 near Manchester, the M1 near Wakefield and the M25 around London switched to 'managed motorways'. While the A14 from Rugby to Felixstowe would be hived off to private firms to convert to a toll road.

Congestion: Traffic moves along the M1 close to junction 10, where part of the motorway could be widened by opening up the hard shoulder

But the plans would mean constant monitoring of the roads through a network of CCTV cameras and desk-workers.

Road controllers would be employed to communicate with drivers through digital road signs. Lanes would also be opened and closed depending on the amount of traffic.

Hundreds of new speed cameras would be rolled out, in addition to magnetic devices that measure the amount of cars and their speeds. The idea is that sudden changes in traffic flow would be recognised and lanes could be closed or reopened.

The extra lanes have also been outlined for the M1 between junction 10 and 13 in Bedfordshire, junction 28 and 31 in Derbyshire, junction 32 to 35a in Sheffield and Junction 39 to 42 in Wakefield.

The M4 in Bristol could see the hard shoulder used between junction 19 and 20 while the M5 could be opened up between 15 and 17.

Plans: Transport Secretary Phillip Hammond is considering road changes

In Birmingham, the M6 between junctions 5 and 8 would be widened while the M25 will see changes between  junctions 5 and 7 in Surrey and junctions 23 and 27 in Hertfordshire.

Changes to the M60 in Manchester would be between junction 8 and 15 while the M62 would be widened between 18 and 20 and 25 and 30 in West Yorkshire.

Proposals for changes to roads will be published by the national network this Autumn.  The statement will include measures that officials hope will bulldoze road and rail schemes through the planning system faster.

Civil servants at the Department for Transport prefer the schemes over more expensive widening work or building new roads.

But residents and environmental campaigners have reacted angrily to the plans. They claim that road congestion will increase.

Stephen Joseph from the Campaign for Better Transport told the Sunday Times: 'Spending billions of expanding motorways simply shifts traffic jams to the bottleneck, generates extra traffic and causes environmental damage.

'The A14 toll road idea is especially barmy because the cost will push people onto country roads lanes. The M6 toll road has shown that such roads lose money.'

The plans under consideration by Transport Secretary Phillip Hammond come after a trial on the M42 east of Birmingham where the hard shoulder was used.

Traffic was managed and officials claim that accidents were reduced while the flow of vehicles improved.

Jack Semple from the Road Haulage Association said: 'We have had a decade of a war on motorists but the more congested our roads becomes, the more it slows our economy.'
