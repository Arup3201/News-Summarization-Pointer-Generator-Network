It's been a whirlwind year for White Dee who shot to stardom after sharing her financial woes on the Channel 4 documentary series Benefits Street. 

And following a string of celebrity appearances and television interviews, it seems the 42-year-old is sharing the good fortune afforded to her sudden celebrity.

Dee, whose real name is Deidre Kelly, was seen splurging on some last-minute Christmas gifts in her native Birmingham today.

Laden down with expensive goods such as a WiiFit, the mother-of-two sported a Santa hat for the occasion and was seen chatting with local shopkeepers.

It comes after the star accused producers of the controversial Channel 4 documentary series of lying to participants before it was aired. 

Describing the situation as 'a catch-22', Dee told her local newspaper, the Birmingham Mail: 'I am still adamant I can never forgive the makers of Benefits Street, but it is a Catch 22 situation.

'If it wasn't for that I would not be able to do so many things for my kids.'

Dee was the standout star of the controversial programme which many described as 'poverty porn' when it was first shown earlier this year.

Dee (real name Deidre Kelly) said she could never forgive Channel 4 producers for 'lying' to the participants of Benefits Street 

The mother-of-two said she was glad the series provided her with opportunities for financial freedom

Among critics of of the show were participants themselves, who claimed Channel 4 producers told them they would be taking part in a programme about community spirit.

Following her appearance on the documentary series, White Dee was invited to host club nights and parties across the UK and in Magaluf. 

She was then invited to take part in Celebrity Big Brother, before signing up to be one of the judges on a new talent-scouting programme yet to be broadcast. 

Speaking of her change in lifestyle, Dee, who previously claimed handouts for depression, said: ' It's my job now and I am determined to make sure my children get a better start in life but I find it weird watching myself on television.'

Dee is also to be made the star of a documentary based solely on her and her transformation from a benefits claimant to financial freedom.
