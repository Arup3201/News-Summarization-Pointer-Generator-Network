For the adult who's never outgrown a childhood love of Lego, this could be the home of their dreams.

Because while Stratheden, which is for sale in north London's exclusive Bishops Avenue is undoubtedly sophisticated, it also bears more than a passing resemblance to the plastic construction bricks we all remember from our youth.

Inside, however, the £34m house offers the ultimate in grown-up luxury, with wall-to-wall mirrors, steam-room, and a ballroom with polished floor the size of a normal house.

No expense has been spared in the refurbishment of this 1930s Cape Dutch-style home on the Bishops Avenue - you just need £34m (and then some) to afford it

Built in Cape Dutch style in 1925, it is one of the largest houses on a street that boasts some of the UK's most impressive - and expensive - properties.

The Bishops Avenue, also known as Billionaires' Row, is home to oil barons, oligarchs and royalty from Russia,the Middle East and Africa.

Knight Frank and Glentree International, the agents who are selling the vast home, are sure the house's features and high-end specification will ensure finding a buyer for Stratheden will be no trouble.

The ambassadorial style house boasts nine bedrooms, eight bathrooms, five reception rooms and - despite being located only a short drive from the centre of London - almost one acre of land.

One of the stand-out features of the mansion, which was recently rebuilt and has a look of (albeit very expensive) Lego about its exterior, is the ballroom which takes up a staggering 2,700sq/ft - making it perfect for entertaining guests.

The room, which could also double up as an art gallery, has the same floor-space as an average family home.

The mirrored ballroom has roughly the floorspace of a family's average-sized house - but the buyer of Stratheden probably won't have to vacuum it themselves

With polished marble floor, contemporary artwork and dramatic staircase, guests at the newly-refurbished house will enjoy making quite an entrance

No expense spared: Stratheden has nine bedrooms, eight bathrooms, and an impressive - particularly for London - one-acre garden

You would need to have put in some hard work in Stratheden's gym before you could feel totally confident having a bath in this hall of mirrors

Stratheden, which will attract a stamp duty bill of £2.4m if it sells for the asking price, also has a 12-metre indoor swimming pool with separate gym, steam and sauna rooms, and a massage/hairdressing/spa room.

There is also a champagne bar, complete with glitzy silver seating and mirrored bar, where the new owner will be able to toast his or her purchase.

Trevor Abrahmsohn, director of Glentree, has sold £3 billion worth of properties on The Bishops Avenue over the past 35 years.

He said: 'Stratheden has Cape Dutch architecture and this is unique in the area.  That is why the local authority has listed the building and, as such, preserved its architectural heritage.

The dirty plasters and stray hairs of public swimming pools will not trouble the new owner of Stratheden - it boasts its own indoor 12-metre pool, plus separate gym

Stratheden has a jacuzzi and relaxation area beside the pool, which enjoys natural light and French windows onto the one-acre garden

For those wanting to unwind after a hard session in the gym or pool, the mansion has a marble and polished-wood floored champagne bar, complete with silver banquette seating and mirrored bar

There is a subterranean cinema with luxurious burgundy velvet walls where the buyer will be able to relax and forget about their mortgage repayments for a while

This dramatic bathroom is one of eight in the mansion, although if the lady of the house does not feel like washing her own hair, she could pop into the hairdressing salon

'The pool and leisure area is absolutely stunning and what can one say when you have your own bespoke art gallery/ballroom area and champagne bar, how decadent.

'This is a home for the family that has everything except a home of this quality. You just have to bring your food and clothes and you are ready to rock and roll.'

The property is spread over four floors with the leisure complex which includes a cinema based on the subterranean level.

Outside, there is a huge drive at the front while the rear boasts an Italian sunken garden, raised garden, water features and a two-bedroom cottage for staff.

Stratheden has one acre of garden, which has been landscaped to provide a relatively easy-to maintain space complete with box hedges and small trees

This high-spec kitchen may not be the house's strong spot (and looks like it'd be tricky to keep clean) but the buyer of the house probably won't use it themselves

This pretty bedroom has expensive carpet, sloped ceiling and an attractive round window dating back to the house's origins in the Arts and Crafts period

Stratheden's garden is impressively large for a house so near central London, and water features, pergolas, and a grass lawn that would be perfect for croquet

The Bishops Road is already home to oligarchs, royalty and oil barons, but Stratheden is still one of the biggest houses on the street

The dining table comfortably seats 14 and boasts polished wood parquet flooring, handpainted panels, and a high-spec lighting system

Parquet floors, polished marble and mirrored walls are features of the vast mansion in The Bishops Avenue

The nine-bedroom house looks dramatic at night with its state of the art lighting system and landscaped garden

With corridors lined with gleaming marble and abstract art, the £34m house looks more like an expensive hotel than a home at the moment

To afford a house like this you probably have a business or two - Stratheden comes with a smart office where the new owner will be able to work in peace

The £34m house boasts a stunning, aquamarine tiled steam room where the residents and their guests can sweat away their worries in some style

This kitchen is rather more attractive than the other one, and boasts natural light as well, so perhaps the family of the house might find themselves tempted to cook the odd thing in here - in one of the four ovens...

You wouldn't want to have a 'fat day' in here, no matter how rich you are - the heavily-mirrored dressing room would be a nightmare if you weren't feeling confident about how you looked

The in-house hairdressing salon has more mirrors, plus leather-padded walls, as well as a bed for massage treatments

This spare room has a built-in flat-screen TV and plenty of room for guests at Stratheden in north London to sprawl out in the super king-size bed

Whoever designed the house for its recent refurbishment was fond of geometrically-framed vistas: The marble staircase and the garden's pergolas are both stunning

Natural light pours in through the cupola, highlighting the expensively polished wooden floor - and acres of space (plus more mirrors)

An in-house sauna is de rigueur for the mega-rich these days, so Stratheden is fitted with a large one as standard

This ensuite bathroom offers views onto the garden, a large bath with marble surround, and modern sink and high-pressure shower

Luxury fittings in the house include smart polished wood wardrobes, left, and a breath-taking shower lined with astonishingly beautiful polished stone, right
