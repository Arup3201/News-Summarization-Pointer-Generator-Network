At least four major 
wildfires fueled by hot, gusty weather burned along the front of the 
Rocky Mountains in Colorado on Tuesday, destroying a handful of large 
houses and chasing people from hundreds of homes.

Thick
smoke plumes visible for miles billowed from fires near Colorado 
Springs, in southern Colorado, and in Rocky Mountain National Park to 
the north.

A wildfire in a heavily wooded 
residential area northeast of Colorado Springs led to the mandatory 
evacuations of more than 2,000 homes, including some worth more than $1 
million, El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa said.

eight homes had burned, Maketa said, but he had no exact number because 
the fire was moving so quickly across the parched forest.

"Right
now the firefighters are more focused on fighting fires, drawing lines.
And law enforcement, to be very honest, is scrambling to get people out
of there as well as do searches," Maketa said. He said firefighters 
have shifted from evacuation mode to search-and-rescue mode.

Military
officials said a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter from the Colorado Army 
National Guard and three helicopters from Fort Carson were helping 
firefighters. Another National Guard helicopter was on standby for 
search and rescue.

The area is not far from last summer's devastating Waldo Canyon Fire that destroyed 346 homes and killed two.

"It's very, very reminiscent of what we experienced in Waldo Canyon," Maketa said.

All of the wildfires were moving quickly, driven by record temperatures and strong winds.

The conditions were making it difficult to build containment lines around the fire, and sparks jumped across them.

"Weather is not working with us right now, but our guys are giving it a heck of a shot," Maketa said.

There were no immediate reports of injuries in any of the fires.

In
southern Colorado, the Bureau of Land Management said three structures 
have been lost in a fire on about 6 square miles near the Royal Gorge 
Bridge. Authorities evacuated Royal Gorge Bridge & Park.

A
third wildfire in southern Colorado erupted Tuesday in rural Huerfano 
County. The Klikus Fire had burned an estimated 45 to 50 acres west of 
La Veta, prompting evacuation orders for about 200 residences.

The cause of those fires wasn't immediately confirmed.

A
fourth wildfire sparked by lightning Monday in Rocky Mountain National 
Park quickly grew to an estimated 300 to 400 acres Tuesday. No 
structures were threatened.
