Militant trade union leader Bob Crow left a six-figure nest egg for his family when he passed away – but his ex-wife will not receive a share of it.

The former RMT chief’s partner Nicola Hoarau, 50, and the three children they had together will inherit £106,000.

However, his ex-wife, Geraldine Horan, and their daughter Kerrie, were left out of the will, according to the probate office in London, which oversees the distribution of a deceased person’s estate.

Will: Bob Crow, who passed away in March, has left £106,000 to his partner and three children

It said that Mr Crow’s estate was worth £325,000 before outstanding affairs were settled.

The fortune Ms Hoarau has inherited is mainly made up of savings and investments.

Mr Crow was 52 when he died in March this year from a massive heart attack.

He cut a controversial figure – adored by his union members, but often heavily criticised by commuters and politicians for his eagerness to call Tube strikes in London while enjoying a champagne lifestyle.

Woodford home: Mr Crow lived in publicly funded council accommodation despite earning six figures

The RMT leader rose from a modest background to running an organisation with 80,000 members on a six-figure pay deal.

Mr Crow was elected to run the RMT in 2002, catapulting him to national fame - and notoriety - as the most radical of a new generation of union leaders.

Crow liked to be seen as a working-class hero, but was paid £145,000 a year, enjoyed fine dining in top London restaurants — memorably once quaffing champagne and running up a £650 lunch bill with four of his Left-wing brothers — and recently sparked a furore by taking a cruise to Latin America just before yet another of his strikes.

Crow also came under fire for taking a holiday to Brazil on the eve of one Tube strike. But he defended his holiday, saying: 'What do you want me to do? Sit under a tree and read Karl Marx every day?'

He also came in for criticism because of his insistence on living in publicly funded council accommodation in the north of the capital despite his hefty salary.

However, the outspoken union boss always refused to apologise, saying that he deserved his pay packet, and insisted he had a right to live in the home which he shared with Ms Hoarau, an RMT employee.

Mr Crow spied Nicola Hoarau in the street near his Woodford home after his marriage to Ms Horan had failed.

Immediately he was smitten. Having obtained her phone number, he left her a message: ‘I know where you live, but I’m not a stalker. I’m going to stand under the lamp-post outside your home. If you don’t like what you see, don’t come down.’

She did like what she saw, and they were together for the next 20 years.

Outside politics, Mr Crow was a passionate supporter of Millwall Football Club, where he would go to watch games with his father.

He was also fanatically interested in the weather, once saying: 'I spend ages looking at weather maps and graphs.

'I have a barometer in the house and if I could have been anything else other than a union official I would have been a footballer - or a weatherman.'
