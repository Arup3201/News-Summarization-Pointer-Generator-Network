An American explorer recently became the first person to make it to the world's largest beaver dam, after trekking more than a week through 200 miles of unforgiving wilderness in northern Canada.

Rob Mark, 44, of Maplewood, New Jersey, successfully made it to the dam located in Alberta's Wood Buffalo National Park on July 20, braving 'horrific' mosquitoes and dangerous swampland to be the first human to see the natural wonder in person. 

The beavers may have started construction on the 2,790-foot-long dam in 1975, but it was only discovered by researchers using Google Earth in October 2007. 

A first: New Jersey adventurer Rob Mark recently became the first man to visit the world's largest beaver dam in far northern Alberta, Canada 

Amazing find: The dam was discovered by researchers in October 2007, who spotted it on Google Earth 

 'Just to be able to be the first to walk somewhere where no one else did, it felt impressive. I was pretty impressed with myself,' Mark told the Edson Leader. 

He says the most difficult part of the journey was battling the insatiable mosquitoes, which sounded like 'helicopters', and were worse than the bugs he faced spending a month in the Amazon. 

Mark wore a rain jacket the whole time, to stop the mosquitoes biting through his clothes, and spent the nights sleeping in a hammock, draped in bug netting.

'Just to be able to be the first to walk somewhere where no one else did, it felt impressive. I was pretty impressed with myself,' Mark told the Edson Leader

The final mile of the journey was the most difficult, and took Mark five hours, since he had to keep himself from sinking into the constant waist-deep sludge. 

'Every step you take is nerve-wracking because you don’t know how deep you’re going to sink in, and then your foot gets stuck and you have to lay down and pull it out. It’s just really, really hard going. The entire time I would never take a step without holding on to a willow or some sort of foliage,' Mark told GrindTV Outdoor.

But it was worth the struggle to see the engineering marvel built by the industrious beaver colony. 

Hard to see: Mark says the beaver dam doesn't photograph well since it's completely overgrown in foliage 

Angry beaver: The whole day Mark spent at the dam, he only saw one beaver which slapped its tail against the water in anger

'It was the only hard ground around for miles so I was happy to stand on it,' he said.  

However, the dam is a marvel to be witnessed in person, since it doesn't photograph well.  

'When I got there I expected to see a big beautiful dam,' Mark told GrindTV. 'It’s huge, but it’s not tall and there’s nothing to take a picture of. It’s completely covered with dirt and it’s completely overgrown. So there was no nice beaver dam face to take a picture of or anything like that.'

And for such a large dam, Mark only saw one beaver the entire day he was there.  

'It was incredibly angry when I was there,' Mark told the Edmonton Journal. 'It kept slapping its tail against the water.'

The return trip only took Mark three days. 

It was his second attempt reaching the beaver dam. He failed to reach the dam two years ago, due to bad weather. 

The second largest beaver dam in the world is 2,139 feet and is located in Three Forks, Montana.
