Great Britain’s Elise Christie gave her confidence a much-needed lift as she secured bronze in the 1,000m final at the World Cup short track event in Seoul.

One week after taking a tumble in the 500m final in Shanghai, Christie fared better over the longer distance

She finished with a time of one minute 33.449 seconds to come in behind China’s Han Yutong and Marianne St-Gelais of Canada.

The 24-year-old Scotswoman only recently returned to the rink after a hat-trick of disqualifications blighted her appearance at the Sochi Winter Olympics in February.

She received threatening messages on social media during the 2014 Winter Olympics.
