Florida Gulf Coast basketball coach Andy Enfield took to court with his wife and family for his team's final practice before their historic NCAA tournament match-up tonight.

The underdog college shocked the nation earlier this week when they became the first 15th seed to the advance to the Sweet Sixteen stage of the tournament.

And Enfield and his wife Amanda- who gave up a modelling career where she starred in ad campaigns for Victoria's Secret, Armani and Chanel- have taken the media by storm.

She was seen holding their son Marcum, whose name is her maiden name, while they watch ‘dad’ at work with his team in the Cowboys stadium in Arlington, Texas. The relatively unknown team will face off their in-state rivals of Florida State University on Friday, which will determine whether they last one more round in the annual tournament.

Star off the court: Amanda Enfield, the wife of the Florida Gulf Coast coach Andy Enfield, has earned a good deal of attention due to her model looks

Cheering squad: She was spotted with the couple's nearly 2-year-old son Marcum watching the team practice in the Texas stadium on Thursday in preparation for their big game on Friday

Family portrait: Amanda has shunned her new-found bout of fame, saying that she has no plans to return to modeling and prefers to raise their three children at home

Amanda, 34, says that she has ‘mixed emotions’ about the new wave of attention that she has been granted in light of her husband’s success on the court, but because she already had her brush with modelling fame at an early age, she seems reluctant to pursue a second round.

'I never expected this. I'm flattered, and I think it's great, but it's also kind of crazy to me,' she said in an interview with USA Today.

‘I guess it's kind of cool but it's still a bit surreal to me.

‘I just don't think I should be the focus at all. The team is the biggest story. The best part is seeing Andy and the players have their dreams actually come true. They are so happy.’

Dad's turn: Andy Enfield and his team, including player Brett Comer seen playing with Marcum, have become the unlikely Cinderella story of the NCAA tournament due to their unexpected success

Instead she is happy staying a full-time mom to her three children: daughters Aila, 6, and Lily, 5, with son Marcum turning 2 next month.

Basketball has had an integral role in the couple’s relationship, as they met at a regional tournament when her native Oklahoma State team was playing in New York and he was passing through town with a mutual friend on the way to a NCAA tournament.

He proposed by hiding the engagement ring in a box of Krispy Kreme donuts, and the rest is history.

‘She was still in the prime of her modelling career. For her to give up that to be a coach's wife and have children is something in itself. She is an amazing (mother),’ Enfield said of his wife.

She is just one of the reasons why the team is getting an unexpected amount of attention in this year’s March Madness.

They shocked the nation by staging two massive upsets- beating Georgetown and San Diego State- in the NCAA men's basketball tournament and becoming the first 15-seed team ever to reach the Sweet Sixteen round.

In addition to their basketball skills, the team has earned themselves a spot as fan favorites with on the court antics that include dunks, laughs, and now a coordinated dance.

Enfield said his key to victory has always been a work hard-play hard mentality.

'We don't take ourselves too seriously,' said Florida Gulf Coast coach Andy Enfield, whose players tossed him in the air and doused him with water in a raucous celebration before his postgame interviews.

'We try to have fun, get serious when we have to. Our goal was to make history and we did it.'

A week ago, Florida Gulf Coast 
University was just another overlooked No. 15 seed - a longshot at best 
to nearly everyone eyeballing their NCAA tournament brackets.

Now the Eagles are the high-flying 
show from 'Dunk City' in the round of 16, the darlings of the South 
Regional and a bracket-busting team everybody is talking about even when
surrounded by former national champions Michigan, Kansas and Florida.

'Things have changed dramatically,' FGCU coach Enfield said.

'The way we looked at it, we did make
history. ... We feel like we shocked the world,' said Brett Comer, the 
guard with 22 points and 24 assists in two NCAA games.

'Nobody picked us to beat Georgetown, or San Diego State, for sure. We're going to prepare for Florida the same way. We're going to try to win again.'

The Eagles are in the round of 16 in only their second season being eligible for the NCAA tournament. Florida, a state school with nearly 50,000 students, has a roster loaded with NCAA experience.

It is the first time that two teams from the same state have meet in this round of the NCAA tournament.

Big win: Florida Gulf Coast's made its first big statement on Friday night when the little-known team beat Georgetown, one of the top-ranked teams in the tournament

Hang time: Georgetown's defeat was the first upset of the tournament that resonated across the country

Florida, which won consecutive national 
titles in 2006 and 2007, has been to regional finals each of the last 
two years. But this is the last chance for seniors Kenny Boynton, Erik 
Murphy and Mike Rosario to get a championship of their own.

‘We remember the pain it caused for us
last year,’ Boynton said. ‘I think we used it to learn. ... We've been 
close. And our goal is to get further this year.’

The Gators, Kansas, Marquette and Ohio
State are the only teams in the NCAA round of 16 for the third season 
in a row. It is the first time Florida has done that.

Orangemen win: Top-seed Indiana had no answer for Syracuse, and now the Hoosiers are heading home after a 61-50 loss Thursday night bounced them from the NCAA tournament

Moving on: Ohio State advanced to the West Regional final with a 73-70 victory over Arizona on Thursday night

The Shockers shock: Wichita State went from sweet to elite, beating La Salle 72-58

Yet, most of the attention is going to
the smaller school about 250 miles away that the Gators have played 
only once before. That was a 94-60 Florida victory at home in 2008, when
Florida Gulf Coast was in only its second season of Division I 
competition.

Florida Gulf Coast did play this 
season against the third Florida team that made it to the round of 16. 
The Eagles won 63-51 at home Nov. 13 against Miami, the ACC 
regular-season and tournament champion and No. 2 seed in the East 
Regional.

Florida presents quite a challenge, 
ranked second nationally allowing only 54 points a game. But neither 
Georgetown or San Diego State allowed much more than that.

‘We're playing against a really, 
really good team that's playing as well as anybody in the country right 
now. And they've had some incredible runs,’ Florida coach Billy Donovan 
said.

‘I know there are a lot of nice stories out there. But we've got focus on the stuff that we need to do going into the game.’
