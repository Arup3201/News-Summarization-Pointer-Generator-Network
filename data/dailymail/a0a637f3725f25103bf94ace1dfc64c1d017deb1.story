Anger: Labour councillor Steven Bayes is said to be furious after being arrested for gross indecency

The deputy chairman of the Co-op group’s board of directors was once arrested in a Belfast hotel room with his then teenage boyfriend for  suspected gross indecency.

Labour councillor Steven Bayes, who had been tipped to succeed Lord Prescott as a Hull MP before the incident, was detained because his partner was under the legal age of consent at the time.

The disclosure came as Co-op members yesterday voiced their concerns about the company at a meeting in York following the scandal over Paul Flowers.

But Co-op spokesmen said no criticisms of board members were discussed during the North Area Committee meeting, attended by about 70 delegates.

Mr Bayes, a long-standing Hull city councillor, was held on suspicion of gross indecency and other offences when police raided the Holiday Inn hotel where he was staying in 2007.

The former chairman of the Humberside Police Authority was in the city with his 17-year-old partner Dale Martin, whom he had met on the internet. At the time the age of consent for gay sex in the province was 18, though it has subsequently been reduced to 16 to fall in line with the rest of the UK.

The Public Prosecution Service decided to take no action, saying it was not in the public interest.

But Mr Bayes was suspended by the Labour Party in Hull for several months and withdrew from the process of selecting a successor to former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott, who stepped down as MP for Hull East in 2010.

The openly gay councillor and Mr Martin, with whom he now lives, tried to take legal action against the police and prosecution authorities in Northern Ireland, saying their actions had been discriminatory and breached their rights to privacy. But their bid for a judicial review failed, largely because of delays in applying for it.

Mr Bayes, 52, later criticised the police handling of the case, which had included searches of his home, the Guildhall in Hull and the House of Commons where he had worked as a researcher  for an MP. He was quoted as saying: ‘The police just came in with their big stomping feet all over everything and didn’t look at it, bearing in mind the law was changing.’

Mr Bayes, who was paid £34,000 last year for his work for the  Co-op, joined the board in 2009.

Yesterday’s North Area Committee meeting in York reflected the growing unrest in the company over the revelations about Flowers, with an item headed the The Current Situation Facing The Co-operative Group.

One delegate standing for election to the committee wrote in the agenda: ‘Recent activity has resulted in diminishing the Co-op brand and I believe our Boards now need new, proactive members.’ But a reporter from this newspaper was told he could not attend the event, despite the public interest. Regional secretary Ed Powell said: ‘We have nothing to hide but it is a private meeting.’

In response to questions about the content of the agenda, he said: ‘The situations facing the Co-op are well publicised in the media.

‘We are going to speak to our members about the various situations facing the Co-op including concerns of the members.

‘Otherwise it is a training and development meeting held twice a year, which is in the diary.’ He refused to comment on Mr Bayes.

The programme included a warning to delegates from Mark Craig, the director of corporate relations, not to speak to the media, saying: ‘It is clearly essential that you adhere to the Group’s Code of Conduct at all times.’ He added: ‘We anticipate further media coverage. We are mindful of the need to communicate with elected members and plan to do so early next week.’

Co-op spokesman Russ Brady said: ‘It is a private meeting but the members will want to sit down and discuss among themselves their fears and feelings and talk about the allegations. One of the benefits of the Co-op as an organisation is that they will have the opportunity to do this.’

He said the revelations had been like ‘shock and awe’ and ‘the worst week of my career’ but added that ‘the Co-op does a great many things which are of benefit to the community’.

Delegates leaving the meeting at the Novotel in York last night declined to comment in detail. One said: ‘We’ve had a very good day. Very positive.’ Another replied: ‘A good day – we’re getting it sorted out.’

The Co-op said: ‘There were no charges brought against Mr Bayes so there is no comment.’

Last night Mr Bayes could not be reached for comment.
