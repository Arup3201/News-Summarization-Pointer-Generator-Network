Once, a certain senior Labour figure responded in pugilistic fashion to an egg-throwing protester.

But Ed Miliband clearly isn’t cut from the same pugnacious cloth as John Prescott.

When the Labour leader was hit on the back of the head yesterday, he simply laughed it off, saying he was ‘always looking for new ways to connect with voters’.

A contrast indeed to the moment in 2001 when then deputy prime minister Mr Prescott lashed out with a left hook after being egged by a countryside campaigner. 

Yesterday’s sticky moment came as Mr Miliband attempted to use a walkabout at a market to attack the Government over the rising cost of living.

Yolks on him: The contents of the eggs splattered over passersby and journalists after cracking on Ed Miliband's head

Splat: Ed Miliband is hit on the head by an egg during a visit to South East London's East Street Market

Joke: Mr Miliband sought to laugh off the latest egging with this message posted on Twitter

But his attempt to answer critics who 
claim he was failing to connect with voters backfired when six eggs 
rained down on his head.

It is not the first time Mr Miliband has been hit by an egg - he was struck in a similar protest in May 2012 while on the campaign trail in Southampton.

The Labour leader has been stung by criticism that his party has been silent for the last three weeks, while the coalition has set the political agenda.

His visit to the south London's East Street Market was his first return to the frontline since his summer holiday in France.

But as he tried to convince shoppers he had a plan to help people who are feeling the pinch, he was struck by several eggs.

He later wrote on Twitter: 'Thanks to all at East St Market for the warm welcome today. Can recommend it for easy availability of eggs.' 

Scotland Yard said Mr Miliband did not want police to take the matter further.

Setback: Mr Miliband had hoped to focus on a claim that the government is 'out of touch' instead of wiping egg out of his hair

Message: Labour hoped to turn the tables on the government, with wage increases outstripped by the rising cost of living

The man who threw the six eggs was 
38-year-old Dean Porter, who was homeless for five years and said he had
 travelled to the street specifically to target Mr Miliband.

As he threw the eggs he joked that he would only have voted for Mr Miliband's brother, David.

Speaking
 to reporters after the incident, Mr Porter said: 'They don't care about
 the poor, they just care about the banks, they should stop giving 
favouritism to the banks.

'The government do nothing, the shadow government do nothing. If you're poor you're considered a burden.'

After the incident he was led away from the scene by market security.

Protest: Dean Porter, pictured throwing the eggs, said he was protesting at the way the poor are treated by both the government and the opposition

Mr Miliband said: 'This is not the first time it's happened to me, I'm sure it's not the last," he said. "I'm always looking for new ways to connect with the voters.'

A surprise new poll this week showed David Cameron and George Osborne have almost doubled their lead over Labour for stewardship of the economy.

According to the ICM/Guardian survey, 40 per cent 
believe the Prime Minister and Chancellor are more capable of managing 
the economy than Ed Miliband and Ed Balls.

Just 24 per cent said the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor have the right answers – giving the Tories a 16 per cent lead.

It is a dramatic increase from a lead 
of just nine points last month, and sent shockwaves through the 
Labour party as Mr Miliband prepares for another relaunch.

Mr Miliband has faced calls to beef up his team to take on a resurgent Tory party.

Blairites called on him to recall Labour’s ‘grown-ups’ to frontline politics 
as he was accused of lacking a ‘coherent’ economic policy.

Former
 minister Chris Mullin said the Labour leader should recall big beasts 
such as former Cabinet ministers Alistair Darling and Alan Johnson to 
help rescue the party.

He said Mr Miliband needs ‘a strong, coherent case’ and ‘a credible message’.

Grownups: Many in the Labour party would like to see Alistair Darling (left) and Alan Johnson return to the frontbench

Describing them as ‘grown-ups’ he 
said on Radio 4 that Mr Darling was ‘a very good chancellor and still is
 a very credible witness on the economy’ and Mr Johnson was ‘an 
immensely credible figure’.

Mr Mullin said Labour needed to 
counter the ‘vast lie’ that Britain’s economic problems were primarily 
caused by the previous government.

He said the ‘only thing’ the party had to apologise for was not ‘regulating the banks sufficiently’.

Former spin doctor Alastair Campbell also demanded that Mr Miliband get on the front foot over the economy.

In a blog on his website, Mr Campbell
 wrote: ‘The very good record of the last Labour government has been 
blunted if not lost as a political weapon. Labour must be more robust in
 defending the record, including the Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling 
handling of the global financial crisis.’

Former minister Tony McNulty also 
said: ‘If we have little confidence defending [our] record, why should 
anyone believe our forward offer?’

Mr Miliband has spent the last three weeks on holiday, sparking unease in Labour ranks about the deafening silence of his frontbench.

With signs the economy is recovering, a growing list of MPs and advisers have warned Labour needs to up its game.

Gordon Brown's former pollster Deborah
 Mattinson warned that Labour was ‘slightly lurching from one announcement to the next, or complete silence’.

‘What
 voters need to hear is some real clarity about what Labour stands for, 
what Labour believes, how Labour now would be different from how Labour 
has been before.

And that needs to be set out with absolute clarity in a
 language that people understand.'

It comes after shadow health secretary Andy Burnham complained that Labour must 'shout louder and speak in a way that captures how people are feeling and thinking'.

Economic competence: The Tory lead over Labour for running the economy has soared from nine points in June to 16 points in August

PM David Cameron, left, and Chancellor George 
Osborne, right, have seen a sharp rise in their economic credibility, 
according to the survey

Veteran backbenchers George Mudie and Graham Stringer have also warned Mr Miliband;s policies are 'confused'.

However
 Tom Harris, who stood down from the Labour frontbench this year, 
likened Mr Miliband to Margaret Thatcher and insisted he was a 'ruthless
 b******' with the grit to win.

'The
 kind of steel within Ed Miliband is what the Tories needed nearly 40 
years ago and it's what our party needed in 2010. We still need it 
today. And by 2015 we’ll need it more than ever,' he wrote in an article
 for the Telegraph.

From April to June the economy grew by 0.6 per cent, double the 0.3 per cent seen in the first quarter of 2013.

New
 Bank of England governor Mark Carney last week raised growth forecasts 
for this year from 1.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent and for next year from 
1.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent.

Senior Tories have been careful not to declare they can see ‘green shoots’ of recovery, with Mr Osborne insisting the economy has moved only from ‘repair to recovery’.

With growth up and unemployment down, Labour has been forced to re-rite its attacks on the government, having previously accused ministers of cutting ‘too far, too fast’.

Pressure: After three weeks of almost complete silence from the Labour leadership, the poll will be another blow for Ed Miliband and Ed Balls (right)

Mr Miliband's frontbench have instead claimed that the recovery is only being enjoyed by the wealthy.

But the new message has done nothing to stop voters swinging in behind the Tory leadership’s economic strategy.

According
 to the latest ICM survey for the Guardian, the Conservative lead for 
‘competence’ on the economy is at its highest level since December 2012.

To make things worse for Labour, the same survey shows that while the party is ahead overall, it is only just.

On
 voting intentions Mr Miliband’s party leads by just 3 per cent, with 35
 per cent saying they will vote Labour compared with 32 per cent for the
 Conservatives.

Factoring in the margin of error – of plus or minus 3 per cent – shows that the lead may in fact be non-existent.

The Tories have fallen four points over the last month and Labour has gone down 1 per cent.

The
 poll is the latest blow for Mr Miliband, who is expected to return to 
the political fray this week with an attack on the government for 
falling wages in real terms.

He has faced criticism for three weeks of all but total silence from his frontbench, leaving the coalition to set the political agenda.

A much-hyped speech on immigration by frontbencher Chris Bryant turned into a fiasco when large sections attacking Tesco and Next had to be rewritten after the retail giants hit back at errors in pre-briefed extracts.

The ICM poll shows UKIP has seen its rating rise from 7 to 10 per cent.

The poll also shows 17 per cent of people think their personal financial circumstances have improved in the last year, compared to 43 per cent who say it has become worse.

A quarter believed their situation would improve in the next year.
