Craig Spencer, the doctor whose confirmed Ebola diagnosis sent New York City into a tailspin on Thursday, successfully cleared the U.S. government's newest 'enhanced' screening protocols when he returned from Africa.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Dr Spencer, who was in Guinea treating Ebola patients as part of a Doctors Without Borders team, passed inspection six days before showing symptoms and being rushed to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. 

'The healthcare worker had returned through JFK Airport on October 17 and participated in the enhanced screening for all returning travelers from these countries' affected by the virus, the CDC said in a statement.

Outrage: The CDC admitted on Thursday that its latest screening program missed the latest US Ebola patient

Hot-blooded? Arriving international passengers at JFK Airport who have been in an Ebola hot-zone country now have their temperatures taken and answer some health questions before being cleared to enter the U.S.

Dr Craig Spencer, fresh from work in Guinea with the aid group Doctors Without Borders, was diagnosed with Ebola in New York City on Thursday – despite successfully navigating the CDC's 'enhanced screening' protocol at JFK Airport

'He went through multiple layers of screening and did not have a fever or other symptoms of illness.'

The CDC's acknowledgement brought angry catcalls on Twitter on Thursday night, as Americans realized Ebola could reach the US despite security upgrades introduced following an earlier case of Ebola arriving from Africa.

'Well then,' read one post, 'it appears your 'advanced screening' is a load of bull***t. Another failure by CDC.'

The agency moved quickly to try to quell online concerns, but the effort met with little success.

Spencer 'didn't have fever or other symptoms of illness during screening; reported fever to health officials for 1st time today,' the CDC tweeted.

'So basically,' came a tweeted retort, 'screen[ing] process doesn't work to detect Ebola carriers ... Sheesh.' 

The CDC announced on Thursday that New York airline passengers who began their journeys in Liberia, Sierra Leone, or Guinea and arrive at JFK or Newark Liberty Airport will soon be subject to 'post-arrival monitoring' by state and local health departments for 21 days.

That policy, however, isn't slated to go into effect until October 27.

With an incubation period of 21 days – some health authorities put it yesterday at 42 days – Ebola has proved a tricky pathogen to spot in patients who don't suffer from fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or other symptoms.

Dr Craig Spencer rode the subway along with visiting a Brooklyn bowling alley, The Gutter, and the High Line park. It was revealed today that he had also eaten at The Meatball Shop in Greenwich Village and stopped at Blue Bottle Coffee on the High Line on Tuesday

As more cases are identified that slip through the CDC's screening system, the chorus of demands for banning travel to the U.S. from affected countries will grow louder. 

The agency has been under fire since the first U.S. Ebola diagnosis was made on September 30.

That patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, died on October 8 after contracting the virus in Liberia and returning to Dallas, Texas. 

CDC Director Thomas Frieden insisted early on that the risk of additional transmitted cases was low, although two nurses who treated Duncan fell ill with the disease.

One, Amber Vinson, was permitted to fly from Texas to Ohio and back despite having a mild fever. Public panic after her case was publicized forced the closure of schools, shops and university offices in Ohio.

September 16: Dr Craig Spencer flew to Guinea to treat Ebola patients as a member of the French organization Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontiers).

October 14: Dr Spencer departed Guinea on a flight to Brussels. He reported no symptoms.

October 17: He boarded a flight to the U.S. on Brussels Airlines Flight SN0501. Reported no symptoms.

Arrived at JFK and was screened with no symptoms upon arrival.

October 21: At 7 AM, he reported fatigue and exhaustion. No fever, vomiting, diarrhea.

At around 3:00 PM, Dr Spencer visited The Meatball Shop for 40 minutes. The Meatball Shop is located at 64 Greenwich Avenue.

Around 4:30 PM, he visited the High Line. Walked on High Line and stopped at the Blue Bottle Coffee stand (10th Ave & W 16th St)

At around 5:30 PM, he got off the High Line at 34th Street and took the 1 train to the 145th Street station.

October 22: At around 1:00 PM, Dr Spencer went running along Riverside Drive and Westside Highway.

Around 2:00 PM, he went to pick up Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm share at 143rd St and Amsterdam Avenue (Corbin Hill Farm) and picked up a box which he took to his apartment.

At around 5:30 PM, Dr Spencer left for The Gutter bowling alley in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with two friends. For his arrival at Gutter, he took the A train at 145th Street and transferred at 14th Street and took the L train to Bedford Avenue.

Around 8:30 PM, Dr Spencer left The Gutter. For his return trip, he used Uber as his means of transportation.

October 23: Around 10:15AM, he first reported a fever. At this point, he called Medecins Sans Frontieres and the New York City Health Department. He was immediately taken to Bellevue by FDNY EMS. 

How did it happen? Dr Spencer was pictured in full hazmat gear as he prepared to travel to Guinea - he could have contracted the disease in his off-hours while mingling with Guinean civilians

Critics say the CDC's screening is meaningless since it can't identify Ebola carriers who are incubating the disease and have not yet shown symptoms

Americans have lost confidence in the CDC's ability to contain Ebola, according to an Associated Press-GfK Poll released Thursday. 

Most disapprove of President Obama's handling of the outbreak, and just 1 in 5 say the CDC has handled the disease well so far.

Only 3 in 10 trust public health officials to share complete and accurate information about the virus. 

Eighteen percent have 'deep confidence' that their own local hospitals could safely treat a patient with Ebola.

'Americans are worried about ... the steps we are taking to contain Ebola,' California Rep. Darrell Issa said Friday morning on Capitol Hill.

Issa was speaking at the beginning of a hearing convened by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which he chairs.

Nina Pham: The 26-year-old Texas Health nurse, was declared Ebola-free on Friday at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. She will now return to Texas with her family and be reunited with her dog Bentley. She thanked doctors, family and the country for their 'prayers, hope and love' during her recovery. Her dog Bentley was declared Ebola-free earlier this week

Amber Vinson: The 29-year-old colleague of Miss Pham was given the all-clear on Wednesday from the virus. She was being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia

Ashoka Mukpo: The NBC cameraman, 33, was given the all-clear on Tuesday at Nebraska Medical Center after being diagnosed with Ebola last month. He said that his greatest fear about dying from Ebola was leaving behind his beloved fiancee.

Unidentified man: An Ebola patient who was being treated at Emory since early September was released earlier this week.  The man was released Sunday from Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, after he was determined to be free of the virus and no threat to the public. WHO disclosed that a doctor who had been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone had been evacuated out of Africa when he tested positive for the disease.

Thomas Eric Duncan: The Liberian man, 42, was the first case of Ebola to be diagnosed on U.S. soil. He was hospitalized on September 28 after initially being sent home from Texas Presbyterian Hospital. He died on October 8.

Dr Rick Sacra: The doctor who has spent a great deal of the last two decades as a missionary in Africa, contracted Ebola while treating Ebola patients. Dr Sacra, from Massachusetts was declared disease-free and released on September 25 after weeks of treatment at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital

Nancy Writebol: The missionary worker contracted Ebola in July and was flown from Liberia to Emory in Atlanta. She recovered several weeks later and was declared disease-free although has said she is still working to rebuild her strength. 

Dr Kent Brantly: The doctor contracted Ebola around the same time as his colleague, Nancy Writebol. Both he and Mrs Writebol received the experimental serum Z-Mapp. He was also declared Ebola free and has given multiple blood and plasma donations to help subsequent Ebola patients. 

Dr Craig Spencer: The 33-year-old Doctors without Borders volunteer is the first person to be diagnosed in New York City. The engaged medic is currently being monitored in Bellevue Hospital after being rushed from his Harlem home on Thursday night. His fiancee Morgan Dixon and two friends are being monitored after their contact with him. His treatment to date has been undisclosed and his condition is said to be stable
