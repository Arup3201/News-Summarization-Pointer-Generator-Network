Mohammed Arshad, who obtained one of the stolen passports, was able to stay in Britain illegally for five years

An illegal immigrant stayed in Britain for five years after he bought a blank passport on the black market which was among 3,600 stolen in a raid on a delivery van.

Mohammed Arshad, 49, is thought to have paid up to £1,000 for the bogus document after it was stolen in July 2008 during an 'insider job' robbery on a the van travelling to an RAF base.

The delivery driver had made an unscheduled stop at a newsagents in Chadderton, near Oldham, Greater Manchester to buy a newspaper and a Mars Bar.

The driver had left a colleague in the passenger seat only to return to see the van being driven away.

The passenger Alan Burke claimed the hijackers had forced his head onto the dashboard before driving the vehicle 100 yards down the road and raiding its contents.

But Burke was later arrested after inquiries revealed he was in cahoots with an Asian crime gang plotting to sell blank passports and visas on the black market in an immigration scam. 

In all 24 boxes containing 3,650 blank 
passports and 8,100 visas were snatched. They were due to be fielded by 
staff at RAF Northolt near London for distribution to British Embassies 
worldwide.

Around 1,500 visas and more than 2,000 
passports were recovered in 2009. And in June 2012 a further 877 of the 
stolen visas were found stuffed inside a black plastic bin liner in the 
loft of a house during a police raid.

At Minshull Street Crown Court, 
Manchester, Arshad admitted possessing identity documents with intent to
 commit fraud and was jailed for 12 months.

He
 now faces automatic deportation upon his release. He will have to pay a
 £100 victim surcharge and surrender his travel documents.

Passenger Alan Burke said the hijackers had forced his head on the dashboard as they stole the van but was later found to have been in cahoots with an Asian crime gang

Burke, 54, was jailed for four and a half
 years for conspiracy to steal. Four Asian men were locked away for a 
total of 14 years.

Arshad, Oldham, acquired one of the passports after his six month visas ran out in August 2008.

It was forged and was shown to be valid 
from 23 June 2010 until 23 June 2020 and it is believed he used it for 
identification purposes.

He was caught on Boxing Day last year at Manchester Airport when it is believed a micro chip in the passport flagged it as suspicious as as he attempted to board a flight to his native Pakistan.

His passport was examined by a forgery trained Border Force officer who identified it as one of those stolen in the raid.

After the case Det Sgt John Murdoch, 
said: 'A significant number of passports and visas were stolen in 2008 
and while many have been recovered, clearly some remain in circulation.

'We
 are not naove enough to think that people will not try and use them but
 what this case shows is that no matter how long they remain dormant, if
 someone is prepared to try them out, there are specialist officers on 
hand with the skill and expertise to spot a fake, no matter how good the
 forgery.

'Arshad was an 
illegal immigrant attempting to fly to Pakistan who will automatically 
be deported upon the completion of his sentence and while that means he 
will get to complete his journey, it will come at the expense of a 12 
month prison sentence.'

Following the theft police from the former Serious Organised Crime Agency and Greater manchester Police carried out six month operation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to track down the thieves.

This operation resulted in a number of arrests on 4 January 2009, when a car was stopped on the M62 near Oldham and was found top contain nearly 1500 visas and 1600 passports.

It emerged Burke had been involved in a similar crime in 2006, when 900 passports went missing from his care.
