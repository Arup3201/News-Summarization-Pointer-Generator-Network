Charged: Jessica Lee Jensen has been arrested for murder and neglect over her son's death

A North Dakota woman has been charged with murder and neglect over the death of her 13-year-old son, who weighed only 21lb when he died.

Jessica Lee Jensen's son died from chronic starvation caused by an eating disorder that had not been treated, a medical examiner said.

His body was so tiny and underdeveloped that when hospital staff examined him on the day he died, they first believed he was a three-year-old.

Jensen, who has two other children aged 14 and 7, told investigators that her son had a hormonal growth problem, and that his pituitary gland did not function properly.

The 35-year-old added that her son, identified locally as Aidan Edward Bossingham, had not been to a doctor for several years.

The mother-of-three home-schooled her children in a property that was described by police as being filthy and smelling of feces, the Dickson Press reported.

She claimed that Aidan had eaten a small amount on the day he died, but the state medical examiner said the boy's stomach was empty.

Dr William Massello added there was no evidence of damage to the throat that would indicate recent or regular vomiting.

The medical examiner, who listed the death as a homicide, added that the conditions the child had could have been treated.

When police were called to the family's home on January 12, they found Jensen sitting on a couch with her son in her arms.

Jensen allegedly told a 911 dispatcher her son had 'passed', and an officer struggled to try to give the child mouth-to-mouth resuscitation because rigor mortis had already set in.

The first nurse to examine the body said Aidan appeared to have been dead for some time.

Although he had been treated in hospital several times when he was younger, medical records showed Aidan was last seen by a doctor in 2008.

A human growth hormone deficiency, which can be treated, was diagnosed but medical notes from 2008 reported Aidan had 'very poor growth because of lack of treatment'.

Jensen allegedly told police her children did not have a doctor because she was able to 'solve problems', according to court documents.

She had been home-schooling her children for years, but police said only one shelf containing primary education materials was found in the house.

Relatives also claimed they had been barred from having contact with Aidan after confronting his mother about his condition.

Jensen, who could face life in prison if convicted, is next due in court on May 1. Her surviving children are currently living with relatives.
