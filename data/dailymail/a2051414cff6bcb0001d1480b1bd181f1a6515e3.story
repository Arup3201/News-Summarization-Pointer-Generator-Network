A mother who thought an indentation in her breast was a result of an ill-fitting bra ha spoken of her devastation after her GP told her it was a symptom of breast cancer.

Lisa Roberts, 37, casually mentioned a mark on her breast at a routine appointment with her doctor.

But doctors immediately sent her to Royal Blackburn Hospital, Lancashire, for a scan and biopsy, which revealed she had breast cancer and three tumours on her spine.

When mother-of-two Lisa Roberts casually mentioned a problem she thought was caused by a badly fitted bra to her doctor, she assumed it was nothing serious. But within days, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and given the devastating news that she also had three tumours on her spine

Ms Roberts story has touched dozens of people who have donated £12,000 to help pay for possible treatment in America.

And Ms Roberts hopes more lives will 
be saved by her one-woman crusade to urge women, and men, to regularly 
check their breasts for the early signs of cancer.

Ms Roberts, of Banbury Avenue, Oswaldtwistle in East Lancashire, was diagnosed in January and is still undergoing treatment. 

At
a routine doctor’s appointment, Ms Roberts mentioned an indentation in 
her breast which she assumed was caused by an ill-fitting bra.

But she was immediately transferred 
to Royal Blackburn Hospital for a scan and biopsy and before doctors 
even had her results, a consultant told her that they were ‘99.9 per 
cent sure it was cancer’.

Ms
Roberts said: ‘There’s a lot of misinformation out there and even 
people that do check their breasts tend to think that all they need to 
look out for are lumps and that’s not the case.

‘I hadn’t felt ill and had no other symptoms at all so it’s really important that both men and women know what to look out for.’

Ms Roberts said: 'There's a lot of misinformation out there and even people that do check their breasts tend to think that all they need to look out for are lumps and that's not the case. I hadn't felt ill and had no other symptoms at all so it's really important that both men and women know what to look out for.'

A week later, the diagnosis was confirmed and a private PET scan showed the tumours in her spine.

She was told her condition was ‘incurable’ but she said: ‘They haven’t said that it’s terminal and I’m hopeful that with treatment, I will be able to live to see my children grow up.

‘You have down days and I do look at my children sometimes and it all just hits me.

‘I wonder how long I’ll be able to tuck them in bed and it is heartbreaking.

‘I’ve been honest with them about everything though, and they are happy and healthy and an absolute credit to me.

‘In spite of everything they are going through, they are still smiling and still doing brilliantly at school.

‘They make me so proud and want to fight to be there for them.’

When a group of lively friends created a sponsored walk event on Facebook to raise money to send her and her children on holiday, they were inundated with requests from people who wanted to get involved and donate money.

A committee was formed and an official campaign was launched in March, aiming to raise awareness of breast cancer and raise money for possible treatments.

Ms Roberts has had chemotherapy and this week underwent a mastectomy, but the tumours in her spine will prove harder to treat.

She was put on a course of medication which would increase her life expectancy but the treatment was stopped when it was found to be affecting her heart.

To date, Ms Roberts’ Kick Cancer Campaign has raised more than £12,000 which will be put towards specialist treatment in America.

Lynda Corben, committee leader for the Kick Cancer Campaign said: ‘She is still recovering from her surgery at the moment but when she’s feeling better, we are going to look at arranging the trip to Houston, Texas for a consultation.’

Ms Corben’s husband was diagnosed with cancer in April and had his oesophagus removed on the same day Ms Roberts had her operation.

Ms Corben said: ‘Lisa had always said to my husband that she would hold his hand all the way through and they really did. They were in beds next to each other in intensive care. It was unbelievable.

‘She is such a courageous, inspirational and selfless girl. As soon as she found out about my husband, she said “you use the money”.

‘Of course, we never would but that’s just what she’s like. Always thinking of how she can help others.’

Ms Roberts added: ‘I never expected anything like this and I would never have asked for money from anyone - but if there is one life that this campaign can save, then it’s worth it.

‘I tell all my friends all the time and I’m sure they get sick of me, but I just can’t say it enough - check, check, check!’
