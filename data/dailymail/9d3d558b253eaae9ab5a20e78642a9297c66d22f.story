A despairing Nicolas Sarkozy was bracing himself for a crushing end to his political career today as campaigning closed in the French presidential election.

Showing the signs of strain in the 
closely run French election, president Nicolas Sarkozy yesterday 
admitted that he might be defeated when voters go to the polls on 
Sunday.

The political leader, who has been 
desperately trying to hang on in a political race with his main rival 
Francois Hollande, indicated that he was already looking at a life 
outside the political arena.

Feeling the pressure: Nicolas Sarkozy delivers a speech during a final campaign meeting before the second round of the French presidential elections on Sunday. He has admitted that his party may be defeated

Popular candidate: Socialist Party leader Francois Hollande is the favourite to triumph in Sunday's French elections, with most pundits saying only a major upset could scupper his chances

Hanging on: Despite large rallies like the one in Toulon yesterday, Mr Sarkozy has admitted that he could be facing defeat after only one five-year term as French president

He
was quoted in The Times today as saying: 'I think we can win, but if 
the French people decide otherwise, that is their right. At that moment 
another life starts.'

But, where Mr Sarkozy might appear 
resigned to his fate, Mr Hollande said he could not rule out the 
possibility of defeat as well, given Mr Sarkozy’s background as a wily 
political campaigner.

Mr Hollande said: ‘The polls are 
there, and they show a closing of the gap. So I say to all those who 
want me to be the next president, don’t let others decide in your 
place.'

Polls suggested that the 57-year-old was due to be rejected after a single term, so allowing Francois Hollande to take power.

Mr Hollande, also 57, would become 
France’s first Socialist president if he wins the second round of the 
bitterly fought election on Sunday.

Final polls suggest that Mr 
Hollande’s lead has narrowed to as low as five per cent from 10 per 
cent, but Mr Sarkozy came second in the first round and other party 
chiefs have failed to back him.

National Front leader Marine Le Pen 
told her six million plus supporters to ‘vote blank’, while centrist 
party head Francois Bayrou said he would vote for Mr Hollande.

Two top French TV networks say at least 19.5 million people - about a third of France's population - tuned in to a spirited debate between President Nicolas Sarkozy and Socialist Francois Hollande.French newspapers on Thursday generally described the debate the previous night as brisk, even aggressive, between the candidates who square off in Sunday's race finale.Sarkozy - the conservative incumbent - failed to land a knockout blow against Hollande, who has led polls for months.Joint debate presenters TF1 and France-2 TV reported a peak audience of 19.5 million viewers.Audience tracker Mediametrie says 20 million people tuned in to the 2007 debate between Sarkozy and Socialist Segolene Royal.

Mr Sarkozy’s best hope of being 
re-elected involved winning the support of around 80 per cent of Ms Le 
Pen’s votes and at least half of Mr Bayrou's.

But Mr Bayrou, who came fifth in the 
first round with nine per cent of the vote, attacked Mr Sarkozy’s 
increasingly extreme pledges on immigration and Europe.

Mr Sarkozy has been desperately 
trying to win over National Front supporters, saying that there are ‘too
many immigrants in France’ and that they are not being integrated 
properly.

Branding Mr Sarkozy an extremist, Mr 
Bayrou said: ‘The line Nicolas Sarkozy chose between the two rounds is 
violent. It contradicts our values.’

Today Mr Sarkozy said that Mr 
Hollande ‘would lead the country to bankruptcy’, and has frequently 
accused his Socialist rival of being ‘a liar’, including during a live 
TV debate on Wednesday.  

But Mr Hollande said he could not 
rule out the possibility of not winning, given Sarkozy’s background as a
wily political campaigner.

He said: ‘Where [Sarkozy] made a mistake is that he underestimated me,.'

Mr Hollande told RTL radio, adding: 
‘In politics, he who underestimates is too confident in himself and 
shows a lack of judgment.’

Defeat for Sarkozy will mean he will 
become the first president since Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1981 to 
fail in a re-election bid.

Mr Hollande, in turn, will become the first Socialist president of France since Francois Mitterand retired in 1995.

Mr Hollande has promised a 
wide-ranging left-wing programme, including a top tax rate of 75 per 
cent and the creation of thousands of new public sector jobs, including 
60,000 new teachers.

He said he ‘dislikes the rich’ and had already singled out ‘the world of finance’ as his principal enemy.

A Hollande win is likely to see a 
huge influx of wealthy French people into the UK, as those who fear 
sky-high taxes leave their own country.

Support: The debate ¿ broadcast on France's two main terrestrial channels and on satellite news ¿ was expected to be watched by more than half of the country's 44.5 million voters

Estate agents in London are already reporting increased interest in properties from clients from the other side of the Channel.

The final polls by Ipsos and BVA 
today suggested that Mr Hollande’s lead had narrowed by one point, with 
52.5 per cent support compared Mr Sarkozy's 47.5 per cent.

Surveys by CSA and Harris Interactive showed Mr Hollande’s lead at 53 per cent support to Sarkozy's 47 per cent.

Voting in the election begins in 
France’s overseas territories on Saturday, and in mainland France on 
Sunday. The results of official exit polls should be available by Sunday
evening.
