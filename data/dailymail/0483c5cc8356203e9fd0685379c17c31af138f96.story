Viewers have criticised Olympic medallist Chris Boardman for not wearing a helmet while cycling around Manchester for a BBC programme on cycling safety.

Hundreds of angry viewers have taken to social media to complain that the champion cyclist set a bad example by wearing dark clothing and no helmet for a cycling safety segment on BBC Breakfast this morning.

Mr Boardman was shown riding five miles around the streets of Manchester with presenter Louise Minchin as he gave his top tips for cycling safely in Britain's cities.

Viewers have criticised Olympic medallist Chris Boardman (pictured left with presenter Louise Minchin) for not wearing a helmet while cycling around Manchester for a BBC Breakfast programme on cycling safety

But while Ms Minchin wore a cycle helmet and bright yellow visibility jacket, Mr Boardman, who has his own brand of cycle helmets, was seen in a dark coat and jeans.

He later said in a video posted on the BBC Breakfast Facebook page that he didn't wear a helmet because it 'discourages people from riding a bike' and 'you are as safe riding a bike as you are walking.'

But more than 300 viewers complained he was being irresponsible for not wearing a helmet, particularly as the segment was shown as children were getting ready for the school run.

More than 300 viewers took to social media to complain he was being irresponsible for not wearing a helmet

Viewer John Stimpson wrote: 'Chris Boardman wearing no helmet and riding in black jacket and jeans. For an item on cycling safety you can't get more stupid.'

Another viewer, Benjamin Holden, added: 'Not only is he not wearing a helmet but he's also wearing dark clothing in stark contrast to the presenter who is appropriately dressed in high a visibility jacket. For a so called 'hero' of cycling he is setting an extremely bad example!!!'

Rebecca Townson said: 'His comments make me so angry. A friend of ours had a serious bike accident and he was told if he hadn't been wearing his helmet he would've been killed.

'His helmet was smashed up. My husband came off once and cracked his helmet. If we all took Chris boardmans advice, that would've been his head. The man is a fool!!!'

Viewer Charles Thody said: 'Unbelievable! No helmet and dark clothing - get real Mr Boardman!! Lack of respect from me I'm afraid.'

Colin Field was furious that his children had seen the piece before school and wrote: 'So Mr Boardman will have no problem refunding me for the Boardman branded helmet I wear?

'His argument based on general accident statistics is nonsensical and sends a much more dangerous message to children.

'I have just spent 10 minutes explaining his argument to my three daughters who now question safety and feel less sure about being safe on a bike. Well done Chris, you idiot.'

Viewer Lou Lessiter added: 'I'm a normal cyclist, I wear normal clothes, I also wear a helmet! Enough said, I now think you're a bigger idiot than I did before! You have lost all credibility & respect as has the BBC for allowing you air time!'

Mr Boardman explained his reason for not wearing a helmet in a video posted this morning.

He said: 'It's a very long answer and more time than we've got here, but it discourages people from riding a bike. You are as safe riding a bike as you are walking.

One angry viewer wrote on Facebook: 'For a so called 'hero' of cycling he is setting an extremely bad example'

'Statistically you are much safer than going in your own bathroom and you don't wear a helmet there.

'There is absolutely nothing wrong with helmets, but it's not in the top 10 things you can do to keep safe.

'We're going to look at all those things, but for me I want bikes to be for normal people in normal clothes.

'About 0.5 per cent of people wear helmets in the Netherlands and yet it's the safest country in the world and there's a reason for that.' 

A BBC spokesman said: 'Wearing a cycle helmet is not a legal requirement. It’s a matter of individual choice and the BBC is not able to force Chris to wear one.

'Our presenter Louise Minchin did wear a helmet during the filming. BBC Breakfast has also featured campaigns calling for cycle helmets to be worn.'  

Paul Tuohy, Chief Executive of CTC, the national cycling charity said: 'The furore around Chris Boardman not wearing a helmet shows how far the health and safety lobby has scared people off from the health and money saving benefits of cycling. 

'Instead of relying on polystyrene a better solution would be to create proper provision for cycling so that your child or granny would feel safe on our roads.' 

Mr Boardman defended his choice and said helmets are 'not in the top 10 things you can do to keep safe'

Ed Morrow, campaigns officer for Brake, the road safety charity, said: 'Brake encourages cycle helmet use as an easy step to protect yourself from head injury in the event of a crash.

'However, cycling injuries can take many other forms, which is why the most important thing to focus on is making sure people on bikes aren’t being hit in the first place – by improving driver awareness, rolling out more 20mph limits, and building safe cycle routes into our road infrastructure at every stage. 

'That way, we can create a road environment where far more people feel safe to cycle, and reap the undeniable health, environmental and economic benefits that result.' 

Mr Boardman has also written a statement on the British Cycling website defending his decision to not wear a helmet.

In it, he wrote: 'People wear helmets and high vis as they feel it’s all they can do to keep themselves safe. It shows just how far away Britain is from embracing cycling as a normal and convenient form of transport.' 

He cites Utrecht in the Netherlands, where helmet use is less than 0.5 per cent but they have a good safety record and 'some of the lowest casualty rates of anywhere in the world'.

He added: 'I want cycling in the UK to be like it is in Utrecht or Copenhagen and more recently New York City - an everyday thing that people can do in everyday clothes whether you are eight or 80 years old. 

'I want cycling to be a normal thing that normal people do in normal clothes. Is that wrong?'

BBC Breakfast is running a week of special reports on cycling and started today with Mr Boardman's top tips for safe cycling.

The reports come as figures from the Department of Transport show that for every hour cycled in England you are 16 times more likely to be killed or seriously injured on a bike than driving a car.

The Government wants to double the number of cyclists over the next 10 years.

At the moment only one per cent of journeys under a mile are taken by bike.

The Department of Transport's Think! road safety campaign recommends wearing a correctly fitted cycle helmet, which is securely fastened and conforms to current regulations when cycling.
