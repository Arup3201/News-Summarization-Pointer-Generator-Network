A 77-year-old gardener and his 68-year-old partner have become Britain’s oldest couple to be fitted with electronic tags.

Ian Bartlett and Rosemary Collier were fitted with the tracking devices after they pleaded guilty to stealing thousands of pounds from a vulnerable pensioner.

Their victim, Patricia Hardy, hired Bartlett to work in her garden in Whitstable, Kent, in 2007 as she  was recovering from a stroke, Canterbury Crown Court heard, and was introduced to Collier soon afterwards.

'Despicable': Ian Bartlett and his partner Rosemary Collier have become Britain's oldest couple to be tagged after they stole thousands of pounds from a stroke victim as she lay in hospital

Within a year Bartlett was so trusted 
by Mrs Hardy, who was in her early 80s, that he was handed  her 
chequebook and bank card to pay bills for her.

When Mrs Hardy was hospitalised in 
2010, Bartlett and Collier withdrew £2,100 from her bank account over a 
two-month period. They also contacted her lawyers in a bid to get her 
car, a Toyota Yaris worth £3,000, signed over to them. When this failed,
the pair, who have a combined age of 145, simply took it anyway.

In restraints: The couple must wear the tags on their legs as part of a four-month curfew

But suspicions were raised when  a 
nurse spotted them rifling through Mrs Hardy’s bag and locker at  the 
hospital, the court heard  last week.

When police searched the couple’s home
they found a puzzle book filled with attempts to forge Mrs Hardy’s 
signature, which Collier tried to ‘snatch’ off a police officer when he 
picked it up.

Andrew Walklate, prosecuting, said 
detectives initially investigated what had happened to £17,000 of the 
victim’s cash but the case was allowed to proceed when they admitted 
stealing £2,100 in April and May 2010, as well as the car.

He added that prior to her death last 
year at the age of 85, Mrs Hardy expressed anger that the couple were 
banned from visiting her as she regarded them as ‘good friends’.

Oliver Kirk, defending, admitted: ‘This was the exploitation of a vulnerable person who had been a trusted friend.’

Judge Michael O’Sullivan told  the 
pair: ‘You should be ashamed of what you did. This lady trusted you 
implicitly. You plundered her account. Your behaviour can only be 
described as despicable.’

The couple, who have three children, 
five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, were jailed for ten 
months each, suspended for a year, and ordered to repay £2,100 to Mrs 
Hardy’s estate.

Can't go out: The curfew prevents the pensioners from leaving their house (not pictured) in Tankerton (above), Kent, between 7pm and 7am

They were also given electronic tags 
to enforce a four-month curfew preventing them from leaving their home 
in Tankerton, Kent, between 7pm and 7am.

Speaking after the sentencing, retired
caterer Collier said: ‘We didn’t steal anything from Pat. She was our 
friend and we were helping her out because she had no one else to.

‘Any money that we took from her we 
used to buy her shopping and pay bills – we didn’t keep any of it and we
always told her what we were using the money for.’

She said the signatures in the puzzle 
book had been Mrs Hardy trying to practise following her stroke and 
added: ‘I used to go swimming, but now I don’t want to go to the pool 
because I’m embarrassed about the tag. We haven’t even told our children
about it because we don’t want them to know.’
