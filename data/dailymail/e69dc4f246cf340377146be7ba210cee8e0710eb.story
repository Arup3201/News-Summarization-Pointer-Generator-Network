Scientists have discovered tectonic plates hidden deep within the Earth's mantle, which they say rewrite 40 years of history about the evolution 
of western North America.

It has long been thought that North 
America's mountainous west was formed - at a time when dinosaurs prowled the earth - by the movement of an undersea plate called Farallon in a process similar to the
way a supermarket conveyor belt moves with groceries on top.

Millions of years ago, the tectonic plate moved eastward beneath the continent, dragging islands along with it until they smashed and reformed along
the west coast, forming the mountainous ridges of the wild west, scientists had previously thought.

This 3-D image renders the mountainous topography of the western U.S., and the ancient oceanic plate from the surface down to 1500 km depth (colour changes in depth increments of 200 km)

But revising 200million years of geologic history in what has been described as a 'eureka moment', a research group now claims that the process involved not 
just one but several plates that remain hidden deep within the 
Earth's mantle.

Scientists at Ludwig Maximilians 
University in Munich and the British Columbia Geological Survey used seismic tomography, or earthquake shockwaves, to create a 
three-dimensional map of these massive crust plates, which are now languishing some 500
to 1,200 miles beneath the Earth's surface.

The plate relics, according to lead author and geophysicist Karin Sigloch and  her colleague Mitch Mihalynuk, look like almost vertical walls, hundreds of feet thick.

The authors propose that the newly named
Angayucham and Mezcalera plates may have existed beneath long-vanished 
seas.

They claim there were sandwiched, and overrun, by a westward-moving North 
American plate and eastward-moving Farallon plates, the LA Times reports.

Sigloch found the plates are colder and denser than the surrounding 
mantle rock, and that seismic waves change speed as they pass through the 
plates, revealing their location.

No one had seen the plates in such detail before because it requires powerful computers and 
seismic monitoring equipment, both of which were only developed in the last decade.

The study was published in the journal Nature, on Wednesday, Live Science reports.

'The largest wall runs from northwest Canada to the eastern U.S.A. and on to Central America, and has been called the Farallon slab, one of the most massive features in global tomographies,' authors wrote. 

'We argue that in fact most of this slab wall is not Farallon and subdivide it into the Angayucham, Mezcalera and the Southern Farallon components.'

Mihalynuk told Live Science: 'It will take a while to turn people around. 
That intellectual ship has a lot of inertia... this is one of those eureka moments.'

The authors have said a further study was needed to understand the whole of the 'jigsaw puzzle'.

'Poorly understood, such collisions are of broad scientific interest' authors wrote.

'They cause rapid geographic changes, affecting climate, ocean circulation, biota and the formation of economically important mineral deposits.' 

The old WestThe story begins 200 million years ago, just before the Atlantic Ocean basin first opened. North America was crammed into the Pangaea supercontinent and the vast Panthalassa Ocean covered the rest of the planet.Panthalassa's ocean floor has almost completely disappeared under North America as Earth's tectonic plates have shifted., so its history is somewhat cryptic. A few geologic clues led scientists to the prevailing model, contested by the new study. The puzzle pieces include the few remaining bits of Panthalassic ocean floor, rocks scattered along western North America, and remnants of the old oceanic crust seen under the continent, where the plate disappeared into the mantle, the layer of Earth beneath the crust.Pangaea supercontinentAfter North America started shifting to the west 185 million years ago, away from Africa and Europe, the prevailing model placed a subduction zone along the West Coast that consumed Panthalassa's huge oceanic tectonic plate, the Farallon plate. Imagine a setting like today's Andes in South America. Like a giant conveyor belt, the subduction zone delivered exotic terranes that built out the western continent.But for some scientists, the puzzle pieces just didn't fit this picture. Sigloch and Mihalynuk think they know why.Sigloch looked deep into the mantle, at the remnants of oceanic crust that remain beneath North America. In a subduction zone, two of Earth's tectonic plates collide and one slides into the mantle. The plates are colder and denser than the surrounding mantle rock. Seismic waves change their speed as they pass through the plates, revealing their location. No one had seen these old pieces of crust in this detail before because it requires powerful computers and very dense arrays of seismic monitoring equipment, both of which came about in the last decade.Sigloch discovered a vertical pile of oceanic crust segments stacked on top of one another like bricks. The massive wall runs from northwest Canada to Central America, and is 250 to 375 miles wide (400 to 600 kilometers) and extends from between 500 to 1,200 miles (800 to 2,000 km) beneath the surface.

These former slabs, as geologists call subducted crust, fix the position of Panthalassa's ancient subduction zones in time and space, the study shows. The slabs sunk vertically about 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) per year and have not shifted in space. Because geologists know the travels of North America in detail, thanks to magnetic stripes in the Atlantic Ocean, the researchers can pull back the continent and compare it to the position of subducted crust."What this does is provide us with a time machine. The slabs are telling us the sites of past ocean trenches and the locality of island arcs, which are the building blocks of continents," said Mihalynuk, a geologist with the British Columbia Geological Survey in Canada.Two new platesWhat the mantle evidence shows is that as Pangaea broke up, out in the Panthalassa Ocean, a vast archipelago sat far offshore of North America. It was shaped like an arrowhead, 6,200 miles (10,000 km) long, with its tip pointing to the proto-Pacific Northwest. Two ocean basins sat between the archipelago and North America, called the Angayucham and the Mezcalera. On the other side of the archipelago, further to the west, was the Farallon plate.Instead of an Andes-style subduction zone, with the Farallon plate sliding to the east under North America, there was a westward-dipping subduction zone, with North American crust sliding beneath the Angauychum and Mezcalera plates.western north america geologic historyMake MoneyBecome a Millionare in the Stock Market following our successful Trades!!!!http://www.timing4profit.com[Pin It] The geologic history of western North America since the Jurassic, based on subducted oceanic crust.

"If there was eastward subduction, as most people would suggest, it would leave a bread crumb trail strewn out across the mantle. That's not what you see."As North America plowed westward, with its margin sinking the two plates, it rammed into the arrow point about 150 million years ago. This impact was responsible for raising the initial Rocky Mountains, Mihalynuk said.Further west of the archipelago, the Farallon ocean plate was descending into its own subduction zone, the mantle evidence indicates.Violent tectonicsIn fact, the entire western Panthalassic was more like the Southwest Pacific, where northeast Australia collides with islands, microcontinents disappear into the Earth, and there are flip-flopping subduction zones, the study authors said."The ocean basin was not a vast abyssal plain," Mihalynuk told OurAmazingPlanet. "The situation is much more like the Southwest Pacific than offshore South America." [World's Biggest Oceans and Seas]Over time, collisions with the different subduction zones smeared exotic terranes along the continent's western margin, a rock record that has long hinted at North America's violent tectonic history. The history revealed by the mantle slabs helps explain some baffling geology, such as rocks carried 1,200 miles (2,000 km) from Mexico to Canada.

"It will take a while to turn people around. That intellectual ship has a lot of inertia," he said. But for Mihalynuk, "this is one of those eureka moments."
