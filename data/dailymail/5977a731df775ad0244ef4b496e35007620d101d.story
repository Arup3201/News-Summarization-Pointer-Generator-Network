If thought winter was petering out this week, you may be in for a chilly shock.

Parts of Britain enjoyed temperatures of up to 14C (57F) this week – a welcome reprieve after January’s heavy snowfall brought the country to a halt.

But last night snow returned to northern England and Scotland – and forecasters say more is on the way.

Temperatures will plummet to -4C 
(25F) tonight as a cold snap grips southern counties, while the snow 
showers  spread down the east coast from Yorkshire and Northumberland to
Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

Tomorrow the mercury will rise 
briefly before more snow is blown in from the west on Monday. Matt 
Dobson, forecaster for MeteoGroup, said the snowfall will not match 
January’s heavy blizzards – but warned that temperatures will fall very 
low tonight.

He said: ‘For southern areas it will be significantly colder than recently.’

The icy weather will be swept away by
a band of rain  tomorrow, with temperatures jumping dramatically to 12C
(54F). But by Monday night the bitter cold snap will return with a 
vengeance – and could bring more than 10cm (4in) of  snow to the 
Pennines and Cumbrian fells.

Mr Dobson said: ‘On Monday night we will get strong or gale-force winds and they will bring some very cold weather.

‘We can expect snow showers of up to 
30cm (12in) over the Scottish mountains,  with up to 10cm over the hills
in Yorkshire and Cumbria.

Flooding: The recent thaw and heavy rains have led to dangerous conditions in low-lying areas

‘On lower ground it will be much 
lighter – probably a thin covering of snow and certainly nothing 
compared to what we have already seen this year.

‘The south will see wintery showers on Tuesday, which may bring some snow, especially over higher ground.’

January’s heavy snowfall created 
chaos across the country. Hundreds of schools closed, flights were 
cancelled and roads and rail services hit.

But for many parts of the country the worst disruption came when temperatures rose last weekend.

Torrential rain over the weekend and at the start of the week, coupled with the thawing snow, led to

severe flooding in low-lying areas of the country.
The Environment Agency still had 28 active flood warnings in place last night.
