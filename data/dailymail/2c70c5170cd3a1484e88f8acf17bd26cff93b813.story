Mitt Romney has been spotted at 
Disneyland, a gas station and a Twilight screening since losing the election
in November but this is perhaps the oddest location for his likeness yet.

A bank in Sterling, Virginia, was robbed on Thursday by a man in a Romney mask and a Florida State University sweatshirt.

The armed man spent several minutes in the Wells Fargo branch on Thursday, calmly demanding cash from all five tellers before leaving.

Political hangout: The branch in Sterling was held up by 'Hillary Clinton' in December 2010

NBC Washington reported that local police have visited the Party City store before the city to see if anyone bought a Romney mask there before the incident. 

The perpetrator entered the bank at about 10.20 a.m on December 13 and went from teller to teller demanding money from each employee.

'Romney' left with an undisclosed amount of cash but no one was harmed during the robbery.

Strangely, this is not the first time 
that this location has been plundered by someone with the face of a 
former presidential candidate.

Political figures hold-ups have a distinguished tradition. A man with a Bob Dole mask robbed an Illinois bank in 1996

This bank, then a Wachovia branch, was held up by a six-foot-tall crook in a 
Hillary Clinton mask in December 2010.

That was the second time the bank had been robbed in the space of two months.

That suspect has never been caught. Liz Mills, a spokeswoman for Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office, told the Washington Post that it is too early in the investigation to determine whether the two cases might be related.
