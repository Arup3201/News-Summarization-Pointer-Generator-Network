A smart lock that promises to make keys history by letting you to open your front door with a secret knock has launched a Kickstarter campaign.

Sesame allows you to open your front door with a single tap on your phone as you approach it, so you don't need to fumble around getting your keys out of your pocket.

You can also teach the app your own personal secret knock, so you won't even need to take your phone out at all.

Sesame is available to pre-order for $99 (£63) or $149 (£96) dollars with an added Wi-Fi connection.

Open Sesame: the smart lock promises to replace keys with a smartphone app and module that fits over your latch. When you approach your front door, the system recognises you and open the lock for you

The module fixes over your deadbolt and can be installed in 'literally seconds'. Candy House, the start-up behind Sesame also claim that it will work with any latch in the world

Candy House, the company behind Sesame, claim that their smart lock Sesame 'has a patented design that fits any latch, anywhere in the world.' 

'One thing that makes Sesame stand out is our unique turning mechanism,' claim the Sesame team on their Kickstarter page.

'Other smart locks requires a point-to-point accuracy at installation to turn properly, meaning the rotation centre of these locks must be placed exactly over the rotation centre of your deadbolt in order for it to work.

'Sesame works area-to-point, allowing it to work under any orientation and installation tolerance, hence the no-tools installation.'

At Mobile World Congress 2014 Qualcomm showed off its vision of the Connected Home where appliances 'talk' to each other using wifi and blutooth

In the home of the future, the front door will ‘talk’ to your smoke alarm, lights will flash when the fridge door is left open and a teddy will put your child to bed.

That’s the vision presented by Qualcomm at Mobile World Congress 2014 in its Connected Home, which shows how almost anything in your house can either be controlled by a mobile, or be linked together electronically.

Other features include the August smart lock that unlocks the front door when the home owner is near, smart TVs that show notifications and can warn when a child is using the web when they should be asleep and a system that lets you change all the clocks in your home at the touch of a button.

All the products in Qualcomm’s concept three-roomed house are sold by individual companies, or have been developed by the California-based firm, but they all run the AllJoyn software. 

AllJoyn is an open source project set up by chipmaker Qualcomm in 2011.

It is a programme that can be added to smart devices to make them ‘talk’ to other devices running AllJoyn.

The company has since partnered with a number of companies that have developed smart household devices to help develop the software further.

It works by letting users set triggers for events. For example, if someone opens the fridge door this triggers an event, such as making smart lights flash, or an alarm to sound.

At the front of Qualcomm’s house was the August smart lock. Fitted to the existing door lock, the battery-powered device is controlled by registered phones or tablets using the August app.

To open the lock, anyone with a code can approach the door, enable their phone's Bluetooth and press the relevant address from the app. The lock takes a few seconds to scan for a paired Bluetooth device. It then confirms the visitor's identity.

The company claim it takes 'literally seconds' to install. 

The app can be taught to recognise you friends by detecting their phone too, so you can let them in when you are out - or alternatively, block people who you don't want coming in.

Sesame can be set up to give you notifications every time your door opens or closes, so you can know exactly who what is going on at home while you are at work.

The system works by using Bluetooth to detect you approaching via your phone, which prompts the smart lock - which fits over your regular deadbolt - to open the door for you.

The project has already reached their target funding of $100,000 (£64,000), but are seeking to raise extra funds to include voice recognition and facial recognition.

Candy House claim to have 'military grade encryption' to stop burglars from hacking the smart lock.

However there are still security concerns. For example, if your phone is stolen or if someone learns your secret knock, your home could be more vulnerable than it would be with a standard lock and key. 

With the optional Wi-Fi addition you can control Sesame when you are away from home, for example to let a friend in. Sesame also provides notifications to your phone every time your door is opened
