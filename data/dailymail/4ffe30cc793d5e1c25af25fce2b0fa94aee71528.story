The adoptive parents
of Baby Veronica are demanding that her biological father and the 
Cherokee Nation pay for all their legal expenses - as it was revealed 
that the four-year old cried out 'I don't want to go' when the time came
for her to be handed over.

The
two-long custody battle between Matt and Melanie Capobianco and 
Veronica's father, Dustin Brown, ended last week when the child was returned to her adoptive parents care after the Oklahoma Supreme 
Court refused to assume jurisdiction.

According
to the Tulsa World, the Capobianco's filed documents in early September 
accusing Brown of 'willful disobedience and complete disregard' for the 
law and as compensation are seeking the recovery of the legal fees and 
expenses from Brown and the Cherokee nation - which could come to 
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Brown
is of Cherokee descent and gained custody of his daughter at the end of
2011 when the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that he had the right 
to claim custody based on the 1978 Indian Child Welfare, which is 
designed to stop Native American children being placed with non-Indian 
adoptive or foster parents.

However,
last Monday, after the U.S. Supreme Court and South Carolina State 
Supreme Court ruled that Veronica be returned to the Capobianco's, she 
was handed over amid emotional and gut-wrenching scenes.

On Wednesday evening, Brown released a statement saying that having Veronica taken was 'more painful than words can describe.'

'Veronica is my child, my flesh and blood, and I love her more than life itself,' Brown said according to ABC News.

'Mommy and Daddy love you and miss you so much.'

Indeed,
in an emotional account of the controversial handover, the Tulsa World 
claims that Dusten Brown and his new wife, Robin, sent her away to the 
Capobianco's with two suitcases, one for her clothes and one for her 
toys.

However, sources close to the handover claim that Veronica was wrenched away exclaiming, 'I don't want to go.'

However,
in the end, Brown is said to have complied with the Oklahoma court 
orders because he didn't want to cross the line into illegality - that 
could have cost him his career in the military.

'I
think, at least in his own mind, he never wanted to do anything 
illegal,' the source said to the Tulsa World. 'That's a line he wouldn't
cross.'

Last Tuesday, the Capobianco family released a statement asking for privacy in a case that has drawn international attention.

'Despite our 
differences, and everything that has happened over the last several 
months, we all love Veronica and want what is best for her,' the family 
said. 'We are all doing well and our focus now is on healing and getting
our life back to normal.'

The custody exchange was made around 
7:30 last Monday night just minutes from the home that Dusten Brown, 
Veronicaâ€™s biological father, was living with his wife Christina 
Maldonado, according to Cherokee County undersheriff Jason Chennault.

Veronica has been living in the Cherokee 
Nation with her father, Dusten Brown, and his family since she was 2 
years old. Before that, she lived with the South Carolina couple who had
taken custody of her shortly after her birth.

Two
South Carolina sheriff's deputies and a state Law Enforcement Division 
agent have arrived in Oklahoma to travel with the family, said Major 
James Brady of the Charleston County Sheriff's office last Tuesday.

by side before a news conference on James Island, South Carolina last 
month in which they appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court to grant them
custody of Baby Veronica

'Obviously,
it's an issue that's created a lot of emotion,' Brady said. 'It helps 
to have deputies on hand to make sure that they get home safely.'

The
Capobiancos had been in Oklahoma for the past month trying to win back 
custody of Veronica. After the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in their 
favor on Monday, Veronica was returned to them by her biological father.

Legal
issues and further potential challenges remain in the case, which 
already has been heard in numerous South Carolina courts and Oklahoma 
district courts, the high courts of both states, Cherokee tribal courts 
and the U.S. Supreme Court.

Veronica's
biological father, Dusten Brown, faces an extradition order to South 
Carolina on charges of custodial interference for refusing to hand over 
Veronica earlier this summer, after her adoption by the Capobiancos was 
finalized.

Brown is due in court October 3rd for a hearing on those charges.

of his daughter

Cherokee
Nation Attorney General Todd Hembree said Brown still has a pending 
appeal asking the state of Oklahoma not to recognize the adoption, and 
attorneys advocating for him met last Tuesday to discuss 'a myriad of 
legal options.'

Brown will ultimately be the one to decide whether to keep fighting for Veronica, Hembree said.

'Dusten
makes those calls about what is in Veronica's best interest,' Hembree 
said. 'It's a situation that no father wants to ever find himself in.'

The
Capobiancos arranged a private adoption of Veronica with her birth 
mother, who is Hispanic, before the child was born in September 2009.

Brown,
who was not married to Veronica's biological mother, signed away his 
parental rights but later said he did not know about the planned 
adoption.

He contested the adoption under
the Indian Child Welfare Act, which aims to prevent the breakup of 
Indian families, and was granted custody of Veronica by a South Carolina
court in 2011.

But the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that the act did not apply in part 
because Brown had not provided support to the birth mother or the child.
South Carolina courts finalized the adoption in July, and Oklahoma 
courts ordered the transfer of Veronica back to her adoptive parents.

The
transfer of the child came hours after the Oklahoma Supreme Court 
lifted a stay on Monday that had kept Veronica in the state, where she 
and Brown were living on tribal land in Tahlequah with relatives.

In a statement late on Monday, Hembree said the hand-over of Veronica was emotional but peaceful.

'Our
hope is that this chapter has ended and both families can move on,' 
said Jennifer Cherock, a spokeswoman for the Capobiancos.
