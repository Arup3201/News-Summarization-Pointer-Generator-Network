Fizzy drinks and high-fat foods are building up a 'ticking time bomb of health problems'

People in their 30s could suffer strokes and dementia because of their junk food diets, scientists claim.

Researchers said a so-called ‘cafeteria diet’ rich in high-calorie, high-sugar and high-salt foods, creates a 'ticking time bomb of health problems'.

This dramatically increases the chance of both falling ill and dying at a younger age.

A trial involving sedentary rats fed a
common junk food diet of biscuits, sausages, cupcakes and sugar-laden 
soft drinks showed they suffered high levels of cholesterol, blood 
sugar, blood pressure and obesity after just two months.

The
animals were at an age roughly equivalent to 16 to 22 years in humans 
at the time of disease onset, according to lead researcher Dr Dale 
Corbett, scientific director of the Heart and Stroke Foundation Centre 
for Stroke Recovery in Ottawa, Canada.

He
said: 'I think we’ll soon start to see people in their 30s or 40s 
having strokes, having dementia, because of this junk food diet. Young 
people will have major, major problems much earlier in life.'

During the laboratory test, the rats had unlimited amounts of nutritional food pellets and common junk food items, but 'greatly preferred' the latter.

Dr Corbett highlights the importance of preventing stroke and heart disease with regular exercise and a balanced diet.

He said: 'If we continue to live and eat like this, then we’re each a ticking time bomb of health problems.'

Dr Mark Bayley, co-chair of the Canadian Stroke Congress and Medical Director of the Neurological Rehabilitation Program in Toronto, said: 'We cannot afford to continue making poor nutritional choices. Our diet is killing us.'

In addition to warning about the health dangers of a poor diet, the study opens the door to further research.

Dr Corbett said: 'Laboratory models often use relatively young animals who are healthier and on better diets than we are.

'However, it is important to remember that for many people, the consequences would be even worse, since a lot of people with stroke also have pre-existing health problems.'

The reseach is published in the journal of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.
