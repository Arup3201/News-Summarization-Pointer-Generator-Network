Roman Abramovich’s daughter Sofia has given the world a unique peek into the world of the Chelsea FC owner and his family.

Sofia, middle child of Abramovich's five offspring with second wife Irina, has uploaded several images of life with her billionaire father on her Instagram account.

As well as the standard stream of selfies, the beautiful 19-year-old equestrian has also posted old family portraits and pictures of her as a child with her businessman father.

Daddy's girl: Teenage Sofia posted this picture of her as a child in her father's arms

Back in the days: Sofia posted this happy family snap of her parents before the divorce and her older siblings Anna and Arkadiy

And, despite her privileged upbringing, rather than bragging about her family's wealth, down-to-earth Sofia prefers posts about baking, horses and her friends.

She has also uploaded a string of old photographs from her childhood, many with her 47-year-old father.

Roman Abramovich, the 50th richest man in the world, divorced her mother Irina in 2007, which saw the former air hostess receive a
 record settlement said to be at least £1billion.

Hashtags galore: As with any other teenage girl, Sofia's Instagram is flooded with selfies

Then and now: Sofia, now 19, compares herself now with an old photograph of her as a child

However, the jaw-dropping divorce 
payout does not seem to have seen his finances suffer too much, as a 
Bloomberg report from April this year estimated Abramovich's net-worth 
to be £8.6billion.

Abramovich then went on to marry Dasha Zhukova, 33, and has since had two more children.

Sofia
 is believed to be residing with Irina on an £18million West Sussex 
estate with her four siblings Ilya, Arina, Arkadiy and Anna.

Humble: The keen equestrian's account is refreshingly free from brags about wealth and luxury, instead Sofia's main focus is her horses

Earlier this summer, Sofia impressed the crowds at the Longines Global Champions Tour at Horse Guards Parade in London.

The
 teenager represented Russia in the show-jumping event of the 
competition with her horses; Zovidius R, which she calls Bugsy on her 
Instagram, and chestnut-coloured Rainbow.

However,
 she was not the only well-to-do heiress to compete in the show. Bruce 
Springsteen’s daughter Jessica, 22, rode for the U.S. and representing 
Greece was Onassis heir Athina Onassis de Miranda, 29.
