Abu Qatada will launch an immediate bid for freedom today.

Within hours of his arrival in his native Jordan, lawyers for the terror suspect said they would file legal papers today asking for him to be released.

Qatada, 53, grinned broadly as he was driven to a maximum-security prison following a two-hour interrogation inside Jordan’s State Security Court.

Radical Islamist cleric Abu Qatada's lawyers said that they will file papers for his immediate release

Surrounded by anti-terrorism officers in a convoy of vehicles which included jeeps mounted with anti-aircraft machine guns, the fundamentalist appeared delighted by his latest legal ploy.

He told his family he was ‘happy’ to be in Jordan, saying: ‘The UK is not my country and I never looked for comfort there. I came back to Jordan on my own wish and I’m happy I’ve come back to my family and loved ones.’ 

Qatada was taken to the State Security Court compound where he was allowed a 15-minute reunion with his father and three brothers. His family left the courthouse proclaiming his innocence and their belief that he would be free within a week.

Mahmoud Othman Omar, the father of Abu Qatada, said that he believes his son is innocent

The family of the radical preacher, centre, leave the Jordanian military court. A Jordanian military prosecutor says he has charged a radical Muslim preacher with conspiring to carry out al-Qaida-linked attacks on Americans, Israelis and other Westerners

Father Mahmoud Othman, 84, said: ‘My son is innocent and I hope the court will set him free. They are going to release him on bail after a week. He is in high spirits.’ 

Brother Ibrahim, 33, a falafel seller, added: ‘We hope he’ll be out in a week.’ 

Witnesses said Qatada started crying when he saw his father for the first time in 22 years, and knelt to kiss his hands and feet. His brother Mohammed seized him and kissed his hand, swearing allegiance to him as his ‘Sheikh’, or leader.

Qatada spent last night in a Jordanian prison, deep in the desert – a world away from his family’s taxpayer-funded four-bedroom home in the suburbs of north-west London.

Prosecutors said they expected the radical Islamist to remain at the maximum-security Muwaqqar prison for at least two weeks while he undergoes daily interrogation from lawyers and the prosecutor-general.

On yer bike: Abu Qatada is finally being deported after a 10-year legal battle that has cost taxpayers around £2million

He is accused of plotting Al Qaeda-linked terrorist bomb attacks on Western and Israeli targets in Jordan in the 1990s.

Prison insiders said any contact with other inmates would be tightly controlled for fear the extremist cleric would inspire a new generation of terrorists. 

Qatada’s lawyer Tayseer Daib said: ‘I will appeal tomorrow to the court to release him on bail. My client is not guilty.’ 

If he gets bail, he would live in his parents’ home in downtown Amman, near the family’s falafel restaurant.

Abu Qatada has finally been deported from Britain after a 10-year legal battle that has cost taxpayers an estimated £2million. Qatada's plane left the airfield at about 2.45am

The Government has been trying to deport him to Jordan, where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999, for about a decade

The 53-year-old hate preacher left Belmarsh prison shortly after midnight on Sunday morning in a police convoy. He was taken to RAF Northholt, from where he was flown in a private jet to Jordan

Meanwhile, his wife and five children are to stay in their £1,400-a-month London home  to the fury of neighbours.

The preacher’s family have received an estimated £500,000 in benefits since they arrived in the country in 1993.

Neighbours have started a petition demanding the family is evicted, and have threatened to stop paying council tax. 

One resident said yesterday: ‘They should have different areas for people like this to go to, instead of putting them in residential areas like this.’
