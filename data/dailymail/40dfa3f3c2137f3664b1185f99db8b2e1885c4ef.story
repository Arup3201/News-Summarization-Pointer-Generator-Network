Paul Scholes fears Danny Welbeck could come back to haunt Manchester United  on Saturday.

The Arsenal and England star was deemed surplus to requirements by Louis van Gaal in the summer and sold to their Premier League rivals.

United could leapfrog the Gunners in the table with victory at Old Trafford, but former Red Devil Scholes fears the worst.  

Danny Welbeck has enjoyed a storming start to the season for his new club and country

Welbeck has scored 10 goals in 21 games so far this campaign for Arsenal and England

'In terms of United, they miss the energy that Danny once gave them in attack,' Scholes said in the Evening Standard. 

'My view has not changed: he should not have been sold and recently I have felt that United have looked a bit pedestrian going forward. As a United fan I am a little concerned for them going into Saturday’s game.

'Aside from Michael Carrick at his very best, United lack a central midfielder capable of linking play and getting the best out of their forwards.

'They need that individual who can pass the ball forward, play one-twos and bring the strikers into the game. That kind of playmaker – a Cesc Fabregas, Luka Modric or Toni Kroos – is vital to any side. They are the brains of the team and without them the forwards can struggle.

'Much will be made of Danny Welbeck’s first game against the club at which he grew up. The immediate assumption will be that Danny is nurturing some grievance against United at being sold and will want to prove a point. 

'I don’t see it that way. Danny will want to play well because he would want to anyway, regardless of the opposition, and from what I see and hear he is very happy at Arsenal and with his move to London.'
