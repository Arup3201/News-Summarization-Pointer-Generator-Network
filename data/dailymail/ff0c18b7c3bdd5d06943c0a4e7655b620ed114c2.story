A marine who gallantly dropped back in a race to help a nine-year-old boy finish has become an internet sensation.

Lance Corporal Myles Kerr was competing in the annual run while home on leave in Charlevoix, Michigan when he spotted Boden Fuchs struggling to keep up.

The boy reportedly asked 19-year-old Kerr: 'Sir, will you please run with me?', after losing the group he was running with.

The race results show that after allowing his fellow marines to run off at full speed in the race along the shore of Lake Michigan, Kerr finished five seconds behind Fuchs at 34.53 minutes - and a long way behind his army friends.

The picture of Kerr running with the boy in his army fatigues, encouraging him all the way to the finish line has already had 200,000 likes on Facebook and been shared 45,000 times.

Facebook users were full of praise for the Lance Corporal, calling him 'a role model' and a 'hero'.

Becoming a local celebrity, Kerr was interview by local radio stations and newspapers.
