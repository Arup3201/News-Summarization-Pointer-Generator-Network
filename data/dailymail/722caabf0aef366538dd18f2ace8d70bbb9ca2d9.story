When Gary James went to see his Jack Russell in the front garden, he panicked after realising it had escaped through an open gate.

The father-of-three frantically searched for his beloved dog, but his neighbour, Gavin Juliette, quickly informed them the pet already been found - trapped in the engine of his car.

The 42-year-old had driven 12 miles in his Audi A4 from Ordsall to Swinton in Greater Manchester to pick up his mother-in-law while the dog, called Betty Boop, was stuck under the bonnet.

Stuck: The Jack Russell, called Betty Boop, was wedged between the pipework under the bonnet of the Audi A4

Panic: Gary James, 33, went to search for the dog when he realised he had left the garden gate open

It had managed to find a plastic shelf to sit on for the duration of the journey, but became wedged in the pipework.

After Mr Juliette heard barking coming from his car, he called over Mr James for help.

The pair took apart the engine as the cowering dog stared back at them, and they managed to rescue it virtually unscathed.

Mr James said: 'We just couldn’t believe what had happened and it was even harder to believe how she'd survived.

'It’s a good job Gavin wasn’t going to Blackpool or he’d have probably ended up with a hot dog.

'When I first saw her in there I thought she was bound to be injured or badly burned - but, apart from being covered in oil and a bit shaky, she was fine.

'Now she’s completely back to normal and playing with the children as if nothing happened. I’ll definitely be keeping the front gate locked from now on.'

Help: He had to take apart the car's engine when he noticed his beloved dog was trapped in pipework under the bonet

Safe: Mr James, a cleaning manager, managed to retrieve the dog virtually unscathed

Mr Juliette, who made the trip with his wife and son, said: 'All we could hear when we got back was this yapping.

'We thought it was coming from the garden but then I put my ear to the bonnet.

'I opened it and the little fella was just there glaring back at me, I couldn’t believe it.

'It’s not the smallest dog and I still can’t quite work out how it managed to get itself there. It’s absolutely bizarre.

'I still don’t get how it survived, with the heat in there and the fan spinning, but I’m just glad for Gary and his family it was a happy ending.'
