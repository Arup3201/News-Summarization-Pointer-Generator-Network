Edinson Cavani will not stay at PSG long-term, according to club legend Jerome Rothen.

Rothen, who made 139 appearances for the Parisian club, claimed that although Cavani could have a future with the French champions, he will always struggle in a team dominated by Zlatan Ibrahimovic.  

'He (Cavani) can still succeed in Paris, but his performances will be more or less the same. Everything depends on the tactical choices of Laurent Blanc. However, I can't see him staying long-term in Paris,' Rothen told Le 10 Sport .

The 27-year-old forward joined the French Champions from Napoli in the summer of 2013 for £55m 

Cavani joined PSG from Napoli in 2013 for a staggering £55million, but Rothen feels the Uruguayan has failed to live up to his billing.

'If he reiterates his desire to leave, the club will not keep him,' he said. 'Especially if he has the same performances as last year - the directors won't necessarily be satisfied.

'If Cavani considers himself a star in the team, it could be a concern because, in Paris, it's Zlatan and then the rest. They must deal with Zlatan, who is a player beyond the norm.

'For me, Cavani is not among the great attackers, like Ibra, Messi or Ronaldo. He's a player who needs others and will not decide something with a bit of class, an individual moment.'
