Jose Mourinho launched a furious attack on referee Anthony Taylor and claimed there is a campaign to brand his Chelsea team ‘cheats’ after their 1-1 draw at Southampton.

The Chelsea boss told Taylor he should be ‘ashamed’ of his performance after he failed to award Cesc Fabregas a penalty when he appeared to be fouled by Saints left back Matt Targett.

Mourinho said: ‘The reality is that there are penalties and there are penalties - this was one was big, like Big Ben.

The Chelsea manager says there is a 'campaign' against his side after Fabregas was denied a penalty

‘Referees are not here to guess, they are there to see. He assumed dishonest with Cesc and he is wrong. 

‘Match after match coaches are saying Chelsea players are diving. Out of nothing Sam Allardyce starts talking about my players.

‘I will go to the referee, wish him a good year and tell him he will be ashamed. There is a campaign against Chelsea. 

‘In other countries where I worked before, tomorrow in the sports papers it would be front-page scandal because it is a scandal.

‘In this country - and I am happy with that, more than happy with that - we will just say that it was a big mistake with a big influence in the result.

‘I am happy that it is this way, with respect for the referee. He made a big mistake like I make, like the players make sometimes.’

Fabregas was cautioned for simulation and Mourinho also made the valid point that there should be a device for referees to rescind yellow cards if they later accept they made a mistake.

The Chelsea manager added: ‘The double punishment is something unbelievable. Anthony could go to a screen, sees a mistake and cleans the yellow card. It should be a simple process.’ 

Mourinho claims opposing managers are deliberately attempting to sabotage his team’s title ambitions by repeatedly accusing Chelsea of being divers.

Diego Costa, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic, Willian and now Fabregas have all been accused of diving this season.

Mourinho added: ‘They are not incidents, they are not incidents - that’s a campaign, that's a campaign. That's a clear campaign.

‘People, pundits, commentators, coaches from other teams - they react with Chelsea in a way they don't react to other teams.

‘You know the most crucial things over the last two weeks are not the cards? It is Filipe Luis and Eden Hazard because they could be in hospital with broken legs.

‘You speak about Gary Cahill and the same with Hull? Well what about Crystal Palace’s goal at Manchester City being disallowed?

‘After we beat West Ham 2-0, a game that should gave been four or five, Enner Valencia made a bad dive and Sam was talking about Ivanovic.

‘Against Southampton it was a crucial decision. The referee has made a mistake.’

Jose Mourinho is clearly unhappy with the decision after seeing one of his players booked for simulation 

Despite Chelsea’s slip, Southampton easily deserved a point after Saido Mane put Ronald Koeman’s team into an early lead.

They remain fourth in the Barclays Premier League ahead of Arsenal and Koeman said: ‘I am proud the organisation and the spirit. One point against Chelsea is maybe three against another team.

‘The difference was that we played until the last second, we showed the spirit, it was unbelievable. ‘We didn’t make stupid mistakes, as we did against Manchester United and Manchester City.

‘The second half against Chelsea was difficult, but we were organised and disciplined. We scored a great goal.

‘I didn’t really see the penalty incident, but maybe it is a penalty I don’t know, I would have to see it again. 

‘If the referees thing it is simulation, then he always has that decision to make. ‘Is it simulation or is it fault? Honestly I would have to see that moment again.’
