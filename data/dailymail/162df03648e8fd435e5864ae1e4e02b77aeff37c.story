Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert has warned Christian Benteke he may again find himself warming the bench in Tuesday night's crunch six-pointer at Hull.

Benteke, 24, was axed from Villa’s starting line for Saturday’s 2-1 defeat against Chelsea after scoring just two Premier League goals since returning from injury in October.

Lambert instead selected Gabby Agbonlahor to lead the line against Jose Mourinho’s side and hinted he is likely to stick with the same attack against the Tigers as his team aim for a first league win in 10 attempts.

And Lambert has demanded the Belgian, who was used as a second-half substitute at the weekend, raises his game.

‘Listen, he (Benteke) was good about it,’ Lambert said. ‘It wasn’t a hard decision. That is football management. I expect to get a reaction from him.’

He added: 'It wasn't a hard decision. The decision to leave him out wasn't any harder than to leave anybody else out.

'That is football management. I expect to get a reaction from him. I think it would help him, it gives him that little bit of respite from it.

'Christian, by his own admission, knows himself he hasn't been playing well, but you need to protect him as well. He has only been in this country three years.

'The first year he was excellent, the second year he had a bad injury and he is just getting back to playing the game again. It is a normal reaction.'

The Villa boss also revealed he and Mourinho didn’t speak after Saturday’s feisty clash.

The pair have been involved in a series of spats and Mourinho appeared to stoke the fires further after the game when he suggested that if Villa ‘go down it is not because of the quality of their players’.

‘I know the way he meant it,’ Lambert added. ‘I will let Mr Mourinho have his view. We were passing ships after the game. I never saw him.’
