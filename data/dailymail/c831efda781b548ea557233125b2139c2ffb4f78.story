ET could be closer than you think.

Research suggests the galaxy is teeming with life – and the nearest habitable world is near enough to see with the naked eye.

This other world is just one of around 40 billion ‘Earths’ in the Milky Way.

Researcher Andrew Howard said: ‘Potential sites for life to get started are abundant in the galaxy.

One in five stars similar to the sun is circled by an Earth-like planet that might be habitable, scientists believe. This graphic shows something scientists call the 'habitable zone' where the planet's orbit is not too far from the star such that water freezes, and not too close such that water vapourises

‘We still don’t know how easily life can spring forth on a potentially habitable planet but with 40 billion chances, I’m optimistic that we’re not alone.’

The US team used data collected by Nasa’s Kepler telescope, which took photographs of 150,000 stars every 30 minutes for four years.

These images were then analysed for small but regular dips in the star’s light – a telltale sign that a planet is passing in front of it.

Some 42,000 of the stars monitored were like the sun or slightly cooler and these had 603 planets orbiting them.

The data was collected from Kepler which conducted a massive search for planets beyond our solar system. It detected the tiny dip in brightness that occurs when an orbiting object crosses, or 'transits', in front of a star

The Kepler spacecraft observed 150,000 stars within a field in the constellation Cygnus. Kepler, now crippled and its four-year mission at an end, was able to provide enough data to complete its mission objective: to determine how many of the 100 billion stars in our galaxy have potentially habitable planets

The hunt is on for planets about the size of Earth that orbit at just the right distance from their star - in a region termed the habitable zone.

The habitable zone is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water -- an essential ingredient for life as we know it -- to pool on a planet's surface.

To determine the location of a star's habitable zone, scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits.

Knowing precisely how far away a habitable zone needs to be from a star also depends on chemistry.

For example, molecules in a planet's atmosphere will absorb a certain amount of energy from starlight and radiate the rest back out.

How much of this energy is trapped can mean the difference between a turquoise sea and erupting volcanoes.

Ten
of these were Earth-like, that is, roughly the size of our planet and 
just the right distance from their star for it to be neither too hot or 
too cold for life to survive.

After accounting for holes in the data, they estimated that 22 per cent of all sun-like stars are circled by a planet that could be suitable for life.

Many are much larger than the Earth, or follow orbits so close to their parent stars that their surfaces would be roasted.

But some are roughly Earth-size and lie in the 'habitable' or 'Goldilocks' zone - the orbital band close enough to a star for temperatures to be just right for life.

By definition, habitable zone temperatures are mild enough to allow oceans and lakes of liquid water.

In a galaxy of 200 billion stars of various types, this works out at 11 billion planets.

But factor smaller, dimmer red dwarf stars, and the number of planets with mild temperatures similar to Earth  rises to 40 billion.

Kepler, which cost £395 million, was launched in March 2009 with the chief aim of searching for Earth-sized planets that might support life.

Kepler used something known as the 'transit method' to detect extrasolar planets.

A transit occurs when a planet crosses in front of its star as viewed by an observer.

Transits by terrestrial planets produce a small change in a star's brightness lasting for one to 16 hours.

Scientists believe this change must be periodic if it is caused by a planet.

They
also claim that all transits produced by the same planet must be of the
same change in brightness and last the same amount of time.

Once
Kepler detected a pattern such as this, scientists could calculate the 
planet's orbital size from how long it took for the planet to orbit once
around the star.

The size of the planet is found from how much the brightness of the star drops as well as the star's size.

From the orbital size and the temperature of the star, the planet's characteristic temperature can be calculated.

Knowing the temperature of a planet is key to whether or not the planet is habitable.

Dr Howard, of the University of Hawaii, said: ‘Our galaxy has 40 billion chances for life to get started and evolve.

‘Today, more than ever we need to focus on searching for intelligent life.’

However, not all of the temperate planets will be able to harbour life.

Researcher Geoffrey Marcy (CORR), of the University of California, Berkeley, said: ‘Some may have thick atmospheres, making it so hot at the surface that DNA-like molecules would not survive.

‘Others may have rocky surfaces that could harbour liquid water suitable for living organisms.’

He added: 'The primary goal of the Kepler mission was to answer the question, when you look up in the night sky, what fraction of the stars that you see have Earth-size planets at lukewarm temperatures so that water would not be frozen into ice or vapourised into steam, but remain a liquid, because liquid water is now understood to be the prerequisite for life.

'Until now, no one knew exactly how common potentially habitable planets were around Sun-like stars in the galaxy.'

Colleague Erik (CORR) Petigura, who led the analysis, said: ‘What this means is, when you look up at the thousands of stars in the night sky, the nearest sun-like star with an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone is probably only 12 light years away and can be seen with the naked eye.

‘That is amazing.’

Dr Subhanjoy Mohanty, an Imperial College London astrophysicist, said the study ‘certainly increases the chances’ that we are not alone.

He added: ‘This is an added impetus for planned future missions which will study the atmospheres of these potentially habitable planets, enabling us to investigate whether they are in fact habitable or not and also whether their atmospheres show actual biosignatures of existing life.’

Last week, scientists analysing data from the Kepler probe found that a small hot planet orbiting a star 700 light years away bears striking similarities to Earth.

The planet, named Kepler 78b, is the smallest exoplanet whose mass and size are known. It is just 1.2 times bigger than Earth, 1.7 times more massive, and has an almost identical density.

Scientists believe that, like the Earth, Kepler 78b mostly consists of rock and iron. There the similarities end, however.

The planet hugs its parent star so closely that nothing could live on its scorching surface. Kepler 78b's year is just 8.5 hours long - the length of time it takes to complete one orbit round its star.

'It's Earth-like in the sense that it's about the same size and mass, but of course it's extremely unlike the Earth in that it's at least 2,000 degrees hotter,' said Dr Josh Winn, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US, who took part in the research published in the journal Nature.

'It's a step along the way of studying truly Earth-like planets.'
