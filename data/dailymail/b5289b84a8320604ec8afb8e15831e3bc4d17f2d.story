Joshua Waddington, 21, started a brawl at his sister's wedding, after attacking a couple who were on a romantic break at the same venue

A wedding at a historic country hotel descended into chaos after the groom and his new brother-in-law started a fight with a couple who were staying at the same venue.

Jessica Franklin and her husband Ian were celebrating their marriage with friends and family at Bosworth Hall Hotel, Leicestershire, in December last year when the brawl broke out.

The drama unfolded after the bride's 21-year-old brother Joshua Waddingham launched an attack on Rebecca Rankin and her fiancé Paul Gurney, who were enjoying a romantic mini-break at the same Grade II listed hotel.

Leicester Crown Court heard how the bride desperately tried to pull her loved ones from the brawl as Waddingham and Franklin, 31, began assaulting Mr Gurney.

Wedding guests James Sharman, 27, and his 21-year-old wife, Chloe, also joined in with the attack. 

The court heard how, as the group beat Mr Gurney, Ms Rankin stepped in to protect her fiancé.

But Ms Rankin was hit twice by Waddingham, who later kicked her in the head as she fell to the ground.

She suffered a bloody nose and black eyes while Mr Gurney sustained a broken ankle, which required two operations. He was unable to walk for six weeks.

Waddingham, said to have taken the lead in the attack, was given a two-year jail sentence, suspended for two years.

He admitted causing grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm when he appeared at Leicester Crown Court.

He was also given 200 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay £1,000 compensation to Mr Gurney and £250 to Ms Rankin.

Judge Nicholas Dean QC said: 'This was an utterly disgraceful episode on what should have been a day of happiness for everyone involved.'

Prosecutor Sarah Lloyd told the court how the 'atmosphere changed' in the bar of the 17th-century hotel when the victims had a disagreement with wedding guests.

Mr Gurney suffered a cut ear in a minor tussle in the toilets before trouble brewed again. He threw a table, which did not hit anyone, 'to protect himself', the court was told.

Miss Lloyd said: 'Waddingham punched at Paul Gurney, who fell to the floor. Ian Franklin and James Sharman became involved, kicking and punching him to his head and body as he lay on the floor.' 

Ms Rankin then intervened in the scuffle, shouting, 'Are you going to hit me now?', the court heard.

Miss Lloyd said: 'Waddingham punched her at least twice to the face in quick succession, causing her to fall, where he hit her again and kicked her head.

'As both complainants were laid out on the floor, Chloe Sharman kicked in the direction of their heads on three occasions as the bride attempted to pull the defendants away.'

The three men admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Gurney, while Ms Sharman admitted affray.

Franklin and James Sharman were both given 12-month jail sentences, suspended for two years, with 150 hours of unpaid work. Each must pay £750 compensation to Mr Gurney.

Chloe Sharman was sentenced to a 12-month community order with 100 hours of unpaid work.

Judge Dean said to the defendants: 'It may be Mr Gurney and, to an extent, Miss Rankin contributed to what happened, but to a much lesser extent than you.'

Gareth Weetman, mitigating for Waddingham, said: 'He's genuinely ashamed. It's unclear who started the second flashpoint - there was aggression on both sides.'

Rachel Darby, for Franklin, said: 'It was a combination of drink and emotion. He had a natural desire to protect his wife on her wedding day.'

Bosworth Hall Hotel and Spa is set in the Warwickshire countryside and dates back from the 17th century. The Grade II listed building is set in landscaped gardens, and its luxurious rooms can fetch hundreds of pounds a night
