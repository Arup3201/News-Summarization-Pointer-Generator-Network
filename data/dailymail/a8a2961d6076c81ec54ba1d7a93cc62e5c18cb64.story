Blessed with children as well as a career outside the home, working mums may seem to have it all.

But actually they suffer a double guilt burden – that they are bad mothers because they work and bad employees because they have a family, a study shows.

Researchers found that working mothers agonised more about their job outside the office than fathers and had more negative thoughts about their family while at work.

Guilt: Mother-of-four Victoria Beckham (with husband David and sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn) admitted to Vogue last year that she feels 'guilty' every time she goes out to work

Both parents think about their 
families, but only for mothers is this type of thought associated with 
increased stress and negative emotions.

Shira
 Offer, an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology and 
Anthropology at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, studied mental labour in 
working parents in pressurised jobs.

She
 defines the term as thoughts and concerns that can impair performance, 
make it difficult to focus on tasks, and even hurt our sleep.

The
 study, presented to the American Sociological Association, relies on data 
from the 500 Family Study, which investigates how 
middle-class families balance family and work experiences.

The
 study looked at 402 American mothers and 291 fathers in dual-earner 
families who completed a survey and a time and emotions diary.

Asst
 Professor Offer found that working mothers engaged in mental labour in about
 one fourth of their waking time.

Working fathers spent one fifth of their working time engaged in it.

This amounts to approximately 29 and 24 hours per week of mental labour for mothers and fathers, respectively.

Working guilt: Sarah Jessica Parker starred in the film 'I Don't Know How She Does It', playing ever-juggling working mother Kate Reddy

However,
 mothers and fathers both spent about 30 percent of the time they were 
engaged in mental labour thinking about family matters.

Last year, Victoria Beckham spoke of her guilt of going out to work. Mrs Beckham - mother to Brooklyn, 14, Romeo, 11, Cruz, eight, and Harper, two, - admitted balancing her parenting duties with managing her clothing empire leaves her feeling 'constantly guilty'.

Speaking at London's Vogue Festival, the 39-year-old, said: 'I think you feel so torn, don't you? But I've got great people who handle my schedule and everything does revolve around the children.'

Commenting on her research, Asst
 Professor Offer said: 'What my research actually shows is that gender differences in 
mental labour are more a matter of quality than quantity.

'I assume that because mothers
 bear the major responsibility for childcare and family life, when they 
think about family matters, they tend to think about the less pleasant 
aspects of it and are more likely to be worried.'

Asst
 Prof Offer added: 'We know that mothers are the ones who usually adjust
 their work schedule to meet family demands, such as staying home with a
 sick child.

'Desperate to be with her': Daybreak presenter Lorraine Kelly said last year that she 'suffered terribly from working mother guilt'

'Therefore,
 mothers may feel that they do not devote enough time to their job and 
have to ‘catch up,’ and, as a result, they are easily preoccupied with 
job-related matters outside the workplace.

'This illustrates the double burden, the pressure to be "good" mothers and "good" workers, that working mums experience.

'I thought that highly educated fathers holding professional and managerial positions would often be preoccupied with job matters when doing things such as housework or during their free time.

'It appears, however, that fathers are quite adept at leaving their work concerns behind and are better able to draw boundaries between work and home.

'I believe that fathers can afford to do that because someone else, namely their spouse, assumes the major responsibility for the household and childcare.'

She added: 'It is true that fathers today are more involved in childrearing and do more housework than in previous generations, but the major responsibility for the domestic realm continues to disproportionately fall on mothers’ shoulders and this has to change.'

Mothers agonise more about their job outside work hours than fathers

They also worry more about family life while at work, say Israeli researchers

This may be because fathers know their partner will worry on their behalf
