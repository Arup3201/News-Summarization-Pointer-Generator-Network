A couple who welcomed quintuplets on top of four children last September have revealed that they go through 40 bottles and more than 100 diapers each day.

Evonne and Deon Derrico from Las Vegas told the Today show that their new babies - Deniko, Dariz, Deonee, Daician and Daiten - need feeding every three hours and changing constantly.

'You change them and then you finish and go to the next one and then you realize the one you just changed did it all over again,' 33-year-old mother-of-nine, Mrs Derrico, said.

Quite a handful:  Evonne and Deon Derrico, who welcomed quintuplets on top of four children last September, have revealed that they go through 40 bottles and more than 100 diapers each day

With such a large brood, a family outing can prove quite a challenge.

Indeed, to go to a Thanksgiving lunch last November the Derricos had to pack the night before to make sure they had everything.

But once they were ready to leave home they realized they had forgotten one thing; their own shoes.

Full-time job: The four-month-old babies - Deniko, Dariz, Deonee, Daician and Daiten - need feeding every three hours and changing constantly

'You change them and then you finish and go to the next one and then you realize the one you just changed did it all over again,' 33-year-old mother-of-nine, Mrs Derrico, said

'Neither one of us had shoes on - just socks,' Mr Derrico said breaking a smile.

He and his wife already had a seven-year-old daughter, Dai, a three-year-old son, Deon, and 
one-year-old twin boys, Dallas and Denver. when they learned five 
more babies were on the way.

'We wouldn't have been that shocked to have had twins again, but we could have never expected quintuplets'

Although multiple births are rare, the Derricos said that they did not use fertility drugs to conceive.

'We wouldn't have been that shocked to have had twins again, but we could have never expected this,' Mr Derrico exclaimed at the time.

At
 22 weeks of pregnancy, after discovering they were expecting 
quintuplets, the family moved to suburban Phoenix for care from Dr. John
 Elliott, a perinatologist and multiple-birth specialist.

Joy: The couple, pictured with three-year-old Deon and one-year-old twins Dallas and Denver, looked surprisingly relaxed as they said everyone is getting enough sleep and they are sticking to a schedule

Finding enough space: The family had to make many readjustments following the birth of their five children, which included changing the layout of their home

After spending her last trimester on bed rest, Mrs Derrico gave birth at 32 weeks - and her family almost doubled in less than five minutes.

Each baby was delivered between 11.17am and 11.21am on Friday, September 6, weighing less than three pounds.

The Derricos did not know the babies'
 genders prior to birth and the midwife announced 
'boy' or 'girl' as each baby was presented in the delivery room.

Making his entrance: Deniko was the first of the
 quintuplets to arrive at 11.17am on Friday September 6

Tiny tot: Dariz was the next boy to arrive one minute later - all weighed less than three pounds at birth

Here come the girls: Deonee was the first sister born at 11:19am - their genders were not known prior to birth

Give me five: Daician was the next girl to be born, one minute after Deonee

Under
 surveillance: Daiten was the last of the 
quintuplets to be born at 11:21am - and although she has put on a pound 
since she was born, she is expected to return home in about two weeks

In keeping with the Derrico family tradition, their names all start with the letter 'D'.

For the first few weeks of their lives they were monitored in the neonatal intensive care unit.

Then once doctors had deemed them well enough to be released, they gradually returned home.

After the births, the Derricos told the Las Vegas Sun that they had to make several adjustments which included getting a larger car and changing the layout of their home..

Their quintuplets were the fifth set of out-of-state quints delivered at Banner Desert Hospital in the past year.

Growing: Deon and Evonne Derrico with their 
four children, Dallas, Denver, Deon and Dai, before the quintuplets

Mrs Derrico said it was always her dream to have a big family.

'This is just a blessing from God. It really is. It's a dream come true.'

Now she and her husband's biggest concern is giving the right amount of attention to everyone.

'I don't want any of them to grow up thinking they didn't get enough love,' Mr Derrico said.
