The Duchess of Cambridge’s family business could be in breach of strict advertising laws covering the London Olympics after bringing out a range of goods to cash in on the Games.

It is a criminal offence to capitalise commercially on the back of 2012 unless you are an official sponsor. Flouting the law could result in court action and a £20,000 fine.

Yet the Middleton family business, Party Pieces, is advertising on its website a huge range of goods under the headline Celebrate The Games, including Celebrate London bunting and balloons, a ring toss game in the Olympic colours, and multi-country flag banners.

The Celebrate the Games activity sets include a £2.49 ring toss game and £1.99 paper chains in the Olympic colours of red, yellow, green, blue and black

Kate’s sister Pippa, who writes an accompanying blog called The Party Times, is also taking a risk with a piece entitled Celebrate The Games And Support Team GB which provides links to many of the items on sale.

And although the firm is careful to avoid the most blatant breach of the stringent code – mentioning the actual word ‘Olympics’ – if you put Olympics into Party Pieces’ own search engine it takes you to their Celebrate The Games page, which could still be grounds for action.

The regulations have been brought in by Locog, the London 2012 organising committee, and are enforceable under a 2006 law drawn up to protect Olympic branding.

Locog has drawn up an inventory of banned words and can take action against anyone using two or more words from what it calls List A: Games, Two Thousand and Twelve, 2012 and Twenty-Twelve.

It can also prosecute anyone who uses a word from List A and joins it with one or more words from List B which includes: London, medals, sponsors, summer, gold, silver and bronze.

Its official brand protection guide says even expressions such as ‘Backing the 2012 Games’ and ‘Supporting the London Games’ are infringements of their legal rights.

   Party Pieces, which is run by Kate’s mother Carole, is selling more than 100 items under its Celebrate The Games banner, ranging from 99p to £19.99 in price.

The heading includes a logo featuring the words Let The Games Begin in the Olympic colours, a woman athlete throwing a javelin and a Union Jack-covered torch.

Among the items for sale are packs of £1.99 paper chains in the Olympic colours of red, yellow, green, blue and black. For £2.49 you can also snap up a pair of ‘hilarious’ novelty 2012 Union Jack-covered sunglasses or for £7.99 an inflatable beer mug drinks holder.

The site also boasts a range of Celebrate The Games activity sets including a £2.49 ring toss game in which players attempt to throw hoops in the Olympic colours over an upright plastic stick.

There is even a £12.99 ‘stadium scene setter’ – a banner that can be hung from the walls of your home to create your own Olympic stadium.

The Olympic Delivery Authority has declined to comment on individual cases. But it is understood that most businesses will receive a letter warning them to take down the offending advertising at first.Party Pieces was unavailable for comment last night.

Party Pieces is based in a warehouse near the Middletons’ £1million Berkshire home and employs about a dozen staff.

It sells party bags, fancy dress costumes and games for children’s birthday parties and special occasions from Christmas to Chinese New Year.

The firm attracted unwelcome publicity in March 2010 when it published an interview with Kate – then an employee – discussing her tips for the perfect party, alongside a photo.

It was swiftly removed after critics pointed out that she had just won damages from a photographic agency for breach of privacy. The website also raised eyebrows with its princess-themed section, though it pre-dates the engagement.

Mrs Middleton, 57, a former air hostess, set up Party Pieces in 1987. Her husband, a former British Airways flight dispatcher, helps to run it. Kate worked as a photographer and web designer for the firm for three years until Christmas.

Her sister Pippa runs Party Times, an online magazine for her parents’ company which featured in a newspaper magazine two weeks before the engagement. And her brother James, 23, promotes his cake-making business on the website.

The finances of Party Pieces are unclear because it trades as a partnership rather than being registered as a company, which would entail lodging accounts with Companies House. But it is thought to have made millions of pounds for the family.

And it is not the first time that the Middletons have been accused of unofficially cashing in on events - and their daughters royal connections.

In the build up to the Royal Wedding they produced a range of themed items including corgi cake toppers and plastic hats emblazoned with Union Flags.

They even launched a pack of Britannia scratch cards on British trivia.

And they were accused by Britain's Got Talent of illegally carrying its logo on their website.
