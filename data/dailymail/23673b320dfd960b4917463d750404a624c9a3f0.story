Mother with private healthcare plans are twice as likely to have a pre-planned c-section than those who give birth using an NHS hospital

Well-off mothers really are 'too posh to push', according to new figures which show pregnant women who have private healthcare plans are twice as likely to have a pre-planned Caesarean section.

A study has found that 21 per cent of private patients have a scheduled C-section compared to just 8.9 per cent of publicly funded ones.

Researchers examined 30,000 women who gave birth at a hospital in Ireland which caters for both private and public-funded patients between 2008 and 2011. Around one in five of the women paid for their treatment themselves.

The research, published in the journal BMJ Open, found that, overall, 34.4 per cent of privately paying mothers had a C-section, compared to 22.5 per cent of public patients.

The 'greatest disparity' noted between the mothers was the rates of scheduled C-sections, the study found.

For first-time mothers, 11.9 per cent of private patients had pre-planned surgery compared to just 4.6 per cent of those whose care was paid for by the public purse.

'We found that private patients are more likely than public patients to have an operative vaginal delivery or a Caesarean section.'

The difference was particularly great among women who had given birth 
before by C-section, while private patients were also more likely to 
have a surgical vaginal delivery using a vacuum or forceps.

It may be that older, better educated women are more strongly influenced
 by the choices obstetricians would make for themselves, or that their 
own preferences more closely mirror these views.

The authors said: 'There are several 
studies reporting strong personal preferences among some obstetricians 
for scheduled caesarean section, and indeed many of the private patients
 were health professionals.'

But they said that it was not 
possible to determine whether the decision to give birth via C-section 
was driven by the expectant mother or the doctors caring for them.

Caesarean section carries a certain 
amount of risk - such as the wound becoming infected or the baby 
developing breathing difficulties. It also takes longer to recover than 
after a vaginal birth.

The researches wrote: 'Although speculative, it 
seems quite likely that private patients are provided with greater 
choice in relation to a scheduled caesarean section. It is debatable 
whether this is actually in the womanâ€™s best interest, particularly when
 it comes to the next birth.

The Royal College of Midwives said the study highlights the need to avoid 'unnecessary' Caesarean sections

'What does need to be addressed is 
whether higher rates of scheduled caesarean sections among private 
patients create access issues for medically indicated caesarean 
sections, and whether these patients place a disproportionate burden on 
the service in the postoperative period.'

The Royal College of Midwives said the study highlights the need to avoid 'unnecessary' Caesarean sections.

Janine Stockdale, research fellow at the RCM, said: 'This is interesting research that may throw a spotlight on the high rates of Caesarean sections that we are seeing in Western Europe including the UK, a number that we would like to see falling.

'The findings also underline the need to avoid unnecessary Caesarean sections as this is a major surgical operation, that has the potential for increased complications every time a woman has the procedure carried out.

'The RCM therefore supports National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines which encourage women to have a thorough discussion with their obstetricians and midwives about the implications of having a Caesarean section, especially in circumstances where other options remain open to them.'
