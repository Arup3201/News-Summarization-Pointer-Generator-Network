A care home owner under police investigation after a 99-year-old woman was allegedly dropped into a bath of scalding water has told residents they have just 14 days to move out.

Peter Pumbien of the Briarwood Rest Home in Preston has told Lancashire County Council's social services team that they have two weeks to rehouse the residents.

Mr Pumbien said: 'I have decided to close the home and given social services notice. The residents have 14 days to move out. I have nothing else to say on this matter.'

The home, which charges up to Â£405 a week, has a capacity of 24 residents and has been run for the past 12 years by Mr Pumbien and his wife Indrannee.

According to the Sun visiting nurse discovered an elderly man being force fed and reported the matter. A follow-up investigation found that 99-year-old Margaret Wheatley had been left with serious burns after being placed into a scalding bath.

A 94-year-old female resident was said to have suffered two black eyes and a bruised arm.

Mr Pubien refused to comment further on the investigation claiming he had 'nothing else to say'.

According to The Sun, Lancashire Constabulary have arrested Mr Pumbien and his wife as well as carer Nipawan Berry and questioned them about the standard of care on offer in the home.

Detective Inspector Jes Holland said: 'They are part of an investigation into serious allegations of mistreatment of residents.'

Mr Pumbien and his wife are both registered nurses.

A report by the Care Quality Commission said they were not satisfied with management at the home, (picture posed by a model)

Mail Online understands that the home has 18 single and three shared rooms. Two of the rooms have ensuite facilities following a recent upgrade.

A Care Quality Commission report from November 2011 warned they were not satisfied with management at the home following an inspection.

The CQC said management had failed to notify them of incidents affecting people's care at the home since it was registered with the commission in 2010.

The CQC, who have responsibility for monitoring standards at care homes said: 'We have received information that has led us to carry out an inspection of Briarwood Rest Home Limited. We will publish a report when our check is complete.'

Mike Banks, Lancashire County Council's director of commissioning, said: 'As the local safeguarding authority, we are supporting the police with their investigation into the alleged mistreatment of a number of residents at Briarwood Rest Home in Lostock Hall, near Preston.

'We have also taken the unprecedented step of temporarily putting our own staff in to help run the home, alongside the existing staff, until the owners have confirmed their plans for the future.

'Together with the police, we have held a meeting with the residents' families to bring them up to date, and we are continuing to try to contact a small number of relatives who have not responded so far.

'In the meantime, we have allocated a social worker for every resident at Briarwood and will continue to work closely with our colleagues in the NHS and Care Quality Commission to make sure everyone in the home is safe and well looked after.'
