Sir Bradley Wiggins completed a difficult year by clinching his first world road title on Wednesday with a stunning performance in the time trial.

Already the Olympic champion in the discipline, Wiggins beat three-time world champion Tony Martin by 26.23 seconds over the 47.1km course in Ponferrada, Spain.

Martin took Olympic silver behind the British rider in London two years ago but beat him to the world title in 2011 and 2013.

Wiggins was confident that the hilly course would suit him more than his main rival, and so it proved. He was more than four seconds down on Martin at the 12km time-check but crushed the German in the latter stages of the race.

For Wiggins it proved particularly satisfying given his bitter disappointment with the decision by Sir Dave Brailsford to exclude him from Team Sky at this year’s Tour de France.

‘It’s been an up and down year — obviously I didn’t ride the Tour de France — so I want to dedicate this to my family because they had to put up with me when I was at home in July,’ he said.

One of Britain’s most successful sportsmen can now reflect on 11 Olympic and world titles, on the track and the road, as well as the Tour de France title he won in 2012.

The hour record is simply the longest distance a rider can cycle cycled in one hour.

The current record is 51.115 km set by Jens Voight earlier this month.

It is thought Wiggins would attempt the record in June next year.

But to take the world champion’s rainbow jersey in what he says will be his last World Road Championships must have been particularly satisfying. ‘It’s my last World Championships and I’ve finished with a gold medal,’ he said. ‘I knew coming into it that I had the legs. Once I saw the course I realised if I was ever going to beat Tony again it was on a course like this. I paced it perfectly.’

Wiggins (left, with his new medal) became the first British rider to take world time trial gold since Chris Boardman in the inaugural race in 1994. Now he intends to pursue the Hour Record in 2015.

‘That’s the thing now,’ he added. ‘Just to add the world title to the British title and the Olympic title, I’ve got the set. ‘Very good. Along with the pursuit world titles it’s fantastic.’

Wiggins also won gold in the men's time trial at the 2012 Olympics - his seventh Games medal
