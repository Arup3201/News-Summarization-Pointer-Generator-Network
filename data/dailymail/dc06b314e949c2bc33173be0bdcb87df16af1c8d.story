NFL player Husain Abdullah is back on the field after taking the 2012 season off to make his Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.

Husain Abdullah told his coach at the  Minnesota Vikings last June that he would not be returning to the team because he wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to make the Hajj with his wife, parents and two older brothers.

The athlete completed the month-long journey in October and has restarted his football career, as a safety for the Kansas City Chiefs.

Faith: The Hajj is a journey all able-bodied Muslims are required to make at least once in their lifetime and is the largest spiritual pilgrimage in the world

His older brother is NFL star Hamza Abdullah, who had played for the Denver Broncos, Cleveland Brows and the Arizona Cardinals. Hamza, 29, was among the family entourage that traveled to the Middle East.

Though the spiritual act of a worship, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, meant the players lost out on millions of dollars, Husain says he has no regrets about taking a leave of absence from football.

'It was something that weighed heavy on me,' he told The Kansas City Star.

'It's something Muslims are required to do once in your lifetime, and we didn't necessarily have to do it then. I see my parents getting a little older and sicker, and I was able to take them … it was a dream for them, and it was a dream for me, and to experience that together was awesome.'

Family: Hamza and Husain were raised in a family of 12 children in Los Angeles. The brothers took the pilgrimage to Mecca with their mother, a teacher, and ailing father, a former carpenter

His expressed his gratitude to the league for letting him take the time to honor his faith.

'To get back out here and to have a second chance, not a lot of people get one,' he told the Kansas paper this week.

For now his older brother Hamza, 29, remains a free agent.

The Abdullah brothers announced their intent to step away from football last June.

'You
 know,' Hamza told NBC's Rock Center last November. 'We're playing football, America's number one game. 
We went on a road trip. What's more American than a road trip?'

Born and bred in tough South Central Los Angeles, Hamza and Husain were raised as devout Muslims in a family of 12 children.

Priority: The brothers have said that no amount of success in the NFL could satisfy their aching desire to honor The Hajj

They have said no amount of success 
could satisfy their aching desire to honor The Hajj.

The brothers decided to take with 
them their mother, a teacher, and ailing father, a former carpenter 
whose chronic diabetes leaves him needing daily dialysis treatment.

The Hajj is a journey all able-bodied Muslims are required to make at least once
 in their lifetime and is the largest spiritual pilgrimage in the world.

'We’ve been playing football since we were 8 years old,' Husain told NBC News.

'And although we're knocking down all these barriers, doing things that
 people said you can't do, all of a sudden, it was like there's more to 
life than this. There's more. And we had to go for it.'

But before
 they embarked on the mission, they spent 30 days traveling America, having 'Iftar' - the daily Ramadan fast-breaking 
meal - at a different mosque each night while giving talks on 
fasting and its impact on athletes.

The journey that followed was a far cry from the luxury they had become accustomed to as coveted sports stars in their homeland.

The Hajj is one of the largest spiritual pilgrimages in the world and is embraced by nearly two million people each year

Laid down in the Qu'ran that the journey is a duty that must be carried out at least once by every able bodied Muslim, provided they can afford it

It takes place during the last month of the Islamic year, known as Dhu’l Hijja and once there pilgrims are required to walk seven times around Mecca's most sacred site, the Kaaba, a cuboid shaped building in the center of the holy city

Although pilgrimages to Mecca are thought to date as far back as 2.000BC, it is believed that the first hajj, in which the prophet Muhammad led his followers from Medina to Mecca, was performed by Muslims alone in the 7th century

Once there Muhammad is said to have cleansed the Kaaba and re-ordained the building as the house of God

From this point the hajj became one of the Five Pillars of Islam

The other four pillars are Shahadah, a statement recited in Arabic, the Salat, five daily prayers, the ritual fasting of the Sawn of Ramadan and the Zakat, a charitable donation

It involved traveling in packed buses 
for many hours on end, bustling through vast crowds and sleeping on the 
floors of makeshift accommodation erected to help house the two million
 pilgrims that visit Mecca every year.

First
 they traveled by plane to Saudi Arabia then made a series of long-haul 
bus journeys - some of which became stuck in traffic jams of up to 12 
hours at a time - before completing their journey on foot.

They also swapped their on-field body armor for the requisite 'ihram', a garment of two sheets of white, unhemmed cloth worn by pilgrims to make it impossible to tell who is rich and who is poor.

Hamza said the trip shattered any preconceptions he had about negative foreign feeling towards the US.

He said the first thing he noticed was 'how much the other Muslims we met love Americans.'

The Hajj is one of the largest spiritual pilgrimages in the world and was embraced by nearly two million people last year alone.

Many
 make the journey to Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, as it is laid down in the 
Qu'ran that the journey is a duty that must be carried out at least once
 by every able bodied Muslim, provided they can afford it.

It
 takes place during the last month of the Islamic year, known as Dhu’l 
Hijja and once there pilgrims are required to walk seven times around 
Mecca's most sacred site, the Kaaba, a cuboid shaped building in the 
centre of the holy city.
