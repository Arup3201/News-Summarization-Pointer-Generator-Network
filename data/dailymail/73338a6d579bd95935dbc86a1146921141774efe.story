Chancellor George Osborne has been accused of permanently damaging the economy. The UK could suffer a triple dip recession next year

Britain could suffer a triple dip recession next year because of the ongoing Eurozone crisis.

Leading economists have warned a Greek exit from the EU could plunge the UK into financial chaos next Spring, following a brief recovery from the Olympics.

The triple dip would be unprecedented and could threaten Britain's AAA credit rating.

The news will no doubt pile more pressure on Chancellor George Osborne who has been criticised for making too many cutbacks and crippling Britain's ailing economy.

Azad Zangana, from leading investment company Shroders, said he believed the country's GDP would increase by 0.5 per cent in the current quarter.

He predicted it would continue to grow until March before two consecutive quarters of negative growth, he said to the Sunday Times.

The growth predictions come following the shocking 0.7 per cent decline in the country's GDP which was announced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) last week. 

Michael Saunders from Citigroup said he believed the GDP would only grow by 0.3 per cent in 2013 and confirmed the risk of a triple dip recession.

'My guess is that for the next few quarters, after a technical bounce in the third quarter, the economy will be roughly flat, which I would describe as a disastrously bad outcome compared with previous cycles,' he said.

Meanwhile shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Mr Osborne's refusal to change the Coalition's budget meant he risked permanently damaging Britain's economy.

He said in an interview with the Independent on Sunday that Mr Osborne's

approach of a 'sit on your hands strategy' was dangerous and would leave families and businesses paying a 'long-term price'.

Mr Balls also said it was wrong for the Government to sit and hope that the Olympics would save the country from recession.

'As the IMF (International Monetary Fund) said last week, the long-term impact on the underlying strength of the British economy will be more young people unemployed and businesses investing in other parts of the world,' he said.

'All of those things add up to an economy which ends up permanently weaker, not just temporarily weaker.'

He also appealed to business secretary Vince Cable to join him in creating a new way forward for the economy.

Mr Balls invited the Lib Dem to joine him in a 'new national consensus' which would put Britain on the right track because its what the 'country needs and deserves'.

'I would love there to be a new national consensus on the right way forward, and I would love the Lib Dems to want to be part of that.'

The move will no doubt drive a wedge between defecting Lib Dems and the government.

Concerns for the Eurozone crisis have also deepened following rumours that Spain is considering asking for a £235 billion bailout. However, officials have denied the reports.
