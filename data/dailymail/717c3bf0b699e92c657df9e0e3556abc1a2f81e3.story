A bright flash of light and booming noises in a cramped seat thousands of feet in the air would be enough to put off even the most hardened fliers.

But passengers landing at Birmingham airport on Friday afternoon were led by example as their captain coolly steered them through three lightning blasts and left it until afterwards to calmly explain what happened.

Passengers spoke of a 'massive bang' as one of the bolts struck the body of the KLM service from Amsterdam, but the blasts had no effect on the landing, which proceeded as normal to touch down at 4.30pm.

Thunderstruck: These huge bolts of electricity struck the KLM flight as it came in to land over Birmingham

Bolts: The plane can be seen at the centre of the blasts of electricity

And after the plane, a Boeing 737, had touched down on the 
runway, the captain confirmed to his passengers that the service had 
been hit, saying simply: 'Ladies and gentlemen, you may have noticed we 
were hit by lightning.'

Tony Everitt, 51, was one of 174 passengers on board the flight, from which ominous 'dark skies' could be seen just before the first bolt struck.

The businessman, who was returning from a conference, said: 'It was incredible - there was one 
massive bang. Only moments before, I’d noticed the dark skies and told a
 passenger sitting next to me that I was surprised there was no thunder 
and lightning.

'After the bang, my initial thought was the engine had blown-up. Surprisingly, it wasn’t frightening, it was exciting.

'You are waiting for something else to happen, then you realise nothing has gone wrong.'

Coming in to land: The flight touched down without any problems at Birmingham Airport on Friday

The picture of the plane, caught up in the centre of several branches of a lightning bolt, was taken by Tracy Meakin White, 42, who was watching the storm.

She said: 'I didn’t even see the plane at first, I was just clicking on my phone and then afterwards I saw the aircraft.

'I 
think it is a once in a lifetime picture, I doubt I will see anything 
like that again, I am not a photographer, it was just a stroke of luck I
 got the shot.'

A statement from KLM said: 'Occasionally 
aircraft is hit multiple times by lightning. All pilots and air crew are
 trained to deal with this.'

A spokesman for Birmingham Airport said: 'All aircraft landed safely without incident on Friday afternoon.'

 Although it may sound a terrifying prospect, commercial aircraft around the world are bombarded with bolts of lightning every single day.

According to experts, the in an average year any given airliner can expect to be struck at least once on its travels.

Indeed,
 as the fuselage of most planes is made of conductive aluminium, their 
presence in storm clouds, where huge amounts of static electricity 
gather, can actually trigger the discharges.

But
 due to strict regulations, all passenger planes must be built with 
electrical shielding which protects the inside of the plane from the 
effects of lightning bolts.

Those on board often fail to notice that the plane has been hit at all, or experience nothing more than a quick flash.

It
 is estimated that aircraft shielding is strong enough to withstand 
voltages ten times the amount of a typical bolt, and no planes have been
 brought down by lightning since 1967.

The
 worst which can usually be expected from a lightning blast is a visible
 scorch mark. Occasionally flights which are struck early in their 
journey are diverted as a safety precaution.
