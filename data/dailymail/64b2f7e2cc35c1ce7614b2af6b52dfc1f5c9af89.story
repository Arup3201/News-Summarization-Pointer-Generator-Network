It all started with American hipsters  but now the bizarre trend has hit Tyneside, with Geordie men adorning their beards with a beautiful array of colourful flowers.

The peculiar movement first gained popularity on Tumblr and has since blossomed elsewhere. Though these models will never gain hipster street cred, their floral endeavours are in aid of a more serious cause, raising money for men's health charity Orchid.

The beautiful creations are the work of 48-year-old  florist Sue Shone who says: 'We had recently had people close to us die of cancer, and so we wanted to do something creative to raise money for Orchid, a men's health charity.

Sue Shone trained in art design, which is clear from the tasteful and original arrangement she created in Liam Gallisent's beard

'I had been looking at pictures of men in the 1960s with flowers in their hair and thought that it would be great to being the trend back, and get some local lads involved.'

Sue, from Gosforth, set about recruiting as many local lads as she could and soon had a group of willing bearded and moustached men posing in front of local photographer David Williams. 

The brave calendar boys include fishmonger Blake Fletcher, van driver Jason Halls and heating engineer Michael Sweeney.

She says: 'I put out an appeal on Facebook and was astounded by the response I got. The men who volunteered were fantastic, they really got into it despite the fact they were by and large big, macho men.' 

With the help of her partner Fleming Anott, 42, Sue hopes to expand her  enterprise to photos of women's bikini hair and men's chest and underarm hair interwoven with floral arrangements.

She says 'My daughters are both in their twenties and always removing their hair but I think it should be celebrated.'
