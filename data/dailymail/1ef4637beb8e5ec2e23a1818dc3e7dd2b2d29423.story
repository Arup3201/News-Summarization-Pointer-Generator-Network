Tesco is launching a massive counter-offensive against pound shop stores as it battles to stem the loss of customers to budget outlets.

The nation’s biggest retailer has begun opening heavily-promoted 'pound shop' areas within its stores in a bid to take on thriving Poundland and other low-cost chains.

The new zones have so far been introduced to more than 60 Tesco stores, and the retailer plans to increase this figure to nearly 300 over the next few weeks.

A range of products will be sold for as little as 50p, including items such as health products, kitchen tissues, washing-up liquid, pet food and detergents. 

The Tesco launch highlights just how 
severely the success of the pound shops is hitting the profits of 
established supermarket giants in Britain.

In recent years the no-frills budget shops have become a dominant force in UK retailing, with cash-strapped shoppers flocking to them on a regular basis.

Poundland was founded in 1990 and has 450 stores countrywide, while Poundworld launched in 2004 and has 200 stores. In addition, 99p Stores has more than 200 outlets.

Tesco Pound Shop buying manager Paul 
Bangs said it wanted to ensure shoppers had access to a ‘vastly improved
 range’ of discount products.

He said in a letter to suppliers: ‘This 
is a project that Tesco is taking very seriously. As a new concept, 
implementation will be absolutely key to success.’

Mr Bangs also told trade magazine The Grocer that the retailer would launch new point-of-sale marketing materials including header boards, hanging banners and other signs to encourage people to visit the new areas of the shops.

The magazine added that Tesco has previously attempted to take on pound shops.

A ‘pound shop’ strategy for food and non-food items was implemented in 2009, with an aisle in larger stores just for the lines. A £1 section was then rolled in about 50 stores in 2012.

But one supplier told The Grocer: ‘Tesco are chasing their own shadow at the moment and this could just end with them just creating even more redundant space. ‘

And Steve Dresser from Grocery Insight analysts said: ‘Tesco had to do something about the likes of Poundland but I think shoppers would rather find deals through the normal course of their shop than go down a couple of separate aisles.’

Aldi’s sales growth has accelerated to 34 per cent a year, while takings through the tills at Lidl are rising by an impressive 17 per cent.

The budget chains have made a concerted effort to target middle Britain shoppers who have seen prices rise faster than incomes for the last five years.

They have become known for produce, cheap dairy products and top European food and wine.

Current British market share of the major supermarkets shows Tesco is still dominant but cheaper options are on the rise

Aldi and Lidl are targeting people with everything from fresh Aberbeen Angus fillet steaks at £5 each to award winning wine, coffee and cheese.

And own-label tablets from Lidl and Aldi came second and third respectively in recent tests for the best dishwasher tablets by consumer watchdog Which? – and they were among the cheapest at 10p per wash.

But while the German chains open shops at the rate of one a week, Tesco continues to lose sales despite a £1billion turnaround plan. Its sales in the 12 weeks to April were down by 3 per cent on a year ago.

Last month it was revealed that Tesco's profits had fallen for the second year running as its rivals continue to eat into its market share, which is at a ten-year low.

Britain's biggest supermarket posted a six per cent fall in its pre-tax profits to £3.3billion in the past 12 months, down from £3.45billion a year earlier.

Tesco is still by far the biggest UK supermarket with 28.6 per of market share, but this is down from 29.7 per cent a year ago.

Asda had 17.4 per cent, Sainsbury's had 16.5 per cent and Morrisons had 11.1 per cent in the year ending March 30.

But all have faced a surge from competitors gobbling up customers, with Aldi's share of the market up from 3.4 per cent to 4.6 per cent in the past 12 months.

Waitrose had 5 per cent compared with 4.8 per cent last year, and Lidl also experienced strong growth in a record-breaking month and now accounts for 3.4 per cent of the market.

There is also a perception that with stores such as Waitrose clearly high-end, and Lidl and Aldi clearly low-end, Tesco is losing out on shoppers because it is sitting in the middle ground.

Meanwhile in January, Steve Smith, who founded Poundland in 1990, revealed plans for an online store where everything costs £1.

The minimum order value is likely to be £23, and a 'click-and-collect' system is being considered, which would allow customers to pick up their goods at other stores and shopping centres.
