David Cameron told his wife she did not need to worry about him going for dinner with Silvio Berlusconi – because he would get an aide to pull him out of the Jacuzzi before the ‘whores’ turned up.

Mr Cameron made the quip before heading to Rome for a state dinner with his Italian counterpart, it was revealed today.

Graffiti artist Ben Eine was in Downing Street when the PM cracked the joke after being invited for tea and biscuits. 

Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and David Cameron met for dinner in 2010

Mr Cameron joked to his wife that she did not need to worry about him meeting the billionaire former Italian PM

Earlier this year, Mr Berlusconi was unexpectedly cleared of paying for sex with a minor at a series of sordid 'bunga bunga' sex parties.

The court said the billionaire media tycoon had paid for sex with a 17-year-old prostitute known as 'Ruby the Heartstealer'. But they said there was no proof he knew her age.

Mr Berlusconi, now aged 78, quit as Italy's prime minister in 2011 during a serious escalation of the euro zone crisis but remains politically active and still leads his centre-right Forza Italia party.

He is currently banned from holding public office after being convicted of tax fraud, and has been doing community service at a care home as part of his sentence. 

Mr Eine’s painting Twenty First Century City was presented to Barack Obama in 2010 on Mr Cameron’s first trip to Washington in 2010.

Shortly after ward the artist was invited to Number 10 – just before Mr Cameron was due in Rome for his first meeting with the then Italian leader.

Mr Cameron jokingly reassured his wife that he would not be sharing jacuzzis, Mr Eine told a told a conference in London.

The artist, a self-confessed former graffiti vandal, revealed Mr Cameron’s unguarded remarks during a filmed interview to mark the start of three-day conference on graffiti at London’s South Bank centre.

Mr Eine said the PM had to leave early to travel to Rome. He said: ‘We were sitting there chatting away and his PA or assistant came in and said: “David, we’ve got to go”.

‘And he jumped up and said “Samantha I’ve got to go off to Italy – dinner with Berlusconi. Don’t worry I’ll get so-and-so to pull me out of the jacuzzi before the whores turn up”.

‘And then he walked out the door. And I was like, that’s great, prime ministers aren’t meant to say that in front of bods like me, just in case I do this and repeat the story in front of a video camera.

‘I started off tagging stuff – I’m not meant to be having tea and biscuits with the prime minister.’

Mr Eine praised the Prime Minister but said he would never vote for him, the Guardian reported.

He said: ‘I have never voted in my life and I would never vote Tory.

‘[But] I really enjoyed talking to him. He was interesting, he was funny. He’s obviously a really smart and on the ball man.’

Mr Cameron’s first meeting with Berlusconi came after a 38-year-old prostitute, Maria Teresa De Nicolo, described how she and a host of other women enjoyed a meal with Italy’s prime minister before she and a couple of the others joined him in bed.

A No 10 spokesman said Downing Street never comments on private conversations.
