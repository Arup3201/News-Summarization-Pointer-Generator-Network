Sometimes you just have to go.

And for a passenger on a recent Air Labrador flight in Canada, that meant urinating in a takeaway coffee cup.

Johanna 
Tuglavina was on a flight from Hopefale to Nain 
when she discovered that the plane didn't have a toilet. She then found that the bathrooms at the two airstrips her flight stopped at weren't working.

Last resort: Johanna Tuglavina was forced to urinate in a takeaway coffee cup

Keen to relieve herself, she went outside to urinate before leaving Hopedale because the bathroom was out of order and when she asked to use the restroom during a stop in Natuashish, she also found that it was out of order.

'I said [to the pilot], 'Gee, boy, I'm going to have to use that empty Tim Hortons cup back there because I really gotta use the washroom,' and he had a little smile on his face and he said, "Well, there's a little bag out there too if you need to use it," so I used both,' Tuglavina said.

'It was a choice between peeing in my pants, or peeing in a Tim Hortons cup,' she said.

Out of order: Passengers have been taking desperate measures when airport and aeroplane toilets are out of action

This comes a week after a passenger urinated in a plastic bag on an Air Canada Express flight to Labrador.

Liberal MHA Randy Edmunds told CBC: 'In this day and age, it's not necessary and I don't think it's that hard with the technology these days to go and assess the situation and install a system.'

'I think it takes a story like the one about the passenger on the plane ... a lot of people just take it for granted the toilets are going to freeze up, it's a common thing, but people are just starting to realize that, "Hey, this is not good enough,"' he said.

'We should be able to have the same as everyone else in the province in their airports.'
