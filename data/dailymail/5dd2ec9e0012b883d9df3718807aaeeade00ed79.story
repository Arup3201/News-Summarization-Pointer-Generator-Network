A pair of thugs have been jailed for stabbing a man 11 times in front of his children at a Christmas Day party.

The victim was left fighting for his life after Marbri Brisco, 31, and Junior Mullings, 35, repeatedly knifed him at the festive do in Peckham, south east London. 

The 25-year-old victim, who was at the party with his wife and children, was also punched, kicked and put in a headlock by the vicious duo.

Junior Mullings, 35, pictured left, and Marbri Briscoe, 35, pictured right, have been jailed for 27 months after stabbing a man 11 times in front of his children at Christmas Day party in Peckham, south east London 

Briscoe and Mullings, both from Peckham, were jailed for 27 months after being found guilty at the Old Bailey of actual bodily harm.

The jury returned verdicts of not guilty to attempted murder and not guilty to grievous bodily harm.

Police said the row broke out over a piece of equipment the victim had borrowed days earlier from Briscoe.

The equipment was a filter used in cannabis propagation - the method by which cannabis seeds are germinated.

The two parties had exchanged text messages in the days leading up to the attack.

But despite the victim returning the piece of equipment to Briscoe’s girlfriend, the threats had continued, police said.

The court heard how the victim and his family went to the party at around 3pm on Christmas Day.

When the family arrived at the party, the victim noticed Briscoe, Mullings and a third man - all of whom he had known for a number of years - acting aggressively towards him. They also started shouting abuse.

The defendants were found not guilty at the Old Bailey of attempted murder and grievous bodily harm, but were convicted of actual bodily harm against the unnamed defendant

The victim went to leave, when he was grabbed by one and put in a headlock. From that position he was punched and kicked repeatedly and stabbed a total of 11 times.

Ambulance and police were called to the scene and the victim was rushed to hospital.

After a police investigation, the 
suspects' photographs were circulated. Briscoe and Junior 
Mullings were both arrested and charged with attempted murder on Boxing 
Day.

The pair stood trial alongside a third man, Steven Mullings, who was arrested on January 17 this year.

All three were found not guilty of attempted murder and grievous bodily harm. Steven Mullings was also found not guilty of actual bodily harm.

Met Police Detective Sergeant Iain Smith said: 'This was an incredibly vicious attack - it is difficult to comprehend how a dispute over a piece of equipment could have led to such a distressing outcome and a man with several stab wounds.

'I am satisfied with the result of our investigation and hope that this sentence will send a strong message to anyone thinking to use violence to solve a disagreement.

'We will do all we can to bring violent and dangerous individual before a court.'
