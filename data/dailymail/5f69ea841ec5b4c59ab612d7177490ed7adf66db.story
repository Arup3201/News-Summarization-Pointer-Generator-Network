Lucky escape: Sam Smit, pictured, and his girlfriend Sabra missed the tragic flight to Mount Everest because Sabra was slow packing

Sam Smit may have cursed his girlfriend for taking so long packing for their holiday, but her tardiness saved his life.

Smit, and partner, Sabra, were supposed to be on the first plane out of Kathmandu to Lukla yesterday, where they, with an expedition team, would set off to climb Mount Everest.

But she was dawdling, and they missed the flight, thankfully.

The plane they were originally booked on ended up plummeting to the ground minutes after take off, incinerating all 19 people on board in a terrifying inferno.

'I feel so guilty that I was getting annoyed with her,' Smit told the New York Daily News.

'If she’d been quicker, we wouldn’t be here together today.'

Instead of catching the fatal flight, the couple were booked on the second of three flights set to fly foreign trekkers to the Everest region that day.

'All trekkers book through agencies, not airlines, so we all know it was sure luck that our agency put us on another airline when we got there,' Smit said.

The couple, and fellow passengers on the later flights, were unaware of the horrific tragedy that saw the twin-engine propeller plane crash and burn just 547 yards from the airport until they popped out to get a coffee.

'We went to a restaurant for coffee and it was breaking news,' he said. 'We just stared at the burning wreckage of the first plane on the television.'

added: 'I imagine that all those people who were on that flight were in
the same waiting hall as us. And would have been in small baggage 
reclaim had they made it.'

The pilot of the domestic Sita Air flight reported trouble two minutes after takeoff. It was today revealed that the likely cause of the crash was pilot error rather than a bird in the engine, which was the initial theory.

'A plane crash does not occur simply just because its engine was hit by a bird,' Aviation ministry official Suresh Acharya said.

Thousands of Westerners make treks in the region around the world's highest peak each year and Autumn is considered the best time to trek the foothills of the Himalayan peaks.

'It’s incredibly sad and unnerving,' Smit, an avid mountaineer, told the Daily News.

'The trekkers would have been just like me, who would have dreamt of doing this for years, and would have done the climb up with us at the same time.

'My heart goes out to the friends and family of all who were on the plane.'

No Americans were killed in the tragedy. Seven passengers were British and five were Chinese while the other four passengers and the three crew members were from Nepal.
