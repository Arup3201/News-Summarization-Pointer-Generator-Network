Ashley Williams missed Swansea's opening pre-season match on their tour of the USA after the Premier League club's captain was forced to fly home.

The defender recently put an end to talks linking him away from the Liberty Stadium with a move to Arsenal after he signed a new and improved four-year contract.

But the Wales international, 29, was a notable absentee as Garry Monk's were held by 11-time Mexican champions Chivas Guadalajara in a 1-1 draw in Milwaukee, after conceding a late penalty in a heated match in which defender Neil Taylor was sent-off.

Midfield engine: Jonjo Shelvey kick started his pre-season in America

Swansea (First-half): Fabianski, Rangel, Bartley, Chico, Kingsley, Richards, Shelvey, Sheehan, Routledge, Bray, Gomis(Second-half): Tremmell, Tiendalli, Taylor, Davies, Amat, Dyer, King, Sheehan, Britton (c), Emnes, Donnelly.

Chivas: Rodriguez, Vidrio, Pereira, Salcido, Rodriguez, Arce, Castro, Toledo, Reyna, De Nigris, Bravo

Left-back Taylor was sensationally dismissed after he was caught in an exchange with opponent Jesus Sanchez, reducing both teams to 10 men with just 10 minutes to play.

Williams was not there to cool matters down, however, as he departed the trip
 early due to 'family matters'. While Swansea stressed there was 
'nothing to worry about', but it is unlikely he will return to link-up 
with the squad for their next friendly against Minnesota United.

Nathan Dyer scored what appeared would be the winning goal, on 57 minutes, in front of a healthy crowd of over 31,000 at Miller Park.

The
 winger was one of 10 second-half substitutions made by Monk following a
 goalless first half which featured new signing Befetimbi Gomis playing 
for the Barclays Premier League club for the first time.

The former Lyon striker lined-up 
alongside the likes of Jonjo Shelvey and fellow new boy, goalkeeper 
Lukasz Fabianski before they made way at half-time.

But Swansea's hard work was undone when they were shocked by a penalty decision in the dying moments as Edgar Hernandez stepped up to beat Gerhard Tremmell from 12-yards.
