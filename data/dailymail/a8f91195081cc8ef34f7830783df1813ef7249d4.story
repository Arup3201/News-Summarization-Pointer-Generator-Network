A dead body on a gurney fell out of a coroner's van when a door malfunctioned, sending the corpse into the middle of a busy roadway in Pennsylvania.

The Bucks County Courier Times reports the accident happened around noon on Friday near a shopping center in Feasterville, Pennsylvania.

A photo on the newspaper's website shows the corpse, wrapped in what appears to be a white sheet, lying in the street as cars buzz by.

Bucks County officials are investigating how a gurney, with a deceased person on it, fell out of  a coroner's vehicle and ended up on busy Street Road in Pennsylvania Friday afternoon

One passer-by said they believed the gurney was part of a prank because it seemed so 'bizarre'

The Bucks County Coroner's Office says the driver realized immediately that the door had opened and retrieved the body within minutes.

The office says it 'deeply regrets' the incident.

They released a statement saying 'that a rear door mechanical malfunction had taken place during the transport of a deceased individual on Street Rd'.

A passer-by who helped get the body into the van says he thought it was a prank, calling it 'the most bizarre thing' he'd ever seen.

Bradley said it appeared there was a body in a bag and wrapped in a sheet strapped to the gurney. A photo snapped by the man appears to show just that.

'I helped a woman from the coronerâ€™s office get it out of the road, as it appeared to be broken a little,' Bradley said.
