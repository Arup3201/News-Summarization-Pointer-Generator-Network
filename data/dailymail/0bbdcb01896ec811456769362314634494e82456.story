The snowy and icy weather is by no means over for Britain as gale-force winds battered the country today.

Up to four inches (10cm) of snow is expected to fall in the frozen North East and Scotland, with ice forming overnight and more disruption expected on transport networks.

A biting wind from Russia, nicknamed the
Beast from the East, is making seasonal temperatures of around 5C (41F)
feel far colder.

Sub-zero temperatures are expected into the weekend, with lows of -5 or -6C forecast for tonight, although the South West could reach 8 or 9C over the next few days.

A curious red fox got into trouble on a frozen pond in Bristol when she found her tongue stuck to the ice.

Photographer Bertie Gregory, 19, caught the moment on camera while documenting the life of the young fox, who lives in a park near his home.

He said: 'On this particular morning the pond was frozen over. As this individual was a cub from the previous spring, she was fairly inexperienced and so frozen water proved to be a new and exciting challenge.

'When she finally plucked up the courage to walk out into the middle of the pond, her curious nature eventually led her to lick the ice.

'As we've all found out, a warm tongue gets stuck on cold ice and her's was no exception.

'There was a comical pause as she stood there motionless, tongue stuck, not knowing what to do.

'Eventually the vixen panicked and pulled her head violently upwards, leaving some of the skin on her tongue stuck to the ice.'

Coastal areas are set to suffer the 
worst weather today, with stormy waves smashing into sea walls in the 
North East and 50mph winds making the temperature feel around eight 
degrees
colder than it is.

Scotland and Ireland experienced the highest seas anywhere in the world this week, according to swell models used by wave chasers.

The super-sized waves were taller than a four-storey house.

A buoy called K5, which monitors the sea's movement off the Western Isles in the North Atlantic, recorded wave heights of 14.3m (46.9ft) on Monday.

The data is used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Met Office, with surfers' website Magicseaweed.com in Kingsbridge, South Devon, using it to create swell models.

These forecast wave sizes out to sea and their size close to shore.

Magicseaweed forecaster Ben Freeston said: 'It's been an active winter in the Northern Atlantic with several large storms already.

'Typically a swell in this sort of size range occurs about once per winter approaching Scotland, which is uniquely placed globally for such an event.'

Magicseaweed draws on other meteorological information being shared across the world by trained observers and sent from automated weather stations and satellites.

The forecaster said that as storms pass to the north of Greenland the large, prominent land mass acts almost like an aircraft wing, creating an area of higher speed winds flowing to the east around the tip. This wind pattern builds energy into swells and points itself directly at Scotland.

Mr Freeston added: 'The same storms that create these colossal swells tend to march over the land as the waves arrive, so a typical swell is accompanied by extremely strong winds.

'It's probably accurate to say that Scotland has some of the largest waves on Earth.'

Dave Wheeler, a photographer and forecaster on Fair Isle, in Shetland, was monitoring Monday's swell charts.

He said the high seas were among the worst in living memory on the remote island.

Waves, presented as bright colours on the charts, caused damage on Fair Isle, with the sea smashing a wall at the 120-year-old South Lighthouse and washing the debris several hundred metres inland.

One National Trust worker said he had never known erosions as bad as those that happened recently

Mr Wheeler said: 'No-one can remember damage to this extent at the lighthouse. Monday's sea conditions have been described as phenomenal.'

So-called
‘thundersnow’ was reported in the Peak District, the West of Scotland 
and Northern Ireland yesterday, and forecasters warned of more storms along the east coast today and tomorrow.

The
Met Office issued a yellow ‘be aware’ warning for severe snow in the 
East and North East today, with further warnings out for snow in the 
East tomorrow. Almost 6in (13cm) fell in parts of Scotland yesterday.

The freezing weather is expected to cling on over the next few days after temperatures dipped to -4C (25F) last night.

Temperatures will drop as low as -5 
and -6C tonight , with sub-zero temperatures continuing into the weekend
- although temperatures may reach 8 or 9C in the South West over the 
next few days.

Winds as 
strong as 60mph will make western parts feel colder, however, the Met Office warned.

A
Meteogroup forecaster said: 'It will be another breezy day with chilly 
weather and snow in the North, Scotland and the East of England plus a 
few hail showers.

'It will be cold and clear tonight with a touch of frost, and then a band of rain will move across the West from Ireland tomorrow, bringing snowy showers to North West Scotland and slushy accumulations in the North East, East Anglia by evening.

'Friday will be mostly clear with some showers in the East, while the weekend will see another band of rain and some snow.'

The latest cold snap comes less than a fortnight after blizzards caused chaos across the country.

Low-lying
parts of the country have been devastated by floods over the past two 
weeks, as torrential rains coincided with thawing snow to create 
dangerous conditions.
