Practice makes perfect, but only if you go about it the right way, research claims.

The way a person practices is as important as how often they try to improve - with those who do not cram in sessions but go away and reflect on their mistakes performing better.

And those willing to experiment and learn from their mistakes at the beginning tend to perform better in the long-run.

Researchers followed 854,064 online gamers playing a game called Axon, in which players guide a neuron from connection to connection by clicking on potential targets.

The software was developed by game designer Preloaded to challenge people's perception and decision-making skills while allowing researchers to analyse how practice affects performance.

They found that some gamers scored higher than others despite practising for the same amount of time.

Game play data revealed that players who seemed to learn more quickly had either spaced out their practice or had more varying early performances, before going on to perform better.

The study could also help researchers find new ways of understanding how the brain retains information

This suggests, the researchers believe, that they were exploring how the game worked and taking the time to practice more methodically and 'efficiently' than the lower scoring gamers.

Dr Tom Stafford, from the University of Sheffield said: 'The study suggests that learning can be improved - you can learn more efficiently or use the same practice time to learn to a higher level.

'As we live longer, and as more of our lives become based around acquiring complex skills, optimal learning becomes increasingly relevant to everyone.

'The study confirms that more practice is better but if you space it out instead of doing it all at once then you improve.

'Also people who are most variable in their performance at the beginning perform better at the end.

'The reason is that people who are experimenting at the beginning have to make some mistakes in order to achieve success.'

The study could also help researchers find new ways of understanding the ways in which people learn, as gaming is something that people enjoy and data is easily collected.

Dr Stafford said: 'This kind of data affords us to look in an unprecedented way at the shape of the learning curve, allowing us to explore how the way we practice helps or hinders learning.'

The study was published in Psychological Science.
