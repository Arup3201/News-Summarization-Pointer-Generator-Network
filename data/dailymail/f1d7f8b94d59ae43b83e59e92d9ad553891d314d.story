They were separated just before the Second World War.

And in the 75 years since, Rose Burleigh had caught just one fleeting glimpse of her younger brother John Stubbs – without even realising it was him.

But now brother and sister have been reunited after an amateur genealogist managed to fill in a gap in their family tree. Details of their separation are sparse, lost in the mists of the distant past.

What is known is that Mrs Burleigh, 
77, was adopted by an aunt on the Isle of Wight in 1938 and her surname 
was changed, while Mr Stubbs was looked after by their grandparents in 
Chichester, West Sussex.

Their mother Gladys died in 1941, aged 30, while their soldier father Charles, a driver and officers’ batman, was away at war.

He was captured but escaped, only to be recaptured and sent back to a prisoner of war camp in Germany.

He was not released until the end of the war. Returning home, he went to reclaim his daughter but was turned away.

Mrs Burleigh had given up hope of seeing her brother again, until her friend Roger Mitchell managed to trace him.

‘When Roger phoned to tell me he had 
found my brother and had spoken to him I was overwhelmed,’ said Mrs 
Burleigh, a retired care worker from Exeter.

‘I went into complete shock. I was so 
glad he was alive and well. When I rang him I didn’t have any nerves at 
all. I felt really comfortable chatting with him.

‘Being brother and sister, there was an instant natural connection. It was really emotional and there were a lot of tears.’

Now the brother and sister are catching up on their respective family histories and poring over old photographs

The pair arranged to meet in 
Southampton. Mr Stubbs, a retired highways officer from Chichester, 
said: ‘As soon as I saw her I thought, “Yes, that’s my sister”. I had 
been looking for her for 50 years.

‘I didn’t know her adoptive parents 
changed her name from Stubbs to Kelly which obviously made it tricky. So
 when I got the phone call from Rose we both cried and couldn’t really 
say much.

'We phoned each other again the next 
day and were able to talk more. We have been ringing each other since 
and catching up on each other’s lives.

'We are just so lucky to have found 
each other so late in life.’ They do not know why they were separated 
but Mrs Burleigh remembers as a little girl an incident when a man with a
 boy turned up at her aunt’s house.

‘I remember seeing a man in army 
uniform coming to the house carrying someone,’ she said. ‘But when I 
turned away they were gone. I have spoken to John about that day and he 
said, “The man was our dad and the boy he was carrying was me”.

‘I wasn’t told that was my dad and brother.’ Mr Stubbs believes the adoptive parents refused to hand the young Rose back.

She never saw her father again. Mr 
Stubbs was brought up by his grandparents until he was 15. He then moved
 back in with his father, who died in 1984, aged 70.
