The day began with festive lifeguards and giant blow up Santas and snowman dolls which crowded Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach on Christmas Day.

Social media became a haven for everything Christmas with people posting photos posing on the beach with everything from Santa hats, beers and surfboards.

People also improvised to create snowmen out of sand, complete with decorative Christmas baubles.

Weather forecasts across the country were fairly sublime for the jolliest day of the year with temperatures hitting 28 degrees in Sydney, 30 in Brisbane and 32 degrees in Perth.

Melbourne hit a max of 23 degrees, Adelaide was 22 and Darwin hit 32 degrees.

But at about 4pm in Sydney the sun disappeared under the storm which let out a deep rumble - a warning for beachgoers to run for cover.

The weather in Sydney topped 28 degress on Christmas Day as the sun shone throughout most of the day

The duty forecaster of Bureau of Meteorology told Daily Mail Australia the grim weather began developing in NSW's west from about 1pm.

'We had a forecast for thunderstorms from yesterday so we knew the they were coming,' he said. 

It then moved through the Blue Mountains at 2pm and rolled into Sydney's CBD by 4pm which lasted for about an hour.

'There wasn't much rainfall in the CBD and there were just a few thunderstorms here and there,' he said.

'There are still warnings in place but the storm is moving north. It's hard to rule out anything but we'll probably hear a rumble or two tonight and some lightning flashes.' 

'Storms have put on quite a Christmas light show this afternoon,' NSW Rural Fire Service tweeted on Christmas Day

The duty forecaster says the weather should clear up for Sydneysiders by tomorrow, Boxing Day. 

'Thankfully of this is moving up north-eastern way - so the Hunter Region (north of Sydney) and the mid-north coast,' he said.

'It'll clear up quite a bit especially in the afternoon.'

Unfortunately for Brisbane, this means the storm is heading their way.

'They should expect some showers and stormy weather tomorrow,' the duty forecaster said.

The city will be reaching temperatures of 30 degrees while Melbourne is looking a little grim too with tops of 18 degrees on Friday.

Similar weather is expected in Hobart, also 18 degrees, while Adelaide will reach a sunny 23 degrees.

Canberra will be a sunny 25 and Darwin a cloudy 32. 

As for Perth, the duty forecaster says it's 'the place to be this Christmas' as it had 'perfect sunny weather' today and will experience the same tomorrow - reaching 33 degrees.
