Professor Keith Willett said he would be unhappy if one of his relatives was admitted at the weekend because of a shortage of consultants

The NHS chief responsible for A&E services has said he would be unhappy if one of his own relatives was admitted to hospital over the weekend – because of a shortage of consultants.

Professor Keith Willett, who is leading a review of England’s accident and emergency departments, said his concerns were shared by other senior medical staff.

He said: ‘All consultants recognise there is vulnerability in hospitals over the weekend, and I would challenge any consultant not to have a degree of anxiety if one of their own relatives was admitted to hospital at a weekend, knowing the amount of current senior involvement there is.’

He added: ‘At the moment we see patients taking up hospital beds at weekends, essentially treading water with no progressive treatment or diagnostics and few options to be discharged.’

Campaigners last night called for greater investment in out-of-hours care to end the healthcare lottery, following Professor Willett’s admission on the NHS England website.

John O’Connell, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘If even the head of our A&E departments is concerned for his family, then alarm bells should be ringing.

‘Far too much money is wasted in the NHS and this leaves essential, frontline services stretched. It’s crucial that this waste is cut out so that taxpayers’ hard-earned cash is spent on ensuring patients get high-quality treatment at all times.’

Earlier this year, a study revealed patients undergoing routine surgery at the weekend were 82 per cent more likely to die compared with on a Monday – partly because fewer consultants were on duty.

And an investigation by the  Daily 
Mail last month revealed that only five consultants work overnight in 
A&E across the whole of England.

But the British Medical Association, 
which represents senior doctors, said the NHS simply cannot afford to 
provide the same level of service at weekends.

Professor Willett disagrees and claims a seven-days-a-week operation could actually save the NHS money.

Referring to his experience working in
 Oxford almost two decades ago, he said: ‘We showed how a seven-day 
service could be highly efficient and cost-effective. We reduced 
admissions and shortened length of stay.’

He added: ‘We found that we were able 
to close down the number of beds – in fact it was reduced by 25 per cent
 – and that meant we released nursing costs, with that money going into 
the extra physiotherapy support we needed at weekends.’

The Government wants to improve 
staffing levels and the availability of NHS services at weekends 
following concerns that patients are dying due to poor standards.

Last 
week Dr Andy Mitchell, who oversees the health service in London, said 
there were times of the day when patients were at risk because staff 
were spread too thinly.

He warned that hospitals in the 
capital were ‘at breaking point’ and admitted senior managers were 
constantly ‘trying to patch up’.

In September, an investigation found 
A&E departments are being left in the hands of junior doctors 
between midnight and 8am, overseen by a handful of slightly more 
experienced medics – many of whom are locums.

But Dr Paul Flynn, chairman of the BMA
 consultants’ committee, said senior doctors were available at weekends 
as part of an ‘on call’ rota under their normal contract.
