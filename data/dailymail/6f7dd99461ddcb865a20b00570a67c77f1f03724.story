One of the unintended consequences of the legalization of marijuana in a growing number of states has been a rise in pot-related poisonings involving pets.

Animal Poison Control Center has reported a 30 per cent jump in the number of calls reporting dogs and cats suffering from marijuana poisoning between 2009 and 2013.

According to veterinary experts, the vast majority of the incidents are accidental; dogs tend to rummage through trash and, being indiscriminate eaters, they scarf down anything they come across.

Stoner dogs: Animal Poison Control Center has reported a 30 per cent jump in the number of calls reporting dogs and cats suffering from marijuana poisoning between 2009 and 2013

Dr Matt Booth, of Colorado – a state that legalized recreational marijuana this year - told NBC News his veterinary emergency service sees about a case of pet poisoning a month.

According to veterinarians, dogs and cats react very differently to the effects of cannabis compared to their human counterparts.

If pets consume a small amount of pot, for example in the form of marijuana butter, they become listless or depressed. 

When ingesting higher doses, our four-legged friends - who lack a liver enzyme needed to break down THC - can lose coordination, become incontinent, turn hyperactive and experience body tremors.

'They stagger around dribbling urine everywhere,' said Dr Tima Wismer, of the Animal Poison Control Center.

Other symptoms of marijuana poisoning in dogs include high blood pressure, a drop in heart rate and body temperature, seizures, and in some of the more serious cases, even coma and death.

That is what happened to San Francisco veterinarian Jill Chase's Tibetan terrier, who effectively overdosed on cannabis-infused butter he had found in the trash, San Francisco Chronicle reported in December. 

The pooch spent three days in a coma, but eventually recovered after being treated with IV fluids.

Pot brownies can be especially harmful to fido because they combine marijuana-infused butter boasting high levels of THC - the main ingredient in cannabis - with chocolate, which is a known heart and nervous system stimulant in dogs.

A study by Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society cited by The Coloradoan found that cases of marijuana poisoning in pets has increased fourfold at two Colorado hospitals between 2005 and 2010 - a time span that coincided with a rise in the number of registered medical marijuana users. 

The study looked at 125 cases involving stoned pets at Wheatridge Veterinary Specialists in Denver and Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital.

Only two incidents included in the report resulted in fatalities: a dog and a horse died after eating marijuana-infused baked goods and choking on their own vomit. 

The Pet Poison Hotline, which accepts calls from around the country and Canada, has seen a 200 per cent increase in poisoning cases in the past five years.

Experts say dogs can get high from ingesting bong water (left), but it is baked goods like pot brownies (right) that pose the greatest risks because they combine THC with chocolate, which is inherently harmful to pets

A 2002 study by the American SPCA's Animal Poison Control Center found that 96 per cent of accidental marijuana poisonings occurred in dogs, with 3 per cent in cats and the remaining 1 per cent in other animals.

If a dog has ingested marijuana, veterinarians say one of the ways to treat the sickened pet would be to induce vomiting, or feed it activated charcoal to absorb the THC in the pooch's system.

In some cases, IV fluids may be required to get rid of the toxins.

Veterinarians urge pet owners to avoid leaving marijuana-laced edibles, such as cookies and brownies, unattended.
