The carer of a severely disabled man was captured on film stealing money from him after his suspicious father hid in a bedroom cupboard with a video camera.

Brendan Mudd and partner Mandy Holden, both 46, feared carer Kayleigh Spinks, 22, was stealing disability allowance meant for their son Joe Ware, 21, who has severe cerebral palsy.

The couple hatched a plan to catch the crook who stole money from drawers in their home, in Maidstone, Kent, which was being saved to buy a van to help transport Joe.

Mr Ware's parents today slammed Spinks as 'disgusting'.

Red handed: Spinks is captured on camera as she looks under the bed wearing surgical gloves

Accused: Spinks can be heard denying stealing £1,000 as Mr Mudd accuses her of taking the money

Mr Mudd hid among the clothes in his bedroom cupboard after Mandy went to work and calmly waited for 30 minutes before he secretly filmed Spinks come into the room.

The shocked dad peeked through a gap in the wardrobe curtains and saw the carer take cash from under his bed - wearing medical gloves so she left no finger prints.

He then jumped out of the cupboard, still filming, and demanded Spinks explain what she was up to.

The whole confrontation was caught on
 camera with Mr Mudd demanding 'What are you doing?' as red faced Spinks
 immediately apologised and confessed to stealing £100.

Mr Mudd called police and Spinks, a carer from Maidstone, Kent, was arrested and taken for questioning.

Spinks
 admitted two counts of theft at Maidstone Magistrates' Court last month
 and has now been ordered to do 60 hours of unpaid work and pay £250 
compensation.

On
 the day of the sting on September 13, Mr Ware's mother carried out her 
usual routine of letting Spinks into the house and leaving her to care 
for Joe.

Mr Mudd said: 'As 
soon as Mandy left I heard Kayleigh go outside to her car - I think to 
get the gloves - and then come back inside.

'I
 heard this pitter patter of footsteps as she came up the stairs and 
then she came straight into the bedroom and headed for my bedside 
cabinet.

'The wardrobe is material fronted and
 through a little crack in the curtain I was able to film everything. 
'I'd been crouched down in the wardrobe for about 20 minutes and was 
already really uncomfortable, but I had to stay quiet.

'She
 passed eight inches in front of me and went straight for the bedside 
cabinet. I waited for her to start rifling through and then I jumped out
 and said: "I've caught you!" She started saying "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 
I'm sorry".

'I said to
 her "You've been taking money from us!" and she said "I'm sorry, I only
 took £100 out of the cupboard". Of course I was still recording and it 
was all on tape.'

Captured: Mr Mudd contacted police before Spinks was arrested and taken for questioning

Spinks was convicted for stealing £100. The couple has said a total of £1,000 has gone missing from their home.

Mr Mudd said: 'I feel violated in my own home. To put trust in people and for them to blatantly steal from you is disgusting.'

Mother Ms Holden
 said: 'I was going to leave her a note where the money was saying "I 
know what you are doing" but I was worried that she would run off and 
leave Joe on his own.

'That is when we came up with the idea of Brendan hiding in the cupboard.

'Brendan said as soon as I had driven
 off in my car she was upstairs. She had her medical gloves on so she 
didn't leave any finger prints.

Guilty: Spinks admitted two counts of theft to magistrates and was sentenced to 60 hours unpaid work and to pay £250 compensation

'I never thought a carer would steal from someone so vulnerable. We got on really well, I thought she was a nice girl. I even offered her Joe's old TV when I was getting him a new one.

'I
 have to really trust the carers to come into my house and look after 
Joe, so I am finding it really hard to trust again after she abused it. Even now I'm angered by the thought of someone going through my stuff.'

Spinks, who has a young daughter, was employed by Allied 
Healthcare to feed and look after Joe three times a week while the 
couple were at work.

After she was caught and charged by police Spinks admitted to stealing just £100 in front of Magistrates.

Mr
 Mudd said: 'The police couldn't believe what I'd done. I actually got a
 call from the chief superintendent of Kent Police to congratulate me.

'He
 said I was the talk of the police station because they had never known 
anyone to take it upon themselves to do come up with a plan like that. 
I'm just so glad she's been convicted and punished. What she did was 
disgusting.'

Allied 
Healthcare yesterday confirmed Spinks was immediately suspended 
following her arrest and had not worked for the company since.

A spokesman said: 'The protection of our customers is paramount and we have worked very closely with police on this matter.'

Julie
 Partington, customer services manager at Allied Healthcare, said: 'We 
share the family's anger and disgust at the behaviour of this 
individual.

'As soon as
 this matter came to light the carer was suspended from duties and, 
following a disciplinary hearing, was dismissed. Carers are dedicated to
 serving the needs of the most vulnerable in society.

'Day
 in day out the vast majority deliver the very highest levels of care. 
It is shameful that the actions of a 'bad apple' should harm their 
reputation for dedication and probity.'

A
 Kent Police spokesman said: 'Although it was a distressing experience 
for the family she was working for, their actions helped identify Spinks
 and allowed us to charge her and put her before the courts.'
