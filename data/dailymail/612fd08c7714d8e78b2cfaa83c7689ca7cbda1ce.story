One woman nailed a Jenga move that many have tried but only a trained master could muster. By some miracle the player removed one bottom piece from the whole wobbly stack.

Reddit user Dkbobby's sister-in-law was one of those few players whose game defies nearly every law of gravity.

Footage of the event was posted to YouTube yesterday and already has nearly 1 million views and it's not surprising why.

The trained Jenga player approaches the teetering tower and with a karate chop of her hand manages to remove the one single piece below the stacked wooden blocks.

Amazingly she succeeds and jumps for joy and runs to her family to receive a much deserved embrace.

The beginning: This woman mastered a nearly impossible Jenga move and has the footage to prove it 

Magic in action: With a sweep of her hand she knocks the block out from under the stack

Rejoicing: The master move is nothing short of a miracle and the woman did a little victory dance
