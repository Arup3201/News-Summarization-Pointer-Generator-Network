Energy bosses were attacked over their ‘Premiership football’-style pay yesterday as they announced they were on course to make huge profits on the back of soaring energy bills for millions of families.

British Gas – which hiked its prices by six per cent in December – is on course to make profits of £602million after gas use soared almost 20 per cent over the cold winter.

Its parent company Centrica is poised to make profits of £1.4billion for 2013.

Shareholders attacked the 'Premiership football'-style pay of energy bosses at British Gas's parent company Centrica, which is poised to make £1.4billion in profit for 2013

Chief executive Sam Laidlaw is paid £36,000 a week after tax and also has another lucrative role at HSBC

Bosses insisted the enormous takings would help them now ‘keep prices low’ for customers.

But furious shareholders turned on chiefs at the company’s annual general meeting yesterday – saying Centrica was seen ‘as one of the evil big six’ energy firms and its ‘smooth assurances’ meant nothing to families who had seen energy bills double in just seven years.

Consumers, pensioner groups and private investors hit out during furious exchanges after infiltrating the meeting in London yesterday.

They also claimed the price rises, which came at the start of what turned out to be one of the longest and coldest winters in living memory, had contributed to scores of deaths from the cold.

Chief executive Sam Laidlaw – who is paid an astonishing £36,000 per week after tax – was savaged over his ‘premier league’ salary package. Shareholders also demanded to know how he had time to take on other lucrative roles with HSBC and the Department for Transport, which earned him an additional £125,000 a year.

One shareholder demanded: ‘How can you tell us one man is worth £36,000 after tax and does not play in the Premier League?’

Chairman Sir Roger Carr was asked how many of the claimed 7,200 deaths related to fuel poverty last year could be laid at the company’s door. He replied: ‘We’re not a welfare operation, we have to make money.’ He denied allegations of rip-offs and insisted Mr Laidlaw’s pay was justified, saying: ‘everybody operates in a market of talent’.

British Gas’s 16million customers have seen their tariffs double in the past seven years. The average British Gas dual fuel bill last year was £1,188. The six per cent rise last December hit at the same time as average gas use rose by 18per cent year-on-year, taking the average winter energy bill up by around £70 to £400.

Small investor John Farmer said Centrica was viewed ‘as one of the evil big six’ whose customers who felt ‘exploited’ by rising bills.

London pensioner Beatrice Coker said she faced a winter energy bill of £600. She said: ‘How can I manage to pay for my other bills?’

The company insisted it will use the extra income made during the winter to delay future price rises.

Finance director Nick Luff said: ‘We make a margin selling gas. We will have made a higher margin because of the extra volume and we will use that to keep prices down during the rest of the year.’

Official customer body Consumer Futures said the pledge to hold prices steady was the absolute minimum consumers would expect given the firm’s profits.

Some 8 per cent of shareholders refused to back the group’s pay arrangements last year, which saw Centrica’s top five executives share a £16.4million pay bonanza.

As well as his job at Centrica, Mr Laidlaw is a non-executive director at the Department for Transport, which entitles him to a £20,000 annual public salary, which he waived. It is understood he  does not claim expenses for the role. He is also a director at HSBC with a salary of £125,000.

A Centrica spokesman stressed Mr Laidlaw’s focus remained in the firm.
