Exposing nuclear reactors to the elements might not seem like the best idea.

But a team of engineers have revealed how their design to place nuclear reactors in water could save lives.

These plants would use the surrounding water to safeguard themselves in the event of a natural disaster that could cause a meltdown.

When an earthquake or tsunami hits a nuclear plant, that event in itself is not the biggest threat. The greatest danger is actually the after-effects – failing to cool down a reactor core can be deadly.

With
 that in mind, a team of engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT) have unveiled their designs to place nuclear reactors 
at sea, where there is an abundance of cooling water for such 
situations.

The idea is due to be presented at a symposium held by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers this week.

MIT professors Jacopo Buongiorno, Michael Golay, Neil Todreas and others will present the proposal.

They argue that placing nuclear reactors at sea makes sense, and could save lives.

‘The biggest selling point is the enhanced safety,’ Buongiorno says in a release from MIT.

‘It’s very close to the ocean, which is essentially an infinite heat sink, so it’s possible to do cooling passively, with no intervention,’ he says.

In the design, a floating platform containing the nuclear plant would be located several miles offshore.

It would be moored in about 330 feet (100 metres) of water.

This would make it unaffected by tsunamis, and earthquakes would also have no direct effect.

One
 of the issues that faced nuclear plants in emergency conditions, such 
as at Fukushima, Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, was overheating during
 meltdown.

This would be almost impossible at sea, according to Buongiorno.

‘The reactor containment itself is essentially underwater.

The concept of a floating nuclear plant is not in itself unique, as Russia is building one now barged off shore.

This would be the first, however, far enough away to be able to ride out a tsunami.

Another advantage is that building nuclear plants on land can be expensive.

They need to be located near water, which can make construction costly and difficult.

As Buogiorno points out, however, ‘the ocean is inexpensive real estate.’

Decommissioning would also be easier – at the end of it’s lifetime the plant could be towed to a central facility, much like modern Navy ships carrying reactors are. 

A cutaway view of the proposed plant shows that the reactor is located deep underwater, with its containment vessel surrounded by a compartment flooded with seawater, allowing for cooling even in an accident

The concept is flexible, so the reactors could range from small to big; 50-megawatt plants to 1,000-megawatt plants.

These sea-faring plants would probably find their greatest marked in Asia, where regions have high tsunami risks in addition to increasing power demands.

‘I think this is technically very feasible,’ says Toru Obara, a professor at the Research Laboratory for Nuclear Reactors at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

‘Of course, further study is needed to realise the concept, but the authors have the answers to each question and the answers are realistic.’

When exactly we could see floating nuclear reactors like this is not known, but it could be a very attractive design proposal in years to come.
