A tour guide stunned a bus load of tourists when she launched into a racist tirade about San Francisco's Chinatown on her last day of the job.

Holding a bottle of what appears to be alcohol in one hand, the woman was filmed as she told tourists exactly what she thought of the vibrant area in an expletive-laden speech.

The guide even warned potential residents against moving to Chinatown, despite it being the cheapest neighbourhood in the city.

'F*** your pre-school and your little pre-schoolers making all that noise at 6am when I was trying to live here,' she yelled into the microphone at the top of an open-roof tour bus.

'F*** your noise, f*** your parades, f*** your dragons, f*** this, f*** Chinatown.

'F*** your herb gardens sea food markets.

'When you come to America you've got to assimilate a little bit. And in America we don't eat turtles and frogs.

'There's a limit. F*** your laundry hanging out your windows. F*** your hair salons where no one knows how to speak English.'

She claimed that when she lived in the area it was unbearably busy with too many people crowded into a small place.

'We have a Chinatown in my hometown LA, but it is much cleaner with better restaurants.

'This is a horrible place to live. Although this is the cheapest neighbour do not live here. There's too many of them out here.' 

In the video posted to YouTube by a German tourist, the guide got the occasional laugh from the group and even managed to pull a chorus of 'F--- Chinatown' as the bus headed into a tunnel.

It is not certain what company the guide worked for but according to the post it was her last day. 

The footage  provoked a mixed response from people on Youtube, with many criticising her for the xenophobic comments.

Kathleen said: 'She says tons of racist things, tells Chinese people to assimilate... and then says 'I'm not racist okay'...right. Sadly, this lady really needs to be corrected- Chinatown is not the cheapest neighborhood to live in, its actually quite expensive if you can even find a place for rent or lease there- plenty of cheaper neighborhoods in the city of San Francisco. 

'All the things she mentioned- herb shops, frogs, not speaking English, etc. its a part of Chinese culture- makes chinatown 'chinatown,' its not called Americatown right?'

Emil Stewart said: 'Well if it wasn't her last day of work then I am sure it is now. It's a shame in a city of such diversity that she has to point out differences in each other in such a negative light.'  

San Francisco's Chinatown is the oldest  in North America, created by an influx of Chinese railroad workers and gold prospectors in the mid-1800s.

Ethnic Chinese make up the largest minority group in the city, accounting for a little over 20 percent of the population according to 2010 Census data.
