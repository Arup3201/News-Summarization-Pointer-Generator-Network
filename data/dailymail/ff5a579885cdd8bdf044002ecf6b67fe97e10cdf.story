A furious Jet Blue passenger claims she was kicked off her flight from Philadelphia to Boston on Tuesday night because she live-tweeted accusations the pilot might have been drunk.

Lisa Carter Knight says flight staff and the pilot prevented her from re-boarding the plane after she posted pictures to Twitter and commented that the pilot was undergoing a sobriety test following a passenger's ill-judged joke.

The marketing executive, who was traveling to visit her sick mother, claims that even after the pilot passed the test the JetBlue flight staff refused to allow her back on the plane and is outraged posting her personal opinion online cost her the chance to fly.

Fury: Lisa Carter Knight claims that JetBlue staff refused to allow her back onto her Boston bound flight from Philadelphia because she live-tweeted the pilot undergoing a sobriety test

'JetBlue has denied me service at all on any flight back to Boston because a pilot made a decision that my social media interaction with my friends and family was not appropriate and was not going to be tolerated by him,' wrote Knight. 'So, I was thrown off the flight tonight.' 

Knight, who was planning to travel to New Hampshire to visit her cancer-survivor mother told MyFoxPhilly that the flight was originally delayed at 9pm.

Pictures and tweet: Knight uploaded this tweet explaining to her followers that the pilot was being tested for drinking on Tuesday evening

Follow up: The flight was supposed to leave Philadelphia for Boston around 9pm on Tuesday but was delayed for nearly four hours while the pilot underwent his sobriety test

Knight, who works for DrinkWater Productions, says that annoyed passengers were crowding the jetway when someone waiting joked that they hoped the bar was fully stocked.

Just moments later, according to Knight, the pilot appeared on the jetway from the plane and said that he had been accused of drinking and now wanted everyone to go back to the gate while he underwent a sobriety test.

According to MyFoxPhilly, another passenger had sparked the test when he joked with the pilot about his late arrival, saying, 'This flight's late, were you at the bar?'

It was while the pilot was being tested that Knight began live-tweeting as she and other passenger's waited.

Live-tweeting: Knight's follow up postings make it clear that she was not abusive and end with her being denied access to the plane which departed around 1am on Wednesday morning

However, Knight claims that when the pilot was given the all-clear she was not allowed back onto the plane.

JetBlue denied that Knight was denied her seat on the plane because of her tweeting and said that their policy extends only to disruptive passengers.

However, the airline did not specify what disruptive behavior Knight is supposed to have acted out before she was due to board.

'It is not our practice to remove a customer for expressing criticism of their experience in any medium. We will remove a customer if they are disruptive and the crew evaluates that there is a risk of escalation which could lead to an unsafe environment,' said a spokesman from JetBlue.

'The decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly. 

'If we feel a customer is not complying with safety instructions, exhibits objectionable behavior or causes conflict at the gate or on the aircraft, the customer will be asked to deplane or will be denied boarding especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of accelerating in the air.

'In this instance, the customer received a refund and chose to fly on another carrier.'

Furious at being left behind by the flight staff, Knight got in contact with local media in the early hours of Wednesday to express her anger.

Waiting: Knight contacted local news and told them that she was still waiting in Philadelphia airport to leave to see her sick mother on Wednesday morning

'I was just doing what I normally do with my kids, sharing information with my friends that I was frustrated that I was sitting there without a flight home and I miss my children,' said Knight to Eyewitness News.

'Now I’m here at one o’clock in the morning with my mother, who had surgery this weekend, to pick me up because a JetBlue pilot made a decision to kick me off his flight.'

JetBlue have said they are planning to investigate Carter-Knight’s exclusion from the flight.
