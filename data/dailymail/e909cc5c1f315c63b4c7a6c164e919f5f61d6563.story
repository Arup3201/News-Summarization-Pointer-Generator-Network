Writing a journal has been one small factor in Danny Cipriani’s career revival and, after his try-scoring return for England at Twickenham on Saturday, he knew what the next entry would be.

‘Probably about the reaction I got, which was very humbling,’ said the Sale fly-half, after his first appearance at HQ since 2008.

The 27-year-old was touched by the hearty ovation from the capacity crowd when he came on as a last-quarter replacement and he responded by scoring seconds later, as England put Italy to the sword.

Danny Cipriani vowed that he has learnt his lessons after England return on Saturday

‘I did feel like I had been away for a while and it was one of the highlights of my career to get back out there,’ said Cipriani.

‘The reaction I got from the crowd filled me with confidence. I saw Jonny (May) going down the wing and he gave me the pass. He did all the work to be honest. It was a fast start for me, but it was all down to Jonny. I was on the receiving end for once, which was nice.’

Almost seven years ago, the then Wasps No 10 illuminated the national stadium with a breathtaking playmaker’s display on his full Test debut — orchestrating an emphatic victory over Ireland.

Yet his cameo against the Azzurri was his first outing in the RBS 6 Nations since that heady day, as injury, a stint in Australia and misgivings about his attitude checked the rise of a stellar talent.

But he has knuckled down at Sale — aided by Jonny Wilkinson’s mentor, Steve Black — and forced his way into Stuart Lancaster’s World Cup plans, as back-up to first-choice fly-half George Ford.

Asked how he had changed since he ran amok at Twickenham as a 20-year-old rookie, Cipriani said: ‘I’m just a bit older and uglier I guess!

‘I’ve learned a lot of lessons in the last seven years. If someone had told me to meet Steve Black when I was 20, I would probably have politely declined. You don’t think about those things at that age, but as you get older you mature and see things in a different light. You grow up and gaps in your life get filled. I just feel like I’m in a much wiser position and more stable. But I’m only 27, so I’m a good three or four years off my peak — and I can still shift about a bit!’

Back in 2008, rugby seemed to come easily to Cipriani, even at Test level, but he admits that he didn’t savour the honours that came his way. In that regard, he is making up for lost time.

‘I probably took it for granted a bit back then,’ he said. ‘You don’t really appreciate the moments as they come along. That’s what I’m doing now, appreciating every moment and experience and there’s no way I want to be out of this England side ever again for as long as I’m playing. I’m very focused on making the best of my ability.’

When the national team beat Wales at the start of their championship campaign in Cardiff, Cipriani was an unused replacement. At Twickenham last weekend he was brought on 17 minutes from the end but made his presence felt.

He knows that Owen Farrell will be back from injury and on the coaches’ radar again long before the World Cup but Cipriani is determined to be patient and seize any opportunities that come his way.

‘Any chance I get to get on the field, I try to take it,’ he said. ‘Everyone on the bench is like that . . . I am not going to wish anyone else to slip up. I am just going to keep working on what I am doing and at some point the opportunity may come.

‘It’s all building blocks and moving forward. If I have to come on for 18 or 19 minutes and put my hand up in that time, that’s what I’m going to have to do.

‘If I have to come on for the last five minutes and kick the leather off the ball or whatever it is, I will keep doing it.’

These are the selfless sentiments which have helped Cipriani regain an England place and prove that he is indeed wiser now.
