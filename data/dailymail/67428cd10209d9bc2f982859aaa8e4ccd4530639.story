This should come as no surprise to anyone who has experienced pre-flight anxiety while travelling with their significant other.

A study from the Airline Passenger Experience Foundation (APEX) analysed the things that passengers worry about the most while travelling and it revealed that men and women have conflicting priorities or fears before a flight.

It turns out the biggest worry for most men is whether the flight will depart on time, while women are most concerned about getting to the airport on time.

As for what they would like to see improve on a flight, 26 per cent of women say they want better lavatories, compared to 16 per cent of men.

Overall, the number one request from passengers is better in-flight connectivity for wifi or mobile phone use, according to the APEX survey of nearly 1,650 people from eight countries (UK, US, Germany, China, Japan, Singapore, Australia and Brazil).

And it appears Germans and Brits are the chattiest passengers as they spend 50 per cent more time conversing than travellers from other countries.

Seven out of ten respondents said they are satisfied with the quality and selection of in-flight snacks or meals.

The study also looked at how passengers spend their time on planes.

Sixteen per cent of the time is spent sleeping, while 15 per cent is dedicated to watching in-flight films or television programmes.

That was followed by reading for pleasure (12 per cent), watching films or programmes on a personal device (nine per cent) and eating (eight per cent).
