Charged: Ryan Quinton, 27 (pictured) pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide in the death of his new bride on December 30, 2013

A drunk driver who killed his new bride as they left their wedding reception has pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide.

Ryan Patrick Quinton, 29, was charged with DUI, first degree vehicular homicide, laying drag, reckless driving, and a failure to maintain his lane over the December 29, 2013 crash which claimed the life of 25-year-old Kali Shay Dobson.

He was sentenced to 15 years, but only two to three months of that sentence will be behind bars, with the rest of his sentence on probation.

He will also lose his license for five years.

Quinton also pleaded guilty to another incident of drunk driving in May 2014, just months after the crash. 

Quinton had a blood-alcohol level of 0.114, well above the legal limit in Georgia of 0.08 for over 21s, when he lost control of the Pontiac Firebird and careened down an embankment on Highway 5 near Old Canton Rd in Georgia.

Dobson, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was ejected from the car which landed on top of her. She died at the scene.

Just last week Dobson's family came out in support of Quinton, saying he was like their own child.

'He is my son and a brother to my daughters now and an uncle to my grandbabies. We support him in any way we possibly can,' Dobson's grieving mother, Linda Jordan, told The Marietta Daily Journal.

'We can’t stand to see something happen to him. We’re behind him. Whatever it takes, we’re right there for him.'

Jordan said the family had already suffered enough and would struggle to cope with a lengthy court case.

'We shouldn’t have to endure all this, too,' Jordan said.

After the horrific crash, Quinton ran to the road where, with his clothes torn and covered in blood, he flagged down help.

Chris Thomas told Channel 2 that he was driving along Ball Ground Highway when he spotted Quinton wearing a shredded tuxedo and stumbling along the road.

'His shirt was all torn up and he was 
bleeding,' he said. 'He had blood all over his face and blood coming out
 of his hands and stuff and just looked bad. And it scared me to death.'

He comforted the sobbing man as they waited for emergency responders. He held the Quinton's hands and they prayed together.

'There
 was nothing that could be done,' Thomas said after returning to the 
crash site. 'The car was on top of her. You couldn't even see her.'

After the tragedy, distraught friends and family visited the spot where Dobson had lost her life.

'Some bridesmaids showed up and then things got really, really sad and hopeless for a minute,' witness Chris Thomas told Fox5. 'It was horrible all the way around. And tragic. 

'What
 should have been the greatest, most beautiful day of their lives is the
 end of one and what could very well be something hard for this young 
man to get over. I pray that he will.'

Happier times: A Facebook image shows Dobson's engagement ring

Friends and relatives expressed their heartbreak on Facebook pages and shared photos of the couples grinning and dancing at the reception just hours before the tragedy.

The wedding photographers, Still Pearl Photography, also shared stunning images of the beautiful bride before her vows and dancing happily with her new husband afterwards.

Patsy Jordan, a Cherokee School Board member, who once worked with Dobson’s mother, told the Marietta Daily Journal that the community was stunned by the tragedy.

'It’s traumatic,' Jordan said. 'Just to think she just got married and started on her beautiful journey of life and it just ended so suddenly. It was just hard to wrap my brain around something like that.'

Jordan said she Dobson, who had sisters and was close to her new sister-in-law, had a beautiful singing voice.

'Kali was just an absolutely beautiful, beautiful girl,' she said.

Nearby Wheeler House, which held the couple's wedding and their reception, passed on their thoughts to the heartbroken families.

'Our
 thoughts and prayers are with the Dobson and Quinton families,' the 
company wrote on its Facebook page. 'May Kali and the love this 
beautiful couple shared never be forgotten.'
