Sickening claims that British troops executed innocent Iraqis in cold blood were sensationally dropped at a war crimes inquiry yesterday.

After a year-long inquiry costing taxpayers £22million, the case fell apart when relatives admitted there was no hard evidence the insurgents were unlawfully killed in UK custody.

Lawyers for the families accepted the men were killed during a ferocious firefight, dubbed the Battle of Danny Boy, near Basra in 2004.

The extraordinary concession came on the final day of evidence at the Al Sweady Inquiry into claims that soldiers mutilated, tortured and abused detainees.

It provoked outrage that British troops accused of the most serious crime have had their names ‘dragged through the mud’ by publicly-funded lawyers.

The collapse of the central allegation is certain to have severe implications for more than 100 others involving claims of abuse by British troops in Iraq.

The public inquiry was announced in 2009 after a long legal battle between Iraqi  families – represented by Phil Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers – and the Ministry of Defence. The Birmingham-based firm  has alreday been paid millions from the public purse.

But in a statement, Public Interest Lawyers said: ‘Following the conclusion of the military evidence and current state of  disclosure by the MoD, it is our view there is insufficient material to establish  that Iraqi civilians were unlawfully killed whilst in the custody of  British troops.’

Inquiry chairman Sir Thayne Forbes said the statement was ‘of very considerable significance’.

Last night Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded UK forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘Many in Iraq and Afghanistan have sought to discredit British soldiers for political purposes or have made claims for personal financial gain.

‘In some cases, these people have been wittingly or unwittingly looking to turn a quick buck at the expense of our fighting troops.

‘It is tough for the MoD, who are under great pressure to answer these cases, but to avoid wasting public funds we must be ready to make stronger rebuttal.’

Former infantry officer Patrick Mercer, an independent MP, said: ‘This drives a coach and horses through the very texture and core of this case.

‘I do wonder if our enthusiasm for prosecuting our own soldiers has been excessive. This has left the nation poorer and demoralised our Armed Forces’ morale.’

A Whitehall source said: ‘The taxpayer has been led a merry dance by PIL whose charlatan clients have, it seems, simply falsified accounts – all underpinned by  public money. Human rights lawyers have cost taxpayers a staggering amount of money.’

Mr Shiner, 57, has made his name pursuing British soldiers through the courts over alleged war crimes in Iraq. He has represented alleged victims of abuses by troops, including relatives of Baha Mousa, who died in 2003 in British custody.

On Afghanistan, Mr Shiner led a legal case that ended with a 2010 High Court block on the transfer of detainees from Camp Bastion to the Afghan authorities, compelling the British military to keep Taliban prisoners in detention.

He was awarded the title ‘Human Rights Lawyer of the Year’ in 2004.

On his firm’s website, his profile reads: ‘Phil is a committed socialist and the roots of his career as a lawyer are firmly planted in the law centre movement of the 1980s.’

The Al Sweady hearing was examining allegations that troops executed 20 or more prisoners and mistreated nine others after the battle at the Danny Boy base. It was named after Hameed Al Sweady, 19, one of those who died. The Iraqis had alleged troops from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders took bloody revenge at a camp and detention facility for the massacre of six Royal Military policemen a year earlier.

The claims were strenuously denied by the Ministry of Defence, which insisted the men were insurgents killed in battle.

Enemy dead would normally be left on the battlefield. The UK soldiers were apparently given an order to identify those killed to try to find the ringleader in the murder of the six Red Caps.

In a statement, John Dickinson, of Public Interest Lawyers, said: ‘From the outset, the families have had the simple objective of discovering the extent of any wrongdoing and, if so, how it came about and who was responsible. It is accepted that, on the material which has been disclosed to date, there is insufficient evidence to support a finding of unlawful killing.’

The firm said there were still ‘numerous’ claims of abuse of prisoners for the inquiry to consider.

So far, it has sat for 167 days and heard evidence from 281 witnesses, of which 55 were Iraqi and 221 from the British military.

Some 15 Iraqis travelled to the UK to testify and another 40, including relatives and medical staff, gave evidence via videolink from the British Embassy in  Beirut, Lebanon.

Closing submissions will be heard next month.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘We have long said that there was no credible evidence for these allegations and are pleased that they have been withdrawn.’
