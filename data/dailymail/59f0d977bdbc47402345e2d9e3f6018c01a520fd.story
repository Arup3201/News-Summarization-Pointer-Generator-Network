Vodafone and O2 customers are now able to access high-speed 4G internet on their mobiles – but only if they own one of a handful of brand-new smartphones.

The networks launched the service yesterday in a bid to rival EE, which introduced its 4G package last October.

O2 has now switched on 4G in London, Leeds and Bradford. However Vodafone has so far only launched it in some parts of London ahead of its UK-wide roll-out.

Vodafone will offer Premier League football and music downloads as part of its 4G packages. Customers will be able to choose from unlimited music downloads from Spotify or free Sky Sports, as part of the bundle. The firm launched its 4G service with a football match in Trafalgar Square (pictured)

Consumers are still confused about the merits of 4G technology, a report suggests.

One in five people think the high-speed broadband won't improve their current service and one in three say they do not need 4G, it found.

A third of consumers also said they believe it would be too expensive to switch to the speedier services.

Dominic Baliszewski, a telecoms expert at comparison site broadbandchoices.co.uk, said; 'More people are aware of 4G now compared to when it first launched last year, but most still do not understand the difference it will make to their experience as a mobile user.'

'Just like the black and white televisions of yesteryear, 3G is doing a perfectly good job for millions of customers - but 4G is the technicolour revolution.'

The service lets users surf the web at speeds that are between five and seven times faster than 3G.

But
experts last night warned customers to ‘think very carefully’ about the
cost of changing before making the switch. Both O2 and Vodafone 
currently offer fewer than 15 mobiles that work with their 4G networks.

This
means that most customers – including those who own the iPhone 5 – will
have to purchase a new phone before they can upgrade.

Even with a compatible handset, existing customers will pay on average £5 a month extra for a 4G tariff.

Millions will then be unable to access the 4G service in their hometown for months or even years.

Ernest
Doku, a technology expert from comparison website USwitch.com, said: 
‘This could prove  very expensive for customers, so people need to 
consider the extra costs.

‘You
need to ask if you can get 4G in your area and when will it arrive, as 
well as how much you will need to spend to upgrade your phone to one 
which is 4G-compatible.

‘A 
lot of people will have to pay a few hundred quid to buy a new phone and
break their contract, even those with relatively new smartphones. 

‘Lastly, you need to ask yourself if the more expensive tariff will be worth it. Not everyone will need faster internet.’

He added: ‘Naturally over time people will change to 4G but there is a lot to think about at the moment.’

The 4G system allows smartphones, tablets and laptops to surf the web around five times faster than over 3G, although Vodafone claims its network is, on average, six times faster. It launched the service with the help of ex Arsenal legends Ian Wright and Tony Adams as well as ex Spurs heroes Ledley King and Les Ferdinand

Vodafone spent £802 million when it bid for part of the mobile phone spectrum to provide 4G, while O2 spent £550m to buy a proportion of the lowest frequency spectrum. Les Ferdinand and Ian Wright are pictured launching Vodafone's 4G service

Subscribers to 4G can download a song in four seconds or post a photograph to a social networking site in six seconds.

They
will also be able to watch films, videos and television straight from 
the internet as easily and quickly as from a home computer.

O2
and Vodafone have pledged to have 4G network coverage in more cities by
the end of the year – including Birmingham, Coventry, Edinburgh, 
Glasgow, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and 
Sheffield.

But they will still lag some way behind EE, which already offers their 4G service in 105 UK towns and cities.

Telecoms
expert Dominic Baliszewski said now might not be the right time to 
switch, but insisted 4G internet will soon start to grow in popularity.

He
said: ‘Just like the black-and-white televisions of yesteryear, 3G is 
doing a perfectly good job for millions of customers – but 4G is the 
Technicolor revolution.’

O2 is launching in London, Leeds and Bradford with a further 10 cities including Liverpool and Newcastle expected to be connected by the end of the year. O2's tariffs start at £26 a month and come with 12 months free music when bought direct from O2

EE, which was formed from the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, was the first company to offer a 4G network in the UK.

EE
held the monopoly on the network because regulator Ofcom gave it 
permission to use existing spectrum (1800MHz) that it already owned.

Ofcom then held an auction for companies to bid to use other parts of the spectrum from 800MhZ to 2.6GHz.

O2 purchased 800MHz lots and Vodafone won both 800MHz and 2.6GHz lots.

For
the typical user, download speeds of initial 4G networks should be at 
least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3G networks.

In
July, EE announced it was doubling its 4G speeds for people in 
Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Derby, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, 
Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield.

The speed boost makes the network twice as fast as current average 4G speeds and 10 times as fast as 3G.

Mobile
network Three has kicked off a price war earlier this week over the new
4G service by announcing it will offer the super high-speed internet at
no extra cost.

The firm’s 
1.5million customers will get 4G at the same price they pay for the 
current 3G network, with packages of calls, texts and unlimited internet
from £15 a month. 

The Three deal will start in mid December, cashing in on Christmas handset sales.

Vodafone's 4G tariffs start at £26 per month. Vodafone will offer Premier League football and music downloads as part of its superfast packages and anyone signing up will be able to choose from unlimited music downloads from Spotify, or free Sky Sports, as part of the bundle
