Using the wrong amount of kisses in a text message has been revealed as the top turn off in romantic phone etiquette.

Whether it’s a new romance or a long-term relationship, sending fewer kisses in a text than a partner is considered impolite and a brush off.

Answering the phone at dinner, and having it switched on in the cinema were also included in the list, alongside texting after 11pm, resending the same text if no response is received, and emailing pointless small talk.

The study, compiled by TalkTalk Mobile, found that over half of British men believe it is acceptable to end a relationship over text, whereas 62 per cent of women think that only face-to-face break ups are acceptable.

Do

Keep flirting to text - don’t try and pull it off on a call.

Turn off your phone when you’re out for a meal or at the cinema and give dates your full attention.

Give your friend your phone when tempted to drunk call or text.

Reply to texts within a couple of hours.

Text a partner good morning and goodnight.

Don’t

Finish a relationship by text.

Resend the same text if you haven’t had a response yet.

Text unnecessary small talk, like ‘Hey howz u’ or more than two texts without a reply – it looks needy.

Use acronyms like LOL, K, G2G.

Put more or fewer kisses than the other person.

The findings were uncovered as part of a study of 1,000 Britons.

Overuse of acronyms, such as LOL, were cited as one of the most common reasons a partner may lose interest, as they make the sender seem overly keen or too needy.

Good text etiquette was found to include texting a lover good night, replying to messages within two hours and asking questions to stimulate conversation.

While over three quarters of people believe they have good mobile relationship manners, four in ten people have completely misinterpreted a poorly written text - and sarcasm is the most common pitfall.

Those in the south west of the UK were found to be the neediest partners when communicating via text and are most likely to send multiple texts before getting a reply.

In contrast, the Welsh were the most patient or ‘hard to get’ in the early days of a relationship, leaving it almost a week before getting in touch after a last encounter.

Dan Meader of TalkTalk Mobile, told MailOnline: ‘[Our] work with Debretts means that we’re able to go one step further towards helping out Britain’s daters mind their manners.'

‘Nearly 70 per cent of us know someone with bad phone manners - although only a fifth of us thought our own phone manners may be in need of improvement - so our top tips aim to help people weave their way through the web that is modern phone etiquette.’

Jo Bryant, etiquette expert at Debretts, added: ‘Mobile phones allow us to communicate instantly, with ease and spontaneity, but as the TalkTalk Mobile survey results show, consideration for others is essential for good mobile phone manners.’
