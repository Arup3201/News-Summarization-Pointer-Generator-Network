A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder after the death of a 10-month-old baby who was found unresponsive at a home in London.

The 31-year-old woman was arrested yesterday on suspicion of murder and has since been bailed, pending further inquires, to a date in mid-October.

The baby boy was found unresponsive last Friday at a house in Barnet and was rushed to a local hospital by the London Ambulance Service.

The Metropolitan Police confirmed that they had lauched a murder investigation  following the death of a baby in Barnet

He was then transferred to Great Ormond Street children's hospital in central London on Monday.

But he was certified dead later that day by surgeons who were unable to save his life.

An initial post mortem examination has been carried out by a pathologist and further tests are due to be carried out on the baby's organs to try and establish an exact cause of death.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'A murder investigation has been launched following the death of a baby in Barnet.

'Officers know the identity of the deceased and his next of kin have been informed of his death.

The baby was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, pictured, but later died. Further tests are required to establish a cause of death

'A post mortem examination held on Thursday at Great Ormond Street Hospital did not give a formal cause of death and further tests are required.

'On Friday, 5 September a 31-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of murder. She has since been bailed pending further enquires to a date in mid October.'

'Detectives from the Homicide and Major Crime Command are investigating and inquires continue.'
