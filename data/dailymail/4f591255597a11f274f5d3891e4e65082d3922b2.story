Laurent Blanc wants Chelsea’s player of the year Eden Hazard to join David Luiz as part of Paris Saint- Germain’s plans to conquer Europe.

The PSG coach went public on his desire to sign Hazard as his club  prepared to announce the £50million signing of Chelsea’s disaffected  Brazil international central defender, Luiz.

Chelsea also have a decision to make on Hazard (right) after Blanc admitted that he wanted to sign the winger.

The Paris St-Germain manager said: ‘Why do I love Eden Hazard? Because he is a player who eliminates.

‘We can discuss all of the systems, or a player’s  individual or collective qualities.

‘But a player who can eliminate three, four players at any time in a game is something else.

‘We do not know what to expect with these players. They destabilise the opponent.

‘We know we want plan A. But of course there is a plan B if he doesn’t come. There is also a plan C.’

With
 such seemingly unlimited funding, Blanc is under pressure to win the 
Champions League for the first time in the club’s history next season 
after  dominating the French league again last campaign.

PSG’s
 medical team flew  overnight to Brazil’s World Cup training camp where 
Luiz passed a medical assessment to join the Ligue 1 champions.

The £50m fee was agreed  with Chelsea and generous personal terms were successfully negotiated with the player.

The
 sale of Luiz, which was revealed by Sportsmail in later editions  
yesterday, is a massive gamble by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho as he 
attempts to build a team that can wrestle the Barclays Premier League 
title from Manchester City next season.

Gamble: Selling David Luiz, Roman Abramovich's favourite player, is a major risk for Jose Mourinho

Luiz
 is Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich’s favourite player and the decision 
to sell represents a fascinating move by Mourinho after he convinced the
 board they must cash in.

PSG,
 owned by the Qatar Investment Authority, certainly have the finances to
 conclude a shock move for Hazard too, and Blanc is prepared to pay 
another £50million to lure the Belgium international away from Stamford 
Bridge.

But
 UEFA’s financial fair play  regulations could prove a key stumbling 
block towards  a potential move for the  23-year-old, particularly given
 they have already splashed out £50m in the move for Luiz.

Chelsea
 have released veteran striker Samuel Eto’o, but are still hopeful of 
persuading  England midfielder Frank  Lampard to stay at the club.

Mourinho
 will be planning to use the Luiz cash to bring a star striker to the 
club with Atletico Madrid’s Diego Costa his main target.
