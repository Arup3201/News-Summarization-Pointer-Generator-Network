FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley said firms offering loans to people who can never afford to repay their debts must 'improve their standards or leave the industry'

The financial industry ‘lost its moral compass’, the head of the new City watchdog said today as he warned payday lenders to clean up their act or face being shut down.

The Financial Conduct Authority suggested a quarter of payday lenders could be put out of business as it took charge of the £200 billion consumer credit market.

Chief executive Martin Wheatley said firms offering loans to people who can never afford to repay their debts must ‘improve their standards or leave the industry’.

Citizens Advice today warned that a payday loan has become a ‘debt sentence’ for many trapped by irresponsible lenders. 

Under the new rules payday lenders will be banned from making repeated raids on customers’ bank accounts to fund their debts.

Compulsory checks will also have to be carried out to make sure people can afford to repay loans before they are offered.

Mr Wheatley told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Our concern has been that parts of this industry, not all, loan without doing any affordability checks and then loading costs onto people who simply cannot pay, and that's the part of the industry that we really want to take out, we want them to improve their standards or leave the industry.

‘We've said that up to a quarter could leave, I think the industry itself has estimated figures much higher than that, we'll have to see.

‘We'd like firms to rise to our standards, but if they can't then we'd like them to leave the industry, it's very straightforward.’

Payday lenders will also have to provide financial health warnings online and link to free debt help from today.

And the FCA is to consult on capping the total cost of a loan, to stop charges spiralling out of control.

Under the plans, a payday loan firm will be able to attempt to try raid a borrower's account using a recurring payment known as a continuous payment authority (CPA) twice.

Mr Wheatley defended the decision not to scrap the powers altogether, insisting payday lenders offer a service used by hundreds of thousands of people.

‘The difficulty with this industry is that consumers in the UK use this product, it's not a question that it's a complete rip off, people use it and have valid reasons for wanting short-term access to money.

‘Over Christmas, the Money Advice figures said a million people planned to access these sort of services, so one of the difficult questions for us is how we balance the fact that some people use and value this service against the fact that some people are abusing the delivery of it.’

He insisted that the FCA had a ‘proportionate and balanced response’.

But Citizens Advice warned lenders have not kept promises to freeze interest rates, warn about the cost of extending loans and offer free debt advice to customers struggling to repay their debts.

Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ‘A payday loan has become a debt sentence for many of our clients due to irresponsible practices by lenders. 

‘Consumers who are looking for a bit of money to tide them over need a fair and competitive market to engage with not one that seeks to exploit them.

‘The stern warning and tough rules from the FCA need to be followed with strong enforcement action.  Lenders found to breaking the rules and harming consumers should be immediately thrown out of the market.’
