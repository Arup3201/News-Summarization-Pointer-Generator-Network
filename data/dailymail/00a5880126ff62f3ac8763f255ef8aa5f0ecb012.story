Gloucester have appointed Ulster boss David Humphreys as their new director of rugby.

The 42-year-old former Ireland fly-half succeeds Nigel Davies at Kingsholm and will now seek his own backroom staff, principally a head coach.

Humphreys captained Ulster to the 1999 Heineken Cup, overseeing the Irish province's run to the 2012 final.

Not good enough: Nigel Davies was dismissed by Gloucester last month

Gloucester dismissed former Scarlets boss Davies last month after a lacklustre Aviva Premiership campaign, his second season with the Cherry and Whites.

Gloucester chief executive Stephen Vaughan secured the signing of Wales fly-half James Hook on Tuesday, moving swiftly on to complete the deal for Humphreys.

Humphreys won 72 Ireland caps in a 10-year stint with Ulster before moving into the coaching set-up first as director of operations then director of rugby.

Gloucester will task Humphreys with running the playing squad's infrastructure and strategy, handing much of the daily team preparation to the eventual new head coach.
