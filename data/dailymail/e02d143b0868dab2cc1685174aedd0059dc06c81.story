One of the first major studies of 'Flying Ant Day' has revealed that the nuisance outbreaks can occur anytime in the space of a month.

The Society of Biology asked members of the public to cover their mouths and keep a record each time they saw the pesky insects take to the air in their annual battle to find a mate.

Adam Hart, an ecologist and insect expert at the University of Gloucestershire, led the call to arms, and discovered that the outbreaks could come anytime over the period of a month.

It was previously assumed the ants synchronised their swarms to increase their reproductive chances, but instead of the 'Friday night' approach, is appears there is a more complex pattern at play.

More than 4,000 people responded to the survey across June and July, and their sightings reveal that even within a small town can have outbreaks on different days.

Hart told The Scientist: 'It’s really too early to tell but even a
casual glance at the data so far shows that flying ant emergence is a 
spatially and temporally complex event.

'The data so far 
suggest that there certainly isn’t a single ‘flying ant day,’ even 
within the same small town.'

The outbreaks occur when male ants and females - potential queens - head to the skies to find a partner.

By far the most common flying ants 
seen at the moment is the black garden ant, Lasius niger. The ants we 
see throughout the year are workers (sterile females), but flying ants 
are males and new queens undergoing their nuptial flight.

Sadly for the males, they die soon after, while the females go on to build new colonies.

Queens
can live for around 10-15 years and only mate once. Having mated, a new
queen will drop her wings then start her own colony. 

Once
she has dug a nest she will lay her first eggs, and use her wing 
muscles for energy until the first workers are ready to forage. Over the
next few years she will keep laying eggs and her colony will typically 
reach 5,000 workers, but some grow to have 15,000.

Hart added: 'These sorts of large scale data can only be collected if
you have a large number of observers, and this means that a "citizen 
science" approach is the ideal method.

'I was surprised to get quite so many 
responses from the public and quite so much press and media attention.

'So far this has led to well over 4,000 responses, and this 
tally increases daily.'

Despite its size, the black garden ant has a huge impact on our countryside, from improving soil to pollination and pest control. They are also important as food; many people are alerted to the presence of flying ants by the sound of feasting gulls.

The Society of Biology plans to make this an annual survey, to help understand how and why the timing of emergence changes year on year. Much of what we know about ants comes from experiments which scientists can perform. Collecting information about ant emergences around the UK, however, relies on lots of people submitting their records.

The Society of Biology is asking everyone who sees flying ants in 2012 to make a note of the time, date, location and weather conditions, and submit records through an online survey www.societyofbiology.org/flyingantsurvey.

Anyone who takes photos of flying ants can share them by emailing Christina Catlin-Groves (flyingants2012@gmail.com), or share on Twitter using the hashtag #flyingantsurvey.

Photos tagged ‘flyingantsurvey’ on Flickr will be also be uploaded to the Flickr group.
