‘Tis the season to be jolly... but apparently not if you're playing board games.

Research reveals nearly three quarters of Britons celebrating Christmas will play one this year. But while festive cheer may be the order of the day, sitting down to roll the dice is guaranteed to spark a row for four million Britons on 25 December.

Almost four million Britons squabble over board games at Christmas

The nation’s number one game - Monopoly - is the most likely to cause a family bust-up this year.

Nearly two million game players (46 per cent) claim tensions run highest in the race to bankrupt fellow players.

Following Monopoly in the poll, almost a quarter of families (23 per cent) will have a war of words over Scrabble.

And despite a title that suggests otherwise, Trivial Pursuit gets the blood of a fifth of festive players (20 per cent) boiling, making it the third most argued-over game. 

For those who want to steer clear of board game bust-ups, family friendly games include the more cerebral Chess, with less than one in twenty (4 per cent) fighting over the opposition’s moves.

Similarly, childhood classic Snakes and Ladders sparks the temper of just one in 20 players (4 per cent).

2.    Scrabble

3.    Trivial Pursuit

4.    Pictionary

5.    Cluedo

6.    Twister

7.    Guess Who

8.    Mouse Trap

9.    Chess

10.  Snakes and Ladders

Interestingly, it’s the younger generation who are most keen to forgo a night in front of the TV for some family board game fun on December 25 – three quarters (75 per cent) of 18-24 year olds will play this year ten percent more than people aged over 55.

Anita Naik, consumer editor of Vouchercodes.co.uk who conducted the survey, commented: 'Stepping away from the TV and playing a board game is a great way for families to spend quality time together.

'It’s inevitable that some games will bring out a competitive streak in people so make sure you set some fun additional rules that will diffuse tense situations.

'In my family we draw forfeits out of a hat so at points throughout the game whoever is in the lead has to do something funny such as sing a Christmas song – that way people will focus on the taking part.

'You could also pick up some affordable prizes to players for different merits such as the person who was the best team player or for the one who made the best move in the game.

'Alternatively try breaking into teams so whoever is winning or losing can’t be singled out.'
