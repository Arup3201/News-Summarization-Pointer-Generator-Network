A teacher shed nine stone after she was asked to leave a rollercoaster ride because she was too large for the safety bar to fasten.

Secondary school teacher Claire Pettigrew weighed 23st and was size 24 at the time of the humiliating episode.

She said: 'I tried desperately to pull the bar over my stomach but it just wouldn’t go down any further.

Claire managed to shed an astonishing 9st in just 18 months by overhauling her diet

'My cheeks turned bright red when the ride attendant told me to leave.

'I forced a smile onto my face and told the 14- and 15-year-old pupils I was supervising I was too scared to go on the ride. They burst out laughing.

'Luckily, they didn’t hear the real reason. When I got home I was too embarrassed to even tell my husband.'

Mrs Pettigrew, 27, of Glasgow, struggled with weight gain since childhood and had a habit of snacking on sweet treats despite her mother’s encouragement to eat healthily.

She said: 'I’d never been a skinny girl. After school I ate sandwiches and crisps before my mum and dad got home. I was always hungry.'

When Mrs Pettigrew was 18 she met her husband Martin, 32, a cleaner, at a nightclub.

But as she settled comfortably into her new loving relationship her overeating went from bad to worse.

She said: 'We got into the habit of having takeaways and meals out. Martin didn’t worry about my size and I felt comfortable enough not to focus on my weight.

'At work I’d spend breaks snacking on sweets, biscuits, crisps and thick cheese sandwiches.

'When we met I was a size 16 but when we got married three years later I was wearing size 24 clothes.

'Our wedding day was wonderful but even now when I look at the photos I feel sad that I was that big.'

Three years after getting married Mrs Pettigrew gave birth to her first child, Nathan, now two.

She said: 'By the time I had Nathan my weight had gone up to 20st. I became increasingly self-conscious. I was convinced everyone was looking at me.'

Two months after the rollercoaster incident, which occurred at the Lightwater Valley theme park in Ripon in October 2011, Mrs Pettigrew decided to turn her life around.

She said: 'Nathan was nine months old and was crawling around everywhere, I was struggling to keep up with him and was really struggling to catch my breath.

'I was seriously worried that I wouldn’t be able to keep up with him when he started walking. The thought was just too much to bear.'

Mrs Pettigrew joined Slimming World in January 2012. At 23st 3lb, the challenge was daunting.

In her first week she lost an impressive 9lb which spurred her into action.

She swapped unhealthy snacks of chocolate and cheese for healthier options.

Before beginning her weight loss 
journey, Mrs Pettigrew typically ate buttery toast with sugared coffee 
for breakfast, cheese sandwiches with crisps and chocolate for lunch, 
followed by a ready meal with oven chips for evening meal. She would 
snack throughout the day from a family-sized bag of chocolate.

Claire says she is now embarrassed about the amounts she used to eat

Today, she eats a cereal bar and coffee with sweetener for breakfast, with lean chilli or vegetables in homemade sauce for lunch, and stir fry or reduced-fat curry for dinner. She enjoys an occasional cup of lighter hot chocolate for a snack.

She said: 'I stocked up on fresh fruit and veg and lean meat. Luckily the diet I followed still allowed me to have big portions of pasta in a tomato sauce, so I never felt hungry.

Every time I felt like giving up, I looked at my son and reminded myself why I was doing it.'

In only 18 months she shed a massive 9st, bringing her down to 13st 12lb - a healthy weight for her 5ft 11in height.

She says: 'I’m ashamed I used to eat the amount I did. I would never eat all that chocolate again.

'Martin tells me how proud he is of me and I’m finally happy with the way I look.

'People used to say it was a shame I was so big because I was a pretty girl. I’m glad I will never have to hear those words again. I’m happy in my own skin and I no longer worry what people think.

'I love being able to wear figure-hugging clothes and most of all I’m proud that I can play and run around with Nathan.

'We recently went to a play park and I fitted into a ride there with no problems.'
