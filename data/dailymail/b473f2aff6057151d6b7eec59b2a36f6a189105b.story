The youngest patient in Britain to be fitted with a mini-defibrillator has been given a life-saving heart transplant.

Fifteen-month-old Carina Marcangelo suffered from 
cardiomyopathy, a disease that damages the heart.

She was just nine-months-old when she was fitted with an ICD
(implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), which gives the heart a shock if it goes into a dangerous rhythm.

Fifteen-month-old Carina Marcangelo underwent a heart transplant at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital in April. She is pictured with parents Nicole and Darren, and sister Emily

Cardiomyopathy, a disease that damages the heart muscle, meant her left ventricle had a thickened wall, which stopped it working as well as it should.

Carina was admitted to the Royal Brompton Hospital in October 2012 after she collapsed at home.

After a month in hospital, she was placed on the waiting list for a heart transplant and became the youngest patient in the country to be fitted with an ICD.

Following an agonising wait, in early April the Marcangelo family received the call they had been waiting desperately for, and Carina was taken to Great Ormond Street Hospital for the transplant.

Before the call, the family said they had prepared themselves for the worst.

Carina became the youngest heart implant patient in the UK after cardiomyopathy, a disease that damages the heart muscle, meant her left ventricle had a thickened wall, which stopped it working as well as it should

Carina's father, Darren Marcangelo, 40, said: ‘The doctors had told us they didn't know what to do next for Carina.

‘It is a horrendous position to be in, but we were never going to give up on her.’

During her nine-hour transplant surgery, Carina almost bled to death and doctors had to act quickly to stop the bleeding.

As a result, she ended up with a large blood clot behind her knee.

She was diagnosed after being admitted to the Royal Brompton Hospital in October 2012 when she collapsed at home. She was put on the heart transplant list after a month in hospital

Her parents faced an agonising wait to discover whether a heart would come up in time to save her life but they prepared themselves for the worst as she became sicker and sicker

Mr Marcangelo said: ‘They initially said there was no hope for her leg after the transplant. It was horrendous. We didn't cope very well with it.’

His wife, Nicole, 36, said: ‘It just felt like one thing after another and we thought “what's next?"’

The family said they were ‘so lucky’ a plastic surgeon came up and looked at Carina's leg and suggested a procedure worth trying.

The procedures to save her leg were successful and Carina now has blood thinning injections to her leg twice a day to help the recovery process.

In April she underwent a nine-hour operation to give her a new heart but she nearly bled to death during the surgery and developed a blood clot in her leg which nearly resulted in it having to be amputated

After a month-and-a-half at Great Ormond Street Hospital, the family were delighted to be able to return home last month.

However, their joy was short-lived as Carina was taken to Kingston Hospital at the end of May after suffering difficulty breathing and a high temperature.

Mrs Marcangelo said: ‘They said it would be a short stay while she had oxygen, but it was quite strange being back at Kingston, as that is where it all began. Kingston Hospital saved her life the first day she collapsed.

‘The day we left Great Ormond Street, a consultant said to us they were amazed Kingston had kept her alive because of her complex condition. Kingston is a fantastic hospital and has a brilliant team.’

Doctors managed to save her leg but she now has to have twice-daily blood thinning injections to help her recovery

A few days after she returned home, Carina suffered breathing difficulties and developed a high fever which meant she had to be readmitted to hospital but she has now returned home again

After being given antibiotics for a chest infection, Carina returned home to her family.

Mrs Marcangelo said: ‘Apart from the hiccup, life has been so amazing since we have been home but it is exhausting.’

After spending nearly half of her life in hospital, Carina is now enjoying little things such as seeing the clouds in the sky, feeling the wind in her face and watching the family's pet cat with fascination.

Mrs Marcangelo: ‘The first time we went out of the hospital after her transplant, it was like the first time she had seen the world.

‘Now we are home, we won't take anything for granted, even doing normal things such as doing the housework and food shopping.’

The family are very hopeful for Carina's new heart, with a recent biopsy showing no signs of rejection.

Mrs Marcangelo said: ‘If we could say anything it would be how much the transplant means to us as a family. It is amazing that we can come home and be a family again.

‘It would not have happened without that family who donated their child's organs.’

The family said they want to do their best to help raise further awareness about organ donation and will attend a fun run for Great Ormond Street Hospital at Battersea Park on June 9.

Mrs Marcangelo said: ‘It is such a sensitive subject and is very taboo. We are not saying you should sign your child up, we are saying just think about it. It is just to make sure people think about it and talk about it as a family.’
