Marouane Chamakh is back in contention as Crystal Palace return their attentions to the Barclays Premier League against Leicester on Saturday.

A Palace side showing a full 11 changes following the win at Everton lost 3-2 after extra-time to Newcastle on Wednesday night to exit the Capital One Cup at Selhurst Park.

Chamakh missed the defeat and the 3-2 win at Goodison Park with a hamstring injury and may be selected among the substitutes against the Foxes, with manager Neil Warnock insisting the players which began at Everton would likely return to start.

'Chamakh will be available,' Warnock said. 'He was very close to being available last weekend but we felt it was not worth the risk.

'There won't be many changes from Everton. At Everton we were fantastic, so I don't envisage many changes.

'But it's nice to look at the squad, the second group of players, knowing what you can bring into the squad.

'That was the pleasing thing last night, the way we played, we enjoyed it, we went forward whenever we could, we looked like we wanted to go out and play football in the cup.

'They all played really well against a strong Newcastle team. It showed we've got quite a good squad.'

Warnock was less than happy with the stadium announcement, made while the match with Newcastle was ongoing, that Manchester City would be the opponents in the fourth round.

'I made an enquiry after the game, because I was disappointed, if I'm honest,' Warnock added.

'I don't think it should have been announced. I don't know why it was announced and who announced it. I'm sure there will be some enquiries today.

'I felt it was out of order for both sets of fans, who just wanted to get on with the game.'

Asked if knowing City, 7-0 winners over Sheffield Wednesday, would be their next opponents with victory had affected his players, Warnock's response was sarcastic.

Warnock, with a smile, said: 'I think that's why they threw the last goal in, so they didn't go to Man City away. We heard the score.'

Leicester beat City's Manchester rivals Manchester United 5-3 last weekend and are seventh in the table with two wins and one loss in their five matches since promotion from the Championship.

'They've made the Premier League look quite easy, really,' Warnock added.

'I'm hoping they get a more difficult game on Saturday.'
