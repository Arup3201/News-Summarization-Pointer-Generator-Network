Disney really does make dreams come true, at least for one talented young performer who has become the first Australian to be a Disney Princess.

After moving to New York City as a teenager to pursue her dream of becoming a Broadway star, Sheridan Mouawad said that being chosen to play Princess Jasmine' in ‘Aladdin – A Musical Spectacular’ at Disney’s California Adventure was the opportunity of a lifetime.

'I grew up watching Disney movies as a child and looking up to all the Disney princesses. Suddenly I was given the opportunity to be one, which is such an amazing feeling,' Sheridan told Daily Mail Australia.

'As my background is Middle Eastern, having the opportunity to not only be a Disney Princess but to be Princess Jasmine is definitely a dream come true- my five-year-old self inside was jumping like crazy,' Sheridan said. 

It has been a long and exciting road for Sheridan, 22, who began ballet lessons at the age of three and landed her first professional performing contract with Universal Studios in Singapore at only 18, the start of a career which has seen her travel to dozens of international cities.

Sheridan, from Merrylands in Sydney's western suburbs, said that while she 'loves attention' and being paid to play dress-ups, she also values the adrenaline she gets from performing in front of an audience.

'I love knowing that you left a piece of yourself with every person out there, and knowing you had a part in taking them on an emotional journey,' she said.

While Sheridan's ultimate goal is to land a role performing on Broadway, she said that she has been cast in amazing roles which have taught her invaluable life lessons and how to adapt to different cultures.

'I was only 19 when I picked my whole life up again and moved to the Big Apple to live in a tiny dorm room with a budget to study at The American Music and Dramatic Academy,' Sheridan said. 

'Leaving a job and going back to school would have been one of the hardest decisions I have made, but one of the most rewarding as well.'

After landing a role with West Side Story, which saw her perform in Europe and on London's iconic West End Stage, Sheridan was offered a full-time role as Princess Jasmine, a moment which she calls one of the highlights of her life.

'It just honestly feels so special. Knowing that so many children all over the world idolise the Disney Princesses, you have the power to make those children’s dreams come true by meeting you,' Sheridan said.

As the first Australian to be given a title role as a Disney Princess, Sheridan said it was exciting to meet the cast and be the exotic 'foreigner'.

'Meeting the cast and knowing I was foreign kept a fun buzz throughout the contract,' Sheridan said.

'Everyone was excited because they had never had an Australian on the cast before and I was proud to be the first and make a great impression.'

In her role as Princess Jasmine, Sheridan said that one of her favourite elements of performing in the musical was riding Aladdin's magic carpet and seeing all the children in the audience respond

'When Jasmine comes down, children in the audience wave, and when Jasmine waves back and catches a little boy or girls eye, they begin to wave back passionately,' Sheridan said

One of the highlights of Sheridan's time with the musical was being a part of Disney's 'Make a Wish Foundation', which gives terminally ill children the opportunity ask Disney for a 'wish'.

'Children have requested to meet the cast of Aladdin, or take a photo with Jasmine and Aladdin,' she said.

'Knowing what these children are going through, having a hand in making their wish come true would truly have to be the most beautiful and heart-warming experiences I have ever encountered,' Sheridan said.

'Disney magic really does exist and it’s when you experience events like this.'

'When I saw this, it made me completely emotional and it never got old. I know I was changing a little boy or girls life with one special moment,' she said.

While Sheridan has now landed another iconic role in the hit Broadway show ‘Rock Of Ages’ in las Vegas, she said that her time as a Disney Princess was unforgettable. 

'I couldn’t feel more proud and blessed for where my hard work and perseverance has gotten me,' Sheridan said. 

'Disney actually is the happiest place on earth and has made one of my dreams come true.'
