Manufacturers hope the cigarette-like sticks, which contain tobacco, will appeal to smokers

HeatSticks are set to be launched in Japan and Italy this year

The tobacco giant behind Marlboro has developed a new type of e-cigarette which it claims could reduce the harmful toxins found in smoke.

Philip Morris International has spent more than £1.2 billion developing the electrically powered product - known as the Marlboro HeatStick - which heats tobacco rather than burning it.

It believes the device, which will be available in Japan and Italy later this year, produces less toxins than an ordinary cigarette.

The Marlboro HeatStick, pictured inside the iQOS pen holder, is heated to 350 degrees Celsius to create a tobacco-flavoured nicotine vapour. The pen is re-charged inside the battery, pictured behind the HeatStick, by plugging it into the mains using the USB connection and plug

The product, which looks like a cigarette, works when it is placed inside a holder – a device developed by an external company called iQOS.

This heats the tobacco to a maximum temperature of 350C (660F) to create a tobacco flavored vapour.

The holder can heat 20 'cigarettes' on a charge, and come with a mains USB charger.

While most e-cigarettes (pictured) deliver a nicotine hit they do not contain tobacco - unlike Marlboro HeatSticks, which do

While the HeatSticks bear a resemblance to e-cigarettes there is one major difference – tobacco.

E-cigarettes instead contain liquid nicotine, which is heated up and turned into a vapor that is inhaled or ‘vaped’ by the smoker.

Since the tobacco is heated up rather than burned, the HeatStick produces an aerosol instead of smoke.

Tommaso Di Giovanni, head of reduced-risk
 product communications at Philip Morris, said: ‘We are conducting 
extensive scientific studies to determine whether the HeatStick can 
support claims of reduced exposure to harmful constituents in smoke 
compared to smoking ordinary cigarettes.’

It isn’t the first time a product like this has been developed; heating technology was first introduced in the 1990s in the form of a cigarette called Eclipse but failed to catch on with smokers because they were difficult to use and didn't taste the same as a cigarette.

How do e-cigarettes work?

E-cigarettes are battery powered and contain a cartridge filled with nicotine. When the user inhales, the nicotine is drawn into an atomizing chamber, where it is heated and turned into a vapour. The vapour is inhaled like a normal cigarette and a nicotine hit is delivered to the lungs without tar or toxins.How do HeatSticks work?

The cigarette-like sticks are heated to maximum of 350 degrees Celsius in a hollow pen-like device to create a tobacco-flavoured nicotine vapour. They contain tobacco which is heated instead of burned to eliminate toxins found in smoke.

But manufacturers reckon the recent craze for e-cigarettes shows smokers are more open to dabbling in alternative products.

J. Brice O'Brien, head of consumer marketing for Reynolds who created Eclipse, said: 'Smokers then considered Eclipse to be a very foreign, very different, very novel concept in smoking, where today, compared to electronic cigarettes, tobacco heating cigarettes are much more familiar.'

Chief executive of Philip Morris, Andre Calantzopoulos, agrees. He said: 'Products like the HeatStick represent a potential paradigm shift for the industry, public health and adult smokers.'

Meanwhile e-cigarettes remain a popular alternative for many smokers.

So much so, that Philip Morris purchased UK-based e-cigarette maker Nicocigs for an undisclosed sum on Tuesday.

Nicocigs, founded in 2008 and based in Birmingham, is best known for its Nicolites brand.
