A woman murdered her  parents and buried them in  their back garden with the help of her husband – then told their neighbours and relatives they had moved to Ireland for the ‘good air’, a court heard.

William and Patricia Wycherley were each shot twice before being wrapped in bedding and ‘stacked’ one on top of the other under the lawn.

Their debt-laden daughter Susan Edwards, 55, and her husband Christopher, 57, buried them after watching the Eurovision song contest on a bank holiday weekend in 1998, the court heard.

Accused: Susan Edwards, 56, (left) and her husband Christopher, 57, (right) are accused of shooting dead her parents Patricia and William Wycherley, burying them and stealing from their bank account, while tricking relatives into thinking the couple were still alive

They then covered the grave with 
plants and spent the next 15 years tricking family members, neighbours, 
doctors and financial institutions into believing the Wycherleys were 
still alive.

Meanwhile they
 ‘cleaned out’ the Wycherleys’ bank accounts and continued to steal 
their pension and benefit payments, the court was told.

When they realised the net was closing in, the pair relayed a ‘carefully hatched and rehearsed story’.

Christopher
 Edwards claimed his wife shot her mother after Mrs Wycherley, 63, 
boasted about sleeping with him. Mrs Edwards told police her 85-year-old
 father had abused her as a child.

Prosecutor
 Peter Joyce QC said the defendants kept up the deception that the 
Wycherleys were still alive by writing ‘jocular’ letters purporting to 
be from the dead couple in response to cards or correspondence.

Shallow grave: The bodies of Mr and Mrs Wycherley were discovered wrapped in bedding in a makeshift grave in their back garden last October

They
 even managed to trick solicitors into allowing the sale of the 
Wycherleys’ home. Mr Joyce said: ‘They deceived and tricked everyone 
into believing that Susan Edwards’ parents, William and Patricia, were 
still alive.

‘They could 
then cover up the killings and continue to fund their own lifestyle and 
help to solve their financial difficulties out of monies that were 
continuing to be paid to the Wycherleys.’

The
 money – £66,000 from the sale of the house, along with £173,767.40 in 
pension and benefit payments – was ‘diverted’ into a joint account 
opened in the names of Susan Edwards and her mother after the May Day 
bank holiday in 1998, when the  murders are alleged to have taken place.
 Applications for bank loans and credit cards were also made in Mrs 
Wycherley’s name.

The 
‘reserved and reclusive’ Mr and Mrs Wycherley had two joint accounts 
holding £40,000 which were ‘cleaned out’ days after the murders. 
Nottingham Crown Court heard the defendants regularly travelled to the 
house in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, from their London home following 
the murders to maintain the garden.

Edwards posed as a nephew, telling neighbours the Wycherleys had moved to the seaside.

The
 court heard the defendants married in 1983 and had been in ‘severe 
financial difficulties’. They owed £160,000 to creditors when arrested 
last October.

Victim: William Wycherley prior to his death (left) and as a younger man (right). Christmas cards sent after his death said that he and Mrs Wycherley had moved to Ireland and he was enjoying a 'second youth'

Christopher Edwards repeatedly denied that the couple's actions had anything to do with money

The couple 
fled to France after receiving a letter from the ‘authorities’ 
requesting to interview Mr Wycherley as his 100th birthday approached, 
the jury was told. When their money ran out, Edwards contacted his own 
elderly stepmother to ask her for money and relayed a ‘carefully hatched
 and rehearsed story’.

He claimed his wife had been staying with her parents when she woke up to discover her mother had shot her father.

He said Mrs Wycherley then boasted she had slept with him, her own son-in-law – and her daughter shot her in anger.

But instead of going along with their story, the horrified stepmother contacted police.

The
 defendants were arrested after returning to the UK later that month and
 stuck to their ‘fatally flawed’ story, Mr Joyce said. Susan Edwards 
told police she shot her mother after severe provocation.

She claimed her father had abused her between the ages of seven and 11.

A
 post-mortem examination found the Wycherleys had been shot twice with a
 revolver, like one Christopher Edwards was known to have owned, Mr 
Joyce said.

Susan Edwards 
admits the manslaughter of her mother and both defendants admit 
obstructing a coroner in his duty by burying the bodies. They also admit
 stealing a credit balance but each denies murder.

The case continues.

The jury heard extracts from letters and cards purporting to be from the Wycherleys.

Oct 2005: Posing as Mr Wycherley declining an appointment at a chest clinic: ‘(I’m) feeling better, and I will be visiting with relatives over the next months: for that reason it is not convenient to make an appointment.’

Dec 2006: Declining a free pneumonia vaccine: ‘As I will be staying with relatives…I would prefer not to be sent letters offering me vaccines I will not want.’

Christmas 2007: Cards or letters sent by Susan Edwards to relatives claimed her parents had decided to tour Ireland ‘because of the good air’.

2009: Describing breaking the news to her father of his sister’s death, she wrote: ‘He can get quite confused and upset...he has never mentioned it again because it upsets him too much I think.’

2011: In a Christmas card to relatives about her parents travelling in Ireland, she said her father was ‘having his second youth’, adding: ‘It is good to see them with such zest.’
