If you were hoping for a little winter sunshine during this week’s half-term break, the prospects are not looking good.

From tomorrow, Britain will again be blighted by biting winds and frost, with an increasing chance of snow as icy gusts blow in from Scandinavia.

After the glorious weekend weather continued into yesterday, when much of the country was in sunshine, the mercury will plunge back towards freezing.

The half-term began as a blustery day for children in Cobb at Lyme Regis in Dorset, as the sea whipped up large waves

By Thursday, temperature highs will 
fall significantly below average to just 4C (39F), and will stay there 
throughout the weekend. Night time temperatures will fall as low as -4C 
(25F).

Forecasters say that parts of the east coast will be hit by snow  flurries that will blow in over the North Sea.

John Lee, of MeteoGroup, said: 
‘There’s only a risk of wintery flurries along the eastern side of 
England, where it will be windy and the temperature will be low.’

But by the end of the week coats and hats will be a necessity, as large swathes of the country will be hit by near-freezing temperatures.

Wednesday is expected to see a turn in the weather. Temperatures will drop to freezing, or just below, as winter continues to firmly hold on.

The average UK temperature will struggle to get above two or three degrees during the day from Wednesday, and night temperatures will hover around the freezing mark.

From Wednesday to Friday the country is expected to see mostly dry, but rather cloudy, conditions.

It will feel increasingly cold, and become quite windy in the south.

The western parts of the UK will see the best of any bright weather. 

However, the forecaster predicted it won't all be sparkling winter sunshine.

There is a weather warning for fog that is expected to descend upon the south west, London and parts of the east of England tomorrow, but that will clear.

And by the end of the week, there is a small chance of some light snow flurries across the east and north east of England, but the Met Office says they are expected to pose very little risk.
