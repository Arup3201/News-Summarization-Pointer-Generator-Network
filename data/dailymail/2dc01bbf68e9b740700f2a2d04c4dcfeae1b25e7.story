British drug mules Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly could be freed next year under a new law designed to empty Peru’s crowded jails of foreign inmates.

The head of Peru’s prison service, José Luis Perez Guadalupe, told The Mail on Sunday both women could apply for release under ‘the expulsion law’ once they have served a third of their sentences. 

They were jailed for six years eight months, starting from their arrest in August last year, so a third of their sentence would come in November 2015.

Mr Perez Guadalupe said: ‘This law was created for people who are not the big fishes, like those girls who are not in a criminal organisation.’

The drug mules, dubbed ‘the Peru Two’ are still hoping to be transferred home through Britain’s extradition treaty with Peru.

But Melissa’s father, Billy, said: ‘This is great in that it’s another route for her to come home. It’s also positive in that she wouldn’t have to do any time over here or, we understand, have a criminal record.’

Glaswegian Reid, 21, and McCollum Connolly, 20, from Belfast, were caught attempting to smuggle £1.5 million of cocaine out of Peru.
