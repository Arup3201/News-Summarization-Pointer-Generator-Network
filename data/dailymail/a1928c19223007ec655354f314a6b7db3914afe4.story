A pregnant mother whose unborn child has been diagnosed with a tumour is to carry on with her pregnancy - despite being told the baby has just one per cent chance of survival.

Lisa Tilbury, 22, was devastated after doctors broke the news at her 20-week scan that her baby had a 10p-sized tumour at the top of one kidney.

She was told she could terminate the pregnancy, but decided to not to despite the poor prognosis - and is now six months pregnant.

Lisa Tilbury, 22, has been told her unborn baby has just a one per cent chance of survival because it has a kidney tumour but she has decided to continue with the pregnancy

The only hope the family have of realistically saving the unborn child is expensive laser surgery, carried out in the womb by surgeons at a specialist hospital in the U.S. - at a cost of £300,000.

Ms Tilbury, from Bathgate, East Lothian, who also has a three-year-old daughter, Amy, said: 'I broke down when they told us, but this baby deserves a chance to live.

'A consultant told me the baby was very ill and that it had a one per cent chance of survival. It was devastating.

'A lot of people are telling me to get rid of it, but it deserves a chance. I don’t think they would understand unless they go through it themselves.'

The pregnancy was developing without problems until doctors at St John’s Hospital, Livingston, discovered the baby had fluid in its stomach at the crucial 20-week scan.

Ms Tilbury was sent to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and then referred to the Southern General in Glasgow, where she was kept in for further tests.

Ms Tilbury has been told the only chance of saving the baby is pre-natal surgery which costs £300,000

Doctors feared her baby might have caught a virus and needed a blood transfusion, but the results came back negative.

Ms Tilbury was then given an ultrasound scan, but when the sonographer stopped half-way through the scan she knew something was wrong.

She said: 'They were scanning me and I couldn’t see the screen. The nurse got her colleague.

'She had a look and then she stopped scanning. I was asking, "what’s wrong?" It was clear in the scan. It was about the size of a 10p piece.

'They did say the baby is very ill and it might not survive in the womb or after I have given birth.'

Ms Tilbury is now trying to raise the money required to go to the U.S. for surgery in a bid to save the baby. Image shows the scan prior to that which revealed the tumour

Although she is in her sixth month, it is still unclear what the baby’s gender is or whether the tumour is cancerous or just a mass of tissue.

Doctors are worried that it could be neuroblastoma - an aggressive form of childhood cancer.

Ms Tilbury and the baby’s father, Blake Carrington, 21, have separated, but they are supporting each other through the ordeal.

Mr Carrington said: 'It’s not hit me as much as my mum and Lisa. I don’t think it’s sunk in yet, not for me, anyway.'

The family has been desperately researching the condition and have contacted experts at Boston Children’s Hospital in America, who could perform laser treatment on the tumour.

The hospital is home to the world’s largest research enterprise at a paediatric medical centre, and could perform pre-natal surgery.

But the family has only three months left and they say they need to raise a staggering £300,000 to pay for the flights and the overseas treatment.

Mr Carrington’s mother, Helen Carrington, who has supported Ms Tilbury throughout the pregnancy, said: 'Lisa is distressed. The hospital is being very helpful.

'We have been speaking to a representative there, which is the same as a consultant here.

'We are doing research and getting information. No-one seems to know what it is. It would be great to find someone else in the UK that will know what it’s like.'

The family have also launched an appeal for the cause - which they have called Baby Carrington, Our Little Braveheart.

The family have organised several fundraising events and are urging readers touched by their story to come forward and help.

Ms Carrington added: 'We have not got that much time. But if anything happens before we manage to get to America, I’m going to put the money towards somebody else in a similar situation.'
