This is the makeshift barracks where thousands of troops will live while on guard duty at the Olympics.

The complex at Hainault, Essex, looks more like a prisoner-of-war camp than a military base.

Work on the grey metal accommodation blocks started four months ago. Now almost complete, they provide spartan living space, with washing and toilet facilities, for 3,000 Armed Forces personnel, some of whom have served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

From sand to soil: Troops arrive at the Olympic Army camp at Hainault Forest in Essex

Home sweet home: Tents at the camp which will house catering staff and supplies

Tents on the site house a catering area and a recreational centre where the soldiers can relax when off-duty.

Alongside the temporary portable homes is the more comfortable-looking Snoozebox Hotel, a larger unit comprising single and double rooms for 1,000 G4S support workers and civilian personnel.

The camp is protected by a wire mesh fence with white sheeting stretched across it for privacy.

Troops based on the G4S-controlled site are due to man X-ray machines, search visitors and monitor CCTV  at the Olympic Park.

New walls, please: Anti-terrorism fencing and security is erected at the All England Tennis Club in Wimbledon

But despite the Games beginning in less than two weeks, the camp  in the 250-acre Hainault Forest  Country Park looked far from finished yesterday.

One employee said construction had fallen behind schedule because of the poor weather, and work had been going on through the night.

About a quarter of the dormitory accommodation for troops is still to be completed.

Vast vessel: The Royal Navy's largest ship has been carefully manoeuvred into position on the Thames, where it will be used during the Olympic Games as a base for helicopters and military personnel

In action: The pair will be two of thousands who will be in Britain aiming to ensure that London 2012 is safe from terror attacks

Logistics: The men look across the London skyline and consider what faces them over the coming weeks

The wet summer has turned the area into a quagmire, but one soldier said: ‘We’re used to this. Some of us have been to Afghanistan and it can be really wet and muddy out there.’

Elsewhere, the All England Tennis Club’s complex at Wimbledon was receiving a security makeover, while a Rapier missile defence battery was deployed in Blackheath, London, near the site of the equestrian events.

Troops on duty for the Olympics should get the same £500 bonus being given to London Tube drivers, Labour demanded last night.

Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy called on the Coalition and disgraced security firm G4S to foot an £8.5 million bill to give the troops an extra Olympic payment.

He said all troops on Olympics duty – including the 3,500 being drafted in because of G4S’s failure to recruit enough civilian staff – should receive the same £500 bonus won by Underground drivers.

Demands: Troops on duty for the Olympics should get the same £500 bonus being given to London Tube drivers, MPs claimed

Work: Men continue to file in with items to prepare and install the missile launcher

Bus drivers have a similar deal for working through the Olympics after going on strike for the extra payments.

Mr Murphy said: ‘Just because our troops can’t strike, it doesn’t mean they should be ignored. Londoners and people across Britain won’t accept our forces being treated less fairly than Tube and bus drivers.’

Ministry of Defence sources said the department was looking at measures to recognise the Armed Forces’ Olympic role, but one said it would be ‘strange’ to pay troops extra for their Olympic work while their colleagues were on the frontline in Afghanistan.

The MoD has said that the thousands of additional servicemen and women being drafted in will be compensated for any expenses such as cancelled holidays.
