Apple is preparing to give the iPad a new split screen mode so users can run two apps at once, it has been claimed.

Video showing the feature has been leaked online - at it could be available in the next update of Apple's iOS software.

It allows the user to change the window size using a finger.

The update would allow the iPad to run two apps side by side. The feature is already in the latest beta version of the iPad software, according to one user who uploaded a video of it.

The feature allows the iPad screen to be split in two.

It is now known how the command will be triggered.

Using  two fingers on the screen, the apps can be resized.

Each app is able to work independently.

It is also expected to be simple to copy data between apps.

Expected to be unveiled in September when the firm is expected to unveil new iPhones and iPads, the move will be a major change to the way the iPad handles multiple applications.

However, the tablet will not be the first with the feature - and Microsoft even made the iPad's lack of split screen functionality the subject of a recent ad.

'iOS 8 is likely to supercharge the functionality of Apple’s iPad with a new split-screen multitasking feature, according to sources with knowledge of the enhancement in development,' claims the blog 9to5Mac.

'These people say that the feature will allow iPad users to run and interact with two iPad applications at once.'

The video shows the iPad simulator software splitting the screen, which can be dragged to resize it.

Current users can swap between apps, but can only see one on screen at a time.

The new feature is also likely to enable users to drag information - text or pictures, for example, between apps.

The blog also claims the feature may also be key to a larger-screened iPad, which Apple is actively developing for a launch either later this year or in 2015.
