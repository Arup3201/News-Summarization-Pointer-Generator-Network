Silvio Berlusconi watched girls dressed as nuns strip and perform a pole dance, a court heard yesterday.

The former Italian premier claims his bunga-bunga parties were ‘convivial dinners, with wine, food, talking and singing’.

But yesterday a young woman invited along to one of the notorious gatherings spoke of her shock at what she saw.

Model Imane Fadil, 27, was giving evidence at the trial of Berlusconi on sex and abuse of office charges. Miss Fadil also described how girls in AC Milan football kits undressed to their G-strings while another pair performed an erotic dance.

Dozens of other young women are due to testify, as well as actor George Clooney and footballer Cristiano Ronaldo.

Miss Fadil said that she had attended the parties – held in the basement of Berlusconi’s villa – in the hope of securing a job as a presenter on one of the media mogul’s TV channels.

Girls were apparently recruited by regional councillor Nicole Minetti, 26, a member of his political party, and paid to dance for him and his cronies.

Miss Fadil told the hearing in Milan of an evening in February 2010 at the villa in nearby Arcore. She said: ‘I saw Nicole Minetti and Barbara Fagioli [another guest] dressed in black tunics, wearing white headcaps and a crucifix and then they stripped off … and were left just in their underwear.

‘Another evening some of the girls were wearing AC Milan shirts. One girl, Iris Berardi, was dressed as [player] Ronaldinho … and she danced until she was left wearing a G-string.’

Miss Fadil said that the girls touched themselves and also allowed Berlusconi, 75, to touch them.

She added: ‘I went to the  parties because Berlusconi had promised me a job. I was shocked with what I saw.’

Miss Fadil said every time she went to a party there had been ‘guests taking their clothes off’.

She recalled one where TV hopefuls Roberta Nigra and Lisa Barizonte were dancing.

Miss Fadil said: ‘Lisa removed Roberta’s underwear, they then both began touching each other. Then Nicole got involved.’

She said that she had been given envelopes of cash but never stayed the night – though other women were very willing to do so.

Miss Fadil also revealed how Berlusconi showed guests a crude video of a former ally Gianfranco Fini who he had a bitter falling out with, sitting on a toilet adding: 'I have not spoken about this before because I was scared. He had it on an iPad in his office and Berlusconi made comments which were not very nice.'

Berlusconi has always denied anything untoward happened at the bunga bunga parties and insisted that they were 'convivial dinners, with wine, food, talking and singing' - although prosecutors insist the women were paid in return for sex and one of them was then 17 year old Moroccan belly dancer Karima El Mahroug.

Berlusconi is accused of having sex with Miss El Mahroug - in Italy the age of consent is 14 but paying for sex with a women under 18 is seen as prostitution with a minor.

Both he and Miss El Mahroug, who also goes by the name Ruby the Heartstealer deny the charge.

Besides the sex charge with Miss El Mahroug, Berlusconi is accused of abusing his office by using his influence as prime minister to have her released from custody after she was arrested by police for theft in May 2010.

He is said to have wrongly told police in Milan that she was related to then then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and should be released so as to avoid a diplomatic incident.

Miss Fadil also told the court that she had heard Miss El Mahroug had a 'compromising video' of Berlusconi, rumours of which have been circulating in Italy for several months but which as yet has not surfaced.

Though she told the court she did not stay after being offered the cash-stuffed envelope, Miss Fadil described how other women were more than willing to spend the night with Berlusconi and said: 'Several women were paid to have sex - there was a woman called Joanna and another from Guatemala.

'Those that spent the night were paid more and the girls were willing to do anything to stay there. It was all organised by Nicole Minetti.'

Last week it was revealed that Berlusconi had given Miss Minetti £50,000 towards her legal fees while he has also given a further £150,000 to twins Imma and Eleonora De Vivo who had been regular guests at the parties but he insisted the money were 'transparent loans.'

Miss Fadil also described to the court how Berlusconi had asked the Moroccan born model for diplomatic advice on dealing with dead Libyan despot Colonel Gaddafi.

She said:'I told him that the best thing to do would be to go and see Gaddafi as we Arabs can be a bit touchy. He also asked me about AC Milan (football club Berlusconi owns) and he said "What are we missing?" I told him a strong young player.'

The trial continues.
