George North should be stopped from playing rugby until the World Cup in September after suffering his third bout of concussion in four months.

That is the view of former Scotland full back Rory Lamont, who fears for the Wales and Northampton winger’s long-term health after revealing his own battle against depression as a result of multiple head injuries.

North was left unconscious in Friday night’s Aviva Premiership fixture against Wasps and Lamont, knocked out 12 times during his career, is convinced the 22-year-old has been ‘let down.'

The weight of impact required to cause a bout of concussion reduces the more times a player suffers head injuries. Yet there are indications that North could still play against Clermont Auvergne in the Champions Cup quarter-final on Saturday. ‘It’s a complete disgrace that it’s got to this stage,’ Lamont told Sportsmail. 

‘George has been let down. That a player can still be exposed to this at the top level is crazy. They’ve tipped him over the edge now because he’s had too many concussions in a short period of time. He should take six months out, but even then he will be increasingly susceptible.

‘I’ve got metal plates in my jaw, cheekbone and eye socket, but it’s the unseen damage that worries me. There are still moments during the day when I can’t remember my best friend’s name. I went through depression, irritability and lack of form after these knocks.

‘I nearly walked away from the game in 2008 and, if I’d had the same information that’s mainstream today, I probably would have. If the brain is gone, you’re just left with an empty vessel.’

North, who was concussed when playing against the All Blacks in November, remarked that ‘rugby is not tiddlywinks’ after he was knocked out twice against England last month.

‘There’s this standard bravado attitude,’ said 32-year-old Lamont, who believes there is a cultural problem that needs to be addressed. ‘George is right: it’s not tiddlywinks. But this is brain damage we’re talking about and it can lead to early onset dementia.

'Players don’t want to dig in and face up to the dangers. They have committed themselves to this career and they love it — it’s so much fun. There’s a wilful ignorance because you don’t want to accept the thing you love might end up killing you.

‘I know an England international who suffered a few concussions in one season and now, as a result, he suffers panic attacks. But he’s still playing because the thought of stopping is too scary. The money is coming in and he’s hanging out with his mates every day.

‘The players just aren’t educated: a lot of my friends are still playing and their knowledge of the long-term implications is shocking.’

North was unable to continue and Lamont thinks that he should be prevented from playing until the World Cup

North’s latest concussion occurred when he was caught by the knee of Wasps No 8 Nathan Hughes, who was shown a red card and will face an RFU disciplinary panel this evening. After the game Northampton issued a statement, saying: ‘North will continue to be monitored by the Saints’ experienced medical team throughout the weekend.

‘As with everyone in the squad, Northampton Saints place the highest importance on player welfare and as such North will see a specialist early next week for an assessment.’

Wales medical manager Prav Mathema has also been in dialogue with Northampton’s doctors over the weekend.

There was immediate concern for North after the incident and Hughes was shown a red card for the clash

Any subsequent decisions will be highly scrutinised, with North’s double blow against England becoming one of the most controversial incidents of the RBS Six Nations. 

The WRU were cleared of any wrongdoing after North was allowed to stay on the field but Lamont, whose countryman Tim Visser signed for Harlequins yesterday, feels the World Rugby body need to take a more pro-active stance.

Return-to-play protocols permit players to be available for selection within six days if they are symptom free, while boxers face a mandatory, 90-day stand-down if they lose consciousness for less than a minute. ‘We need to preserve George’s career and life after his career,’ said Lamont.

‘But I just don’t know if rugby is going to manage him properly. Even if he passes all the assessments, they are far too flawed. There will be great pressure to get him fit for the business end of the season but you’re playing with fire. He needs to be protected from his club and country. Independent experts need to make the decision.

‘Far too much faith is put in the protocols. When a player gets concussed it should be an absolute minimum of 21 days’ rest. There’s no way they should be playing six days later. A bruised leg doesn’t recover in six days and a bruised brain certainly doesn’t.

‘Because we can’t see a bruised brain, people don’t look at it the same way. It’s utter nonsense and business aspects are prioritised above player welfare. There is no room for error.’
