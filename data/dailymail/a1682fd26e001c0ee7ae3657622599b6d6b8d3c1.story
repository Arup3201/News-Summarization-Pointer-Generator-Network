She had never lost faith as the crown wobbled, never doubted her filly’s ability, and trainer Criquette Head-Maarek was emphatically vindicated on Sunday as Treve scorched to a two-length victory in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe.

The margin of victory from Flintshire may not have been as big as last year’s five-length procession in the mud but it was probably even more emphatic or, as the track announcer bellowed, ‘extraordinaire’.

Unbelievable, he could well have added as she sprinted clear of John Gosden’s third Taghrooda and Roger Varian’s St Leger hero Kingston Hill in fourth, both making excellent efforts from poor draws.

Taghrooda’s jockey Paul Hanagan thought he would win turning for home. He said: ‘I just saw this flash of Treve up the inside — she is some horse, isn’t she?’

Treve is one of the greats now but few who watched her crab-like gait in defeat at Royal Ascot in June or her fourth in last month’s Prix Vermeille — a performance that had vin ordinaire written all over it — would have put much money on her becoming the first back-to-back Arc winner since Alleged in 1978 and the seventh dual winner. 

This is a filly with ropey feet and a dodgy back who could not be ridden for six weeks in the summer as she rehabilitated after her Ascot setback.

Her 11-1 starting price reflected that. Minutes after her first win 12 months ago, bookmakers were handing out quotes of 2-1 that she would be back in the Arc winner’s enclosure.

Replacing jockey Frankie Dettori with Thierry Jarnet, at Head-Maarek’s insistence after Treve had been beaten in the Prix Ganay and Prince of Wales’s Stakes, was part of the masterplan.

Perhaps to assuage the hurt, 43-year-old Dettori had insisted last week that the 2014 Treve was a mere shadow of the 2013 model, all of which must have made the result yesterday hard to swallow, especially when a broken ankle meant he missed Treve’s first success here, too.

Dettori’s comments seemed to make Head-Maarek bristle with indignation as she promised to prove him wrong...and she did.

As Dettori passed the post in ninth on Ruler Of The World, it must have felt like a blow to the solar plexus. A later victory in the Prix de la Foret on Richard Hannon-trained Olympic Glory, in the colours of his boss and Treve’s owner Sheik Joaan Al Thani, must have been scant compensation but he was putting on a brave face.

Dettori said: ‘This was the Treve of old. Unfortunately when I rode her here (in the Prix Ganay) she wasn’t like that.’

But Dettori’s judgment was not too wild as Head-Maarek admitted Jarnet had initially recommended retirement for Treve after her Vermeille defeat. 

The trainer, who has now won three Arcs after first landing the race in 1979 with Three Troikas, said: ‘I want to say thank you to Sheik Joaan because he always believed what I told him.

‘A lot of people were saying Treve was no good and was finished and I asked him to have faith in me. It is not a surprise — she is the best.

‘In the Vermeille she was beaten but she did an incredible time in the (home) straight. I was sitting next to my Papa and he said, “Don’t rule her out of the Arc”.’

Displaced jockey Frankie Dettori had previously claimed that Treve was not the same horse anymore

Papa is Alec, 90, a four-time Arc-winning trainer himself, who still keeps an eye on his daughter’s stable.

He had convinced himself that the filly was still good enough to win and phoned his old friend Sir Peter O’Sullevan last week to advise the 96-year-old former BBC horseracing commentator to back Treve.

Interestingly, all the first four raced prominently throughout.

The hopes of Japan were dashed again and annoyingly Harp Star, the first of their trio in sixth, sped home from an impossible position.
