A seven-year-old girl from New York had her Christmas ruined by a Grinch who stole her dog, but thanks to a Good Samaritan, the young owner was reunited with her beloved pet.

Mia Bendrat was completely heartbroken after her Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Marley, was snatched by an opportunist dog thief on Christmas Eve.

But the crime was caught on camera and a campaign to catch the thief was launched by the family, police and the media.

A Good Samaritan subsequently saw a man trying the sell the dog and paid $220 out of her own pocket to buy Marley, a ginger spaniel.

The woman, Tena Cohen, took the dog to a vet to be scanned for a microchip and, as suspected, found that Marley belonged to Mia, whose Christmas had been ruined by his disappearance.

The emotional moment when Mia and her mother were reunited with Marley is shown by ABC News, on its website.

DNAInfo.com reported that Mia, her mother, Angie Estrada, and the mother's boyfriend all went to La Rosa Fine Foods at 176 
on Broadway in New York City's Washington Heights at around 10.30am Monday to pick up groceries for their Christmas dinner.

They would usually have someone stay 
outside with their pet, but that day they decided to all go in together,
leaving Marley tied to a pole outside.

The family were gone for about eight minutes, and when they came out, the pooch was gone. 

'Our world changed at 10 o'clock,' said Estrada. 'I was horrified, but I'm trying to hold it together for Mia.'

ABC later released 
CCTV footage of the dog being stolen from outside the store by a man wearing headphones.

Marley, who was a Christmas present for Mia two years ago, at first greets the man with a wagging tail.

But
as he detaches Marley's collar and then unties the lead from the pole, 
the dog's behavior changes. He clearly looks scared with his tail 
between his legs.

The man is then seen picking Marley up and casually walking off down the street. Passersby do not even notice the crime.

Realizing her dog had been stolen on 
Christmas Eve, heartbroken Mia, in interview with ABC News, questioned 
who would do such a thing.

Mia,
who described Marley as 'really fluffy' and 'adorable' said: 'I feel 
like they are going to get coal in their stocking... it's really sad.'

Speaking to the New York Post, 
Estrada said that her daughter was so distressed over losing Marley that
she would not even trim the tree

Her mother asked anyone who may have 
bought Mia's dog to return it. 'We'll pay you,' she pleaded on TV.

Luckily for the family, Tena Cohen 
was at the right place and the right time. The Good Samaritan told the 
New York Post that at around 1.30pm Monday, she was on her way to the 
Union Square when she heard a man yelling, 'Dog for sale!'

The woman described the pooch looking
nervous and sad which led her to believe that it was stolen.  Cohen 
offered the man holding the animal $100 in exchange for the spaniel, but
was told that it was not enough.

Cohen said that the man posing as the spaniel's owner looked high on drugs. He told her that he paid $3,200 for the pet and had it for years.

The woman then went to get more cash and returned with $220. After a brief negotiation, Cohen managed to convince the suspected thief to sell her the distraught pooch. 

Cohen took the animal to a vet, who checked it for free and found a microchip. She also contacted the group Cavalier Rescue USA, which ultimately helped reunite Mia with her beloved pet.

'I can’t believe a grinch would steal our Marley,' Estrada said. 'But the grinch didn’t win.'

Mia added, 'I’m not going to let Marley go now, no matter what!'

The suspected dog thief, identified 
as 29-year-old Brad Bacon, has since been arrested on a grand larceny 
charge. He entered a not guilty plea, claiming that it was a case of 
mistaken identity.

Even though Assistant District 
Attorney Jamie Kleidman asked for $7,500 bail, Bacon was released 
pending his next court date on March 11, the New York Post reported.

Mia's mother was stunned by the judge's decision to release Marley's suspected kidnapper.

'He could go and do this again anywhere else in any neighborhood,' she said.

According to the Post, just three days before police say Bacon stole the spaniel, he was released from jail for allegedly scamming a pair of Manhattan deli owners earlier this month.

On December 2, the 29-year-old allegedly approached the owner of Energy Kitchen on West 17th Street posing as a refrigerator repairman, and later demanded $255 for a deposit on his 'work.'

Half-an-hour later, Bacon went into another Energy Kitchen several blocks away and allegedly pulled the same scam, walking away this time with $188.
