A hardy grandfather who spent six days camped out on a windswept seafront for a sought-after beach hut is celebrating today after finally getting the keys.

Keith Duell, 68, didn't move from his spot at the head of the queue at Avon Beach, Christchurch, Dorset, since he set up camp there on January 2.

To keep warm the pensioner wrapped himself up in four layers of clothing and blankets to maintain pole position for the only hut to come up for a permanent lease.

Patience: Keith Duell, 68, is overjoyed after queuing for six days on Avon Beach, near Christchurch, Dorset, to secure a beach hut

Coveted: The beach huts at Avon Beach. One is Mr Duell's until September and he can renew if he so desires

He said: 'It was well worth the wait in the end and I got what I went for.

'My wife is pleased and my grandchildren are thrilled.

'All the time I was there by myself 
it was very quiet but it livened up a bit on the last night when other 
people started to join the queue.

'It was great to get home though and have a nice hot shower.

'In the end it was a doddle. I was 
really well looked after by the people who worked down there who kept 
bringing out coffee and cakes for me.

'I was treated very well indeed. The 
weather wasn't too bad either. The first thing we will do is personalise
our beach hut a bit and get a little fridge in there for the beer.

'We can't wait to use it and we really are over-the-moon.'

He sat in a deckchair and read books and chatted to passers-by in the daytime, while at night he moved into a one-man tent and endured near-freezing temperatures and rain.

His wife Christine visited him every day, bringing homemade soup, while other family members came with his evening meals of fish and chips, and pizza.

Keith's patience was rewarded at 9am today when the administration office for the beach huts opened for business.

He paid Â£850 in order to use the 6ft by 4ft 
wooden hut from April to September but, crucially, it will be his until 
he chooses to give it up.

Stoic: Mr Duell occupied himself by reading and chatting to those who passed by

Afterwards Keith, a farmer from Burley in the New Forest, Hampshire, returned home to have a hot shower and catch up on some sleep.

He said: 'Christine and I love it down here and our grandchildren often use the beach in the summer.

'We are delighted to now have a beach hut which we will get plenty of use out of.

'I was lucky with the weather as it didn't rain much and it was quite mild during the day.

'When I was in my tent I would often hear people walk past and say things like "he must be mad".

'My family brought me meals like pizza and fish and chips and Christine came down here every day with hot soup.

'Everyone here has been so hospitable and really thoughtful.'

Mr Duell used a nearby public 
toilet for washing facilities and enjoyed spotting wildlife, like foxes at night and seals in the sea.

Martin and Jackie Hiscock, from Christchurch, joined Keith in the queue over the weekend to claim second spot.

They were able to gain one of the 17 beach huts that are available on a 
six-week let over the summer and have put their name at the top of the 
waiting list for a permanent hut.
