A spurned lover who doused his ex-girlfriend in petrol and set her on fire when she dumped him has been jailed for 19 years.

Damion Sheldon, 42, of Dudley, West Midlands, attacked Louise Pilkington, 32, after struggling to cope after their nine-month relationship ended.

The arsonist went to her home in nearby Rowley Regis in the early hours and poured petrol through the letterbox before covering her in the fuel and setting it alight - in front of a nine year old girl.

Sheldon then walked off as flames ripped through the house - while a sleeping 13-month-old baby was in the house. Police reported the baby momentarily died from smoke inhalation before being resuscitated by firemen.

A court heard he set her on fire in scenes described by neighbours as like 'something from a film' on December 2 last year.

Witnesses told police they even heard Louiseâ€™s skin sizzle as they tried to put out the flames which engulfed her head and body.

Sheldon was unable to come to terms with his partner jilting him, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard during a week-long trial.

He texted her and said 'thanks love. You have destroyed me,' before taking his revenge, it was said.

Prosecutor Hugh O'Brien-Quinn said during the trial Sheldon was 'consumed by anger and self-pity' because he could not accept the relationship was over.

The court heard the nine year old girl sprang into action and got Ms Pilkington to drop to the ground and roll while as she became a human fireball.

She also tried to remove her burning clothes and watched in horror as flames tore through the house.

Detective Constable Andy Barnsley, who investigated the case for West Midlands Police, said: 'This was a horrific crime committed out of pure malice at having been jilted by his partner.

'It is a measure of Sheldon's character that he went to set fire to his ex-partner's home in the dead of night and, when disturbed by the woman, he doused her in petrol and set fire to her in front of a young child.

'But this horror wasn't enough for Sheldon who then coolly walked into the house and set fire to the family home where a baby was sleeping.

'Like a coward he then ran off in an attempt to evade justice and when captured, tried to deny any knowledge of the offence blaming his actions on alcohol.

'It is thanks to the woman's quick thinking, the girl's help and the actions of neighbours and the emergency services that this was prevented from becoming a tragedy.

'I am satisfied that the courts realised
the sickening nature of Sheldon's crime and have handed down a fitting 
sentence. I am certain that this will come as some comfort to all those 
affected by the fire.'

Sheldon had been making threatening calls to Ms Pilkington from 7.26am on December 1 which became more menacing as he got drunk.

He claimed during his trial he planned to kill himself that day but instead executed his catastrophic plan.

Ms Pilkington screamed out to neighbours that a baby was in the blazing building and urged them to focus their efforts on rescuing the tot inside, who was being choked to death by the deadly fumes.

Three men managed to smash their way through the window with a sledgehammer before firefighters battled their way into the property and rescued the child.

The baby was rushed out of the house and passed to other firemen who performed CPR for five minutes and brought the child back to life.

Louise has recovered 'remarkably' well from 16 per cent burns to her face and body, the trial was told.
