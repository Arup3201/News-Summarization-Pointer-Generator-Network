Britain's fittest grandmother has set a new world record in weightlifting just one year after she took up the sport because her local swimming pool was closed as result of council cuts.

All-action Lindsey Gowland, 57, played basketball to a national level as a teenager and then took to the water after turning 40.

She won a European gold and World silver medal at Masters level but was forced to give up competing when two of her local pools were shut down in 2009.

Super-gran! Sports-mad Lindsey Gowland shows off her muscles with this deadlift

The mum-of-four - who works as a sports lecturer and lives in Kingswinford, West Midlands - was then introduced to dumbbells by her colleague Martin Beastall at the end of 2013.

Lindsey initially lifted the weights to keep fit but soon realised she was good enough to enter the Midlands Championships in Worcester in October last year.

After qualifying with ease she then went on to win three gold medals in her first ever British Championships in Stafford in February. 

Lindsey took home first place in the deadlift, squat and bench press categories when she competed in the 63kg weight class and 55 to 59 age grouping.

Incredibly, she set a world record of 121kg in the deadlift as well as a European best in the 60kg squat and a new British record with 43kg in the bench press. 

Lindsey, who lives with her PE teacher husband Ian, 58,  admitted she doesn't look like a typical weightlifter.

Mum-of-four and grandmother-of-three Lindsey weighs 9st 9lb and was introduced to weights by a colleague

The 5ft 7in grandmother-of-three, who weighs 9st 9lb, said: 'I used to swim three or four times a week with a club but they closed down the one pool and a couple of years later they closed down the pool we moved to because of council cuts. 

'Martin got me into weights. He has had a go at it in the past and he looked at what I was lifting for swimming training and said I had a good chance of competing.

'He asked if I fancied giving it a go and I just thought, "why not?"

'When I first started training I was doing sessions at Dudley College, where the gym is mostly used by students.

'Lots of them used to look at me and think 'I bet you're not going to lift much' and I think they were quite surprised to see I could pull the weights I can pull.

'I never thought of myself as someone who would be able to lift heavy weights. It has really been so unexpected.

'I am reasonably tall but I am not a big person. I certainly don't look like the stereotypical weightlifter.

'But had it not been for the pool closing I think swimming would still be my main sport.'

Lindsey has now got her sights set on beating her global competitors when she enters the World Single Lift Championships in Telford, Shrops., in June this year.

The sports lecturer - who has four grown-up children Ian, 34, Emma, 33, Amy, 26, and Kelly, 25 - is also targeting the world record for the squat which stands at 65kg.

Lindsey often cycles as part of her fitness routine

She added: 'I had lifted weights in the past but only for conditioning to support swimming.

'I virtually had to re-learn my technique because when you weight train for fun you can get away with slightly less technique but when you compete it's very strict.

'I couldn't believe it when I broke the world record, I think there was a Russian woman who held it before me. I have lifted 125kg in qualifying but I just couldn't quite hang on to it in the finals.

'I want to work towards the squat world record. I need to get another 5kg on to the 60kg (European record) which I think I can achieve by June.

'I won't know who is turning up until the day of the world championships but there could be people from all over the world in my age group so it will be a challenge.'

Lindsey grew up in Lancashire before moving to the West Midlands in 1976, where she met her husband, Ian.

All four of her children have caught the fitness bug and her only son Ian is the captain of the Swedish national rugby union team after he emigrated there with his wife.

The fitness fanatic only weight trains once a week but also plays netball and swims an average of 3,000m every week.

And Lindsey hopes her success will show other people that they can keep active and strong as they get older.

She added: 'When you look at others lifting big weights who are older than myself it shows that you do not have to get weaker with age,' she said.

'Just because someone gets older it does not mean they can't do lots and lots of different things.

'It is all about high impact stuff, they have done studies that prove if you do high impact sports where your feet are coming off the ground then muscles, bones and joints stay stronger for longer.

'You lose strength and fitness with age but you don't have to lose it as quickly.

'I would like to think I feel younger and could give the college students a good run for their money in a lot of sports.'
