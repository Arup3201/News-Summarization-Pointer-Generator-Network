Mail ordering a bride is an ever growing business where desperate divorcees shell out thousands to fulfill their dreams of having an 'ideal' wife. 

For the women in countries like Ukraine who sign up to meet a western man, it's an opportunity to escape from poverty in their homeland.

But the trade off is a marrying a man likely to be much older than they are - and in some cases, who wants a live-in maid more than a wife.

Big business: Jodie Marsh investigates mail order brides in her latest documentary for TLC 

Regrets: The former glamour model admits her own marriage for a TV show was a big mistake

It's this 'quite sad and desperate' situation that Jodie Marsh investigates for her latest documentary for TLC.

The former glamour model is no stranger to unconventional marriage. She once tied the knot with a stranger for a TV show, something she now bitterly regrets. 

She said: 'My big day was a big disaster. My experience of marriage is horrendous and a joke. I got married as part of a TV show, it is my most embarrassing moment of my whole life.'

So for the 35-year-old to be left feeling sad and baffled by the mail order bride business shows just how seedy it can be. 

Via the documentary, Jodie meets men from America and the UK so desperate to find love, they are willing to pay to travel to the other side of the world and take a chance on a woman they barely know.

She joins a coach trip organised by one international dating agency who charge men almost £3,000 a time to travel to Ukraine. Once there, they spend a week on organised speed dating events where they hope to meet the woman of their dreams.

Disillusioned with American women: Divorcees Randy, 60, left, and Jerry, 53, are both seeking wives abroad

Not seeking a bread winner: Andrew, 44, from Wales said he wants a wife who 'doesn't want to be a man' and believes he has more chance of this in Ukraine where the women have more traditional values

Many of the men are divorcees desperate for another chance at love and disillusioned with western women. They are seeking women like those in Ukraine who have more traditional values about a women's place in the home. 

They include financial adviser divorcee Randy, 60, from Florida, who tells Jodie: 'I think America is evolving for the worst. It's almost like a woman doesn't need a man anymore.'

Jerry, 53, from Virginia, another divorcee, agrees. He explains: 'I've not had any issues meeting women but I've had a tough time meeting the right woman. The women in Ukraine are totally different to American women. They are more attentive and appreciative, they are not competitive with men.'

Andrew, 44, a civil servant from Wales, tells Jodie he feels the same about women in the UK.

He said: 'You don't want a woman who wants to be a man - who wants to be the big bread winner and drive a fast car.'

Not a sightseeing coach trip: The men aboard have paid nearly £3,000 each to take the journey to Odessa organised by an international dating agency who introduces them to Ukrainian women 

Not all the men Jodie meets on the coach trip are ageing Lotharios. One of the hopefuls is 26-year-old Eldon, a pharmacist from Kansas.

He's a virgin who thinks American women aren't attractive. 

He said: 'The women in America don't dress up or do their hair, they just wear sweatpants. It's disappointing they are not tying to attract any male attention at all.' 

Those on the trip Jodie joins are wooed by the story of the dating agency's founders. They are American Mark Davis and his Ukrainian wife Anna who have been married for years after meeting through an international dating agency. They have a happy relationship despite a 25 year age gap and now help other people follow in their footsteps.

Mark said: 'Everyone wants what we have. I tell men they have to have face to face introductions because you can't download a wife.' 

Anna said they organise their week-long trips with dating events so the men are not 'buying a wife' but 'trying to win a woman's heart'.

Found love: Mark and Anna Davis met through an international dating agency and now help other couples do the same thing (for a price)

Anna reveals to Jodie what life was like before she married Mark and moved to America - she used to have to shower outside in the snow and earned £62 a month 

Another success story: Wayne Denton, 57, from the West Midlands, met his wife, Luliia, 32, in Ukraine

It's not difficult for them to find attractive, young women to sign up for their speed dating nights - which are conducted with the help of translators.

Anna tells Jodie that for many young women in the Ukraine, the future is bleak and they are lucky if they can earn $100 (£62) a month. 

Her mother tells Jodie that she was delighted her daughter was given a new life in American thanks to meeting Mark through an international dating agency. 

She said: 'I was very happy when she left. There is nothing good for young people in Ukraine. There are no good guys, just drug addicts and alcoholics. I'm glad she met Mark. It's better than if she stayed here.'

It's this dream of a new life that inspires many of the girls to marry a man decades their senior.

It's estimated that 15,000 women a year are entering the U.S. thanks to international dating agencies. 

As with Mark and Anna, it worked out for Brit Wayne Denton, 57, from the West Midlands, who met his wife, Luliia, 32, in Ukraine. Despite spending £10-12,000 on dating agencies and travel in order to have a relationship with her, he says he doesn't feel like he bought her because they fell in love and have been happily married for four years.

Hoped for a fairytale ending: Katarina from Russia thought she would live happily ever after in America after she became Frank's mail order bride

Nightmare: But Katarina, pictured today, told Jodie she became Frank's slave and punch bug

Jodie concludes that their relationship 'may have started as an online transaction but it has turned into something real and wonderful.'

But not everyone she meets has lived happily ever after as a result of a being a mail order bride.

Katarina moved to Atlanta from Russia after meeting her ex-husband Frank through an international dating agency.

Once they were married, she said he became 'cold and distant' and treated her like a slave.

She said: 'I stayed in the house and cooked and cleaned for him and that was it.'

Things then got even worse when he became abusive. 

'He hit me and I felt from that point it wasn't going to get better. I wanted to go back to Russia,' Katarina told Jodie.

But when she told Frank she was leaving, he cut his own arm with a knife and then rang the police to accuse his wife of attacking him. The charges against her were eventually dropped and she got a restraining order preventing Frank from going near her. 

When he broke this and approached her armed with a gun, he was shot dead by the police.

While traumatised by his violent killing, Katarina is also relieved, believing if he had lived, he would only have gone on to buy another wife and make her life hell.
