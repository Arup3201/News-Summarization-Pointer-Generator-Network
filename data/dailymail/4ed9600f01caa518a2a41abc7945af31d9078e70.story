A businessman who stabbed to death a cousin of Ranulph Fiennes with a pair of scissors in a crazed attack has denied murder, claiming he was insane at the time.

James Fiennes - second cousin of Arctic explorer Sir Ranulph - was having a drink in an upmarket tapas restaurant when a man went 'out of his mind' and repeatedly plunged the blades into his body.

As assailant Nicholas Hunter was tackled by a former police officer, the 49-year-old victim collapsed to the floor. He underwent emergency surgery in hospital but died five hours later.

Nicholas Hunter, 37, today pleaded not guilty to murdering Mr Fiennes and to threatening to kill Thomas Ollsen on April 22 last year at the restaurant in Mortlake, south west London.

He does not deny the attack but his defence rests on the claim he was 'insane' when he launched himself at his victim.

Speaking during the hearing at the Old Bailey, Judge Wendy Joseph said: 'His defence is he was insane at the time.

'If this is not accepted in relation to the murder charge he will bring up the question of diminished responsibility.' 

Dressed in a black suit, white shirt and blue tie, Hunter of Rodenhurst Road, Clapham, appeared via video link from Broadmoor Psychiatric Hospital.

He pleaded not guilty to both charges in a loud voice.

Prosecutor Zoe Johnson said: 'He has been judged fit to plead. A trial date has been set for March 16 which is expected to last seven days.

'It is clear there are complex mental health issues.

'The defence will not be making large admissions, apart from the odd point of discussion. The trial will rest on issues of mental health.'

Psychiatric reports are being prepared on behalf of the prosecution and defence and will be ready before the trial.

Judge Joseph told the defendant: 'You will be tried on March 16 of this year. Until then you will be kept at the hospital you are being treated at.'
