A great-grandmother who led police on a 27-mile chase at 10mph has been banned from driving again after knocking down a pedestrian on a zebra crossing.

Caroline Turner, 79, had her licence taken away in 2011 after leading officers on the low-speed chase for more than an hour through Essex.

She was only stopped when patrol cars formed a rolling road block on a dual carriageway - with one officer even jogging beside her car, telling her to pull over.

Turner, who has six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren, was banned from driving for a year  and fined £100 after admitting driving without due care and attention at Colchester Magistrates' Court.

During the pursuit, she had never gone above 20mph - and had told the officer jogging alongside her car: 'There's nothing to discuss. I'm going home', the court heard.

She had also ignored blue sirens, swerved into oncoming traffic and driven the wrong way around a roundabout - forcing other motorists to take evasive action.

Scene: Now, the widow, who regained her licence in 2012, has had her driving privileges taken away once again after knocking down a pedestrian at a zebra crossing in Butts Green Road (pictured) in Hornchurch

And now, the widow, who regained her licence
 after her initial penalty was reduced to just eight points, has had her driving privileges taken away once again.

This time, she failed to stop after knocking down a pedestrian at a zebra crossing in Hornchurch, Essex, in the same blue Ford Fiesta she had been driving during the low-speed chase.

Turner, from Gidea Park, east London, whose husband died in 2011, was banned from driving for another year following the incident last month.

Road block: During the low-speed chase in October 2011, Turner was only stopped when patrol cars formed a rolling road block on  the A12 (pictured) - with one officer even jogging beside her car, telling her to pull over

She was also ordered to pay £220 to the injured pedestrian at Romford Magistrates' Court.

But speaking after the hearing, the 
pensioner vowed to get back behind the wheel as soon as possible - 
saying: 'I have every intention of driving the car again, so there.'

Turner was also fined a further £165 for driving her blue car after the accident, and ordered to pay a £130 fine and victim surcharge.
