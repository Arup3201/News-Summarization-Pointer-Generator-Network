The Duchess of Cambridge is being cared for by an elite medical team led by two top royal doctors.

The Queen’s current surgeon-gynaecologist Alan Farthing and his predecessor Marcus Setchell are both at Kate’s bedside – and are both expected to play key roles throughout her pregnancy.

Royal births are traditionally overseen by only Her Majesty’s incumbent gynaecologist, but the involvement of both men in this case is a sign of the level of concern for the health of the Duchess and her unborn child.

Consultant Mr Farthing, 47, is the former fiance of murdered television presenter Jill Dando and took up his role in the royal household in 2008. This is the first royal pregnancy since his appointment.

His predecessor Mr Setchell, 69, has been treating Kate for her severe morning sickness, and the two men are expected to work closely throughout the pregnancy.

Mr Setchell was the royal surgeon-gynaecologist for 18 years and cared for Sophie, Countess of Wessex, delivering her two babies, Lady Louise Windsor, now nine, and Viscount Severn, four.

The Countess collapsed and was close to death when Lady Louise was born prematurely in 2003, after the placenta ruptured the lining of the womb. Mr Setchell also led the medical care following her ectopic pregnancy in 2001.

Concern: Kate, pictured last week at an event in London, has been experiencing acute morning sickness

Relief: Prince William smiled as he left the hospital after visiting his wife yesterday evening, and issued a statement which said Kate was 'continuing to feel better'

Grandparents-to-be: Kate's parents Carole (left) and Michael Middleton (right) are thought to have spent time at their daughter's bedside at the King Edward VII Hospital

Devoted: The Duke of Cambridge was photographed on his way into the hospital to pay Kate a second visit yesterday

He also performed the Duchess of Cornwall’s hysterectomy in 2007 at the King Edward VII Hospital, where the Duchess of Cambridge is now being treated.

In recognition of his work, the father-of-four was awarded a personal honour by the Queen in 2004 when he was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.

When Mr Farthing took over the prestigious role in 2008, he became one of the youngest doctors to treat the royal family.

He was reported to have met the Duchess last year after her wedding to Prince William.

Mr Farthing qualified as a doctor in 1986. He became a member of  the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1991, and a fellow in 2003.

Expert: Consultant Mr Farthing, 47, is the former fiance of murdered TV presenter Jill Dando

In 1997, he became a consultant gynaecologist at St Mary’s Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Imperial College, London.

He is a specialist in gynaecological cancer care and an internationally recognised expert in keyhole surgery.

Mr Farthing went on to open his own private Harley Street practice and works as a consultant at two teaching hospitals in London, Queen Charlotte’s in Shepherd’s Bush and St Mary’s in Paddington – where father-to-be the Duke of Cambridge was born in 1982.

Prince William and his brother Harry were delivered by Mr Setchell’s predecessor, the late Sir George Pinker, who delivered nine royal babies between 1973 and 1990.

Mr Farthing was engaged to Crimewatch presenter Miss Dando when she was murdered in 1999, five months before they were due to marry. The couple met at a dinner party in 1997 and announced their engagement in 1999.

Miss Dando was shot dead on  her doorstep in April that year  and her murder remains unsolved.

Just two months before her killing, she had spoken of her hopes that she would start a family with Mr Farthing, saying: ‘Maybe it’s old-fashioned, but I think it is important that children growing up can see two people there who love them and love each other.’

In 2001, Barry George was convicted of the killing and sentenced to life imprisonment, but his conviction was overturned on appeal and he was finally acquitted of murder in 2008.

Mr Farthing married hospital doctor Janet Stowell, who is 14 years his junior, at a small civil ceremony in 2008 and the couple had a son last year.

Security: Police were seen guarding the entrance to the private hospital in central London, where the pregnant Duchess is being cared for by royal doctors and experts

Announcement: Press and photographers gathered outside the London hospital after learning that Kate Middleton had been admitted to be treated for acute morning sickness

Close sisters: It is thought Kate's younger sister Pippa Middleton may be chosen as a godmother
