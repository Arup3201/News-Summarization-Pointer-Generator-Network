A word of warning to those who write personal notes to Pope Francis: He might just call you back.

Francis has already charmed the masses with his informal style, simplicity and sense of humour.

But a handful of strangers have gotten the treatment up close, receiving papal phone calls out of the blue after writing him or suffering some personal tragedy.

So the Catholic faithful are being warned: Be ready, especially if the landline rings.

Down to earth: Pope Francis has been surprising Catholics who write to them by personally calling them back

The 76-year-old Francis has a fondness for making calls the old-fashioned way, using land lines and placing the calls himself, often surprising recipients by simply announcing: 'It's the pope.'

After his election in March, Francis reportedly called his newspaper stand in Buenos Aires to cancel his daily delivery and his shoemaker to tell him not to bother with papal red leather loafers but to keep making his regular black orthotics.

The receptionist at the Jesuit headquarters in Rome thought he got a crank call when Francis phoned two days after being chosen pope looking for the Jesuit superior.

Francis has since called an Italian 
man whose brother was killed and a Colombian woman who works in Rome to 
thank her for a book.

After another random phone call from 
the pope this week, Italy's leading Corriere della Sera daily offered 
etiquette tips for the lucky recipients, proposing conversation starters
 and no-go areas on its front page Friday.

Stefano Cabizza, 19, from Padua, was the recipient of this week's papal phonecall after he left a letter for Francis at a Mass he attended

Beppe Severgnini, a noted humorist and Corriere columnist, suggested:

Severgnini also said even though Francis is fond of using the informal 'tu' in conversation, stick with the formal 'lei' but don't overdo it with exaggerated titles like 'magnificent.'

The recipient of this week's call, a 19-year-old student Stefano Cabizza, was quoted by Corriere as saying that Francis had told him to refer to him with the informal 'tu,' noting that 'Even Jesus and the apostles used the "tu".'

Mr Cabizza said he received the call after leaving a letter for Francis following his Mass at Castel Gandolfo on August 15.

He declined to say what he had written.

Finally, Severgnini advised people not to be worried about what to say.

'Just be natural,' he wrote. 'If he wanted to get bored, he would have called a government minister.'

Catholics in Italy shocked to answer the phone and hear: 'Hi, it's the Pope'

Listen first, then talk, and if the conversation permits, ask the soccer-mad Francis about the recent friendly between Italy and Argentina.

Always ask how Benedict XVI is doing. 'It'll make him happy,' Severgnini noted. Francis frequently refers fondly to his 86-year-old retired predecessor who is living on the other side of the Vatican gardens.

Avoid touchy subjects like Vatican policy or scandal.

Don't ask for any favours.
