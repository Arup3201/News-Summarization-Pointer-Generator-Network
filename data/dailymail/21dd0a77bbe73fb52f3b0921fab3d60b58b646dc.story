These incredible photographs show dogs hard at work in the most dangerous job in the world - clearing mines in the war fields of Afghanistan.

The mines are a legacy of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s and children are particularly vulnerable to the blasts when they go out to play or tend to their herds of cattle.

Mine Detection teams work with the highly-trained dogs, typically Belgian or German Shepherds, to find and neutralise the lethal explosives in the Namak Ab District of Afghanistan.

The heroic dogs are from the Afghan Mine Detection Center and funding comes from government donations around the world and international charities

The dogs are selected as puppies based on health and their fixation on a rubber ball, which is used as a reward for them during the mine-hunting sessions

The humbling and inspirational pictures were taken by Craig McInally, a 40-year-old former US Army bomb disposal expert who has been working in explosive ordnance disposal and mine action since 1999.

Craig has served in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, El Salvador, and Nigeria and has been stationed in Afghanistan since January 2014.

He said: 'Some mines are intentionally designed with minimum metal to make detection difficult.

'Dogs can search much faster than a person with a detector, especially in areas where mine contamination is low. This is particularly helpful in reducing the total size of a suspected area.'

Devices found in Afghanistan: (From the left) The Italian TC-6 antitank blast mine - minimum metal and hard to detect- the Russian PMN-2 antipersonnel blast mine and finally a Russian PMN antitank mine, perhaps the most abundant mine on Earth

The mines are often buried several inches into soil, making them extra hard to detect

The dogs are used because they can normally find mines much more quickly than humans can, even if they have a detector

They are selected as puppies based on health and their fixation on a rubber ball. This rubber ball is the reward for all their hard work.

The handler will start the dog in a warm-up box, then show the dog where to start based on wind direction and previous cleared areas.

The dogs then know to sniff along in a straight line searching for the explosives. When the dog reaches the end, it is called back and their progress is marked with coloured flags.

The process will continue until all the fields are cleared of mines.

After the mines are found they are destroyed in a controlled explosion.
