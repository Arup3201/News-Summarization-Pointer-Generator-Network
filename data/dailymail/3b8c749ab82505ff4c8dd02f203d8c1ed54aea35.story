Doctor Terence Burley had a six-year affair with a patient he allgedly seduced in his surgery

A family doctor seduced a grieving patient at his surgery before embarking on a six-year affair that ended in a cat fight between his wife and his mistress, a tribunal heard.

Dr Terence Burley, 64, continued to treat Christine Turner and her family after the romance began in 2003 and even cared for her dying estranged husband Richard during his battle with stomach cancer.

The cheating doctor left wife Jane and four children to be with his lover, but when their relationship broke down in early 2009, Mrs Turner, 62, was arrested following a public spat with the medic’s wife.

Dr Burley, who gave evidence at The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester today, where he is accused of misconduct and faces being struck off if found guilty.

The medic fell for his patient of 20 years after she sought consolation from him over her mother’s death at the Minster Medical Practice, in Peterborough.

Mrs Turner claimed her doctor seduced her at his surgery then ‘pestered’ her into continuing the relationship, calling her up to 15 times a day.

‘There was a particular morning where a travel blanket was laid on the floor,’ she told the hearing earlier this year.

‘He asked me to sit on the floor on this rug. We were the only ones there.

‘Obviously I did because I felt very vulnerable being on my own and I didn’t think he was going to request any further.

‘He asked me to take my top off and he asked if I would like my breasts caressing. He asked me if I would like oral sex.

‘I didn’t say yes but I didn’t refuse because I was actually frightened because I knew his conduct as a GP and I didn’t know what his personal life was like and how he would react.

‘I didn’t know what would happen to me if I refused.’

Mrs Turner told the panel these meetings continued at the doctor’s surgery where he would ask her to touch and caress his private parts.

‘And with no emotional and no feeling that happened because I just wanted to get in and out of the surgery,’ she said.

Later the couple would meet at Christine’s late parents’ house for sex sessions.

At
an earlier hearing, the MPTS panel found Burley had engaged in a 
‘consensual sexual relationship’ during three periods between 2003 and 
2008, but ruled Mrs Turner, known as ‘Patient A’ in the hearing, was 
‘emotionally vulnerable’ when the affair started shortly after her 
mother’s death.

Her 
husband, Richard, was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer in 2005 and
was living with her and her teenage son, Alex, in her late parents’ 
home and Burley cared for him in the final phase of his life.

Charges: Dr Burley was found guilty of misconduct at a tribunal today following his on/off affair with a patient

Despite
the GP’s denials, the panel found that a sexual relationship did 
continue between 2005 and 2007 as Christine had claimed.

Burley
then told his lover he had left his wife and asked if she still wanted 
him at a dinner party with friends in December 2007.

The
couple moved in together and lived ‘to all intents and purposes as man 
and wife’. But the relationship broke down in early 2009 when Burley 
returned to his wife.

‘On the day that I left, Patient A absolutely tore me to pieces because I had switched off the financial input,’ he said.

The
affair came to a definitive end in January 2009 when a ‘violent’ 
cat-fight erupted between Mrs Turner and the doctor’s wife at the 
Burleys’ home in Peterborough.

Patient
A was arrested the following day and interviewed by police. She was 
bailed before later being told no charges would be brought. She then 
made her complaint to the General Medical Council.

Previously,
Dr Burley had suffered fractured ribs and a broken nose after he and 
Patient A's school-age son became embroiled in a brawl in 2008.

He was then caught accessing the teenager's medical records when he was no longer his GP.

He
later said it was ‘a moment of madness’ sparked out of fear because he 
had previously been assaulted by Alex, receiving a broken nose and two 
broken ribs, the tribunal heard.

Dr
Burley faced allegations of pursuing and engaging in an emotional and 
sexual relationship with a patient over three periods between 2003 and 
2008.

He admitted 
conducting an on-off affair but denied pursuing the woman and was 
cleared of the charge. He said the relationship developed ‘by mutual 
agreement’.

Mrs Burley forgave her errant husband and they renewed their wedding vows after 38 years of marriage in May 2009.

History: Dr Burley had been the woman's family's GP for 25 years at the Minster Medical Practice in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire

Dr
Burley told the panel it was ‘love at first sight’ when he met Jane at 
University, and they married three years later in 1971.

On
the day they renewed their wedding vows, Jane wrote on her blog: 
‘Today, TKB and I are renewing our vows after 38 years of marriage.

‘And
they said it would never last... that we were too young. I was an 
aspiring drama student at Guildhall, and he was a medical student at 
Bart’s. But we knew that we were soul mates.’

Speaking
of their reconciliation on her blog, Jane Burley, who spent time as a 
mature student in Oxford, said: ‘The ceremony to renew our wedding vows 
was very moving.

‘I 
remembered the reasons why I had agreed to do this which were profoundly
deep-seated. Over the past thirty years, I had raised my brood and 
rediscovered my academic confidence by going to Oxford as a mature 
student in my fifties.

‘I
remembered the anxious questions from friends upon hearing that I 
intended to take up my place at Oxford: “Is your husband going with you?
How will he cope, I mean, who will prepare his meals?”

‘Well,
as I discovered, ladies, beware, if you are reckless enough to go off 
to study in the dreaming spires, someone else will offer to “steam his 
pudding” for him, whether he likes it or not!

‘So much for the “sisterhood”, yet another myth.’

GP: The Minster Medical Practice in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, where Dr Burley was a partner

Dr Burley wept as he told of the damage of his actions and promised the panel he would not be unfaithful to his wife again.

When asked why, he had fallen for Mrs Turner he said: ‘Because she was the exact opposite [of my wife].

‘I
think at the time, despite the fact she had been through bereavement 
processes on two occasions, she had a love of life, a vivacity, a very 
much can-do approach to things.’

‘It’s had an absolutely devastating effect on my family. I can understand where they are coming from as well,’ he said.

‘I
think my overall view of if the same situation came again I would get 
in my car and drive as far north or as far south as I could and keep 
driving.’

The panel also
found a number of significant errors in Burley’s clinical practice 
relating to his treatment of eight patients between 1999 and 2009, which
he said he has since addressed.

The medic was cleared of several charges relating to him pursuing the relationship and Christine’s vulnerability.

He was also cleared of making numerous misleading and dishonest statements in documentation in relation to the two patients.

Dr Burley, of Harewood Gardens, Peterborough, was a partner at the Minster Medical Practice from 1980 to 2009.

He has since worked as a salaried GP at the Botolph Bridge surgery, in Peterborough.
