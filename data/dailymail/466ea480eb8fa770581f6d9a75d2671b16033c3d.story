A trip that started with Gareth Southgate singing Saido Berahino’s praises ended with a similar theme as England’s Under-21s extended their winning spree.

Before jetting out to Lithuania and Moldova last Thursday, Southgate had spoken about how impressed he had been to see Berahino knuckle down after a dip at the end of last season to recapture the sparkle he emerged 12 months ago.

Those words were not misplaced. Berahino ensured England did what Southgate wanted, scoring twice in a 3-0 win over Moldova that secured an eighth consecutive win for their head coach and give him confidence ahead of Friday’s draw for the Euro 2015 play-offs.

Man of the match: Berahino 

With Harry Kane completing the scoring, it was a satisfactory night and it was fitting Berahino was the key man. Southgate’s first match in charge of the Under-21s last September – against Moldova – was settled by a goal from the West Brom striker, so who better to bookend the campaign in Group One?

Southgate, understandably, sported a content smile at the final whistle but there will be no standing back and admiring the job: dangers lurk in the play-offs and they will have to step up another level if they are to ensure this colourful journey ends in the Czech Republic next June.

Games in this tournament often throw up unusual experiences but it going to be a while before Southgate’s squad sample another coach ride like the one that took them from Chisinau, where their base had been, into the heart of Transnistria, 43 bumpy miles away.

Aside from the many goats and cows that were casually grazing on the grass verge of a three-lane highway, they then had to cross a border patrol – complete with armed soldiers standing guard – to get into one of Europe’s last communist outposts.

The unusual journey had no effect on the way England began the contest. Southgate made five changes to the side that had been successful in Lithuania last Friday but those selected kept to the passing principles that their head coach is has been determined to implement.

With Swansea’s Tom Carroll, who was captain for the night in place of the rested Jack Butland, pulling the strings alongside Jake Forster-Caskey and Will Hughes, England were on the front foot from an early stage.

Moldova had not conceded a goal at home in four games during this qualification campaign but, within 16 minutes, that record had been shattered as Berahino, who had a shot blocked moments before, rose to turn Nathan Redmond’s cross beyond Alexei Koselev’s reach. 

Given how briskly England had started, with Redmond and Berahino darting down the flanks and confusing the Moldovans by switching positions with one another, it was a surprise that they did not add to their lead before the interval.

If anything, there were guilty of a little complacency, as two moments of hesitation in defence allowed, first, Vadim Rata then Igor Dima to fire shots at Jonathon Bond’s goal that forced the England keeper to take action.

But as was the case in Lithuania, England stepped things up in the second period and they got breathing space in the 51st minute when Harry Kane supplied an inch-perfect ball to Berahino, who confidently did the rest, rolling his effort into the far corner of Koselev’s goal.

Two almost became three in the next attack but, this time, Berahino’s lob was too high after he had been sent scurrying away by Kane again. Berahino had another attempt shortly after but Koselev was equal to it, as he was when Kane unleashed a thumping effort from 18 yards.

Kane, however, would not be denied and having scored the winner against Lithuania, he finally got in on the act in the 84th minute, thrashing an angled drive past Koselev. Job done, then. It will only be fully complete, though, if their winning run includes the play-offs.
