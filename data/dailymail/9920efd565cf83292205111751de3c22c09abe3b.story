Convicted child abusers will be forced to wear tracking devices upon their release, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has promised.

Paedophiles will be equipped with GPS ankle tags so police can track their whereabouts after they have served their prison sentence.

The new scheme will be rolled out across Britain early next year, the Ministry of Justice confirmed today.

Promises: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling pledges to put GPS tracking tags on convicted paedophiles upon their release

Chris Grayling expressed his 
'horror' over the Jimmy Savile case saying no child should ever be 
ignored when asking for help.

After the recent scandals of Jimmy Savile and the Rochdale child sex ring he promises to ensure that child protection services, local authorities and police work together and receive proper training to deal with child sex abuse.

He said: 'It is a tragedy every time a child’s trust is trashed, their vulnerability exploited and they are harmed by the adults who should be looking after them.

‘Protecting our children must be an absolute priority.’

The Ministry of Justice will be rolling out the new tracking system across England and Wales in April 2013.

Repeat offenders believed to be of potential risk of harming members of the public, such as child sex offenders, will be forced to wear ankle tags similar to those used to monitor curfews.

The GPS tags will be used in addition to the current system where a person convicted of sexual abuse is put on the Sex Offenders Register through contacting the police within 72 hours of their release from prison.

Convicts must give their name, date of birth, home address and national insurance number as well as details of any vehicles they own.

According to the Home Office, the compliance rate is around 97 per cent. Convicted sex offenders who fail to register with their local police are fined and may face a jail sentence of up to five years.

Professions with responsibility for the wellbeing of children; head teachers, doctors, youth leaders, sports club managers and others, including land lords, are notified of the existence of a local sex offender on a confidential basis.

UK police also use the Violent and Sex Offenders Register (ViSOR) which includes all registered sex offenders, people jailed for more than 12 months for a violent offence but also innocent people with no convictions which are thought to be at risk of offending.
