Police say a baby found crawling across a busy four-lane street in northern Utah after his 7-year-old sister took him out of his crib is safely back home.

The driver who rescued the 1-year-old boy about 5:45 p.m. Friday returned him to his mother and called police in Brigham City, 60 miles north of Salt Lake City.

'As the driver got closer she realized it was a baby crawling across the road in the number one lane,' Lt. Dennis Vincent told KSL5. 'She picked the baby up and located a residence where she thought the baby belonged.'

The station adds there was also a report of a trucker blocking traffic to protect the crawling baby.

The unidentified mother told police she was resting and had put the infant in a crib to sleep.

Police say her 7-year-old daughter took the baby out to play and he somehow got out of the backyard.

They say the baby crawled less than a block when he was found in the lane closest to the sidewalk.

Police say charges are unlikely, but the case has been turned over to the Division of Child and Family Services.
