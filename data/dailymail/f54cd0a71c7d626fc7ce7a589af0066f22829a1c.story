Gwyneth Paltrow is known for her strict diet and rigorous exercise regime. 

But it seems that the famously controlled star is finally loosening up - and real women out there will breathe a sigh of relief after reading her latest Goop post.

The mother-of-two, who recently split with husband Chris Martin, said: 'Those of you who have read goop for a long time know that we try to do well by our bodies, our kids, and the environment as much as possible but we make allowances for real life, too. 

Go Gwyneth! The A-lister, who swears by a strict vegan lifestyle, has opened up on her Goop blog about how pizza, a cigarette at a party, a perfect martini and a daily glass of red wine can make a week more pleasurable, or a night out with friends more fun

'Not only is any concept of “perfection” untenable (and maddening), but it's not so enjoyable, either. 

'Pizza, a cigarette at a party, a perfect martini, a daily glass of red…these aren’t “cheats” or “indulgences” - these are just moments that can make a week more pleasurable, a night out with friends more fun.'

Tome: Gwyneth may  have written an entire book on her healthy lifestyle but proving she's a down-to-earth Hollywood star, she admits that she allows herself treats

Gwyneth was a trailblazer for the vegan lifestyle she - and now many of her Hollywood pals -advocate. 

After a gruelling schedule and lapse of overindulgence two years ago, Gwyneth was left feeling fatigued and faint and a trip to the doctor later revealed that she was anaemic, vitamin D deficient, and that her stress levels were sky high.

Her doctor prescribed an elimination diet banning coffee, alcohol, sugar, eggs, wheat, meat and processed food to clear out her system and help her body heal - and she got everyone else on board, including her children and husband. 

So stringent is her approach to diet she once admitted that her whole family can at times feel hungry because she will not allow them to eat carbohydrates like bread, pasta or white rice. 

However, after ‘consciously uncoupling’ from his marriage to Hollywood actress Gwyneth, Chris Martin relinquished the vegetarian lifestyle that came with it and is now once again a carnivore.

Feeling confident: Gwyneth was a host at the AmfAR gala in LA on Wednesday night where Chris Martin received a rousing introduction by his ex

The 37 year-old British star let slip about his change in diet during an interview with Steve Wright on Radio 2.

‘I am not really vegetarian. I eat meat. I was vegetarian for a long time but for various reasons I changed.

'My daughter [Apple, 10] has been a vegetarian since she was born. I keep getting tempted to go back but I don’t eat too much meat.’

The pair separated earlier this year and Chris was linked with Hunger Games actress, Jennifer Lawrence.

They have, however, reportedly split already. Chris Martin made his first public appearance since his split from Jennifer  - with a little help from his estranged wife Gwyneth Paltrow.

The Coldplay singer, 37, was a surprise performer at the AmfAR gala in LA on Wednesday night where he received a rousing introduction by his ex.

Paltrow hosted the event and kicked off the night by bringing Martin and his band mate Jonny Buckland on stage to perform the band’s hit songs Paradise and Viva La Vida.

She to the crowd that Martin is the 'father of the year,' according to E!.
