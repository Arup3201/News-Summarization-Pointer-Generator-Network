A British businessman who spent four 
months without charge in a notorious Hungarian jail following the 
collapse of his failed timeshare company is to appear in a Budapest court 
today.

Michael Turner, who is charged alongside his former business partner, was extradited under a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) in 2009 and spent weeks living in 
appalling conditions.

He faces fraud charges following the collapse of a 
failed timeshare company alongside Jason McGoldrick, 39, from Plymouth, Devon.

Trial: Jason McGoldrick and Michael Turner are facing a fraud trial relating to a timeshare business

Their Budapest-based company collapsed
in 2005 and Hungarian prosecutors used EAWs to detain them, alleging 
the company’s creditors were the victims of fraud.

Mr Turner, 30, has told how he was led
through a busy airport in handcuffs on a dog-style lead when he was 
first extradited on November 2, 2009.

The businessman, from Corfe Castle, 
Dorset, was imprisoned for four months at the Budapest Penitentiary 
Institute, where he was kept in his cell for 23 hours a day.

Unable to speak the language, and with
no warm clothes, he was only allowed on to a caged roof terrace in 
temperatures of -20C for an hour a day and was only allowed one shower a
week, he said.

He was released, with no explanation, 
on February 26 2010 - having only been interviewed once by police - and 
returned to Britain.

He later hit out at the British 
extradition system and said judges should be given more power to test 
the evidence in cases before individuals are extradited under the EAW.

Mr Turner and Mr McGoldrick are 
expected to appear in court today for a day-long procedural hearing, 
ahead of a trial which is due to start in April.

Both men deny wrongdoing.

The UK’s extradition procedures have 
come under the spotlight in recent months amid growing disquiet over the
US-UK treaty and the use of the EAW.

Jago Russell, chief executive of Fair 
Trials International (FTI), said: 'Michael was the victim of a shocking 
misuse of Europe’s fast-track extradition laws and suffered appalling 
treatment during the four months he spent needlessly in a Hungarian 
jail.

'The time for talking is over: the UK Government must now reform our flawed extradition laws.'

The campaign group has called for 
reforms of the UK’s extradition arrangements, saying had these changes 
been implemented, Mr Turner’s 'ordeal could have been avoided'.

The proposed measures include giving 
British judges the power to halt extradition until a case is 
trial-ready, as well as the power to refuse extradition where the 
requesting country is not the appropriate place for a trial to take 
place.

FTI has also called for the courts to be allowed to seek further information from the requesting state before extradition.

Means-testing for legal aid in all 
extradition cases should also be abolished and the fixed one-week 
deadline to appeal against extradition under a European Arrest Warrant 
extended, the campaigners say.

And they have called for British nationals or residents to be allowed to serve any sentence in the UK.

Today’s court appearances come just 
hours after retired British businessman Christopher Tappin was taken 
before a court in El Paso, Texas, following his two-year battle against 
being sent to America to stand trial.

A number of other figures in 
high-profile cases are also fighting extradition to the US, including 
23-year-old student Richard O’Dwyer who is accused of breaking American 
copyright laws.

Janis Sharp, the mother of computer 
hacker Gary McKinnon, said he was 'unable to control the terror that 
consumes his every waking moment' as he fights extradition over charges 
he hacked into US military computers.
