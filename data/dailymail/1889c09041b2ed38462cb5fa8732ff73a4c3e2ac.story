Oliver Hiscutt, 2, died after being misdiagnosed

A toddler died from a bacterial throat infection after his GP sent him home with Calpol.

Two-year-old Oliver Hiscutt had complained of a sore throat and was given the paracetamol- based painkiller on the advice of his doctor and NHS Direct.

But they had failed to spot he was suffering from Streptococcus, a bacterial infection that is experiencing a surge in Britain.

It escalated into a fatal abscess that ruptured a major blood vessel in Oliver’s throat.

He was eventually admitted to hospital but died from a ‘catastrophic bleed’ two days later.

At an inquest, assistant coroner Sara Lewis said she would write to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt calling for better guidelines on how to spot Invasive Group A Streptococcus, which was ‘very difficult to diagnose’.

The court heard the infection is on the rise and could prove fatal when left untreated. Paediatric consultant Dr Catherine Lenton told the hearing: ‘There used to be an epidemic where thousands of children would die, but now we are going through a surge and there are no national guidelines on Invasive Group A and its high mortality rate. It is on the increase and higher than we would usually expect.’

Oliver’s parents, chartered accountant David, 34, and Julie Hiscutt, 35, wept as they listened to the evidence at Heywood Coroner’s Court. The court heard their son was a ‘healthy and happy’ boy who had only been to the doctor for minor illnesses.

But on September 21, 2012, Oliver awoke crying.

Mrs Hiscutt, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, told the inquest that he pointed to his mouth to show where it hurt.

After days of worry, Oliver's parents took him to a GP, fearing he had meningitis, but were told to give him Calpol

‘He didn’t seem himself, but no worse than a cold and at that stage he was still eating, but not quite as well as normal,’ she added.

Oliver developed a rash on his stomach and his parents called NHS Direct, which suggested giving him Calpol and told them it was most likely a virus. Mrs Hiscutt said: ‘Over the course of the week he was still not himself. He was very quiet. He was not our usual boy.’

On September 24, Mrs Hiscutt took Oliver to their GP fearing he had meningitis, but was again told to give him Calpol. After showing no significant improvement and developing a red tongue, Oliver was admitted to hospital on September 30.

He was initially treated for viral tonsillitis, but doctors later realised it was a bacterial ‘strep’ infection.

He was put on intravenous antibiotics and showed signs of recovery and was sent home from hospital. But on October 5, his condition worsened and he was rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital’s A&E department. He died before doctors could conduct an ultrasound on his throat, which would have revealed the retropharyngeal abscess, which ruptured a blood vessel.

The inquest revealed that GPs, paediatricians and ear, nose and throat specialists failed to recognise the infection because it was easily mistaken for many other illnesses, including viral tonsillitis.

After a few days of quiet crying from Oliver, he was eventually admitted to hospital and treated for viral tonsillitis, only for doctors to realise it was a bacterial infection and put him on intravenous antibiotics

In a statement read to the court, specialist Dr Andrew Camilleri said the catastrophic bleed Oliver suffered as a result of the abscess is incredibly rare. He pointed to one case in South Africa but said there had been none in this country.

Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, coroner Mrs Lewis called for ‘mandatory paediatric training for GPs’. Her report and recommendations will be sent to the Department for Health, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the Royal College of General Practitioners.

Following treatment at the hospital reducing Oliver's symptoms, he was sent home to recover a few days later

Following his second admission to hospital after his condition worsened, doctors were making plans to give him an ultrasound to detect the problems in his throat, when he died of a bleed due to the abscess

An inquest labelled Oliver's death a passing by natural causes, but the coroner pledged to contact the government to try and improve guidelines around strep infections. In addition, his parents have been raising money for the children's ward at Whythenshawe hospital
