Students at a high school in Portland, Oregon, have elected a same-sex couple to its homecoming court.

The biggest controversy seems to be that, according to students at the school, there is actually no controversy.

Laurel Osborne and her girlfriend Sophia Schoenfeld were chosen by classmates at Cleveland High School in South-East Portland to be homecoming princess and, in a nod to equality, princess.

'At first, I didn't think it was that big of a deal,' Schoenfeld told KPTV. 'I thought, "That's cool." But there was an article written about it and it was really cool when I noticed how much of an impact it had. A lot of teachers came up to us and said, "Congratulations, it's a really big step."'

Each class at Cleveland High nominates six people for the homecoming court with Schoenfeld and Osborne selected as part of the senior class.

Underlining the theme of inclusion, the school has no vote for homecoming king and queen. Instead, court members run a relay race to see which couple wins the titles of homecoming king and queen.

While Schoenfeld and Osborne did not win the relay race they did get to ride on the royalty float during the school's homecoming football game.

'Everyone in our class congratulated us and was super excited about it,' Osborne said of the vote. 'We were so happy to be nominated.'

Cleveland High School's student newspaper The Clarion reported the most important factor in Osborne and Schoenfled's election was that 'no one made a big deal out of it... the senior class simply recognized two of their friends who were dating by voting for them as part of the homecoming court.'

The school paper quoted Principal Paul Cook saying, 'It speaks volumes' while school activities director Camille Adana said the election of a gay couple to homecoming showed 'Cleveland is educated with the times.'

Cleveland is not the only Portland high school in the news when it comes to sexual and gender identity.

Grant High School has become the first Portland public school - and one of the first high schools in the country - to install unisex bathrooms for its transgender students.

Willamette Week reports the city's biggest high school has designated six single-stall bathrooms - four for students and two for teachers - for transgender use.

According to the report, Grant administrators made the decision because the school's 10 transgender students were uncomfortable using the men's or women's restrooms.

'It’s a huge safety issue for people,' said Becca Dorn-Medieros, the school psychologist.
