Rosa Monckton, one of Princess Diana's confidantes, defended the young prince today

One of Princess Diana's closest friends has defended Prince Harry's naked Las Vegas antics by insisting he has done nothing 'wrong or immoral'.

As nude photographs of the prince made headlines around the world, Rosa Monckton said that Harry's mother had always believed in the distinction between her public and private life.

Ms Monckton told the Evening Standard: 'The same distinction should apply to her sons, both of whom are serving their country.

'He is first and foremost a soldier. He has served one tour in Afghanistan and will be returning.

'Young men in that situation always have it in the back of their minds that they may not come home. The second tour of duty is much harder than the first. So they party.

'He isn’t married. He has the absolute right to privacy in his private time. He hasn’t done anything wrong or immoral.'

Ms Monckton posted a message of support for 'top ging' Harry on her Twitter page, including a picture bearing the message: 'Sometimes you just have to pick yourself up and carry on.

The pictures of the naked royal with an unidentified naked woman in a Las Vegas hotel suite, first revealed to the world on U.S. celebrity gossip site TMZ, have not been published in the British press.

To see the pictures, the public has had to access TMZ, or scores of other internet pages across the globe carrying the images.

Although the incident is embarrassing
for Harry, who is due to embark on the next phase of his military 
career, he will not face repercussions from army bosses.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed to the Evening Standard that military officials will not take action against the young royal.

An official said: 'Since this all happened in private and was not against the law, it is not a breach of military discipline.'

Today a leading lawyer said that editors are respecting past rulings on privacy and their own press watchdog by not publishing the candid pictures.

British newspapers complied with a request from St James's Palace, made via the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), to respect Harry's privacy and not use the images as they were taken in a private hotel room.

Media commentators said the newspapers have been 'neutered' by Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry into media ethics.

But media lawyer Mark Stephens said editors realised they had to comply with the wishes of St James's Palace: "It's because they were asked not to by the PCC and they accepted it was probably the better way to go.

'We have seen many examples, going right back to Mrs Simpson when she was being courted by the former king (Edward VIII), when the British press declined to publish a story that was widely available.

'What we have is a story running on social media which the reasonable media here haven't taken up.'

He added that a number of high profile court cases involving celebrities had changed the way the press handle privacy.

'The courts have said for a long time that photographs are more intrusive (than words), like the Jamie Theakston case," said Mr Stephens.

In 2002 a judge allowed a Sunday newspaper to publish the details, but not the photographs, of Theakston visiting a prostitute in a Mayfair vice club.

Mr Stephens said: 'We don't need to see the pictures, they are gratuitous. It's for that reason they stay away from it.'

Former News of the World executive editor Neil Wallis said he would have published the photos before the inquiry into media ethics began, and the Leveson hearings had "neutered" the press.

He told BBC's Newsnight: 'The situation is fun, it's a good, classic newspaper situation. The problem is, in this post-Leveson era where newspapers are simply terrified of their own shadow, they daren't do things that most of the country, if they saw it in the newspaper, would think "that's a bit of a laugh".'

One non-mainstream British website to publish the pictures was the Guido Fawkes political blog.

And the Sun also broke ranks, splashing on the story by creating a mock-up of one of the images with naked staff posing as Harry and the woman.

The prince is back in the UK and is not expected to attend the opening of the Paralympics next week but is likely to attend some of the events to support the country's disabled athletes if his military duties allow.

A PCC spokesman confirmed that St James's Palace had contacted the organisation so the regulatory body could raise the Palace's concerns with editors.

He said it was a procedure open to all members of the public: 'There wasn't a formal complaint, this is a system available to people at the heart of a news story who feel the Editors' Code of Practice is likely to be breached.

'They thought Prince Harry had a reasonable right to privacy, being in a private hotel.'

TMZ said the photos were taken last Friday after the prince and his entourage met some women in a hotel bar and invited them up to the royal's suite.

The group played a stripping game and someone in the party is thought to have captured the image of the naked prince on a camera phone.

In the first photograph, the royal is shown wearing just a necklace and a wristband with his hands around his genitals as a seemingly topless woman stands close behind him.

The nude prince is shown in another picture shielding himself behind an unknown woman who is also naked, with his bare bottom facing the camera.

But there is no suggestion that anything other than horseplay is going on between the royal and the unnamed woman.

A source said the prince was just 'letting off steam' before the next important phase of his military career.

The pictures are the latest gaffe by the prince, whose past indiscretions include smoking cannabis as a teenager, being photographed in a Nazi uniform at a fancy dress party, and scuffling outside a nightclub with a photographer.

A number of the prince's charities have refused to comment about the pictures.
