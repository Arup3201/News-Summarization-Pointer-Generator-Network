Jonathan Trott's return to the cricketing fold received a welcome endorsement yesterday, when he was named captain of the Lions team that will tour South Africa in the new year.

Trott has not played for England since his shock return from Australia in the wake of the first Test in Brisbane last year suffering from what was eventually diagnosed as situation anxiety. 

But his rehabilitation, which faltered when he withdrew from county cricket soon after his return last season, has now reached the point where he is one step away from a full England recall.

 Jonathan Trott is expected to be named in an England Lions squad to tour South Africa in January

Trott has been named Lions captain following a series of impressive displayed for Warwickshire

First-class squad to face South Africa A

Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire), Gary Ballance (Yorkshire), Sam Billings (Kent), Jack Brooks (Yorkshire), Alex Lees (Yorkshire), Adam Lyth (Yorkshire), Craig Overton (Somerset), Liam Plunkett (Yorkshire), Boyd Rankin (Warwickshire), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Adam Riley (Kent), Sam Robson (Middlesex), Jonathan Trott (Warwickshire), James Vince (Hampshire). 

Jason Roy (Surrey), Stephen Parry (Lancashire) and Samit Patel (Notts) will replace Trott, Robson and Riley in the 50-over squad to face South Africa A  

Yet James Whitaker, England’s national selector, urged caution while welcoming the development. 

‘It’s exceptional news,’ said Whitaker at Lord’s yesterday. 

‘I have spoken to Trotty regularly and the improvement in his state of mind and readiness to get back involved in cricket has been huge for him.

‘He can take great credit for that.

‘Let’s work with him to get the best opportunities for him. 

'If it means he’s simply a county cricketer in the future then that’s still fantastic but we’ve given him a step-staged return and he will be going into an environment which is slightly higher than county cricket.
