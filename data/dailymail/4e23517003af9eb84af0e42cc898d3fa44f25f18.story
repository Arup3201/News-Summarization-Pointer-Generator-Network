A ship at the centre of a Royal Navy sex scandal has returned home without its commander, who was removed following allegations she had an affair with one of her crew members.

The HMS Portland sailed into Devonport Naval Base in Plymouth, Devon, yesterday after it was rumoured that Commander Sarah West, 41, had a relationship with married Lieutenant Commander Richard Gray, 35.

Around 600 family members waved at the crew who gathered on the deck as the ship rounded Devil's Point before docking out of sight.

Sex scandal: The HMS Portland returned to dock yesterday at the Devonport Naval Base in Plymouth, Devon, following rumours the ship's commander had a relationship with a crew member on board

Greeting: Crew members wave to the camera as they return home following a seven-month deployment

Alleged affair: Commander Sarah West, 41 (left), and Lieutenant Commander Richard Gray, 35 (right), are said to have started a relationship during the ship's seven month deployment

Welcome home: The vessel's crew members lined the ship's dock as they were greeted by family members on their return

Reception: Families hold up banners to welcome their loved ones home as they sail into dock 

The alleged affair is being investigated, and if claims are proven Commander West could face a formal warning, reassignment or even termination of her two decades of Navy service.

Lieutenant Commander Gray - who married wife Melissa, 33, just five weeks before he set sail - may also face disciplinary action.

HMS Portland set sail in January on a seven-month deployment undertaking maritime security operations, including counter narcotics and anti-piracy patrols.

The journey has taken them through Lisbon, Cape Verde, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Sao Tome and Principe, Angola, Namibia, South Africa, the Falkland Islands, Colombia and the Caribbean.

Commander West became the first woman to take charge of a frontline warship in the Navy's 500-year history in 2012.

When she was promoted, Cdr West revealed that her job had damaged her marriage to Navy helicopter pilot Andrew Whitlum - which broke down in 2006 - saying: 'My husband used to be in the Navy and all that time apart is a challenge.

'People who prosper in the armed forces tend to put their job as the priority, which isn't the best thing for a happy married life.'

When the alleged affair came to light, a Royal Navy spokesman said: 'We are aware of an allegation of a breach of the Code of Social Conduct on board HMS Portland, which we are treating seriously.

'Anyone found to fall short of the Royal Navy's high standards can expect to face appropriate action. It would be inappropriate to comment further.'

Voyage: The ship returned following a seven-month deployment which has taken them through Lisbon, Cape Verde, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Sao Tome and Principe, Angola, Namibia, South Africa, the Falkland Islands, Colombia and the Caribbean

Embrace: Kate O'Sullivan hugs her father alongside the HMS Portland after seven months at sea

Escort: A lifeguard boat guides the ship into the harbour under grey clouds in Pymouth, Devon

Sanctions: Commander West, who was removed from the boat after the allegations of the relationship surfaced, is the first woman to have taken charge of a frontline warship in the Royal Navy's history 

Reunited: Happy family members take pictures of their loved ones in the dock. The ships new commander Rob Brann said it was an 'honour' to bring the vessel home
