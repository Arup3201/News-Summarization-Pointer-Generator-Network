Renovations to the Prime Minister's Lodge in Canberra will now cost tax payers $6.4 million - making it more expensive than building an entirely new residence. 

Contract documents posted on the Australian government's AusTender website shows the cost of renovating the 40-room historic building now occupied by Prime Minister Tony Abbott has more than doubled from the original estimate price of $3.1 million. 

The upgrades, which started in September 2013 and were commissioned by the former Labor government, have been delayed and could now stretch on until December next year.

Renovations to the Prime Minister's Lodge in Canberra will now cost tax payers $6.4 million - making it more expensive than building an entirely new residence

Part of the delays rest with trying to find bathroom and toilet fittings that are aligned with strict heritage requirements, the Herald Sun reports. 

Renovations to the building built in 1920 include replacing the slate roof, asbestos removal, complete rewiring, insulating the ceiling, replacing old gutters and plumbing and fixing leaky bathrooms. 

The original contract and costs for the Lodge renovations have been amended more than 15 times since April this year. 

Construction of the Prime Minister's residence between 1926 to 1927 took 14 months and cost £28,319.

The government won't go into cost estimates for the renovations saying it was 'commercial in confidence'.

The Lodge has been closed since September 2013, which means Tony Abbott wasn't able to move in when he became Prime Minister

The Lodge has been empty since former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd moved out following his election loss in September 2013.

Tony Abbott never moved into the residence with his family and has spent the past 14 months in a $110 a night room at the Australia Federal Police College in Barton, just two kilometres away from the Lodge.

While public servants had rented Mr Abbott a $3,000 a week home as renovations took place, he declined and it cost $65,000 in lease termination fees. 

The Lodge, which is located in Deakin at 5 Adelaide Avenue, is just a stone's throw away from Parliament House. It is one of Canberra's more prestigious suburbs. 

The contractor undertaking the renovations is Canberra-based building company Manteena, which has carried out several projects for the past four governments.
