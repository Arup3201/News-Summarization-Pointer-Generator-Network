On trial: Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks arrives at the Old Bailey yesterday

The phone hacking case has put ‘British justice on trial’, a judge declared yesterday.

In an extraordinary address to the jury hearing the case of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and ex-Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson, trial judge Mr Justice Saunders stressed that the stakes could not be higher for Britain’s judicial system.

‘In a way it is not only the defendants on trial, it is British justice on trial,’ he said.

He made the unprecedented comments as a jury of nine women and three men were sworn in to try Brooks and Coulson, both 45 and both former News of the World editors.

They are accused with others of being part of a six-year conspiracy to hack the phones of public figures at the now-defunct Sunday tabloid.

Ahead of the case opening later today, the judge issued a lengthy series of instructions to the Old Bailey jury, telling them: ‘I’m going to give you some extremely important directions.

‘They are always important, but they could not be more important than they are in this particular case.

‘It is a central principle of our system of trial by jury that you decide your verdicts on the evidence and arguments you hear in court, and only the evidence and arguments that you hear in court.’

The judge said there had been an unprecedented amount of publicity about the case, some of which was ‘offensive and demeaning’ to some of the defendants.

He told them to disregard an inflammatory cover of the current edition of Private Eye featuring Brooks, telling them to ignore what he called a joke ‘in especially bad taste’.

 Jurors were also told to ignore comment on the case on Twitter and other social media sites.

In a dig at celebrity tweeters, he said: ‘Some public figures – well-known actors, musicians, politicians and others – publish blogs and send tweets in which they not only express their views on their own areas of expertise, but also on topics about which they know very little.

‘I very much hope they will not do so 
during the trial. They may well be breaking the law if they do so and 
appropriate action will be taken if they do.

‘The
 internet is often fuelled by speculation. There has been a great deal 
of publicity about the subject matter of this case, perhaps an 
unprecedented amount.

‘A significant amount of publicity and speculation has been inaccurate and misleading.

‘Some, particularly on the internet on

lot of it is ill-informed and most of it is abusive.’

Comments: Mr Justice Saunders said the stakes could not be higher for Britain's judicial system

Jurors were warned they could face jail for contempt of court if they ignored the judge’s directions.

Brooks and Coulson allegedly conspired with former News of the World head of news Ian Edmondson, 44, the tabloid’s ex-managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, and others to illegally access voicemails between October 2000 and August 2006.

Brooks is also charged with conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office linked to alleged inappropriate payments to public officials.

She also faces allegations of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice – one with former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 49 – over the alleged removal of material from News International.

Brooks, her husband Charlie Brooks and former head of security at News International Mark Hanna are also accused of conspiring together to pervert the course of justice.

Coulson, David Cameron’s former spin doctor, is also charged with conspiring with the News of the World’s former royal editor, Clive Goodman, 56, to commit misconduct in public office.

They all deny the charges.

Shortly after lunch yesterday afternoon, nine women and three men learned that they would be spending most of their days between now and next summer cooped up in Court 12 of the Old Bailey.

No mean undertaking. By teatime, it had become a much, much bigger deal than that following Mr Justice Saunders’ grave proclamation that ‘British justice is on trial’ here.

You might expect to read that sort of thing in a newspaper headline but not to hear it from the mouth of a distinguished judge.

'Trial of the century': Mr Justice Saunders, with defendants (left to right in the dock) Ian Edmondson, Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson, Stuart Kuttner, Clive Goodman, Cheryl Carter, Charlie Brooks and Mark Hanna

Little wonder this has already had the ‘trial of the century’ tag slapped all over it. It’s going to be a dawn start in the queue for the public gallery.

This afternoon, the prosecution will start to outline the case against eight defendants including former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and former Number Ten communications maestro Andy Coulson.

Yesterday, they were all on their feet to
 hear the charges. The glass-fronted dock looked more like an executive 
box at a rather lugubrious race meeting than a traditional Old Bailey 
line-up.

Miss Brooks appeared paler than of late, her famous Titian locks now perhaps a few shades darker than when this all started.

Because the defendants must sit according to their position on the court list, she was not next to her husband, Charlie Brooks, who was towards the other end of the dock. 

Chin-up confident and taking notes on a computer, he managed the occasional smile during some of the opening legal acrobatics.

There were so many wigs in the room that I totted up 18 at one point, 20 at another. It was like trying to count sheep.

So vast is this assembly of legal expertise that the normal press benches have been allocated to all the solicitors while the press have been given a few chairs behind the ushers.

Most of the media were left to follow proceedings by video link three floors below.

Just visible between Mr Brooks and former royal correspondent Clive Goodman was Miss Brooks’s petite former personal assistant, Cheryl Carter.

When the defendants were invited to sit, she almost faded from view altogether.

Alongside Mr Goodman, the retired managing editor of the News of the World, Stuart Kuttner, was clinging with both hands to the bars between the glass panels as he stood to hear the charges.

Later on, the jury was informed that the  73-year-old would only be present when  specifically required due to ill health.

On his right, impassive and smartly-dressed in grey suit, white shirt and pale blue tie, Mr Coulson followed everything intensely.

Once or twice, he intervened to ask some of the less audible barristers to speak up during their legal arguments.

Such are the complexities of this case that it may be Christmas before we hear from the defendants.

But Judge Saunders was taking no chances that these jurors might be swayed – and not just by the inane tweets of clueless celebs.

He also warned people sitting in the public gallery – where Murdoch-bashing Labour MP Tom Watson was much in evidence during the day – that they should not display any sort of reaction in front of the jury.

Though no details were heard in open court yesterday, the judge even told the jurors to avoid mentioning the case to anyone ‘over a pint’ in the pub on the way home last night.

On a more upbeat note, he did at least joke that by the end of this very considerable ‘bonding’ exercise, many of them would be ‘friends for life’.

Even veterans of the Bailey were struggling to recall the last time a jury received a set of directions quite like this.

As dusk fell on the departing defendants and the camera crews dispersed for another night, a pair of splendid plane trees peered down on the scene from the churchyard of St Sepulchre’s Church.

Untroubled by this week’s storms, they are still sporting a full thatch of green leaves.

It is a sobering thought that the whole lot will have turned brown, fallen off, moulded away, sprouted anew and grown back all over again by the time this epic reaches its conclusion.
