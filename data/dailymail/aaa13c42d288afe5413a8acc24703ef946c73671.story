Two-year-old twin girls who were joined at the chest and abdomen have been separated after nine hours of surgery at a California hospital.

Doctors at Stanford University's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital said Angelica and Angelina Sabuco should now make full recoveries.

Paediatric surgeon Dr Gary Hartman, along with a team of more than 20 physicians and nurses from various specialties, said the surgery went smoothly and he expected both girls to do well.

Brave: Conjoined twins Angelica and Angelina Sabuco will undergo a nine-hour procedure tomorrow with hopes they will grow up to lead normal lives

Operation: Dr Gary Hartman operates on Angelica and Angelina during the nine-hour surgery on the conjoined twins

Scale: More than 20 surgeons and nurses were involved in the operation at the Lucille Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California

He said: 'The long-term prognosis is that we should have a happy, healthy set of girls. We don't see any barrier to a full recovery.

The twins' mother, Ginady Sabuco, called the operation 'a dream come true'. She added: 'Words cannot express how the family feels.'

The operation took months of planning and required the separation of livers, diaphragms, breastbones and chest and abdominal wall muscles.

It began at around 6.30am yesterday morning and by mid-afternoon the girls had their own operating rooms for the second phase of surgery - reconstructing the area where they had been connected.

They were then moved to an intensive care unit, each with a scar stretching from her chest to her belly.

Both girls are being kept sedated and doctors said they could be awakened earlier today, CBS reported. They are likely to remain in hospital for at least two weeks.

The reconstruction included covering 
what plastic surgeon Dr. Peter Lorenz described as a 'window' left in 
their chests after separation.

Since July, the girls had received 
weekly injections of sterile saltwater into balloons placed under their 
skin. The procedure stretched their skin and grew new skin to patch the 
area.

Angelina and Angelica, who were born 
in the Philippines and live in San Jose with their parents and 
ten-year-old brother, have done well so far.

They love listening to stories and music, and they know their colours and can count to ten.

And like many children their age, they love Dora the Explorer and Elmo, and celebrated their second birthdays with cakes adorned with Disney princesses and Tinker Bell.

But remaining conjoined carries risks for the girls' physical health, especially if they share organs unequally. If one conjoined twin dies, the other will die within hours.

Conjoined: Angelica and Angelina are classified as thoraco-omphalopagus - their livers, diaphragms, breast bones, chest and abdominal wall muscles are fused

Risky: The nine-hour operation will involve cutting along the girls' skin and muscle and separating their diaphragms and livers

Angelica and Angelina were classified 
as thoraco-omphalopagus - joined at the chest and abdomen. Their livers,
diaphragms, breast bones, chest and abdominal wall muscles are fused. 
They have separate hearts, brains, kidneys, stomachs and intestines.

The occurrence of conjoined twins is estimated to range from one in 50,000 births to one in 100,000 births worldwide.

According
to the hospital, only about six separation surgeries are done annually 
in the U.S. Most conjoined twins never survive pregnancy and the overall
survival rate is approximately 25 per cent.

According
to ABC News, there have been approximately two dozen sets of conjoined 
twins in the world who have been successfully separated.

The operation involved cutting along the girls' skin and muscle and separating their diaphragms and livers. Doctors snipped any adhesions between the girls' bowels. Separate reconstruction operations will follow.

While the hospital would not discuss the cost of the surgery, officials told the network part of the expenses will be paid for by the family's medical insurance.

They will be the second set of conjoined twins separated at the hospital. The last such procedure took place in November 2007.
