Ligue 1 side Montpellier face a huge bill after its Stade de la Mosson stadium was flooded due to heavy weather in the area.

Last week the city was pictured underwater as devastating flash floods created a 'natural disaster' across the south of France.

The effects of this have resulted in Montpellier having to cancel their 40-year anniversary party as their ground is submerged with water that has damaged the pitch, gym, changing rooms and offices.

French club Montpellier's Stade de la Mosson is badly in need of repairs after the city was hit by mass flooding last week

The effects of the 'natural disaster' has seen the Ligue 1's football ground resemble a mud bath with the football pitch destroyed

Workers are now in force to try and repair the ground, with the club's next home game against Lyon on October 19

Images from the club's official Twitter account show the full extent of the destruction with the football pitch in particular resembling a mud bath after water rose up to the fifth rank of the stands - about three metres high.

At the start of the downpour  up to 12 inches of rain had fallen – almost 50 per cent of Montpellier's average rainfall for the entire year.

Montpellier's next game is at home against Lyon on October 19 but that fixture could be in doubt due to the state of their pitch with the club potentially having to look for a new venue while their stadium is being repaired.

'We could play our games elsewhere for a moment,' club president Laurent Nicollin admitted.

La Paillade drew 1-1 away to Nice on Saturday and are currently seventh in Ligue 1 with 14 points after nine matches.

That fixture could be in doubt though with repair-work also required elsewhere within the Stade de la Mosson

The extreme weather has seen the club's seats filled with water, mud and even branches at the Stade de la Mosson

The extent of the damage has meant the club's changing room facilities are also currently submerged with water

The French club will also need to repair their walls which have been damaged as a result of the flooding
