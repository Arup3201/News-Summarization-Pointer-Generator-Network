If you've ever wanted to change your nail varnish but don't have the time, help could be at hand.

A new concept puts tiny screens with a wireless connection on each nail - allowing patterns to be instantly changed from an app.

The 'bloom your nails'; concept today won a prestigious Intel contest for wearable computers, raising hopes it would one day become a reality.

the concept designs shown off by Lee: Each nail is a small screen that can be wirelessly updated form a phone app

Each nail is a small screen, complete with power source and wireless communication system.

The screen has a days power, and must be recharged overnight.

Designed are selected via an app, and then synced to the nail.

Users can choose from designer nails, or create their own - and even then sell them to other users of the system.

'Bloom your nails is a set of wearable devices that are nails,' said Gin Lee, the Taiwanese student who developed the concept.

Users can replace the patterns and design via a mobile application.

'Users can upload their own designers, and even sell them to other users,' Lee said.

'Through the syncing between the app and nail, you can enrich your fingernail patters and make sure you stand out.'

The nails include wireless chips allowing them to communicate.

At night, the nails are simply removed and recharge for another full day's wear.

An app is used to choose a pattern, which is then sent to the nail, changing it instantly.

The battery powered nails have enough power for an entire day's wear, Lee said.

At night, they are simoply removed and placed on a special recharging stand.

The concept was part of chipmaker Intel's Make it Wearable project, a global year-long initiative sponsored by Intel to support the evolution of wearables.

Students (ages 13 and up, except where prohibited), designers, engineers, and makers can get involved in the contest.
