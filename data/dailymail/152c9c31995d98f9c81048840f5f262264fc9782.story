A New York teenager who took a ‘test drive’ in a family friends’ Lamborghini has died after crashing the high-powered sports car into a guardrail.

Samuel Shepard, 18, of Mount Sinai, Long Island was taking the car for a spin on a local county road early on Friday when he lost control.

He was driving north in Mount Sinai at 2:25 a.m. in the 2010 Lamborghini which can cost anywhere between $200,000 and $300,000 second hand and slammed into a guardrail near Route 25A, police said.

Shortly after the crash, the teenager was pronounced dead at Stony Brook University Hospital.

The car's owner, Michael Power, 49, was a passenger in the car and was treated for non life-threatening injuries.

Power, a friend of the Shepard family, had met the teenager at a parking lot near his home.

They started talking about taking a test drive in the Lamborghini, Detective Sergeant Michael Fitzharris of the Sixth Precinct said.

Detective Fitzharris told Newsday that excessive speed is believed to be a factor in the crash.

He said: ‘I think it was probably just a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the kid, and this man chose to give him this opportunity.’

The crash occurred as the teenager returned to the parking lot.

But no witnesses have come forward yet according to police.

The teenager, who had graduated from Mount Sinai High School in June was looking forward to joining the elite Army Rangers and was supposed to start serving in October, his family said.

His father, Gene Shepard owns Good Shepard Autobody in Port Jefferson Station.

He said that Lamborghinis were his son's favorite car. The teenager's Facebook page also has dozens of photos of fast cars and bikes on it along with flyers for car rallies.

Mr Shepard said: ‘He was a very talented kid with his 
hands. He always helped me at the shop. ... He used to see his dad was 
working hard and he'd pick up tools and start helping.’

‘Since he's a kid, he's been around cars,’ he said.

‘He had his whole future planned out. He knew exactly what he was going to be doing, he told Newsday.

However, his stunned father said that he had no idea about the test drive with Power, who had known Samuel since he was 4.

Anyone who may have witnessed the crash is asked to contact the Sixth Squad at 631-854-8652 or call anonymously to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-220-TIPS.
