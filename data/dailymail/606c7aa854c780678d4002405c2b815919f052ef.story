Barcelona stalwart Xavi has hit out at the Court Of Arbitration for Sport's (CAS) decision to uphold a FIFA sanction that means the club will not be allowed to sign any players in 2015.

The Spanish giants were handed the ban after they were deemed to have breached rules on signing international players under the age of 18, but Xavi believes the decision is unfair.

'We have all been screwed by the CAS decision. I expected them to be more lenient,' Xavi told Sport.

Xavi still thinks Barca are strong, with a front line of 'three beasts' - Luis Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi

Suarez was one of five players to move to the Nou Camp in the summer, but they now cannot sign any more

'I find it a huge injustice because no club in the world takes better care of their young players. This will make us even stronger.

Despite the ban, Xavi believes Barca will still have enough to be a threat in every match, due to the 'three beasts' dominating their front line.

'The top three are three beasts,' the 34-year-old continued. 'The attack has potential for very good games. Neymar is performing brutally, you will see Luis Suarez increasingly improve and Messi has returned to give his best.' 

On top of the ban, Barca will also be made to pay a fine of 450,000 Swiss Francs (£293,000).
