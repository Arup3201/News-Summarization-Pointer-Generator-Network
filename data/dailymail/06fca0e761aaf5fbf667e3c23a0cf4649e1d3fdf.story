A father and daughter who belonged to a Chinese cult have been executed for beating a woman to death with an iron bar at a McDonald's restaurant as customers watched. 

Zhang Fan, 29, and Zhang Lidong, 54, were among five members of the banned Quannengshen cult convicted of attacking the woman after she reportedly rebuffed their attempts to recruit her.

The pair 'were put to death by the Intermediate People's Court of Yantai city', China's official news agency Xinhua said.

China uses both lethal injection and shooting for executions, but the method was not specified. 

State media gave the executions prominent coverage on Monday, broadcasting CCTV showing the Zhangs in court, as well as replaying a film of the attack. 

Shortly after the brutal attack in May last year, a three-minute video circulated online showing the incident at a McDonald's in Zhaoyuan, in China's Shandong province.

At the time, the clip caused uproar as it showed customers watch while the woman screamed in agony as she was beaten to death. No-one was reported to have tried to help her. 

The graphic video showed a man resembling Zhang Lidong strike out angrily with a pole and shout: 'Damn you, devil! Go to hell!'

A woman is also heard in the clip screaming: 'Kill her! Beat her to death!'

The footage, apparently shot on a mobile phone, only included a fraction of a second showing the person thought to be the victim, only known as Miss Wu.

Reports said the victim was having dinner at the fast food restaurant when a man, identified as Mr Zhang, asked for her phone number.

When she refused, the violence unfolded over a brief 20-minute period - and Zhang used an iron bar to beat Miss Wu to death right in the middle of the restaurant. 

Chinese media reported Zhang's friends joined in and also beat Miss Wu, kicking her in the head as she lay on the ground in a pool of her own blood.

They then proceeded to use an iron-handled mop to strike her in the head and continued to do so until the handle broke. 

Miss Wu, 37, who was a mother, died at the scene. 

Three others convicted over the attack -- including another daughter of Zhang Lidong's - were given prison sentences, ranging from seven years to life, for offences including 'undermining law enforcement using heresy'.

In the wake of the killing, state media said 1,000 Quannengshen members had been arrested including 'high-level organisers and backbone members'.  

At the time, Xinhua accused members of the group as being 'responsible for numerous suicides and murders, in which many victims were the perpetrators' family members'. 

Similar numbers were held at the end of 2012, when the organisation was under the spotlight for predicting an apocalypse and the state-run Global Times said it had called on members to overthrow the Communist Party. 

Quannengshen, whose name can be translated as Church of Almighty God, believe that Jesus has been reincarnated as a Chinese woman. They refer to the ruling Communist Party as the 'great red dragon'.

On its website, where one section is headed 'The Maturer the People Become, the Sooner the Great Red Dragon Will Collapse', the group describes the authorities as 'the persecutor of God and the enemy of God'.

The group was outlawed by the government in the mid-1990s and its founders moved to the United States in 2000, Xinhua said.  

In the months after Miss Wu's murder a number of entries on the group's website attempted to distance it from 'these several ruffians'.

The posts claimed that the murder was used by the party as a pretext to crack down on Quannengshen.

'It's not difficult to see that the 'May 28 incident' is completely a false case created by the (party) to frame and condemn the Church of Almighty God,' one post said.

'Prisoners admit a confession by torture. Whatever the (party) asks them to say, they have to say it.'

China has previously cracked down harshly on groups it labels 'cults', most notably the Falungong spiritual movement, which was banned in the late 1990s.

It has since detained tens of thousands of its members, according to rights groups, with some saying they have been tortured for refusing to give up their beliefs.

Falungong insists it is targeted because the Communist Party views it as a threat.
