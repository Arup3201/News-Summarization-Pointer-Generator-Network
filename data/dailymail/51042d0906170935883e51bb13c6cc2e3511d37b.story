An amateur artist has created a series of hilarious images combining iconic film scenes with everyday locations around France.

History teacher Francois Dourlen, from Cherbourg in France, has used stills from cult movies including Diehard, Edward Scissorhands, and Super Mario Brothers to produce his unique artwork.

By using his smartphone to download pictures of Bruce Willis and Johnny Depp, he then positions the images in front of ordinary backdrops to comical effect.
