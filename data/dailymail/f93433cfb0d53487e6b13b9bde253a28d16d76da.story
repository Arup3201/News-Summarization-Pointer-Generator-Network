They say that a dog is man's best friend. But for certain elderly people in the North East of England, fur has been swapped for feathers.

The lives of dozens of pensioners have been transformed thanks to a charity scheme that uses hens to counter loneliness.

From bedrooms to beauty salons, there has been an invasion of two-legged friends - with care home residents competing against each other design the best coop and bag the best bird at auction.

Their owners, who have been dubbed ‘hensioners’, are hoping that raising the chickens will improve their health and well-being.

Hot chicks: A charity has hopes to combat loneliness among elderly people by giving them hens to look after. The HenPower project has seen dozens of elderly enthusiasts get involved in the day-to-day care of the poultry, feeding and cleaning them, and even treating them for lice.

The HenPower project has seen dozens of elderly enthusiasts get involved in the day-to-day care of the poultry, feeding and cleaning them, and even treating them for lice.

So far, dozens of the creatures have been reared by hen lovers at eight care homes in the Gateshead area of Tyne and Wear.

One chicken convert is 78-year-old George Stewart who has lived at the Wood Green sheltered housing scheme in Gateshead for three years.

He said: ‘When I came here, I felt pretty isolated but then I used to watch the hens and it wasn’t half relaxing. It’s changed my life, to be honest.'

Such is the enthusiasm surrounding the scheme, that the ‘hensioners’ have designed their own bespoke coops, have chosen rare breeds to buy and have bid for birds at auction.

‘Hensioner’ Alan Richards, 76, said: ‘We went to the auction really just to bid for some fertile eggs.

‘But we came back with 36 eggs and 10 hens. I’ve been going to places I’ve never been to before.

‘It helps me get out of the house, and instead of sitting in front of the TV drinking and smoking, I’ve been talking at conferences about HenPower in front of 200 people.’

Birds of a feather: 'I've experienced times with the residents that you couldn't put into words,' says hen enthusiast Lynne Walker. People go home at the end of the day filled with stories and memories'

Lynne Walker, a sheltered scheme officer, involved in the scheme, added: ‘I’ve experienced times with the residents that you couldn’t put into words. People go home at the end of the day filled with stories and memories. 

‘Sometimes I go home and I can still be laughing at the antics of the day. I can stand back and just watch and it can make me really emotional to think how much progress they’ve made and how far we have all come.’

The HenPower pensioners are now on a mission to share the chicken love - visiting local schools and nurseries with their hens.

Ossie Creswell, 87, said: ‘I get great pleasure from visiting the other care homes and going to the schools and telling them all about the hens.

‘The kiddies’ faces always light up – they’re a bit shy to begin with but then you can’t get the hens off them!’

Douglas Hunter, Director of Equal Arts, the charity behind the scheme, added: ‘It’s really important for older people to keep busy and if they can, to share the skills and experience they have with different generations.

‘That’s what HenPower is all about, breaking down the stereotypes and celebrating the fact that older people enjoy a positive later life and contribute significantly to their local communities.’

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently said it was a ‘national shame’ that as many as 800,000 people in England are chronically lonely.

He said that 46 per cent of people aged 80 or over reported feeling lonely ‘some of the time or often’.

Mr Hunter added: ‘Mr Hunt is right to raise the issue of loneliness amongst older people.

It's not yoke: Douglas Hunter, director of Equal Arts, said: 'HenPower has removed the isolation that may have been a feature of their lives before and we have so many examples of older people telling us how they are enjoying their lives to the full'

‘But if ever he needs an example of older people who have transformed their lives, people who feel invigorated and excited about what they do, then he should visit one of our HenPower homes.

‘HenPower has removed the isolation that may have been a feature of their lives before and we have so many examples of older people telling us how they are enjoying their lives to the full.

‘They are not just interacting with the hens, but with each other, sharing their experiences and making new friendships.’

HenPower was set up last year thanks to a £168,000 grant from the Big Lottery Fund.

Equal Arts, a charity which delivers projects for older people, is now hoping to be given another grant from the Big Lottery Fund so it can roll the scheme out across the country.

Previous research has highlighted the health benefits of pet ownership.

The American Heart Association carried out research which showed that people who have heart problems are more likely to survive if they have the companionship of a pet.

It also found that people who own a dog are less likely to develop heart disease.

This is thought to be because they tend to walk further and because their pet relieves stress and reduces their chance of obesity.

Researchers at the Hospital Research Centre of Brest, in France, discovered that children with autism sometimes develop better social skills if they have a pet to play with.

They say autistic children are better able to offer comfort people and to share toys if they have a pet.

Other research has suggested that people who own a pet tend to be less lonely, less fearful and more extroverted.
