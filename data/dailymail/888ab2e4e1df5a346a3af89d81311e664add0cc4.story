The Prime Minister and his deputy Julie Bishop have appeared in public together for the first time since news of a leadership spill emerged, with Mr Abbott declaring the motion will fail.

He said he will take that as a an endorsement of his leadership, and also claimed the coalition was elected to end the 'Game of Thrones' circus of chaos and disunity during Labor's years in government. 

'The last thing anyone wants is to see a government in this country turn into some kind of Game of Thrones,' he said in Townsville.

'Despite some distractions, I am just getting on with government.'

On Saturday morning Prime Minister Tony Abbott and deputy Julie Bishop appeared as a united front in Queesland

Mr Abbott said the two backbenchers who foreshadowed the spill motion were entitled to take that action

He also revealed he believes the spill will fail and if so he will take that as an endorsement of his leadership 

Mr Abbott said the two Liberal backbenchers who foreshadowed the spill motion were entitled to take that action and it would be dealt with in the party room on Tuesday in a secret ballot.

'Should this spill motion be defeated, as I expect, I will be taking that as a strong endorsement of the existing leadership team, as a vote of confidence in the existing leadership team,' he said.

Mr Abbott said it wasn't about him.

'It's never been about me, it's always been as far as I am concerned about delivering good government,' he said.

Flanked by deputy leader Julie Bishop, who offered her unqualified support, and Nationals leader Warren Truss, Mr Abbott said the people of Australia expected them to get on with the job of government not engage in navel gazing.

Ms Bishop said as Mr Abbott's deputy, she supported the prime minister.

'I was elected the deputy of this party in 2007 and again in 2013. I understand from my colleagues that they look to me for stability and certainty,' she said.

This public appearance comes after much speculation that Ms Bishop did not support Mr Abbott and would not stand on a ticket with him

The pair were in North Queensland to announce the government will provide the necessary immigration, customs and quarantine facilities to allow Townsville airport to begin receiving and dispatching international flights from March 1 

This latest public appearance comes off the back of weeks of turmoil in the Liberal party.

On Friday, Liberal backbencher Luke Simpkins, a little-known West Australian MP, announced he had moved a motion to topple the Prime Minister in an email to his Liberal colleagues. 

In a fiery address, a clearly angered Mr Abbott said on the same day: 'We are not the Labor Party. We are not going to repeat the chaos and instability of the Labor years.   

'I have spoken to deputy leader Julie Bishop and we will stand together to urge the party room to defeat this particular motion.'

But Ms Bishop, who did not appear with Mr Abbott, would only issue a short and very qualified statement of support. 

'I agreed with the Prime Minister that due to cabinet solidarity and my position as Deputy Leader there should be support for current leadership in spill motion,' she said.

Ms Bishop's support could be pivotal to the Liberal leadership. Scott Morrison has ruled himself out of the top job but Malcolm Turnbull has not. 

Mr Abbott said the MPs who called for the spill - Mr Simpkins and fellow backbencher Don Randall - were perfectly entitled to call for a challenge. 

However, he said: 'They are asking the Party Room to vote out the people that the electorate voted in in September 2013.' 

He said that the knighthood of Prince Philip, issued by Mr Abbott on Australia Day, was the final straw for him. 

In his email to his Liberal colleagues he wrote: 'The knighthood issue was for many the final proof of a disconnection with the people,' Simpkins wrote in the email.

'I think that we must bring this to a head, and test the support of the leadership in the party room.

'I have therefore submitted to the Chief Government Whip a motion to spill the leadership positions of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal party.' 

Chief Government Whip Phillip Ruddock said the matter had been listed for discussion for the Tuesday party room meeting.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott will reportedly face a leadership challenge on Tuesday in Canberra

Meanwhile, Tasmanian Liberal MP Andrew Nikolic has branded the move to challenge Mr Tony Abbott as disappointing and divisive.

In an email to backbench colleague Mr Simpkins,  Mr Nikolic dismissed the move as the 'ill-disciplined and self-interested behaviours that the Australian people explicitly rejected in 2013'.

The email was copied to other coalition MPs and senators. The note reportedly reads: 'Luke, Your actions are disappointing and divisive.

'In my view you are repeating the ill-disciplined and self-interested behaviours that the Australian people explicitly rejected in 2013.

'You do not have my support for this.

'I will be arguing strongly against your motion and in support of what I believe is a clear majority of colleagues and constituents who prefer stability and unity of purpose.'

It's the first Liberal leadership challenge since 2009. After the internal fallout from the-then Liberal Party and Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull's support for the Rudd Government's ETS plan in 2009 (which split the Coalition because of the National Party's opposition to it) there was a three-way spill, involving Mr Turnbull, Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey.

In the end, Abbott claimed the leadership by one vote over Turnbull, 42 votes to 41. No one has put up their hand to contest Mr Abbott, but Mr Turnbull would not rule out a challenge on Thursday evening.
