Pubs will stay open late for England games during this summer’s World Cup, despite warnings about the dangers of booze-fuelled violence.

Home Secretary Theresa May said licensing hours would be extended for Roy Hodgson’s side taking on Italy from 11pm on June 14.

Pubs and clubs could also see their opening times changed if England reaches the knock-out stages, in the face of opposition from police and town halls.

Pubs will be able to stay open later for England Word Cup games in Rio, the Home Secretary Theresa May announced

Home Office minister Norman Baker rejected calls for pubs to stay open late to show the match against Italy.

But Prime Minister David Cameron intervened and overruled him.

The move is good news for England fans looking to celebrate the team’s victories or – as seems more likely - drown their sorrows in defeat during this summer’s tournament in Brazil.

England’s two other group matches against Uruguay and Costa Rica kick off at 8pm and 5pm respectively, so will not benefit from the rule change.

But if the team reach the knockout stages with 9pm kick offs the relaxation could come into play again in the event of extra time.

In a written ministerial statement, Mrs May said: ‘The Government has consulted on whether to relax licensing hours nationally for England matches with late kick off times during the FIFA World Cup in June and July 2014.

‘Following this, the Government has decided to relax licensing hours nationally to mark England’s participation in the tournament.

‘The relaxation of licensing hours will relate to the sale of alcohol for consumption on the premises and the provision of late night refreshment in licensed premises in England, at specified dates and times only.’

The Home Office previously rejected a request from the British Beer and Pub Association asking for an extension of licensing times to 1am for the Italy game.

Mr Baker turned down the proposal, leaving pubs with the option of applying individually to local authorities for a licence extension through the temporary event notice system - at a cost of £21 each.

But the Prime Minister ordered a rethink.

Ministers have the power to relax the rules to mark an occasion of ‘exceptional international, national or local significance’, as was done for the Royal Wedding and Diamond Jubilee.

In an effort to curb problem drinking, supermarkets and other shops will be barred from selling alcohol at below cost price from April 6 under new licensing restrictions brought in for the World Cup finals.

The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, has argued the issue of which pubs can open late should be ‘determined locally’.

Tony Page, LGA licensing spokesman, said: 'A World Cup summer is always an exciting time and councils understand that watching matches in a local pub is a key part of the whole experience. Councils also support moves that bring communities together and also help the local economy.

'However, licensing decisions should be taken locally. While councils will always look to grant extensions to well-run and responsible businesses, they need to be able to target their limited resources most effectively and protect residents living close to popular venues from unnecessary disruption.

'A blanket national relaxation means councils will not be able to plan ahead and minimise any disruption through sensible licensing restrictions but will instead have to react to issues as best they can.'

Official Home Office documents point out that using the power during the World Cup could lead to ‘alcohol-related crime and disorder, public nuisance and risks to public safety.’
