Daniel Sturridge will not play for Liverpool again until 2015 following the latest setback in his nightmare season.

The England striker is set for another six weeks on the sidelines after scan results confirmed he had suffered a grade two thigh strain during training at Melwood on Monday.

It is the same thigh Sturridge damaged whilst on England duty in September but it is a completely different injury. The rehabilitation programme, however, is the same and that means he will miss a huge chunk of Liverpool's stuttering campaign.

Daniel Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since August and now could be out until next year

If Daniel Sturridge is out for the next twelve matches, he will miss the following fixtures for Liverpool:

Crystal Palace (A) - November 23

Ludogorets (A) - November 26

Stoke (H) - November 29

Leicester (A) - December 2

Sunderland (H) - December 6

Basle (H) - December 9

Manchester United (A) - December 14

Bournemouth (A) - December 17

Arsenal (H) - December 21

Burnley (A) - December 26

Swansea (H) - December 29

Leicester (H) - January 1

'Sturridge has already missed Liverpool's last 14 games but he could potentially miss their next 12 fixtures, which include assignments against Ludogorets, in Sofia next Tuesday, and Basle (December 9) that will decide their fate in the Champions League.

Aside from that, Sturridge will also be absent for huge clashes in the Barclays Premier League against Manchester United at Old Trafford (December 14) and Arsenal at Anfield (December 21), as well as a tricky Capital One Cup quarter-final away at Bournemouth.

Liverpool said in a statement: 'LFC confirmed scans have revealed Daniel Sturridge has sustained a new thigh injury. The player will remain unavailable for selection but will be monitored and assessed during his recovery.' 

Given Sturridge's injury history, it is unlikely he will be back inside six weeks and he has still not kicked a ball for Liverpool since signing a new contract, which is has the potential to be worth £150,000 per week, on October 3. 

It is a massive blow for Brendan Rodgers, who had been hoping to relaunch Sturridge's campaign at Crystal Palace on Sunday, but his patience will now be being tested by how much the 25-year-old has been out.

After Liverpool drew 0-0 with Hull last month, Rodgers gave a glimpse of his feelings of being without Sturridge when he said: 'He won’t become a top European striker until he plays consistently. It doesn’t matter about potential. You have to play.' 

When Sturridge first damaged his thigh at St George's Park on September 5, his recovery was slower than expected and he ended up back at square one when he pulled a calf muscle in training.

Sturridge resumed full training once again at Melwood last week but he now has to start the rehabilitation process all over again and, for Rodgers, it could not have come at a worse time.

Fabio Borini, Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli have failed to score in 998 minutes of Premier League football for Liverpool and Rodgers would be entitled to feel worn out by the situation by his side's lack of goals.

In an attempt to find a solution, they would be prepared to offer Lille more money to secure Divock Origi's release from a season-long in January. They signed the Belgium striker for £10million in the summer but agreed to loan him back to Lille immediately.
