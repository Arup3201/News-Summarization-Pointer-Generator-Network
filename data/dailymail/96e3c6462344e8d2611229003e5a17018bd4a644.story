Three teenagers have been arrested in connection with a robbery that saw a Grand Theft Auto fan stabbed, hit with a brick and robbed after queuing to buy the new game.

The 23-year-old victim had stood in line for hours at a supermarket to buy the game and was on his way home when he was attacked in the Colindale area of north west London.

A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed this morning that three people, aged 15, 16 and 18 are being questioned by detectives at a north London police station.

Investigation: The attack happened in Princes Avenue, Colindale, at around 1.20am yesterday following the release of the game at midnight

He added: 'The motive for the attack is unclear at this stage.'

The unnamed man is recovering in hospital where he remains in a stable condition.

The three men were arrested close to the area where the attack took place.

Detectives had said in the hours following the attack that they believe he was 
specifically targeted after his attackers saw crowds of fans queuing in the car
 park of Asda superstore in Colindale, North-West London before the game's midnight release.

Several stores across the country started
 selling the game at midnight as part of a worldwide release of the 
fifth in the blockbuster series to fans eager to get their hands on one 
of the most highly-anticipated games of all time.

The attack came as the makers of Grand Theft Auto faced fresh controversy over the new game’s gruesome torture scenes.

Alison Sherratt, president of the 
Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said she was worried about the 
impact on children. She said: ‘Until now, we’ve been warning of the 
dangers of children seeing these games, but saying it’s the parents 
responsibility to keep children away from them.

‘But this scene takes things a step too far and the games makers need to consider what they are producing.

‘Children in our playgrounds display more violence. My concern is that little brother or sister walks into the room and starts watching something like this because an older brother is playing it.

‘They don’t understand the difference between reality and fiction because it’s so graphic and real, and they do copy it.

‘They imitate what they see and this scene is taking it way too far.’

The Association of Teachers and Lecturers has carried out research suggesting video games are  increasing violence among primary school-aged children.

Ms Sherratt added: ‘We’ve had children crashing into others in toy cars in the playground. When asked about it they say they’ve been watching Grand Theft Auto. They are quite open about it — children of nine and ten.’

Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the 
Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘I am astonished at the level of 
violence depicted in this game.

‘It
 is worrying that this type of content could be accessed by young 
people, particularly considering the previous links to real-life 
violence.

In demand: The 23-year-old victim was among hundreds of fans of the computer game to queue outside stores ahead of the midnight release. Customers are pictured outside Game in Westfield, Stratford

Still queuing: Dedicated gamers queue out the door at a branch of Game in Glasgow for the highly anticipated game

Open all hours: Fans around the country queued as shops opened late to mark the game's launch

‘It is important that the video game industry takes steps to inform the public about the level of extreme content.

‘Responsibility also lies with parents to ensure their children do not access these games until it is appropriate.’

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'A 23-year-old man was shopping, then on his way back home he was hit with a brick and stabbed.

'He was robbed of items he had bought from a nearby Asda supermarket including a copy of Grand Theft Auto.

'We think he was attacked on Princes Avenue by multiple suspects although it is unclear how many at this stage.'

As well as the computer game, the man's attackers also stole his watch and mobile phone.

The scene of the attack was cordoned off yesterday while police appealed for witnesses.
