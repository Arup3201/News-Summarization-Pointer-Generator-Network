 

A mother has bought the village post office where her daughter was bludgeoned to death by her husband.

Agnes Gaylor, 64, has bought the Village Shop and Post Office in Melsonby, North Yorkshire, from relatives of her former son in law, Robin Garbutt, who is currently serving life in prison for murdering her daughter, Diana Garbutt, in 2010.

Mrs Gaylor, who is thought to have paid around £130,000 for the end-of-terrace building, has said she intends to finish off work on the kitchen that was started by her daughter before her death.

Mrs Garbutt, 40, was found beaten to death in an upstairs bedroom at the three-bedroomed stone house after her husband dialled 999 and said armed robbers had burst in and attacked his wife.

Police and paramedics initially responded to a report of an armed robbery, and in the days that followed, detectives appealed for help to catch a balaclava-cald man with a gun.

However they arrested Garbutt on suspicion of murdering his wife three weeks later, and established that he had beaten her with a 30cm iron bar as she slept in the flat above the shop.

Garbutt's lies - he also said the 'raiders' had taken £10,000 from the shop - were exposed when it emerged that the couple were heavily in debt.

Teesside Crown Court also heard that the couple's marriage was on the rocks as Mrs Garbutt's libido was far stronger than her husband's, which had led her to have relationships with other men.

Jurors found Garbutt guilty of murdering his wife, and as he was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to serve at least 20 years, Mrs Garbutt's mother wept in court.

Since the killing in 2010, the property has stood empty, but now villagers question whether the former shop and post office may reopen.

It was sold at auction by Hunters in York on 30 July with a guide price of £130,000, on behalf of Mr Garbutt's estate.

His brother-in-law Mark Stilborn said: 'She [Mrs Gaylor] said she felt she had to do it because she had to finish the kitchen for Diana.

'I don't know what she wants to do with the property then.'

During Garbutt's trial in 2011, it emerged that had chatted to a friend the day before her death about the progress of a kitchen the couple were having fitted.

Bill Nixon, who runs Nixon's Garage, across the road from the post office, said there was surprise in the village that Mrs Garbutt's mother had bought the property where her daughter had died.

But he added: 'The feelings of the majority of people in Melsonby are that we want our post office and shop back.'

Mr Nixon, a parish councillor said the fate of the premises had been discussed at a recent parish council meeting, and councillors hoped to contact Mrs Gaylor to discover what she intended to do with the property. 

Mr Stilborn said the family continued to protest Garbutt's innocence and were preparing a file for the Criminal Cases Review Commission in a bid to challenge the conviction.
