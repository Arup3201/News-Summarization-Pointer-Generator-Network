A Washington state teen who wrote a chilling message in her journal before vanishing last month has been found safe at a shopping mall.

Angelic 'Anji' Dean, 17, of Camas simply left her family home on the evening of June 23 leaving behind her wallet, bank cards and glasses and vanished. Before disappearing, she had written in her diary: 'If you’re reading this, I’m either missing or dead.'

The Clark County Sheriff’s office said news coverage, phone tips and tips from social media helped lead them to find the girl at the Clackamas Town Center in Happy Valley, Oregon.

Found: Angelic 'Anji' Dean had been missing since June 23 when she walked out of her house in Washington and left behind a series of chilling journal entries and text messages

The Clark County Sheriff¿s office said news coverage, phone tips and tips from social media helped lead them to find the girl at the Clackamas Town Center in Happy Valley, Oregon

'It is clear that the local and national news coverage as well as the wide spread sharing of this family's story via social media such as Facebook and Twitter was integral in leading us to her safe return,' said Sgt. Kevin Allais, with the sheriff’s office’s major crimes unit.

'This is an active investigation that includes the crime of human trafficking. We will be continuing our investigation.'

Anji's parents also posted a message on a Help Find Anji Facebook page on which they said their daughter had been 'rescued' by cops. 

'Clark County Sheriff's Office rescued Anji this afternoon and she is okay this evening,' read the message. 'More to come, for now we thank the media, the public and the thousands of people that helped us bring our daughter home.'

Home: Anji Dean was last seen at her home in Camus, Washington at around 10pm on the evening of June 23

A Milwaukee woman, who only wanted to be identified as Jennifer, told KGW on 
Wednesday that she had spent several days with the teen and was trying 
to help her.

She said the girl asked to be called ‘Daisy,’ and said she didn’t want to be forced into doing things she did not want to.

‘She said she was in a bad situation and needed to get out,’ Jennifer said, adding that Dean left before she could help her.

Authorities have not yet released details of her condition or how she was found. They have not said exactly where she was found, either. Only that it was in Clark County.

The Clark County Sheriff's Department announced on Wednesday that Dean has been 'located and is fine'

Dean's mother discovered her daughter's journal entries which said that she was worried for her own life

In the more than two weeks that she was missing, police had asked for tips, her family posted hundreds of missing person flyers, and her mother helped spread the word nationally with a TV interview on CNN’s Nancy Grace show.

Lynda Jorgenson had previously feared that her daughter might have been a victim of sex trafficking.

The chilling diary entry wasn't found until after Anji had disappeared which left her mother convinced that her daughter knew her kidnapper.

In the months prior to vanishing the girl had told teachers and school councilors that she had gotten into something she couldn't get out of.

On the day she vanished, she had texted her boyfriend to tell him that she definitely had become involved in something nefarious and that someone was threatening to kill him and her family.

Appeal: Lynda Jorgenson, Anji's mother, said the chilling message wasn't found in Anji's journal until after she disappeared

The last time anyone had seen the teen was when she had left her large family home at around 9pm.

Police had expressed an interest in speaking to a man, described as a 25-34-year-old African American with a goatee, who had dropped her off at 4.30pm on the day she disappeared.

'We have no idea where she is or who she’s with,' Lynda Jorgensen had told KGW.com. 'She can’t be doing this on her own, so we’re really, really afraid for her.

'It scares the bejesus out of me because she didn't just run off on her own.'

Described as wearing tight fighting 
exercise clothes before she vanished, Lynda said that police had also 
discovered a cellphone that she and her Anji's father did not know their
 daughter had.
