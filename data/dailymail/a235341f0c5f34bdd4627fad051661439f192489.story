Manchester City face the ignominy of being relegated to a third-placed Champions League seeding for next season’s competition if they don’t beat Bayern Munich at home on Tuesday night.

Manuel Pellegrini’s side need victory over the German champions at the Etihad to have any hope at all of qualifying for the next stage of the tournament after losing two games and drawing two so far.

However, City also need to make sure that if they don’t qualify then they at least finish third in the group and go in to the Europa League. If they were to finish bottom, they will be in grave danger of seeing their coefficient dropping so low that they would go back to being a third seed in next summer’s draw.

It was as third seeds that City were drawn in such impossible groups in their first two years in the Champions League. This time they were a second seed and that saw them handed a group that should – in theory at least – have been a little easier.

Failure to beat Roma at home and just one point from six against CSKA Moscow, however, has left Pellegrini’s team in dire straits ahead of their game against Pep Guardiola’s outfit.

It is expected that UEFA will change the seeding system a little for next year’s competition, with the winners of the Champions League and also the winners of each of Europe’s top seven leagues automatically receiving top seed status.

City, though, would need to overhaul Chelsea and win the Barclays Premier League for that to be relevant.
