Yesterday, the European Space Agency made history when it landed its probe on the comet 67P.

The event was fraught with excitement - and nerves -  after reports the probe hadn't managed to anchor itself to the site.

For one scientist it all proved a little too much. Professor Monica Grady, who helped develop tools for the Philae probe, was filmed jumping for joy following the announcement, shouting: 'It's fantastic. It's wonderful. I've waited years for this and I'm so excited, I'm going to cry.'

At one point, the 56-year-old space scientist was so overcome with emotion, she was filmed turning and hugging BBC Science editor David Shukman, for which she later apologised.

Professor Monica Grady, who helped develop tools for Philae, was filmed jumping for joy following the landing announcement and shouted: 'It's fantastic. I've waited years for this. I'm going to cry.' At one point, she was so overcome with emotion, she was filmed hugging BBC Science editor David Shukman (pictured)

The successful landing was the result of a decade of research and development, including a 4 billion mile (6.4 billion km) journey. 

Professor Grady, from the Open University, was part of a team which developed a tool used in the project called Ptolemy.

The tool, which is the size of a shoebox, is fitted to Philae and will be used to analyse the composition of samples and gases from the 4.5 billion-year-old comet.

Once she calmed down, she said to Mr Shukman: 'Now I'll try and be a professional scientist.

'This is an amazing moment in European space agency history. It's just so wonderful, we've waited so long and now it's happening.'

Her colleague Professor Ian Wright added: ‘The idea that comets may have brought the building blocks of life to Earth is one of the reasons why we want to study them.’

Scientists hope the £1billion project will solve some of the greatest puzzles in science – including the origins of life on Earth. 

Launched in March of 2004, the Rosetta spacecraft travelled over an arching orbit, that took it beyond the orbit of Jupiter on its way to the Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.  

However, controllers revealed that because harpoons supposed to tether it to the surface had not fired, the lander may have actually bounced, effectively landing twice - and leaving it attached only by screws on its legs.

'It's complicated to land on a comet, and complicated to understand what has happened during this landing,' said Dr Stefan Ulamec, Philae Lander Manager.

The probe separated from the craft yesterday morning, and at the European Space Agency’s mission control in Germany, a faint radio signal came back from the lander at 4pm GMT.

The probe separated from the craft yesterday morning, and  a faint radio signal came back from the lander at 4pm GMT. There were fears that Philae was unstable, after thrusters and anchoring harpoons failed to fire. But, earlier this morning Esa announced it had made contact with the probe, and released this image

At mission control in Germany, the news of the landing was greeted with jubilation and high emotion by staff on the project. It is thought Philae is currently resting on the surface of the comet but its orientation is unknown Mark Bentley, the Principal Investigator on Rosetta's Midas instrument, told MailOnline

This was the proof the team needed that it had finally reached the surface of the comet. 

Dr Stephan Ulamec, who ran the audacious landing programme, said early tests suggested the craft had bounced softly before turning and settling again. 

He said: ‘It touched down and was re-bouncing. So maybe we didn’t just land, we landed twice.’

There were fears last night that Philae was unstable, after the landing thrusters and anchoring harpoons failed to fire.

However, earlier this morning Esa announced it had made contact with the probe - but questions still remain about how secure it is.

It is thought Philae is currently resting on the surface of the comet but its orientation is unknown and there is a 'chance it is on its side', Mark Bentley, the Principal Investigator on Rosetta's Midas instrument, told MailOnline. 

‘From what we’ve heard overnight it seems there is a suspicion yesterday that there was some bouncing involved.

‘Two instruments have confirmed Philae appears to have touched down followed by two subsequent touchdowns effectively.

Rosetta has chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years in what has been described as 'the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever'

The lander announced its arrival with this historic tweet following its ten-year mission. Launched in March of 2004, the Rosetta spacecraft travelled over an arching orbit, that took it beyond the orbit of Jupiter on its way

The lander was dropped from a height of 13.6 miles (21.8 km). This image shows comet 67P/CG from a distance of approximately 1.8 miles (3km) from the surface

‘So the fact we’re now getting data back from the orbiter looks good, it suggests the lander is stable on the surface.

The probe bounced twice on the surface after the landing yesterday, once to a height of 0.62 miles (1km), before coming to rest on the comet.

Dr Stefan Ulamec, Philae Lander Manager said: ‘Did we just land in a soft-sand box and everything is fine? Or is there something else happening? We still do not fully understand what has happened.’

British scientist Dr Matt Taylor, who played a key role in the mission, said: ‘To see this mountaineering effort, that we’ve descended a lander to the surface of a comet, I can’t put words to it. It’s beautiful.’ 

And the expert was so confident of success that he had even had an image of the space probe tattooed on his right leg.

There were fears last night that Philae was unstable, after landing thrusters and anchoring harpoons failed to fire. However, earlier this morning Esa announced it had made contact with the probe - but questions still remain about how secure it is

When Philae touched the surface of the comet it fired harpoons into the surface to keep it anchored there.

To keep it attached to the surface a thruster at the top was meant to push it down as the harpoons fired.

But before the launch, the thruster didn't appear to be working - and it was confirmed the harpoons didn't fire.

This meant the lander may have had to rely solely on screws on its legs. 

The surface was much softer than they expected, so there were some concerns that Philae was not securely fixed on the comet - although from a software point of view things seemed to be fine.

However, earlier this morning Esa announced it had made contact with the probe - but questions still remain about how secure it is.

It is thought Philae is currently resting on the surface of the comet but its orientation is unknown and there is a 'chance it is on its side', Mark Bentley, the Principal Investigator on Rosetta's Midas instrument, told MailOnline. 

‘From what we’ve heard overnight it seems there is a suspicion yesterday that there was some bouncing involved.

‘Two instruments have confirmed Philae appears to have touched down followed by two subsequent touchdowns effectively. 

Before the attempt yesterday, there was also a good luck message from a man who had once boasted of boldly going into space himself. 

Star Trek actor William Shatner sent the team a video in which the 83-year-old said: ‘Good luck Rosetta, Philae’s gonna land.’

One scientist then described the seven hours of ‘terror’ they went through to drop the Philae lander 13.6 miles above the comet from its mothership, Rosetta. 

Much of the equipment aboard the lander was switched on for the first time after lying dormant during the ten-year journey.

Klim Churyumov, one of the Ukrainians who discovered the comet 45 years ago and named it, said from mission control in Darmstadt, Germany: ‘We saw the first light from this comet in 1969, now we are landing on it. It is a fantastic, outstanding event, the first like it in human civilization.’

The probe is equipped with cameras, a suite of ten instruments, and a drill that can bore out samples to a depth of nine inches.
