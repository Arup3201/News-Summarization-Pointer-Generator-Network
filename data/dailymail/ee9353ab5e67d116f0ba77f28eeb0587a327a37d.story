This is the terrifying moment bus passengers were caught in the path of an oncoming freight train after the driver ignored warning lights and ended up on a level crossing.

The City Red bus was stranded across a hatched yellow box in Southampton, Hampshire, as the goods train hurtled towards it and coming to a halt just yards away.

The incident is now at the centre of an investigation by the British Transport Police and bosses at First UK Bus, which runs the service.

This is the horrifying moment a freight train almost collides with a bus after it's caught on a level crossing

It is thought the driver of the City Red bus ignored red flashing danger lights and loud sirens as it sat in traffic

The train driver, who had just dropped cargo off at Southampton docks, was forced to slam on the brakes 

It is thought the driver of the number 11 bus ignored red flashing danger lights and loud sirens as he sat in a queue of traffic on Canute Road.

And when the tailbacks failed to shift, his vehicle and its helpless passengers were left on the tracks of the advancing freight train.

The cargo train had just offloaded 36 carriages of various goods at Southampton docks and was making its return journey.

The terrifying moment was captured by Bradley Hurrion, 17, from Hythe near the city.

The train slowly approached the crossing as sirens blared and people waited to cross and was able to halt

He said: ‘It is quite alarming. I was just wondering whether the bus was going to stop and was worried for the welfare of the passengers.’

Bus chiefs have admitted their vehicle should have never entered the boxed junction at the level crossing.

A First UK Bus spokesman said the fact a driver entered the area without being able to clear it immediately, as the Highway Code insists, was something ‘of concern to us’.

A statement said: ‘We are extremely concerned at what we have seen on this footage.

‘We have launched an immediate investigation into what happened. Safety is one of our highest priorities.

‘While thankfully this incident did not result in a collision, we will conduct a thorough investigation into what happened and will then take whatever action is deemed appropriate as a result.”

The horrifying moment was captured on camera by young rail enthusiast Bradley Hurrion (above)

Mr Hurrion, a rail enthusiast, also filmed another close shave at a Hampshire level crossing.

On that occasion a cyclist in Hythe can be seen narrowly missing a falling barrier coming down to allow a fuel train, which was leaving Fawley oil refinery, pass by.

His footage has since prompted rail police to launch a national safety campaign called Operation Look.

In a bid to raise more awareness of railway dangers, extra patrols are also under way at crossings throughout Hampshire.

South West Trains said between April 1, 2013 and March 31 this year, eight motorists were charged or summoned for crossing misuse, with a further 69 issued with fixed penalty notices, and 22 cautioned for traffic offences.

A further 290 drivers were sent on safety-awareness courses.

Inspector Becky Warren said: ‘It is important people realise there is a serious penalty to pay for crossing-misuse.

‘However, while we will not hesitate to use the force of the law, we are also acutely aware of the need to promote safety at crossings through education.

‘We need drivers and pedestrians to realise level crossing misuse is a danger, not only to their safety, but the safety of others.’
