Should FIFA ban Luis Suarez after latest bite storm?

As FIFA’s disciplinary chiefs began their investigation into Luis Suarez’s shameful bite on Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini, it became apparent the Liverpool striker was in danger of losing lucrative sponsorship deals.

Suarez is sponsored by adidas and executives from the sportswear manufacturer met in Rio to discuss the latest incident.

The official statements from his sponsors were anodyne, but Sportsmail understands the striker could be jettisoned.

An adidas spokesperson said: ‘adidas is aware of the issue involving Luis Suarez. We await FIFA’s full investigation into this matter and will respond accordingly.’

Gambling company 888poker have Suarez as a brand ambassador and said: ‘Following recent allegations made against Luis Suarez, we are reviewing our relationship with him. We will not tolerate unsporting behaviour.’

The investigation was ongoing on Wednesday night, but video evidence appeared to be damning.

The independent disciplinary panel, chaired by Swiss lawyer Claudio Sulser, had a range of sanctions available up to a 24-match ban or a two-year suspension from all football. A worldwide ban would impact on his career at Liverpool, but there is no precedent for such a sanction.

It is unclear whether Suarez’s previous bans — 10 games for biting Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic and seven matches for biting PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal — would be taken into consideration, but the panel do have that power.

Liverpool shirt sponsors Standard Chartered also commented: 'Given the ongoing investigation, this is currently a matter for FIFA.'
