She was once so famous for flashing her cleavage while digging, she was nicknamed 'horticultural Viagra'.

Now almost a decade after Charlie Dimmock's show Ground Force ended, she fears she'll never live down her reputation as 'the bra-less one'.

Miss Dimmock became known for going without support and bending towards the camera on the BBC1 show.

She said: 'It was all very silly. I remember Esther Rantzen said to me, "You'll be referred to as the bra-less one for the rest of your life. I'm still referred to as the buck-toothed presenter of That's Life".

'People still comment on it to me. Some of them are male fans, some of them are female.

'It is sometimes just more comfortable not having a bra on. I didn't plan it.'

Miss Dimmock, 47, will present an episode of Great British Garden Revival, which returns to BBC2 next Monday at 7pm.
