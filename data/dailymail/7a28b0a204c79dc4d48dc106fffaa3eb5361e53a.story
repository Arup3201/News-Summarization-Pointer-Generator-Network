Proud Scot Susan Boyle today came out strongly against independence.

The Britain’s Got Talent singer, who still lives in her hometown of Blackburn, West Lothian, revealed she will be voting No on Thursday.

Miss Boyle, 53-year-old said you should not break what is ‘basically working’

Proud Scot Susan Boyle, seen here performing at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, has come out strongly against independence

Writing in the Sunday Mirror, Miss Boyle said: ‘Money that should be spent on hospitals, schools and vulnerable people will be swallowed up by bureaucracy.

‘If prices of essentials go up how will people cope?

‘And what will become of welfare? It helps many of the most vulnerable in society.’

Miss Boyle also said she had concerns over what would happen to the British military, in which her father ‘proudly’ served.

She added: ‘Also what happens to our currency? Before you know it we will end up in a similar situation to Ireland.

‘But my biggest concern is the economic cost to the country and the proud Scottish people.

‘I don't feel reassured that the change will in any way make our already great country better. We should not be wasting money on this change - we should be putting it into areas that need it the most.'

In a blow to First Minister Alex Salmond, Miss Boyle said she had fears over the economic future of an independent Scotland

Miss Boyle still lives in the same hpouse in Blackburn, West Lothian, where she grew up,  despite her global success, so unlike many high profile Scottish celebrities is entitled to a vote in the referendum

Earlier this week, Miss Boyle reaffirmed her commitment to Scotland by purchasing the property next door in Blackburn, which she refuses to leave despite her global success.

She splashed out £110,000 on the semi-detached house, which was reportedly valued at £30,000 less, to ensure that she can build her dream home.

It is expected the two homes will be combined to create a spacious six-bedroomed home.
