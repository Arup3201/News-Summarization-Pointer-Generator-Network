The shell casing of a bullet was found in a car rented by former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez on the day he is accused of murdering Odin Lloyd.

Keelia Smyth, former manager of an Enterprise rental car branch in North Attleborough, Boston, told the court on Wednesday that Hernandez returned a damaged Nissan Altima on the afternoon of June 17, 2013.

In it, she says, was something she believed to be a bullet stuck to a piece of chewed blue gum and a child's drawing.

Hernandez had offered her a piece of blue gum before he left, she said.

The testimony came as police were questioned over their handling of evidence, which has been a crucial element of the trial.

Accused: Aaron Hernandez allegedly left the casing of a bullet in his rental car after the death of Odin Lloyd

Enterprise worker Keelia Smyth told Bristol County Superior Court on Wednesday about her alleged finding

'Evidence': This is a picture shown to the court on Wednesday of the casing police recovered on June 20

Smyth told the court Hernandez made no attempt to conceal his identity when he returned the car on June 18, asking for an SUV instead.

When she cleaned the car, she said, there was a 'bullet' stuck to a piece of blue chewing gum, and a child's drawing. 

Before Hernandez left, she says, he offered her a piece of blue gum, which she declined. 

She threw it all in the trash but when she heard of Hernandez's arrest, called police describing her alleged discovery, the Boston Globe reported.

Officers said they found a .45-caliber shell casing, chewing gum, and a child's drawing in the dumpster on June 20.

The court also heard from Hernandez's uncle who said the player was upset about losing his endorsements

The items were placed in the bed of a State Police pick-up truck - a move which both the prosecution and defense teams have criticized.  

'It was just a dirty old pickup truck, right?' defense lawyer James Sultan asked police detective Michael Elliott. 'Has anyone ever taught you to collect evidence that way, sir?'

'No,' Elliott said. 

Hernandez is charged with the June 17, 2013, killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. 

Odin Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial park in June 2013. 

Requested an SUV: She said Hernandez returned the car asking for an SUV on June 18, 2013

Resuming the murder trial on Wednesday, prosecution first heard from Ms Smyth, who said Hernandez first rented the Nissan Altima on June 10, 2013.

She said he requested an SUV when he returned it on June 18. Smyth claims she offered him a Kia Soul, as no SUVs were available, but Hernandez replied that 'he couldn't be seen dead in that'. 

He took a Chrysler 300.  

Hernandez, 25, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was arrested on murder and firearms charges. The team cut him hours later. 

Police have yet to find the gun in question, which is proving to be a major set back for both defense and prosecution. 

In a blow to prosecution, Bristol Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ruled on Wednesday that Hernandez's friend Robert Paradis could not testify that he knew about the gun.

He took to the stand in absence of the jury to clarify that police had overstretched his comments in their report, and that he couldn't be sure of Hernandez's connection to a .45 caliber gun.

It was believed Hernandez had told Paradis he owned a .45 caliber gun.

Paradis admitted that he cannot recall if it was specifically .45 caliber, and that he never saw the gun in question.
