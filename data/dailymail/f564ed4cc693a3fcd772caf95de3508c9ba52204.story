A former Michigan high school football coach was arrested Friday and faces multiple charges including sending explicit images to students as young as 13 years old.

Louis Michael Rau, 46, faces 12 charges including seven counts of distributing sexually explicit matter to a minor; four counts of selling or furnishing alcohol to a minor; and one count of accosting a minor for immoral purposes -- which is a four-year felony, the Morning Sun reports.

Rau resigned from his position at the Beal City High School in January after complaints from parents about the coach's alleged inappropriate conduct led to an investigation by the Isabella County Sheriff's Department.

Multiple Charges: Louis Rau, 46 (photographed), was arrested Friday and faces multiple charges including sending explicit images to students as young as 13 years old 

During the investigation, the department conducted several interviews and searched phones, tablets, cameras, computers, DVD's, text messages and emails, Sheriff Leo Mioduszewski told MLive. 

The search found that Rau sent nude photos to five victims -- all student-athletes -- between 2011 and 2015, People reports. 

One of the victims was 13 when the ex-coach began sending him the sexually explicit photos, and all of the others were under 18 years old.

Court records obtained by the Sun state that in addition to the photos, Rau gave the boys sex toys. Rau reportedly once gave an eighth grader a toy 'described as a vagina with a tube.'

On four different occasions, the Sun reports, Rau purchased alcohol for three of the victims; court records note that both text messages and Rau's admission confirmed the purchases.

At Friday's arraignment, Rau's attorney, Dan O'Neill, described Rau as a 'home-grown boy' and noted that the 46-year-old had no criminal record, the Sun reports.

He spoke of Rau's notoriety as 'the most celebrated football coach Beal City has ever had.' 

Rau's bail was set at $80,000, lowered from $120,000 which was set during the time of his arrest, the Sun reports.

Upon his resignation, Rau, who also served as a substitute teacher at the school, was banned from school grounds except for school board meetings and public elections held at the school, MLive reports.

As part of his bail conditions, Rau is not allowed in any school zones, not allowed to be in the presence of minors, not allowed to attend sporting events where minors or present, and is not allowed to contact the victims in any way, according to MLive.  

In 2006, Rau received a 14-day unpaid suspension for allegedly slapping a player at a football banquet.

An investigation into the incident was launched after a concerned parent of a former-player wrote a letter detailing the July 2006 incident, saying several football players saw Rau slap the student in the face.

'When I asked [the victim] about the incident myself, he said that, 'Yes. Mr. Rau b**** slapped me,'' the letter reads. 

A Beal City High School graduate, Rau began coaching at the school in 2000 and led the team to a state championship in 2009. 

Rau posted bail shortly after his arraignment Friday and is scheduled to appear in court Thursday for a probable cause hearing.
