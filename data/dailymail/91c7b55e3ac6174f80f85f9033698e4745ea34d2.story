Prince Harry is secretly dating Emma Watson after sending her an email to invite her out when she split from her boyfriend.

At least that's according to a completely unconfirmed Australian magazine report, which quotes a breathless unnamed insider as saying that the fourth-in-line to the throne is 'smitten'.

The report from supermarket aisle magazine Woman's Day has sent the internet rumour mill into overdrive and it has been picked up - rather skeptically - by websites around the world.

Now this is power-dressing at its very finest; and we couldn’t think of a better Hollywood actress (bar Angelina Jolie) to pull off a tuxedo suit better than our very own Emma Watson. Now it's time to  man up and wear one for ourselves…

The Harry Potter star played up to her androgynous side in a Maiyet Pre Fall 2015 tailored suit which showcased her incredible figure without swamping her petite frame, and we’re loving the velvet lapel detailing and double breasted design. She's definitely got a magic touch with fashion, and we're pretty sure she's not in possession of a wand.

Tuxedo blazers (and suits in general) have been all the rage this autumn/winter, from Jennifer Aniston in her red Gucci two-piece at the Golden Globes to Angie in her perpetual Saint Laurent all-black version, celebs can’t get enough of the boy-meets-girl trend and us mere mortals are catching on.

A tux style jacket is particularly handy in the colder months as you can layer it over rollnecks or shirts and underneath a big overcoat and still look super suave for the office.  Although you can’t buy Emma’s exact jacket just yet, you can take a look the similar styles below or check out Maiyet’s current collection at Avenue 32 with a click to the right. The choice is yours!

The fourth in line to the throne, pictured arriving at a film premiere earlier this month, is said to have asked Miss Watson on a date

Miss Watson met Prince William last year during a dinner to celebrate the work of the Royal Marsden

According to Woman's Day, Harry, 30, asked the Harry Potter star out after hearing she had broken up with previous boyfriend Matthew Janney in December last year.

Apparently, Miss Watson met with the prince with a group of 12 friends and they have been meeting up in secret since.

The 'insider' apparently told the magazine: 'Harry didn't want her to feel like she was put on the spot,” explains one insider. “A party also shows he’s fun and not stuffy.'

'He’s smitten – and it’s more than Emma’s looks.'

The rumour was met with a predictable flood of Harry Potter jokes. One Twitter wag said: 'Emma Watson is dating Prince Harry! Despite JK Rowling's best efforts, Hermione is finally hooking up with Harry!'

Another said: 'I hope Prince Harry and Emma Watson last because if they have a son, it will be the half-blood prince.'

While Miss Watson, 24, and the Prince have not been pictured together before, she has already met his brother the Duke of Cambridge, as well as Prince Charles. 

Prince Harry broke up with Cressida Bonas in April last year after a two-year on-off relationship ended amicably.

The Prince was introduced to her by Princess Eugenie in 2012, with the couple's last public outing together coming at an England rugby match a month before they split.

Before that, Harry dated Chelsy Davy, with the pair breaking up in 2010 after a turbulent six-year relationship.

Prince Harry's first serious relationship was with Chelsy Davy, who he dated on-off for about six years

After suggestions that the pair were set to get back together emerged in 2011, Prince Harry said her was '100 per cent single'.

Despite this, Miss Davy was invited to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in April that year. 

Miss Watson - who played Hermione in the Harry Potter series - broke up with Oxford University rugby player Matthew Janney in December.

The couple, who dated for a year, went their separate ways due to Emma's unrelenting work schedule but said they were determined to remain friends.

Miss Watson dated Will Adamowicz for two years and was pictured embracing him at Coachella Music festival in 2012

The Perks of Being a Wallflower star's relationship with Mr Janney came not long after her split from long-term boyfriend Will Adamowicz.

Miss Watson, who is now a UN Goodwill Ambassador, met Mr Adamowicz in his first year at Oxford, where she studied for a year as a visiting student.

While the couple did their best to stay out of the public eye, they were seen embracing at Coachella music festival in 2012 and he joined her at the 2013 MTV Movie Awards.

A Clarence House spokeswoman said: 'Prince Harry's private life is private. We would not confirm or deny that.'
