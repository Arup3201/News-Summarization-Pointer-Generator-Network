Sterilization, or tube-tying, is on its way to overtake the birth control pill as the most popular form of female contraception.

According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 62per cent of U.S. women between 15 and 44 use some form of birth control.

Among those, 16per cent were on the Pill between 2011 and 2013, and following close behind was the 15.5per cent of women who chose female sterilization.

On the rise: According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, female sterilization or tube-tying may soon overtake the Pill as women's preferred form of birth control

Sterilization involves surgically or non-surgically blocking or cutting a woman's Fallopian tubes, making her permanently unable to get pregnant. 

When a woman undergoes tubal ligation, her tubes are either cut and tied or sealed with an electrical current, clamps or rings.

Another option is to put tiny inserts into the tubes, causing tissue to grow around them and block the tubes. The brand name for this type of sterilization is Essure.

Since it has a nearly 100per cent success rate, it's an especially popular option among middle-aged women who have already had as many children as they want.

Dr Vanessa Cullins, vice president of external medical affairs at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, talked to Time about the findings.

'Consider the fact that the majority of women in this country have had the number of children they want to have by [their] mid-20s to 30, or so,' she said.

'And they still have the capacity to get pregnant until they are 50 years old.'

Unlike methods of birth control that require maintenance, like condoms or the Pill, sterilization is seen as the more reliable way to ensure that women do not fall pregnant ever again. 

Women are also aware that the health risks of pregnancy increase after the age of 30, causing them to seek out a permanent solution.

The study found the male condoms are the third most popular form of contraceptive, with 9.4per cent of couples using them during sex.

In last place were long-acting reversible contraceptives such as Intrauterine devices, or IUDs, with 7.2per cent. 

IUDs were most popular among women between the ages of 25 and 34, with 11.1per cent choosing an IUD as their preferred method of birth control.

Only 5per cent of females aged 15 to 24 used IUDs, and 5.3per cent of those between 35 and 44 said the same.
