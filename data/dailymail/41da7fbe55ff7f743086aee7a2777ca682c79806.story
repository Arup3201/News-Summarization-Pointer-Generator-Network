A Microsoft contractor is alleged to have filmed up the skirts of dozens of women after setting up a hidden camera at the company's headquarters.

Leonard 'Leo' Raymundo has been charged with two felony counts of voyeurism after investigators found videos of 93 women on the 34-year-old's recording devices.

Raymundo, 34, had been contracted to work at Microsoft's main campus in Redmond, Washington when he filmed the invasive videos.

King County prosecutors allege that the software employee positioned a small camera on a pathway so that it pointed up the skirts of women who walked past, according to Seattle PI.

The camera was discovered by another Microsoft employee who passed the device along to  company security who then handed it over to the Redmond Police Department.

Raymundo was caught out because he managed to film himself while setting up the camera on July 24 last year. No victims have been identified.

Police searched Raymundo's computer and found videos taken with a hidden camera. He allegedly admitted to filming 'up skirts' during a police interview days after the camera as discovered.

Senior Deputy Prosecutor Carla Carlstrom told the court that Raymundo set up his camera where he could capture the most victims and then loaded the videos onto his work computer 'without apparent fear of consequences'. 

A Redmond detective told Seattle PI: 'ln the videos, I noted that Raymundo employs the use of stairs, escalators or checkout lines as an excuse to be within close range of the female victims without arousing their suspicion.'

MailOnline was awaiting a statement from the Redmond Police Department.
