The guest list of old boys who gathered earlier this month for the bicentenary of The Eton Society read like a Who's Who of some of the most illustrious and wealthy members of British society.

Mingling in a marquee on the lawn known as Fellows' Eyot, they shared anecdotes about their membership of the school's most prestigious club, known as 'Pop', a self-electing group of the most popular and sporty sixth-formers.

Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, was there, along with Douglas Hurd and William Waldegrave, Jonathan Aitken, Lord Vestey, racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks and Sir William Gladstone - great-grandson of the Prime Minister whose name he bears.

Now: Sibling rivalry pushed David Cameron to become Prime Minister

So, too, was Alexander Cameron QC, older brother of our current Prime Minister - whose absence from this select group was the cause of much amusement among those present.

For it was not that David Cameron was unavailable that night. He wasn't even eligible. While his older brother had been a member of Pop at school, David never made the grade.

Which is why, at the end of a £250-a-head dinner, Boris Johnson joked that those who weren't elected to Pop were sometimes so damaged by their feelings of rejection they acquired a burning ambition to become Prime Minister to make up for the humiliation.

It was a gentle quip, but one which might well have hit a raw nerve with the PM had he heard it. In an interview this week, he opened up about the sibling rivalry which dogged his childhood, describing Alex, at 47 three years his senior, as a 'huge success' on the sports field and 'almost always lead actor' in school plays.

His comments came in the latest issue of the Big Issue magazine, which the Prime Minister guest edited. He spoke about his childhood for one of the magazine's columns: 'Letter to my younger self.'

'I lived in the shadow of my older brother,' Mr Cameron admitted. 'He was three years older, went to the same school and was a huge success. It was great to have that kind of role model and I was incredibly proud of him, but like many younger brothers you find yourself always a few steps behind.'

So who is the brother who once cast such a shadow on the PM? He is Allan Alexander Cameron, a man who, as one of Britain's top barristers, has worked on some of the most high-profile legal cases of recent years.

He successfully fought the extradition of General Pinochet, defended Jonathan Aitken and Jeffrey Archer in their perjury trials, and recently defended Pakistani cricketer Mohammad Asif against allegations of match-fixing.

Said to earn more than £1 million a year, Alex Cameron was just 39 when he took silk as a Queen's Counsel and is described by law guide Chambers UK as a 'phenomenon' with 'enthralling advocacy skills' and a 'delightful bedside manner'.

Married to fellow barrister Sarah Fearnley-Whittingstall, cousin of chef Hugh, he has two children, Imogen, 19, and 17-year-old old Angus.

Alex is clearly as driven towards success as his brother. The family resemblance is also unmistakable, although Alex is silver-haired and a little fuller-figured.

Their competitive streak stems back to their childhood in a former rectory near Newbury, Berkshire. Alex is the eldest of the four children born to wealthy stockbroker Ian Cameron and his wife, Mary. A daughter, Tania, followed. David was the third-born, his sister Clare is the youngest.

David followed his brother to Greenwood pre-preparatory school near Newbury. His biographers, Frances Elliott and James Hanning, in Cameron, The Rise Of The New Conservative, say it was during these years that the seeds of sibling rivalry were sown over fiercely competitive games of tennis and cricket.

For the latter sport they organised annual matches between teams captained by each of the brothers.

In 1974, aged seven, David was sent to board at Heatherdown prep school near Ascot in Berkshire, a feeder school for Eton, following in the footsteps of his older, often more successful, brother.

A few months later, both brothers appeared in a school production of Toad Of Toad Hall watched by, among other parents, the Queen and Prince Philip, who were there to see 11-year-old Prince Edward performing as Mole. Alex, one of Edward's closest friends at school and already marked out for his fine acting and public speaking skills, had the coveted role of Rat. David, was given a smaller part, listed in the programme as 'Harold Rabbit'.

High-powered: The brothers at their day jobs

Both brothers played for the school's cricket First XI, although contemporary accounts recall it was Alex who shone as a sportsman.

But it was at Eton, where David arrived in 1979, that he really felt the burden of a successful and talented older brother. A contemporary says: 'Alex was always the one mothers would want their daughters to marry. He was effortlessly charming and debonaire - very much the natural head boy type.

'If you'd had to vote then for which of the two brothers you thought might become Prime Minister, it would have been Alex every time.'

Not least because Alex Cameron was also an instant academic success, while David, a late developer, traipsed behind somewhat.

However it was Cameron junior's failure to get into Pop that must have really hurt. Those chosen are entitled to wear a special uniform: a black tail coat with braid piping, spongebag trousers in a houndstooth check, a starched wing collar with a white bow tie and a waistcoat made from any fabric they desired.

According to Old Etonian Bill Coles, who was the year below Alex and two years above David at the £30,000-a-year school: 'Not getting into Pop was one hell of a big deal. It would have been a complete slap in the face for David and probably goes in part to explain his ambitions as a politician.'

Coles, author of the spoof novel David Cameron's Schooldays, points out that the high-octane atmosphere at Eton would have placed the brothers in direct competition.

'Even without an older brother who is doing well, it would have been highly competitive,' says Coles. 'The school was full of alpha males. David and Alex were in the same house. And younger brothers are always left in the shadow of older brothers. David may well have left school feeling he had an awful lot still to prove.'

School days: It was at Eton that Davis Cameron really felt the pressure of having a successful older brother

Immediately after school, Cameron followed in Alex's footsteps again, heading to Hong Kong for three months to work for the Jardine Matheson shipping agency.

By now, Alex was studying law at Bristol University. And here, at last, David got one up on him - winning a place at Oxford to read politics, philosophy and economics. Thanks, in part, to their late father's work ethic and high standards, both were determined to succeed in their chosen fields.

As David told the Big Issue: 'If I could give my younger self some advice, I'd say: "Don't worry about it. Your life is not pre-determined. You'll find your own feet in your own way." It was not until I left school that I felt I was breaking out of my brother's shadow.'

As David found his feet on his long climb up the political ladder, Alex moved into his childhood family home with his wife and children, while Ian and Mary Cameron moved into a smaller, adjacent house.

Ian Cameron once said that his sons had 'completely separate roles'. Certainly, sibling rivalry, or 'younger brother syndrome' as David once put it, has never got in the way of family loyalties. The brothers have always been close.

Alex encouraged David to enter the Conservative leadership race, apparently saying: 'You've got to go for it.'

Yet even when it came to reaching the peaks of their professions, Alex got there first. Just weeks before David became Prime Minister, Alex was voted head of his chambers at Three Raymond Buildings.

'A man for the big occasion,' is how his peers describe him. 'Hardworking and very solid in his approach'; 'universally loved'. Characteristics that would have made him a fine Prime Minister, if he had chosen politics instead of the law.

Perhaps David should count himself lucky that so far Alex has confined his political interests to a more modest stage: he is chairman of his parish council.

Burning issues of late have included whether to replace towels with hand-dryers in the village pavilion and whether a bus stop would be an unsightly addition to the parish.

With the weight of the nation's woes upon him in his great office of State, David may no longer feel overshadowed by his big brother - but what's the betting there aren't days when he still envies him?
