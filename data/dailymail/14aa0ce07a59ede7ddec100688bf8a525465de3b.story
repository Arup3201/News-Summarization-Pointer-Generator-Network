It had a prince, a Harry Potter castle and even a crowd of pixies. But the Royal Wedding of the North – as yesterday’s nuptials between Prince William’s oldest friend Thomas van Straubenzee and Lady Melissa Percy were dubbed – was surely dominated by the ‘battle of the blondes’.

In one corner of Alnwick Castle was maid of honour Chelsy Davy, former long-time love of Prince Harry. In the other was guest Cressida Bonas, the beautiful dancer who is his current on-off girlfriend.

It was the first public meeting of the prince’s only two serious loves – and all eyes were on the pair to see who would triumph in the war for Harry’s affections.

Don't upstage the bride! The high society wedding was eagerly watched by many Alnwick residents, who turned out in their droves to watch the lavish ceremony and high-profile guests, including a stunning Chelsy Davy and the mother of the bride, Jane Percy

Chelsy, who dated Harry from 2005 to 2010, is the best friend of Lady Melissa – Missy to her friends.

Missy is the youngest daughter of the
 Duke and Duchess of Northumberland and is known as the ‘Hogwarts 
heiress’ because her family seat is Alnwick Castle, where the first two 
Harry Potter films were shot and where yesterday’s celebrations took 
place.

As one of Missy’s 12 bridesmaids, Chelsy wore a gold, floor-length gown embellished with gems.

Cressida, who began seeing  Harry last
 year and was pictured embracing him on the ski slopes in February, wore
 a floaty maxi-dress and a sequined navy jacket.

Friends said the 24-year-old was extremely nervous at the prospect of meeting Harry’s old flame.

One said: ‘She is totally intimidated
 by Chelsy. She’s very tight with Missy and in the wedding party, so it 
feels like she’s on Chelsy’s territory.

She knows Harry still carries a major
 torch for Chelsy – she’s always felt that there’s a ‘‘ghost of Chelsy’’
 in their relationship.’

Yesterday’s wedding was a potentially 
awkward occasion because Chelsy is currently single after splitting from
 her latest boyfriend, property developer Matthew Mills – Labour grandee
 Dame Tessa Jowell’s son. Sources claim she and Harry have been back in 
touch recently.

There has even been a rumour that he 
has been spotted outside her flat, although friends said the pair were 
planning to avoid one another yesterday.

The Duke of Cambridge, who was joint 
best man, and Prince Harry, an usher, joined guests for the wedding at 
St Michael’s Church, Alnwick, followed by a reception in the grand State
 Rooms of the imposing 1,000-year-old castle.

With the Duchess of Cambridge due to 
give birth next month, she remained at home in London – although her 
sister Pippa was there, wearing a white peplum dress  with a black 
marble pattern by Tabitha Webb, black patent heels and a black hat.

Appropriately for a Hogwarts wedding, 
the bridal party also included fairies and pixies, in the form of little
 flower boys and girls, clad all in green.   

Thomas van Straubenzee, 30, known as 
Van, has been one of Prince William’s closest friends since they met at 
Ludgrove prep school.

Hong Kong.

The bride wore a romantic dress with a lace bodice and flowing organza skirt by Bruce Oldfield.

The £3,000-a-head reception began at 
Alnwick Castle before continuing in a marquee and concluding with a 
fireworks display accompanied by music.
