They say age is just a number and one lively pensioner is proof of that.

76-year-old Helen Flannigan has become one of the most famous faces on the fitness scene teaching as many as 12 classes a week because she just 'loves the buzz of exercise'.

Helen, from Edinburgh, Scotland, teaches a range of classes from Bodyattack and line dancing to Sh'Bam and circuits.

Fighting fit: 76-year-old Helen Flannigan has become one of the most famous faces on the fitness scene teaching as many as 12 classes a week

'It gives me a real buzz and adrenaline rush,' she said.

'Exercise adds to your life. It's really important and stands you 
in good stead for later years.

'A few years ago I had some cartilage 
removed from my knees, and I was out of action for a few weeks – it was 
awful.

'But get this, the doctor said I had brilliant knees - I was 70! 
How many 70-year-olds can say they have brilliant knees?.'

Helen, who works for fitness brand Les Mills, is an inspiration to people of all
ages, with those attending her classes ranging from age 18 to 80.

Helen first gained her fitness instructing qualifications back in 1986.

Prior to that she was working as a manager of a health and fitness club but wanted to be more involved in the physical side of things so began teaching classes.

'I was the first person to bring Body Pump to Edinburgh and maybe even the whole of Scotland,' she said.

Speaking about the importance of exercise and how she motivates her clients, Helen said: 'They're finding more and more evidence 
that keeping fit keeps you young. I get a lot of seniors in my classes 
and it's great to see.

'The problem is, a 
lot of older people are scared to go into gyms. I work so hard to be 
encouraging. Good instructors are always there to guide you and motivate
you.'

Helen says she never gets tired and questions: 'who uses the word retirement these days?'.

'I 
love my job, I really do. The community aspect is what is so special - 
it's like being with your friends or even having another family.'

Helen believes her classes are different to normal classes.

She said: 'I've
been to a number of exercise classes where I've felt like the outsider,
and it's just not nice.

'That's why I work really hard to make everybody
who comes to my classes feel comfortable and included. The trick is to 
get cheeky with them and add a bit of personality.

'If a white-haired 
lady can do it, you can do it – that's what I tell them!'

Healthy lifestyle: Helen is from a sporty family, her husband is a golfer and her son a golf instructor

As well as regularly exercising, Helen maintains a healthy lifestyle, but she doesn't restrict herself.

'I'm just a normal person who enjoys fitness. I don't have a strict diet. I'm Scottish so I love porridge and blueberries but by Jove, if you give me a cupcake, I'll eat one!,' she said.

Helen says that the next big craze to take the fitness world by storm is 30-minute high intensity interval training. 'This is a great way of exercising, people are so busy nowadays.'

On her days off teaching, she can't keep away from her local gym and even attends classes in her spare time.

Youthful: She often gets complimented on how young she looks, which she enjoys

She also works in a local nursing home teaching residents gentle stretches and exercises.

Helen, whose husband is a golfer and son an instructor, is regularly complemented on her youthful looks.

She said: 'I do get people complimenting me on how young I look, which is nice.

'I get people come into my class and say: "My mother remembers you!" and now I have people saying "My grandmother remembers you, are you still going?".'
