A California woman suspected in the shooting death of her longtime girlfriend was fatally shot by police over the weekend after she pulled a gun on the officers as they were on routine patrol in an alley in Santa Ana.

However, it turns out that the gun 35-year-old Jessica Gonzalez pulled on officers was just a toy, and friends of the slain woman believe her death was the result of suicide-by-cop.

According to authorities, a woman - later identified by her family and friends as Gonzalez - approached two patrol officers with a gun in an alley in the 800 block of South Townsend Street.

Fearing for their lives, the officers opened fire on Gonzalez. She was taken to a local hospital where she later was pronounced dead.

Gonzalez had been on the run after fatally shooting her girlfriend of 13 years, 44-year-old Jennifer Solorio, outside of the apartment the couple shared on Thursday afternoon.

When police got to the building - in the 200 block of East Palmyra Avenue in Orange - they found Solorio bleeding on the sidewalk.

'Jessica and Jennifer have been together 13 years and Jennifer  had a friend over for like, two days. [Jessica] thought that [Jennifer] was cheating on her,' neighbor Edgar Lopez tells CBS Los Angeles.

Other witnesses say there was a woman waiting for Solario in a car at the time of the shooting. As she tried to flee the building with a box of clothing, Gonzalez shot her four times before fleeing on foot.

Sonia Martinez, a friend of Gonzalez's, tells KTLA she spent Saturday with Gonzalez as she was on the run from police.

When asked why she was carrying a toy gun, Martinez said ' she wanted to go out like this.'

'She didn’t want to be a coward, and she didn’t want to take her own life,' Martinez said.
