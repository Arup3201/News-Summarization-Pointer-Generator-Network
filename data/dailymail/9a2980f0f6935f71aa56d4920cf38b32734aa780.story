Success: Sarah Millican has made more than £2 million in the past 12 months

She is a relative newcomer to our TV screens, but Sarah Millican is already earning as much as film stars and Premier League footballers.

The comedian, famous for her bright Geordie accent and garden fence philosophy, has made more than £2million in only 12 months.

She has bought herself a £1.3million mansion in the heart of the Manchester footballer belt, with five bedrooms, a library, conservatory and garages for four cars. She shares it with her boyfriend, comedian Gary Delaney, 40.

Nine years ago Newcastle-born Miss Millican, 37, was living with her parents after splitting up from her husband and was working at a Jobcentre in South Shields. She burst on to the comedy club circuit in 2008 and was given her own BBC series last year.

Accounts for her company, SM Comedy Limited, show she has assets of £2,524,350, up £2million on last year.

Miss Millican is so popular she already ranks as one of the most successful female comedians of all time .

She started to overhaul her life with the obligatory drastic hair cut and then joined a workshop for aspiring poets before finding her way on to the comedy circuit.

She went on the comedy circuit and gained a huge following after winning Best Newcomer at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2008.

The comedian has released two 
successful DVDs and making profits of more than £1.7million from The 
Sarah Millican Television Programme on BBC2.

Now
she rubs shoulders with Manchester United’s Rio Ferdinand and Wayne 
Rooney who live just a stone’s throw from her mansion in Mere, Cheshire.

Talking
about the split with her husband last year she said: ‘Can you imagine 
if he hadn’t left me? I’d still be in a job I hated, watching telly in a
damp flat. I had to go really low to come back up.’
