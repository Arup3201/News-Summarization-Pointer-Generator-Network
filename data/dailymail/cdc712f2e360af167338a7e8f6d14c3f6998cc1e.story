New allegations: The Met Police will reveal that Jimmy Savile abused the sick and dying at a UK hospice

Jimmy Savile targeted at least one UK hospice where he abused sick and dying patients, as well as the staff caring for them, an official report will reveal this week.

The Metropolitan Police will also name hospitals, prisons and schools across the UK where the paedophile DJ sexually assaulted and raped at least 200 people.

Although Savile's abuse at Stoke Mandeville, Broadmoor and Leeds General Infirmary hospitals have become well-known since his death, it is thought he may have attacked people in at least seven other places.

Some of these institutions allowed him to wander around freely, handed him sets of keys to visit out of hours and even gave him his own room with a bed to sleep in.

But his attacks in the unnamed hospice were unknown until now.

Mark Williams-Thomas, the former policeman whose ITV documentary exposed Savile, said: 'There seems to be nowhere Savile went 
where he did not abuse people.'

The name and location of the hospice will be revealed in the Met's first report into his crimes, written by officers working on Operation Yewtree.

Scotland Yard told MailOnline today they would not comment on the latest allegations but confirmed their report would be released imminently.

The Met say a total of 31 allegations of rape have been made against Savile so far.

And 589 people have come forward with information relating to the scandal, with a total of 450 complaints against the BBC presenter and DJ himself, mainly alleging sexual abuse.

Meanwhile, DJ Dave Lee Travis has been bailed again by police investigating the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal and other unconnected allegations.

The former Radio One presenter denied groping two women in BBC studios when he was held in November and said that in the past, tactile behaviour was regarded as 'giving somebody a cuddle'.

Travis, 67, has taken great pains to distance himself from Savile and stressed the allegations against him have 'nothing to do with kids' and are not linked to the disgraced TV presenter.

He spoke out in the wake of his 
arrest to say he had been accused of 'squeezing the boobs of a couple of
women' - something he vigorously denied.

The DJ - known as DLT - was held at 7.45am on November 15 and later released on bail.

He is alleged to have put his hand up one woman's skirt and 'jiggled' the breasts of another.

The Magic AM presenter was taken off air by the radio station's owners when the claims emerged.

He was granted bail for a second time today and ordered to return to a police station on an unspecified date in March, Scotland Yard said.

Ten weeks after the launch of Operation Yewtree, police recorded 199 crimes in 17 force areas in which Savile is a suspect, with 31 allegations of rape.

Others who have been arrested include former pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, publicist Max Clifford and Jim Davidson. Those four are on police bail. They have denied the allegations.

Ten men in total have been arrested by Yewtree officers.

Today Esther Rantzen launched a blistering attack on the Jimmy Savile police inquiry team over its concentration on arresting celebrities.

The ChildLine founder claimed Scotland Yard’s high-profile Operation Yewtree’s focus on the famous could even jeopardise the chances of young abuse victims seeing justice.

She said the £2million investigation was in danger of trivialising and sensationalising child abuse.
