The wife of a man featured in a hit YouTube video in which a sleeping stranger snuggles up to him on the tube, hit the roof because she thought he was having an affair.

Rakesh Nair, from Croydon, was travelling on London Underground's Jubilee line late at night when the dozing woman leaned over and began cuddling his arm.

The video, which was filmed by a fellow passenger, quickly became an online sensation and has been viewed by over 500,000 people after it was uploaded to YouTube.

Strangers on a train: Rakesh Nair, right, was forced to explain to his wife after his fellow passenger leaned over and began cuddling his arm on the London underground

Going: As the train lurches forward the woman sits up for a brief second...

Gone: The woman suddenly flings her arms around Rakesh, who had been quietly reading the paper

But when wife Latha viewed it she thought Rakesh was having an affair and demanded an explanation.

Rakesh, head chef at an Indian 
Restaurant in Westminster,Â  was forced to reassure her that he had never
met the woman before in his life and that it was her snuggling up to him and not vice versa.

He told the Croydon Advertiser: 'I got into trouble with my wife who thought it must be something quite serious.

'She didn't think it was funny to 
begin with. She thought it was a work colleague or someone I knew and 
started accusing me of these things.

'I said 'I didn't know the woman'. She was convinced, eventually, and saw the funny side. All is well.

'Most people getting home at that time have been working and are obviously very tired, they don't quite know what's happening.'

You're not who I thought you were! Snapping awake, the girl inspects who exactly she fell asleep on

Mortified: The passenger hides her face in her hands, humiliated at her over-friendly cuddle

He doesn't seem to mind: Both find the funny side of the unexpected cuddle, but it landed Rakesh in hot water after the clip went viral on the internet

The video appears to show the woman, 
named on YouTube as Paula Jovel, unable to open her eyes any longer, she
dozes off in her seat and sways slightly.

In
the video the carriage jerks and she sits up, looks at the man next to 
her for a couple of seconds then flings her arms around the man.

She then opens her eyes, looks at the camera and laughs when she 'realises' she's been caught on film.
