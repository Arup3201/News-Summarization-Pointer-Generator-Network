The judge will be dead angry! Lindsay Lohan fails to show up for morgue duty on first day of community service

It will be interesting to see if this excuse washes with the judge.

Lindsay Lohan turned up 40 minutes 
late for her first day of community service yesterday at the LA County 
Morgue - only to be turned away without credit.

The 25-year-old actress was supposed to report at 8am on Thursday morning - but arrived at 8.40am, rolling up in an $80,000 Porsche.

Her
 publicist claims she was late 'due to a combination of not knowing the 
entrance to go through and confusion caused by the media waiting for her
 arrival'.

Lohan has also taken to Twitter, saying: 'With all of the stress and pressure 
from yesterday and today, I've never been so happy to go to therapy!!! 

'Also, I'm sorry for the confusion that I may of (sic) caused to those at
 the Coroner's office. Won't happen again, now I know where to go!'

Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter, 
however, is unconvinced by Lohan's excuse, telling reporters that she 
has been to the morgue before so should have known where to go.

Speaking later in the day, Winter told RadarOnline that Lindsay will not be allowed to turn up unannounced on Friday at the morgue because she will need to ask for permission first from her probation department and possibly Judge Stephanie Sautner.

'Ms. Lohan has to have permission from the probation department and/or the judge, that she can come back,' he told RadarOnline.

'I haven't heard from the probation department or the judge about whether or not Ms. Lohan will be allowed to come back.'

Following today's incident, Lindsay went to see her therapist in Beverly Hills. 

'With all of the stress and pressure from yesterday and today, I've never been so happy to go to therapy!!!!' she tweeted later in the morning.

Lohan will face the wrath of Judge Sautner on her next court appearance on November 2.

Where's Lindsay? Camera crews wait for Lohan's arrival at the morgue yesterday when she arrived late

Clean-up duty: Lohan has been ordered to complete 16 hours at the morgue before her next court hearing on November 2

The actress was ordered to undertake 16 hours of morgue duty before her November court hearing at Wednesday's appearance.

So long as she manages to complete these hours in the next two weeks she is not in violation of her probation.

However, the Coroner's Office will 
notify the Probation's Voluteer Center - which monitors Lindsay's 
probation - of yesterday's drama before the judge is formally told.

Lohan is already skating on thin ice 
with Sautner, who blasted the Mean Girls star on Wednesday for not making 
an effort to complete her probation.

Long arm of the law: Lindsay seen here arriving for her court hearing on Wednesday

Finding her feet: Lindsay tweet from yesterday apologising for the confusion at the morgue and suggesting she had got lost

The judge is incensed the actress has
 barely scratched the surface of the 480 hours of community service she 
was ordered to complete as part of her sentence for the theft of a gold 
necklace earlier this year.

Lohan only did around a 
day-and-a-half at the Downtown Women's Centre in LA - and failed to show
 up nine times, resulting in her being rejected from the programme.

This week she did some volunteer work
 for the Red Cross - but Sautner ruled it as void because it was not 
part of the sentence she had specifically stipulated at an earlier 
hearing.

Sautner said only time completed at the women's centre and the morgue counted.

What a twit: She also tweeted that she was pleased to be going to therapy after a stressful day yesterday and in court on Wednesday

Rejected: Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter tells reporters Lohan arrived late for her court-ordered community service and was sent away

In a further development, LA County 
Sherif Lee Baca has told Fox 11's Good Day LA that the overcrowding 
issue will not keep Lohan out of jail.

He told the show that if Lindsay is 
sentenced to jail time he will make sure he finds room for her, adding 
she needs at least 60 days inside to be rehabilitated.

The news comes after Lohan's father Michael spoke out, claiming his daughter was back on drugs and needs help.

He said the recent photos of her 
discoloured and apparently rotting teeth was down to her smoking 
methamphetamine or crack cocaine. 

Lohan posted $100,000 bail yesterday following her court hearing.

Lead away in cuffs: Lindsay was taken into custody after being blasted by the judge. She later posted $100,000 bail

Laying the lawn down: Judge Stephanie Saunter pulled not punches during yesterday's hearing

Kicked off: Lindsay missed nine scheduled times 
to work at The Downtown Women's Center and told the Probation Office it 
did not 'fulfil' her
