A teacher on board the Virgin Atlantic flight forced to make a U-turn by an 'out of control' passenger has spoken of the terror at 35,000ft.

Vicky Keen, from Bristol, who was flying to London Heathrow from Hong Kong on flight VS201, described a man 'roaming around the plane, shouting, ranting and being very aggressive towards the crew'.

The man - identified only as a 26-year-old called 'Robert' - had to be restrained with straps by crew after 'losing control and failing to follow instructions from staff'.

'Terrifying': Vicky Keen, pictured with her husband Joel, was on board the London-bound Virgin Atlantic flight forced to return to Hong Kong

The flight had been in the air for just over an hour-and-a-half when the incident occurred.

Expat Mrs Keen, 31, who moved to Hong Kong with her husband Joel, was flying to the UK to see family and friends.

She told the Bristol Post: 'It was a very frightening experience. I was travelling alone ... so it really shook me up.

'There was quite severe turbulence and everyone had to be seated, but he carried on causing disruption so the crew had to intervene and restrain him with straps.'

Mrs Keen 
said the plane had to circle Hong Kong for some time before landing. She
 added: 'Lots of people on board were hysterical by this stage, 
especially the ones with children.'

Flight VS201, an Airbus A340 destined for London's Heathrow, was forced to turn back to Hong Kong International Airport after the 26-year-old man, identified only as 'Robert', became disruptive (file picture)

When the Virgin Atlantic flight landed, police boarded the plane and escorted the passenger off.

Mrs
 Keen, who teaches at an international school said she was forced to 
cancel her trip home as there wasn't another flight available until the 
following day.

Once the plane returned to the airport, the man was arrested and sent to hospital, authorities said.

'The foreign man called Robert, who is 26 years old, lost control on board and didn't follow instructions from staff on the flight,' a police spokesman told AFP.

'He was shouting... When the flight returned to Hong Kong, the man was arrested for violating aviation security ordinance and was sent to Princess Margaret Hospital,' he added. 

A Hong Kong airport authority spokeswoman said the plane, an Airbus A340, had departed at midnight.

A flight radar map shows the plane's flight path (in dark blue) and how it made a U-turn just 90 minutes after departing Hong Kong International Airport at midnight. The 'disruptive' man was arrested once it re-landed  

One
 passenger, who claimed to be on board the disrupted flight, said the 
man had to be restrained with belts during the incident.

Katie
 Wong wrote on Facebook: 'He just gone out of control (sic). Talk loud 
and walking ard. Actually he touched my shouter (sic) and go intimidated
 at the aisle when the captain announced we're diverting the flight.

'The crew ended up put him down temporarily with an injection (we guess) and tied him up with belts.'

Virgin Atlantic confirmed the flight had to turn back to Hong Kong after about 90 minutes, but was unable to confirm whether flight attendants had to restrain the man.

A spokesman said: 'Virgin Atlantic can confirm that due to a disruptive passenger flight VS201 to London Heathrow returned to Hong Kong and was met by authorities on arrival.

'Virgin Atlantic does not tolerate disruptive behaviour by passengers on-board and the safety and welfare of our passengers and crew is the airline's top priority.'

Katie Wong, believed to be a passenger on Flight VS201, said the man was 'out of control' and had to be tied up with belts by the crew in the process of being restrained. He was later taken to hospital after being arrested

Passengers left stranded by the incident were put up in hotels in Hong Kong and were due to flight out last night.

'The rest of the passengers were provided with accommodation before they depart tonight,' a Hong Kong-based Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said.

Police said this morning that the man had not yet been charged.

Authorities were unable to confirm whether he was still in hospital and what treatment he had received.
