Trying to stop women having easier access to the morning-after is ‘medieval’, sexist and patronising, Nick Clegg has claimed.

New guidance from the watchdog National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) suggests young women - including under-16s - should be allowed to stock up on emergency contraception.

Opponents claim the move will encourage women to be more promiscuous, but Mr Clegg said he was appalled and ‘really very angry’ about the outdated attitude towards women.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured icing cakes today, condemned opponents of a plan to allow women to stockpile the morning after pill

The changes mean women will be able to obtain the morning-after pill for free from GPs and family planning clinics to keep it at home or in their handbags.

Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, claimed it risked ‘encouraging them to take a more casual attitude to sex and exposing them to increased risk of sexually transmitted infections and emotional harm’.

But Mr Clegg hit back at the critics, insisting women should be given the freedom to choose what they do, and the priority was to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, the Deputy Prime Minister told LBC 97.3: ‘I am absolutely appalled and really very angry on behalf of many, many women across the country about the suggestion that giving a woman the right to buy a morning-after pill will somehow automatically lead to more promiscuous behaviour.

Worry: Plans to let teenagers stock up on the morning-after pill will encourage reckless sexual behaviour, experts have warned

‘I think it is demeaning, I think it is patronising, I think it is sexist.’

Women do not take the morning-after pill lightly or casually, Mr Clegg said.

‘To say to a woman she can't have the right, in case she has unprotected sex, to have a morning-after pill available because we - the Government, society or whichever newspaper columnist is pontificating about this - think she will suddenly become terribly promiscuous, I think is an absolute insult to women across the country.

‘I believe the experts, who have quite clearly said that providing the morning-after pill and other forms of contraception - the evidence is very clear - doesn't lead to more promiscuous behaviour. It does help prevent unwanted pregnancies.’

He said the row lifted the lid on a really fundamental difference in attitudes towards women.

‘Women shouldn't be told: “We are not going to give you the freedom to buy something from a chemist because we don't trust how you will behave sexually”.

‘It's a Victorian - worse than that, medieval - approach to women.’

His comments may put him at odds with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is reported to have opposed the plans.

Mr Clegg said he had not discussed his views on the issue with Mr Hunt, and insisted doctors should urge girls aged 16 or under who are seeking contraception to talk to their parents about it.

Mr Clegg tried his hand at icing a cake with Emma Pickup in Betty's Team Room, Harrogate, during a regional tour were he attended the launch of the Tour de France festival

But he added: ‘At the end of the day, when you are faced with the reality of a teenager who is in trouble, you as a medical expert want to help them, and I think for us to decree that they can or can't help someone isn't going to alter the fact that that 16-year-old is in trouble.

‘I don't want to see teenagers - or anybody, it at all possible - suffering an unwanted pregnancy. I don't want to see the very high rates we have had in the past of unwanted pregnancies.

‘The way to deal with that is to make sure we go with the evidence that if you provide people with education and information and make contraception available on a responsible basis, that is the way we stop unwanted pregnancies, not by resorting to really out-dated attitudes towards women.’
