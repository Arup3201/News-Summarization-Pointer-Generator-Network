A murderer has posted  photographs on Facebook of a superhero-themed birthday cake which was smuggled into his cell, bragging: ‘Who said prison was hard.’ 

Liam Whitnell, who is serving a life sentence for stabbing a 24-year-old man in front of his family, also uploaded images of a takeaway kebab and a ginger beer alongside what appears to be blocks of cannabis.

And in a flagrant breach of prison rules, the brutal killer has been pictured chatting on a mobile phone inside his cell – which boasts a games console, an expensive-looking music system and a cupboard full of DVDs.

Whitnell also posted a photo of a birthday cake in pictures which have angered his victim's family

The photographs, which outraged the 
family of Whitnell’s victim, were posted online to celebrate his 31st 
birthday. He claimed the cake was a present from fellow inmates, 
writing: ‘B.day cake from da boys.’ He also revealed that he was having a
 ‘good time’. 

Whitnell, of Stepney, east London, was jailed for a minimum of 24 years in 2013.

Along
 with three other accomplices he had attacked Kowshar Hussain with 
knives and a wheel brace in 2011 – in what a judge described as the 
killing of a ‘totally innocent family man’. 

Last
 night Mr Hussain’s sister Amirun Nehar, 24, who was with her brother 
when he was murdered, said of Whitnell: ‘He is obviously not suffering 
at all. 

‘Everything seems 
to be good for him, he still gets to see his family when they come to 
visit him, he gets cake and kebabs for his birthday, he still gets to 
enjoy himself. Why should he get all that when he killed my brother?’ 

She added: ‘He took something from us that we will never get back.

'My
 dad can’t believe that my brother’s birthday is coming up and we can’t 
do anything about it but his killer is here celebrating his birthday. 
He’s got it so easy. This can’t be justice. We have been failed.’

And she told the Mail that her brother was a loving ‘family man’ who she believed died trying to protect her and his wife.

She went on to say: ‘He loved kids, he had just got married and he was looking forward to having kids of his own. 

‘All his nephews and nieces adored him. He was a proper family guy.’

Whitnell was jailed for life after he was convicted of the murder of Kowshar Hussain in East London in 2011

Mr
 Hussain, who had been married for only 18 months at the time of his 
murder, was stabbed to death as he retrieved a baby seat from a car. 

He was collecting the seat for his brother-in-law who had been involved in a scuffle with the men and was afraid of reprisals.

Officers at HMP Wandsworth, Britain’s biggest jail, have now launched an investigation into the Facebook page and pictures.

Mobiles
 are banned in prison. The Prison Service also has an agreement with 
Facebook to close down accounts being updated by or on behalf of serving
 prisoners.

It is 
understood that four inmates at the 163-year-old category B prison – 
including Whitnell – have been moved to the segregation unit for 
accessing social media.

A 
prison spokesman said: ‘No prisoner should be in any doubt that if they 
break the rules they will be stripped of their privileges and could face
 further disciplinary action. These claims are now being investigated as
 a matter of urgency.’ 

But
 yesterday a relative of Mr Hussain, who did not want to be named for 
fear of reprisals, said: ‘We don’t think this is justice, how can they 
be allowed to get away with this? It makes a joke of the system.’

They
 went on to say: ‘These men have done some really bad things, they 
should be in a category A prison being properly punished and not sitting
 around playing PlayStation.’
