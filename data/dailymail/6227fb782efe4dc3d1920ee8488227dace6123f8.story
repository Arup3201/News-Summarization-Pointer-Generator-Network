Inside the draw hall in Monaco on Thursday afternoon, it will be the turn of the greatest names in the Champions League to enter the competition for real.

Toni Kroos, James Rodriguez, Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thiago Motta are among the star turns who will be hunched around television sets at training grounds all over Europe.

At London Colney, the man who engineered Arsenal’s squeaky qualifying win at the Emirates over Besiktas, will be itching for the chance to compete with the best midfielders in Europe.

Time to shine: Jack Wilshere dazzled at times against Besiktas, but must do more this season

This, as Arsene Wenger accurately described at the start of the season, is the biggest of Jack Wilshere’s career. It feels like now or never.

It was only a year or so ago that former England captain Steven Gerrard guaranteed increased scrutiny on the midfielder by elevating him into the world class category.

At lunchtime today he will be named, alongside young Calum Chambers and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, in Roy Hodgson’s first England squad since they exited the World Cup with only a point.

Without Gerrard and Frank Lampard, who confirmed his international retirement on Tuesday, Wilshere will have the chance to make hay in the centre of England’ s midfield.

At 22 there is time to blossom, but club and country need him.

So much was, rightly, made of the poolside party pictures from Las Vegas just days after England’s embarrassing exit from the World Cup with a single point.

On Wednesday night, without the presence and influence of the suspended Aaron Ramsey in the centre, there was something of a swagger about Wilshere’s game.

It wasn’t vintage, far from it, but he was instrumental in the goal that took Arsenal into the group stage after their annual dice with death in the qualifiers.

At times he came alive, switching player with a swivel of his hips or a dip of his shoulder.

There was the extravagant turn in the second half, spinning off Veli Kavlak and Ramon Motta before driving forward at the start of another attack that lifted Arsenal’s fans.

‘The burst is back when he get away from players,’ admitted Wenger and it would be hard to disagree. When he does that, he can compete with anyone.

His quick-witted one-two with Mesut Ozil for Arsenal’s goal, the one that guarantees a 17th successive year of Champions League football, drew gasps of admiration form the Emirates crowd.

Mostly they were for Alexis Sanchez after he scored his first goal in an Arsenal shirt, but Wilshere played a significant role in it.

There are times, especially when Aaron Ramsey is missing from the team through suspension, that the stage is set for Wilshere to dazzle.

God-willing, Wilshere will go on to fulfil his potential. No-one doubts that he has the touches to be one of the main thrusts in this Arsenal team when they have the ball.

When they are without it, his game suffers. He knows that he brought down Besiktas winger Ramon Motta inside the area before Arsenal’s opening goal.

It should have been a penalty, fairly straightforward for referee Pedro Proenca really, but somehow he ignored the claims from Besiktas’ players.

‘I probably touched him, but it was a slip,’ admitted Wilshere. On Wednesday night, the Arsenal midfielder landed on his feet.
