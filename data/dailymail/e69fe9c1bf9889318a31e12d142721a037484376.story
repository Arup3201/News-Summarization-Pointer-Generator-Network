Arrested: Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz has been charged with accepting paid travel, the services of prostitutes and Lady Gaga concert tickets in a devastating bribery case for the US Navy

A U.S. Navy commander has been accused of moving ships 'like chess pieces' to ports in Asia to financially benefit a defense contractor, in return for prostitutes and Lady Gaga tickets, according to naval court documents.

Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz also allegedly passed 
confidential information on ship routes to the firm, Singapore-based 
company, Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd, or GDMA.

The accusations unfolding in a federal 
court case signal serious national security breaches and corruption, 
with the threat that more people, including those of higher ranks, could
 be swept up as the investigation continues.

A hearing on November 8 
could set a trial date.

Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd is run by the gregarious Malaysian businessman nicknamed ‘Fat Leonard’, who is well known by U.S. Navy commanders in the Pacific.

But prosecutors in court papers say Leonard Francis worked his connections to obtain military secrets by arranging prostitutes, Lady Gaga tickets and other bribes for a U.S. commander, in a scandal reverberating across the Navy.

Misiewicz and Francis moved Navy vessels like chess pieces, diverting aircraft carriers, destroyers and other ships to Asian ports with lax oversight where Francis could inflate costs, according to the criminal complaint.

The firm overcharged the Navy millions for fuel, food and other services it provided, and invented tariffs by using phony port authorities, the prosecution alleges.

At the time, Misiewicz was deputy 
operations officer for the U.S. commander of the Seventh Fleet, which 
oversees operations over some 48 million square miles extending from 
Japan to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and from Vladivostok, Russia, 
to Australia.

Prior to his assignment at the Seventh 
Fleet, Misiewicz had been commanding officer of the USS Mustin, a 
forward-deployed guided-missile destroyer.

‘It's pretty big when you have one person who can dictate where ships are going to go and being influenced by a contractor,’ said retired Rear Admiral Terry McKnight, who has no direct knowledge of the investigation. ‘A lot of people are saying, “How could this happen?’'

So far, authorities have arrested Misiewicz; Francis; his company's general manager of global government contracts, Alex Wisidagama; and a senior Navy investigator, John Beliveau II. Beliveau is accused of keeping Francis updated on the investigation and advising him on how to respond in exchange for luxury trips, prostitution services, and more.

All have pleaded not guilty. The 
defendants face up to five years in prison if convicted of conspiracy to
 commit bribery. Defense attorneys declined to comment.

Senior
 Navy officials said they believe that more people would likely be 
implicated in the scheme, but it's too early to tell how many or how 
high this will go in the naval ranks. Other unnamed Navy personnel are 
mentioned in court documents as getting gifts from Francis.

Francis
 is legendary in military circles in that part of the world, said 
McKnight, who does not know him personally. He is known for 
extravagance. His bungalow in an upscale Singapore neighborhood drew 
spectators since 2007 to its lavish, outdoor Christmas decorations, 
which The Straits Times newspaper described as rivaling the island 
city-state's main shopping street.

‘He's
 a larger-than-life figure,’ McKnight said. ‘You talk to any captain on 
any ship that has sailed in the Pacific and they will know exactly who 
he is.’

CBS News reported that maintenance for one ship, the aircraft carrier Stennis, cost the Navy $2.7 million, which is about double the average price charged by other ports.

Navy spokesman, 
Rear Admiral John Kirby said Navy Criminal Investigative Service agents 
initiated their probe in 2010, but declined to comment further, citing 
the ongoing investigation.

That
 same year, Misiewicz caught the world's attention when he made an 
emotional return as a U.S. Naval commander to his native Cambodia, where
 he had been rescued as a child from the violence of the Khmer Rouge and
 adopted by an American woman. His homecoming was widely covered by 
international media.

Meanwhile, Francis was recruiting him for his scheme, according to court documents.

Francis' company bilked the Navy out of $10 million in just one year in Thailand alone, U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said.

The federal government has suspended its contracts with Francis.

Francis was arrested in San Diegoin September, while Misiewicz was taken into custody in Colorado and 
Beliveau in Virginia - all in September.

Francis was allegedly arrested in the United States after
 being duped into coming to San Diego by Navy officials who arrested him
 in a sting-operation.

According to a 2010 U.S. Navy release, 
Misiewicz grew up near Phnom Penh during the Vietnam war and was adopted
 by an American woman shortly before the Khmer Rouge came to power in 
1975.

He escaped the notorious 'Killing 
Fields' and was heralded publicly for his successful rise to become the 
skipper of the USS Mustin - and made an emotional returen to Cambodia in
 2010, which was given huge media attention.

The
 Navy said in the release that a visit by the USS Mustin to 
Sihanoukville, Cambodia, in December 2010 marked his first return to 
that country since his adoption 37 years earlier.

Last month a senior Navy spokesman deflected inquires into the status of the still-unfolding investigation.

'We
 don't comment on ongoing investigations, except to say that we are 
committed to supporting the investigation,” the spokesman told Fox News.
 “We hold our leaders to -- and expect them to uphold -- high standards 
of conduct and professionalism.'
