Prince Harry, pictured last month, was so taken with the Maritime inn in Brixham, Devon that he offered to buy it for £650,000

Prince Harry was so taken with a Devon pub he visited during a stag weekend that he jokingly offered to pay the landlady £650,000 to buy the picturesque drinking hole.

The royal had journeyed to the seaside town of Brixham in Devon for one of his friend's stag dos, with the group popping into the Maritime Inn for a few drinks.

And Harry enjoyed his time in the pub, which overlooks Brixham Harbour, so much that he joked with landlady Pat Seddon that he would buy it from her.

Mrs Seddon, 75, said that when the Prince and his friends told her how much they 
liked her pub, which boasts a distinctive frontage featuring part of a 
mock up galleon above the ivy-clad porchway, she quipped he could snap it up it for £650,000.

She said: 'Somebody from his group called out, "what a lovely pub," so I said "you can have it if you want".

'Then Prince Harry said, "how much" and I jokingly said "six and a half hundred thousand" and he said, "oh I've got that in my pocket".

Mrs Seddon has been behind the bar of the the Maritime Inn for 33 years and became a 
minor celebrity herself when she featured in Fish Town, the Sky TV 
series about the port.

She said that Harry had visited the pub, which also features hundreds of decorative jugs hanging from the beams of the ceiling in is located in the town's aptly-named King Street, with a group of around 14 friends on Friday evening.

Mrs Seddon said that her royal visitor had been sporting a cap to cover his famous red hair, but she had immediately spotted who he was.

'It was lovely to see them,' she said.

'Prince Harry was wearing a cap and combat jacket. He was lovely.'

The group spent their night playing 
darts and drinking - and despite celebrating their friend's 'last 
weekend of freedom' had behaved impeccably.

'They were well behaved - they enjoyed themselves - they were drinking beer and spirits,' said Mrs Seddon.

'They stayed on one side of the bar - I made sure they weren't pestered.

'I didn't know they were turning up but I recognised Harry almost immediately. It was a surprise but if Prince Harry wants to come in my pub that's fine with me.

'It was a good evening - everyone seemed to have a good time.'

She added: 'They stayed all evening and they were very well-behaved. One or two of the locals recognised them, but they left them alone.

'The regulars and the bodyguards stayed on the other side of the bar and gave them some space.

'A big white taxi van arrived at the end of the evening to take them all home. They did tell me they were on a stag weekend and introduced the groom.'

On Sunday lunchtime, the Prince of Wales’ younger son was spotted sitting outside a nearby pub,  the Cricket Inn at Beesands - where locals said he was wearing a cap and glasses.
