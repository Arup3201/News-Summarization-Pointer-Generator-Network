Andy Murray was teased about proposing to his girlfriend Kim Sears when he held an impromptu question-and-answer session on Twitter

Wimbledon champion Andy Murray was teased about proposing to his girlfriend when he surprised fans with an impromptu question-and-answer session on Twitter.

The tennis star revealed his childhood crush was Halle Berry and joked the most boring thing about tennis was his own voice, during the two hour session.

He also said he did not think he would win the Sports Personality of the Year as he 'never thought id win anything with the word personality in it (sic)'.

Finding himself with down time in his preparation for the 2014 season on the ATP World Tour, the World No. 4 opened the floor to his almost 2.3 million followers on Twitter for a question-and-answer session with the hashtag #askandy.

The 26-year-old revealed everything from his favourite cereal - Frosted Mini-Wheats - to his favourite tennis player - Andre Agassi - during the session.

Murray showed his sense of humour throughout the session, during which he took a question from a fictional Twitter account written in the voice of the Wimbledon Roof.

Meanwhile, when former professional Darren Cahill asked Murray about a wedding date for him and girlfriend Kim Sears, the tennis star replied: 'Don't start!'

Last month, the Scottish Daily Mail reported how Murray revealed he was thinking of having children with his long-term partner.

He said: ‘I can see myself having a family one day. It is something that I’m starting to think about because Kim and I have been together for eight years.’

Murray was effusive about his girlfriend, who he first met at the US Open in 2005, in his book reflecting on his life and career so far, which was being serialised in The Times newspaper.

Writing in the book he said: ‘You’re in these huge cities meeting new people all the time and it would be easy to get your head turned.

‘But Kim’s always been there for me. 
She really cares about me and helps with so many things. She always has.
 That’s why we have such a great relationship.’

Murray makes his return to the ATP World Tour after a three-month layoff due to a back injury.

 won four titles in 2013, including a historic victory at Wimbledon. He
