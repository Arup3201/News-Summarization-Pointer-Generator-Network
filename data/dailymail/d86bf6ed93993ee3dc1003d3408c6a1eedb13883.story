Ann Coulter's contributions to world affairs often prove controversial, but this one really was.

The conservative pundit is facing a backlash and being lampooned on the internet after apparently trying to mock the 'Bring Back Our Girls' hashtag this week.

On Sunday, Coulter tweeted 'My hashtag contribution to world affairs' with an image of herself holding a sign with her own hashtag, #Bring Back Our Country.

It was a reference to the use of #BringBackOurGirls on Twitter to encourage the release of the teenage 
girls by the Islamist militant group, Boko Haram.

The suspected gunmen 
took 276 girls from their dormitories more than a month ago. Last week 
they captured an additional eight individuals.

Coulter's tweet in an apparent attempt to ridicule some of the high profile people, 
including First Lady Michelle Obama, who took part in the original 
campaign.

By Wednesday, the tweet had received more than 2,300 retweets.

Scores of celebrities got involved in the campaign, here was Khloe Kardashian's tweet

Support: Cara Delevingne holds up a sign with the hashtag #bringbackourgirls

But then supporters of the campaign began posting their responses, with some replacing the text on Coulterâ€™s piece of paper with their own phrases to describe their views of her public post.

One, Becky Carrizales, replaced the hashtag she held up with: 'I'm a miserable person who peddles hate to make money off dumb republicans.'

Another, Gregor Rossino, wrote: '#BRING BACK MY SOUL'

J.W. Basilo said: 'Exactly what is "our" country? I know you get paid to be a divisive troll but this is lowest denominator pandering even for you.'
