CM Punk has never competed in mixed martial arts and, at the age of 36, knows time is against him

'My professional wrestling days are over, it's awesome to be here,' said the 36-year-old. 'This is something I've wanted to do for a long time.

'I have a background in kempo and I’ve been doing Brazilian jiu-jitsu for a long time. This is my new career, 100 per cent. I'm going to go full steam ahead, all systems go after today, and it's going to be fun. 

'I have nothing but respect for everybody here at the UFC, everybody who steps in the Octagon to fight. And when it's all said and done, when I'm finished, everybody's going to have to respect me because I have come here to fight.

'I felt like it was now or never. I have a limited window most fighters don't have. I'm either here to win or get my ass kicked.'

He will make his debut next year.

UFC President Dana White told ESPN: 'He wanted to fight here. He wanted to give it a shot, so we gave him an opportunity. It's not like Brock Lesnar. We're not going to throw the kitchen sink at him. 

'Lesnar had a wrestling background. [CM Punk] is going to fight a guy who is 1-0, 1-1, 2-1, something like that.

'He's been coming to fights for a long time and after his WWE contract was up, he called me and said he wanted to give it a shot. I said, "All right. We'll give you a shot."'

There was a mixed reaction to the news with women's bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey tweeting: 'WHA?!?!?! @CMPunk!!?!!!!?!! #cantwait'.

But Nate Diaz responded simply: 'Why?'.

CM Punk follows in the footsteps of former WWE stars Lesnar, Dave Bautista and Bobby Lashley.
