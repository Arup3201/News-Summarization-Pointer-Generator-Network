A drug addict who beheaded a British grandmother in a frenzied knife attack on the holiday island of Tenerife has been sentenced to 20 years in a secure psychiatric unit.

Homeless Bulgarian Deyan Deyanov, 29, was convicted of murder by a jury of nine at the Provincial Court in Santa Cruz de Tenerife on Friday.

He repeatedly stabbed and beheaded Jennifer Mills-Westley, 60, while she was shopping in the popular resort of Los Cristianos in the Canary Islands, Spain, on May 13 2011.

In a written sentence, magistrate Maria Jesus Garcia Sanchez imposed the toughest tariff available for the schizophrenic, who the jury found had diminished responsibility for his crime.

She also ordered that Deyanov, who was living rough when he randomly murdered Ms Mills-Westley, should pay her daughters, Sarah and Samantha Mills-Westley, 100,000 euros.

During a four-day trial, Deyanov denied murder and said he did not recognise himself in CCTV footage of the attack shown to the jury.

He also claimed to hear voices which tell him he is an 'angel of Jesus Christ', sent to create a new Jerusalem.

Paranoid: Deyanov is a paranoid schizophrenic who said he was an angel of Jesus Christ

Devastated: Mrs Mills-Westley daughters arrive in court to hear the result of the case

In her written sentence Ms Garcia Sanchez said she took into account the 'criminal danger' Deyanov represented.

She said Ms Mills-Westley had no chance given the 'forceful and unexpected' nature of the attack she suffered.

'Frequently, homicidal intent is something which must be inferred,' she added.

'In this case, homicidal intent exists without a doubt and inferences are unnecessary.'

The paranoid schizophrenic had been allowed to leave a specialist unit in Wales seven months earlier.

The victim’s daughter Sarah, 43, read
a statement on behalf of her and sister Samantha, 39, outside the 
Spanish court, after he was found guilty which read: ‘It’s hard to put into words the devastating 
impact that this preventable and needless act has had on us as a family,
sadly Mum was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Footage: CCTV footage of the fatal attack on Ms Mills-Westley (right) 
was shown in court (left). After being shown the video Deyanov said it 
was 'a montage, a film' and claimed that he did not recognise himself

‘Lessons must be learnt from this 
tragic event to ensure justice is done for our mum and to ensure that no
other family has to be subjected to this ordeal.

'It is clear to us that
there has been a catalogue of failings.

‘We will be asking the Welsh health authority to carry out a full inquiry.’

Drug-user Deyanov was sectioned under
the Mental Health Act and admitted to Glan Clwyd Hospital’s Ablett 
Psychiatric Unit in North Wales in summer 2010.

But he left the unit in October that year and moved to Tenerife, where his drug use and mental health problems worsened.

There was a warrant out for his arrest three days before the murder but police failed to locate him.

Asked if there was anything he wanted to say after the verdict was read out, Deyanov then declared to a hushed courtroom: 'I am the second reincarnation of Jesus Christ and I 
will bring the fire of the Holy Spirit to bear against this court.'

Business as usual: The shop where Mrs Mills-Westley was attacked was trading again less than 24 hours after the killing

Amateur footage: After watching the CCTV footage, Deyanov 
said it was 'a montage, a film' and claimed that he did not recognise 
himself in the images

Tackled to the ground: He also denied that he 
had lived in Wales, where he was sectioned in the summer of 2010 under 
the Mental Health Act at Glan Clwyd Hospital

He carried out the attack  in
the popular resort of Los Cristianos on May 13, 2011 in a shopping 
centre that was already bustling with tourists of all nationalities.

The mother of two who split her time 
between homes in Tenerife and Norwich, Norfolk, was picked at random 
after voices in Deyanov's head ordered him to kill, the court heard.

But despite his schizophrenia, the jury
found that Deyanov was guilty of murder under Spanish law because he 
took his victim by surprise and she could not defend herself.

Wearing
an olive green hoodie, black tracksuit trousers and running shoes, 
Deyanov remained quiet and still as the verdict was read out.

The
victim's daughters Samantha, 39, and Sarah, 43, have attended the 
entire trial of their mother's killer since it began.

They 
were accompanied by Sarah’s partner Brian Moore, 41, the victim’s 
brother John Smith, 63, and sister-in-law, Julie Smith, 62.

Reading the statement outside court, 
Sarah Mills-Westley, who lives in the Midi-Pyrenees region of France 
said: 'Despite our expectations, we have been disappointed by the lack 
of any other support - notably the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and 
our mum's MP in her hometown of Norwich.

'Whilst today closes one chapter, we will have to live with the painful consequences for the rest of our lives.

'We ask that we are now granted privacy after an extremely difficult and emotional week.'

Asked if the family would talk to 
authorities in the UK to find out why Deyanov was released from hospital
in Wales, she said: 'We will be asking the Welsh Health Authority to 
conduct a full inquiry into what happened in particular around his 
treatment in the UK.'

The defendant said he had been using crack cocaine and LSD before his arrest, but had no memory of living in Tenerife

Drug-addled drifter: Deyanov was a drifter who 
had lived in Tenerife and Wales where in 2010 he was sectioned under the
mental health act

Ms Mills-Westley said the care of people like Deyanov should be taken more seriously.

She said: 'Since the May 13 2011, Jennifer Mills-Westley has become known as the lady who was beheaded in Tenerife.

'The truth is she was our mum, our mentor and our best friend.

'She was a highly gifted, selfless person with so much love in her heart and who has been taken away from us in her prime.

'It’s
hard to put into words the devastating impact that this preventable and
needless act has had on us as a family - sadly mum was in the wrong 
place at the wrong time.'

Deyanov, who earlier claimed in court to be 'an angel of Jesus Christ', had denied murder, claiming security camera 
footage of him carrying out the gruesome murder was 'a montage'.

Answering questions in Bulgarian with
the help of an interpreter, Deyanov also told the court he is haunted by 
voices which tell him how to act.

He claimed they were telling him he was 'an angel of Jesus Christ who is going to create a new Jerusalem', adding: 'They direct how I act, sometimes they say kill, fight, hit, pray.'

Prosecutor Angel Garcia Rodriguez asked for the maximum sentence of 20 years in a secure psychiatric ward to be imposed.

Defence lawyer Francisco Beltran said
the former timeshare dealer should get the minimum sentence of 15 
years, saying Deyanov was 'a sick man who requires help'.

He
has blamed Spanish authorities for the murder, telling the court: 'He 
might as well have been carrying a sign saying "I'm a bomb and I could 
explode at any moment",' defence lawyer Francisco Beltran said.

'Responsibility must fall to some extent with the health authorities in the Canary Islands,' he added.

'My client is a sick man, not a criminal, and he should have been diagnosed and treated.

'Why was he not diagnosed and treated properly? He was suffering from acute paranoid schizophrenia. Why was he released?'
