Fearing a possible repeat of the 2011 riot and an attack on staff from detainees, security teams from the Department of Immigration and Australian Customs swooped on Villawood Detention Centre, with teams of sniffer dogs, uncovering a cache of potential weapons, drugs, syringes and smart phones.

Daily Mail Australia has been provided with first look at the items found during the operation, which sources say was sparked by concerns from security teams inside the facility, who'd recently witnessed suspicious activity within the grounds and feared an attack against guards was imminent.

Department officials suggest the swoop was 'a routine search' but the raids on Monday uncovered several bags full of contraband from inside the facility, teams tipped off by security personnel which units to search. In one unit complex alone, there were four phones, concealed shears and half a dozen syringes.

The raids uncovered sharp utensils, wrapped up and hidden inside laundry powder tubs as well as more than a dozen mobile phones. These are contraband items found inside one of the unit complexes

Behind the barbed wire fences at Villawood Detention Centre, security officials had recently become concerned by suspicious activities by some detainees

There hasn't been a major disturbance inside the centre for almost four years, when several asylum seekers sparked a full-scale riot and the complex was set alight.

More than 500 people are housed inside Villawood at any given time.

During the search, officers found garden shears wrapped up and concealed inside laundry powder tubs.

Seized items also included drugs and drug paraphernalia, such as pipes and syringes.

Officials also uncovered up to a dozen smart phones, which are prohibited and are still investigating how they were smuggled in.

Deputy Secretary, Immigration Status Resolution Group, Cindy Briscoe said the Department is determined to stamp out the presence of illegal items inside detention centres.

'The Australian community has an expectation that we continue to maintain the safety and security of our detention centres,' Ms Brisco said.

'This safety extends to detainees, staff and visitors to the centre.'

'We have a zero tolerance approach to criminal behaviour or the possession of contraband.'

Officials said the operation highlighted the clear benefits of working as one organisation as they moved toward full integration of Immigration and Customs on July 1.

'I commend the Department and the Service for working together in such a well-organised and collegiate way on this search. It highlights the success we can achieve as one organisation,' Ms Briscoe said.

'As well as searches conducted by our officers, we also employed the use of detector dogs to detect and locate prohibited items, which proved a highly effective tool for this environment.'

As yet, there is no word as to action to be taken against the perpetrators. 

The last major security scare at Villawood was in 2011 when five asylum seekers sparked a riot inside the facility, setting it alight. Two people were arrested last year during a protest outside the walls, over the proposed transfer of detainees to WA.
