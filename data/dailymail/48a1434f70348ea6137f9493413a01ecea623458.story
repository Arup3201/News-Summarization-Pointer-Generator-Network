A Thalidomide victim who is blind in one eye, partially deaf and can barely walk is being stripped of welfare payments - because officials say she is not 'disabled' enough to be out of work.

Martine White, 50, was left severely disabled after her mother took the anti-sickness drug while pregnant with her during the 1960s.

She can barely dress herself or even brush her hair, uses a wheelchair and will undergo spinal surgery later this year.

Disabilities: Thalidomide victim Martine White of Burnley, Lancashire is blind in one eye, partially deaf and can barely walk. She has had benefits taken away because welfare officials say she is fit enough to work

Mrs White and her late husband Michael (pictured on their wedding day, right) were believed to be the first Thalidomide victims in Britain to get married. She now needs a carer to help her carry out simple tasks

But despite her disabilities the 
Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) has written to Mrs White saying 
she will lose her her £110 a week Employment and Support Allowance as 
she cannot prove she is unfit to work.

The former care assistant from 
Burnley, Lancashire, has now been served with court papers and must 
attend a tribunal where she will have to prove her disabilities to a 
judge.

In a report a DWP 
inspector said: 'She is not entitled to the support component on the 
grounds that she does not have limited capability for work related 
activity.'

Today Mrs White,
 a widow who pays the mortgage on her adapted house herself plus council
 tax,  said: 'Visually you only need to take one look at me to know 
there is no chance I can possibly go to work.

'If I was to get a job I would need my 
carer to go with me full time. I need to be aided even to go to the 
toilet and I don't think a prospective employer would even employ me 
knowing that I had to have a carer with me.

Happier times: Mrs White on her Wedding day with her late husband Michael in 1980. As well as her other disabilities, she has also undergone brain surgery and will undergo spinal surgery later this year

Help: She needs a special lift to get up and down the stairs of her property because of her disabilities

'I have been having a lot of 
accidents lately and I keep falling over because I am unstable on my 
feet and go dizzy quickly,' she said. 'I wouldn't be fit or safe to work. I have to 
have someone to get me up in the morning and help get me dressed.'

Mrs White, who needs a wheelchair to 
get around, has to use a stair lift, while her carer helps her make tea 
and brushes her hair.

'Because
 of my Thalidomide, like so many others, I have arthritis,' she said. 'It is 
because of the way I have had to manipulate my body over the years in 
order to try and live a normal life.'

'What
 anyone else finds a normal chore has killed us because we have had to 
use our bodies in a different way. I'm sure the judge will take one look
 at me and say 'why are you here?''

Fears: Mrs White with her son Carl, one of her four children. She says she does not want to rely on her family for help

Mrs White was one of 10,000 children 
born with disfigurements after the thalidomide anti-sickness drug was 
given to pregnant women in the 1950s and 1960s.

She married her late husband Michael 
who was also a Thalidomide victim in 1981 - the first Thalidomide couple
 to be married in Britain. In 2004 she underwent surgery to remove a 
brain tumour and retired from her job as a result.

She now requires a carer seven days a 
week, needs a lift to help her up the stairs and is permanently on 
medication to help relieve  constant pain. Trouble with her benefits
 began last year after Mrs White received a letter notifying her of a 
changeover from incapacity benefits to Employment and Support Allowance.

Just a few weeks later, in July, she 
received another letter saying she was no longer entitled to benefits 
and she must go on a work training course. The family appealed and the 
decision was overturned.

But last October she was re-contacted
 by the DWP and told once again she should not be claiming benefits. A 
further appeal was rejected, although she can still continue claiming £154 a week
 in Disability Living Allowance.

Mrs White, who has four children and 
five grandchildren, added: 'I can't sit for a long time because it is 
uncomfortable. I am blind in one eye, I have an artificial hip and I am 
waiting for spinal surgery. I am unsteady with my balance and I am deaf 
in both ears and need hearing aids.

'It
 is like no one has looked at these medical reports from my past - I 
even have a full adapted automatic car which you can only get on 
mobility. I have no teeth either because I have had to open things 
with my teeth.

'I have
 also got arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis - you name it. As a 
Thalidomide [victim] we have to use our bodies in a different way and this has
 set in.'

Mrs White said she cannot sit for a
 long period of time so would be no good in the office and cannot hear properly so a job in 
telecommunications would be 'out of the question.'

Mrs White said was 'disgusted' by the DWP's decision and labelled its officers 'jobsworths.'

'If the 
support is taken away from my full-time carers I would have to rely on 
family,' she said. 'I have three boys and a girl. I can't ask the boys to help me 
shower - it is undignified,' she said.

Fighting the decision: A letter from HM Courts & Tribunals Service confirming Mrs White's appeal

Her son Carl White, a joiner, 32, said: 'This country has too much red tape and not enough common sense. The DWP are just idiots - I just can't 
understand what they are doing. It's an insult.'

A DWP spokesman said: 'The old incapacity benefits system condemned too 
many people to a life on benefits with little hope of moving back to 
work. Now people who can work will be given help to find a job while those who need unconditional support will get it.

'A decision on whether someone is well enough to work is taken after 
consideration of all the supporting medical evidence provided by the 
claimant, but everybody has the right to appeal a decision if they 
disagree with it.'

The Government's crackdown on disability benefits will accelerate in April, when Disability Living Allowance will gradually be 
replaced by the Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which is being 
introduced in an attempt to cut the nation’s benefits bill.

To get the PIP, people must have a face-to-face assessment, rather than simply filling out a form. In the past decade, the number of people receiving DLA has soared by more than a third, from 2.4million to 3.3million.

The cost to the taxpayer is now £13billion a year. An astonishing seven out of ten claimants – 71 per cent – have been offered the benefit for life without any checks to see if they still need it, according to the Department for Work and Pensions.
