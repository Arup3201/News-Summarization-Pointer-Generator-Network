Women in their 50s are having fertility treatment paid for by the NHS.

The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said up to 12 such women were granted IVF funding over a three-year period.

Campaigners said that public money should instead go on telling women how hard it was to get pregnant in their 50s.

Josephine Quintavalle, of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: ‘We’d be better spending money educating women about the reality of reproduction. Fertility starts to dip mid-thirties and by 50 it’s at the menopausal stage.

‘No matter how hard we try to keep eternally young we know that ageing takes place and it impacts significantly on reproduction at a much earlier stage than most women realise.

‘Whether it’s on the NHS or privately, doctors must be very honest with women and not raise false hopes. There was probably lots of heartache, it is highly unlikely a woman will get pregnant after 50.’

Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, said: ‘While we can sympathise with those women who have reached the end of their natural childbearing years without having the children they longed for, the use of medical technology to overcome the natural order raises serious ethical questions.

‘The NHS should recognise that there are good reasons why the years of female fertility are limited and not fund treatment that seeks to artificially prolong them.

‘All too often, children are being regarded as consumer goods to be fitted in when they are most convenient to the lifestyle choices of their mothers, rather than as human beings to be loved and treasured in their own right.’

Under NHS guidelines, women can be offered IVF only up to the age of 42 and in many areas it is heavily rationed. Only one in five local clinical commissioning groups offers the recommended three courses of treatment. Many offer only one or refuse to fund it once women turn 35.

Experts said it was probable women undergoing IVF in their 50s would use younger, donor eggs as their own would be of too poor quality to be fertilised. This adds £6,000 to the £3,000 standard treatment cost.

The fertilisation authority would not say exactly how many women in their 50s had their doctor’s consent for IVF but admitted it was two to four each year in 2010, 2011 and 2012. This means that up to 12 women in their 50s over that period were given IVF treatment.

Josephine Quintavalle, of Comment on Reproductive Ethics said it was highly unlikely a woman will get pregnant after 50 while experts warned that even successful pregnancies carried higher risks at that age

Philippa Taylor, of the Christian Medical Fellowship, which represents 4,000 Christian doctors, said: ‘This raises the issue about success rates, which are less than 1.9 per cent, the NHS’s funding and the effect on the woman’s health and her baby. The risks to the mother are increased the older she gets.

‘IVF is not the panacea it’s often made out to be. I have sympathy for any woman desperate to have a child – but they should not delay childhood and assume IVF is an insurance policy that can be taken out at any age.’

The authority’s figures also show that soaring numbers of women in their 40s and 50s are opting for IVF.

Totals for NHS and private sector treatment show that around 170 women a week in their 40s had IVF in 2012. The annual total was 8,808 – nearly 1,300 higher than in 2008.

The number of women in their 40s paying for private IVF treatment went up by 25 per cent between 2008 and 2012.

Studies have suggested that women who conceive in their 50s are at a far higher risk of suffering from high blood pressure and potentially dangerous blood clots.

Children born to much older mothers are also more likely to be born prematurely or to have Down’s syndrome. The risk of stillbirth is also higher.

A poll of 2,000 people last year showed that almost three quarters do not believe older women should be given IVF to help them conceive.

It also found that one in three thought the suggested limit of 42 for IVF on the NHS was too high.

And two in three said children born to women aged between 50 and 55 were negatively affected by having an older mother.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘IVF treatment is a clinical decision, taking consideration of NICE guidelines.’
