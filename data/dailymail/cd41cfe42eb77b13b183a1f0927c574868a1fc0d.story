A holidaymaker alerted police from 5,000 miles away after watching burglars ransacking his home via security cameras he had linked up to his iPad.

The unnamed home owner was enjoying a sunshine break in Mauritius when he noticed the burglary taking place at his house in Australia.

He immediately alerted his local police who rushed round to his home and arrested two men at the scene.

The victim said he had been horrified to catch the burglars red-handed as he relaxed on the paradise Indian Ocean island.

He said: 'I was shocked. I was watching them for a good two minutes before I called the cops. I didn't know what to do.'

The suspected thieves made two visits to the victim's home in Melbourne after realising he had left the property unattended.

They allegedly stole thousands of pounds of electrical equipment including a flat-screen television as well as alcohol, shoes and even the family's dog bed.

But they were unaware that every move they made was being recorded by webcams and streamed live to the internet.

And they were busted when the homeowner decided to log on to check his property and spotted them raiding his cupboards.

The man said he bought the webcams three years ago for just AUS$55 each. He added: 'But I never thought they would come to be used one day.'

Two men, aged 32 and 55, were arrested at the scene of the raid, which happened two months ago.

The Herald Sun reported that both had been charged with burglary and theft and are due to appear in court next month.

Police spokeswoman Bianca Aitken, one of three officers who rushed to the house, said she had been amazed to receive a tip-off from such a distance.

She added: 'You obviously have CCTV footage, which helps, but to actually get them on an iPad from the other side of the world is a pretty good find, I think.

'I guess he was being cautious with going overseas, but it paid off.'

The island nation of Mauritius is a popular tourist destination which offers pristine beaches and calm turquoise waters.

It lies in the Indian Ocean, around 5,200 miles north west of Melbourne.
