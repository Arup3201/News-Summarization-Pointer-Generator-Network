Four women who were raped by a high-powered Seattle attorney have sued both him and his wife.

Danford
 Grant admitted to raping five women and is currently locked up at a 
Shelton state prison where he is serving a 25-year jail sentence and is 
expected to spend most of the rest of his life.

The four women who were masseuses says they suffered physical and emotional injuries at Grant’s hands.

The victims wrote letters that were read at his sentencing in May detailing how Grant's crimes had devastated their lives.

Indefensible: Danford Grant pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced to 25 years on Monday May 19

Co-accomplice? Grant's wife, Jennifer may have tampered with evidence in the rape case against her husband, Danford. She is also being sued in the lawsuit launched by the four raped women

The 
emotional statements prompted Judge William Downing to say of the 
victims, 'Their strength is as formidable as their innocence is 
unsullied.'

Grant
 plead guilty to the crimes. Had his case gone to trial, it was expected
 that his defense attorneys would have argued that he engaged in paid, 
consensual sex with the victims.

The ladies say it is the harm that Grant caused which gives them cause to make a legal claim.

The lawsuit also takes aim at Grants' wife Jennifer who was a 'co-conspirator' in the attacks.

Grant, a married father of three 
children, worked as an employment and business litigator and was a 
founding member of his own law firm.

He raped five women in a series of assaults in the summer and fall of 2012.

'Violent rapist': The sentence is exceptionally high. Grant now faces a lawsuit from four of the five women who were attacked

Scene of the crime: This is the Greenwood massage parlor room where Danford Grant raped a masseuse

Evidence: Grant was caught on camera thanks to a camera inside one of the massage parlor rooms where the rape took place

Grant was described by police as a serial rapist, 'obsessed with Asian women,' who preyed on immigrant masseuses.

Grant was 
arrested in September 2012 following a series of sexual assaults on 
massage therapists in Seattle, Shoreline and Bellevue in 2011 and 2012.

He
 targeted the minority women, knowing they would have difficulty 
reporting the crime because of language barriers and cultural attitudes 
surrounding sex.

Police
 were investigating reports of a client raping Asian masseuses in 
Seattle when Grant was apprehended by a bystander in Seattle as he 
attempted to flee a massage parlor in September 2012.

Investigators
 found that Grant's modus operandi was to go to Asian-run massage 
businesses after making an appointment under a fake name and using 
different phone numbers.

He
 would lull the masseuse into a false sense of security by acting 
politely and mentioning his position as an attorney or even lying that 
he was a police officer or doctor to bolster his stature.

He would sometimes lie that his wife was dead and profess love for the masseuse before asking for sex.

Traumatic: Danford Grant stalked Asian masseuses online and then raped them violently during or after appointments he scheduled under false names

When the masseuse denied his request, he would violently attack her, often at knife-point, and try to rape her.

Investigators
 discovered he would research massage businesses online and find out 
personal information about the massage therapists.

None of the women came to his sentencing but them women have all stated how their lives have been destroyed.

'I really 
wanted to be present during the court proceedings, but I did not have 
the courage to see this person again. When I saw him on the news on May 
5th, my entire body trembled and I lost strength in all limbs,' wrote 
one.

She
 continued that she is now always scared, suffers panic attacks and 
becomes terrified if she sees a man on the street who resembles Grant.

'I
 will never forget about the humiliation, the dark shadow, and the 
trauma that this incident has brought upon me and I will be entangled in
 these feelings for the rest of my life,' she wrote.

One
 woman told her husband she had been attacked with a knife, not 
divulging that she had also been raped, so great was her shame and 
distress.

His plans: Grant used to tell the women he was a police office or some other high-powered job in order to make them fear him and the possibility of deportation

'It
 has been 22 long months since the incident happened to me... I now 
suspect every male customer... Any small sudden motion by them will 
trigger me to think they are getting up to attack me.

I'm particularly 
fearful of the ones who appear well-mannered and friendly because they 
would remind me of the bastard who tried to rape me,' she wrote.

In one 
instance, Grant followed a masseuse back to her car after receiving a 
massage and ordered her into the the vehicle before driving somewhere 
secluded and raping her in the back seat.

In
 another, he returned to a business where he had previously tried to 
rape a masseuse and forced his way in when he was denied entry before 
raping the masseuse.

One
 victim said that she had undertaken many months of study to become a 
massage therapist and was horrified when she discovered that Grant's 
attorneys intended to argue that the women prostituted themselves.

'I read articles in the news and some reader's comments that said these were 'just Asian prostitutes.'

Then the defense lawyer said this was consensual sex and prostitution. 
It made me sick to my stomach... [To become a professional therapist] I 
did everything that Washington state requires here. I spent a lot of 
time and I worked very hard to complete school... I am a good, moral 
woman and I strictly respect my career as a massage therapist and skin 
care professional,' she wrote.

The
 husband of one victim also wrote a statement, describing coming home to
 find his wife on the floor in the fetal position in the aftermath of 
the attack.

'Heroic': Letters from victims of the former Seattle lawyer Danford Grant are read aloud during his sentencing, prompting the judge to comment that 'Their strength is as formidable as their innocence is unsullied'

He was 
finally caught after raping a masseuse at knife-point at a Greenwood spa
 when the owner and others arrived as he was leaving.

A struggle ensued and police found him two blocks away from the parlor.

A
 victim wrote that she weeps in the middle of the night and cannot bring
 herself to use a small knife in the kitchen because it looks similar to
 the knife Grant threatened her with.

During
 one of the attacks, Grant’s car – a Honda Pilot – had been parked 
nearby when he was arrested but was later moved by his wife, a former 
prosecutor with the city of Seattle.

When police finally searched the SUV, detectives claim to have seized a replica pistol, a bag of Viagra and various electronics.

Jennifer
 Grant removed an office key card and her husband’s wedding ring from 
the SUV which he had left in the cars he went to rape a masseuse.

Investigators
 even found that Grant had searched the internet for 'rape scenes' and 
even visited a website documenting such ideas.

Lasting trauma: Grant targeted the women because he believed their language barrier and awe at his stature as well as shame and embarrassment would prevent them coming forward

Having initially denied the allegations, Grant ultimately admitted to raping the women.

At his sentencing, Grant himself read a long letter in which he detailed his past problems with addictions and 'commercial sex.'

'Although,
 the truth about what I did is dramatically different from what was 
alleged, I do not minimize my real wrongs and my apology for those 
particular wrongs is genuine and heartfelt,' he said.

He
 painted himself as a dutiful husband and father and said he came to 
commit his crimes because he suffered anxierty and depression and 
'commercial sex' was a way to escape his problems and 'distorted' his 
thinking.

Neither Grant nor his wife have yet responded to the lawsuit.
