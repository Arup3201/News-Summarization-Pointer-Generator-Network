A US Air Force veteran has broken down while describing his experience at being the latest victim of the dangerous 'swatting' trend, where hackers report a bogus emergency with the goal of mobilizing a SWAT team.

Joshua Peters, 27 - who returned from service in Kuwait on a medical evacuation - was playing browser games from his home in St Cloud, Minnesota, and live-streaming himself online, when 10 armed officers stormed the house.

The hoaxer had found Peters' address and called the local police, reporting that someone had 'shot their roommate and now they were pointing their gun at them', according to The Guardian. 

Police also heard two gunshots ring out before the call ended. 

Victimized: Joshua Peters, 27, a returned US Air Force officer, is the latest gamer to be targeted in the 'swatting' trend sweeping the streaming world, where hackers report a bogus emergency with the goal of mobilizing a SWAT team

Emotional: Peters was live streaming a game of RuneScape when he was swatted, with about 60,000 watching it unfold online. He later addressed the camera about what happened and broke down (pictured)

Peters said his siblings were home at the time and his 10-year-old brother answered the door.

He currently lives with his parents, and his mother was also home.

The team of police forced Peters face down to the floor.

By this time he had realized what was going on and tried to explain to police he had been streaming the popular games RuneScape and Clash of the Clans.

The cops assessed the house and realized Peters was telling the truth.

He returned to his computer about 15 minutes later.

The camera had been streaming the whole time, with about 60,000 watching the incident unfold.

An emotional Peters then addressed the situation, saying he had been swatted.

'I had police point a gun at my little brothers because of you,' Peters said through tears, with a video of the stream since uploaded to YouTube.

'They could have been shot, they could have died. 

'Because you chose to swat my stream. 

'I don’t give a s--- about what you have against me, or what I did to you. 

'For that I am at a loss for words. 

'Your gripe is with me. 

'But do not involve my family in this. 

'They don’t deserve it.'

Gamer: Peters was playing the popular browser games Clash of Clans and Runescape when the attack occurred, scaring his family

In an interview with The Guardian after the swatting incident, Peters said he believes the attack was random.

In other swatting attacks, gamers have been able to track down the addresses of people streaming using available information online, and then prank them.

'There’s no possible persons who I can think would do something like this to me,' he said.

'Before I knew it, my face was on a tile on the ground, hands wide open and a bunch of police officers with assault rifles.'

Peters added that he has witnessed other streamers being swatted.

St Cloud police are investigating what happened to Peters.

They hope to track down the person who staged the emergency call.

Sadly, swatting is not new to the gaming world.

The dangerous prank, where hackers report a bogus emergency with the goal of mobilizing a SWAT team, first surfaced around 2011, as streaming became increasingly popular.
