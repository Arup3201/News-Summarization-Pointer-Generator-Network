It's natural to assume that animals with large teeth and fearsome reputations such as the lion or shark are the world’s deadliest killers.

But appearances can be deceptive and if you judge a creature’s deadliness by the number of people it kills every year, the tiny mosquito comes out on top.

Malaria, which is among the diseases carried by mosquitoes, kills more than 600,000 people a year, while 200million people suffer from it on a daily basis - far more than unfortunate individuals that are bitten by crocodiles or wolves.

Malaria is spread by mosquitoes and occurs in around 100 countries.

It kills approximately 725,000 people every year and imposes a heavy social and economic burden in developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

It is estimated that 207million people suffered from the disease in 2012 and 90 per cent of deaths occurred in Africa - 77 per cent of which were among children who did not live to see their sixth birthday.

Mild cases of malaria cause flu-like symptoms, high fever and chills, which are particularly dangerous to pregnant women and children.

Severe malaria can cause lifelong intellectual disabilities and can result in death.Malaria's economic impact is estimated to cost billions of dollars in lost productivity each year.

In the last 12 years new cases of malaria have fallen by 25 per cent, and deaths by 42 per cent thanks to better diagnosis, pesticides and the use of bed nets.

It is the aim of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to eliminate the disease completely, but the malaria parasite has begun to develop resistance to insecticides and drugs currently used, making the fight extra hard.

Bill Gates shared an infographic on his blog to highlight the world’s 15 deadliest animals, based on the number of humans who die from coming into contact with them every year.

It reveals that the mosquito – Spanish for ‘little fly’ - kills more people than all the other animals listed put together.

‘Malaria threatens half of the world’s population and causes billions of dollars in lost productivity annually,’ Gates wrote on his blog.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has long been working on ways to eradicate malaria, as well as other mosquito-borne diseases, which include dengue fever, yellow fever, and encephalitis.

There are more than 2,500 species of mosquitos, found in over 100 countries and every region apart from Antarctica.

‘During the peak breeding seasons, they outnumber every other animal on Earth, except termites and ants,’ Gates wrote.

‘And
 they affect population patterns on a grand scale: In many malarial 
zones, the disease drives people inland and away from the coast, where 
the climate is more welcoming to mosquitoes.’

Sharks kill just 10 people a year, lions 100 and crocodiles 1,000, despite having among the most fearsome reputations - according to the infographic.

Humans wipe out 475,000 fellow people in murders and wars, but diseases such as schistosomiasis caused by freshwater snails, Chagas disease carried by bugs, sleeping sickness spread by Tsetse flies and rabies, which is transmitted by dogs, are also responsible for thousands of deaths.

The Nazis realised the deadliness of mosquitoes and were investigating how to use the bugs as biological weapons, recently discovered documents revealed.

SS-chief Heinrich Himmler’s entomological institute at Dachau concentration camp investigated whether malaria-infected mosquitoes could survive transport into enemy territory.

The institute, set up by Himmler in 1942, conducted trials of different types of mosquitoes to find which could be kept alive long enough to ‘transport’ malaria from the lab to Allied troops.

In 1944, a particular type of anopheles mosquito known for its capacity to transmit malaria to humans was recommended for use, according to an article in science journal Endeavour.

The project was ‘a bizarre mix of Himmler's smattering of scientific knowledge, personal paranoia, an esoteric world view, and genuine concerns about his SS troops’, the article’s author Klaus Reinhardt told Süddeutsche Zeitung.

Schistosomiasis, which is blamed for 10,000 deaths a year, is spread by tiny parasitic snails living in rivers and lakes in subtropical and tropical regions across the globe.

They burrow into human skin, moving closer to the abdomen to lay their eggs.

The disease, which can include paralysis of the legs and vomiting blood as well as flu-like symptoms, is caused by the immune system reacting to the eggs.

It is associated with poor living conditions, overcrowding, poor sanitation and a lack of clean water.

A total of 10,000 people are killed every year by Chagas disease, spread by the Assassin bug - also known as the kissing bug.

It is estimated that between seven and eight million people living in Central and South America have Chagas disease.

Its early symptoms include fever, swollen lymph nodes and headaches.

While up to 70 per cent of people do not show further symptoms, some individuals suffer an enlarged oesophagus or colon, and others have enlarged ventricles of the heart, which can result in heart failure.

Elsewhere, sleeping sickness kills an estimated 10,000 people a year.

In humans, bile injected by the Tsetse fly erupts into a red sore and within a few weeks, the person can experience fever, swollen lymph glands, aching muscles and joints, headaches and irritability.

As the disease takes hold, people can suffer changes in personality, confusion, slurred speech, seizures and difficulty in walking and talking.
