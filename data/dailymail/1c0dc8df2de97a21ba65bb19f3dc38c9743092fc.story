A 6-year-old boy has been safely returned to his family after he was mistakenly kidnapped by thieves who stole his mom's car in Clearwater, Florida, on Monday night.

Theron Fields was taken about 10:50 p.m. from the King James Apartments at 2035 Kings Highway.

The boy's mother had got out of the vehicle to go into their apartment and had left her son asleep in the backseat, police said.

When she returned to the car, it was gone, along with her son.

Fortunately police were quickly able to track down the missing vehicle - a rented white Ford Mustang convertible with a black top and a license plate number of 052 YSL.

Still sleeping in the back of the car was young Theron, who is described as a Hispanic boy standing about 4 feet tall and weighing 54 pounds.

Wearing jeans and an orange and gray shirt, Theron was blissfully unaware that he had momentarily been the victim of a kidnapping incident.
