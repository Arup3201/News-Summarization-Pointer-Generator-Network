Rupert Murdoch's most long-serving and trusted servant has followed in the footsteps of Rebekah Brooks and fallen on his sword.

Les Hinton, 67, who has worked for the tycoon for 52 years, has resigned from his post as chief executive of Dow Jones, which publishes the Wall Street Journal.

His loss will hit Murdoch hard and adds weight to claims from one of President Obama's closest allies last night that his U.S. empire is beginning to 'explode and unravel' in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.

Les Hinton has worked in Australia, the U.S. and the UK in various positions within Murdoch's organisation since starting out as reporter in Adelaide

The claim came as Murdoch's control over Fox and other cable channels appeared under increasing threat, with reports he could lose his television licences if found guilty of breaching anti-bribery laws

And Attorney General Eric Holder piled more pressure on the News Corporation chief, as he confirmed the Justice Department is considering opening a formal investigation into whether the company tried to hack into the voicemails of 9/11 victims.

Hinton was executive chairman of 
News International in London from 1995 to 2007, periods when the News of
the World was hacking phones.

Growing crisis: Rupert Murdoch's U.S. media empire is beginning to 'explode and unravel', according to think tank president John Podesta

He said he knew nothing about the scandalous behaviour by journalists which also cost News Corp chief executive Brooks her job but added that ‘the pain caused to innocent people is unimaginable’ and it was ‘proper’ for him to resign from News Corp.

Les Hinton was born in Bootle, on Merseyside but moved to Australia with his parents as a teenager. He joined the Adelaide News, which was then run by a young Rupert Murdoch in 1960. He followed him to The Sun six years later and then moved on to Americam, where he worked as a journalist for a number of the company's newspapers and magazines. He became a U.S. citizen after landing a senior job at Fox TV in 1986, but returned to Britain in 1995 to become chairman of News International. After Murdoch bought the Wall Street Journal, Mr Hinton transferred across the Atlantic again in 2007 to become the paper's chief executive and publisher.

'That I was ignorant of what apparently happened is irrelevant and in the circumstances I feel it is proper for me to resign.' 

He continued: 'When I left News International in December 2007, I believed that the rotten element at the News of the World had been eliminated, that important lessons had been learned and that journalistic integrity was restored.

'There had never been any evidence delivered to me that suggested the conduct had spread beyond one journalist. If others had evidence that wrongdoing went further, I was not told about it.' 

Murdoch said in a statement that he had accepted Mr Hinton's resignation with much sadness at losing his right-hand man after a remarkable journey.

'That this passage has come to an unexpected end, professionally, not personally, is a matter of much sadness to me,' he said. 

'I vividly recall an enthusiastic young man in the offices of my first newspaper in Adelaide, where Les joined the company as a 15-year-old and had the rather unenviable task of buying me sandwiches for lunch.' 

Mr Murdoch added that 'News Corporation is not Rupert Murdoch. It is the collective creativity and effort of many thousands of people around the world, and few individuals have given more to this company than Les Hinton.'

Salt was rubbed into the wound by comments last night from John Podesta, president of the Centre for American Progress, a liberal think tank, and the man who helped Obama's transition to the White House in 2008.

He told the Globe and Mail: 'This is 
not one rogue editor. This is an empire that was built on a set of 
journalistic ethics that's beginning to explode and unravel.

'They
were routinely bribing public officials. We've called attention to the 
fact that this story is going to go on for a while, this is not a 
two-week story, I don't think.'

Probe: Attorney General Eric Holder is considering launching a formal investigation into claims News Corp, for which John Podesta, of the Centre for American Progress, predicts a dire future

He is one of a number of senior Democrats hoping Murdoch's U.S. empire will fall in the wake of the scandal.

The White House has long fought with Fox News, owned by News Corporation, and boycotted the channel for a time.

Now there are increasing signs 
Murdoch could lose control of all his cable channels in America, which 
include National Geographic and FX as well as Fox.

Under federal law, holders of television and radio stations
licences have to undergo character tests to show they are fit and 
proper to be media owners.

Murdoch seems unlikely to pass those tests if Wall
Street’s fierce regulator, The Securities and Exchange Commission, seeks to enforce the part of the foreign bribery law that requires 
companies to keep accurate books, according to the Los Angeles Times.

If
it is proven that a company violates this and U.S anti-bribery 
provisions, there is a penalty of up to $2m, and if convicted, employees 
could face up to five years in prison.

Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, reportedly said this week the allegations should be investigated, but did not say whether his organisation would launch such a probe.

Yesterday Mr Holder confirmed the 
Department of Justice is responding to calls from lawmakers to 
investigate claims News Corporation hacked into the phones of 9/11 
victims.

At a press conference in Sydney, he 
said: 'There have been serious allegations raised in that regard in 
Great Britain; there is an ongoing investigation.

'There have been members of Congress in the United States who have asked us to investigate those same allegations. And we are progressing in the regard using the appropriate federal agencies in the United States.'

He also confirmed reports yesterday that the FBI has launched its own informal probe into the allegations.

It comes as senior Democrats questioned whether Murdoch's American papers, such as the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal, may also have engaged in telephone hacking.

The Democratic Senate Campaign Committee has already launched an online petition to demand the truth from Murdoch.

It reads: 'It's time for Rupert Murdoch to come clean and immediately tell the American people whether his company targeted any American's here at home. Sign our petition to demand the truth.'

By midday News Corporation shares were down 0.06 per cent as politicians and business experts rounded on Murdoch and the influence he has amassed over the media giant he founded.

Representative Peter King wrote: ‘If 
these allegations are proven true the conduct would merit felony charges
for attempting to violate various federal statues related to corruption
of public officials and prohibitions against wiretapping.

‘Any person found guilty of this purported conduct should receive the harshest sanctions available under law.’ 

Jeopardised: Any convictions against News Corporation could make obtaining television licenses for broadcasting programmes difficult

Some in the business world think Murdoch’s days are numbered at the helm of News Corporation.

Porter Bibb, managing partner at Mediatech Capital Partners, was reported as saying: ‘It is very likely, there will be at some point... an entire new management. 

‘It’s a fine company, it has great assets and a terrific future but Murdoch’s influence despite his de facto ownership is going to being diminished.’

Allyson Stewart-Allen, a director at International Marketing Partners, was reported as saying: ‘I think investors in America are needing to know if there is a capable leader, and some question now about whether James Murdoch is that capable a leader to run that enterprise.

‘The other question is the reassurance that advertisers aren’t going to flee the newspapers titles. In the worst case scenario should they flee then they need to kill the brands in the way the News of the World was anaesthetised or euthanised.’

Senator John McCain has criticised the decision for News Corp to be investigated in the U.S, telling Sky News it's a 'British issue that needs to be resolved first'.

But Media consultant Robert Dilenschneider told Fox the scandal is being over-hyped and Mr Murdoch has 'done all the right things'.
