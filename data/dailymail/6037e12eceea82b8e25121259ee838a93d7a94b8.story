Sam Allardyce says Andy Carroll has returned to London in a 'miserable' state with the West Ham striker facing a battle to play again this year.

The club's £15million record signing suffered ligament damage in his ankle in New Zealand last month and underwent surgery in America.

Carroll is now back in the UK but will be sidelined until December and, given his history of injuries, the Hammers will be cautious with his fitness, meaning a New Year return is likely.

And Allardyce admits there is a long road ahead for the 25-year-old who missed the bulk of last season with an achilles problem.

'He is pretty miserable,' said the West Ham boss, who signed £12million Enner Valencia as a replacement.

'He is not very happy with life at the moment because it is a massive blow to him again. We just have to pick his spirits up.

'Hopefully when the boot comes off and the specialist gives him the okay to start working again he will feel a lot happier with himself.

'But he is certainly very upset and very miserable at this moment in time.'

Meanwhile, defender James Collins has expressed his sympathy for his stricken team-mate.

'It is devastating for him,' he said. 'I had a similar situation last year and it is tough for him. Injuries happen and he has had two bad ones early in his career.

'He is a good character and has got good people around him. I am sure he will be back as quick as he can.'

Attention now turns to Ecuador international Valencia, although he is set to miss the start of the season as he continues to build fitness.

And Collins added: 'He has got goals in him which is what we need and what we are working on. Hopefully he can fit straight in and score some goals.'
