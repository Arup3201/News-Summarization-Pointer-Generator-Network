Paris St-Germain were made to pay for their profligacy as a late goal from Samuel Umtiti gave Lyon a 1-1 draw at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.

PSG had led through Edinson Cavani's 20th-minute header but, after wasting a whole host of chances to double their lead, Les Parisiens were stunned when Umtiti equalised with a deflected shot in the 84th minute after a rare Lyon foray forward.

Boos echoed around the Parc des Princes at the final whistle as Laurent Blanc's side's indifferent start to the season continues.

Last season's Ligue 1 winners are currently fifth with just two wins in their opening six matches.

Earlier, substitute Nabil Dirar's first-half goal gave Monaco a 1-0 victory over Guingamp at the Stade Louis II.

The Morocco winger, on for the injured Anthony Martial, struck seven minutes before half-time to give Leonardo Jardim's side only their second league victory of the new campaign - their first in three league matches.

The slender victory saw Monaco move up four places to 15th in the standings, while Guingamp replaced them in 19th.

Fabien Lemoine's 81st-minute goal earned St Etienne a 1-0 win at Lens while Lille and Montpellier shared a goalless draw at the Stade Pierre Mauroy.
