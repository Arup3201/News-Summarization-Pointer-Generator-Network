Lagerfeld, pictured last week at his studio in Paris, won't design condoms

Designing for Chanel might be his day job, but that doesn't mean Karl Lagerfeld won't throw his weight behind other brands.

Diet Coke, H&M clothing, Magnum ice cream, Shu Uemura, Melissa designer jelly shoes, a watch collection, a diet book and even a helicopter have all been given the Lagerfeld seal of approval.

But it seems there are still some things he considers too outlandish - among them condoms, toilet paper and support stockings.

The revelations came during an interview with French magazine Madame Le Figaro, which asked
him whether there was anything he wouldn’t put his name to.

In response, the 
designer said: 'Toilet paper? Support stockings? Condoms?'

But perhaps realising how many products bear his brand already, Lagerfeld began to backtrack, adding: 'But maybe… You know, I am mainstream.'

He also told the magazine of the things that make him lose his cool, saying: 'Things that are not happening as I wish [make me angry]. The things that take time.

'And people who say they are bored, even though I don't spend time with these kinds of people.

'I think that it's a crime to say you are bored when time is so precious and there are so many things to do in life: read, learn, watch.'

Boy band JLS made headlines in 2010 when they partnered up with Durex to release a line of branded condoms.

Aston Merrygold, Marvin Humes, Oritsé Williams and JB Gill posed for photographs as they released the range, called Just Love Safe, which they hoped would encourage people to have safe sex.

The four different packs of extra safe condoms featured each band member's favourite colour and were branded with the boys' faces.

Marvin said of the range: 'We came up
with the idea of Just Love Safe as we wanted to send a clear message 
out to fans that are over 16 and sexually active - and that is to always
use a condom during sex... it's important to put your love in a glove.'

Though unfortunately the world will have to wait for Karl Lagerfeld condoms for a little while longer yet.
