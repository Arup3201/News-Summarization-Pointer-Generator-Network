Parents who want their children to go to one of the best state schools in England can face a bill of up to £500,000 to buy a home in the right area, a report reveals today.

It shows how homes close to top secondary schools can be considerably more expensive than homes in other areas of the same county.

The most extreme example is Beaconsfield High School in Buckinghamshire where the average house price is £797,000, compared to an average price of £314,000 in the rest of the county.

This leaves a ‘school premium’ of £483,031, the largest one in England.

The report, from the banking giant Lloyds, said the average premium is £21,000 to live close to a top school.

Another example is Bishop Vesey’s Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield. A home typically costs around £299,000, compared to £167,000 in the West Midlands.

Researchers looked at the top 30 secondary state schools in England as well as the top ten performing secondary state schools in each region, based on last year’s [2013] GCSE data.

Competition for property around the highest-rated schools is most intense in the south-east, with house prices close to the top 10 state schools in the region being sold 27 per cent - or £72,314 - above the average house price in their county.

Nearly all the top 30 state schools have selective entry requirements, typically taking in the top 25 per cent of children academically.

But the research also found that it is possible to find good state schools in areas where house prices are not sky high.

Heckmondwike grammar, in West Yorkshire, has results that place it among the top 30 state schools in the country, but house prices nearby average just £99,000.

Barnet in north London also stands out as an area with some of the best state schools. But house prices are lower in the are than the average for the capital.

Marc Page, mortgages director at Lloyds Bank, said: ‘Although property values can be significantly lower in neighbouring areas, many parents don’t appear to be put off from paying a premium to ensure their child has the best possible chance to attend their chosen school.’

Many secondary schools have an ‘over-subscription’ criteria which means that those living closest to the school door will get priority if the number of successful applications exceeds the number of available places.
