Residents in one section of Los Angeles got a very big, and a little bit scary, surprise early Christmas morning.

A palm tree in a Mid-City area burst into flames, sending sparks and embers flying down the street as a result of the unusually high winds the region has been experiencing of recent.

And the entire thing was caught on camera by a freelance news cameraman.

A palm tree suddenly caught fire early Christmas morning in Los Angeles

The blaze sent embers and leaves flying down the street because of the unusually high winds in the area

Firefighters arrived on the scene soon after the blaze began and had the fire out in 20 minutes 

The fire began when the strong winds caused the tree to come in contact with a nearby power line, which immediately set the leaves on fire. 

Firefighters soon arrived ion the scene as small embers and a few large palms flew down the street will still on fire.

It took them 20 minutes to put out the blaze, and luckily no one was injured.

The fi9re started when the winds caused the tree to hot a power line

No one ended up hurt from the flying embers or burning plams 

The wind caused other problems across the region as well, with KTLA reporting that 12,000 people were without power early Thursday morning. 

Here's hoping Santa Claus was still able to get presents to those homes.
