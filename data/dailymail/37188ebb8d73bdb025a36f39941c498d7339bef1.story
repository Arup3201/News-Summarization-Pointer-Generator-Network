A Chicago-based entreprenuer has come up with something worth getting egg-cited about after inventing a gadget that scrambles an egg inside its own shell. 

The £10 ($17) contraption gently spins the egg, blending the yolk and the white without cracking the shell itself. 

The already-scrambled egg can then be soft or hard boiled - and its creator, Geraint Krumpe, claims the ingenious method makes them taste far better than regular eggs.

The device, which features a capsule for the egg suspended between two cords, was inspired by a Victorian era child's toy. 

Pulling the two cords apart causes the capsule to gently spin, mixing the egg's contents without damaging the fragile shell. 

Mr Krumpe is currently seeking funding for the product, named Goose, on crowdsourcing website Kickstarter and if successful plans to launch the product later this year.

Cracking invention:  Geraint Krumpe, a 37-year-old industrial designer, said the idea for the Goose gadget came about after he found a video online in which a guy claims to make an in-shell scrambled egg with a tea towel

The gadget works by alternating the rotation of an egg back and forth.Pulling the two cords apart causes the capsule to gently spin, mixing the egg's contents without damaging the fragile shell. 

Because the egg is scrambled inside the shell there, air doesn’t get into the egg.  ‘The result is a much creamier, custardy tasting egg which is far superior to normal scrambled eggs,’ said Mr Krumpe.  

Mr Krumpe, 37, who is an industrial designer, said: ‘The idea for the Goose all started when I found a video online in which a guy claimed to make an in-shell scrambled egg with a tea towel. 

‘I didn't believe it could be done so I decided I had to give it a go. I quickly used up all the eggs in my fridge and not one attempt was successful. 

‘Something sparked inside me and I became obsessed with trying to find an easy way of scrambling an egg in its shell every time. 

‘I remembered seeing a Victorian child's game that involves pulling two cords apart to spin a disc and thought I could apply the same principals in my design.

Sunny side up: ‘‘In the culinary world people are always looking to create different flavour profiles using the chemistry of cooking and this is exactly what the Goose does’, said Chicago-based  inventor Geraint Krumpe

‘I worked on the Goose for one year before I finally got the finished product. The result is a gadget that can fit any egg in and is guaranteed not to break the shell.

‘The Goose is all about injecting a little bit of fun back into the kitchen.’

It makes eggs taste more creamy as it prevents air getting inside the yolk
