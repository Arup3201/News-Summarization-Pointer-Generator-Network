A woman who called the NHS 111 helpline died while waiting for a doctor to ring her back.

The service is supposed to cater for ‘urgent healthcare needs’, but when the 33-year-old felt unwell and dialled the number, she was simply told to wait for a return call. By the time it came, it appears she was already dead.

The woman contacted the phone line for
 people in need of ‘fast medical help’, on December 22 after feeling 
unwell and was told to wait for a doctor.

By the time she was called back - 
around two hours later - she did not answer and an ambulance was sent to
 her home, but it was too late.

Now
 NHS managers have told Harmoni, the private company operating the 111 
call centre, to carry out an inquiry to see if the tragedy in Croydon, 
south London, could have been prevented.

Board papers presented to the Croydon Clinical Commissioning Group said the woman's condition had deteriorated rapidly in the two-hour gap.

The
 111 helpline was roundly criticised after it was launched last year, 
with some claiming they had to wait 11 hours for a call back.

The
 Croydon Clinical Commissioning Group, the NHS body which pays Harmoni 
to run the helpline for the area, admitted this week: ‘A serious 
incident occurred where … the patient’s condition deteriorated prior to 
the GP returning the call within the two-hour timeframe.’

The controversial helpline was launched in April 2013 to replace a previous non-emergency service and enable people to contact a doctor without the need to going to overcrowded A&E units.

Staff shortages have made the NHS 111 helpline unsafe at weekends, say its own managers.

Some call centres have no nurses at all overnight, leaving unqualified workers to make snap decisions about the critically ill.

An undercover investigation also found patients can wait hours to speak to a nurse.

Dr
 David Lee of Harmoni said: ‘Early findings suggest that this was a 
complex case assessed through NHS 111, including input from a clinician,
 and that there was unexpected and rapid deterioration in the patient.’

He also told local paper the Croydon Advertiser: 'We would like to offer our sincerest condolences to the 
family for their tragic loss.

'We
 notified the CCG of the incident and, as is the case with any 
unexpected death, a multi-agency investigation was immediately 
launched.'

'Early findings 
suggest that this was a complex case assessed through NHS 111, including
 input from a clinician, and that there was an unexpected and rapid 
deterioration in the patient.

'However, while the investigation remains ongoing and until all the facts are known, we cannot comment further.'

Dr
 Agnelo Fernandes, assistant clinical chairman of Croydon CCG said: 'We 
are taking this matter seriously, and our sympathies are with their 
friends and family at what must be a very difficult time.

'A
 detailed investigation is already under way to find out what happened 
and we will be able to say more once that investigation has been 
completed.'
