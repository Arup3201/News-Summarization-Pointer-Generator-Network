He is the smiling chief executioner who dares to bare his face in grotesque videos of himself executing prisoners. 

Referred to as the 'Desert Lion' by his supporters, Shakir Wahiyib  is the public face of the army threatening to destroy Iraq and is the chief executioner of the ISIS terror group.

Unlike many other commanders in the Islamist militant organisation, he appears on camera without covering his face. 

Now it is claimed he revels in being a Jihadist poster boy - and has even attracted female admirers from across the Middle East.

Little is known about Wahiyib, however, his tribal surname – Fahdawi – suggests he is from the Anbar-based Albu Fahd tribe, known to US forces as one of the ‘sinister six’ that first allied with al-Qaeda after Saddam Hussein's fall.

Wahiyib, who is thought to be in his late-20s, first gained notoriety through a chilling video which surfaced on jihadist websites last summer, showing him and his gang executing three Syrian lorry drivers who had been driving through ISIS territory in Anbar.

But in other pictures he is seen accepting flowers from a child, gently holding a bird of prey, and staring contemplatively into the middle distance while brandishing a rocket-propelled grenade.

Wahiyib's men have made significant gains in northern Iraq and are now marching on the capital Baghdad.

According to the Telegraph, Armoured convoys containing U.S.-trained soldiers – who mysteriously melted away in earlier confrontations – stormed towards the town of Balad, some 50 miles outside of the capital Baghdad.

The soldiers told of a gruelling fight with  ‘crazy, ruthless’ militants who were determined to hold their recent gains even at the cost of their lives.

Over the past week ISIS made dramatic gains in the Sunni heartland north of Baghdad after overrunning Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul on Tuesday.

Soldiers and policemen melted away in the face of the lightning advance, and thousands have fled to the self-ruled Kurdish region in northern Iraq - prompting condemnation and threats of harsh punishment from senior politicians.

The collapse this week started at the top with the senior-most commanders abandoning their positions early on Tuesday morning as black-clad Isis fighters swept into the country's second city of Mosul.

After they seized Falluja and other areas of Anbar late last year, Iraqi medical sources say some 6,000 soldiers died there. Iraq-based foreign diplomats say 12,000 deserted their posts.

Mosul's defenders held up well for three days until late Monday evening, but over the next few hours the force imploded, with the senior commander for all of Nineveh province, Mahdi Garawi, fleeing.

The commander of Iraq's ground forces, General Ali Ghaidan, and the vice chief of army staff, Lieutenant General Abboud Qanbar, also abandoned their posts, according to an Iraqi official and a Western security expert.

A former U.S. official in Iraq said poor treatment of rank-and-file soldiers by their superiors contributed to mass desertions.

Wahiyib's group, Isis, is the centre of power is Raqqa, a city in northern Syria, which is being run under the regime's oppressive and violent code.

'These guys, these units are demoralized,' the former official said. 'They are underpaid and ripped off constantly by their commanding officers, who steal their allowances and use their commands as a way to build a personal nest egg.'

Apart from a few standout units, such as special forces who have borne the brunt of the fighting, 'it's a hollow army,' the former official said.

Colonel Yassin Dwaij, a senior police in Iraq's western Anbar province, where officials put a $50,000 bounty on his head, described him as 'dangerous and cunning.’

In February, the leader of al-Qaeda issued a statement dissociating itself from Isis, which it accused of 'forbidden bloodshed' directed at fellow fighters.

Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's chief, cut ties after Isis attempted to bolster its strength by merging with other rebels in Syria.

He said: 'We weren't informed about its creation, nor counselled. Nor are we satisfied with it: rather we ordered it to stop... Nor is al–Qaeda responsible for its actions and behaviour.'

The organisation is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has a U.S. bounty of $10million on his head, second only to al-Zawahiri.

The ISIS leader, who was born in 1971 in Baghdad, is touted as a battlefield commander and tactician.

Baghdadi, who has a degree in Islamic studies, apparently joined the insurgency that erupted in Iraq soon after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.

He was taken as a prisoner of the Americans in Camp Bucca between 2005 and 2007 - it was here that one of the only two photos know to be in existence was taken of him.

He is known as 'The Ghost' to members of the pro-Assad Lebanese Shi-ite militia Hizballah.

The secretive Baghdadi talks with a scarf covering his face even when dealing with close allies, according to militants who worked with him in Iraq.

He addresses his ISIS followers through audio recordings posted to the internet, rather than in public places.

ISIS crucified this man they accused of being a supporter of the Syrian regime

Military sources have reported his death on numerous occasions in the past years, but the fighter always seems to reappear. This has led to speculation that al-Baghdadi is in fact a name used jointly by several commanders.

Some estimates claim Isis group has in excess of 10,000 fighting men in its ranks. Many of its fighters are thought to be radicalised Western Muslims who have poured in from Europe and North American to join the fighting in Syria and elsewhere.

The group, which controls large areas of land in Syria, is thought to be pouring resources and money from those areas into its burgeoning Iraqi campaign, which has seen it tear through the northern regions on the country.

Its military progress, largely unhindered by Iraq's own security forces, have given it control over several highly valuable oil fields, which leaders will hope to exploit to strengthen their hand.

The situation has alarmed officials in Turkey, who called an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors after 80 of its citizens were taken hostage by Isis.

'Turkey briefed the other allies on the situation in (the Iraqi city of) Mosul and the hostage-taking of Turkish citizens, including the consul general,' a NATO official said.

He said the meeting was held for informational purposes and not under Article 4 of NATO's founding treaty, which permits a member of the 28-nation alliance to ask for consultations with other allies when it feels its security is threatened.

Turks seized included 48 from the consulate in Mosul - including the consul-general and three children. Separately, 28 truck drivers who were delivering diesel to a power plant were captured on Monday.

Meanwhile, Baghdad residents were stockpiling food, fuel and weaponry in anticipation of an attack on the capital in the coming days.

Despite his high profile, little is known about the background of Wahiyib, who is referred to as the 'Desert Lion' by his supporters

Prime Minister Maliki has previously encouraged ordinary Iraqis to take up arms against the advancing soldiers of Isis, especially in light of claims that members of the police and military are intentionally defecting.

Senior sources in the Iraqi government have said that they have a plan to take back Mosul, but were unclear on the details.

Isis is pushing to expand its territory, which currently straddles the border between Syria and Iraq, and includes land extremely close to the Turkish border.

The group's centre of power is Raqqa, a city in northern Syria, which is being run under the regime's oppressive and violent code.

Raqqa was heavily contested throughout the Syrian conflict, and was held by several rebel groups until Isis threw out all other contenders in 2013.

Recently Isis leaders imposed punitive rules on the city's Christian population, demanding that they pay a levy of gold for 'protection' else face being killed on the streets for their faith.

Horrifying images have also emerged from the cities of crucifixions being used to punish men who attacked Isis fighters.

Seven men were sentenced to death after a grenade was thrown at a soldier near a roundabout in Raqqa. The men, who were riding motorbikes, were then hunted down by Isis forces, according to a statement from the group. Two of the men were sentenced to die by crucifixion.

One of the two was wrapped in a banner, which said: 'This man fought against Muslims and threw  a grenade in this place.'
