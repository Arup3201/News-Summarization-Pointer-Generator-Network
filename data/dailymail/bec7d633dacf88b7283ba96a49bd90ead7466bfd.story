It was the boredom of marking exams that led him to write his acclaimed first novel The Hobbit.

And, a newly uncovered letter reveals, this wandering mind was a life-long affliction for Professor John Tolkien – and not one he was proud of.

In the letter, which goes up for auction at Bonhams on Wednesday, the academic, who held professorships in both Anglo-Saxon and English Language and Literature at Oxford University, laments his early days as an inattentive pupil.

He wrote: ‘I wish I could now tell some 
of [my teachers] (of long ago) how I remember them and things they said,
 though I was (only, as it appeared) looking out of the window or 
giggling at my neighbour.’

Artefact: A letter written by Lord of the Rings author JRR Tolkien deriding teaching has emerged for sale - telling a newly-qualified teacher it is 'exhausting and depressing'

Admission: Tolkien replied to a teacher from London who read her class The Hobbit to keep them calm

The half-typed, half-handwritten note – which is expected to fetch between £1,500 and £2,000 at auction – was a reply to Anne Mountfield, at newly qualified teacher at Eltham Green School in London, who had read The Hobbit to calm her usually restless class.

One of her pupils was so moved by the book they penned a note to the author which Mrs Mountfield dutifully forwarded on.

In his response, Professor Tolkien complimented the student, saying he received many such letters but ‘few as well penned as this’.

However, under the official typed reply, the academic handwrote an aside for Mrs Mountfield, where he expressed his dissatisfaction with their shared profession, describing teaching as ‘exhausting and depressing’ and complained that ‘one is seldom comforted by knowing when one has had some effect’.

Professor Tolkien, most famous for writing The Lord of the Rings trilogy, was marking undergraduate work when he allowed his mind to wander and scribbled on the back of one paper: ‘In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit’.

This nonsense sentence went on to become the first words of The Hobbit and launched one of the twentieth century’s most successful literary careers. Since first being published in 1937, the children’s novel has sold more than 100 million copies.

After receiving the letter, Mrs Mountfield filed it away and promptly forgot all about it before rediscovering it last year.

She had been sent a note from a former pupil thanking her for being such an influence on her early lives and then, just days later, she stumbled across Professor Tolkien’s note and his thoughts on teaching.

She put the coincidence down to ‘a little Gandalf magic’ and said: ‘How right Tolkien was that teachers are seldom “comforted by knowing that one has had some effect” and how very nice when, 50 years after the event, it happens.’
