Russian police raided a play featuring the trial of the three members of punk collective Pussy Riot, in what a government critic said was part of an anti-Western campaign promoted by President Putin.

Moscow officers interrupted the performance  in central Moscow, and cautioned the Swiss director for violating visa rules, earlier today.

The play features the recent trials of three members of Pussy Riot for staging a profanity-laced protest in Moscow's main cathedral last February.

Accusations: Ex-deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov, pictured in 2010, claim the raid on the theatre was part of an anti-Western campaign promoted by Vladimir Putin

Former deputy prime minister and Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov, said the raid on the theatre was part of an anti-Western drive fostered by President Vladimir Putin.

‘Our leadership is suffering a grave form of spymania and the fight against the West has become a number one priority in its domestic and foreign policies,’ he said.

Federal Migration Service officers delayed the performance of ‘Moscow Trials’ at the capital's Sakharov centre for one hour as they issued a verbal warning to director Milo Rau, local news reported.

The trials and convictions of Maria Alekhina, Yekaterina Samutsevich and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova over their ‘punk-prayer’ in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior, became international news last year and the ‘Free Pussy Riot’ campaign gained support from high-profile celebrities such as Madonna, Sting and Paul McCartney.

Yekaterina Samutsevich was later released on appeal but both Ms Alekhina and Ms Tolokonnikova are serving sentences in Russian work camps for 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred'.

During heir trial, the trio said the protest was meant to draw attention to close ties between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Kremlin.

Russia's relations with the West have cooled since Putin returned to the presidency last May.

In January Russia banned adoptions of children by U.S. parents in response to U.S. legislation imposing visa and asset restrictions on Russians accused of violating human rights. Russia has also forced non-governmental organisations receiving overseas funding to register themselves as ‘foreign agents’.

The migration officials raiding ‘Moscow Trials’ were accompanied by Cossacks, a traditionalist group whose recent revival has been encouraged by Putin, according to Publicpost.ru and twitter reports from the scene.

No formal punishment was imposed on Rau for allegedy violating visa conditions, Interfax quoted Sergei Kalyuzhny, the Federal Migration Service's deputy head as saying.

‘He entered (Russia) on a business visa, which does not allow any working activity,’ Kaluzhny said.

Putin's return to the presidency last year was soured by the biggest political protest over the past decade, which analysts say led the Kremlin to ramp up nationalist rhetoric.
