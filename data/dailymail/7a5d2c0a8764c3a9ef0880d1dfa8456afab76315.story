A British couple who moved to India to open a hospital have been devastated by the kidnap and murder of their son, allegedly by one of their employees.

Ishan Rawal, eight, disappeared during the opening ceremony of his parent’s new clinic in Indore, Madhya Pradesh state.

Doctors Nikita and Arvind Rawal, from Beverly, East Yorkshire, discovered that their son was missing on the day their dream was set to come true.

Ishan's body was discovered in woodland a few miles away from the hospital after a man who works for the Rawals admitted to kidnapping and strangling the boy.

However
the Rawals, who previously worked at Hull Royal Infirmary and Castle 
Hill Hospital, believe there is more to their son’s death.

The family believe it may be the work of 
more than one killer, orchestrated by their enemies in an attempt to 
halt their work and force them to move back to Britain.

They are desperate to bring their son’s killer(s) to justice and are calling on the British Government for help.

Mrs
Rawal, 42, who moved to India with her husband and two sons Ishan and 
Rusheek a year ago, said: ‘How can someone do such a thing?

‘He was such a talented boy - he played tennis and was getting on very well at school.

‘We are missing a very big part of our lives that we will never get back.’

It was Ishan’s brother who discovered 
that the boy had gone missing during the inauguration ceremony at Royal 
Shanti Hospital in Indore, the capital of the central India state.

Mr Rawal, 43, said: ‘We spent an hour looking all over the hospital.

‘There were people everywhere so it was very hectic and when we couldn't find him, we reported it to the police.

‘We had our suspicions that he had been kidnapped.’

Shaan
Das, who worked as a servant at the Rawals’ house, had been seen 
driving from the ceremony with Ishan on his motorbike, but returned 
without him.

When Mr Rawal 
and police questioned Mr Das, he initially denied knowing where the boy 
was but then said he had ‘taken him for a bike ride and left him 
somewhere,’ Ishan’s mother Nikita said.

Das knew both boys well and had often helped them download games to play on their computer.

Mr Das, has admitted to killing Ishan 'because he was annoyed with the behaviour by Mr and Mrs Rawal,' the Daily Bhaskar reports.

The paper alleged that Mr Das was 'quite annoyed' when Mrs Rawal refused to give him job in the hospital.

However,
The Rawals refuse to believe their son was murdered over a job dispute 
and is setting up a campaign to bring the killer to justice.

Nikita said: ‘In March, it was decided he wouldn't work for the hospital.

‘But
he already had a job so he wasn't unemployed and it was months ago. 
We've requested an inquiry into what happened - it was so well planned, 
we know there is more to it.’

Mr Rawal says the Indian police are 
satisfied with the arrest of Das as the prime suspect and are not 
concerned about looking for anyone else in connection with Ishan's 
murder.

The family have now invited the British High Commission to meet authorities in Delhi in an attempt to widen the murder investigation.

He said: ‘We'd like our friends in East Yorkshire to help us and campaign for a proper enquiry.

‘We need justice for our son.'

On his Facebook page Mr Rawal has written a tribute to his son, asking for friends and family to aid them in their quest for justice.

'By now you would have heard the tragic news that our son Ishan has been murdered. This happened on the inauguration day of our new hospital Royal Shanti Healthcare.

'We are thankful to you all for the support you have given to us in this difficult time.

'As Ishan was a British Citizen we have requested help from the British government.

'We request you all to help to get justice for our son so that this ghastly act is never repeated.'

The family are urging people to email the British High Commission in New Dehli at web.newdelhi@fco.gov.uk to support their quest for answers.
