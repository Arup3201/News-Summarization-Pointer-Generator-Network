Everyone thinks Best Western is a chain. It is not.

All hotels within the group are individually owned and managed - but they operate under the marketing umbrella of Best Western. 'Hotels with personality' is the group's current motto.

But my experience is that they differ enormously.

The George: A chain hotel - but one with a bit of a story, and a decent dose of character

There are smart ones and not-so-smart ones - and the George in Swaffham, Norfolk, belongs firmly in the second category.

It is quite posh from the outside: a former 16th-century coaching inn in a town that comes as something of an elegant, Georgian surprise.

Lady Hamilton, Nelson's mistress, lived here.

As did Howard Carter, who discovered Tutankhamun's tomb.

Our visit coincides with a coach party from Wolverhampton staying overnight.

We are all paying around £50 for bed-and-breakfast. Throw in dinner and it works out at no more than £70 for two people.

Our room (brown carpet and a whiff of cooking) is normally sold in conjunction with one opposite to create a family annexe.

So, rather than having an en-suite bathroom, we wander down the passage, and quite like the stroll.

But something odd is going on with the taps.

The water comes out of the shower only above the bath. There is no lever to direct it directly into the tub. And don't expect a bottle of designer water or much in the way of soaps and potions. Instead, there is a plastic cup wrapped in cellophane.

The restaurant is chokka, so we eat by the window next to the bar. On ordering drinks, they are handed to us over the counter. Lazy or relaxed? We're not sure. No-frills service, for sure.

But portions are generous, the atmosphere jovial and, if your visit coincides with a Saturday, the market in Swaffham is a joy.

In fact, in 2015, the market will be celebrating 800 years of trading - and the George will be looking on with pride.
