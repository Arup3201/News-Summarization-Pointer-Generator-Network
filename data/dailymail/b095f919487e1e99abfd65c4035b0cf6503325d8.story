A furious and sceptical senator has blasted a report by the House Intelligence Committee into the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, saying it is 'full of crap'.

Senator Lindsey Graham (R - South Carolina) said the results of the investigation, which clears the government of wrongdoing in its response to the crisis in Libya, are evidence of a 'lousy job'.

The document, released Friday, said the CIA, military, and the White House did their jobs right in the wake of a militant attack on the facility which killed a U.S. ambassador.

'Full of crap': Republican Senator Lindsey Graham lashed out at the report, which he said shows the GOP-led House Intelligence Committee is doing a 'lousy' job

Under attack: A vehicle and the surrounding area are engulfed in flames after being set on fire inside the US consulate compound in Benghazi late on September 11, 2012

But its analysis, especially the notion that nobody lied or covered anything up, struck the senator as 'complete garbage'.

Graham gave his forthright response in an interview on  CNN Sunday, and implied the report was untrustworthy because some of those involved in writing it had misled congressmen in a hearing on the attacks.

The fact that the House Intelligence Committee is dominated by Republicans did nothing to dampen his criticism.

When asked why the GOP chair of the committee, Michigan Representative Mike Rogers, would accept the report, he answered 'good question'.

According to Graham all the report proves is that the group 'is doing a lousy job policing its own'.

The two-year investigation of the politically charged incident determined that there was no intelligence failure, no delay in sending a CIA rescue team and no missed opportunity for a military rescue.

It also debunked allegations that the CIA was covertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria.

The final report: A two-year investigation by the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee has found that the CIA and the military acted properly in responding to the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya

Damage: A burnt house and a car are seen inside the US Embassy compound  following the overnight attack.  It was initially believed the attack was carried out by an angry mob responding to a video but was later determined to have been a terrorist attack

In the immediate aftermath of the attack, intelligence about who carried it out and why was contradictory, the report found.

It was that, the report said, which led Susan Rice, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to inaccurately assert that the attack had evolved from a protest which did not exist.

But the flaws, the report said, came from intelligence analysts who made mistakes, rather than politicians or an intent to mislead.

Many of its findings echo those of six previous investigations by various congressional committees and a State Department panel. The eighth Benghazi investigation is being carried out by a House Select Committee appointed in May.

The attacks in Benghazi killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith, and two CIA contractors, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty.

A Libyan extremist, Ahmed Abu Khatalla, is facing trial on murder charges after he was captured in Libya and taken to the U.S.

In the aftermath of the attacks, Republicans criticized the Obama administration Hillary Clinton, who was then secretary of state.

People in and out of government have alleged that a CIA response team was ordered to 'stand down' after the State Department compound came under attack, that a military rescue was nixed, that officials intentionally downplayed the role of al-Qaeda figures in the attack.

None of those allegations is true, according to the report.

The report did find, however, that the State Department facility where Stevens and Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack.

Previous reports have found that requests for security improvements were not acted upon in Washington.

'We spent thousands of hours asking questions, poring over documents, reviewing intelligence assessments, reading cables and emails, and held a total of 20 committee events and hearings,' said Rep. Rogers, along with his Democratic counterpart, Maryland Rep.  C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger.

'We conducted detailed interviews with senior intelligence officials from Benghazi and Tripoli as well as eight security personnel on the ground in Benghazi that night.

They said: 'Based on the testimony and the documents we reviewed, we concluded that all the CIA officers in Benghazi were heroes. Their actions saved lives.'

Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who serves on the intelligence panel and the Benghazi select committee, said, 'It's my hope that this report will put to rest many of the questions that have been asked and answered yet again, and that the Benghazi Select Committee will accept these findings and instead focus its attention on the State Department's progress in securing our facilities around the world and standing up our fast response capabilities.'

Senator Graham, however, has promised a 'hard review' of the report.
