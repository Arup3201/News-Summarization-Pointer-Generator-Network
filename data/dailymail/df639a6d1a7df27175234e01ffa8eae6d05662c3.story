Famous for her 'Chelsea blow dry' and bouncy curls, the Duchess of Cambridge has some of the most envied - and emulated - locks on the planet.

Her husband, however, begs to differ. The Duke of Cambridge on Wednesday joked about Kate's hair being a 'nightmare' during a private visit to the homeless charity Centrepoint.

In light of William's comment, FEMAIL takes a look back on the former Miss Middleton's ever-changing hairstyle. From her unkempt tresses in her university days to the sophisticated style she wears so well today, the 32-year-old has made the transition from long-haired student to glamorous future Queen with aplomb.

Not such a nightmare! Despite Prince William's comment about his wife's hair, there's no denying that the Duchess of Cambridge's glossy locks are some of the most envied on the planet

Going up in the world: Since announcing her second pregnancy, the Duchess of Cambridge has been sporting sophisticated chignon hairstyles, sometimes leaving the hair sleek and sometimes curling the ends

The pregnant royal started out as a fledgling princess with typically messy 'Sloaney' hair. In her twenties,  Kate favoured effortless curls, often brushed over to one side of her face.

Through the years, however, she has adopted a much more polished look. Kate has made glossy, bouncy, curled locks her signature and no matter how breezy it is outside, her perfectly coiffed hair always survives the elements.

Speaking about the royal's changing hairstyle, Bruno Marc, Southern Hairdresser of the Year 14/15, said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge knows what works for her and has continued to keep her locks looking luscious and volumised over the years. 

'Her look hasn’t changed dramatically, however, the condition of her hair has gone strength to strength with it looking more shiny than ever, especially during her first pregnancy.

'She has the best of both worlds whereby she can leave it down on a day-to-day basis. Alternatively, she can opt for an up-do for the more formal parties with a thick, fuller finish to compliment her overall look. It would be great to see her experiment with a bit of colour, perhaps some highlights to lighten her existing shade - something new for SS15.'

Indeed, in recent months, the royal, who has often been criticised for her unadventurous style, has been trialling new looks.

Perhaps in keeping with the current trend for up-dos, the Duchess has been sporting sophisticated chignon hairstyles, sometimes leaving the hair sleek and sometimes curling the ends into a low bun. 

'The more formal look is a good thing with long hair as it is nice to do something different without having to cut it, especially when you have different engagements to attend as many women do this time of year,' said Grant Badger, Salon Manager/Technical Director at ColourNation Hairdressers, London. 

New styles: Kate likes to leave her hair down on a day-to-day basis but has been opting for more up-dos at recent formal events

Signature style: Kate has made glossy, bouncy, curled locks her signature and no matter how breezy it is outside, her perfectly coiffed hair always survives the elements, making it one of the most envied heads of hair in the world

Thick and full: Want hair as thick as Kate's? Products like Nioxin Diaboost is a great product to penetrate the hair making it more manageable, free-flowing and full, say experts 

Hair through the ages: Kate showed off some grey strands on an outing in November last year, left, but paid a visit to the salon to ensure her locks were back to their glossy best

How does she do it? Even when she walked out of hospital straight after giving birth to Prince George in July last year, the Duchess of Cambridge's hair looked at its best

Shaking things up: Kate wore a natural style on Royal tour in September 2012, left, a pretty pearl embellished bun style in the same month, centre, and even tried out bangs in December that year, right

Even Kate suffers from a bad hair day: Her hair survives the elements most of the times but proving that she's just like us, even the perfectly polished Duchess suffers the occasional windswept moment

Get the look: Celebrity hairdresser Richard Ward, who has worked with Kate, pictured in (l-r) 2012, 2011 and 2012, said: 'Long hair is often in need of more attention. Maintenance is key - regular trims are essential to help prevent split ends and keep it healthy. It’s also important to use the right products; nourishing shampoos, conditioners and masques will help keep long hair feeling great and looking healthy'

Oh how things have changed! In her student days back in 2005, Kate's hair was a far cry from the glossy locks we know and love today

So how does Kate keep those locks so glossy and how can mere mortals replicate the look at home?

'The secret to caring for long hair like hers is ensuring you are using the right on your hair, explained Bruno Marc.

'Products like Nioxin Diaboost is a great product to penetrate the hair making it more manageable, free-flowing and full. It also thickens existing hair at the roots. It is also important to not expose the hair to too much heat, so letting it naturally dry and then blow-drying the ends or the roots to create volume or polishing up your natural finish.'

Celebrity hairdresser Richard Ward, who has previously worked with Kate, added: 'Long hair is often in need of more attention. Maintenance is key to caring for it - regular trims are essential to help prevent split ends and keep it healthy. It’s also important to use the right products; nourishing shampoos, conditioners and masques will help keep long hair feeling great and looking healthier in appearance.'

And, say experts, Kate may have her pregnancy to thank. 'Hormonal changes can make hair revert into one of three of its cyclical stages of hair growth; amongst other changes, pregnancy can make hair thicken and become more abundant in density,' explained Richard. 

'You may find also find changes in texture, appearance and even shape.'

However, life hasn't always been so glossy for the groomed royal. Like any woman, Kate hasn't been without the odd bad hair day. 

Kate was photographed with streaks of grey in her usually immaculate tresses in November last year. Like any woman would, she decided it was high time to invest in some serious post-pregnancy styling.

She booked an emergency appointment at the most expensive hairdresser in the country, then spent a marathon six hours being coiffed, coloured and blow-dried to ensure she was restored to her status as yummy mummy in chief.

According to The Mail on Sunday, Kate spent more than half a day at the luxurious Rossano Ferretti hair spa in central London where a haircut with Italian-born Mr Ferretti costs £600. 

Given the newly lustrous appearance of Kate’s locks, it most certainly worked. 

Iconic: Kate's hair is among the most envied by women across the globe - and, say, experts, it's all about giving her hair the right foundation: the best nourishing treatments on the market

'To recreate the iconic classic Duchess of Cambridge hair look I would recommend you begin with a good hair foundation and by this I mean a good shampoo and conditioner. I would recommend the Sebastian Hydre Shampoo, it is great to quench the thirst of moisture in your hair, leaving it silky and full of body. A good conditioner would be Wella SP Repair Conditioner as it effectively helps to repair and strengthen hair due to its formulation. To create the sleek, glossy, free-flowing hair that the Duchess of Cambridge is known for, I would finish the look with the Wella SP Luxe Oil as it is enriched with a blend of three precious and luxurious oils (Almond Oil, Argan Oil & Jojoba Oil), leaving your hair up to 10 times smoother with triple the amount of Keratin protection' - Bruno Marc

'For a bouncy blow dry, prep is key - spritz a setting spray like L’Oreal Professionnel tecni.art Pli Spray through damp hair for grip and hold, and a root-boosting spray like The Chelsea Collection Keratin Bulking Spritz for weightless volume. Medium-size heated rollers are ideal for creating body and bounce; finish the look with a hairspray like The Chelsea Collection Anti-Ageing Argan Hairspray for invisible, flexible hold', Richard Ward

'It's good to use an oil like Wella SP Luxe Oil for a lovely healthy shine and gloss and a volumising spray directly onto the roots, like the Sebastian Voluptuous Spray for extra body and bounce. Blowdry with a large round brush also using something like a Velcro roller to set the curls while finishing the blowdry. After taking out the rollers use a light brush-able humidity resistant spray such as the Sebastian Re-Shaper which is perfect to finish with as the hair will have hold while still being able to move,' Grant Badger
