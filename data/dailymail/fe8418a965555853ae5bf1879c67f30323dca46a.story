In the tunnel at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, it was easy to reminisce and think back to the time when Jose Mourinho told Frank Lampard he had become the world's greatest player.

The sad thing about these two, texting buddies when Mourinho was at Inter Milan and Real Madrid, is that they appear to have lost touch. Sometimes life moves on, too quickly in this case.

There was an uneasy handshake with Chelsea's manager, some skin on skin as Lampard settled into the visitors' technical area before the 1-1 draw, but it was not the same.

The Premier League board will decide whether to fine Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho for his latest vow of silence.

The Portuguese did not speak to the press following Saturday's clash with Manchester City after the FA banned Diego Costa. Last Friday's press conference was also cancelled. 

Premier League chiefs will write to Mourinho and Chelsea for their reasons before the case is taken to the board.

'I don't want to try to say that there's any issue at all,' admitted Lampard after his 13-minute appearance as a substitute for Manchester City.

'I got a text at Christmas, I texted him back. We spoke in the dressing room, 'How's the family?,' the usual.

'We are grown men, you know what I mean? We are at different football clubs. I'm sure we are big enough that none of this is going to get in the way of our relationship and how we are personally.

'We remain close. This is football, it's sport and I haven't spoken to him that much recently.

'I don't think there's room for bitterness and if there is then I'll deal with that down the line.'

Lampard dealt with his return to Stamford Bridge in the way that anyone who has come across him during his professional career would expect him to: unruffled, polite, respectful and courteous.

There were a few dissenting voices at Stamford Bridge when he appeared as a 77th-minute substitute for the champions but his return home went as well could be expected.

In the end, after these title rivals went away with a point each, Lampard went into the Chelsea dressing room to share some memories of the three Barclays Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the Champions League that they won together in Chelsea's golden era.

'It was lovely to get that reception at the end from the fans,' he added. 'I really appreciate that and I'm a lucky boy.

'I was nervous in general, to come here and be part of the away team is a bit nerve-wracking.

'I went in the dressing room afterwards and saw all the people behind the scenes, loads of faces, it was brilliant.'

Lampard still has the drive and the desire to add another Premier League title before he leaves City at the end of the season to move to New York City.

This result, if not the performance, suited leaders Chelsea and Manuel Pellegrini's team have their work cut out to retain the Premier League. Five points is a lot of ground to make up. 

'Chelsea finished the first half of the season with 45 points, so it could be 90 or more,' admitted Pellegrini.

'Of course the more points we drop the more difficult it is. We have to close a gap of five points, so it's important not to drop more points. But I'm sure all the teams will drop points.'

There is rarely any conviction or authority in Pellegrini's voice, but he knows what it takes to win the title after his side saw off the challenge of Liverpool last season.

Lampard has been there before and although his loyalty to Chelsea remains rock-solid, there were signs on Saturday that there is some genuine affection for City.

He agreed with the reaction of City's dressing room — they were convinced they should have won this game. Lampard's assessment was about right.

'In terms of chances in the first half, City were the stronger team and possession-wise in the second half,' he said.

'The result is probably better for Chelsea in terms of the league. We were in the dressing room there feeling that we probably might have won the game.

'It kind of leaves a nice balance. You lose that game and some people would write you off. This keeps the league ticking over.

'The race is on and you are talking about the two best teams in the country.'
