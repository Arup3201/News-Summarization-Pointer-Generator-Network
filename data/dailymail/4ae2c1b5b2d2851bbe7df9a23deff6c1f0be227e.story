A mother who lost her 16-year-old son in a skateboarding accident broke down in sobs as she listened to the heart that had belonged to her boy - now beating in a woman whose life has been transformed by the gift from the family.

Heath Eiland, from Austin, Texas, died in a skateboarding accident in May 2011 and his family decided to donate his organs so that others could find life despite the tragedy.

A little more than a year after Heath's death, his parents, Stephen and Becky, met two of the six people who received organs from their son in an emotional encounter on Sunday to celebrate the life that continues on.

Heart to heart: Becky Eiland weeps as she listens to her son's heart beating in Denise Miles, the recipient of his organ donation after his death in May 2011. Heath's father, Stephen (center in purple shirt), looks on

The sound of her son: Overcome with emotion, Becky Eiland places her head on Denise Miles' chest, to hear the heart that once beat inside her late son

The Eiland family arranged to meet the individuals that received life from Heath's organs at Saint Albert the Great Catholic Church in Austin, where their son had been baptized and received communion.

But nothing could prepare Becky for the overwhelming experience of listening to the heart that once gave Heath life - now giving life to another, Denise Miles.

At first Becky used a stethoscope to listen for Denise's heart beat and just hearing the repeating thumps caused the grieving mother to weep.

Heath's father, Stephen, said his son was always wanting to help others

But as she listened, Becky wanted to hear more clearly - so she gently rested her head on Denise's chest.

With tears rolling down the mother's eyes, she pondered the miracle of life being renewed in spite of her family's loss.

'It's hard to realize that his heart 
grew in my belly at one time and now his heart is in someone else giving
them life. Sometimes its hard to imagine,' she told KTBC-TV, as family and friends were gathered to witness the meeting. 

Miles, who is from San Antonio, traveled to North Austin to meet the Eiland family for the first time.

'He reminds me every day I got something good going on. I'm here for my son, and I'm here for my family,' Miles told KVUE-TV about the precious gift she received from Heath.

And Miles was only one of six people who was given a new chance at life from the organ donation.

Christopher Mendez also met the Eilands on Sunday. He had received the boy's liver.

Mendez said he had waited a year and three months to receive a liver transplant and is only alive today because of the gift.

'It literally is a miracle that can change someone's life, not only to prolong it, but make it completely better as in my case,' he said.

Heath Eiland, who was a sophomore at Anderson High School, died after he fell off his skateboard attempting a stunt without a helmet.

'Our friend was skating on this 
really big half pipe and he went face first into the ground,' a frantic 
teenage witness told the police dispatcher last May to report the 
accident. 

A heart comes home: Becky Eiland is in awe of the life that has been granted in spite of her family's loss

'It's like 20 to 30 feet and he's just bleeding intensely.'

After the accident, there was no chance of survival but the boy was kept on a ventilator so his organs could be donated.

'He helped people in his life,' his father Stephen said.

'This is just like Heath, so Heath-like to give something even after to give to other people to keep them going.'

'Heath was just a tremendous son. I'm just so proud of Heath in life and in death,' he added.
