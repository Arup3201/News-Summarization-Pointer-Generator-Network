That was a massive statement by England in Auckland, very encouraging indeed, but they need to start preparing immediately for a massive backlash from the All Blacks next week.

The gloves are off. England can bring their A game and their A team into next week’s game but so can New Zealand.

New Zealand looked flat and a little uninspired for parts on Saturday. It’s not easy playing your first game in six months with everyone expecting you to win by a cricket score - but they will be in top gear from the off next week.

Proud: England's players fought valiantly but were defeated by New Zealand in Auckland

England need to keep their feet firmly on the ground because it will be a ‘different’ New Zealand in Dunedin. And to counter that Stuart Lancaster will need a ‘different’ England team to match them.

The facts are England did not score a try and lost the game and they must improve by some margin to come away with a win.

The good news is that because of the schedule England are in the unusual position of having a lot of cards to play in the second Test.

Traditionally New Zealand can splutter a little in their opening Test of a home series before getting their act together and routing the opposition. They always gather momentum and sharpen up their game.

Stepping up: Freddie Burns was one of several fringe players who impressed against New Zealand

This time though England have some big-time players to reintroduce to the team and add momentum.

Despite some fine performances by the stand-ins - Freddie Burns, Ben Morgan, Kyle Eastmond, James Haskell, Rob Webber, Geoff Parling - England must go with their First XV, as close to the team that finished the Six Nations as possible.

The one thing England must not be thinking, even subconsciously this week, is that they are in a good place. They need to stay sharp and on edge.

The reality is that they are 1-0 down and will be facing a New Zealand team who will improve by at least 50 per cent. But England can reach another level as well.

The performances from the guys who stepped in yesterday add considerably to England’s strength in depth but now is the time for Tom Wood, Owen Farrell, Courtney Lawes, Luther Burrell, Dylan Hartley and Billy Vunipola to return, and Danny Care as well if he has recovered.

England have an opportunity to achieve something very special down in the ‘glasshouse’ but the gun needs to be fully loaded, England need to fire all their shots.

Physical: England went toe to toe with New Zealand on their own back yard in Auckland

It could be a fantastic spectacle and if England can win, if they can return home later this month with one Test win, it will be a huge boost to their World Cup prospects.

As for yesterday I’m not sure who the official man of the match was but England skipper Chris Robshaw was magnificent. It’s not often you see Richie McCaw so anonymous in a game. I can’t recall any turnovers from the New Zealand skipper or forcing penalties, which is normally his forte.

McCaw might have been just suffering from New Zealand’s general malaise but England’s directness and physicality at the breakdown helped negate him on Saturday.

Part of me still wants to see Robshaw at blindside in a big match - he could be phenomenal there - but it won’t happen on this tour. It can only happen if England have a world-class seven to slot in.

They do - but Steffon Armitage was playing for the World XV against the Boks on Saturday!
