As they stroll down a sun-kissed Spanish street, Tony and Cherie Blair appear to be slightly preoccupied.

And their distracted air is not all that surprising given that this was the first time in months they have been seen together in public.

During that period their marriage has been in the spotlight after allegations of a close relationship between Mr Blair, 60, and Wendi Deng, the former wife of Rupert Murdoch.

The media mogul has said he divorced his wife because of claims she was close to the former Prime Minister.

Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were pictured walking down a street in Marbella, southern Spain last month

The couple, who have been married more than 30 years, looked relaxed as they enjoyed the Spanish sunshine

The Blairs were 
photographed on holiday together in Marbella, Spain just over a week 
after Murdoch broke his silence on his and Miss Deng's divorce.

It
 was alleged in February that Miss Deng, 45, had written notes to 
herself praising Mr Blair’s ‘good body’ and his ‘butt’. In a list of 
reasons why ‘I’m so missing Tony’, she gushed in poor English about his 
‘pierce blue eyes which I love. Love his eyes. Also I love his power on 
the stage’.

Although
 there is no evidence that Miss Deng had an affair, the 83-year-old 
media tycoon said claims that Mr Blair secretly met his wife at their 
Californian ranch had played a major role in  his decision to end their 
 14-year marriage.

In
 Marbella, a stern-looking Mrs Blair, 59, opted for leggings under a 
floral print dress and sandals as she strolled with her husband.

The Blairs were last pictured together in public at Nelson Mandela's Memorial Service in Johannesburg in December

Murdoch said he went straight to a divorce lawyer after hearing claims Blair and Miss Deng had met up while he was away

Mr Blair, 60, his hair thinner and more grey than when he was in power, wore a linen shirt paired with a suit and loafers.

The
 Blairs were last pictured together at Nelson Mandela's memorial service
 in December, following last year's claims Mr Blair's friendship with 
Murdoch fell apart over secret meetings between him and Miss Deng.

Earlier
 this month, Murdoch, 83, confirmed he was prompted to file for divorce 
by claims of Miss Deng's closeness to the former Labour party leader.

Murdoch
 said friends had kept him in the dark over alleged meetings between the
 pair at Murdoch's Californian ranch while he was away.

He told Fortune magazine in the US: 'Well, you know, everybody was talking about these things and never telling me anything.

The Blairs were pictured laughing at their son Euan's wedding last September

‘Oh, s***, oh, s***.  Whatever why I’m so missing Tony.

'Because he is so charming and his clothes are so good.

'He has such good body and he has really really good legs Butt…And he is slim tall and good skin.

'Pierce blue eyes which I love. Love his eyes.

'Also I love his power on the stage…and what else and what else and what else...’

'But then I
 was told two pretty circumstantial things about the ranch. I was in 
Australia. When I got back, I naturally asked staff and it opened up,' Murdoch added.

'That's the story. And then, you know, a week later I filed. As soon as I could find a lawyer.'

Although he did not name Mr Blair, his comments tally with claims in Vanity Fair magazine linking Mr Blair to at least two suspicious trysts at the ranch with Miss Deng.

It
 was alleged in February that Miss Deng, 45, had written notes to 
herself in which she praised Mr Blair's 'good body', his 'really, really
 good legs' and his 'butt'.

It was claimed Blair visited Murdoch's ranch in Carmel, California while Murdoch was away and the media mogul only found out when staff told him

Last year Mr Blair was seen stepping out of a £7,000-an-hour bespoke 
aircraft (pictured) complete with stateroom, lounge, kitchen and bed as it emerged he was footing the bill for his own private transport

In a list of reasons why 'I'm so missing Tony', Chinese-born Miss Deng later gushed about his 'blue eyes which I love', it is claimed.

Mr Blair, who is godfather to one of Murdoch's daughters, has always denied any affair but has not spoken publicly about the claims.

He and Cherie have been married since 1980 and have four children; Euan, 30, Nicky, 28, Kathryn, 26, and Leo, 13.

They were together at Euan's marriage to Suzanne Ashman at All Saints parish church in Wotton Underwood, Buckingshire, last September.

The Blair's Spanish break comes two years after they last visited the Costa del Sol. In 2012 the couple were pictured visiting a friend's house in Benahavis near Marbella.

The holiday is the latest stop in Mr Blair's busy schedule, as he travels the world in his new roles as business consultant and public speaker.

In the last year he has been seen disembarking from a £30million private jet at in Bangkok, Sardinia and New York state, and the top-of-the-range Bombardier Global Express private jet has also been seen in Switzerland, Ukraine and Israel on dates which matched Mr Blair’s visits.
