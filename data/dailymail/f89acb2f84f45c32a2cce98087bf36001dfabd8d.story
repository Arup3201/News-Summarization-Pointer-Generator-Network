When on the BBC it was suggested to Sunderland manager Gus Poyet that the DVD of their thrashing at home by Aston Villa wouldn't make very edifying viewing, the phlegmatic gaffer replied 'you cannot pick what you like to watch'. 

Well, if Gus tuned in to watch his centre half Wes Brown on All Star Family Fortunes on Sunday evening, he might well have decided to pick up the DVD of that Villa game again, and stick it straight back in the recorder. 

Playing against soap and Strictly star Jill Halfpenny and her family, things were actually looking pretty good for the Browns at the start. As in, before they'd actually started playing.

The Browns appeared to have got host Vernon Kay onside early, but soon lost their advantage

The Halfpennys hail from the North East, while Wes was playing a flat back four of sister, brother, wife and mother-in-law from Manchester. This had the man in the middle, Bolton's own Vernon Kay, immediately looking to favour the team from the North West. 

But even with the man in black in their pocket, the Browns were still about to have an absolute mare. 

And just like on Saturday, it began badly, and just got worse. Wes was first up at the buzzer with Jill. And on beating her to the ball, suggested that the thing you'd hang onto when it was windy was 'a railing'. And our survey said... well, I'll leave you to do the noise. 

So the Halfpennys nipped in, and nicked the lead. Yet a couple of the Browns' other answers - namely 'a child' and 'the elderly' -  weren't far off, surely, from an actual correct answer 'somebody else'?

Frankly, the fact the Browns weren't surrounding the official on that one showed remarkable restraint on their part.

Then, before you could blink, the Halfpennys had doubled their lead. And this time, it was very much through a Wes own goal. Who, as we had seen earlier in the show - when discovering about him from his family on a home video they'd made - has his own mini cinema and a grand piano in the front hall. So it's not all bad, eh?

The challenge this time was to name a small bird. 'Pigeon', said Wes. Vernon did his best for him.

'Compared to an ostrich' was how he defended the defender's answer, but suffice to say... that noise again. 

Yet amazingly, there was arguably worse to come. The next question  had the Browns pondering a variety of potential trouser malfunctions you might have while wearing a pair at work.

I'm writing this sentence here now to give you a bit of time to think about a few possible answers for yourselves. 

I'll even point out, to give you a little more time, that Vernon did acknowledge that wearing trousers at work was not exactly in Wes' area of expertise. 

Wes said 'they'd changed colour'. Anyone else out there? Anyone? Frankly, this was turning into a rout. 

So even Wes was probably grateful when Vernon took time out to ask everyone to join him for a song from Wes' favourite musical - which happens to be the Sound of Music. 

That's right, Brown's fellow footballers. Just in case you think you might want to remind him of the fact next time you're with him in a dressing room or on the field of play. 

The Sunderland defender did however manage to raise plenty of money for charity 

Perhaps something along the lines of the fact that he clearly couldn't Von Trapp a house brick? No, too much knowledge, that. 

Wes did finally get off the mark with a correct answer about lying on a dating website, but when you looked up at the scoreboard come the end of the game, it was still something like 581 the Halfpennys, but most certainly the Browns close to nil. 

In the end then though, the plucky, affable footballer and his family still managed to raise money for their chosen charity. And did at least give it a bit of a go in the process. 

But all I can say if that if Gus had been in charge of this team's performance, chances are he'd have cleared his desk at the training ground and said goodbye to the players before you'd even had the chance to read this. 

No big deal though, Wes. Put that one behind you. You can fix it in the next game. You're away at Only Connect.
