For celebrities like Cara Delevingne, Simon Cowell and Rihanna a jet-set lifestyle can make it tough to stay fresh-faced. The latest fashionable answer? IV drips.

Cara, Rihanna and Lily Allen have all posted photographs of themselves on IV drips when their non-stop schedules have left them rundown.

Cara admitted she sought treatment to help with a cold and Lily conceded that her hectic travel schedule was catching up with her. 

Reviv IV vitamin drips will be available in the UK from September. Hydration treatments will be priced at £199 and Booster Shots £39

But such quick fixes haven't been available to the rest of us, at least in the UK, until now.

From September these boosts will be available up and down the country with Reviv offering IV Hydration treatments at £199 and Booster Shots for £39.

The treatments aim to help you look and feel your best. They deliver vitamins and 'wellness' agents quickly and efficiently– claiming to give you 100% of the benefits compared to 55% you get from tablets. 

CEO Johnny Parvani says the treatments are filling a huge gap in the 
market. ‘A lot of people don’t need to see a doctor but they are also 
not feeling 100%. They'd normally go to a doctor or to buy painkillers 
and medicines at a pharmacy. These treatments help them get back to 
feeling their best again and cut out the middle man.’

Sarah Lomas Vice President of Operations at Reviv says getting one of 
the shots in America changed her life and motivated her to set up the 
business. ‘I just kept thinking, when can I get this again and how? I was travelling all the time and exhausted. My life changed that day.'

On the menu for UK customers will be a choice of five IV 
Hydration Wellness options and three booster shots. The Hydromax, favoured by athletes, delivers 2 to 4 litres of saline to aid peak hydration; Ultraviv, a recovery infusion to ward of pain and nausea – i.e a hangover or jet lag; Vitaglow an anti-ageing infusion and Royal Flush, a deluxe treatment combining Ultraviv and Megaboost. The shots are B-12, Glutathione and Slimboost, which claims to rev up the metabolism and aid weight loss of up to 4lb in a week
 alongside healthy eating and exercise.

There's a sense of excitement amongst my fellow guinea pigs (including Towie's Amy Childs) as we prepare for our IVs.

We've heard whispers of the wondrous benefits – lose weight, boost immunity, cure a hangover, overcome jet lag.

Some claim the drips have banished all illness for more than a year – others say friends got pregnant soon after having one.

So I'm excited. Leading up to this I've worked and partied a little too hard. Unrelated, I've also been diagnosed with Costochondritis, a painful chest condition.

London's in the grip of a sweltering, sleep-preventing heatwave. I'm probably even feeling a tiny bit like Rihanna, Miley and Lily do. 

On the table in front of me lie my potential saviours.

A selection consisting of five IV Hydration Wellness options and three booster shots.  I'm advised to go for the Megaboost infusion that contains B vitamins, anti-ageing Glutathione and an energy booster.

I'm nervous. I've never been on a drip before. Tellingly, I've told my mother nothing about this as it would only have worried her. But I'm reassured by Reviv's medical approach (they have four physicians on the board). These days in Las Vegas, ‘party buses' offer IVs to revellers in need of a quick fix. Reviv is nothing like this.

I have a consultation with CEO Johnny Parvani who takes me through a detailed health check.I still feel slightly nauseous as my skin is pricked and then it's in.

It's at this point I learn that I have small veins – so rather than taking 30 minutes for the goodness to filter into my blood stream (the average time), it takes an hour, pretty unusual.

It feels cool – as in cold, not because I feel like Rihanna although that probably helps - because the fluid is below body temperature. I'd arrived with a headache, which disappears about half way through. When it ends I'm left feeling very clear-headed, the way you feel when you've put in brand new contact lenses with a new, sharper prescription. I feel, in essence, very alert.

Fans at the launch talked about the IV drip's benefits lasting for days – weeks – months even. About it helping them stay healthy and ward off colds and flu.

I'm hoping it will see me through another tough week of work, and perhaps I'll learn my lesson about partying too hard. Although miracles were never what Reviv promised.
