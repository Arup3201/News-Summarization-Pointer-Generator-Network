A blind man who put a note in a shop window seeking someone to read to him has been inundated with offers after his request was spread online.

Andrew Bailey, 34, has the degenerative disease Friedreich’s ataxia and has been un-able to read properly for 15 years. 

He asked one of his carers to write and place an advert in a bookshop seeking a person willing to read to him once or twice a week. 

Spreading the word: A passer-by spotted the note, pictured above, on Saturday and posted his plea on Twitter

A passer-by spotted the note on Saturday and posted his plea on Twitter. It has since been retweeted more than 1,250 times.

Another of Mr Bailey’s carers said yesterday there had been dozens of offers of help.

Mr Bailey, from Nunhead, south-east London, said: ‘It makes me feel very good really. There are nice people out there. It’s very reassuring.’ He said he finds that audio books can to sound ‘too robotic’. 

His message read: ‘There has been a huge empty space left in my life. I got much pleasure from reading.’

Mr Bailey, who took a degree in American studies at Northampton University, has about 100 books he would like read to him.

Among them are My Sister’s Keeper by Jodi Picoult and The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole by Sue Townsend. He also wants to hear books by Charles Dickens and his favourite author is John Grisham.

Mr Bailey first showed signs of Friedreich’s ataxia when he was four and began using a wheelchair at the age of 11.

He was registered blind five years ago. He needs 24-hour care and has difficulty hearing and speaking.

Dec Munro, from Crouch End, north London, who tweeted the advert, said: ‘It seemed like a nice thing to do. I absolutely love reading and the idea of not being able to do it is horrible. I didn’t expect anyone to retweet it more than about twice, never mind 1,000 times.’
