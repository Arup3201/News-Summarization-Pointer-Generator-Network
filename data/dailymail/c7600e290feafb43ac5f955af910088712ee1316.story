Another language: Children now use an entirely different form of communication to their parents

Children are always complaining their parents don't understand them - and it seems they're right.

The explosion in 'text speak' means many are now effectively using a different language.

Almost nine in ten parents and teachers say the abbreviated words and acronyms developed for speed when writing text messages have thrown up a language barrier between the generations.

And three-quarters said they frequently had to ask children to translate the contents of a text or email.

More than two-thirds of teachers also said the terms were now 'routinely' cropping up in essays and other work.

Adults reported messages from young children are becoming incomprehensible to them.

Examples include a text message a mother received from her eight-year-old child who wrote: 'Mum can M8 cotch at yard?'

This translates as: 'Mum, can my friend sleep over at our house this evening?'

Other popular words include rfd, meaning after, kwl, or cool, and churoo, or true.

Education experts yesterday warned schools' 'toleration' of the terms was 'eroding language'.

Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: 'Children use text speak all the time. It's incomprehensible to a lot of people but you're never going to get rid of it. It's a social phenomenon.

'The problem is schools go out of their way to accommodate it when they should be promoting the full versions of words.

'A lot of teachers say language evolves so you have to accept it. Fortunately, [Education Secretary] Michael Gove is introducing tests which are much more formal and based on English grammar.'

Tradition: Michael Gove plans to encourage the use of a more formal type of English grammar in schools

Almost a quarter of primary school children now go to school with a mobile, according to the survey of 500 parents and teachers for Del Monte.

This rises to 93 per cent of secondary school pupils, helping to embed text speak in common culture.

After - Rfd                    Oh my god - OMG

Tonight - 2nite             Laugh out loud - LOL

Great - Gr8                   Party - PRT

Before - B4                  Wait - W8

Tomorrow - 2moro      Wicked - WKD

Cool - kwl                     Hang out - cotch

Mate - M8                     Home - yard

Pizza - peetsa              About - abwt

True - churoo              Because - bcuz

That - dat                     Busy - bzy

Computer - compy     These - deez

face to face - f2f         Hate - H8

The difficulty adults have with the abbreviations was illustrated last year when it emerged text messages sent by David Cameron to former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks were mistakenly signed off 'LOL'.

The Leveson inquiry heard the Prime Minister thought it meant 'lots of love', when in fact it means 'laugh out loud'.

A recent Ofcom report on children's media habits revealed texting is most prolific among 12-15-year-olds, who send an average of 193 every week.

This was double the amount on the previous year and more than four times the UK average.Even eight to 11-year-olds were sending 41 texts each week.

Another survey of British adults found three-quarters believed words such as 'quashed', 'raconteur' and 'diabolical' have become outdated because of texting.

Frans Van Melis(CORR), vice president of Del Monte - which is sponsoring the Mencap School Spellathon, an online spelling bee - said the latest survey suggested text speak was eroding academic standards.

'The difficulty is that a lot of text speak is creeping into work that kids are doing in the classroom,' he added.

'Spelling has become much more fluid than it used to be which, on one level, is good - but, on another, doesn't help with academic attainment.'
