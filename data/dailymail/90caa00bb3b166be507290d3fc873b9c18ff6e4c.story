Hackers have stolen user information from crowd-funding website Kickstarter, the company revealed today.

Although no credit card information was taken in Wednesday's attack, the site said hackers made off with usernames, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers and encrypted passwords.

In an email to account-holders, Kickstarter CEO Yancey Strickler advised users to change their passwords to avoid having more information stolen.

'Actual passwords were not revealed, however it is possible for a malicious person with enough computing power to guess and crack an encrypted password, particularly a weak or obvious one,' he wrote in a blog post.

He added that 'as a precaution, we strongly recommend that you create a new password for your Kickstarter account, and other accounts where you use this password.'

No information is known about the hackers.

Kickstarter is a crowd-funding platform site for creative projects across film, books and the arts.

Since its launch in 2009, more than five million people have funded over 50,000 creative projects.

Strickler said law enforcement officials alerted Kickstarter on Wednesday that 'hackers had sought and gained unauthorized access to some of our customers' data'.

He said the company 'immediately closed the security breach and began strengthening security measures throughout the Kickstarter system'.

He said the company is working with officials to further strengthen the site's security to prevent future attacks.
