Forget squats and bicep curls – ballet is the new way to stay in shape in fashionable circles.

Model Jourdan Dunn started attending the BarreCore ballet studios in London last month. 

The studio claims the barre method of stretching helps women sculpt firm, elongated muscles while keeping their feminine shape and toning their tummy.

‘Jourdan’s been coming about once a day since her first class – she’s loving it,’ says a fellow class member. 

‘She is naturally co-ordinated, because of her modelling work, but barre involves holding poses for long periods of time and stretching out the muscles, and she had to pay attention to pick it up just like anyone else. 

'Now she’s been so often she knows what movement to do before the teacher announces it.

‘She often attends with some other gorgeous women, and now everyone makes more of an effort with their grooming and gym gear.’

Abs ahead: Jourdan Dunn

Coping with the challenges of secondary school can be much harder for teenagers with dyspraxia, a disorder that affects co-ordination and sometimes speech.

 In a survey by the Dyspraxia Foundation, 95 per cent of parents said their dyspraxic child experienced anxiety, including worries about being late for lessons. 

The charity has now produced a downloadable guide with useful tips for teenagers.

The blood test breakthrough

Donating blood will soon become much easier thanks to a device developed by the Australian Red Cross. 

The portable Virtual Vein Finder illuminates veins under the skin, allowing medical staff to insert a needle more accurately and painlessly.

The device, which uses infrared technology and haemoglobin, a protein found in blood, is especially useful on patients whose veins are difficult to find, such as the elderly and infants.

Sudden death research boost 

UK researchers looking into the causes of unexpected deaths in people with epilepsy are benefiting from cash pledged by the US Government.

 A team of scientists from University College London are studying the brains from those who died from Sudden and Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Each year in the UK, there are an estimated 600 cases of SUDEP.
