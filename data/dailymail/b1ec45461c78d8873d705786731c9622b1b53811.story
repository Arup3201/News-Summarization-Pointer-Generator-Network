It's here, but with some niggles: A small number of early iPhone 5 buyers have reported problems with their handsets

The iPhone 5 launch has been one of the biggest and most successful in history.

But that doesn't mean it has been without problems, with users who got their hands on early models reporting a wealth of problems.

The catalogue of complaints include faulty wi-fi connections and scratching on the aluminum casing, as well as confused weather reports from the voice-activated Siri assistant and reports of light 'bleeding' out from the side of the phone.

More disturbing seems to be the small number of handsets which 'rattle' when shaken - attributed to to a loose battery within the device, while other users are finding that their batteries drain within hours.

Users are also warned that the iCloud storage service run by Apple will be reduced from 20GB of storage space to 5GB at the end of the month - potentially placing back-ups at risk.

Alongside complaints about the patchy quality of Apple's new Maps app, the website Ars Technica collated a variety of bugs from Apple users, largely sourced from Apple's support forums.

It is not unexpected for some new devices to have manufacturing errors - particularly when five million products have been shipped within the opening weekend.

Even if just one per cent of the first batch of phones has an error, that is still 50,000 defective handsets in the market.

Some users are reporting problems with connecting to secured WiFi networks - with connections either being blocked or running slowly. Users on the Apple forums suggest this is a software issue which will be resolved with new firmware updates.

While the phone appears to be fairly 
resistant to scratching, there are also reports that the aluminium 
casing on the iPhone can wear off around the screen.

The LED backlight also reportedly 'bleeds out' from the screen, appearing as a thin white light around the edges of the screen.

For those who use Siri for their weather updates, many users are finding that the voice-activated personal assistant is mixing up its cities.

If you ask for the weather in New York City, Siri reports the weather for New York, Texas - yet on-screen it still says it is reporting on the city.

it is also confusing Richmond, Virginia with New Richmond, Ohio, alongside other place-names which appear more than once on a map.

Ars Technica finally warned that users will no longer be offered 20GB of free space when they sign up to iCloud - instead the space is plummeting to just five gigabytes.

This may not be enough to contain all your cloud back-ups - particularly if you own more than one Apple device - so users are warned they should consider paying Apple $40 a year, or risk losing their data.
