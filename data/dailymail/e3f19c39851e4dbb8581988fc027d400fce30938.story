A jellyfish with a powerfully toxic sting has been rediscovered more than 100 years after the last recorded sighting of it.

The incredibly rare Crambione Cookii has not been seen since 1910 but has been recently spotted off the coast of Queensland, Australia, where it was captured.

Not much is known about the mysterious species, which measures 50cm long and has a sting so powerful that it can be felt in the water surrounding the creature.

It was found by an aquarist who was releasing a rescued sea turtle. Puk Scivyer, who works at UnderWater World aquarium in Mooloolaba, said: ‘As soon as I saw it I realised it was a species I'd never seen before.

‘But to then discover I was the first person to see this species in over a hundred years was just incredible.’

She told Sunshine Coast Daily: ‘It was the size [that made it stand out]... but as we came past he was more of a cube shape and we could see he was not like the ones that we normally see.’

‘It’s the biggest [jellyfish] I have seen in Australian waters.’

Marine biologists are baffled as to how the species, which was presumed extinct, has managed to evade notice for more than a century.

The Crambione Cookii was last seen by American scientist Alfred Gainsborough Mayor off Cookstown, Queensland, in 1910.

His sketch was until now the only record of the creature in existence and was even used to help identify the animal by jellyfish expert Dr Lisa-Ann Gershwin, who confirmed the existence of unusual ocean-dweller after it was captured.

It is now being cared for at the UnderWater World aquarium in Queensland and will be observed closely behind the scenes to learn as much as possible about the species.

Currently scientists do not know where the animals live, their life expectancy or their population size,  and Ms Scivyer thinks it is unlikely that any more will be found.
