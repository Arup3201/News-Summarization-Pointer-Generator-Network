Two vulnerable single mothers were exploited by a cruel conman who pretended that he was terminally ill and had served in Afghanistan as a marine.

David Andrews has been jailed for 20 months for taking advantage of Heather Neal and Melanie Poynter before stealing from their children and selling their possessions on.

Norwich Crown Court heard how the fraudster won the sympathy of the two women by spinning a series of yarns about his past at a time when they were particularly defenceless.

Victims: Melanie Poynter, left, and Heather Neal, right, were exploited by conman and thief David Andrews

Andrews, 32, became 
involved with Miss Neal, 37, of Spixworth, Norfolk, in 
June 2012, telling her that he was suffering from cancer.

He
 persuaded her to take him for treatment at the Norfolk and Norwich 
University Hospital - even though there was nothing wrong with him.

While she waited in her car for him outside the hospital he would simply wander around the corridors to waste time and make her think he was seeing a doctor, the court heard.

He later stole an iPad belonging to her daughter and sold it.

Fraud: David Andrews told 'lie after lie' to 'weedle his way' into the single mother's lives

Andrews then targeted Miss Poynter, 33, of Cromer, Norfolk, and started a relationship with her.

He
 told her that he was a former Royal Marine who had shot children in 
Afghanistan and was therefore suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Andrews stole and sold an iPod, DS Lite and Xbox Connect belonging to Miss Poynter's daughter, while she was in hospital receiving treatment for a serious kidney condition.

The iPad contained the only pictures and video Miss Poynter had of her daughter taking part in the Olympic Torch relay in 2012.

Andrews, from Walcott in Norfolk, admitted two counts of theft and fraud by false representation.

Judge
 Stephen Holt said Andrews had told 'lie after lie' and had managed to 
'wheedle his way' into the lives of the women who were struggling to 
bring up their children.

He 
said: 'The lies you told were quite incredible. The bigger the lie, the 
more likely people are to believe it. In my view what you did was 
utterly despicable.

'This is one of the worst types of case, on its facts, of this particular offence that I've come across.'

Prosecutor Chris Youell said: 'Essentially he was living a lie, creating a back story to ingratiate himself to these women.'

Both victims read out victim statements in court, despite being reduced to tears by the crime.

Miss
 Neal said Andrews' lies were 'constant' and told how her daughter was 
'really upset' by the theft - thinking at first that a stranger had burgled their
 house.

She added that she now finds it 'very hard' to trust men.

Devastated: Miss Poynter and Miss Neal said that Andrews' crime had damaged their ability to trust others

Deceit: Andrews claimed to have been a Royal Marine, like the men seen here on a training exercise

Richard Wood, who defended Andrews, admitted that the offences were of a 'very unpleasant character' and 'wholly unacceptable'.

He said Andrews might need 'professional help'.

After the hearing, Miss Poynter described Andrews as 'evil'.

Sergeant
 Kevin White of Norfolk Police said Andrews followed the same pattern in
 manipulating both women and may have done it to others.

He urged anyone else affected by Andrews to contact police.
