Nigerian Kelechi Iheanacho caught the eye in Manchester City's 4-1 friendly win over Sporting Kansas City on Thursday. Here, Sportsmail's Adam Crafton runs the rule over the youngster.

Why are we interested in this young man?

Iheanacho played almost the full game as Manchester City began their tour of the USA with a 4-1 victory over Sporting Kansas City. He scored a late goal with an accomplished finish and produced an eye-catching performance.

So, how old is he and where did City find him?  

Iheanacho is just 17-years-old and he is a product of the Right to Dream Academy in Ghana. It is a registered charity that has been providing underprivileged African footballers with the opportunity for elite training programmes and international education. City have a positive relationship with the set-up and another forward, Godsway Donyoh, signed for City from there in January.

It seems, then, that City have great hopes for the young playmaker?

They certainly do. He joined the squad on the trip to Scotland for games against Dundee and Hearts and was then invited into Manuel Pellegrini's 23-man squad for the tour of the United States. Another Nigerian Chidiebere Nwakali, also went to Scotland.

Iheanacho sounds like quite a player, then?

At the Under 17 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates last year, he scored six goals in seven matches, winning the Silver Boot as the second highest goalscorer and the Golden Ball as the best player. After scoring for Manchester City on Thursday, Manuel Pellegrini said: ‘Kelechi is just 17 years old and he’s a very important player for us in the future. He demonstrated today what he can do in the future. It depends on the way he takes this profession, but I think he’s a good talent. He’s a very important player for the future for the club.'

Can we expect to see him in the first-team soon?

Possibly not. City are looking into whether they can secure a work permit for Iheanacho but they may have to loan him out to a club overseas until he is eligible to play in England.
