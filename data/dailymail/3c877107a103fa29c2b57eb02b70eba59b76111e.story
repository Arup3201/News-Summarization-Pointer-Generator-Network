A former financial analyst declared proudly that he 'personally carried out (the) executions' of two truckers in Dallas 15 years ago just minutes before he died snoring on Wednesday evening following a lethal injection.

Douglas Feldman, 55, was executed for the road-rage shooting deaths of Robert Everett, 36, of Marshfield, Montana, and Nicholas Valesquez, 62, of Irving.

Feldman mimicked a judge or jury announcing a verdict, using the names of his victims and declaring he had found them guilty of crimes against him.

'I have sentenced them both to death. I personally carried out their executions,' he said in a loud voice minutes before his death, adding that he carried out their executions in August 1998.

'As of that time, the state of Texas has been holding me illegally in confinement and by force for 15 years,' Feldman said. 'I hereby protest my pending execution and demand immediate relief.'

He appeared very nervous, breathing quickly and his feet twitching under a sheet. As the drug began taking effect, he grimaced twice, took a few deep breaths and began snoring. Then all movement stopped.

Still fuming: Fifteen years after a pair of North Texas road-rage killings put Douglas Feldman onto death row, the rage still appears to exist.

Feldman was pronounced dead 13 minutes after the lethal drug was injected at 6:28 p.m. CDT.

Feldman's
attorney, Robin Norris, filed a clemency petition with the Texas Board 
of Pardons and Paroles that was turned down Monday. Multiple courts, 
including the U.S. Supreme Court, earlier rejected his appeals on 
Feldman's behalf.

Feldman,
from Richardson, was riding his motorcycle the night of Aug. 24, 1998, 
and said Everett, driving an 18-wheeler, cut him off on a Dallas County 
freeway so he took out his 9 mm pistol, pulled up alongside the truck 
cab and shot him. Feldman testified at his capital murder trial that he 
was still angry about 45 minutes later when he spotted Valesquez, a 
gasoline tanker driver filling a Dallas service station, and shot him.

'A
security camera catches him shooting the man in cold blood,' Jason 
January, the former Dallas County assistant district attorney who 
prosecuted him, said. 'Several counties were frightened as this 
unidentified motorcyclist was out acting like "The Terminator."'

Death chamber: Feldman was pronounced dead 13 minutes after the lethal drug was injected at 6:28 p.m. CDT. at a Texas death chamber, like that pictured

Feldman
was arrested more than a week later, after shooting and wounding a man 
at a fast-food restaurant and driving off.

A bystander saw the shooting 
and reported his license plate number to police, who tracked him down 
and found Feldman with two pistols and nearly 300 rounds of ammunition. 
Ballistics tests confirmed one of the guns was used in all three 
shootings.

'It feels 
wonderful to cause their death and to watch their pain,' he said in one 
of 81 letters he wrote to a former girlfriend while awaiting his trial. 
The writings from the magna cum laude Southern Methodist University 
graduate were introduced into evidence.

'God
forbid I ever had my finger on the button to launch a nuclear explosive
device because I guarantee that I would wipe as many of these bastards 
off the face of the planet as I am able!' he said in another letter.

Without remorse, he also acknowledged the killings while testifying at his capital murder trial.

Evidence
showed he got into trouble as a juvenile, had drug possession and 
selling issues and wound up in state custody. He also had robbery and 
drug convictions.

First victim: This is the scene of the first murder committed by Mr. Feldman

While in 
prison, records show Feldman racked up 136 disciplinary cases, including
one for ripping out the phone in a visiting cage where death row 
inmates are interviewed by reporters. Texas prison officials 
subsequently refused him media access.

The day before the fatal shootings, evidence showed he shot up a Volkswagen dealership where he once had some work done.

'His
statement just showed more of the heart of the man,' John Everett said 
after witnessing the execution of his brother's killer. 'Very dark and 
very evil and very unremorseful.'

'I
was 12 when it happened,' Robert Everett's daughter, Emily, said. 'Now 
I'm grown, married, with kids, and my dad didn't get to see any of that.
I feel my dad finally has justice after 15 years.'

Feldman
became the 11th prisoner executed this year in Texas and third this 
month. At least seven other inmates are scheduled to die in the coming 
months in the nation's busiest capital punishment state.

Texas
Department of Criminal Justice officials declined to make Feldman, 55, 
available to reporters ahead of his scheduled Wednesday evening execution, because of his continued rage.

Psychotic: Mr. Feldman said he would kill the journalist interviewing him, his cameraman and another man off camera if he had a gun

One media 
session several weeks ago never even began, because he ripped the 
telephone from the visiting cage outside death row and became 
disruptive. It was among the 136 disciplinary cases Feldman's 
accumulated in prison.

'He's
a memorable character, a dangerous person in any setting,' Jason 
January, the former Dallas County district attorney who in 1999 
prosecuted Feldman for capital murder, said earlier this week. 'He threatened to kill me 
personally.'

The dead man's two truck 
driver victims were killed about 45 minutes apart on August 24, 1998. 
Prosecutors said Feldman became enraged after Everett cut him off, so he
shot him and then later, simply because he was still angry, shot 
Velasquez.

Feldman was the 503rd inmate to be put to death in Texas since reinstatement.

Feldman's
attorney, Robin Norris, filed a clemency petition with the Texas Board 
of Pardons and Paroles that was turned down Monday. Multiple courts, 
including the U.S. Supreme Court, earlier rejected Norris' appeals on 
Feldman's behalf.

At 
Feldman's murder trial, prosecutors produced evidence of numerous 
confrontations initiated by Feldman, including one where he jumped on 
the hood of another driver's car, smashed it with hammer, and then used 
the hammer to beat the windshield, a door and the driver.

'I have come to hate every single 
person on this planet with all my heart and soul,' he told a former 
girlfriend in one of 81 letters to her while awaiting trial. 'If I had a
button which would kill every single person on this planet, I would 
push it with no hesitation whatsoever!'

Evidence
showed Feldman was riding his Harley-Davidson bike on U.S. Highway 75 
just north of Dallas when the 18-wheeler driven by Everett passed and 
then pulled into Feldman's lane.

Feldman was enraged, pulled out his 
pistol and fired several shots at the back of the truck trailer. Then he
reloaded and pulled up alongside the truck cab.

'I chased Mr Everett down and I shot him to death,' Feldman testified at his trial. 'I felt like I needed to stop that man.'

Eleven miles later, and after circling back to make sure Everett was dead, Feldman spotted Velasquez, driver of an Exxon fuel tanker, replenishing tanks at a Dallas gas station.

'I exploded again in anger,' he testified. 'I drove by and shot him. It was just acting out. I felt emotionally compelled and consumed by anger.'

'I have found it quite pleasurable to kill those two men,' he said in another letter to his ex-girlfriend.

The day before the fatal shootings, evidence showed he shot up a Volkswagen dealership where he once had some work done.

Feldman was arrested about a week later after shooting a man outside a fast-food restaurant.
