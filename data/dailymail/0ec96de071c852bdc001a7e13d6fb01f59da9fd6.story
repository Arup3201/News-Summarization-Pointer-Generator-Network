Scaling the world’s highest peaks or trekking through the rainforest are adventures many dream of for a lifetime.

Navigating the murky waters of the Thames in a rowing boat? Perhaps not quite so much. Yet that trip has been ranked alongside the likes of climbing Everest and rafting the Amazon as one of the greatest experiences in the world.

It joins a list, compiled by influential guidebook firm Lonely Planet, which also includes tracking mountain gorillas in Uganda and diving with sharks in South Africa.

Recommended: The guide suggests that a trip to the Himalayas is a good choice for a foreign adventure

Amazing adventures: The Lonely Planet list also includes tracking mountain gorillas in Uganda

Beautiful: Other experiences closer to home include walking around the coast of Devon and Cornwall (pictured)

But there’s room for other experiences closer to home, too, such as walking around the coast of Devon and Cornwall and mountain biking in North Wales.

The Lonely Planet Great Adventures guide
describes rowing the Thames as ‘like sitting on a conveyor belt 
watching living history pass you by on both banks.’

It continues: ‘It’s a gallery of architectural evolution, meandering majestically through rural and city life, allowing you time to reflect on the meaning of all the bustling hustle onshore.’

For the ultimate experience, the guidebook recommends following the example of Jerome K. Jerome’s 1889 book Three Men in a Boat, and going in a skiff.

The 215-mile journey is featured in a list of 15 water experiences that include rafting the Amazon, kayaking in Antarctica and tracing the source of the Nile.

In the hiking section, alongside 
trekking in Nepal and touring Mont Blanc, the guide recommends walking 
the South West Coast Path from Dorset to Somerset, taking in Devon and 
Cornwall along the way.

The 630-mile path is described as ‘walking at its most diverse, most spectacular and most delicious’.

The
guide recommends enjoying a Cornish pasty while walking along the 
causeway at low tide to St Michael’s Mount near Penzance in Cornwall, 
and visiting fishing villages such as Port Isaac, Polperro and Penberth.

‘It’s a cracker,’ it says.

‘The
sea is a constant companion; the cliffs are immense and varied, ranging
from outcrops steeped in Arthurian legend to Jurassic remnants thick 
with fossils.’

But those attempting the walk are warned to allow plenty of time, as it takes between seven and eight weeks.

Six of the 75 activities listed in the guide are found in this country.

Other
British entries include mountain biking in Coed-y-Brenin in North Wales
and the Three Peaks Challenge – climbing Britain’s highest peaks in one
day.

Caving in the Peak 
District of Derbyshire is also featured, along with ‘coasteering’ in 
Pembrokeshire in South Wales. This is the act of jumping from, swimming 
alongside and scrambling from seaside rocks.
