A grandfather wrestled a seven feet alligator in order to save his dog which had been dragged into the water by the hungry reptile.

Steve Gustafson, 66, was tending to his garden when he heard the terrified yelps of his West Highland Terrier Bounce coming from the garden

The retired lawyer did not think twice about his own safety when he jumped on top of the alligator and forced it to let go of his ‘best friend’.

Hero: Pensioner Steve Gustafson wrestled an alligator to save his 'best friend' Bounce's life

Miraculously neither Steve nor Bounce was seriously injured.

Mr Gustafson, from Iowa, told ClickOrlando: ‘Without thinking I just said “you're not going to get her!” and just leaped on the gator.

'Just like you do some silly belly flop in a pool - the only difference was I landed on top of a gator.’

The incident took place on Friday 
afternoon when nine-year-old Bounce was playing at the edge of the pond 
in the retirement community in Orlando, Florida where she lives with 
Steve.

No fear: Steve Gustafson fought off an alligator to save his beloved pet

The predator came up from the water and got the little dog by her shoulder and collar and began dragging her out into the water.

Horrified, Steve ran down the hill and jumped after her, landing on top of the 130 lbs alligator.

Thanks to his position, Mr Gustafson 
managed to get hold of the alligator’s tail and back leg and began to 
wrestle the reptile to make it let go of the 13lbs terrier locked in its
jaws.

The alligator dragged them underwater but Mr Gustafson managed to stabilise himself and overtook the animal.

‘Since
we were only in three feet of water, I made a big push back towards the
shore and when I did that the gator let go of Bounce and turned around 
and bit me.’

As the alligator snapped, Mr Gustafson got hold of its snout, lifting it by its tail and released it back into the water.

The animal admitted defeat and retreated whilst Mr Gustafson brought Bounce ashore.

The
pair received medical treatment, but apart from a few stitches to his 
hand, Mr Gustafson said both he and Bounce are doing fine.

Florida Fish and Wildlife 
Conservation Commission official Patrick Delaney said due to the high 
temperature, alligators metabolisms are currently higher than normal and
small animals the size of Bounce are seen as easy prey.

He
added that the agency do not recommend others to follow in Mr 
Gustafson’s footsteps, even if the alligator is attacking a beloved pet,
as the outcome could be deadly.

‘They're fast, and they can be dangerous,’ Delaney said. ‘So, I would give them a healthy respect.’

Defeated: The alligator was later captured and killed

Prey: The alligator attacked Bounce when she was playing by the water's edge in Mr Gustafson's backyard

However, Mr Gustafson said that he did not have time to think about the danger when he went after the alligator.

‘I didn't have a choice’ he said. ‘If I hesitated I would have lost my best friend.’

The attacking alligator was caught by a trapper a few days later and Mr Gustafson has purchased the dead reptile.

He said he plans on sending it to a taxidermist to keep as a reminder of his love for Bounce and their lucky survival story.
