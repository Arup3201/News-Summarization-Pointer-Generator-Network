All that was missing was a rubber duck for this panda who splashed around in muddy waters during its bath time in an animal reserve. 

The two-year-old animal was left even dirtier than before when he rolled through branches and leaves before plunging into his bathing pool at the Bifengxia panda reserve in Chengdu, China. 

The cub, who spends most of its time sleeping or snacking on bamboo, was captured fooling around by a photographer who happened to be volunteering at the centre.

The adorable panda certainly wasn't shy of the water when it came to bath time at the enclosure in Chengdu, China

David Jenkins, 41, was on his lunch break at the reserve when the playful panda emerged to have a wash.

'Most of the time I visited this area of the reserve the pandas were sleeping or feeding but every so often I got lucky and found them going wild.

'I spotted the panda in this set of photos rolling around in a concrete bathing area, he was there for about 30 minutes and every so often he would climb up the nearby and roll down over and over again until he hit the water.

'Unfortunately my lunch break was over all too soon but I could have watched the panda for hours, it was very entertaining to watch.

The animal ended up filthier than it was before his bath, with leaves and branches sticking to his wet coat of fur

The Bifengxia panda reserve is a favourite among travelling animal lovers who can feed the animals and clean out their enclosures

'The park was not busy that day and these pandas were very far from the main gates, amazingly it was only me who got see it.

'It was definitely enjoying its bath time!' 

The Bifengxia panda reserve is a favourite among travellers and animal lovers who wish to interact with animals directly.
