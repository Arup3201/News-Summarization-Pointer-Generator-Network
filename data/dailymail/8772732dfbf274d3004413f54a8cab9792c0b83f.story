Brazil's patent authority has taken a bite out of Apple after ruling that the iPhone name belongs to a local company, not to the global computer giant.

The verdict won't forbid Apple from using the name in Brazil, but it makes it clear the rights belong to local consumer electronics firm Gradiente.

The São Paulo-based company's request to use the iphone trademark was granted in 2008, and the company started making 'iphones' - with a lowercase 'p' - in December.

The new iphone... which runs on Android: Brazilian company Gradiente have tried to cash in on the Apple gadget's cult status with this cheekily named smartphone

The company was the first to make cellphones in Brazil, and launched the first national smartphone in 2004.

Their phones are entirely different 
from Apple's flagship mobile device. For starters, the Gradiente iphone 
runs on the Android operating system, developed by Apple rival Google 
Inc.

And it doesn't come anywhere the specs of Apple's flagship gadget, nor does it look much like it's namesake.

Dubbed the Gradiente iphone Neo One, 
using a 700MHz processor it splashes Android 2.3 Gingerbread onto a 
3.7in capacitive touchscreen display.

The dual-sim phone comes complete with
two cameras, front and back, with 0.3 and 5 megapixels resolution 
respectively, but no flash - although if you live in sun-soaked Brazil 
you might not need it.

It also has lower screen resolution, 
weighs more than the Apple phone, and sells for a fraction of the price 
at 599 Brazilian Real - about £180.

Head to head: Name aside, there are few similarities between the iphone and Apple's genuine article, right

One in every two smartphones sold worldwide is made by either Apple or Samsung, research has revealed.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, the mobile device arch-rivals accounted for 52 percent of smartphone sales, up from 46 percent in the third quarter, according to tech market research firm Gartner.

Sales of mobile phones around the world fell last year for the first time since 2009 as consumers shunned cheaper feature phones, the company said yesterday.

'Tough economic conditions, shifting consumer preferences, and intense market competition weakened the worldwide mobile phone market,' said Gartner analyst Anshul Gupta.

But smartphone sales continued to rise, he said. Higher-end devices would account for more than half the market for the first time this year.

Total worldwide mobile sales to end users fell 1.7 percent to 1.75 billion units in 2012.

Samsung and Apple continued to dominate the market, with the Korean company selling 385million phones in 2012, of which 53.5 per cent were smartphones, with Apple selling 130million smartphones.

Chinese company Huawei reached third spot in worldwide smartphone sales for the first time in the fourth quarter, Gartner said. It sold 27.2million smartphones in 2012, up 74 per cent. 

Gradiente filed its request to use the
iPhone brand in 2000, believing that 'there would be a technological 
revolution in the world of cellphones, with the convergence of 
transmission and reception of voice and data via mobile Internet,' it 
said in a press release.

The verdict won't forbid Apple from 
using the name in Brazil, but it makes it clear the rights belong 
Gradiente, said Marcelo Chimento, a spokesman for the country's national
patent office.

Stopping Apple's use of the name is 
beyond the patent office's remit, and would have to be decided in court.
Another option is for the two companies to reach an agreement, he 
added.

The issue in Brazil is reminiscent of 
one that arose in the United States in 2007. Cisco Systems had owned the
iPhone trademark since 2000, and had been using it for a line of 
Internet-connected phones.

Once Apple announced its intention to 
use the brand name, Cisco sued it in San Francisco federal court. The 
two companies settled out of court six weeks later, without disclosing 
the terms.

The latest dispute is likely to be 
resolved the same way, with Apple probably choosing to pay the Brazilian
company for the right to use the iPhone brand in Latin America's 
largest country, a telecommunications analyst told the Associated Press 
in December.

This seems the best option for Apple, 
because it 'doesn't want to stop selling its product in Brazil,' said 
Eduardo Tude, president of Brazilian telecommunications consultancy 
Teleco.
