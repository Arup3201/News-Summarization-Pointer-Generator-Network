Courage: Sq Ldr Wilson Charlton won the George Cross for his bravery

Medals belonging to an unsung war hero who saved countless lives by defusing 200 bombs in 60 days are expected to fetch £25,000 when they go under the hammer at auction this week.

The incredible story of how Squadron Leader Wilson Charlton showed nerves of steel and 'unfailing courage' in his death-defying work, which saw him deal with an average of three live bombs a day, came to light after his George Cross and five other medals were put up for sale.

The RAF bomb disposal expert was awarded the prestigious George Cross after working tirelessly day and night to make safe the UXBs that were dropped by the Luftwaffe at the height of the Battle of Britain.

The sale of the medal will take place at Bosleys in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Wednesday.

Sq Ldr Charlton, originally from Northumberland, was based in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, defusing unexploded bombs falling on or near aerodromes and factories.

The medal he received in recognition of his bravery is the second highest given out in the UK, and the highest gallantry award for action not in the face of an enemy.

The courageous military man was later sent to the Far East to train troops in bomb disposal but was captured in Java by the Japanese in 1941.

He twice attempted escape, once successfully, first by rebuilding a bomb damaged aircraft and then by constructing his own boat.

Sq Ldr Charlton sadly died in 1953 aged 46, with his medal coming into the hands of a collector in Surrey.

The gong is now being sold along with the heroic airman’s other war medals, including a 1939-1945 star, a Pacific star, the RAF long service award and a medal for good conduct .

Steven Bosley, of Bosley’s auctioneers of Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said: 'What this chap did in such a short space of time is beyond phenomenal.

'Some of these bombs were new to the British at the time and a lot of his work would have been quite experimental and therefore even more dangerous.

'He would have worked day and night on these bombs and could easily have taken hours to defuse each one.

'He must have been exhausted at times but had to be alert because he was obviously dealing with a life-of-death situation.

'Although he had to cover a rural area, air fields and factories in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire were targeted by the Germans.

'Speed would have been of the essence
 at the aerodromes as this was September and October 1940, which was the
 height of the Battle of Britain, and we needed to get our lads up in 
the air again.

'Wilson Charlton probably crammed years of experience into just two months and his knowledge in defusing bombs became valuable.

'Going to the Far East at that time 
with the Japanese on the advance would have been like jumping from the 
frying pan and into the fire. It was no cushy number.'

After being taken prisoner, Sq Ldr 
Charlton led a group of men at a captured airfield in repairing an old 
Dutch Air Force plane with the aim of flying to Australia.

But they had to abandon the escape 
attempt at the last minute as it was made clear that reprisals by the 
brutal Japanese guards on the rest of the camp would be meted out in the
 event of an escape.

He managed to escape months later 
with another group of men who made their way to the coast of Indonesia 
where they started to build a boat before being captured.

Sq Ldr Charlton was freed at the end of the Second World War in 1945.
