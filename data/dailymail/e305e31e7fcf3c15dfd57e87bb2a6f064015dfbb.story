From a flurry of delighted children sledging down a snow-swept street in Bath to policemen joining in with group of teenagers having a snowball fight in Poole - your pics are helping us capture Britain as it is swept by snow.

Whether it be a snow-topped castle, or a blizzard in full force, we asked our readers across the UK to send in their best pictures, capturing the effects of 2013's first cold snap.

Readers from all corners of the UK - from Plymouth to Middlesbrough - sent in their snow-tinged pictures.

Whether it was beautiful scenery or just somebody having fun, Mail Online has been inundated with beautiful images from around the UK and is grateful for all the stunning pictures that have helped us to share the experience with readers across the country.
