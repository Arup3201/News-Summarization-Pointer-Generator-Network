The daughter of Casey Kasem has written a scathing open letter slamming her step-mom’s bizarre decision to bury her father in Norway.

Kerri Kasem said she wants to ‘set the record straight’ about where her dad wanted to be buried and pleads with Norwegian government officials: ‘Do not be fooled into believing his wife, Jean Kasem.’

In the heart-felt letter, addressed to 'whom it may concern', Kerri wrote: ‘As beautiful as your country is, our father has never spoken of any desire to be buried in Norway either to us or to his friends. In fact, it was the opposite.

Ongoing conflict: Casey Kasem's children and friends claim that he always wanted to be buried in California, rather than Norway as his second wife Jean is seeking to do. Jean and Casey are pictured in 2004 at the Beverly Hills Hotel in California

‘Casey wanted to be buried in his hometown of Los Angeles, California, his home of over 53 years.

‘Do not be fooled into believing his wife, Jean Kasem, who abandoned and isolated him during the last year of his life.’

Kerri insists Jean is ‘not by any means of Norwegian descent’ and claims Jean’s grandmother is not Norwegian as the statuesque blonde claimed. 

‘In fact, here is a quote from Jean's nephew Herbert "Tommy" Thompson who was named after Jean’s father, "As far as we know, we are English, German and Native American. We have never ever heard anyone speak of Norway or Norwegian for that matter in our house. We don't have an ounce of Norwegian blood to our knowledge,'" Kerri wrote.

Kerri says she believes the ‘representations’ Jean made in a letter to the Norwegian government have been ‘perpetuated by not only Jean, but her daughter Liberty because of the ongoing investigation from local authorities of criminal elder abuse.’

She added: ‘We beg you, to please decline the request of Jean Kasem and her daughter Liberty to bury Casey Kasem in Norway.’

The heartfelt letter is signed by Kerri, her sister Julie and brother Mike and Casey’s brother Mouner, as well as several other members of the Kasem family and several of Casey’s close friends.

Accompanying Kerri’s letter shown exclusively to MailOnline was a letter from Casey’s best friend former Lt. Governor of California Mike Curb.

Casey asked Mike in 2010 to be buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Burbank, California, because he foresaw something like this happening with Jean, according to Kerri’s publicist Danny Deraney.

‘Mike back in 2010, offered to pay for the funeral and told Casey he would do everything in his power to make sure that happened,’ he said.

In Mike’s letter to ‘whom it may concern’ he writes: 'I've been Casey Kasem’s best friend for close to 50 years and Casey always wanted to be buried in California.'

Jean Kasem’s plans to bury her husband in Norway, were first confirmed by her publicist last week.

She had already made arrangements for her husband's body to be flown to Oslo, the publicist said, after claiming that she has Norwegian heritage.

Family and friends of the late radio star vowed to fight the plan and Casey’s daughter Kerri intended to contact the Norwegian government expressing her dismay at the situation.

Embarrassingly for the statuesque blonde, one of her nephews revealed how his aunt did not have ‘an ounce’ of Norwegian blood in her.

Tommy Thompson, the son of one of Jean’s siblings, said: ‘As far as we know, we are English, German and Native American.

‘We have never ever heard anyone speak of Norway or [speak] Norwegian for that matter in our house. ‘We don't have an ounce of Norwegian blood to our knowledge.’

Casey's family are now working with L.A. private investigator Logan Clarke but have few legal options to prevent the overseas burial, the family’s publicist Danny Deraney said as Jean is the conservator of Casey’s body.

Mr Deraney said last week: ‘As you may have seen, Jean Kasem is planning to attempt to bury Casey Kasem in Oslo, Norway. She sent an open letter to the Norwegian government declaring among other things, her Norwegian ancestry.‘

The children, the family and friends want Casey Kasem to be buried in the place he requested, Forest Lawn in Glendale. Not to a foreign country he has never visited.’

Kasem, host of American Top 40 and the voice of Scooby-Doo, died on June 15 at a hospital in Gig Harbor, Washington. 

He was 82 and suffering from dementia and other health problems.

His death followed a lengthy battle over his care between Jean, who was married to him for 34 years, and his three adult children from his first marriage.

The Norwegian newspaper VG reported that Kasem will be buried in Oslo but it was not known when the burial may occur.

'It's been arranged, he's going to Oslo,' Wenche Madsen Eriksson, the head of the funeral service administration in Oslo, told the newspaper.

Casey’s body is currently believed to be in Montreal, Canada, after it was apparently shipped there on July 14 - a month after his death - by Jean against the wishes of most of his family.
