A couple have been arrested after allegedly leaving a baby in a freezing car outside while they had sex inside their feces-filled home.

Louis Thomas Cope and Katrina Marie Norman, were detained by police after officers found an infant inside a minivan with the driver and passenger door completely open in temperatures below freezing.

Police were initially called to the house in Gwinett County, Georgia after a complaint regarding animals at the property.

When officers arrived at the home in Snellville , they found the baby in the vehicle and when they knocked on the door, Norman 32, answered after several minutes wearing a pink lace suit and a blanket.

According to a police report obtained by the Gwinett Daily Post, the responding officer wrote: 'Based on their appearance it has appeared they had left the child in the vehicle while having intercourse.'

Cope, 23, reportedly told police that he and Norman had just returned from food shopping when Norman surprised him with pink lingerie.

The couple insist that the child wasn't left unsupervised for more than a few minutes, but authorities say they had been on the scene nearly 15 minutes before the pair emerged.

The report also added that once police entered the house, there was a strong smell of urine and feces and there was trash thrown about the floor with animal feces in children's bedrooms.

The report by the officer also added: 'I saw a knife lying on the ground within reach for a child to grab and hurt themselves.'

Police also described the baby and the other two children living at the house as deprived.

The pair have now been charged with maintaining a disorderly house and second-degree cruelty to children, which is a felony.

Both have since been released after posting $16,900 bonds.

Online booking sheets at Gwinett County jail also revealed the tattoos adorning both suspect's bodies with Cope's arm saying 'Family forever' and Norman's back saying 'Partners in crime.'
