Lemon slices and a spread of hummus and crudite are just some of Hillary Clinton's demands when she gives her $300,000 guest lectures.

Her requests were detailed in emails exchanged between officials at the University of California at Los Angeles and Clinton's representatives.

The correspondence, which took place over nearly a year,  was obtained by The Washington Post under a Freedom of Information Act request.

The exchanges  reveal five days her representatives requested the award (pictured) she was to be presented with should be in a box - not draped around her neck

Her representatives asked for a case of still water, room temperature, to be deposited on the stage.

They also requested that 'a carafe of warm/hot water, coffee cup and saucer, pitcher of room temperature water, water glass, and lemon wed­ges' be situated on a table on stage.

They also wanted them to be placed in another room where Clinton would stand for photos with VIPs -  the agreement was she would pose for individual photos with 100 VIPS, or 50 couples.

For the green room, Clinton's representatives requested: 'Coffee, tea, room temp sparkling and still water, diet ginger ale, crudité, hummus and sliced fruit.' 

The university had to buy a a computer, mouse and printer, as well as a scanner,for her visit.

The emails reveal university officials debating the style and color of the  armchairs for Clinton and moderator at her Luskin Lecture for Thought Leadership speech on March 5, 2014 as well as the pillows.

Her representatives requested two long, rectangular pillows be put on the chairs. 

Clinton says all of the money she receives from speaking engagements goes towards her family's charity, the Clinton Global Initiative

The exchanges also reveal five days before the lecture Clinton’s team rejected the podium planned for her use and had to get an new one and rent a new university seal to match and that the award she was to be presented with should be in a box - not draped around her neck.

The university asked whether there was a reduced rate for public universities to which they were told $300,000 is the 'special university rate.' 

The likely 2016 presidential candidate fees have been well-documented. 

Earlier thus year she defended the nearly quarter-million dollar fee she charges for speaking engagements at colleges and universities after students at one university demanded that she return the fee.

Clinton said that the enormous sums of money she has collected for speeches have gone towards her family's charity, The Clinton Foundation.

Clinton's wealth has been under scrutiny since an interview earlier this year in which she described her family as 'dead broke' and in debt when husband Bill Clinton left the White House in January 2001.

Combined, Bill and Hillary Clinton have a net worth of more than $100 million

 The potential 2016 presidential candidate later called that description 'inartful.' 

'All of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it to continue its life-changing and life-saving work. So it goes from a foundation at a university to another foundation,' Clinton said during an interview with ABC News when asked about the criticism she and her husband have faced recently for their wealth.

Clinton defended her fee by saying that her speaking engagements are used to present 'new ideas to help strengthen the economy, which in turn, will help lower income inequality.'

'It’s been my experience,' Clinton said, 'That they’re not worried about my speaking or my household, they’re worried about their own. And that’s the kind of debate I think I’m furthering as I go around the country speaking.'
