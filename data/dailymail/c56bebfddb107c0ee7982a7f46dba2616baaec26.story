Dr Louise Richardson said she was 
taunted by members of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club after being 
refused an honorary membership

The head of Scotland’s oldest university has revealed how she was taunted by members of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club after being refused an honorary membership.

Louise Richardson, principal at St Andrews, said club ties were waved in her face following the snub.

The R&A, which has 2,400 male members worldwide, will vote on September 18 on whether or not to admit women.

It will require a two-thirds majority to change the rules of the 260-year-old club.

Last year, a political storm erupted when the Open was held at men-only club Muirfield, near Edinburgh. Alex Salmond pledged not to attend amid an international outcry.

Dr Richardson was drawn into the same storm when it emerged she would not receive the customary invite to join that is extended to St Andrews University principals.

Now the Irish-American academic, a world expert on terrorism, said in a US interview that club members had waved their ties in the club colours, in her face.

She added: ‘To draw my attention, lest I didn’t notice. They think that’s funny.

‘Once or twice, female professors have seen me in situations where I’m surrounded by men wearing their R&A ties, and they get really upset and offended for me.’

Dr Richardson’s two predecessors were automatically offered honorary membership of the club, on taking office.

But despite the intervention of First Minister Alex Salmond, the R&A would not overturn its ban.

The 56-year-old political scientist told the New York Times: ‘I, being kind of a professional and a pragmatist, said, “Oh, we can work something out; this is silly”. But little did I know.

‘The last thing I want to do is sound 
strident about this because on my list of concerns, it’s not high up 
there, and yet it’s tough when you think about it.’

The R&A, which is also the governing body of the sport around the world, will vote on September 18 whether to admit women.

The R&A, which has 2,400 male members, will vote on whether or not to admit women later this year

It will require a two-thirds majority to change the rules of the 260-year-old club.

Dr Richardson said the men-only policy had caused problems since her appointment in 2009 by making it impossible for her to meet potential donors face-to-face on the R&A’s turf.

She added: ‘A supporter of the university asked if he could have lunch at the R&A today. I had to arrange for somebody I know to take him because I can’t.

‘And I had to arrange for another member of the staff to take his wife to lunch some place in town because she can’t get into the R&A, either.’

The principal said she had occasionally been invited into the clubhouse but had refused.

She added: ‘Once a month wives that are well-behaved are invited to a lunch. But I’ve said, “I’m not eating in the clubhouse until women can enter”.’
