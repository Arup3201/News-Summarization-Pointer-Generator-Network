A University of Montana student who disappeared over the weekend during a fishing trip was found alive on Tuesday near the state's border with Idaho where his sport utility vehicle had broken down, authorities said.

Dozens of law enforcement officials and volunteers had been scouring the winding canyons and trout streams of the Bitterroot Valley in western Montana in a search for August Kramer, 21, after he failed to return to the Missoula campus as planned on Sunday. 

Safe and sound: August Kramer, left, was lost for two days in the Montana wilderness 

Resourceful: Kramer has said that he boiled water and that he put CDs on the top of his car so that the reflection would get attention overhead

Kramer, who grew up in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota, was driving on Sunday on a dirt road toward Idaho from Montana to go fly fishing when his vehicle broke down, stranding him for two nights in temperatures that dipped below freezing, said Paige Pavalone, spokeswoman for the Missoula County Sheriff’s Office.

Kramer revealed to NBC Montana, 'At first there was a little bit of panic where just, you know, it's just like "Okay this is happening, I need to figure out what I am going to do next."'

To survive, Kramer also said he 'cut the top off the beer can and dumped it out and then I would go down to the stream a half mile away and then bring back water and then boil it so that it would be sanitary.'

He also told NBC Montana that he 'taped a bunch of CDs upside-down to the roof of my car to try to make it more reflective, and I had my fire going all the time and a bunch of green tree branches that I was going to throw on the fire to signal aircraft or maybe a helicopter or something.'

Kramer, a senior majoring in forestry, was spotted on Tuesday by an unidentified driver who picked him up. He has since returned to Missoula, Pavalone said.

Flavor: Though he was stuck, Kramer has said he 'loved' eating a grasshopper

Danger: Kramer was driving on Sunday on a dirt road toward Idaho from Montana to go fly fishing when his vehicle broke down

Kramer told ABC News he 'loved' eating a grasshopper.

'There wasn’t a ton of taste, but it reminded me a little bit like popcorn,' he said. 'But not quite.'

Speaking of his experience, Kramer told the news site 'When I was younger, I read a lot of survival books and some of it stuck.

William Souder, who says on Facebook he is Kramer's uncle, wrote yesterday in on the page for group 'Searching for August Kramer' that 'Gus's family back in Minnesota is gathering tonight to celebrate Gus's safe return, while Gus is with his parents and his uncle in Missoula.

'We are, of course, ecstatic. The only thing that could make it better is if all of you were here with us. Thank you again everyone in Montana and elsewhere who did so much to help a family you don't even know. We owe the world a good deed.'

Kramer was the second University of Montana student to go missing in recent weeks.

The body of Lucius Robbi, 21, of California was found late last month in the mountains of central Idaho after disappearing on Aug. 19 while driving to the Missoula campus.

Authorities said Robbi died from blunt force trauma the same day he disappeared after his car plunged down a 60-foot embankment in an accident being investigated by the Idaho State Police.
