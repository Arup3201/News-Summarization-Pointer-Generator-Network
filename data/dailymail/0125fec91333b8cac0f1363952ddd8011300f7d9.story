In trouble: Brodie Normans's parents had agreed the 16-year-old could stay at home and ask some friends around for an evening in

The formula is familiar. Parents out, plus teenager at home, multiplied by friends alerted to a party opportunity via social media...equals Big Trouble.

But while Brodie Norman’s parents have forgiven her for wrecking their family home when a party advertised on Twitter and Facebook turned into a riot, it seems the 16-year-old hostess herself is less than contrite.

Hours after 100 teenagers caused £4,000 damage at the party, Brodie was back on Twitter, proclaiming: ‘My house has about fallen apart haha.’

Then alongside a picture of damage to the garden, she wrote: ‘So after last nights party i now owe my mum n dad about 4 grand for the damage.. Wikid.’

Her parents Kevin and Lesley, however, certainly weren’t seeing the funny side of  their daughter’s little get-together on Easter Sunday night.

Mrs Norman, 43, was working at  a pub and her husband, 45, a flooring contractor, was away for the Easter weekend with their 12-year-old son Jed when they agreed  Brodie could ask some friends round for pizza.

They didn’t, however, account for the invitation being sent – with full address and postcode –  to hundreds of people on Twitter and Facebook.

Their £350,000 detached family home in Enderby, Leicestershire, was trashed as dozen of teenagers poured through the doors.

Bedrooms were ransacked, possessions hurled from windows, wardrobes emptied and ornaments smashed. Cooking oil, chilli sauce, mustard and flour were smeared about the house and teenagers danced on the roof.

Carnage: Lesley Norman, 43, returned home to find her house trashed when up to 100 youths gatecrashed a small house party held by her 16-year-old daughter, Brodie, which was advertised on Twitter

Trashed: A picture posted on Twitter shows debris and broken furniture strewn across the garden

Damage: The ruined garden of Kevin and Lesley Norman's detached family home in Enderby, Leicestershire

Wrecked: Cooking oil, chilli sauce, mustard and flour were strewn throughout the £350,000 home and, inspired by a U.S. cult film about an anarchic house party, teenagers were seen dancing on the roof

The Normans, who have lived in the 
house for 11 years, have grounded Brodie and labelled  Twitter ‘the 
devil’.  The party spiralled out of control after a friend of a friend 
posted the address on Twitter and Facebook, along with the message: 
‘BRING WHOEVER!’

Response: Brodie appears unrepentant, returning to the site hours after the carnage to write: 'My house has about fallen apart haha'

For three hours partygoers replicated the 2012 cult US movie Project X, in which a house party turns into a riot.

Mrs Norman arrived home at around 1am on Easter Monday.

‘I was too shocked to say anything 
when I walked in,’ she said. ‘My whole body was shaking, but I couldn’t 
even cry.

'It looked like a bomb had hit the house. Everything was 
obliterated. Every  glass and cup had been emptied from the kitchen 
cupboards  and smashed.

'Someone had put their fist through two original
doors that had been here since  the house was built in 1927.

‘Brodie and her friends were on their 
hands and knees, doing their best to clean up the mess.

'They stayed 
until 4.30am but the place was a mess days later. We’re still finding 
damage.’

Brodie, a trainee hairdresser, has 
offered to pay £100 a week from her wages towards the damages.

But she 
has also boasted on Twitter that it was night to remember.

‘BritishProjectX #DancingOnRoof #SickNight,’ she wrote.

Her mother, perhaps unaware  of the 
post-party tweets, said:  ‘Brodie couldn’t have been more sorry. It 
slowly dawned on me that it wasn’t really her fault.

'It was this rogue
idiot that tweeted that a party was taking place.  In my view Twitter 
is the devil. Youngsters need educating  about how harmful social 
networking can be.’
