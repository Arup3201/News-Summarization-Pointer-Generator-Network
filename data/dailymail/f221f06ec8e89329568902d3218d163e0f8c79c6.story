An auction ended Friday with no bids for the New Hampshire compound of a tax-evading couple convicted of amassing an arsenal of weapons and holding federal law enforcement officials at bay for months.

The auction of Ed and Elaine Brown's fortress-like home on 100 acres in Plainfield was held at U.S. District Court in Concord. The minimum required bid was $250,000. Elaine Brown's dental office in Lebanon also was being auctioned but got no bids

Prospective bidders have not been allowed to tour the property, and last year, the U.S. Marshals Service cited the possibility of land mines and other explosives buried on the property as a complication.

Buyers beware: The home of Ed and Elaine Brown in Plainfield, New Hampshire, is up for sale for a minimum bid of $250,000 after the couple went to prison for tax evasion. The property may still have land mines

The court has ruled that the Browns and any heirs have no claims to the properties or any assets from their sale.

If the properties sell, the first entities to be paid would be the municipalities of Plainfield and Lebanon, which are owed back property taxes.

The Browns, who do not recognize the federal government's authority to tax its citizens, had a nine-month standoff with authorities in 2007 after they were sentenced to five years in prison for tax evasion.

Ed Brown was affiliated with the Constitution Defense Militia, an organization against taxation and that believes there could be a federal takeover of private property, the New Hampshire Sunday News reported.

He named as part of this alleged conspiracy presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush, Soviet Union's last leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, the United Nations, among others.

During the 2007 standoff, he was prepared with guns, ammunition and 18 months worth of food stockpiled in his basement.

He said the militia would react violently and there would be 'blood in the streets' if the government tried to take over his guns, according to the New Hampshire Sunday News.

While the Browns kept federal marshals
 at bay during the standoff, they welcomed a parade of anti-tax and anti-government 
supporters.

One such visitor was Randy Weaver, whose wife and son were killed along 
with a deputy U.S. marshal in a 1992 shootout on Weaver's property in 
Ruby Ridge, Idaho.

The couple was arrested peacefully when U.S. marshals posed as supporters and were able to get inside.

They were convicted in 2009 of amassing weapons, explosives and booby traps and plotting to kill federal agents who came to arrest them.

Ed and Elaine Brown, both in their 70s, are serving 37 and 35 years in prison.

As of a year ago, numerous federal agencies with explosive detection equipment and dogs still couldn't ensure the land was free of booby traps.

But the hilltop house and the grounds up to the tree line have been searched extensively and have deemed free of improvised explosive devices and other booby traps.
