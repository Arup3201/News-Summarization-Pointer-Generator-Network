The UKIP politician under fire for referring to ‘Bongo Bongo land’ today offered up yet another explanation for his remarks – he was talking about an antelope.

Godfrey Bloom faced repeated accusations of racism after condemning foreign aid being sent to ‘Bongo Bongo land’, seen as a derogatory reference to Africa.

But he insisted that a bongo is a ‘white antelope, lives in the forest, there is no connotation of racism about it whatsoever’.

Critics were quick to point out that the bongo antelope is not white, it is brown.

Excuses: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom insisted a 'bongo' is an antelope, so 'Bongo Bongo Land' is the home of the antelope, not a racist term

The bizarre justification for his remarks is just the latest in a long list put forward by the MEP since a recording of a speech to UKIP activists emerged this week.

He was slapped on the wrist by party leaders after he was secretly recorded making what critics immediately branded racist comments.

He told supporters in the Midlands that foreign leaders who received aid spent the money on ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris, Ferraris and all the rest of it’.

In the recording, the MEP for Yorkshire 
and the Humber says: ‘How we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a 
month when we’re in this sort of debt to Bongo Bongo land is completely 
beyond me.’

UKIP leader Nigel Farage ordered Mr Bloom to stop using the term and the under-fire MEP issued a carefully-worded statement apologising if he had caused ‘genuine offence’.

However, in a fresh round of media interviews he again sought to explain his choice of words.

He told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘These have been interpreted as racist comments, they are not racist at all.

‘If anybody would care to take the trouble to get out the Oxford dictionary this morning and look it up, you’ll find that bongo is a white antelope, lives in the forest, there is no connotation of racism about it whatsoever.

‘Bongo land is the land of the antelope.

‘Some people have interpreted it as a racist remark but there is no evidence in any dictionary at all that it implies racism.’

There is just a few dozen of the bongo antelopes left in Kenya.

They are hunted for their reddish-brown coat with white stripes, and their long spiralled horns.

There are thought to be only around 100 left in the wild.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the the western or lowland bongo on the ‘near threatened’ list.

In addition to the threat posed by poachers, numbers of fallen as logging wiped out their habitats.

But his explanation was dismissed by Labour's foreign aid spokesman Rushanara Ali. She said: 'It’s offensive for sure and the public 
have shown that they find it offensive so I think Mr Bloom should 
apologise, it would do him good, it would do his party good.

'This is a 
party that is trying to show that they are reasonable but his comments 
are completely unacceptable and objectionable and that’s what the public
are saying.

'Nigel
Farage ought to step in and sort this out because this just shows what 
his party is really about and it’s not a party that’s inclusive, it’s an
intolerant party and it’s defined by Mr Bloom.

'There
are legitimate views about how we should spend aid and so on but I 
don’t think the vast majority of people accept the term bongo bongo land
- that is offensive.'

The 63-year-old has spent the last 24 hours fielding questions about the comments, insisting he has the broad support of the public away from the ‘Westminster bubble’.

His office has revealed 3,000 emails since the storm erupted and ‘half a dozen’ disagree with him, he claimed.

Repeatedly quizzed on whether he is a
racist, Mr Bloom told Channel 4 News interviewer Krishnan Guru-Murthy: 
‘Move on, there’s a good fellow. If you’re not going to move on to 
serious issues, I’m not going to continue – I can’t be bothered with 
it.’

He then tore off his earpiece and stormed off.

It
was an abrupt ending to a day of Whitehall farce as Mr Bloom engaged in
a whirlwind tour of radio and television studios, repeatedly defending 
himself and making the case against overseas aid.

Asked by the BBC yesterday where ‘Bongo Bongo land’ was, Mr Bloom said: ‘I don’t know where Ruritania is either – there is no such place of course is there? Like the Third World. Where is the Third World?’

Later he suggested: ‘It might have been misconstrued by President Bongo of the Gambon, he may have thought I was talking about him.

‘If he is offended, I shall write to his excellency in short order and say, “I’m very sorry I wasn’t talking about you”.

Ali Bongo is president of Gabon, not Gambon.

David Cameron weighed into the row today, branding Mr Bloom's remarks 'offensive' and defending the use of British taxpayers' money for overseas aid.

He said: 'I think it is an offensive remark anyway, but what I think is wrong is this sort of "stop the world, I want to get off" approach just doesn't work.

'Britain is a very open international country. The problems elsewhere come and visit us. So it makes sense I think to have an overseas aid programme that helps solve these problems at source,' he told BBC Breakfast.

However, Mr Bloom stood by his central argument that it was wrong to send British taxpayers’ money to foreign countries while making cuts at home.

He claimed: ‘We’re closing our A&E wings of our hospitals, we’re cutting our police, we’re cutting our defence, we don’t have enough dialysis machines and we're sending £1 billion a month away without even an audit trail.

‘We don’t even know where most of it goes. It’s treason and it’s a disgrace and that’s the point I made in my speech which incidentally wasn’t clandestine recorded, it was an open meeting in Birmingham and lots of people were there - there was nothing clandestine about it.”

Asked if he has been pressured to resign by the UKIP leadership, Mr Bloom replied: 'Good Lord no, not with the amount of support that I’ve had - it’s massive.

'What I have promised Nigel is I won’t use that phraseology in the future so it can’t be misinterpreted and I’m quite happy to obey that rule.'

The
son of a Second World War fighter pilot, Mr Bloom – known to friends as
‘Godders’ – grew up in London and spent 40 years working as an 
economist in the City.

He has been married to Katryna, a 
physiotherapist who hails from Poland, for nearly 30 years. Mr Bloom 
drifted into politics after being asked to write a research note on the 
single currency in the mid-1990s.

‘I gave it ten years before it started to inwardly collapse,’ he recalls. ‘I’ve been proved right in spades.’

Mr Farage, then a City colleague and drinking companion, persuaded him to join the party. He was elected as an MEP in 2004.

Men are from Mars and women are from Venus.

Or in Godfrey Bloom's case, men are better at reversing cars while women can find condiments in the pantry and fret about wet towels left on beds.

The bowler-hat wearing 63-year-old as gained a reputation for his outspoken views.

His latest musings on the differences between the sexes emerged in an article railing against setting quotes for the number of women on the boards of FTSE 100 companies.

Mr Bloom argued that women have a 'genetic predisposition' to prioritise family over working hard.

'Most women can find the mustard in the pantry quicker than a man, most men can reverse a car better than a woman,' he said in an article.

'Men and women care about different things on a micro-scale. Leaving the lavatory seat up, wet towels on the bed and the top left off the toothpaste will drive a wife mad.

'A man simply cannot understand what the problem is. Most wives do not regard putting petrol in the car as any part of their responsibility.

'Men cannot see the point in making the bed if you are going to get back in it tonight.'

He also boasted of being 'just about as Alpha' as a man can be.

'I am not a 'new man', would not be caught dead at the birth of a baby and [would be] happy to punch the first man who tries to steal my beer,' he said in the article last month.

He also lashed out at modern feminism 'spawned in the bra burning 1970s by rather shrill, bored, middleclass women of a certain physical genre'.

He said they represented few women but are now supported by 'the slightly effete politically correct chaps who get sand kicked in their face on the beach'.
