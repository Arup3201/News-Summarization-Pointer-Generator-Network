It sounds like a plot lifted from a sci-fi disaster movie.

A Russian scientist has said a Soviet-era ballistic missile system dubbed 'Satan' should be put back into use defending the earth from asteroids.

Senior rocket researcher Sabit Saitgarayev - who spoke out after a meteor burst over Russia's Ural Mountains earlier this year damaging thousands of buildings - said the old 1960s missiles were ideally suited to destroying any potential threats streaking towards the planet from space.

Back in use? The scientist suggested the old Soviet-era SS9 ICBM missiles should be put back to work protecting the earth from meteorites

Threat: The researcher said the missiles - named Satan by NATO - were well suited to 'fighting suddenly discovered small [space] objects'

Powerful: The meteor left a 50-foot hole in the frozen surface of a lake as it crashed down in Russia's Chelyabinsk region

Mr Saitgarayev, from the State Rocket Design Center, highlighted the havoc caused when the meteor burst over the Urals on February 15, leaving around 1,200 people injured.

It created a sonic boom that shattered windows and damaged thousands of buildings around the city of Chelyabinsk.

'Well-suited': The Soviet-era missiles could intercept a falling missile with a mere 20 minutes' warning, Mr Saitgarayev claimed

The researcher said the missiles, which use standard liquid fuel based on hydrazine, were 'well-suited' to fighting 'suddenly discovered small [space] objects, according to a report on news.com.au.

He pointed out that the missiles could be kept poised and ready to launch for up to a decade.

It means a missile could be launched against an approaching asteroid with a mere 20 minutes warning, in contrast to modern missile systems, which require several days of preparation ahead of a launch.

Hurtling from space: The missiles could intercept a meteorite like the one that streaked across the sky over Chelyabinsk in February before it crashed into the earth, the scientist has claimed

Defence: The scientist referred to the meteor that streaked across the skies over Russia's Ural Mountains earlier this year, causing sharp explosions

Damage: The exploding meteorite left the roof of this zinc factory in Russia's Chelyabinsk region in ruins

Scientists claimed the meteorite that exploded over the Urals was the biggest space rock to hit earth in more than a century.

The enormous meteorite weighed an estimated 100,000 tons and measured around 55ft in diameter.

Mr Saitgarayev claimed Satan missiles would be capable of destroying objects with a diameter of up to around 300ft. If equipped with a booster, the 1960s missile would be able to destroy a space object hurtling towards earth while it was still five to six hours away, he said.

Satan missiles can be used for destroying small space objects with a diameter of up to 100 meters threatening the Earth, if the missile is equipped with the third stage. If reequipped with a booster, the missile will be able to destroy space objects five-six hours before their collision with the Earth, he said.
