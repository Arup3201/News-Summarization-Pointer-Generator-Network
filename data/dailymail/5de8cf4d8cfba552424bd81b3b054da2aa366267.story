Johnny Kock, 68, tried to import £1b of cocaine hidden in boxes of washing powder 

A drugs kingpin who tried to import an estimated£1billion of cocaine hidden in boxes of washing powder has been jailed for 25 years.

Johnny Kock, 68, posed as a respectable businessman in his huge European operation to 'flood the streets' with cocaine.

Kock, from Wavertree, Merseyside, used a pond liner company as cover to ship in vast amounts of cocaine in boxes of washing powder. 

Millions of pounds of drugs were found in a single consignment but a further 57 shippings had already taken place, leading experts to believe he was responsible for £1bn worth of drugs being brought into Britain. 

Sentencing him to 25 years behind bars at Liverpool Crown Court yesterday, Judge Mark Brown said: 'In terms of the amounts of cocaine, this must be one of the biggest ever offences considered by the courts.' 

Grey-haired Kock was arrested last October when police discovered cocaine worth £26m and 110,000 Euros in two separate seizures in the German city of Bremen and the Channel Tunnel town of Coquelles, in northern France. 

At the time of the bust, 125kg of cocaine was said to be destined for a warehouse within the Knowsley Industrial Park complex, in Kirkby, Liverpool. 

Police also found £4,570 in his van and £7,170 at the home he shared with partner Deborah Fagan in Wavertree – said to be money obtained through his drug importing business.

The court was told that the seized shipments were just two out of 57 shipments known to have been delivered to Kock's business Aquaries Pondliner Ltd, based in the Old Swan area of Liverpool.

Judge Brown said the amount of cocaine brought in by Koch was between one and six tonnes. 

The National Crime Agency said that if 6,000 kilos of cocaine was imported, it would be potentially worth £960m on the streets.

Kock pleaded guilty to conspiracy to evade the prohibition on the importation of class A drugs, concealing criminal property and two counts of possession of criminal property.

He later tried to change his plea on the drug case to not guilty, claiming he thought he was moving cannabis and never opened the packages.

That bid failed following a two-day court hearing this week.

Alex Leach, prosecuting, said the value of the recovered drugs alone was an estimated £26m, never mind the other shipments that got through.

He told the court: 'The prosecution case is that each of the 57 loads contained somewhere between 23 and 107 kilos of cocaine.

'It's at the very highest level of drug importation into this country. The scope of this conspiracy stretches far beyond the two loads that were recovered.'

Judge Brown went further, saying: 'This really is the top end of the scale is it not? When you are in the order of six tonnes, and high purity at that? 

'It was in my opinion a relatively simple but audacious way of getting class A drugs into the UK.

'Whilst it isn't possible for the prosecution to determine precisely the weight of cocaine you imported it was obviously a vast amount, at least between 1,300kg and 6,000kg, worth many, many millions of pounds.

'Also this was high purity cocaine that no doubt would have been cut up for street dealing.

'This case highlights the ease with which vast amounts of cocaine can be imported into this country.

'You must have known you were playing for high stakes both in financial reward and the consequences if discovered.

'I'm satisfied that was a risk you were willing to take therefore it follows there must be a very substantial term of imprisonment.'

Judge Brown also congratulated the officers who brought Kock to justice, saying they had closed down a significant avenue to drugs, which he called a 'cancer on society', to enter the UK.

Kock's partner Fagan, was jailed for 12 months in April after admitting charges related to the drugs money.
