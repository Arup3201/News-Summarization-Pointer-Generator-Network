A couple who claimed they were too ill to cook their own meals were actually running a cafe while illegally pocketing £135,000 in benefits.

Caroline Banks and Karl Bradsell both worked at Riscatti's Cafe in Bury, despite claiming they could not cook for themselves and that one of them struggled to walk.

The pair pleaded guilty to 24 charges of fraud, with Banks, of Hills Court, Bury, jailed for 16 months and Bradsell, of Chaffinch Drive, Bury, for 19 months.

Caroline Banks and Karl Bradsell both worked at Riscatti's Cafe in Bury, despite claiming they could not cook for themselves 

After a tip-off, council officers and the Department for Work and Pensions launched an investigation, catching the couple out using CCTV and secretly-recorded footage.

The pair, who are no longer together, amassed a total of £135,000 over five years of deceitful benefits claims.

They both claimed that they could not cook - but in reality the pair ran a cafe and Bradsell used a mobility car to deliver Chinese takeaways.

Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, told Bolton Crown Court that Banks, 42, said she was unable to walk unaided, needed a wheelchair and required help using the toilet.

She claimed to have a long list of illnesses, including a slipped disc in her back, angina and depression.

Her home was adapted with a stairlift and a wet room while she was claiming Disability Living Allowance, Employment Support and Housing Benefit, among others. She also had a mobility car so friends and family could drive her around.

But Banks, who sobbed throughout the hearing, was filmed working long days on her feet, lifting tables and chairs and serving customers at the cafe. On one occasion, she was even spotted wearing high heels.

Defending Banks, Stuart Duke said her initial benefit claims had been legitimate, but that the situation spiralled into 'dishonesty and deceit'. 

Sentencing at Bolton Crown Court, Judge Elliot Knopf said the pair's crimes were a 'slap in the face to the taxpayer' and those 'genuinely and honestly entitled to benefits' (file picture)

She was overpaid £62,000 and will pay back the cash from her benefits.

Mr Duke said: 'Ironically, since these offences came to light, both her physical and mental health have deteriorated. She has fallen into abject poverty and is unable to walk.' 

Bradsell, also 42, said he rented the council house next door to Banks and was single, but in reality he lived with Banks in her adapted home while he sub-let his house to his brother.

When questioned in 2012, he claimed to suffer from epilepsy and depression and said he hadn't worked in seven years.

Bradsell said his condition was so bad that he had fits every couple of days and suffered panic attacks, often wetting himself.

He said he couldn't drive because of his epilepsy and that he used a microwave because he was afraid of using the cooker.

But he was filmed driving Banks' mobility car to and from the cafe, where he cooked and cleaned, and even used the vehicle to deliver food for a Chinese takeaway at night.

Defending Bradsell, Michael Lea said he accepted he had exaggerated his condition when claiming benefits. 

Bradsell now has a job helping older people and is paying back around £140 a week out of his wages to refund the £73,000 he fraudulently claimed.

Sentencing, Judge Elliot Knopf said the pair's crimes were a 'slap in the face to the taxpayer' and those 'genuinely and honestly entitled to benefits'.

He added: 'You put your heads together and agreed to consciously, deliberately and persistently defraud the system. You painted a completely and utterly false picture of your conditions - you knew the buttons to press.'

After the hearing, Bury councillor Sandra Walmsley said: 'This was a deliberate and breathtaking act of fraud, carried out over a long time and involving huge sums of money.

'Thanks to the determined efforts of our investigators, Bradsell and Banks have finally been brought to justice.'
