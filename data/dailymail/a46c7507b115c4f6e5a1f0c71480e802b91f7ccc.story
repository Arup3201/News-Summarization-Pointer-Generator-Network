Shooter: Suspected gunman Arthur Douglas Harmon, 70, is accused of firing shots inside an office building

The gunman who allegedly opened fire in a Phoenix office building has been identified as 70-year-old William Arthur Harmon III, and he is still at large.

Authorities said that they are trying to track down Harmon, who is still considered ‘armed and dangerous.’

Documents show that Harmon was slated to go into a law office in the same building on Wednesday over a contract dispute and had a shaky history with business CEO Steve Singer, 48, who he allegedly killed.

While Phoenix police did not immediately release the names of those wounded, law firm Osborn Maledon said one of their lawyers, Mark Hummels, was wounded, and was ‘representing a client in a mediation’ when he was shot.

The third victim, a 32-year-old woman, suffered non-life threatening injuries.

Police Sgt Tommy Thompson said that the two men were intentionally targeted by the shooter. ‘It was not a random shooting,’ he told the Associated Press.

Attorney David Panzarella, who dealt with Harmon five years ago over a separate legal dispute, said that Harmon had been involved in at least 10 civil suits.

‘He’s litigious and has sued a lot of people,’ he told My Fox Phoenix.

According to court documents, Singer was CEO of Fusion Contact Centers LLC. They had hired Harmon to refurbish cubicles within the Scottsdale, Arizona office.

Fusion Contact Centers said that they paid Harmon $30,000 of the $47,000 drawn out in the contract, but asked Harmon to pay back a majority of his fee as the cubicles could not be refurnished due to a mix-up.

Public records show that Harmon is married to Ivett Veronica Huska, and has a son, Timothy G. Harmon. Police were interviewing both of them Wednesday over Harmon’s whereabouts and possible motives.

Mr Panzarella, who represented a man who was being sued by Harmon for causing a fender bender, added that Harmon had ‘obvious anger issues’ and was consistently ‘rude and disrespectful.’

Witnesses reported hearing multiple shots around 10.30am and said there was significant amounts of blood in the lobby area of the office building.

Phoenix police Sgt Tommy Thompson said a suspect went into the office building and shot several people.The suspect then fled the building.

A number of other people have been taken to nearby hospitals for stress-related injuries.

Police do not think it was a random act but that the shooter went to the office with the gun, got into an altercation with someone and started shooting.

Colin Campbell, a Phoenix lawyer, said his law firm partner was one of those shot.

The victim, in his 30s, was shot in his neck and lower back, according to Campbell.

The partner went through surgery for his wounds and 'is going to be OK',
Campbell said. He wouldn't identify his friend or the law firm until he
had time to talk with the victim's family.

The shooting took place soon after 
former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords appeared before the 
Senate Judiciary Committee to deliver a statement on the need for more 
gun control.

The
former Congresswoman read slowly from a sheet of paper, leaning on 
words for emphasis, as she said that too many children are dying and 
that the time to act against gun violence is now.

The face of the issue: Former Arizona Democrat 
Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot at point-blank range in 2011, spoke 
slowly but determinedly at the Senate Committee on gun violence today in
D.C.

The Arizona Democrat, who survived being shot at point-blank range in 2011, made her short remarks to the packed room on Capitol Hill as her husband, retired astronaut Captain Mark Kelly, urged her on with reassuring nods.

Captain Mark Kelly, husband of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, took a moment during a long and contentious gun violence hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee to break news of yet another shooting in his home state of Arizona.

The shooting comes amidst a heated debate on gun control, and comes nearly two months after the fatal shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
