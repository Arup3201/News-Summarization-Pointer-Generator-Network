Great Britain's Hannah Cockroft was delighted after she broke her own world record with a stunning performance in the 200m T34 race on the opening day of the IPC Athletics Grand Prix in Nottwil, Switzerland.

The 21-year-old multi-world and Paralympic champion powered past her previous best time by 0.37 seconds as she came home in 30.86secs to beat a strong field that included six of the eight finalists at the London 2012 Games.

Cockfroft, from Halifax, said: 'It was great to post such a fast time in my first IPC Athletics Grand Prix of the season. I'm delighted with the record, although I know I can go faster looking at my training times.

Record breaker: Cockroft beat her own world record by a margine of 0.37 seconds

Golden girl: The sprinter won Gold in both the 100m and 200m at London 2012

'This shows I'm in great form ahead of August's European Championships when hopefully I can lower the record again.'

In the men's 10,000 metres T54 David Weir marked his comeback as he came home second following a sprint finish.

The 34-year-old Great Britain Paralympic champion lost out on first place after going head-to-head with home favourite Marcel Hug, who finished in 21 minutes, 16.21 seconds in the first leg of the season.

Midway through the race, rivals Weir and Hug broke away from the rest of the field with Masayuki Higuchi of Japan, but with 200m to go, the Swiss powered to the front and crossed the finish line first with Weir just 0.10secs further back.

Return: David Weir narrowly missed out on the win in the 10,000m but will be pleased with his performance

Weir, who has won a total of six gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Paralympic Games, and has won the London Marathon on six occasions, said: 'It was a good race. I don't do many 10,000m so it was nice to feel comfortable throughout the race.

'I wanted a British record but there were only three of us out there doing the work. But it was a good race. It felt like the old days with each of us taking it in turns leading the laps.'

On Saturday, Hug and Weir line-up against each other again twice - first in the 800m during the morning session and in the eagerly anticipated 1,500m race during the evening.
