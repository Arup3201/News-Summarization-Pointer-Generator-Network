Frank Lampard has taken advantage of the international break to watch his next club New York City FC in action at the weekend.

Lampard touched down at JFK airport with fiancee Christine Bleakley to watch his parent club take on Sporting Kansas at the Yankee Stadium on Saturday night.

The 36-year-old signed for the start-up MLS side in the summer but joined Manchester City on loan to remain in the Premier League for one more season.

'I have not yet spoken to him about his coming over, but I'm certain we'll get to spend some time together,' New York City FC coach Jason Kreis said  on Wednesday. 

'It's really exciting, obviously, that he's going to take that time and make the effort to come over and see us this weekend when he has a break. We'll look forward to spending some time with him and also getting him around the guys some more. I think that's important.'

Lampard signed with New York City FC in July 2014 and was expected to join the MLS outfit in January after completing the six-month stint in Manchester.

However the former Chelsea talisman has thrived at the Etihad, extending his stay until the end of the season, and will start his tenure in the Big Apple this July.
