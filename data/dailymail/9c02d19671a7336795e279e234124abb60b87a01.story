A mentally ill man admitted today to terrorising Ivanka Trump with a barrage of creepy emails, tweets and online videos along with threatening to commit suicide in her Manhattan jewellery store.

Justin Massler, who for months had been deemed psychologically unfit for trial, pleaded guilty to aggravated harassment and criminal contempt charges.

He was sentenced at a Manhattan court to six months in prison which he has already served, plus five years of probation, during which 
he must continue psychiatric treatment and medication.

Massler, from Reno, Nevada, had become fixated with Ms Trump, the daughter of tycoon Donald Trump and his ex-wife Ivana, saying in his dream life he wanted to marry her.

Prosecutors said that his remarks had become ominous after he threatened to commit suicide in the model and businesswoman's store.

During his two-year obsession, Massler also said he wanted to 'talk some sense into' her husband, 
Jared Kushner and 'commandeer' the New York Observer which Mr Kushner publishes.

According to the Manhattan district attorney's office, Massler wrote an email to the newspaper in August saying: 'I won't be ignored.'

Massler, 29, also said he would die before being caught and 'would go down in a hail of gunfire'.

He posted bizarre YouTube clips in which he insisted aliens were forcing him to continue stalking the successful entrepreneur, according to the New York Post.

Even after his arrest and a court order to stay away from Ivanka Trump, star of Celebrity Apprentice, and her family, Massler continued to try to contact them.

Massler, who had his name legally changed to Cloud Starchaser and told authorities his address was 'a volcano in Hawaii', is schizophrenic and has a history of psychiatric hospitalizations, said his lawyer George Vomvolakis.

Massler was declared unfit to participate in court proceedings eight months ago but doctors concluded last month that his mental state had improved enough under medication for him to return to court.

His lawyer said: 'When he's on his medication, he's fine. He's lucid, he's reasonable.'

Massler also had to sign an order of protection barring him from any contact Ivanka Trump and her husband, along with father Donald and her siblings.

Representatives for Ms Trump had no immediate comment.

Ivanka Trump, who attended Georgetown University before going on to business school, is vice-president at her father's real estate company along with having her own jewellery, handbag and clothing lines. She married Jared Kushner in 2009 and last year had the couple's first child, a daughter named Arabella Rose.
