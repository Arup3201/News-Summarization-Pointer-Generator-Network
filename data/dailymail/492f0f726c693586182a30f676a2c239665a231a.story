Fancy a stroll between two of the highest points in the Swiss Alps?

The world's first suspension bridge between mountain peaks is about to make this panoramic dream a reality.

The bridge, suspended 9,700ft in the air, will also have a partial glass floor to allow visitors a once in a lifetime view of the 6,500ft drop between the Glacier 3000 and Scex Rouge.

Peak Walk, as it will be known, will also boast stunning views of the distant Mont Blanc and Eiger mountains.

Scheduled to open this November, the bridge will be able to hold 300 visitors for any given walk, but will limit numbers to 150 to offer tourists the option for a more leisurely stroll.

The bridge will be open year round and has been built to withstand winds of up to 155mph.

Switzerland hopes this new engineering marvel will help to double the amount of visitors to the region each summer, though its construction has gone anything but smoothly.

Bad weather over the summer, as well as struggles faced by workers in the thin mountain-top air, have caused a variety of scheduling difficulties.

Nevertheless, the steel cable for the bridge was brought up to the mountains by helicopter this week. 

The bridge is estimated to cost £1.2million to construct, and while impressive it will actually only be the second highest suspension bridge in the world, with the The Titlis Cliff Walk in Obwalden, Switzerland, taking top honours.
