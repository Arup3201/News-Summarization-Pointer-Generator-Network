Greek police investigating the ‘execution-style’ murder of a 19-year-old say British youths have brought ‘gang warfare’ to the holiday island of Crete.

Tyrell Matthews-Burton was stabbed through the heart during a bar fight involving more than 30 British tourists in the rowdy resort of Malia.

Myles Litchmore-Dunbar, a 19-year-old model and university student, has been charged with murder and possession of a weapon.

Litchmore-Dunbar, from Catford, South-East London, is believed to have been detained after leaving the scene on a quad bike. Another Briton has allegedly confessed to being involved in the killing and more than a dozen have appeared in court following the brawl.

Police on Crete have attributed the murder in the early hours of Tuesday to gang violence imported from the streets of London.

Yannis Phillipakis, an officer in Heraklion, the island’s capital, said: ‘They had scores to settle long before they arrived here. What we are hearing is that they brought their gang warfare to Crete.’

It is claimed Mr Matthews- Burton was pinned down on the cobbled street of the Beach Road in Malia and stabbed in the back and chest.

An ambulance arrived but the teenager from Leyton, East London, died on his way to hospital. He was killed on his 19th birthday. Greek coroner Manolis Michalodimitrakis said: ‘He was clearly pinned down and killed execution-style – there were no defence wounds. The knife punctured his lung and heart. He lost almost half of his blood.’

Harry Nye, 18, from Kent, said he witnessed the fight outside the Safari Club in the resort. He said: ‘We saw one guy having his head stamped on and this other lad just fell. I’ve never seen that much blood.’

Malia is a popular holiday destination for young Britons, who flock there to enjoy the beaches and the thriving party scene.

But Greek authorities fear the resort is attracting the wrong sort of tourist and recently launched a campaign to promote responsible and safe behaviour.

Locals say the savage battle may even have been arranged weeks in advance. Shopkeeper Giorgos Xedakis said: ‘They have been telling us someone was going to die.’

Malia mayor Zacharias Doxastakis added: ‘It’s not just this –  we have also had a big problem with rapes.’

But relatives of those who have been arrested claim Greek police simply rounded up everyone who had visited the club that night, irrespective of whether they had been involved or even there at the time of the brawl.

The mother of one of the Britons arrested said: ‘My son didn’t know the man who died, and wasn’t there when it happened – he had left  earlier with some girls. But they arrested him and put him in handcuffs to take him to court.’

Another mother said: ‘My son was privately educated and he is a stockbroker. He had nothing do with it but has been arrested anyway.’

Litchmore-Dunbar is studying towards an economics degree  at Northampton University, according to a profile on a modelling website.

A tourist who met him in Crete said: ‘He didn’t seem like trouble at all. He was very laid-back and relaxed. I don’t believe this is anything to do with gang  violence. I think it was over something really petty.’

The resort of Malia was the setting for 
the 2011 comedy film The Inbetweeners Movie, in which four young men 
went on a ‘lads’ holiday’.

BBC DJ Tim Westwood, who performed in Malia on Monday, tweeted about the death yesterday, calling Tyrell by what is thought to be his nickname, Sterling. He wrote: ‘Saddest nite in Malia. RIP Sterling – deepest sympathies to the family and friends.’

More than 60 of the 250 gangs in London are considered dangerous by the Met Police and commit half of shootings and a fifth of serious violence in the capital.

Relatives of some of those arrested said police had simply rounded up everyone who had visited the club that night

In most areas, gang members carve up the streets according to postcodes, with names such as the Leytonstone Man Dem  and the Catford Wildcat.

Teenage gang members regularly boast about their activities  by posting videos posing with weapons on YouTube.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ‘We can confirm the death of a British national in Malia, Greece, on July 23.

‘We are aware of the arrests of a number of British nationals.

‘We are in touch with the local authorities and stand ready to provide consular assistance.’
