The pancreatic cancer sufferer who sparked outrage  for declaring in an advertising campaign ‘I wish I had breast cancer’ last night insisted: ‘I meant it and still mean it.’

Kerry Harvey, 25, has been hit with hate messages since the provocative advert first appeared, including one from a Twitter user wishing her dead.

Even TV presenter Gloria Hunniford, whose daughter died of breast cancer, denounced the campaign, saying it had made her feel ‘almost sick’.

But Kerry is adamant she had no regrets about appearing in the shock campaign to raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which has far lower survival rates than breast cancer.

She said: ‘I know I upset a lot of people by saying what I did, but it’s true. If I had breast cancer rather than pancreatic cancer, it is almost certain I wouldn’t now be dying. Instead I’ve been told I’ve only got four to five months to live.

‘Hopefully the campaign will lead to more money being spent on research into pancreatic cancer. It won’t help me, but I hope it will mean others will have a better chance than I have.’

Kerry’s comments follow attacks by 
breast cancer campaigners, who say it is ‘utterly misleading’ to suggest
 breast cancer might be a more desirable form of the disease.

But the charity Pancreatic Cancer Action defended its tactics, saying that while 85 per cent of breast cancer patients will survive for at least five years after their diagnosis, that figure falls to just three per cent for pancreatic cancer sufferers.

Kerry, one of three sufferers to appear in the campaign, said: ‘I will never regret saying it publicly. I’m not saying that breast cancer is easier to deal with.

'But I wish I had it because I would have a fighting chance of survival. In the past couple of weeks, cancer lumps have grown on my head and in my breasts so I know I won’t be coming back from this.’

Kerry said she plans to use the time she has left campaigning and is determined to marry her fiance Matt Biggin in May.

Matt, 30, who is now Kerry’s full-time carer, is sickened by vicious jibes at her on Twitter and Facebook. One Twitter  user said they hoped Kerry wouldn’t be in the three per cent of patients who survive.

‘It’s a sick, sad thing to do, but we’re just ignoring it and it won’t make any different to our support for the campaign,’ said Matt. ‘I have always been proud of Kerry and the way she has dealt with her illness. She’s amazing.’

Kerry began suffering from acute stomach pains in November 2012. It took five A&E visits spread over four months before doctors confirmed pancreatic cancer in February last year.

In November, doctors told her to focus 
on palliative care rather than further treatment. She said: ‘I’ve 
received so much support from Pancreatic Cancer Action so I didn’t 
hesitate when they asked me to join the campaign.’

Gloria Hunniford, who set up the Caron Keating Foundation  in memory of her daughter who died in 2004, called the campaign ‘very insensitive’. She said: ‘I feel almost sick when I read the words “I wish I had breast cancer”.

‘I watched my daughter battle breast cancer for seven years. At no time would she have said, ‘‘I’ve have preferred another form of cancer.’’ She didn’t want it at all. You can’t play one cancer against another.’

But Ali Stunt, Pancreatic Cancer 
Action founder and survivor of the disease, defended the campaign, 
admitting she knew it would shock people – although she apologised to 
anyone who had been upset by it.

She
 said: ‘The words that have been used are how genuine people with 
pancreatic cancer feel. It’s about raising awareness for a disease that 
gets  little attention.’

Every day in the UK, 23 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and average life expectancy is less than six months.

A spokeswoman for Pancreatic Cancer Action added: ‘We’re all campaigning for the same cause – to improve everyone’s chance of beating cancer.

'We just have to shout that little bit louder to get heard.

‘We are trying to create a discussion and a debate to make people realise that when faced with a pancreatic cancer diagnosis and a survival rate of only three per cent, it is not unreasonable to wish for a significantly better chance of staying alive.’
