Scotland's traditional whisky distilleries are facing a spirited fight... from England

Scotland’s traditional whisky distilleries are facing a spirited fight... from England.

Sales figures revealed by Marks and Spencer showed the chain’s Fine Single Malt English Whisky out-sold its new Scottish Single Malt by two to one during the Christmas period.

Both bottles have been on sale for £35 - and the impressive performance of the English variety is being hailed as a ‘coup’ for the fledgling industry south of the border.

Distillers believe a growing ‘English movement’ - as the Scots prepare to vote for independence - could have helped boost sales.

M&S’s English Whisky is made by St George’s Distillery, in Roudham, Norfolk, which was set up in 2006 and is currently the only distillery in England - though several others are now being developed.

Andrew Nelstrop, managing director of the English Whisky Company Limited, which runs St George’s Distillery, said he was ‘delighted’ at the sales figures.

‘We weren’t expecting to outsell Scottish whisky. It’s a very nice feeling,’ he said.

‘We produce a range of different whisky types, from the malty to the more heathery varieties. The one we did for M&S is a bespoke single malt with a bit of smoke, which is easy to drink.

‘These kind of sales show people aren’t just buying our whisky as a novelty to see what English whisky tastes like but must be coming back for second bottles - meaning it’s been well-received.’

Mr Nelstrop, a farmer before setting up his distillery, says the business is only ‘tiny’ compared with some of the Scottish distilleries - employing just two production and two office staff.

But he said the industry is a ‘growing sector’.

‘We were the first English distillery for 100 years but a second is just getting going elsewhere, and four more are being developed,’ Mr Nelstrop said.

He added that the Scottish independence referendum may have encouraged some whisky drinkers south of the border to try his product instead.

Emma Dawson, spirits buyer for M&S, said: ‘We are all about innovation and new offerings; an approach which is made possible by the confidence we have in our customers to be adventurous.’
