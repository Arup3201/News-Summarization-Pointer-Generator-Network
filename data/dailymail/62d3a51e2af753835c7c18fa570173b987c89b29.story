A woman who worked at a Connecticut chief medical examiner’s
office was accused of bringing her husband in to gawk at the body of the
Newtown school shooter and has been fired.

Chief Medical Examiner Dr. H. Wayne Carver dismissed the
employee, Jean Henry, in a letter released Friday.

The processing technician, was accused of showing Adam
Lanza's body to her husband on Dec. 16.

Shameful: Jean Henry of the Connecticut medical examiner's office was fired this week for sneaking her husband in to see Adam Lanza's body

Two days earlier, Lanza killed 26 people at Sandy Hook
Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut and then turned a gun on himself.

It was reported in January that Henry was put on
administrative leave pending an investigation into the matter.

At that time, Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy said he
was informed of the investigation, which the University of Connecticut Health
Center conducted as the agency that handles personnel matters for the medical
examiner's office.

‘I hope that was not true. The investigation is ongoing,’
Malloy said. ‘I would be deeply disappointed if proven to be true and would
expect, if proven to be true, that whatever steps are appropriate would be
taken.’

Scene: Henry worked at the facility where Newtown shooter Adam Lanza's body was kept

Outrage: Henry had been on unpaid leave since January, when Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said he hoped it 'was not true'

The Hartford
Courant first broke the story.

Dr. Carver wrote that, in bringing her husband into the
morgue, Henry violated the agency's ethical mission and showed 'extremely
poor judgment.'

A message was left Friday by the AP for Henry at her home in Watertown, Connecticut.

Chris DeFrancesco, a University of Connecticut Health Center
spokesman, says a grievance process is underway and no further information is
available.

The center handles personnel matters for the medical
examiner's lab.
