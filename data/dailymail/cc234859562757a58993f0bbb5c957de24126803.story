Cristiano Ronaldo could follow in the footsteps of David Beckham and Frank Lampard by moving to the United States, the Real Madrid star's agent has hinted.

Insisting Ronaldo is the best player of all-time, Jorge Mendes suggested there is a chance the Portugal international could move to America when his deal runs out in 2018.

As Steven Gerrard closes in on a move to LA Galaxy at the age of 34, Ronaldo will be one year younger than the Liverpool captain when his Madrid contract runs out and may decide to make a similar switch.

Speaking to Telefoot, Mendes said of Ronaldo: 'This is the best of all time. No one will be like him.

'Maybe he will go to the USA [after finishing at Madrid]. God will decide.'

Rumours in the past have linked Ronaldo with a return to Manchester United and moves to Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, but Mendes was quick to rule out a move to the French champions.

'In all cases, he will not go to Paris,' said Mendes.

David Beckham joined LA Galaxy from Real Madrid in 2007 before leaving America for PSG six years later

Frank Lampard, currently enjoying a loan spell with Manchester City, joined New York City from Chelsea
