Former First Lady Barbara Bush has made comments suggesting that her son Jeb could be president, backtracking on previous remarks that America has 'had enough Bushes' in the White House.

The Republican matriarch appeared via Skype at a literacy charity fundraiser event her second oldest son was holding for the Barbara Bush Foundation in Bonita Springs, Florida, where he used to be governor.

'Jeb, it’s Mom. Listen, what do you mean, ‘too many Bushes’?... I changed my mind!' she said, according to the Washington Post.

The former First Lady (right, 2010) said she had changed her mind about previous comments she made suggesting that her son  (left) should not run for president because there had been 'enough Bushes' in the White House

Bush had brought up his mother's statement in 2013, when she told NBC's Matt Lauer that there were other qualified candidates besides her children, right before she appeared via video link.

'Hey mom, can I get that in writing by the way,' the younger Bush, who has announced he is 'seriously considering' running for the presidency in 2016, said.

Barbara Bush, 89, who appeared next to former president George H W Bush, said, 'Our problems are so big that it doesn't matter what your last name is in America.'

Jeb Bush replied, 'Mother, I love you. You’re the greatest mother in the world.'

Jeb Bush, who has announced he is 'seriously considering' running for president, referenced his mother's 'enough Bushes' comment before she appeared and walked the remark back

Late last year the potential candidate's mother said that she had shifted her position on Jeb running to 'neutral'. 

She said her previous comments about 'enough Bushes,' which were in direct response to a question about Jeb running for president, were to clarify that the political family does not feel a 'sense of entitlement', according to Bloomberg.

The last several weeks since Jeb's announcement that he is looking at the presidency have seen him begin raising money for his super PAC Right to Rise.

Events have included a $100,000 a plate fundraiser in New York at the home of billionaire Harry Kravis on Wednesday.

The former governor has become the presumptive front runner for the Republican nomination after 2012 candidate Mitt Romney said he would not run again. 

One problem for Bush is the  legacy of his older brother George W Bush, especially two wars that he began in Afghanistan and Iraq during his presidency.

Prepping for a foreign policy speech next week in Chicago, Jeb Bush said 'I won't talk about the past' in response to a question about the wars.

'If I'm in the process of considering the possibility of running, it's not about re-litigating anything in the past.'

The front runner status of both Bush and likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton have raised the idea that the 2016 election will be fought between their two powerful political families.
