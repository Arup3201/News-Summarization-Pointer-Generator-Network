A stay-at-home dad has taken a stand against the modern-day concept of play dates, claiming that they 'alter the spontaneity of our children'.

Chicago native Chris Bernholdt, a father-of-three who runs a blog called DadNCharge, writes that when parents arrange meetings between their children and constantly stimulate them with activities and entertainment, it's detrimental to their independence.

He also harks back to his own childhood, which saw him fending for himself in terms of playtime and consequently learning how to flex his imagination.

Ban the play date! Chicago native Chris Bernholdt, a father-of-three and stay-at-home dad, has taken a stand against the concept of play dates, claiming that they 'alter the spontaneity of our children'

'This 
idea that two kids playing together has to be an event is altering the 
spontaneity of our children,' writes Mr Bernholdt, whose children Adam, Sarah Jane and Heidi are nine, seven and three years old.

'It has become too formal with set dates and
 times and has rendered my son incapable of calling his friends because 
he feels awkward asking, especially when a grown-up answers.'

The former high school teacher adds that it doesn't help when parents encourage a friendship that may not have occurred naturally, or when they force children to adhere to their own agenda.

'Adding the
 word "date" to this phenomena of play has ruined the whole experience for
 me,' he says.

Strange wording: 'Adding the word "date"...makes me feel like I should be preparing a cheese plate and some activity that as a "host" our guest kid will be taking home a fabulous parting gift,' he writes

'It makes me feel like I should be preparing a cheese plate and some
 activity that as a "host" our guest kid will be taking home a fabulous 
parting gift.'

'In my day, we played Star Wars and acted out scenarios from our heads. We climbed trees!'

Not only do play dates put unnecessary pressure on adults, but they also is harmful to children, says Mr Bernholdt, who describes his working wife as 'a rising star in the corporate world'.

'Kids are at their best when their imaginations are in play,' he says. 'We are dumbing down their ability to be 
independent thinkers with scheduled activity, and feeling like we are to 
blame when they have "nothing to do."'

Parenting pro: Mr Bernholdt, a former high school teacher, has been a stay-at-home dad for six years. His children Adam (right), Sarah Jane (middle) and Heidi (left) are nine, seven and three years old

His blog post made quite the impression on readers, amassing more than 150 comments.

Some of the commenters agreed with Mr Bernholdt, with many parents expressing their disappointment that technology plays such a huge role in children's lives these days.

'What is sad is that many times when my kids come back form a play date I hear that all they did was watch TV,' wrote one person. 'When we have kids over, we remove their phones and they are no allowed to watch TV.'

New outlook: 'Let's focus on making our kids play in imaginative ways,' writes Mr Bernholdt (pictured with Adam and a friend). 'Let's lose the structure and remove the dates so they can just focus on playing'

Back in his day, 'I spent most of my time as a kid riding my bike to the park and playing pickup games of basketball and baseball,' writes Mr Bernhardt.

'We played Star Wars for hours and acted out scenarios from our heads. We climbed trees!'

'Let's lose the structure and the formality and remove the dates so they can just focus on playing'

The blogger, who has been a stay-at-home dad for six years, concludes by calling for a ban on the term 'play date'.

'Let's start by banishing the [term] "play date" and focus on just making our kids play in imaginative ways,' he writes. 'Let's lose the structure and the formality and remove the dates so they can just focus on playing.'
