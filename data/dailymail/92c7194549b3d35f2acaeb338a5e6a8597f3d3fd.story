Memphis is in the grip of royal fever as Princes William and Harry arrived in the Tennessee city on Thursday evening for a wedding.

The brothers' every move has been tracked, from the moment Harry arrived by private jet from Miami to when William was snapped getting into a SUV after eating at a popular barbecue restaurant.

One fan was so excited about their arrival in the city that she flew 800 miles from Orlando, Florida, in the hope that she may get to see them.

Beverly McPhail plans to spend the next few days following the brothers as they visit tourist attractions and attend the wedding of Guy Pelly and Holiday Inn heiress Lizzy Wilson.

'I love them! I have been following them since Diana died,' Mrs McPhail told News Channel 3. 'I’m not a stalker. I would call myself a royal watcher. An American royal watcher.'

McPhail, who flew to London for William's wedding to Kate Middleton three years ago, says she planned on staying in Memphis until Sunday, and would travel to places the royals were due to be at.

Memphis resident Andrea LaTard was also keen to catch a glimpse of the two princes, and deserted her friends who were watching a Grizzlies basketball game to wait outside the Rendezvous.

'I waited outside alone like the crazed fan I am!' she tweeted, before adding: 'I saw the royals tonight. My life = complete.'

The Princes are staying at the luxury Peabody Hotel, where they are believed to have booked an entire floor. 

Their cousins, Princess Eugenie and 
Beatrice are also attending the wedding. Eugenie was photographed 
arriving in Memphis on Thursday evening, wearing black jeans and a 
leather jacket and holding what appeared to be Lulu Guinness clutch bag.

On Thursday evening the brothers were met with cheers from about 100 bystanders who had gathered outside the Rendezvous barbecue restaurant.

Both were dressed down for the occasion in jeans and shirts, with William appearing to have opted for a country look with a red and blue checked shirt.

Rumours that they would be eating at the barbecue restaurant had been circulating all day after police were seen scouting out the popular eatery.

William and Harry were part of a party of 175 guests of Pelly and Wilson, who were seated in an upstairs room of the restaurant.

The guests were served ribs, chicken, and sausage and cheese plates.

Restaurant owner John Vergos told USA Today the guests appeared to enjoy the meal and that 'a lot of the British like Jack Daniels'.

'Everybody complimented us on the food ... We've been able to feed the presidents and now we feed Prince Harry and Prince William, so it's pretty cool.'

A few hours later the party were seen leaving the restaurant, which is just a short distance from the Peabody hotel, though it was unclear where they planned to head next.

The princes and their royal cousins are planning to take in a visit to Gracelands - the Memphis estate that belonged to king of rock and roll Elvis Presley - on Friday.

They will have the chance to have a tour of Graceland, wandering the 
Jungle Room, with its green shaggy carpets, the Trophy Building which 
houses all The King’s awards, as well as the luxury living room – all 
decorated with furnishings from the eras Elvis lived in the property.

The wedding party is expected to visit Beale Street in downtown Memphis too, which has been famous for its blues clubs since the early 1900s.

They will then attend the two-day wedding ceremony of Pelly and Wilson, which is being held at Memphis Country Club.

Harry, who recently split from his girlfriend Cressida Bonas, was given an extra special welcome to Memphis by a strip club, who put up a sign in his honor. 

Jerry Westlund, 46, who owns The Pony 
club, said: ‘Clearly Prince Harry has come to the U.S. in the past and 
shown he likes to enjoy himself, and Las Vegas is not the only place to 
party in the States.'

He arranged to have a sign reading: 'Welcome Prince Harry' put up under the club's official sign.

escorted along a red carpet the lobby fountain each day, William and 
Harry will be staying at a private house next to the wedding venue.

When

which includes a duck house modelled on the hotel's exterior. 

The 
princes have reportedly been told to keep a low profile during the trip.
 Nightclub entrepreneur Pelly is reportedly considered a ‘bad 
influence’ on Prince Harry, and even arranged the Duke of Cambridge’s 
stag do.

Prince Harry arrived in the U.S. earlier this week, and enjoyed a short stay in Miami where he appeared carefree despite his split from girlfriend Cressida Bonas at the weekend.

The 29-year-old was spotted in a private section of the the LIV nightclub, which is popular with celebrities such as Jay-Z and Kanye West, and at one point, he was seen hugging a mysterious brunette.

Harry was later seen boarding a private jet in Miami on Thursday afternoon, and his brother William, fresh from a royal tour to New Zealand and Australia, was seen in an airport lounge at Chicago's O'Hare airport.

Memphis mayor A C Wharton said his city was ready to welcome the royal family, but asked residents and tourists to respect their privacy while they attend the wedding.
