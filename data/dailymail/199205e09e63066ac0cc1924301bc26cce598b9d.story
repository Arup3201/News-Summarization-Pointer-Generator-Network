Makeshift camps including a library and pharmacies have been set up by Wall Street protesters in a clear sign that they intend to carry out their promise of staying into the winter.

The development came after thousands of people yesterday marched to New York Police Department (NYPD) headquarters following accusations of brutality from officers dealing with demonstrators.

Similar protests against the banking system have spread across the country, with events taking place up in Boston, Los Angeles and Chicago.

New York City police are braced for a 
weekend of unrest in the Financial District, with the Occupy Wall Street
 protest showing little sign of dissipating as it moves into its third 
straight week.

People have travelled from all over the country to voice their anger at the 2008 bank bailouts, rising numbers of foreclosures and persistently high unemployment.

Protesters signalled their intention 
to keep a presence in Zuccotti Park, just outside Wall Street, by 
setting up larger camps of mattresses and sleeping bags, and laying out a
 basic library, newspaper stands, pharmacies and I.T. hubs.

Yesterday, the Occupy Wall Street protesters marched several blocks north to the NYPD headquarters 
and demonstrated there for about two hours.

Critics have accused officers of being
 heavy-handed, saying they have roughed up people who did nothing wrong. The NYPD has disputed that claim.

Protesters also say they're upset 
about reports from The Associated Press that an NYPD intelligence unit 
has sought to infiltrate the city's Muslim community.

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg addressed the demonstrations on the WOR 710 radio show on Friday and sought to undermine the focus of their ire.

He: 'The protesters are protesting against people who make $40,000 to $50,000 a year who are struggling to make ends meet. That’s the bottom line.'

When asked how the NYPD would handle protests, Mayor Bloomberg said that while people have the right to protest, others also have the right 'to walk down the street unmolested.'

Demonstrations have sprung up in 
other parts of the U.S., with an event in Boston today, called Take Back
 the Block, attended by at least 1,500 people.

An Occupy Chicago movement has 
emerged, with nearly 100 people gathering in front of the Chicago 
Federal Reserve Bank. The protests have been peaceful and no arrests 
have been reported.

Occupy Los Angeles protests which 
have also been small in numbers, has called for a march today at 10am 
from Pershing Square downtown to City Hall.

The increasing presence of more affluent-looking demonstrators is 
fuelling questions over whether this is the moment a frustrated middle 
America is uniting for a national uprising.

The protest encampment in Zuccotti 
Park in downtown Manhattan is festooned with placards and anti-Wall 
Street slogans.

Celebrities from film-maker Michael Moore to actress Susan Sarandon have 
stopped by to show solidarity.

Grungy youths sleeping on the street, 
topless women waving signs stating 'I love this country', and ageing 
hippies have won their share of national headlines for their cries of 
rebellion.

But among these protesters are also men wearing suits and mothers who have driven in from the suburbs.

Julien Harrison, an aspiring teacher,
 was among the frustrated masses, travelling from Portland, Maine to 
voice his frustration. Mr Harrison, who said his student debt amounts to
 $50,000, has only been able to find only manual labour since getting 
his master's degree.

He 
told VOA News: 'Of course, they’re laying off teachers all over the 
country,' he said. 'It’s getting more and more competitive. I just came 
from Portland. There’s people with Ph.Ds, masters, undergraduate degrees
 competing to be a barista at a coffee shop.'

The
 'people powered movement for 
democracy' - inspired by the Egyptian Tahrir Square uprising and the 
Spanish acampadas - has been targeted by critics who say the rallies, 
thanks to a vague list of demands and disorganised leadership, will be 
only a footnote in the history of middle America's growing frustration 
with unemployment and a dismal economic forecast. 

But demonstrators say otherwise.

Susie and Artie Ravitz stand next to 
Carlson. Retirees from Easton, Pennsylvania, told the Huffington Post 
they drove to lower Manhattan to add numbers to the uprising.

'The main thing is to draw attention 
to the disparities,' she said. 'The rich and the greedy are taking the 
country down. It's really a discouraging time.

'You have young people 
with college degrees left out in the cold, unable to find jobs. I have 
kids and grandchildren. I really worry what their lives are going to be 
like.'

Ben Yost, a 36-year-old social worker
 from Brooklyn, was spotted by the website waving a sign with check 
marks next to: WAR IN IRAQ. RECESSION. UNEMPLOYMENT. WAR IN AFGHANISTAN.
 Then a question: WHO'S MAKING MONEY? WALL STREET PROFITEERS.

He said of the movement: 'We need to 
just get a conversation growing and build a community and figure out how
 to get some of the money out of the corporations and back to the people
 who deserve it.'

Smaller protests have also sprouted in other cities, including Boston, Chicago and San Francisco.

Marty Goodman, a unionized subway 
worker, said, 'Last year we had 900 of our members laid off... These are
 our issues too: Wall Street, the banks, layoffs, the struggle that 
these young people are spearheading is our struggle too.'

Among those pledging solidarity were 
the United Federation of Teachers and the Transport Workers Union Local 
100, which has 38,000 members. The unions could provide important 
organizational and financial support for the largely leaderless 
movement.

On Friday, demonstrators who camped 
out for fourteen straight days gathered once again to march to police 
headquarters over what they viewed as excessive force used against 
demonstrators, minorities and Muslims.

Last week, police arrested 80 people 
during a march to the bustling Union Square shopping district, the most 
arrests from a demonstration since hundreds were detained outside the 
Republican National Convention in 2004.

A police commander used pepper spray 
on four women at that march, and a video of the incident went viral on 
the Internet, angering many protesters who vowed to continue their 
protests indefinitely.

Police have said pepper spray was a better alternative than night sticks to subdue those blocking traffic.

Reports of police brutality have prompted military veteran to join the fray.

A thread on Reddit.com from from user theenemywasme incided nearly 2,000 comments on Friday after his call to 'protect the people and the constitution' of the U.S. by acting as a 'first line of defense' between police officers and peaceful protesters.

'I'm heading up there tonight in my dress blues. So far, 15 of my fellow marine buddies are meeting me there, also in Uniform,' the post reads.

'I want to send the following message to Wall St and Congress: I didn't fight for Wall St. I fought for America. Now it's Congress' turn.'

By early Friday, more than 
500 people on Friday were gathered ahead of the start of the planned 
late afternoon march to One Police Plaza, the centre of police 
operations, in downtown Manhattan.

Online flyers for Friday's march 
read: 'No to Stop-and-Frisk in Black & Latino neighbourhoods' and 'No
 to Spying and Harassment of Muslim Communities.'

The crowd was boosted by an 
announcement that the rock band Radiohead would perform at 4pm. Later, 
organizers posted a brief statement on their website, saying, 'Radiohead
 will not being playing. This was a hoax. Please accept our apologies.'

'We heard about Radiohead coming here
 on Facebook,' said Alegra Felter, a 34-year-old teacher from Brooklyn 
who was among the disappointed rock fans.

By 5pm the march had yet to start as 
more people gathered, spilling out of the plaza onto nearby streets, 
blocking traffic and making it hard for Wall Street executives and 
workers walking to subways.

Asked on his weekly radio show on 
Friday whether the protesters could stay indefinitely at the private 
park they call their base, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said, 'We'll see.'

Bloomberg added: 'People have a right
 to protest but we also have to make sure that people who don't want to 
protest can go down the street unmolested.'
