A former beauty queen turned prostitute has been convicted of possessing drugs after trying to swallow her stash of cocaine.

Natalie Gentle, 32, who was once a contestant in a 'Face of 2007' competition, started working as as prostitute from her home in Plymouth, Devon, after she spiralled into a life of drugs. 

Police were waiting outside her home in the Ernesettle area of the city when she pulled up outside her flat in a taxi.

When she noticed them she was spotted slipping something into her mouth and after officers asked her to open it they discovered it was a wrap of cocaine.

Plymouth Crown Court heard that when police found the Class A drug she said: 'It's only personal, it's only £20 worth'. 

After raiding her home they also uncovered items including a pipe, tin foil and a knife and she was later evicted after plaguing her neighbours with her sexual activities. 

Gentle pleaded guilty in court to possession and was given a two-year conditional discharge.

Alistair Verheijen, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'On August 6 police attended Miss Gentle's residence but she wasn't home.

'The police officers saw her arrive, and noted that she had noticed them. Immediately her body language changed, and she put something into her mouth.

She admitted possession of cocaine after police found her trying to hide a 'wrap' in her mouth

'Police asked her to open her mouth where they found a wrap. She then said - "it's only personal, it's only £20 worth".

'Examination later revealed that the wrap contained 0.47g of cocaine.'

Gentle was a contestant in the '2007 Face Of Plymouth' event but started using her flat in the city for prostitution.

In 2010 she was given an ASBO banning men from entering her property but was earlier this year evicted after ongoing anti-social behaviour.

Defending, Will Rose, explained how Miss Gentle was a recovering heroin addict, with other medical ailments.

He said: 'She has managed to steer clear for two and a half years, although she does suffer from other medical conditions.

'She was on a course of methadone but she has now been off that for seven days.'

Judge Alan Large, said: 'I have only one option for this case and that is conditional discharge, and that is far too lenient in my opinion.

'You need to understand that if you are back here again with a record like this you will go to prison.'

Last month, Plymouth magistrates evicted the former pole dancer and beauty queen contestant from her flat, after neighbours had complained.

They claimed there was constant noise and for five years had men knocking on their doors and shouting through their letter boxes asking 'where the prostitute is?'.

During her eviction appearance at magistrates, prosecutor Dylan Sadler told Gentle: 'You are a prostitute, men visit that premises as you offer that service and you use this to finance a heroin habit.

'You are fully aware that dealing drugs goes on from your premises and it causes immense problems for people living around you.'
