A Chinese dog-owner is suing an animal clinic after his £90,000 Tibetan Mastiff died while undergoing a facelift to make it more attractive to breeders.

The owner, identified only as Mr Yu, paid 1,000 yuan (£140) for his pet to have plastic surgery at a Beijing animal hospital last November.

It died on the operating table 20 minutes into treatment. Mr Yu later discovered that the dog had died of a heart attack after complications with the anaesthetic.

He is now suing the hospital for 880,000 yuan (£90,000), the amount he claims to have paid for the Tibetan Mastiff which is the world's most expensive breed of dog.

World's most expensive breed: A red Tibetan Mastiff called Big Splash or Hong Dong was bought by a Chinese coal baron for £945,000 in 2011

Breeding Tibetan Mastiffs has become a lucrative business in China after the animals became a sought-after status symbol.

Mr Yu, who runs a breeding centre in Beijing, told the Global Times: 'If my dog looks better, female dog owners will pay a higher price when they want to mate their dog with mine.'

The breed became the world's most expensive in 2011 after a Chinese coal baron spent nearly £1million - £945,000 - on a Tibetan Mastiff called Big Splash or Hong Dong in Chinese.

Millionaire dog breeder Li Yongfu told 
China's official news agency Xinhua: 'If you are rich, you can easily 
buy a big house or a Lamborghini.

They live for up to 14 years and have fewer genetic health problems than many breeds.

The heaviest Tibetan Mastiff weighed in at more than 20 stone.

They are fed an organic 
diet of tripe, boiled fish heads, powdered egg shells, code liver oil 
and raw bones to help them clean their teeth.

Marco
Polo supposedly encountered Tibetan Mastiffs in the 13th century, 
describing them as ‘tall as a donkey with a voice as powerful as that of
a lion’.

There are only around 300 Tibetan Mastiffs in the UK.

They can only have one litter a year.

In the UK Tibetan Mastiffs cost between £850 and £1,000 for a puppy. An English Bulldog sells for around £2,000.

It is thought the Tibetan Mastiff genetically diverged from the wolf 58,000 years ago.

'But owning a pure-bred mastiff is quite another thing. It's solid evidence of your wealth, power and taste, and makes a most presentable gift for your clients and partners.

And the demand for Tibetan Mastiffs doesn't appear to be waning with a male called Emperor goign on the market for a staggering 10 million Yuan - £1million - last year.

The average price being asked for one of the dogs last year was around 1 million Yuan (£100,000).

The Tibetan Mastiff is an ancient breed of dog, originating from the nomadic cultures of Central Asia.

It has become a status symbol in China because they are thought to be holy animals, blessing their owners' health and security.

Tibetans believe the dogs have the souls of monks and nuns who were not good enough to be reincarnated as humans or into Shambhala, the heavenly realm.

As well as costing a fortune to buy, Tibetan Mastiffs are also incredibly expensive to keep.

Owners need a large house as the breed have been known to weigh as much as 286lb, or more than 20 stone – the same as a sizeable rugby player. However the typical weight for a fully grown Tibetan Mastiff is around 13 stone.

Their diet consists of chicken and beef spiced up with Chinese delicacies such as sea cucumber and abalone.

Owners of the breed have included Queen Victoria, King George IV and  Genghis Khan – who supposedly took 30,000 of the dogs with his army in his bid to conquer Western Europe.

There are now only around 300 Tibetan mastiffs in the UK, and puppies sell for a more reasonable £1,000.
