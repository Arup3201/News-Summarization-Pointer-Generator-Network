A fleet of Royal Mail vans were left with parking tickets perched under their windscreen wipers after new permits appeared to be late in the post.

Ten vans were slapped with fines after they parked in a car park without the correct permit.

It is understood the fleet from Shepton Mallet in Somerset had applied for new season tickets but they had not been delivered in time to replace the expired ones.

A spokeswoman for Mendip District Council said the reason behind the charges was because they had failed to renew their season tickets in time.

She said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases, but we would like to remind tickets holders they must renew their season tickets.'

Royal Mail spokesman, Mike Norman, said that the permits had been applied for but they had not yet arrived.

In total 10 vans were left with fine notices perched under their windscreen wipers in the Shepton Mallet car park
