TV cameras filmed a case in one of the highest courts in the country for the first time yesterday in a ‘landmark moment for justice and journalism’.

Viewers watched the Prime Minister’s brother Alex Cameron, QC, attempt to reduce the sentence of the ringleader of a coin-forging gang at the Court of Appeal.

After the hearing David Cameron appeared to support the wider introduction of cameras in other courts to promote ‘open justice’.

PM's brother: Barrister Alexander Cameron QC was shown attempting to reduce the sentence of a ringleader of a coin-forging gang when cameras were allowed to film a case in the Court of Appeal for the first time

Yesterday’s case in London was broadcast live on the BBC and Sky News and screened live on the ITV and C4 websites.

Barrister Mr Cameron, whose appearance on the first televised case was a coincidence, was unsuccessful in his appeal.

Asked how he felt about being the first barrister to appear on TV at the Court of Appeal, he said: ‘It’s surprising.’

His younger brother, the Prime Minister, said: ‘I couldn’t help notice that the barrister in the case was actually my brother which was a surprise to me this morning as I think it was a surprise to him.’

Asked if he wanted to see broadcasting extended to criminal trials, the Prime Minister said: ‘Open justice, open government is a good thing. Let’s see how it goes to see if more [cases] can be brought on camera in front of the people whose justice it is, rather than hidden behind closed doors.’ 

Five courtrooms of the Court of Appeal in London have discreet fixed cameras in them which can be operated by a court video journalist who has both legal and journalistic qualifications.

Landmark: Three judges, Judge Anthony Morris QC, Lord Justice Pitchford and Mr Justice Globe heard the case of Kevin Fisher was applying for leave to appeal against his seven years sentence for counterfeiting offences

Some cases will be broadcast live on rolling channels with a 70-second delay to allow the removal of anything that contravenes broadcasting regulations or standard court reporting restrictions, such as contempt of court laws and court orders. Footage can also be broadcast on news bulletins. But it cannot be used for satire, entertainment or for commercial use.

Lawyers’ arguments and judges’ summing up, decisions and – in criminal cases – sentencing remarks may be filmed but victims, witnesses and defendants will not be filmed.

James Harding, BBC director of news and current affairs, said: ‘This is a landmark moment for justice and journalism. It is a significant step on the way to helping millions of viewers gain a greater understanding of  how our judicial system works.’ 

Yesterday’s case centred on Kevin Fisher’s seven-year jail term for his role in what is believed to be the largest-ever plot to make fake pound coins in Britain.

Fisher, 55, of Goffs Oak, Hertfordshire, was jailed in May with two other men after police recovered 80,000 fake £1 coins and a large quantity of blank metal discs that would have created coins with a total face value of £1.5million.

Alex Cameron had argued that the sentence given to Fisher was higher than sentences imposed in similar cases and there was an unfair disparity between Fisher’s sentence and those given to his co-conspirators. But the judges upheld the original sentence.
