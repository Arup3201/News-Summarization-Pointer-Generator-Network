The phenomenon of ‘lunchtime beauty’, which sees time pressured women eager to squeeze in as many treatments as possible into their hour break, shows no signs of abating.

While most of us make do with popping to the salon round the corner, who will do a mini mani-pedi simultaneously, some women can afford some seriously luxe high-speed beautifying.

Meeting this demand for indulgent all-in-one salon sessions is the Daniel Galvin Jr salon in Belgravia, where women can enjoy a mani, pedi, foot massage, full head of highlights, cut and blow dry, gourmet lunch and champagne, for an eye-watering £1,200.

Set in the heart of ultra-posh Belgravia the studio screams 'place to be seen'

All this pampering requires two hours, and while many may take this an opportunity to sit back and enjoy a little ‘me time’, those who can’t leave the office behind needn’t fret.

Customers are provided with wifi, iPhone chargers and even their own PA as the various beauticians scurry around them.

The PA, who usually acts as Daniel's assistant, is made available to clients who have opted for the bespoke express service to run errands and organise any appointments they want. 

Of course, one of the main attractions of the package – and part of its extreme price tag - is getting your hair done by salon owner and celebrity hairdresser Daniel Galvin Jr himself.

Having appeared as an expert on numerous television shows, Daniel also quaffs the hair of celebrity clients such as Kelly Brook, Amanda Holden, Holly Valance, Danielle Lineker, Louis Walsh and Trevor Eve.

The salon itself is no doubt also part of the £1,200 cost.

Set in the heart of ultra-posh Belgravia, the studio screams ‘place to be seen’.

It is also is super eco-friendly, aiming to to be the first in the UK to have a carbon-neutral footprint within 12 months of opening by using clever recycling and organic products.

And forget a lukewarm cappuccino with a mini chocolate, this salon session includes a lunch by world-renowned restaurant Ottolenghi.

While the haircut and blow-dry gets underway, customers can tuck into to such gastronomic delights as salt-crusted fish with Mediterranean salad, fettuccine with fresh seafood and a green harissa dressing or veal, olive and pancetta stew with roasted red pepper.  For pudding, choose between mouth-watering delights such as honey and apricot trifle with walnuts and lavender and sweet and salty cheesecake with cherries and crumble.

The salon says of their new service: 'The bespoke service is for the high-powered businesswomen whose time is of great value but who also wants and needs to utilise every working minute while maintaining her appearance.

'As with all colour treatments, clients can be in the chair for up to four hours, waiting for their colour to process, working away on their i-Pads, willing the time to pass so they can get back to their desks. 

'Now, for the first time in any salon in the UK, Daniel Galvin Jr is offering a double-colourist service whereby Daniel and his senior protégé, Olyvia, will work on the same head of hair to ensure an expert service in over half the time.'

Daniel Galvin Jr says: 'I’ve realised over the years that many of my powerful CEO clients that time is money. Four hours out of a working day is not commercially viable and down time on a Saturday and Sunday is valuable time for these career women - they value and cherish time with their children and family so spending four hours in the salon is time they have.

'One of my clients had asked me if there is any concept that I could think of that would help them fast track this time-consuming appointment so I created this method and technique so they could maximise on their visit at the salon, getting the most productive results whilst not compromising on valuable office time in their working day.'
