The stock market suffered its biggest collapse in three years yesterday as the global economy plunged deeper into crisis, wiping billions off the value of Britain's leading companies.

Every blue-chip firm listed in London fell in the worst single day of trading since the dark days of 2008 when investment bank Lehman Brothers imploded.

As analysts spoke of 'a tidal wave of selling', the FTSE 100 index fell 239.37 points to 5092.23 – a drop in value of £62.3billion.

Plummeting: The FTSE crashed by 5 per cent today against a backdrop of the euro zone crisis and damaging U.S. unemployment figures

Elsewhere, the German stock market 
fell 5.8 per cent, Paris dropped 5.5 per cent and the Dow Jones 
Industrial  Average dropped 3.9 per cent in  New York.

The Lehman debacle tipped the global 
economy into recession – and fears are mounting that the developed world
is on the brink of another devastating downturn.

One reason for the panic was the 
revelation that a lender in the eurozone was forced to go cap in hand to
the European Central Bank for £300million in emergency funding.

Analysts said the 'worrying' 
development showed banks are too nervous to lend to each other – just as
they were at the height of the financial crisis.

Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley 
warned yesterday that the United States and the eurozone are 'hovering 
dangerously close to recession'.

Despair may have engulfed the markets, but one British entrepreneur found himself £300million richer yesterday.

Dr Mike Lynch, the son of an Essex fireman, saw his software firm Autonomy sold to U.S. giant Hewlett-Packard for £7billion.

The deal values his 8.1 per cent stake in the FTSE 100 firm at £567million. It was worth just under £284million before the takeover bid was announced.

It is an extraordinary success for Dr Lynch, who began work on the firm when he was writing his post-doctoral thesis at Cambridge University on 18th century theologian Thomas Bayes, who tried to prove the existence of God through mathematics.

Autonomy now has more than 16,000 clients worldwide including Nasa, Procter & Gamble, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The technology Dr Lynch developed allows computers to analyse data across a range of media, making it useful for tracking down fraud or even searching for terrorists.

Investors are also increasingly 
concerned about the health of the banking system in Europe as the 
debt-crisis crippling the single currency bloc rumbles on.

Officials at the Bank of England said the exaggerated sense of fear in the markets may be holding back the recovery.

The man who became a hate figure to 
many in Britain for designing the modern European Union yesterday 
admitted that it was now 'on the edge of the precipice'.

Jacques Delors, 86, a federalist 
Frenchman, used his time as European Commission chief in the 1980s to 
expand its power over national governments and pave the way for the 
single European currency.

Will Hedden, at IG Index in London, said: 'Panic selling accelerated in the biggest losing day yet of this summer sell-off.

'The fear factor has reached boiling 
point. Banking stocks have been decimated across Europe, with 
indiscriminate selling even in banks that maintain that their exposure 
to the crisis is slim.

'No sector is surviving this tidal wave of selling.'

Damaging confidence: Analysts say German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy's plans to bail out debt-ridden eurozone members would disproportionately hit the UK

The financial markets have been rocked
by a crisis of leadership in recent weeks as politicians on both sides 
of the Atlantic failed to come up with policies to tackle debts and 
promote growth.

The FTSE 100 index has lost 1,000 points, or £260billion of its value, since its 2011 peak in February.

Dark days: Today's jobless figures have done nothing for Barack Obama's domestic standing

The majority of the slump has taken place this month in one of the most bruising episodes in stock market history.

It has hit the value of retirement 
pots for millions and left investors across the country nursing heavy 
losses.

UK bank shares were the worst hit in London yesterday with 
taxpayer-supported Royal Bank of Scotland down 11.3 per cent and Lloyds 
Banking Group down 9.3 per cent.

The shares are worth less than half 
what they were when the Government bailed the banks out – meaning UK 
taxpayers are sitting on losses of £34.5billion in the two companies.

The European banking sector has lost 
30 per cent of its value this year. French banks were back in the firing
line yesterday with Societe Generale down 11.6 per cent.

It came after 
the ECB provided more than £300million of emergency funds to an unnamed 
lender – the first such loan since February.

'This shows that the situation has escalated,' said Citigroup analyst Juergen Michels.

Morgan Stanley cut its global growth 
forecasts for this year from 4.2 per cent to 3.9 per cent and for 2012 
from 4.5 per cent to 3.8 per cent.

'The path now looks even more bumpy, 
below-par and brittle than previously thought,' said Joachim Fels, who 
co-heads Morgan Stanley's global economic team.

He said the main reason for the 
downturn was the failure of politicians and regulators in Washington and
Europe to tackle the sovereign debt crisis crippling the world economy.

Hundreds of thousands of families in
the UK are over-indebted and 'vulnerable' if financial conditions get 
worse, a senior Bank of England director said last night.

Andrew Haldane, the Bank's executive 
director in charge of ensuring financial stability, said one in 14 
British households is in negative equity.

ANALYSIS by RUTH SUTHERLAND, Associate City Editor

'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself': President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing the Banking Bill at the White House in 1933

During his inaugural address in 1933, newly elected U.S. President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt famously told the American people: 'The only thing
we have to fear is fear itself.'

Today, the world is clouded with economic and political uncertainty just
as it was in the dark days following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and 
the Great Depression.

As people are forced to watch impotently as stock markets lurch once 
again into turmoil, wiping billions of pounds off the value of their 
savings and pensions, it is understandable that many are riven with 
anxiety.

Fear is stalking the trading floors and it is contagious, casting an ominous shadow over all of our lives.

But the question is whether the extreme reactions we have seen on the stock markets over the past few weeks are justified.

As Andrew Haldane, a senior director at the Bank of England, pointed out yesterday, the fear factor is rampant on the markets.

Not all of it is rational, and these waves of terror engulfing the stock exchanges are actually making matters worse.

During the boom, traders were swept along by a wave of euphoria and 
loaded themselves with risks that proved to be wildly over-optimistic.

Haldane now believes the markets may have switched to the opposite pole,
with traders abnormally reluctant to take  risks because the 
psychological scarring from the losses of the last meltdown is still 
fresh and painful.

That exaggerated fear of risk – equally irrational as the mindless 
exuberance of the boom years – is in itself a brake on economic 
recovery.

When stock markets plunge, companies become reluctant to expand or 
invest. Consumers cut down on their spending and stay out of the shops. 
Instead of applying our energy to creating growth, building new 
businesses and embarking on new ventures, firms and individuals retreat 
into a paralysing state of gloom and timidity.

With markets in the paranoid state of the past few weeks, even minor or 
quite predictable pieces of news can produce enormous swings on the 
trading screens. No-one should underestimate the power of herd-behaviour
on the markets, which are driven by the opposing forces of greed and 
fear.

Driven by greed and fear: A man walks past the London Stock Exchange in the City of London. A Cambridge study found hormone levels significantly affected traders' behaviour

Cambridge University researchers even found in a study of saliva from 
City workers that hormonal activity among young male traders magnified 
the booms and busts.

They discovered that when dealers hit a winning streak their 
testosterone levels soared, making them overconfident and intoxicated 
with their own success.

But when markets dipped, the researchers saw a rise in the stress 
hormone cortisol, which made the dealers shy of risk and magnified the 
downward slide in markets.

But there are some very good reasons to be fearful. The banking crisis 
that caused the market meltdown in 2008 has transformed itself into a 
sovereign debt crisis.

Question marks now hover over the indebtedness not only of smaller 
nations such as Greece and Portugal, but even the United States, whose 
Treasury bonds were once considered impregnable.

Many households, banks and countries remain dangerously mired under the weight of their own foolish borrowings.

Keep calm and carry on: A stock market trader grips his forehead as shares tumble in this picture from the 2008 crash. Dealers can and do wipe millions from the value of shares as the mood takes them

But panic does not help. We should not allow the economic recovery in 
this country to be held hostage to hysteria in the dealing rooms.

The dealers can and do wipe billions of pounds off share values as the 
mood takes them – often for the points slashed from the FTSE 100 to be 
restored the next day.

But whatever their frenzy leads them to do, most of the real assets that
are vital to our economy remain unaffected.

Our homes, offices and 
factories are still standing; we still have our brainpower and most of 
all our resilience. 

To use another catchphrase from the 1930s, when markets succumb to a bout of madness, we need to 'Keep Calm and Carry On.
