Steven Fletcher has pleaded with Gus Poyet to recall him to the Sunderland side for this weekend’s Tyne-Wear derby after Jozy Altidore’s goal drought extended to over a year.

American striker Altidore has started the last two in place of Fletcher but has failed to add to his one Premier League strike, which came on December 4 last year.

The £6.5million frontman was guilty of a glaring miss during Saturday’s 1-1 draw with West Ham when he swung at fresh air just five yards from an open goal.

Altidore was eventually replaced by four-goal top scorer Fletcher, and the Scotland international has told manager Poyet that he is ready to start at St James’ Park having missed the last two 3-0 victories on Tyneside.

‘I had a little niggle after the Man City game so I missed Liverpool, which was disappointing, but I got on against West Ham and I feel fully fit now,’ he said.

‘I missed both 3-0 wins through injury so I want to be involved next week. ‘We’ve got a good record there but their form has picked up as well. But there’ s no point in putting extra pressure on ourselves because that won’t help.

‘I’m looking forward to going there. I’ve only played there once before for Wolves.’ Fletcher did score against Newcastle during last season’s 2-1 victory at the Stadium of Light.

And he reflected: ‘Scoring against Newcastle at the Stadium of Light is definitely the highlight of my Sunderland career so far. ‘It was a great moment. I don’t think I’d scored for a while when I did so I was a bit emotional.’ 

The Black Cats are without a win in six having drawn five of those matches to leave them two points above the relegation zone and Poyet has admitted that he doesn’t enjoy watching his team play.

Fletcher, however, says there is no need to panic just yet.

‘The draws can’t be a bad thing,’ he said. ‘It’s a point and we’re happy as long as we can start turning the draws into wins.

‘We’re creating chances so if we start putting them away we will start winning games. We are hard to beat at the moment.

‘From last year to this season it’s a big positive for us to have more points on the board. We can still have a good season.

‘There are some games you look at this season that we probably would have lost last year. We’ve shut the door at the back and we if we keep creating chances we will be okay.’
