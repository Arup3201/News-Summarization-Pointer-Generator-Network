Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton has been dumped by Nicole Scherzinger.

The pair had been together seven years but  the 36-year-old singer has left Hamilton due to the pressures of a long-distance relationship.

A source close to the star told MailOnline: 'It was a mutual decision. The long distance kept them apart for long periods of time.

'They both spent most of their time alone because they were in different countries all the time. Nicole is heartbroken and devastated.'

Nicole - currently starring in the West End revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, Cats, in London - primarily resides in Los Angeles, while Lewis is based in Monaco.

The Sun reported on Wednesday that Hamilton, testing in Jerez on Wednesday, was dumped because he refused to marry Scherzinger and start a family. 

It comes following Hamilton's interview with The Sunday Times Style magazine in December, when the F1 star insisted the pair had no plans to marry due to work commitments.

'We're in a good place. She's such a hard worker, and we inspire each other. But I don't think we've ever really discussed marriage,' Hamilton said.

'We're very much aware of the time together, and how precious time is. I think naturally, at some stage, that becomes a step. But we're trying to support each other while we do things we love.'
