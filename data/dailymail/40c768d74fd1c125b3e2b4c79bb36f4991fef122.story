Newmarket trainer Phil McEntee flies out to California this morning hoping filly Living The Life can make sure he lives the American dream.

Europe, buoyed by last year’s success, launches one of its strongest ever numerical challenges for the Breeders’ Cup which gets under way at Santa Anita racecourse tonight.

If Living The Life can land Saturday's $1million Filly & Mare Sprint, her success will be credited to US trainer Gary Mandella. But the four-year-old’s success will have its foundations firmly rooted in British All-Weather racing.

The filly was acquired by Phil McEntee for Hank Nothhaft and is trained by Gary Mandella

She looked a decent but relatively modest performer when acquired for US owner Hank Nothhaft by McEntee to inject some European blood into his North America operation.

But before she shipped out to the States she emphatically lifted the £91,000 first prize in the Fillies’ & Mares’ Championships Conditions Stakes at the inaugural All-Weather Finals Day staged on Good Friday at Lingfield.

McEntee, whose brother Carl is Nothhaft’s racing manager, said: ‘After we got her she started improving and after her second start for me I told Hank we should qualify her for this race.’

Since being sent across the Atlantic, Living The Life has won both her races, including a Group Two race at Presque Isle Downs.

Both of those races were on synthetic surfaces similar to those she raced on in Britain. Tomorrow’s race will be her first on traditional US Dirt but McEntee is hopeful she can overcome that obstacle.

McEntee added: ‘She has been at Santa Anita for the last seven weeks. Gary is very pleased with her. She has done a lot of work on the Dirt with her jockey Rafael Bejarano riding her and the vibes are positive.

‘The Filly & Mare Sprint is a funny race. It is over seven furlongs and all Living The Life’s wins in Britain have been over that distance. There are others in it who are six-furlong horses stepping up or milers dropping back.’

Living The Life’s is 10-1 shot and McEntee is hoping the galloping advert will bring him fresh US clients.

McEntee revealed they are very positive about Living The Life's condition, saying she has been training well

Europe will be hoping for a bright start to the Breeders’ Cup on Friday night. The challenge for the Juvenile Turf is headed by Charlie Hills-trained Autumn Stakes winner Commemorative but Hugo Palmer has had to withdraw his Solario Stakes winner Aktabantay because the colt has a sore foot.

Palmer said: ‘He worked and moved really well this morning and I was growing in confidence about his chances. Unfortunately, that confidence did not last long as he was found to have a sore foot when he returned back to the barn and I had to make the decision to scratch him.’

Aktabantay’s absence has created a slot in the line-up for Brian Meehan-trained Faithful Creek, who had been on stand-by as first reserve. He will be ridden by Kieren Fallon.

Aidan O’Brien’s Qualify has the form to go close in the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf but from wide stall will need an inspired Ryan Moore ride to succeed. Richard Hannon’s Osaila (Frankie Dettori) is better placed in stall two.

The organisers of the All Weather Championships could not wish for a better advert than Living the Life.

It was day one of the second year of the programme at Lingfield yesterday when Charlie Appleby’s Tearless (Adam Kirby) landed the Listed Fleur De Lys Fillies’ Stakes, a Fast Track Qualifier to Good Friday Finals day.

Innovations this year are qualifying races in Dubai, France and Ireland and a new three-year-old sprint category. 

Trainer Roger Varian landed his fifth Group One race of the season when Vert De Grece landed the Criterium International at Saint-Cloud under jockey Umberto Rispoli.
