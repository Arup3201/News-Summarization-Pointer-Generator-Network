Manchester City supporters embraced the festive cheer at the Etihad on Sunday - by taking part in a fun run dressed as sky-blue-and-white Santa Clauses!

The club's fifth annual Santa Stroll saw supporters clad in City-inspired festive dress parading around the Ethiad Campus in order to raise money for charity.

Adults paid £10 for a Santa suit and kids £5 as City raised money for young and vulnerable people in Greater Manchester - and comedian Jason Manford was even there.

Fans ran, walked, strolled and even pushed each other in wheelchairs during the event on Sunday.

Children were also able to visit St Nick himself at Santa's Grotto on the Campus, as well as meet Rudolph and all the other reindeer.

It must have been particularly easy for supporters to get into the festive spirit, seeing as Frank Lampard had netted the only goal in a 1-0 victory for the Premier League champions away at Leicester City on Saturday.
