A Virginia church has been inundated with responses after it posted a message on its Facebook page asking for a family to adopt an unborn baby with Down syndrome that would otherwise be aborted.

The Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Gainesville posted the appeal first thing Monday after its lead pastor Reverend Thomas Vander Woude begged the young mother - who is just shy of six months pregnant - and her partner to let him find an appropriate adoptive family.

When they agreed, he took to social media and was shocked when he received more than 900 responses in a day from families willing to adopt the child and raise it as their own. The parents are now interviewing three of those families with an adoption agency.

'When we got in and opened up around 9:30, it was nearly nonstop. All day long, we were receiving phone calls from people who wanted to adopt the baby,' church staff member Martha Drennan told The Washington Times. 'Father Vander Woude has gotten over 900 emails in regard to the baby.'

The note, posted by a volunteer who handles the church's social media pages on behalf of Vander Woude, stated: 'There is a couple in another state who have contacted an adoption agency looking for a family to adopt their Downs Syndrome unborn baby. If a couple has not been found by today they plan to abort the baby.

'If you are interested in adopting 
this baby please contact Fr. VW IMMEDIATELY. we are asking all to pray 
for this baby and the wisdom that this couple realize the importance of 
human life and do not abort this beautiful gift from God.'

The couple, who have not been identified, live in a state where abortion is prohibited after 24 weeks.

Given the mother was already almost six months pregnant, Vander Woude had only a short time to find appropriate adoptive parents.

But even the church was gob-smacked by the flood of offers, which came from all over the U.S. and across the globe including from England, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands.

'I think it is a wonderful use of social media, that word can so quickly get all over the country and even to foreign countries and that the people who see the value of life are stepping up and saying, "I will take that baby and raise that baby as mine,"' Drennan told The Times.

'It was a beautiful witness all day long that so many people wanted this child and believed in the dignity of that child - Downs syndrome or not.'
