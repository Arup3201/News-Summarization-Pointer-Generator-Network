Men might spend a lot of time bonding over a pint - but it doesn't often start on the school run.

Fathers Rolant Tomos and Rob Lilford from Llantwit Major, Glamorgan, who met after dropping their children off, will this week launch Tomos Lilford Brewery - and their very own brand of craft beers.

Mr Tomos, an electrician by
 trade, said: 'We agreed that, as the only men at the school gates, we 
should probably go for a coffee and a chat and we instantly hit it off.'

He added: 'We discovered that we had a lot in common, including an interest in home brewing.'

The pair hope that their beers will make a dent in the commercial market.

'I’ve always dreamed of owning a brewery, as every sensible young man does, and when I told Rolant about this he said he may be able to help with his experience as a business mentor.'

After two years of planning, tasting and pouring pints, the Tomos Lilford Brewery now produces four core ales - Rosemary Ale, Hay Ale, the Personal Best bitter and Trip-hop.

The company has been given a boost with £2,000 of grant funding from Creative Rural Communities, a local enterprise scheme.

The extra money has allowed the business partners to invest in new tanks and pay an advertising agency to develop their brand - they also recruited Mr Lilford's brother Rob for the team.

Their new logo features a cormorant - a large waterbird - and will be officially revealed on Saturday.

Mr Lilford said: 'As a coastal bird with 
no oil glands, it is the epitome of something which has survived and 
evolved against the odds - it isn’t waterproof but still dives and hunts
 for fish in order to survive.

Humble beginnings: The budding entrepreneurs have based their business in old cargo containers. The brewery now produces four core ales - Rosemary Ale, Hay Ale, the Personal Best bitter and Trip-hop

'We wanted something to represent adventures in beer and the bird depicts all the obstacles we had to overcome on the journey so far.'

Nia Hollins, of Creative Rural Communities, said: 'Tomos Lilford Brewery use plants grown and foraged within the Vale and work with rangers to find natural ingredients found along the Glamorgan heritage coastline.'

'It’s great to have Rob and Rolant on board as local food champions and we’re sure they’ll do very well in the future.'
