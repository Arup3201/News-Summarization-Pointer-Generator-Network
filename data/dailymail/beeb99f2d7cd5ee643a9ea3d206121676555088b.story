Harry Redknapp struggled to explain exactly what role Les Ferdinand would play at Queens Park Rangers following his appointment as head of football operations.

Ferdinand, a former QPR striker, was confirmed into his new role last week - a job that is understood to be similar to that of a director of football.

Redknapp has, in the past, openly admitted he could not work under a director of football.

Redknapp struggled to explain exactly what Ferdinand's role at Loftus Road would involve

Speaking in 2012, Redknapp said: 'It’s something that happens abroad – they have sporting directors and they choose the players but I couldn’t work under those circumstances.'

And on Friday, Redknapp insisted the decision to bring Ferdinand to Loftus Road was down to owner Tony Fernandes, though admitted he was consulted about the appointment.

Furthermore, when asked to explain what Ferdinand's job description was, Redknapp broke into a long silence before saying: 'Erm, I love Les, I get on great with Les.

Ferdinand has been described as an 'icon' by Redknapp for his goal scoring exploits at the club

Hoops owner Tony Fernandes was responsible for bringing in Ferdinand

'I’ve got a lot of time for Les. He’s just looking at the youth set-up and everything else.

'Tony wanted to bring him in. He’s an iconic figure at the club, he was a top player here. Tony felt he’d be good to have.

'That’s where we are at the moment, who knows where we will be next week. Who knows?

'Head of football operations, it’s a stupid title really, isn't it? I think he’ s just looking at the scouting and all that type of stuff. I speak to Les all the time, I’ve just had a cup of tea with him.

'I knew he was coming. The chairman asked me what I thought about Les and I said "I love him". Great lad.'

Redknapp was due to have dinner with Fernandes ahead of Sundays clash against Liverpool.

But Redknapp insisted he would not be seeking any assurances from the Malaysian businessman during Friday's meeting as uncertainty over his future persists.

A heavy defeat against Brendan Rodgers' side on Saturday would raise further question marks over his role at QPR, particularly after plans to offer him a new two-year contract were shelved by the club.

But Redknapp insists he is losing little sleep over his job prospects, saying: 'Will I beg Tony not to sack me at dinner? No. I wouldn’t beg anybody to do that.

'I'm not going to be there buying him dinner to keep my job - I will let him buy dinner! I don’t feel I’m under any pressure here. I don’t lie in bed at night worrying about.

On his new contract, he added: 'I wasn't bothered about signing a new contract. What are contracts? If you get the sack, you get whatever you get. Contracts mean nothing. I don't need assurances from anybody.'
