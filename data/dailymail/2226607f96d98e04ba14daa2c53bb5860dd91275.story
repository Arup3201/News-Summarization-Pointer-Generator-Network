JonBenet Ramsey's parents were indicted with child abuse charges resulting in her death - but the district attorney refused to prosecute them, newly-unsealed grand jury documents revealed today.

In the 1999 indictment, John and Patsy Ramsey were not directly accused of murdering their six-year-old daughter, who was found strangled and beaten in 1996, but were accused of putting her in a situation that ultimately led her to her death.

The couple were never charged because former District Attorney Alex Hunter refused to sign the document and prosecute them, saying there was insufficient evidence.

The grand jury documents released in Boulder, Colorado on Friday were compiled long 
before DNA evidence led the DA to 
publicly exonerate the Ramseys in 2008.

Loss: Six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was killed in 1996, was abused by her parents until she died, a grand jury concluded in 1999. But despite their indictment, her parents were not prosecuted over her death

'The
 DNA was not available to the grand jury in 1999,' Lin Wood, the 
Ramseys' attorney, told the Denver Post on Friday. 'What we have here is a release of a sliver of the 
evidence that the grand jury looked at and reviewed. It's just based on 
incomplete evidence.'

A 
reporter for The Camera and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the 
Press had filed a lawsuit to seek the records and the documents were 
released on Friday after a ruling by a Colorado judge.

In
 the four-page document, one of the counts read that they 'did 
unlawfully, knowingly, recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be 
unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the
 child's life or health, which resulted in the death of JonBenét 
Ramsey.'

Even though the 
grand jury voted to go ahead with the charges in 1999, the DA had 
declined to proceed over fears he could not prove guilt without a 
reasonable doubt, the Daily Camera reported.

The body of JonBenet, a child beauty queen, was found bludgeoned 
and strangled in her family's home in Boulder on December 26, 1996, hours after she was reported missing.

Indicted: John and Patsy Ramsey, who are pictured in 2004, were accused of putting their daughter in a situation that ultimately led to her death. Mrs Ramsey died from ovarian cancer in 2006

The parents of JonBenet Ramsey were both indicted with child abuse resulting in death and acting as an accessory to a crime by the grand jury in 1999.

On the child abuse charge, the grand jury wrote that John and Patsy Ramsey 'did unlawfully, knowingly, recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child's life or health, which resulted in the death of JonBenet Ramsey.'

On a second count of accessory to a crime, the grand jury wrote that each parent 'did render assistance to a person' with the intent to prevent their arrest or prosecution 'knowing they had committed and was suspected of the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death'

Her parents had called police to report her kidnapping and said they found a note demanding a ransom of $118,000 for her safe return.

After her death, her parents were 
placed under an 'umbrella of suspicion', an investigator said, but in 
2008, the DA said that evidence suggested 
the killer was a stranger, not a family member.

Two years earlier, Mrs Ramsey had died after a long battle with ovarian cancer.

The statute of limitations for the abuse charges expired in 2002.

The case has never been solved. If Ramsey had not been killed, she would now be 23.

The documents' release comes just days after 
JonBenet's father said he didn't want secret grand jury indictments from
 his daughter's case released to the public.

John
 Ramsey's attorneys had sent a letter to the Boulder County District 
Attorney saying the release of such records without releasing the entire
 grand jury record would only defame the parents.

'Public release of the allegations of 
an un-prosecuted indictment only serves to further defame (John Ramsey) 
and his late wife Patricia,' the letter said, according to the Daily Camera.

'Mr.
 Ramsey will have no access to whatever evidence the prosecutors 
presented to the grand jury and will have no ability to disprove those 
allegations in a court of law.

'Nor will the public have any ability 
to evaluate the propriety of the indictment unless the entire grand jury
 record is unsealed and opened to public view.'

But the judge ordered the current DA to 
provide a reason why the documents should be kept secret. He provided them to a judge on Tuesday to determine if they were
 suitable to be released.

Officials told Mr Ramsey that they would only release the secret indictments in such a way that would not hinder potential future prosecution under charges where the statute of limitations has not yet expired.

The judge also said that the court would not be permitted to release all of the information in the case.

'The court is sympathetic to the position of Mr. Ramsey,; Judge Robert Lowenbach said on Wednesday, but a release of the entire record "would set a precedent that would impede other Grand Juries in performing their functions under statute and rule'.
