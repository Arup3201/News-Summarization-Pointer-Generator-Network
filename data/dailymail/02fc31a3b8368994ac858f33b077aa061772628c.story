Samsung is due to release a smartwatch that can send texts and make calls without having to sync to a smartphone.

The South Korean company plans to unveil the smartwatch over the next few months in a bid to take a larger slice of the wearable technology market.

The unnamed smartwatch will be able to take photos, send emails, monitor the wearer’s heart rate and use GPS tracking, according to sources close to the company.

Samsung has declined to say what the device will be called, how much it will cost or whether a user will make calls by holding the watch close to his or her mouth.

But the group is currently in talks with carriers in the U.S., South Korea and Europe about its plans, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Samsung already has four smartwatches on the market, including the Galaxy Gear, powered by Google's Android operating system, and the Gear 2.

But all of these devices need to connect to a smartphone to make calls connect to the internet.

The new system is expected to be the first standalone watch-phone system from a major manufacturer. Analysts expect the device to run on the Tizen operating system.

Market research firm IDC expects shipments of wearable devices, such as smartwatches, to triple this year to more than 19 million units.

The group said smartphone sales are expected to increase 19 per cent this year to 1.2 billion units.

Apple, Samsung's closest competitor in smartphones, is expected to launch its own smartwatch later this year.

Samsung could be on the verge of entering the virtual reality race, if reports about an upcoming headset are true.

The Korean firm is said to have sent early prototypes to developers to test, and the final product could launch by the end of the year.

Sources close to Samsung told Engadget the headsets have OLED screens and will connect with the next generation of Galaxy devices.

The reports suggest the headset will run on Android, rather than the Tizen operating system most recently seen on Samsung’s latest smartwatches.

Engadget added the headset is also likely to connect to a phone or tablet using wires, to prevent a lag when playing games.

The release date, price and other features were not revealed, but it does differ from the rumoured Galaxy Glass project, first reported on in October.

Variations of virtual reality have been around for years, particularly in flight and driving simulators, but it's popularity has risen recently due to companies such as Oculus VR.

Its Oculus Rift headset began life as a Kickstarter project and was bought by Facebook earlier this year in a deal said to be worth around $2 billion. A consumer version is expected later this year.
