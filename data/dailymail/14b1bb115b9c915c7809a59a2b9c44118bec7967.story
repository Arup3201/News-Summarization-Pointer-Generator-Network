Hull striker Yannick Sagbo is a target for Bastia. 

The French club are keen to sign a new striker and Hull will sell Sagbo who has been on the periphery this season featuring just six times. 

Bastia are also interested in West Ham attacker Modibo Maiga who has fallen out with Metz manager Albert Cartier and is set to cut short his loan agreement.

Sagbo signed a three-month loan deal with Championship side Wolves in September, and was scheduled to stay with the club until January. He was recalled by Hull in November.

He scored just four goals for the Tigers last year after a £1.6million move from French side Evian.

Sagbo has struggled to get time on the pitch, and is yet to score this season.
