England were celebrating an unlikely victory deep in the Sri Lankan jungle  – but for Alastair Cook it may have come at a price.

While the tourists were rejoicing in a desperately needed win that closes the deficit to 2-1 and breathes life into a side that had been inviting ridicule, their captain was waiting to hear if he would face a one-match ban for England’s slow over-rate.

As Sri Lanka ran up 242 for eight in a game shortened by a biblical downpour to 35 overs a side, Cook’s team were 18 minutes off the pace. Fined for the same offence against India at Cardiff in August, he could now be banned for Sunday’s crucial game in Colombo.

‘We’ll plead our case,’ he said. ‘It was tough on that big ground with the ball going everywhere at the end, and it takes a long time for batsmen to come out to the middle.’

ICC match referee David Boon may take a different view. And if Cook is banned for a game, it will raise the question of whether the captaincy passes to Eoin Morgan, who continued his wretched run here by falling on the hook for a single.

Right now, he hardly looks in the frame of mind to score meaningful runs, let alone lead his country. England’s get-out clause may be that there is no official vice-captain on this tour, in which case Joe Root could come into the picture.

That, though, is a bridge England will cross at some point over the next few days. For now, they can simply enjoy reacquainting themselves with the unfamiliar scent of victory – only their second in nine completed matches.

Cook himself produced another innings that was neither one thing nor the other, and his 42-ball 34 ended with a tame drive to the keeper. But England will be quietly thrilled at yet another glittering knock from Moeen Ali, and with the composure shown by Root and Jos Buttler after a brief wobble.

As Cook put it: ‘A side full of confidence would have done it easier than we did.’

Having raced to 50 in 21 balls during the first warm-up game, Ali got there in 25 in the first one-day international, and 29 here. If he’s slowing down, he’s doing it in style: his innings here included five effortless sixes.

It helped that the boundaries at Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium had been brought in, but this was still carefree batting of the highest order. 

‘The Beard That’s Feared’ has made the transition from a marketing gimmick at Worcestershire to a statement of fact at the highest level.

England being England, they almost made a mess of it. After Cook and his opening partner had put on 84 inside 12 overs, Alex Hales – finally given a chance at the expense of Ian Bell – was culpable in the run-out of Ali.

Hales was then caught tamely at mid-on after a promising 27 in 29 balls, before Ravi Bopara – promoted to No 5 – and Morgan both fell cheaply to leave England 152 for five.

Root was caught off a Prasad no-ball on 40, but the eventual ease of England’s triumph – completed with eight deliveries to spare, with Buttler rediscovering his touch in an unbeaten 55 from 37 balls – will persuade them they can still get something out of this seven-match series.

Sri Lanka’s innings had been rebuilt from 31 for three by a run-a-ball stand of 87 between two of the world game’s in-form batsmen, Kumar Sangakkara and Angelo Mathews, before both fell to the recalled Chris Jordan.

Sangakkara became the fourth player to pass 13,000 one-day runs on his way to a typically classy 63 off 62 balls, before Lahiru Thirimanne and tailender Dhammika Prasad helped crash 62 off the last five overs.

Chris Woakes picked up three wickets, but Bopara was again underbowled – sending down only three overs – and Ben Stokes looked worryingly devoid of rhythm and confidence. His two overs cost 28; so far in the series, he has sent down six wicketless overs for 64.

Stokes played here instead of James Tredwell. It’s hard to imagine the off-spinner not returning in Colombo. 

England will head to the capital with an unexpected spring in their step.
