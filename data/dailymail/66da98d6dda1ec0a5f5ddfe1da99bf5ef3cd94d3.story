First came the leopard-print kitten heels. Then it was the black patent knee-high boots.

But this time, Theresa May’s shoes were making a rather more pointed statement.

The Home Secretary arrived for a Cabinet meeting yesterday wearing eye-catching spiked pumps.

Eye-catching accessories: Theresa May wore a pair of studded pumps and leopard-print gloves as she strolled to No. 10 for a Cabinet meeting

Her otherwise sombre outfit meant it was 
hard to miss her studded shoes – not to mention her leopard-print gloves
 – as she strolled to No. 10.

The 57-year-old is known for her love of quirky fashion, and last year Debenhams credited the ‘Theresa May effect’ with helping their leopard-print pumps outsell plain black ones by three to one.

Liz Hemmings, stylist at Femail, said: ‘Mrs May’s shoes are catching up with one of last year’s must-have fashion trends – that is studs on clothing and footwear.

'Even Marks & Spencer is now selling studded clothing, including a studded suede slipper shoe similar to Mrs May’s.

‘As for her gloves, animal prints have been fashionable for several years but are still part of many of this season’s hottest collections.

‘As far as MPs go, Theresa May has a reputation for being at the height of fashion, going where others would fear to tread.’
