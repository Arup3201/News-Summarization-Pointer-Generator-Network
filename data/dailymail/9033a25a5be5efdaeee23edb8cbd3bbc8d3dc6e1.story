It would be stretching things a bit to suggest that Liverpool ended 2014 with the same swagger they possessed 12 months ago.

But after a year of two vastly contrasting halves - one might call it an annus hammer-horribilis given how regularly Liverpool battered their opponents to begin with - Brendan Rodgers will be relieved to see his side again displaying the predatory instincts that enabled them to mount that ‘unexpected title challenge’.

More pleasing still for Liverpool’s manager will be the fact that they crushed Swansea City in the absence of Steven Gerrard as well as Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge. Finally these players appeared capable of taking responsibility without their talismanic captain at their side, dominating their opponents in the way a Liverpool team should at Anfield.

Rodgers will take particular pleasure in the sight of Adam Lallana delivering his finest performance to date in a Liverpool shirt, one marked by two goals but also a demonstration of the ability that justifies the price tag.

But Rodgers should also see enormous positives in the contributions of Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson, not to mention Alberto Moreno, who scored the opening goal as well as excelling in his wingback role.

It remains fair to say that Liverpool would have completed this year rather less optimistic than they were when they entered it. But this was a second win in as many games, and secured thanks to that opening strike from Moreno, Lallana’s brace - one comically inadvertent, the other brilliant - and an own goal from Jonjo Shelvey that was not even the low point of his performance. For Shelvey, the nadir was an elbow in the face of Emre Can that escaped punishment but is sure to lead to retrospective FA action.

Of course, Rodgers still has concerns. Simon Mignolet returned from an ‘indefinite’ spell on the sidelines - it actually lasted only four games because of the injury suffered by Brad Jones - without making a mistake but clearly there is a lack of confidence.

In addition, the continued deployment of Raheem Sterling as a centre forward does not reflect well on Rodgers when it means Mario Balotelli and Ricky Lambert are sitting on the bench. Considering how badly Sterling struggled against a physical Swansea defence, Sturridge cannot return soon enough.

The England forward’s frustration showed through when he threw a slap at Federico Fernandez in the second half - an indiscretion which might also attract the attention of the FA’s discipline department.

Liverpool were helped by the fact that Swansea showed neither defensive cohesion nor urgency, which was strange given their recent efforts. Their only contribution of note in a distinctly one-sided half was proof from Shelvey that he had not heeded the warning of Garry Monk, who told him to stop getting himself needlessly booked.

Monk’s side had no answer to the work ethic Liverpool showed here last night. Moreno’s 33rd-minute opener proved what can come with a bit of hard graft, the fact that he continued his run from out wide after passing to Lallana being rewarded with a fine cross from Henderson. Lukasz Fabianski had made a number of saves by then but he could do nothing to deny Moreno from close range.

Swansea’s only response was that moment of madness by Shelvey. In fact only after spending the interval with Monk did they show any signs of improvement.

But a further setback would come in the 51st minute when Lallana’s reward for his endeavour was a goal, albeit one that came when Fabianski hit his clearance against the advancing Liverpool forward and then watched in despair as the ball spun back over his head and bounced into Swansea’s goal.

In fairness to the Welsh side, they did then hit back when Mamadou Sakho, under pressure from the otherwise ineffective Wilfried Bony, diverted a Wayne Routledge cross into the path of Gylfi Sigurdsson.

But in a frantic 10-minute spell that saw Sterling send an effort against a post, Lallana struck again. His second goal came after he collected a delightful flick on from Coutinho, beat two players and guided a marvellous finish beyond the reach of Fabianski. Shelvey then won a near-post tussle with Lallana from a Henderson corner, only to send a glancing header over his own goalkeeper. Monk’s misery was indeed complete.

But on a night when the master and apprentice were reunited on the touchline, even Monk might concede this was exactly what his former Swansea mentor needed.

It has been a tough few months for Rodgers, leaving him under enormous pressure and proving how quickly fortunes, even for a manager who finished second in the league last season, can change.

The year has certainly ended better than Rodgers perhaps feared it would.
