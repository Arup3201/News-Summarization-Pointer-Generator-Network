To passers-by, the pub’s decorations may seem a little understated. 

But for those who venture inside, The Hanging Gate more than makes up for it.

With 27,000 twinkling lights and 6,000 sparkling baubles, it claims to be the pub with the most Christmas decorations in Britain. 

The Hanging Gate pub considers itself Britain's most festive public house with more 6,000 baubles and 27,000 lights adorning its dining rooms this Christmas 

Everything is held in place with 8,000 metres of wire and 40,000 staples.

Mark Thomas, 41, landlord of the pub in Chapel-en-le-Frith, in the Peak District, said: ‘We finished putting them up last week. It took three of the girls three weeks to put everything up.

'It all started twenty five years ago. We started with a good display – but it was nothing like this. Each year we put up a few more things and more customers come. 

'There’s different themes and colours in each room. This year we’e got candy canes in the main room, a purple room and an indoor igloo.' 

Waitress Sophie Parkes-Morgan, 19, who helped put up the decorations, said: 'I spend all day banging my head on the baubles and they get tangled in my hair too. 

'But I think they’re amazing. It’s worth it just to see everyone’s faces.

'It normally takes about three or four days to take them all down again. We get quite a lot of snow around here so that can delay things a bit.' 

The pub in Chapel-en-le-Frith in the Peak District attracts hundreds of diners over the festive period 

 While most come to admire the decorations, some have been known to be eaten by children or be stolen

‘It’s worth it just to see everyone’s faces. 

Mr Thomas said: ‘Our customers just love it – from Monday we’re almost fully-booked every day until Christmas.’ 

He admits to re-using a lot of decorations – but this year topped up with £4,000 of new lights and baubles. 

All in, he believes there are around £25,000 of decorations. ‘I don’t think there’s another pub that’s even close to what we've got,’ he added.

While the majority of diners who flock to the 170-seat restaurant are happy enough to admire the festivities, others can't keep their hands off the dazzling display.

'Children sometimes try to eat the candy canes. And we’ve had a few things pinched in the past. 

'One year someone took a reindeer on the bus and it turned up in a nightclub in Buxton.'
