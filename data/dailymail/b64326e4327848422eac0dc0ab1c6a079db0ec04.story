A gunman who carried out the 'cold-blooded execution' of a sleeping man as he lay alongside his girlfriend and his young son has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 30 years.

Father-of-three Lee Gray, 32, was killed with a single bullet to the back of the head fired by Martin Fieldhouse, 29, in a case of mistaken identity.

Fieldhouse intended to kill his brother Michael who had knocked him out cold in a fight a few hours earlier and towards whom he felt 'sheer hatred'.

As the guilty murder verdict was announced by the jury foreman at Sheffield Crown Court, Michael Fieldhouse, who was in the public gallery, shouted 'yes' and clapped and grinned at his brother in the dock.

Martin Fieldhouse shouted back: 'I will see you in jail one day.' Michael responded: 'I f***ing hope so.'

Fuelled by drink, cocaine and cannabis, Martin Fieldhouse sneaked into Mr Gray’s home at 6.30am and expected to find Michael who had temporarily been sleeping in the conservatory, the court heard.

When he was not there he crept upstairs and in the darkness saw a man’s body in a bedroom and wrongly assumed it was his brother.

He shot Mr Gray with a .410 sawn-off single barreled shotgun as he slept with his girlfriend Keeley Jones, 27, and his three-year-old son between them.

Neither Miss Jones or the boy were awoken by the sound of the shot because it was muffled by being fired in direct contact with Mr Gray’s skull.

After the murder, Mr Fieldhouse contacted his ex-partner to help him dispose of the gun and he admitted that 'he had shot his brother Mick.'

After the hearing Michael Fieldhouse, 35, a father-of-three said: 'I’m really pleased for his mum Annette, 53. She wouldn’t come to the trial and has washed her hands of him. She never wants to see him again.

'I think he did it out of jealousy. I
have given that kid everything such as money but we have never seen eye
to eye for a long time.

'I hoped we would be close one day but now it will never happen.

'I don’t hate him, I just feel sorry for him. I was heading back to the house and would have been in the conservatory but changed my mind and went to see a girlfriend in Wakefield.

'If I had gone there I would now be dead instead of my best mate. Lee was my fishing and drinking and gym partner. We did everything together. I feel like I have lost a brother in Lee.

'I hope Martin rots in prison. I never want to see him again. I shouted I hoped to see him inside because if I did get in there I would smash him to bits.

'Martin’s girlfriend had been saying for a year he wanted to kill me. He thinks he’s a big man but he’s not. The whole family will cut him off now. He won’t get any family visiting him inside.'

Martin Fieldhouse, of, Athersley South, Barnsley had denied murdering Mr Gray at his home in Worsbrough Dale, Barnsley on March 5, 2011.

He claimed it was his brother who killed Mr Gray in a dispute over an £80,000 drug debt owed by Mr Gray but the jury at Sheffield Crown Court found Martin guilty.

He also said Michael Fieldhouse tried to 
persuade Mr Gray to having been the driver of a car involved in a 
near-fatal collision the previous evening to wipe the debt clear and 
when Mr Gray refused, Michael Fieldhouse decided to kill him.

The
court heard that the Fieldhouses had a stormy relationship over many 
years. They are half brothers and Martin Fieldhouse said his brother 
used to give him serious beatings and their mother viewed Martin as the 
'golden boy' of the family.

There had been a major falling-out after
Martin Fieldhouse claimed his brother had slept with his girlfriend who
was 'the only girl he ever loved' and Michael or someone on his behalf 
had once shot him in the stomach.

Investigation: Police cordoned off the scene after the fatal shooting in Worsborough, South Yorkshire, where Lee Gray was found with a gunshot wound to the head

Despite a brief reconciliation, the Fieldhouse brothers fought outside a nightclub and Martin was knocked out cold. Just a few hours later he armed himself and drove to Mr Gray’s house, entering through the unlocked conservatory door.

He shot Mr Gray once to the back of the head before leaving 
the house and driving off at speed.

Martin Fieldhouse afterwards told a friend: 'I’ve gone and shot our Mick'. He said he had found his brother in bed with Miss Jones and shot him.

The murder was only discovered when Keeley Jones woke up and rang the emergency services at 6.57am.

Miss Jones told the court: 'I did not hear a gunshot'. She sensed a burning smell and awoke to find her lover covered in blood. She only found out from the police later that he had been shot.

She said: 'I couldn’t believe it. With him being in a car crash it could have been a haemorrhage or someone might have bashed him on the head.'

A firearms expert concluded that the 
firing of the gun in contact with the head 'could result in a 
significant reduction in the noise of the discharge with the skull 
acting as an effective expansion chamber for the discharge gases.'

Michael Fieldhouse told the court he was in bed with a girlfriend at the time of the murder.

He said of Martin: 'He has always been a bum. Nobody liked him, nobody ever has.'

Martin Fieldhouse claimed in police 
interviews that he had been shot in the stomach 
with a shot gun in 2006 'either by or on behalf of his brother.'

Judge Mr Justice Simon said the murder was pre-planned and the victim was asleep in bed at the time.

He told Martin Fieldhouse: 'You were so hyped up you scarcely noticed who you were shooting and mistook Lee Gray for your brother.

'You intended the cold-blooded execution of your brother and you carried out the cold-blooded execution of Lee Gray against whom you had no grudge.'

The intended target was actually the alleged shooter's brother, as the two family members shared years of animosity and violence
