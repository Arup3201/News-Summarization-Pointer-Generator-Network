Ed Balls has been spared a driving ban but fined £900 and given five points on his licence today for failing to stop after an accident.

The Shadow Chancellor revealed in May he had been charged with driving away from a crash after he bumped his car in his constituency of Morley and Outwood, West Yorkshire.

It was said he was trying to perform a 'seven point turn'. 

Today, a district judge said the incident was 'at the lower end of the scale of seriousness' and rejected the option of a total driving ban.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has been ordered to pay a £900 fine and has had five points put on his driving licence after admitting failing to stop after a minor road collision

District Judge Roy Anderson read a letter from Mr Balls's solicitors admitting the offences of failing to stop and failing to report an accident.

He said Mr Balls's account was that he did not realise at the time that he had caused any damage to the parked Peugeot 308 as he moved out of the car park in his Ford Mondeo.

The district judge ordered the shadow chancellor to pay a £900 fine plus a £90 Government surcharge and £85 prosecution costs.

Mr Anderson said: 'Motorists who leave the scene of accidents without stopping to exchange particulars will, in serious cases, face a penalty which includes disqualification from driving.

'This, however, is a case very much at the lower end of the scale of seriousness.

'No injury was caused to any person and the damage to the car was, in reality, very slight.

'While Mr Balls was careless to a minor degree in colliding with the parked car, it's quite clear that if he had stopped at the time to exchange details, this matter would never have been the subject of criminal proceedings.'

Earlier, Mr Anderson was told the offences carried a possible prison sentence.

Smiling, the district judge said: 'I have been sent a bundle of paperwork and, having read it, that would be a most unlikely penalty.'

In a blog post on his website, Mr Balls, who did not attend the hearing at Leeds Magistrates' Court today, said he bumped into another car when trying to turn his car round 'in a tight spot'.

It happened as he was moving out of a car park next to the Labour Unity Club, in Morley.

But instead of alerting the owner of the damaged black Peugeot 306, Mr Balls drove off. He said that he had no idea he had caused any damage.

The offence of failing to stop after an accident can mean five to 10 penalty points, driving disqualification, a fine of up to £5,000 or, in the most serious cases, a jail sentence of up to six months.  

Pictures at the time showed Mr Balls' ageing Ford Mondeo estate clearly showing scratch marks on the bumper, but his spokesman insisted they were the result of police taking a paint sample from the vehicle.

Mr Balls said he only found out that he had damaged the other motor when he was contacted by officers a week later.

Mr Balls also claimed the police had no choice but to charge him and insisted he accepted it fully. 

That bump in April was the fourth time in recent years that Mr Balls has landed himself in trouble behind the wheel.

In 2013, he received three points for driving through a red light on the Embankment near Westminster in London.

The same year he was caught speeding in his constituency in West Yorkshire. He was clocked driving at 56mph in a 50mph zone.

Mr Balls paid a fine and attended a speed awareness course rather than accept penalty points.

And in 2010, the Labour heavyweight admitted 'stupidity' after being caught talking on his mobile phone while driving.

As a cabinet minister at the time, he was fined £60 and given three points on his licence - although these points have now expired.
