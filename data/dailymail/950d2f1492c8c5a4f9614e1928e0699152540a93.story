Australian-based Tongan boxer Lomalito Moala said the attention he received at the Commonwealth Games after he wore a Celtic Football shirt to the Opening Ceremony has inspired him to turn professional.

The 25-year-old donned the shirt at the Opening Ceremony and had become an internet superstar in football-mad Glasgow, with Celtic are the top team and inspire a devoted followers.

While winning a gold medal was all that was on his mind before the games, that changed after he donned the shirt after asking for 100 retweets on Twitter.

The Sydney boxer posted on his Twitter account before the Opening Ceremony: 'Get me 100+ retweets I will carry the Celtic Jersey opening ceremony.'

As promised, he made his way out onto the stage at Celtic Park, waving the shirt in front of 40,000 fans before putting it over his traditional Tongan 'Ta'ovala' dress.

The bronze medallist, who won the lightweight 60kg boxing at New Delhi in 2010, told Daily Mail Australia that the stunt has inspired him to turn professional.

'I was always thinking about the right time to turn professional, but I always put my amateur goals first and with the guidance of my close family and friends, I think my time with amateur boxing is coming to an end,’ Moala said.

‘After leaving Glasgow, it has made me rethink my decisions on amateur boxing and strategically, I would make a stronger and more dominate impact in the professional ranks with the style of boxing I have. I know I can make more of a positive mark on my own with the support of my followers.’

The light welterweight boxer, who attended Cabramatta High School in Sydney's southwest, didn't end up fighting at the games because he was 600 grams over the 64kg weigh limit before the games.

'I weighed 100kg three months out from the Games, and went into a strict training regime to get myself back in shape.

'I always believed that I would make the weight cut off as I've made them previously. I trained up until the weigh in and didn’t eat or drink for three days to make sure I would drop the last kilo. But the morning of the weigh in, I was 64.6kg.

‘I know some would think how could 600 grams not be dropped? But after spending some time in a sauna and training all morning, I knew my body was in some dangerously dehydrated state.

‘Although I didn’t make the weight, I am more humbled by the experience and I have learnt more about myself and my body than I ever did,' he said.

While he may not have managed to compete in the Commonwealth Games, he entertained himself and his new followers with pictures and video of himself walking the streets of Glasgow in a Celtic shirt.

Moala was officially invited by Celtic FC officials on Twitter to attend the Champions League match against KR Reykjavik at Murrayfield.

Moala's pre-ceremony Tweet started as a joke but within an hour he'd been retweeted 750 times.

'I didn't do it to spite Tonga or to make headlines and I didn't think it would explode and have this impact on people but I have no regrets about the stunt.

‘I chose to represent Celtic purely because I wanted to pay my respects to the host city of the Commonwealth Games. I grew up following Australia’s Scott McDonald, which was how I got into the team.

'I knew before I got to Glasgow that I would buy a Celtic jersey and then everything else that followed after, was purely fortunate.'

'I had to refresh my page a few times because I thought there was a glitch. I couldn’t believe the amount of people following me and how much support they gave. It was amazing! I only have two words - Hail Hail!’
