Fire has destroyed a home owned by the man who is accused of killing a Food Network star and her husband and arson investigators have ruled it suspicious.

The double-wide trailer, which is on the property belonging to Robert Jason Owens in Leicester, North Carolina, burned down last Friday. It is about 50 yards from the house where Owens lived, but was not being used as a residence, investigators say. 

Crews were called to the blaze about 2am. By the time they arrived, it had burned almost entirely to the ground.  

The trailer burned to the ground about 2am on Friday. It was not being lived in by Robert Jason Owens, who is charged with two murders

Arson investigators have not said what caused the fire, but have ruled it suspicious

Owens has been behind bars since March 16, charged with murdering Cristie Schoen Codd and her husband JT Codd. Mrs Codd had appeared on the reality show 'Food Network Stars' in 2012

Owens has been behind bars since March 16, when he was arrested for the murders of pregnant Cristie Schoen Codd and her husband Joseph 'JT' Codd. 

Codd, a caterer who was five months pregnant, was a contestant on season eight of 'Food Network Star' in 2012. 

Detectives say that Owens, a contractor who did some work on the Codds' home, murdered the Codds and then 'stored and destroyed' their bodies. 

The sheriff's department revealed on Friday - just hours after the fire - that investigators had found the victims' remains in a wood stove on his property.

Authorities would not say whether the stove was in the trailer that burned down or in Owens' other home. 

'It sure does raise a lot of questions, and it would not be truthful to say that it didn't. But we don't know what we have with that and we continue to work through that and process that scene,' Sheriff Van Duncan told WLOS-TV. 

Authorities will not say whether they've determined a cause for the fire.  

A neighbor told the TV station that she fears the fire could mean Owens had an accomplice who is helping him to cover up the crime - even while he sits behind bars awaiting a murder trial.
