Edin Dzeko has hit out at the referee that wrongly disallowed his first half strike as offside.

Bosnia & Herzegovina were robbed of the first goal of the game after 21 minutes 
when Dzeko timed his run to perfection to convert a clever through pass 
by Miralem Pjanic.

But referee Peter O'Leary, from New Zealand, ruled the goal out after seeing his linesman's flag signal the Man City forward as offside. And, according to the Guardian, Dzeko was enraged with the decision after his side were eliminated from the tournament.

The accused: Referee Peter O'Leary was criticised for ruling the goal out

'The referee was shameful,' he said. 'We are going home and we are sad because of that but this referee should be going home too.

'He changed the result and he changed the game. That’s why we lost.'

To add insult to injury, it took just eight minutes from the incident for Nigeria to take the lead, as Stoke forward Peter Odemwingie converted to make the score 1-0.

The European side pushed on in the second half to try and find an equaliser, but their efforts were in vain as they fell to their second defeat in two games.

And Dzeko missed a host of chances, including hitting the post in injury time, as his side became the fifth team to be eliminated from the 2014 World Cup - after Cameroon, Australia, Spain and England.

'It was obviously a foul on our captain,' he added. 'And before when I scored the goal, it was never offside. We fought till the end but we didn’t have luck today.'

Bosnia & Herzegovina will now go into their final game against Iran with only pride to play for as their first ever World cup campaign comes to an end.
