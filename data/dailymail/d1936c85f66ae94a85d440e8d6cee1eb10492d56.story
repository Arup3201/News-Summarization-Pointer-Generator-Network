Search teams will 'stop listening for pings' from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's black box unless new signals are picked up, it has been revealed.

Ten planes and 14 ships were scouring around 16,000 square miles of the Indian Ocean today in a bid to locate the device before its emergency beacons fade. 

But a U.S. Navy captain has said they could 'give up' on the acoustic search following two days without a ping.

'When the time is right, we’ll 
say "Yes, the beacons have probably stopped transmitting" and it’s time 
to shift,' Captain Mark Matthews told ABC News.

He added that the team wanted a 'few more days' to try and narrow down the underwater search  area, saying: 'As
 long as we have a chance to receive another signal from the beacon, 
we’re going to try.'

Capt Matthews is in charge of the towed pinger locator (TPL-25) - that detects black box signals - and the Bluefin-21 underwater autonomous vehicle. Both are currently on board the Royal Australian Navy Ship Ocean Shield.

Moving on: U.S. Navy captain, Mark Matthews (above), said: 'When the time is right, we'll say "Yes, the beacons have probably stopped transmitting"'

He said that after 'giving up' the 'pinger' search, the navy would 'shift' to the Bluefin-21, which uses sonar to map around 12 square miles of ocean floor every day.

It comes just days after a fifth ping 
was detected around 1,500 miles north west of Perth, in western Australia.

The signal was captured on Thursday by a Royal 
Australian Air Force Orion P-3 aircraft, which had been dropping sonar buoys into the water at the time.

The
 buoys each have a hydrophone listening device that dangles about 300 
metres (1,000 feet) below the surface and their data are sent via radio 
back to a plane, Royal Australian Navy Commodore Peter Leavy said.

However, Angus Houston, who is 
coordinating the search for the plane, later said in a statement that an 
initial assessment had determined the signal was not related to an 
aircraft black box.

Last Saturday, two sounds detected by the TPL-25 were found to be consistent with the signals emitted from aircraft black boxes - flight data and cockpit voice recorders. And a further two 'pings' were picked up on Tuesday.

However, no 'credible' signals have been heard since, Capt Matthews said.

It has now been five weeks since the Boeing 777 mysteriously vanished as it flew from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing with 239 people on board on March 8.

As time passes, the signals from its black box's locator beacons continue to fade, while the data it contains could be lost forever if its month-long battery dies. 

Finding the black boxes after the 
batteries fail will be extremely difficult because the water in the area
 is 4,500 metres (15,000 feet) deep.

New method: Capt Matthews said after 'giving up' the 'pinger' search, the American navy would 'shift' to the Bluefin-21 (pictured being hoisted on board Ocean Shield). The vehicle uses sonar to map the ocean floor

The search for the missing jet involves a staggering array of sophisticated ships, aircraft and equipment, with eight countries contributing 17 vessels and 19 aircraft – including British nuclear submarine HMS Tireless.

Today, it emerged that the co-pilot of missing flight MH370 made a call from his mobile phone while the aircraft flew low over the west coast of Malaysia.

Investigators have learned that the call 
was made from Fariq Abdul Hamid's mobile phone as the Boeing 777 flew 
low near the island of Penang, on the north of Malaysia's west coast.

Operation: Today, it emerged that co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid (left) made a call from his mobile as the aircraft flew low over the west coast of Malaysia. Right, HMS Echo, which has arrived in the southern Indian Ocean

Despite the call ending abrupty, it has 
been learned that contact was definitely established with a 
telecommunications sub-station in Penang state.

The revelation came as the U.S. denied reports the plane landed at a military base on the remote island of Diego Garcia.

Yesterday, it looked like the black box may had been located deep in the Indian Ocean.

Perth
 radio station 6PR tweeted the discovery, citing aviation expert 
Geoffrey Thomas, who revealed the flight recorder had finally been found
 more than a month after the Boeing 777 went missing.

Australia's Prime Minister Tony 
Abbott, who is in China, said searchers were 'very confident' the signals
 detected were from the black box were from MH370.

'I
 really don't want to give any more information than that at this 
stage...as a sign of respect to the Chinese people and their families,' he said.

Speaking
 from Shanghai, China, Mr Abbott added that the discovery was a huge
 step in solving the mystery - and even claimed that officials believe 
they can now pinpoint the position of the missing black box flight 
recorder to ‘within some kilometres’.

'This is probably the most difficult search in human history,' he said. 'Among tragedy, however, there is hope. We are confident we know the position of the black box to the nearest kilometre.

However, Mr Abbott has not commented on the discovery since.

At present, investigators
 believe the Malaysian Airlines jet went down in the southern Indian Ocean based on a 
flight path calculated from its contacts with a satellite and analysis 
of its speed and fuel capacity.

Malaysia's
 government has now begun to investigate civil aviation and military 
authorities to determine why opportunities to identify and track 
Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 were missed in the chaotic hours after it
 vanished, two officials said.

In
 an interview with Reuters last weekend, Malaysia Airlines Chief 
Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said internal enquiries were under way, 
although he declined to give details.

Malaysia's opposition coalition has demanded a parliamentary inquiry into what happened on the ground in those first few hours.

Government officials have said any formal inquiry should not begin until the flight's black box recorders are found.
