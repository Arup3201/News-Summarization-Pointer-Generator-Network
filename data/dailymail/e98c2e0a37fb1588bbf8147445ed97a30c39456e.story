Prime Minister Tony Abbott has briefed parliament about the Malaysia Airlines crash in eastern Ukraine, telling MPs it looks less like an accident than a crime.

'This is a grim day for our country and it's a grim day for our world,' he said.

The government has confirmed 27 Australians were on board Flight MH17 which was carrying 298 people. All are feared dead.

The aircraft was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it crashed in rebel-held east Ukraine in what has been described as a 'terrorist' attack.

Mr Abbott said the plane appeared to have been brought down by Russian-backed rebels.

'As things stand this looks less like an accident than a crime.

'And if so the perpetrators must be brought to justice.'

Mr Abbott said Australia would work at the UN Security Council for a binding resolution to set up a full and impartial investigation.

'With full access to the site, with full access to the debris, with full access to the black box, and with full access to individuals who might be in a position to shed light on this terrible event,' he said.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop will summon the Russian ambassador to seek a categoric assurance of full co-operation from the Russian government.

'We owe it to the dead and their families, we owe it to the peace and stability of the wider world to establish the facts and we will do all we humanly can to bring that about,' she said.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the news was 'worse than shocking'.

'This is a violation of the rules of civilisation,' he said.

Mr Shorten said he had spoken to the Malaysian high commissioner on Friday.

'It is truly a tragic day in a tragic year for Malaysia.'

MPs stood in silence as a sign of respect for the victims.

On Friday evening, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mohd Najib Tun Razak wrote on Twitter that he had conveyed his condolences to Mr Abbott.

'I conveyed my condolences to @TonyAbbottMHR on the loss of Australian lives on board #MH17. Appreciate his support for us in trying times,' he wrote.
