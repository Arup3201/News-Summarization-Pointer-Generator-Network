A dangerous SnapChat-branded drug has left eight users in hospital in Darwin.

Four people were hospitalised from effects of the pills on Friday night alone – the second time in just seven days the drug's users have been rushed to hospital.

News of the batch of drug, nicknamed SnapChat, emerged last weekend ahead of the Summer Sessions music festival.

Police warn the pill, sold in either pink or blue with green speckles, is popular with teenagers

Named after the smartphone photo-messaging app, Snapchat, the pill is sold in either pink or blue with green speckles and has the app’s ghost logo pressed on the top of the tablet, which has become popular with teenagers.

Police are expressing grave concern about the drug, which is causing people to behave in an erratic and irrational manner and causing aggressive and disoriented behaviour.

Drug and Organised Crime Division Superintendent Clint Sims said taking any illicit drug is dangerous and potentially deadly.

‘These drugs are not produced under pharmaceutical conditions and the reality is people have no idea what they are taking or worse, what affect it will have on them,’ he told MailOnline.

‘The adverse and aggressive reactions people experience also places enormous pressure on emergency services.’

Police urge anyone who may have ingested the drug to seek medical treatment.
