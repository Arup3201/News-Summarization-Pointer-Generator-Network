Take That has become the latest band to snub Spotify by cutting a deal with Google for the internet giant to exclusively stream its new album.

The group has teamed up with Google Play Music to enable their new release, called III, to be streamed via the company as of Monday when it goes on sale.

Although Spotify remains the single largest digital music streaming service, it has been heavily criticised in recent weeks for the level of financial returns it offers artists.

Earlier this month Taylor Swift removed her entire back catalogue from the firm's service just days before releasing her album 1989.

The move was taken to help drive sales rather than allowing people to listen to it for free - she claimed albums should be listened to and consumed in full as a piece of 'art'.

It triggered an extremely public spat between the company and Swift, with Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek hitting back to claim his organisation had paid $2billion (£1.2billion) in artist royalties since the company's inception.

Furthermore, he argued the service should be compared to free radio broadcasting, rather than traditional album sales.

He said: 'You can't look at Spotify in isolation – even though Taylor can pull her music off Spotify (where we license and pay for every song we've ever played), her songs are all over services and sites like YouTube and Soundcloud, where people can listen all they want for free.'

But criticism of Spotify hasn't just been limited to Swift, with ACDC and Radiohead both previously expressing frustration at its royalties scheme.

Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke withdrew his project Atoms for Peace from Spotify in 2013 and launched an angry Twitter tirade over its royalty rates.

'Make no mistake new artists you discover on #Spotify will no get paid,' he posted. 'Meanwhile shareholders will shortly being rolling in it. Simples.'

Take That  - who lost long-time member Jason Orange this year - will also play an album launch party for a handful of fans which is being hosted by internet giant Google in central London.

Their other albums continue to be available to fans, despite the announcement tonight that their label Polydor has struck a deal with Google.

It is said to be 'the first time they have partnered so extensively with a digital platform'.

A statement from the group said: 'We would like to thank Google Play for coming up with such a great, creative campaign around the release of an album we're extremely proud of.

'We also wanted to do something different for this release and are looking forward to seeing it come to life, kicking off with a very special album launch party on Monday for a small number of some of our biggest supporters.'

The group - Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen - are also jostling to be number one in the UK singles chart this week, just a few sales behind the current chart-topper Band Aid 30's new version of Do They Know It's Christmas?. The track, called These Days, is just 1,500 copies behind the charity single according to midweek data released by the Official Chart Company.

Zahavah Levine, the vice president of Google Play Music, said of the deal: 'We're thrilled to partner with Take That, and to offer Google Play Music fans an exclusive opportunity to stream this incredible album.

'Both download sales and streaming are growing on our service, so we're delighted to see Gary, Mark and Howard embracing Play Music to bring their fans a unique experience.'

Announcing the deal, Take That said the exclusive streaming on Google would be a deluxe version of the album and would include 'three bonus tracks that will not be available on any other streaming or download service'.

Spotify declined to comment on the band's decision to work exclusively with Google.
