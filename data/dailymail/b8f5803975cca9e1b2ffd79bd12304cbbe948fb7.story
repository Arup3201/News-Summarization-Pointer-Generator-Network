A raft of high-street promotions in the run-up to Christmas triggered the largest drop in inflation in nearly three years.

Consumer prices index inflation dropped to 4.2 per cent in December from 4.8 per cent in November, according to the Office for National Statistics.

This was equal to the decline between March and April 2009.

The drop was driven by a 2.8 per cent fall in the price of clothing and footwear as retailers slashed prices in the run-up to Christmas.

But there was less evidence than expected of the impact of the supermarket price war which started in early October, as food prices rose by 1.4 per cent month on month.

The UK rate of inflation has begun to fall off in recent months after rising more than 2 per cent in less than two years

The drop in the rate of inflation in December shows the pressure on households is easing after a sustained period of high prices and slow wage growth.

The ONS said downward pressure also came from
fuel prices, which dropped 0.6 per cent, and alcoholic drinks, which fell 1.5 per cent 
between November and December.

The rate is still more than double the 2
per cent target set for the Bank of England by the Government, but the 
Bank has insisted inflation would drop steadily from its peak of 5.2 per
cent in September.

The Bank of England, in its last inflation report in November, said that it expected the rate of inflation to fall back gradually through 2012 before possibly undershooting the Government's 2 per cent target next year.

The increase in the cost of living is 
expected to slow further as the economy grinds to a halt and 
unemployment soars towards the three million mark.

Aggressive High Street cost-cutting in the run up to Christmas has helped force down inflation

December's figures and any further slowdown in inflation will support the argument in favour of holding interest rates at record lows of 0.5 per cent and injecting billions of pounds into the Bank's quantitative easing programme.

Looking ahead, Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial information services company Markit, said: 'Further falls are likely in coming months, reducing the squeeze on incomes seen last year and therefore providing a much needed boost to economic growth in 2012.'

The fall in clothing prices was driven by a wide range of garments, with a particularly large drop in women's outerwear, the ONS said.

The retail sector has been one of the
most visible victims of last year's consumer spending squeeze as a 
string of businesses closed stores or fell into administration.

High Street sales of clothing and footwear were a key contributor to the change in CPI

Moderating prices on the High 
Street and at the supermarket has helped forced down inflation

There was some upward pressure last month with the largest price increases coming from mobile phone charges, rising 1.3 per cent.

Elsewhere,
alternative measures of inflation also fell, with the retail prices 
index (RPI) dropping from 5.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent.

Vicky Redwood, economist at Capital Economics, said today's figures paved the way for a further increase in QE next month.

She
said: 'Obviously these falls in inflation will help to alleviate the 
squeeze on households' real pay - but the deteriorating labour market 
and tightening credit conditions will maintain the downward pressure on 
consumer spending this year.'

Victoria Cadman at Investec said: 'Evidence for December to date suggests that it has been another month of heavy discounting on the high street, helping to keep a hold on clothing and other goods price inflation.'

Earlier this month, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said shop price inflation fell to 1.7 per cent in December down from 2 per cent in November - its lowest level for 16 months.

The rate of inflation for non-food items was at a two-year low of 0.3 per cent, and significantly down on 0.8 per cent in the previous month. This was driven by price cuts on electrical items, clothes and footwear, with many items cheaper than they were a year ago.

However, the BRC said food prices rose 4.2 per cent, which was slightly higher than November's 4 per cent increase, despite the high level of supermarket discounts.

The finding was a surprise as the big players had been embroiled in a price war after Tesco announced a Â£500 million price-cutting campaign. Asda guaranteed to be 10 per cent cheaper than its rivals and Sainsbury's launched its own brand price-matching scheme.

The downward trend for headline inflation is set to continue in January, which will be the first month that the figures will not be pushed up by last year's hike in VAT to 20 per cent.

Utility tariff cuts announced this week will also help bring inflation down in coming months.
