An orbiting factory that will build super-sized structures in space is being funded by Nasa. 

The multi-armed factory will use 3D printing and robotics to create giant space structures, such as antennas and solar arrays, that would otherwise have been impossible to launch from Earth. 

A demonstration of the factory, dubbed SpiderFab, could be ready by 2020, after Washington-based technology firm Tethers Unlimited (TUI) was awarded a $500,000 contract to develop the factory.

antennas, solar arrays, and telescopes in space

SpiderFab uses 3D printing and robotics to enable space systems to build and put together large components such as antennas, solar arrays, sensor masts, and shrouds on orbit. 

Currently, large spacecraft components are built on the ground, and are designed to fold up to fit within a rocket shroud and then deploy on orbit.

But this approach is hugely expensive, and the size of these components is limited by the volume of available shrouds.

‘On orbit fabrication allows the material for these critical components to be launched in a very compact and durable form, such as spools of fibre or blocks of polymer, so they can fit into a smaller, less expensive launch vehicle,’ said Dr Rob Hoyt, TUI’s chief scientist.

Spiderfab will enable space systems to be launched in a compact and durable 'embryonic' state. Once in orbit, these systems will use techniques evolved from emerging additive manufacturing and automated assembly technologies to create huge space structures

‘Once on orbit, the SpiderFab robotic fabrication systems will process the material to create extremely large structures that are optimised for the space environment. 

‘This radically different approach to building space systems will enable us to create antennas and arrays that are tens to hundreds of times larger than are possible now, providing higher power, higher bandwidth, higher resolution, and higher sensitivity for a wide range of space missions.’

Space factories would also significantly reduce the risk of launching delicate equipment on rockets, where the chance of failure is high.

The funding follows an initial contract that was given earlier this year to test the viability of the technology. 

In the Phase II effort, TUI will develop and demonstrate methods to enable additive manufacturing of high performance support structures such as reflectors and antennas.

Alongside this, TUI is working under a Nasa Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract to develop a ‘Trusselator’ device that will fabricate truss structures to enable in space construction of large solar arrays.

‘The Trusselator is the key first step in implementing the SpiderFab architecture,’ said Dr Hoyt.

‘Once we’ve demonstrated that it works, we will be well on our way towards creating football field sized antennas and telescopes to help search for Earth like exoplanets and evidence of extraterrestrial life.’

The funding follows a string of projects by Nasa to develop 3D printing in space.

Last month, the largest 3D printed 
rocket engine component Nasa ever has tested blazed to life during an 
engine firing that generated a record 20,000 pounds of thrust.

The component was manufactured using selective laser melting. This method built up layers of nickel-chromium alloy powder to make the complex, subscale injector with its 28 elements for channeling and mixing propellants.

The part was similar in size to injectors that power small rocket engines. It was similar in design to injectors for large engines, such as the RS-25 engine that will power NASA's Space Launch System  rocket for deep space human missions to an asteroid and Mars.

This test was a milestone for one of many important advances the agency is making to reduce the cost of space hardware.
