From Kalashnikovs and AK47s, to dynamite and tear gas, this shocking image reveals the staggering arsenal accumulated by kosher deli killer Amedy Coulibaly before his deadly attack in Paris last week.

The hostage-taker, who gunned down a police officer before shooting dead four people in a Paris supermarket last week, assembled his cache of deadly weapons at a hideout in the Parisian suburb of Gentilly, along with the black flags of ISIS, ammunition, and several IDs.

The militant Islamist's final hide-out was raised by police last Saturday and investigators are now hunting a fourth 'accomplice' whose traces were found at the second floor apartment.

Kalashnikovs, Ak47s, dynamite and tear gas, among the cache of weapons found at the home of deli killer Amedy Coulibaly

Coulibaly was married to Hayat Boumeddiene, another 26-year-old Islamic fanatic, who is thought to have helped mastermind the bloody slaughter which left 20 dead, including the three terrorists, around Paris last week. She then fled to Syria

The Islamic fundamentalist disowned his own parents as far back as 2010 as he begun a spiralling descent into radical Islam, police wiretaps reveal.

The French Muslim was arrested in May of that year for his part in a plot to free a convicted terrorist from prison.

Prosecution documents obtained by MailOnline, show that even then Coulibaly had turned his back on his family because of ‘their kaffir ways’.

'Kaffirs' are Muslims who are regarded as having rejected the Qaran.

The documents also suggest that the Muslim of Malian origin may have already been flirting with the idea of martyrdom, as he was recordeded asking what would happen to his debts when he died.

And a psychiatric evaluation at the time revealed that the future killer even then had ‘psychopathic tendencies.’

Interviews with his terror-fixer wife Hayat Boumedienne, published earlier this week, revealed that Coulibaly was already making frequent visits to a suspected terror training camp in France.

The alleged camp, where Boumedienne was photographed firing a crossbow in full burkha, was run by Djamel Beghal alias Abou Hamza, himself a disciple of reviled London hate preacher Abu Hamza.

The cache of new documents record how Coulibaly boasted to his mentor that he had fully rejected his family in favour of a complete devotion to militant Islam.

In police wire taps, the French Muslim, a trained electronic audio visual installer, related how he had ‘disowned his parents’ whom he was disgusted with because of their more relaxed interpretation of their faith.

In the interceptions Coulibaly relayed to Hamza how he flew into a furious rage with his sisters when they asked him for help with their children because he did not believe that they were being raised as proper Muslims.

He refused to help and said: ‘I banged my fist on the table and said “Listen to me all of you who are here, who don’t teach their child to pray and stuff like that, there’s no point calling me, I won’t give a Euro for the child, I will do nothing at all for it’

He added: ‘I said for me that’s how things are. For me, religion comes first, I don’t give a sh*t about the family.’

Coulibaly and Abou Hamza were recorded talking with Smaïn Ait Ali Belkahem, who was convicted of involvement in the 1995 Paris subway attacks, according to the prosecution documents.

They discussed a project that would take time because it would be ‘on a grand scale’.

The documents emerged as two more youths from the same Paris suburb as terrorist Amedy Coulibaly were arrested after a policewoman guarding the Elysee Palace was ‘deliberately run over’.

The officer, who is in hospital, said the 19-year-old driver looked into her eyes as he drove into her, flinging her across the bonnet. She suffered injuries to the wrists, arms and back.

There were a series of similar attacks across France before Christmas, with drivers said to be shouting Islamic slogans as they drove into crowds, and tried to ram down police.

It came as French Interior Minister Manuel Valls placed an extra 10,000 troops on the streets of France and warned: ‘We are at war’.

He also confirmed that there were ‘without doubt’ accomplices to the Paris attack, saying ‘the hunt will go on to find them’.

Hundreds of thousands of the controversial copies of the ‘survival edition’ of Charlie Hebdo appeared in kiosks and newsagents across France again today, but most were sold out by 7am.
