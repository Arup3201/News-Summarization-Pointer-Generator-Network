Mark Semmens allegedly hit a man twice in the head during an argument over a hat

A man has faced court on serious assault charges after fracturing a man’s skull in a dispute over a cap during a night out.

Mark Semmens, 35, from Bondi in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, faced Downing Centre Local Court today accused of punching a 25-year-old man in the face and leaving him with a fractured skull.

Police will allege the attack happened after an argument broke out at an inner Sydney pub when the 25-year-old seized Mr Semmens' cap and put it on his head at 7.30pm on July 19.

Mr Semmens allegedly retaliated by punching the man twice in the face, which caused him to fall and strike the back of his head against the ground.

He was taken to St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney where he was treated for a split lip and a possible fractured skull.

Mr Semmens was charged with one count of causing grievous bodily harm and assault.

The 35-year-old will reappear in the Downing Centre Local Court on August 26

Kings Cross Inspector Pat Gooley told Daily Mail Australia the injuries to the 25-year-old were 'very serious.'

'It does appear the pair did have a verbal argument and words were exchanged,' he said.

'Police are alleging that the accused person punched his victim twice, before striking his head on the ground.'

Mr Semmens did not enter pleas to the charges when he appeared briefly in the Downing Centre Local Court on Tuesday.

He has been granted conditional bail and will reappear on August 26.
