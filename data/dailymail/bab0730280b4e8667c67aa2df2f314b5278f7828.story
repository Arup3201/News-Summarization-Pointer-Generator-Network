The Shard has been named the best skyscraper in the world after claiming first place in an international competition.

The 306-metre tall building - the tallest in Europe - was praised by judges for its glass fragment-shape and sophisticated architecture.

The buidling, which has become a significant part of the London skyline, won the Emporis Skyscraper Award after being chosen by an international panel of experts from more than 300 skyscrapers 100 metres or higher completed in the previous calendar year.

The 306-metre tall building - the tallest in Europe - was praised by judges for its glass fragment-shaped form and sophisticated architecture

The Shard was chosen by an international panel of experts from more than 300 skyscrapers of at least 100 metres' height completed in the previous calendar year

The jury said: 'Construction of The Shard was complicated by the particularly tight site and therefore needed innovative planning.

'This makes the result all the more impressive: a skyscraper that is recognized immediately and which is already considered London's new emblem.'

The building was designed by Renzo Piano, and officially opened in July 2012. The highest accessible part of it is the observation deck on the 72nd floor.

Parts of it remain empty, with the latest part of it to be finished a branch of Shangri-La hotels which occupies from the 34th floor to the 52nd.

The Emporis Skyscraper Award is one of the world's most renowned prizes for high-rise architecture and has been awarded annually since 2000.

Each year a jury of experts from across the globe select a winner based primarily on aesthetics and functional design.

The 250-metre tall Viennese DC Tower 1, by Dominique Perrault Architecture, won second place in the awards

Second place this year went to the 250-metre tall DC Tower 1, in Vienna, which was designed by Dominique Perrault Architecture.

The building features three mirror-smooth sides broken by a jagged fourth.

The skyscraper's comprehensive sustainability concept also impressed judges. The site features photovoltaics to 
generate energy, local plants with low water requirements in the green 
areas of the building, and electric car chargers to save on carbon 
dioxide emissions.

The Sheraton Huzhou Hot Spring Resort, on Lake Tai, near Shanghai in China, took third place.

The 102-metre tall hotel, whose shape evokes a gigantic ring, was conceived by architects MAD, who also came up with last year's winner The Absolute World Towers, two blocks of high rise apartments dubbed the 'Marilyn Monroe of the architectural world'.

The flats earned the name because their hourglass figure is said to bear a similar shape to that of the Hollywood film star.

Designed by MAD and Burka Architects they twist 209 degrees from their base to the top floor, 56 storeys up.

This year's winners' list contained a total of five European projects - the last time so many were represented was six years ago.

The Shard's victory is the fifth time the architecture prize has gone to Europe.

However, after the award had gone in the last two years to Absolute World Towers in Canada and New York by Gehry at Eight Spruce Street in the U.S., no North American skyscraper features in the top ten this year.
