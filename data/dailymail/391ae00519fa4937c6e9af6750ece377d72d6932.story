A homeless man  who returned a diamond engagement ring to its owner has seen his family for the first time in 16 years after his kind gesture made headlines around the world.

Billy Ray Harris was being interviewed about  how he returned the ring to Sarah Darling after she accidentally dropped it into his collection cup in Kansas City, Missouri.

But he was left virtually speechless when his long-lost siblings who live 640 miles away in Texas entered the set during the middle of the TV interview.

In an emotional reunion, Mr Harris hugged his three sisters and his brother who had travelled from their home in Texas to surprise their brother on the TODAY.com show.

He said: 'This is a really big surprise. I'm shocked. I never would have thought this - it's a total shock.

The website has so far more than $180,000 for the homeless man who has now been able to buy a house and get a part-time job.

But even more importantly, be able to reconnect with his family who believed he was dead.

Speaking on the TODAY.com show, his sister Nellie E. Vaughn said: 'For years we were wondering if he was still alive. It's good news.'

The brother and sister then reconnected during a series of long and emotional telephone conversations during which they caught up on the past decade and a half.

‘It was nice. I was crying,’ she told TODAY.com.
‘I was happy to hear from my brother. I told him I just couldn't 
believe he stayed homeless for so long when he knew he could come back. I
would always give my brother a place to stay.’

But the meeting on the TV programme on Sunday was the first time they had seen each other in person.

His brother Edwin Harris and sister Elsie 'EJ' Johnson also turned up at the show.

Darling had put her engagement ring in her purse for safekeeping, but then emptied the contents into Harris' collection cup  by mistake

Billy Ray says he is overjoyed to be back in touch with his siblings. ‘I
hadn't talked to her in so many years. I was totally excited and 
surprised'.

When Sarah
Darling accidentally dropped her engagement ring into Billy Ray's 
donation cup she set off a chain of events which have changed his life 
forever.

Darling's husband Bill Krejci, who set-up the donations page, helped Harris 
to get his identification documents straightened out so he could open
a bank account to access the donations raised for him.

The couple and Mr Harris have become close friends and have gone to watch hockey games and films together.

He said: 'It's amazing. I appreciate it and want to thank all the people who helped me.

Harris
says he’s excited about what the future holds, and is most thankful 
that the amazing experience has helped him to get back in touch with his
siblings.

‘That's the main thing,’ he said. ‘To me, that's the best thing to come out of this whole deal.’
