The traditional locket has undergone a modern twist by connecting to social networks to give you an up-to-the-minute reminder of loved ones.

Artefact, based in Seattle, has created 'Purple' - a necklace which connects to pre-selected friends and family on Facebook and Instagram.

Using the companion app, wearers can select people and moments important to them, which are then displayed on the locket's screen.

They can also animate and edit photos, applying filters and effects.

With various photos stored on the gadget, the screen works like that of a touchscreen smartphone, allowing the wearer to swipe through each image.

The wearer can also stay connected with friends and family - both sending and receiving images. 

The locket is designed as a simple circle with a curved lid which reveals a subtle light for each new notification - the latest photo from the wearer's nearest and dearest.

The £90 ($145) ringly

At first glance, it looks like any other large piece of jewellery. However, the gemstone in the £90 ($145) Ringly had a hidden feature - it can tell you when someone is calling.

The ring vibrates and light up when you receive a call or message, or even an alert from social media. You can give friends their own colour so you know who is calling without having to take your phone out of your pocket.

A special app allows users to customise their ring, changing everything from the number of vibrations to the colour for each caller. 

It is still a proof-of-concept gadget and a release date has yet to be set. However, it is expected comes in a variety of styles, from platinum, silver, gold and brushed glass.

The necklace doesn't require a USB port, charging instead through a ceramic charging bowl in which the locket can be placed.

‘Adults who use Facebook have on average more than 300 friends. The average office worker receives more than 100 emails every day,’ said Artefact.

‘Yet often, we are far away from the people we truly care about.

‘The firehose of information, alerts and notifications makes us anxious and distracted, taking us away from the people and moments we cherish.

‘Purple is designed to help us remember the important things in our lives.’
