Pupils in Scotland could be swapping the real football pitch for a virtual one during PE classes, under proposals put forward at an education conference.

Plans to introduce popular sport-related video games, such as Football Manager and Just Dance as part of PE lessons, were discussed during a meeting of the Scottish Association of Teachers of Physical Education.

Key speaker at the meeting Len Almond, former foundation director of the British Heart Foundation National Centre, suggested the games could be used to encourage more youngsters into sport.

'When you look at video gaming, the theory behind them has a lot to offer teachers in schools,' he told MailOnline.

'I'm not suggesting (pupils) just sit watch more video games. But we can learn an awful lot in how we attract young people to learning and we motivate them in that. 

 'If a teacher felt it was appropriate to use video games for children's work- maybe part of examination subject- I'd have no problem with that. It's the learning potential that is the important criteria.

'In effect, what we are saying is, they have found a way of exciting young children, they have found a way of self-corrected learning, internal motivation, and ensured they become part of the story.'

Mr Almond said video games could never fully replace traditional physical education, but suggested games such as Football Manager could be a useful tool in encouraging more children into football. 

'There is one way of using video gaming, where you're managing football teams which is an interesting thing you could do with young people,' he added.

The plans aim at to boost the popularity of sport and PE classes- and already seems to be going down well judging from a tweet by the company behind the game

'You're planning, directing and making decisions and if that helps a young person understand the game, that is very good.

'It shouldn't replace getting out into the countryside and participating in much more physical activities.

'But video games might have a role for some children.

'The important thing is, we have got to attract young people to sport and physical education.' 

Aberdeen Grammar School, where PE Iain Stanger has computer game have the potential to enhance learning

Association president and PE teacher at Aberdeen Grammar School, Iain Stanger, agreed and said other games, such as Wii Fit and Minecraft, could also have the potential to enhance learning for pupils in the city.

Mr Stanger told the Evening Express: 'I know some schools using fantasy role games and others such as Minecraft which have the potential to enhance people's learning. Games such as Just Dance and Wii Fit also have the potential to do this.'

Mr Almond said: 'Games such as Football Manager are a very good way to get people to understand football and the role it has in our society.'

The Scottish Association of Teachers of Physical Education, which has more than 300 members, aims to come up with ways of producing 'high quality, structured and progressive physical education'.
