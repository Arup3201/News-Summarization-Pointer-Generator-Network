Christopher Parry, 49, is accused of loading a shotgun and waiting for bank worker Caroline (pictured) to leave her new lover's home for work at 8.30am, and waving for her to pull over in her car

A jealous husband shot his wife dead after laying wait for her in the street outside her new lover's hom, a court heard.

Christopher Parry, 49, is accused of loading a shotgun and waiting for bank worker Caroline to leave her new lover’s home in Newport, Wales, and waving for her to pull over in her car.

Prosecutor Michael Mather-Lees said: 'When she stopped to speak to her husband he went to the boot of his car for the shotgun.

'He shot her twice in the back - it was carefully planned by a man who was in full control of himself when he murdered his wife.'

Parry then turned the gun on himself.

But Newport Crown Court heard he survived 'substantial head injuries' despite shooting himself at point-blank range with the semi-automatic shotgun.

The jury was told that Parry had been a 'controlling and dominant individual' during his 27 year marriage to  Mrs Parry

Mr Mather-Lees said: 'Such was the state of the marriage she left and went to live with her mother, telling her husband she would never go back to him.

'But he could not accept the fact that his wife had left him after years of unhappiness.

'She later went to live with a man called Gary Bidmead who she had met before she left the marital home.

'In the months before the murder he watched her, followed her, phoned her and texted her persistently.

'Her husband kept her under surveillance - this was a man not prepared to let go.

'He told a friend of his wife’s that he had hired a private detective to follow her.'

The court heard Parry had a shotgun licence and kept three firearms at his home in Cwmbran, South Wales.

Mr Mather-Lees said Parry had selected the semi-automatic Remington to be used in the killing along with 'Triple A' heavy gauge metal pellets in August last year.

Parry then turned the gun on himself. But Newport Crown Court heard he survived 'substantial head injuries' despite shooting himself at point-blank range with the semi-automatic shotgun

Mr Mather-Lees said: 'On the morning in question the defendent loaded the semi automatic and put a bandelier of 14 other cartridges in his black Ford Focus, along with his shotgun certificate.

'He drove to Newport and pulled his wife over.

'For some reason Mrs Parry opened the boot of her car and that’s when her husband shot her.

'Parry later claimed it was his intention to kill himself infront of his wife - not shoot her.

'If that was the case why did he have a semi-automatic with three cartridges?

'The answer is he was planning to kill her and kill her he did.'

The court heard CCTV film of the street surrounding the alleged murder showed that Parry had been there two days earlier.

Mr Mather-Lees said: 'If you add all the activities together, he was a man who was not prepared to let go, someone who kept his wife under surveillance and found out where she was living and armed himself for the task he was about to carry out.

'It was a carefully planned scheme.'

Parry has admitted manslaughter but denies murder.

The trial continues.
