Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston will be now suspended for the whole of Saturday's game against Clemson after yelling obscenities about the female anatomy in the center of campus.

The 20-year-old, Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback shouted 'f*** her right in the p****' in the middle of the Tallahassee campus on Tueday.  

Interim President Garnett S. Stokes and athletic director Stan Wilcox announced the decision late Friday night. 

There had been criticism that the original punishment of half a game for Winston's latest embarrassing off-field incident was too light.

Suspended: Heisman Trophy-winner Jameis Winston was suspended for half a game for shouting obscenities in the center of FSU campus Tuesday

The statement released by the university Friday read, 'Based upon the results of our continuing investigation of Tuesday's incident involving Jameis Winston, we have decided to not play him for the entire game against Clemson on Saturday night.'

The university also had initially announced that Winston would face internal discipline. Officials did not say why Winston was only benched for just a half and they did not provide details of the internal punishment. 

Winston's alleged crimes run from the absurd, such as shoplifting crab and stealing soda in ketchup cups, to the horrific, as Winston was accused of raping a student in 2012.  

The phrase he shouted comes from a series of videos staged to look newscasts that went viral earlier in the year.

On Wednesday FSU's athletic director Stan Wilcox and interim president Garrett Stokes issued a statement saying Winston 'will be withheld from competition for the first half of the Clemson game.'

Winston called his outburst a 'selfish act' in his regularly scheduled press conference after news of the suspension broke.

 Winston was the target of a rape investigation after a fellow student said he sexually assaulted her while she was intoxicated back in December 2012 as a teammate filmed the act.

The New York Times reported in the wake of the alleged sexual assault at Florida State that there was 'virtually no investigation at all.'

Police waited almost a year to interview a witness and gather DNA evidence from the accused, finally declining to prosecute Winston. A Title IX investigation was later launched against FSU.

In 2013, cops were called to a Tallahassee Burger King after an assistant manager says she saw Winston stealing soda in ketchup cups. No charges were pressed at the time.

The next year, Winston was caught on camera walking out of a Publix supermarket with $32.72 worth of crab legs and crawfish without paying. 

According to Tomahawk Nation Winston received a citation and his punishment was community service and a temporary suspension from the baseball team, where he plays outfield.
