Maybe it is the location, something in the air. Joga bonito, and all that. Play beautifully. No country wants to come to a World Cup in Brazil, the spiritual home of football at its most compelling, and stink the place out. Again.

That applies to England more than most. After a dismal experience in South Africa in 2010 and a week of predictions based around a dour, goalless draw, played at an Amazonian snail’s pace in the tropical heat, England came out of the blocks in Manaus as if set down at Anfield on a perfect autumn afternoon.

Lost, obviously, but that happens in football. Sometimes you don’t get what you deserve. A fair few in the squad know all about that this season.

Forward thinking: Daniel Sturridge and England must carry on attacking if they are to get out of the group

More of this, please: Sturridge's goal came after a flowing, pacy counter-attack by England

Anyway, it is too late to change now. Roy Hodgson has arrived at this tournament with a battle-plan based around a sprightly, youthful, forward line, and must stick to it in Sao Paulo on Thursday. Defeat and England will be as good as out, but Hodgson cannot afford to think like that.

To play Uruguay and Luis Suarez minus an element of risk would invite disaster; a draw that would put incredible pressure on a final win over Costa Rica or the breakaway goal that might seal England’s fate in the shortest time possible.

For Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez to play Suarez may be a gamble after rushing his return from injury, but have no doubt that he can score.

He is a streetfighter and a street footballer with a desire that borders on insanity. The best way to put him, and Uruguay, out of business is to focus on a creaking, vulnerable defence that leaked three to Costa Rica.

Late run: Raheem Sterling has come from virtually nowhere to be a major threat for England

Hodgson’s strategy out here as good as decides itself — embrace the spirit of Brazil, or bust. There is no alternative.

Could we see more of him? Ross Barkley could be an alternative should England want to attack

England’s back line, sadly, is not set up to hold a lead. Had it been Daniel Sturridge, not Mario Balotelli, that had scored with a far post header in the 50th minute on Saturday, England would not have been able to see the game out with the certainty that Italy did.

Cesare Prandelli’s players reverted to type once that goal went in, a bank of five in front of a fortress of four, as thick as tar through the middle, and England could find no way through.

Wayne Rooney missed a good chance in the second half and Leighton Baines had a free-kick saved but as the game wore on genuine threats to goal grew fewer, as Italy’s vice grip got tighter and, if anything, they looked likelier to snatch a third on the break.

Trading blows in front of goal the teams were evenly matched. What was clear, however, is that a plan of containment that was so effective in Ukraine for Hodgson will not fly for long out here. England must play to their strengths and if this makes contests more open than is traditionally considered healthy, so be it.

Despite his protestations to the contrary, Hodgson is not a natural cavalier. Andros Townsend supplemented James Milner in the qualifying matches only when backs were to the wall and Raheem Sterling’s run into the first-team could not have been timed any later.

Yet, like most coaches of experience, he is a pragmatist — and sometimes the most pragmatic means of defence is attack.

Wide of the mark: Wayne Rooney missed a golden chance and did not look comfortable on the wing

Why do Liverpool play as they do, and Arsenal? It is simple. What other option do they have? Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says he would never send a team out to suck the life from the game as Chelsea did at Anfield last season but the fact is, he couldn’t if he wished to. Not with Liverpool’s defence. If he ever gets a rearguard as reliable as his forwards — or as rugged as Chelsea’s — we shall see how loyal he is to those principles.

For all the talk of a Liverpool way, their greatest teams under Bob Paisley, for instance, were not known for flying into away fixtures gung-ho. They could hold a lead as well as any collection of Italians, because they possessed some of Europe’s greatest defenders — Alan Hansen, Mark Lawrenson, Phil Neal, Steve Nicol, and plenty more.

Ahead of them Graeme Souness protected the yard as fiercely as any Doberman on a chain. Arsenal under George Graham were the same.

Arsene Wenger values winning beautifully and so there has been disproportionate focus on the front of the team in his tenure. The last time Arsenal defended for their lives was on the way to the Champions League final in 2006. Since then they have been gorgeously one-dimensional; but, then, they have to be.

Picking up the pace: Danny Welbeck was part of England's front four against Italy

This is true of England, too. Hodgson picks the best back four available — notwithstanding the moot debate over Ashley Cole and Baines, and the closed door that is John Terry — but he will know deep down that it does not pass muster against the best attacking units here. It would be very dangerous indeed to imagine England could play a cautious game against Uruguay, nick a goal and sit on that lead.

No time to change it: Hodgson must stick with the bold, attacking approach

The onslaught that started the match with Italy is undoubtedly the way to go once more. England must continue to make a virtue of the confidence of youth, the pace and technical ambition that came so close to establishing a significant lead in Manaus.

Going into Sunday’s games, England topped the 14-team table for shots at goal. Greater accuracy is the key. If that is achieved, Uruguay will not withstand. If anything, they are considerably more vulnerable at the back than England.

There is another reason to get on the front foot. At the last World Cup, of the 16 teams eliminated at the group stage, 14 failed to win their first game. Nine of those lost and five drew. Only Switzerland and Slovenia won and went out. The numbers after game two are even more worrying.

Only three teams made it to round two without recording a victory in the opening two matches: England (two draws), United States (two draws) and Slovakia (draw, defeat). Hodgson cannot rely on his players getting so lucky again.

‘We are not the type of team to sit back and, unfortunately, that left one or two opportunities for Italy to get the ball in,’ said Hodgson.

That will be true against Uruguay, too. It is scarcely believable that Suarez will not fashion at least one opportunity in front of goal, even half fit.

England’s mission is to render this moment an irrelevance. There is only one way to achieve that. More of the same and let the best team win.
