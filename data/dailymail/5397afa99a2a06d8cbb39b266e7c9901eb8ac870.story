She's the self-proclaimed selfie queen and recently announced  she is  releasing a book filled with hundreds of pictures of her own face.

Now, in a new video for T-Mobile, Kim has dispensed some advice on how to take the perfect selfie. 

And it looks like you're going to need to put some time aside as the reality TV star's advice includes taking a whopping 300 photos. 

She loves a selfie: T-Mobile shared a selection of Kim's personal selfies on their Twitter today 

Kim tries out a series of poses, such as putting her arms up, but she always like to keep her signature pout

When taking selfies Kim likes to hold her phone high above her head and tilt her chin down

In the clip Kim begins by saying: 'Hi I'm Kim Kardashian-West and I'm going to give you a little tutorial on how to take the perfect selfie.'

She goes on to explain: 'If you don't have a mirror in front of you to figure out your pose and your angle make sure that the lighting is amazing because you want to blow out everything that you don't want to see and highlight all the good things that you do. 

'For me I know my perfect angle it's my chin down and I just pose away and take about 300 photos until I get the perfect selfie.' 

Of course there is no one more passionate about the art of selfie taking than Kim.

After all she is the woman who once describing taking photos of herself as, 'the purpose of life.'  

In the clip Kim talks about how important it is to find your perfect angle

It's also previously been reported that Kim has her very own selfie assistant whose sole job it is to help the star edit and upload her snaps to social media. 

And with 25.5million Instagram followers and a further 28.4million on Twitter it's little wonder that she wants to keep them impressed. 

Kim's selfie advice comes after her hilarious Super Bowl advert for the mobile company in which she mocks herself for her love of taking selfies.

In what sounds like a spoof charity advert Kim says in a deadpan voice: 'Hi. I'm Kim. Each month millions of gigs of unused data are taken back by wireless companies. Tragic.

'Data you paid for that could be used to see my makeup, my backhand, my outfits, my vacation and my outfits.'  

However, whilst some people praised Kim for being able to take the mick out of herself, others criticised the ad. 

One twitter user said: 'I feel like T-Mobile doesn't have $4million to waste like that,' whilst another said, '#stopkim I just lost seconds from my life from that ad.'  

Earlier today the mobile company also released a series of Kim's personal selfies on Twitter under the hashtag #KimsDataStash. 

Pouting and posing in a variety of locations the mother-of-one truly proved her selfie taking prowess.
