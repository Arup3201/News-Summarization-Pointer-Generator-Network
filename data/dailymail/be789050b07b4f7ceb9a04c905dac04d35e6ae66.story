Scientists are worried about the world's declining honey bee population, which could devastate the  crops and lead to food shortages across the globe.

Now, in a bid to stop the rapid decline, experts have fitted ‘backpack’ sensors to 5,000 bees in Australia to unravel why colonies there do not seem to be affected by  the ‘colony collapse disorder’ that is decimating bee populations in other countries.

The research aims to improve honey bee pollination and productivity on farms as well.

Scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) have fitted 5,000 tiny sensors, measuring just 2.5mm squared to the backs of  honey bees in Hobart, Tasmania, before releasing them into the wild

To attach the ‘backpack’ sensors, the bees were refrigerated for a short period, which put them into a rest state.

Researchers quickly glued the tiny RFID sensors to their backs while they were sleepy.

After a few minutes, the honeybees woke up and were ready to return to their hive and start gathering valuable information.

Dr
 de Souza said: ‘This is a non-destructive process and the sensors 
appear to have no impact on the bee's ability to fly and carry out its 
normal duties.’

Scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) have fitted 5,000 tiny sensors, measuring just 2.5mm squared to the backs of  honey bees in Hobart, Tasmania, before releasing them into the wild.

It is the first time such large numbers of insects have been used for environmental monitoring.

‘Honey bees play a vital role in the landscape through a free pollination service for agriculture, which various crops rely on to increase yields’ said CSIRO science leader Dr Paulo de Souza, who is heading up the swarm sensing project.

‘A recent CSIRO study showed bee pollination in Faba beans can lead to a productivity increase of 17 per cent.

‘Around one third of the food we eat relies on pollination, but honey bee populations around the world are crashing because of the dreaded Varroa mite and Colony Collapse Disorder.

‘Thankfully, Australia is currently free from both of those threats,’ he added.

The bees' high-tech backpacks (pictured) are tiny Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensors that record when an insect passes a particular check point. The information is then sent to a central location where researchers can build a three dimensional model and discover how the insects move through the landscape

The research will also look at the impacts of agricultural pesticides on honey bees by monitoring insects that feed at sites with trace amounts of commonly used chemicals.

‘Using this technology, we aim to understand the bee's relationship with its environment,’ said Dr de Souza.

‘This should help us understand optimal productivity conditions as well as further our knowledge of the cause of colony collapse disorder,’ in which worker bees from a beehive or European honey bee colony abruptly disappear.

The bees’ high-tech backpacks are tiny Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensors that record when an insect passes a particular check point.

The information is then sent remotely to a central location where researchers can use the signals from the 5,000 sensors to build a comprehensive three dimensional model and discover how the insects move through the landscape.

Dr de Souza said: ‘Bees are social insects that return to the same point and operate on a very predictable schedule.

There are only enough honeybees in Britain to properly pollinate a quarter of the country’s crops, scientists claim.

Destruction
 of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have
 caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees, which are 
vital for food production.

Professor
 Simon Potts of the University of Reading, who led the research project,
 said: ‘We face a catastrophe in future years unless we act now.’

The
 research, published in the journal PLOS One, found that Europe has 
13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its 
crops.

Bee populations 
have plummeted as their meadowland habitats were concreted over and 
their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides.

Previous studies have estimated that the number of British honeybees have halved over the last 25 years.

Scientists
 think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn
 that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand 
pollination.

The new pesticide, Hv1a/GNA, has no effect on bees' learning, which is key to their foraging for food. Researchers said that the chemical cocktail has potential as an environmentally friendly 'bee safe' pesticide and an alternative to those suspected of decimating colonies.

'Any change in their behaviour indicates a change in their environment. If we can model their movements, we'll be able to recognise very quickly when their activity shows variation and identify the cause.

'This will help us understand how to maximise their productivity as well as monitor for any biosecurity risks.'

The scientists involved in the project believe that understanding bee behaviour will give farmers and fruit growers improved management knowledge, which will help them increase the benefit received from nature’s free pollination service.

The researchers are working with the University of Tasmania, the Tasmanian Beekeepers Association, local beekeepers in Hobart and fruit growers around the state to trial the technology.

The next stage of the project is to reduce the size of the sensors to only 1mm so they can be attached to smaller insects such as mosquitoes and fruit flies.
