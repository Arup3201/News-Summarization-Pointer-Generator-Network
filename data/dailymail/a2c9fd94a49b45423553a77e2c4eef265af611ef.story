A fugitive killer who fled Britain was brought to justice after he was accidentally hit by a passenger train whilst on the run in Holland.

Joseph Davies, 36, was today jailed for a minimum of 22 years at Manchester Crown Court for the murder of his ex-girlfriend Kelly Davies.

Davies had fled the country by Eurostar after he stabbed Ms Davies in the throat and neck 22 times during a row at her home in Bolton.

Joseph Davies, right, today received a life sentence for the murder of Kelly Davies, left. He stabbed Ms Davies 22 times just one day after being released from prison for burglary.

But police were preparing to hunt for Davies abroad, he got drunk and staggered into the path of a tram at the Hague and was crushed under the wheels.

He was so badly hurt that his right leg had to be amputated at the knee – and when he woke up in hospital, Davies found himself under arrest for murder. He was later extradited to England to stand trial.

A court heard that after the murder of 31-year-old Kelly Davies – who has the same surname name as her killer by coincidence - her small daughter was found clutching her doll and standing by the body of her mother, where she had lain dead for up to two days.

Davies killed his ex-girlfriend the day after he had finished a prison sentence for burglary.

The court heard he was freed from Haverigg prison in Cumbria on the morning of June 1 last year and travelled to Bolton to meet Ms Davies, with whom he had three children during a stormy long-term relationship.

Ms Davies had been told by authorities that she would not be able to take her care of her youngest child, then aged 18 months, if she continued her relationship with Davies.

Family friend Vincent Walmsley told jurors that Davies had accused Kelly of seeing other men while he was in prison, and had threatened to ‘chop her up and throw her in the river.’

He found her dead in her flat on June 4, and tests showed that she had been dead for two days.

The court heard the killing had occurred on June 2 shortly before Davies was seen leaving her flat at 11pm and getting in a taxi to Manchester Airport.

He then paid £400 for a taxi to London, 
where he caught a Eurostar train to Lille. He was arrested on June 8 
after officers were told about his accident with the train.

After the case Elizabeth Reed of the Crown Prosecution Service said: ‘Joseph Davies thought that he could evade capture by fleeing to Holland following his brutal attack on Kelly Davies, leaving their daughter in the house with her mother’s body for two days.

'The CPS has worked hard with the police and the Dutch authorities to ensure that Davies was brought back to this country to face the charge of murder.

'Today, justice has been served and the defendant must now face up to the consequences of his horrific crime.

'Senior Investigating Officer Andy Tattersall said: “This is a tragic case that has left three children without a mum. Davies is a violent bully who attacked and killed the mother of his children and the woman he professed to love.

'He thought he could run away and not face the consequences of his barbaric actions.'
