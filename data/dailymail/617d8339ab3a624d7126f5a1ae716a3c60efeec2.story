Prince William is expected to begin a job as an air ambulance helicopter pilot

Prince William is expected to begin a job as an air ambulance helicopter pilot that will allow him to be a hands-on dad.

It is understood William will start the 
£40,000-a-year job in September after completing a short period of 
training and will work a four days on, three days off shift pattern.

Kensington Palace officials are expected to confirm within the next few weeks that Prince William has postponed taking on full-time royal duties to work as a helicopter pilot with East Anglian Air Ambulance, based near Anmer Hall. 

As a result, sources say his wife and son will spend a large part of each week at Anmer, on the Queen’s Sandringham estate, where William will be able to be a hands-on dad.

Royal Communications declined to comment last night. 

William is believed to want his own son to experience the same carefree, rural childhood he enjoyed at the various royal country residences.

Both he and Kate have complained of feeling ‘trapped’ in their 22-room apartment at Kensington Palace.

Tomorrow George will also be treated to a birthday party at the palace.

The first 
official birthday photo of George shows him marching around the 
Sensational Butterflies exhibit at the Natural History Museum earlier 
this month.

Although
 it is not unheard of for babies to start walking at ten months, many do
 not have the confidence to get to their feet until 16 months, meaning 
George is well ahead of many of his contemporaries.

He
 certainly looks more sure of himself than his father did in photos 
released to mark Prince William’s second birthday in 1984 – though the 
family resemblance, and a rather similar wardrobe, is clear.

George’s
 birthday celebration comes at the start of a busy period for his 
parents, beginning with the move to their ten-bedroom mansion in Norfolk
 late next month.
