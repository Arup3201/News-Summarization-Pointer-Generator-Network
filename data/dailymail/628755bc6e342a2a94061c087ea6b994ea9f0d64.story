Most of us are familiar with the Kate effect and the rush to the shops that ensues after the Duchess of Cambridge is spotted out and about in a chic ensemble.

But it seems that the Queen has an equally impressive an effect on sales after Launer, the leather goods company that makes Her Majesty's trademark boxy bags, revealed that purchases have doubled over the last year.

Sales of the Â£1,095 bags increased by 52 per cent with the monarch cited as the driving force behind the surge.

Although the Queen usually plumps for simple black patent, the last year has seen her step out clutching bags in a rainbow of different hues and a variety of sizes.

While the Queen usually carries the Traviata style, Launer say that the smaller newly-launched Judi style is also set to do well, as are metallic versions of the monarch's trademark bag.

'Launer continues to embrace more colour and design-led collections more than ever before, sales in colourful handbags have exploded both domestically and internationally this year,' added Gerald Bodmer, CEO of Launer.

While royal fashion fans can, for a consideration, get their hands on similar bags to those toted by the Queen, getting hold of pieces from the rest of her wardrobe is more of a challenge.

The majority of the Queen's clothes are bespoke, with many designed and made by dresser Angela Kelly.

Although Kelly is behind much of the royal wardrobe, the Queen is also fond of couturier Stewart Parvin who creates pieces to order from his London atelier.

Hats, meanwhile, also come courtesy of Angela Kelly, while the Queen's trademark jewels tend to be family heirlooms.
