Police have issued video images of two robbers who threatened Post Office workers at knife point.

The men, brandishing a knife and machete, forced one man to lie on the floor while a woman tending the till was forced to hand over cash.

The attack happened at around 8.10pm on Friday August 24 at the High Crompton Post Office, Thornham Road, Oldham, near Manchester.

The machete-wielding robber threatened the woman on the Post Office til while wearing a balaclava with tights over the top

The terrifying ordeal, which left both victims psychologically affected, was captured on the Post Office CCTV.

The knife-wielding robbers are still at large and police have released the footage and are appealing for any witnesses or anyone who recognises the men to come forward.

The footage shows the men arriving and leaving in a black Ford Focus.

Police said the machete-wielding man is around 5ft 7-8 and of medium build. He was wearing a black three-quarter length coat with a white design on the 
upper left sleeve. His face was covered with tights over a 
balaclava.Â

The other man was around 6 ft, of large build and was wearing a red hoody with white writing on the 
front. He also had tights over his head. He was carrying the large knife.

Detective Constable Emily Palmer, of Oldham CID, said: 'Anyone viewing 
the CCTV images will share our dismay at the level of violence metered 
out by these robbers.

'Anyone going to work in a local shop should never be subjected to this 
kind of ordeal but I can reassure the victims that we are confident that
we will catch up with these offenders

The second shop assistant was threatened by another knife-wielding man and forced to lie on the floor

'I would ask people to take a good close look at the CCTV pictures and let us know if you recognise these males.'

Anyone with information is asked to call Oldham CID on 0161 856 8951 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
