Patsy Kensit has opened up about her hell of going through an early menopause.

The former model and actress appeared on ITV's This Morning today to share her experiences and to urge viewers to 'cut menopausal women some slack'.

Patsy decided to go back on the show after an appearance last October left many viewers fearing for her health.

Frank: Patsy Kensit appeared on ITV's This Morning today to share her experiences of an early menopause - and to reassure other women that 'things do get better'

Worries: Patsy decided to go back on the show after an appearance last October (pictured) left many viewers fearing for her health. The actress looked confused as she slurred through her interview - and later blamed the menopause

Speaking to hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby in October, she appeared to be rambling and confused - leading some viewers to accuse her of being drunk. 

At the time, she put her behaviour down to her hormones going haywire and adjusting to hormone replacement therapy.

The actress was forced to have an emergency hysterectomy after doctors discovered two tumours in June last year. 

The 45-year-old, whose mother
 Margie lost a 20-year battle with cancer when Patsy was just 24, 
admitted the tumours were so big that they made her look as though she 
was seven months pregnant.

That immediately led to the beginning
 of her menopause at 45-years old, where then she was given replacement 
oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone to take ever since.

She told viewers during her interview last October:  'I had to have a 
hysterectomy two months ago. I was getting these huge cysts I had one 
removed in 2011 and within nine months two huge cysts had come back.

'Now I'm going through full blown menopause. My mouth is dry, I have the sweats. 

'No
 one talks about it. It's somehow taboo like you're not a woman any 
more. Do you lose your lust for life because you've lost your womb?

Advice: Patsy with This Morning's resident GP, Dr Chris Steele. The actress urged loved ones of women going through the menopause to 'cut them a bit of slack'

Happy: The mother-of-two added: 'I have to say I feel better than prior to the procedure... it's like I've been given a second bite at life'

Today, she told Holly and Phillip: '[The menopause] is a taboo subject that has a stigma and people don't want to discuss it.'

She explained that her erratic behaviour last year had been due to her trying to get her hormones balanced.

She said: 'I only wish I'd been more informed and known more about it.

'At times, my mind just seems to 
snap and I lose my train of thought. I’ll go into the supermarket for a 
packet of fish fingers and come out with a pair of tights and a cabbage.
 I’m laughing about it now, but it’s really tough because, aside from 
anything else, you’re asking yourself, "Am I less of a woman now?" ’

She explained that the morning when she 
appeared on the show last October, she had suffered from sickness and had her testosterone cream 
'which I loved' taken off her as she was using too much.

Ally: Patsy told hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby: 'If one person sees this and is reassured that they can get through the menopause, then I'm glad I came on'

This meant her hormones weren't as balanced as they should have been.

Speaking about her symptoms, she said:
 'I've been acting since I was a child, so when that was failing me...[I
 knew something was wrong].

She
 told viewers: 'this is for women with a dry mouth, or who want a bucket
 of water thrown over them [due to hot flushes]: Cut them some slack, 
please!

She also commented on the injustice of middle age that 'men buy a red sports car and women have to go through this'.

She added that part of the problem was that, unlike the U.S., people in the UK don't talk about the menopause.

She said: 'That morning, I knew I wasn't feeling myself. I probably should have cancelled, but I had a book coming out and didn't want to let you guys down.'

The mother-of-two added: 'I have to 
say I feel better than prior to the procedure... it's like I've been 
given a second bite at life.

She went on to thank 'all the women 
who were so kind' - and reassured her that 'it does get better'. 'At the
 time, I didn't believe them,' she says. 

'[Now],I feel more like a woman - I've gone through so much and feel so much wiser.

'If one person sees this and is reassured
 that they can get through it [the menopause], then I'm glad I came on -
 and will lay my womb to rest,' she joked.
