Created by Heidi Thomas, it was based on the best-selling memoirs of former nurse Jennifer Worth, who died shortly before the first episode was broadcast.

Ben Stephenson, BBC Drama commissioning controller, said: 'Call The Midwife is one of the UK’s most popular dramas and in series 4 Heidi Thomas’ writing meets new heights.'
