Colonel Richard Kemp, who led UK forces in Afghanistan, claimed allowing women into battle would 'put lives in danger'

Women lack the 'killer instinct' to serve in frontline combat operations, a retired British army commander has warned.

Colonel Richard Kemp, who led UK forces in Afghanistan, claimed allowing women into battle would 'put lives in danger'.

Ministers are expected to announce they are ready to lift the long-standing ban within weeks, but critics say it risks damaging the fighting capabilities of the armed forces.

In May this year Philip Hammond, then the Defence Secretary, said it was time for the Armed Forces to abandon the 'macho' image and show they were open to everyone who was fit enough. 

He said the US, Canadian and Australian armies allowed women to serve in combat roles – and so should Britain. He ordered a review into who can take combat roles, which is expected to report shortly.

But Mr Kemp accused Mr Hammond – who is now Foreign Secretary – of pursuing a 'transparent political agenda'.

Writing in The Times, he said: 'Prioritising political correctness and a misguided idea of equal opportunities can only serve to undermine fighting effectiveness and put lives in danger.'

He said it was the machismo in the forces which Mr Hammond 'seems to despise so much' which was needed when troops must make the decision to 'kill or be killed'.

'Infantry close combat demands ferocity, aggression and killer instinct. These characteristics are far more common in men than women,' he said.

'Even in the high-tech 21st century, 100 years after the outbreak of the First World War, the infantry soldier's ultimate purpose is still to get out of a trench and charge into the teeth of enemy fire: to close with the enemy and kill him face to face with bullets, bayonets, grenades and if necessary in hand-to-hand combat.'

He questioned how many women would take up the chance to transfer to frontline combat roles in the infantry.

'Physically and emotionally, few women will have the aptitude to join the combat arms and perhaps even fewer will want to do so,' he added.

Women can find themselves on the frontline and extremely close to the enemy while serving as medics, intelligence specialists, artillery spotters, logisticians or signallers.

However, they remain barred from all infantry battalions and Royal Marine Commando units – including Special Forces – and from tank regiments and other armoured units.

Theoretically, women would be allowed to join the Special Forces, such as the SAS. But to do so they would be expected to pass the unit's gruelling mental and physical selection process. 

The Ministry of Defence stressed that the final review has not yet been completed.

A spokesman said: 'The review process into women in combat roles is ongoing: no decisions have been made and so any suggestion to the contrary is inaccurate. As such, it would be wrong for the department to comment further at this stage.'
