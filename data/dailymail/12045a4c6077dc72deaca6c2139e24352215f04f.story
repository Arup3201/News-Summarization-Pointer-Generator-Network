Disgraced former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn referred to women as 'material' as he arranged to meet them for orgies at a 'secret' Paris flat, a court heard today. 

Asked why he needed the apartment just a few miles away from his family home, the 65-year-old said it was to meet political allies and girlfriends, adding: 'It's as simple as that.' 

The 65-year-old, popularly known as DSK, is facing up to 10 years in prison and a fine of more than £1 million for aggravated pimping.

On his third day in the witness box, Strauss-Kahn continued to defend himself against lurid allegations that he was a 'brutal' pimp who regularly abused the women he paid.

He said he regretted the use of the term 'material' in text messages with Fabrice Paszkowski, one of 13 other men on trial with him. 

Another text message read: 'Absolute discretion a must, but she's a tidy bit of work and very sexy'. 

DSK, who was married to the art heiress and journalist Anne Sinclair at the time, admitted 'libertine' parties took place at the flat, which he rented in a friend's name, 'but I didn't organise them'. 

By saying it was Paszkowski organising the girls, DSK was supporting his defence that he had no idea the women were prostitutes.

Yesterday Strauss-Kahn  told a court women 'offering themselves to him' was 'nothing unusual'.

'I was one of the world's most powerful men. Many people wanted to please me. Women have offered themselves to me ten times. It is nothing unusual to me,' he told the courtroom in Lille, northern France.

His boast followed claims from a former prostitute that the former IMF chief paid her £1,500 to fly to the organisation's Washington HQ with him.

The judge asked the woman, referred to only as Jade, why she had agreed to the trip  in January 2010.

She replied: 'For 2,000 euros! I am not going to say no. I love travelling. I had never seen Washington.'

She said she was delighted to have posed for a picture with DSK in the IMF office.

Prostitution is not illegal in France, but procuring women for sex is, and Strauss Kahn has three days in the witness box to offer his side of the story. 

He denies all the charges. 

The case is known as 'The Carlton Affair', after the luxury hotel in Lille where prostitutes were meant to have been coordinated. 

DSK admits attending the sex parties, but insists he was too preoccupied with his work at the IMF to consider paying the women involved.

He was also considering running for the position of French President, and had problems at the time with his now divorced wife, Ms Anne Sinclair, he claims. 

The case continues

Half-way through his three-week trial for aggravated pimping, Strauss-Kahn has been forced under days of questioning to explicitly detail his history of, in his own words, his 'libertine' sexual practices.

While much of the courtroom testimony is raunchy, here is a PG-selection of some of the attention-grabbing testimony so far:  

'It was a slaughterhouse. They were lying on the mattress in all directions. It was a rather degrading scene. 

'I didn't know whether these people had showered. I didn't want any part of it.'

'That's him, but with his clothes on.'

'Jade' testifying about how she only realised Strauss-Kahn's identity after she saw him on television sometime after one of his orgies. 

'We met 12 times in four years. It wasn't the frenetic, unbridled activity that the investigating magistrates' report makes out. 

'At the time, I mention without pretension, I had other things to do.'

Strauss-Kahn in response to questioning over the frequency of his orgies during the period in which he is accused of organizing a prostitution ring. 

'What can I say? It's nothing to be proud of, but there have been 10 times that I've found myself in a situation where a woman threw herself at me.'

Strauss-Kahn in response to questioning about why he didn't suspect the women he spontaneously had sex with in a restaurant basement were prostitutes. 

'I had a very hectic life, with just a few outlets for recreation, and these sessions were part of that.'

Strauss-Kahn explaining how the function of IMF chief limited his occasions for sex parties. 

'People say that at these soirees, the girls were gifts, but in fact at these parties the gift was Dominique Strauss-Kahn.'

'That's certainly what some people think, and I believe the IMF saved the world from a crisis that could have been as bad as that of 1929.'

'I dare you to distinguish between a prostitute and a naked socialite.'
