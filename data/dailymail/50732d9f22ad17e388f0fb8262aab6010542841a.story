Burnley loanee Nathaniel Chalobah remains convinced he can break into the Chelsea side once he returns from his spell at Turf Moor.

The 19-year-old has proven his worth in the Championship following spells with the likes of Watford and Nottingham Forest, in particular impressing at the former.

The youngster is now hoping for a productive loan spell at newly-promoted Premier League outfit Burnley to be the catalyst for him to stake a claim for a first-team spot at Chelsea.

He told Sky Sports: 'The loan puts us both in a good position, me and the club, we've just got to see how things go.

'I'm a Chelsea player and I'm always going to have that belief I can play for Chelsea, that's not going to change. At the end of the day, there are world class players there at the minute and I'm still really young.

'I'm trying to learn as much as I can with all the loans I've had and take as much experience as I can out of it. 

'Chelsea is my club though and I think for every player that's there, there is always the opportunity and I will always have that belief.

'For me coming up here now, I have to think less about Chelsea at the minute and just focus on Burnley because this is where I'm at until January, and possibly a bit longer, so I need to concentrate on Burnley.'
