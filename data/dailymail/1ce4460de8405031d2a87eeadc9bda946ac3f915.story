Banksy cancelled Wednesday's work due to 'police activity' but he was back painting the streets of New York today, with a fresh piece on the side of a Hell's Kitchen stripclub.

The graffiti - a man in a tuxedo solemnly holding a bunch of drooping flowers as though he's just been stood up - was discovered early this morning on the roller door at the Hustler Club at 641 West 51st Street.

His caption reads: 'Waiting in vain... at the door of the club.'

Back to work: Banksy cancelled Wednesday's work due to 'police activity' but he was back brightening up the streets of New York today, with a fresh piece, pictured, on the side of a Hell's Kitchen strip club

Club owners quickly enlisted the help of their security guard Jesse Wright to protect the piece while they determine how best to preserve it.

According to the Gothamist, Wright has been letting Banksy fans pose with the piece 'if (they) ask him nicely.'

Today, is the 24th day of the British street artist's month-long open-air residency in New York City, Better Out Than In. There are only 7 days left.

The Hustler Club's New York Marketing 
Director, Steve Karel, told Gothamist this afternoon: 'We're honored 
that Banksy chose the Larry Flynt's Hustler Club New York to share his 
art.

'We respect the art and artist; while we'd love to leave the work in place, it's required we lift the gate when we open for business, so after the public has the day to enjoy it, we will remove the door to keep it safe from vandals until we determine where it can be displayed in the future—hopefully inside of the club.'

Bansky revealed NYPD officers aching to catch him had halted his activity for at least one day.

The world-renowned street artist cancelled Wednesday's artwork after New York officials urged people to file 
complaints against the London-based man of mystery and boosted NYPD patrols looking for graffiti.

The announcement was made late Wednesday morning on his website: 'Today's art has been cancelled due to police activity.'

Early rumors swirled around the city 
that the anonymous artist had been arrested, but those were shot down by
 an NYPD spokesperson who spoke to Gothamist.

The
 website has announced the locations of each day's work for his 'Better 
Out Than In,' graffiti spree across the city this month.

No further details were given.

Just last week, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg bemoaned Banksy's month-long 'residency' on the city's streets.

'Nobody's
 a bigger supporter of the arts than I am,' the mayor told media. 'I 
just think there are some places for art and some places where… no art.'

'Running
 up to somebody's property or public property and defacing it is not my 
definition of art,' the billionaire mayor continued. 'Or it may be art, 
but it should not be permitted, and I think that's exactly what the law 
says.'

Banksy fever took over New York as soon as the first bit of street art—a stencil of two boys stealing an actual anti-graffiti sign—hit the city as part of the artist’s month-long street show.

Veles is not the first to profit from the class crusader's work.

When a painting of a beaver popped up on an east New York wall, some men threw a pizza box over it and started charging people $5 each to see and photograph it.

But he might be getting the richest from the found art.

'A big gallery truck pulled up and offered me money. He gave me a card,' Veles told the New York Post.

Veles said a female collector was desperate for the work, but 'I don't want to say more,' he said.

Just hours after it appeared, the statue was being pulled from the ankle-deep stagnant puddle it stood inside.

As a truck backed toward it, some people in the crowd yelled 'all the way!' in an apparent call for the sphinx to be destroyed rather than carted off.

Sold: Just hours after it was sighted, the sphinx was sold by the owner of a nearby auto-glass shop named Bernardo 'Choco' Veles for an unknown sum

Veles said that an unidentified art collector desperately wanted the piece and she was swift in scooping it up. 'I don't want to say more,' he said.

One of Veles' workers even sold a brick out from under the sphinx for a hundred dollars.

'You don't own it,' screamed Darwin Requena from the crowd.

'Are you looking to start something,' the worker said in Requena's face.

'I don’t want to fight,' said Requena. 'We just want to take pictures and you're blocking it.'

Banksy's website has been documenting, and sometimes commenting on each of his one-per-day pieces.

For October 22, the site read, 'No turn unstoned. A 1/36 scale replica of the great Sphinx of Giza made from smashed cinderblocks.You're advised not to drink the replica Arab spring water.'

On Saturday, Banksy painted a picture of a boy about to smash a water sprinkler with a hammer, titled  'Better Out Than In', on the Upper West Side. Saul Zabar, of the famed grocery store family, has helped add protective Plexiglass, to preserve the artist's work on his family's building on West 79th St
