The heavily pregnant mother of a baby whose body was found buried in a yard in January was released from jail yesterday so she could give birth to her fourth child.

Brittney Sierra, 22, from South Florida, was jailed in January for child neglect resulting in bodily harm after police found the skeletal reamins of her five-month-old son Dontrell Melvin buried in the back yard of her former home.

The charges were downgraded yesterday to simple child neglect. She faces ten years in prison if convicted.

Despite visiting the family's home up to 30 times, child welfare officials did not notice Dontrell was missing for 18 months.

Brittney Sierra and Calvin Melvin Jr. both blamed each other for the death of their five-month-old son, Dontrell, whose skeletal remains were found buried in the back yard of their former home

Eventually, Sierra led them to the 
baby's grave. The baby's father Calvin Melvin, 28, was also arrested on 
child neglect charges.

The judge yesterday agreed to reduce Sierra's $100,000 bail  to nothing.

The conditions of her bail are that she remains confined to the house, wears a
GPS monitor, has no contact with Melvin or any unsupervised visits with
children under the age of 18, the Miami Herald reports.

Sierra will stay with a woman who heard she was about to give birth, took pity on her and offered to take her in.

Yolande Georges, was in court on Monday to assure the judge that Sierra was going to her Fort Lauderdale home.

Defense lawyer H. Dohn Williams said Ms Georges passed a background check
and is able to provide Sierra with a stable and secure environment as 
she awaits trial.

But, according to the Miami Herald, she had a change of heart after the court hearing once she heard what Sierra has been accused of and said she only took her in as a favor to her mother Renee Menendez.

'I’m not involved in this at all anymore,' she said. 'I’m a servant of God, but no one told me what this was all about. I don’t want anyone to trick me.'

She said she met Menendez three times before in recent months.

When the two women talked, Menendez pleaded with Georges to let her daughter live with her upon release from jail, saying only that Sierra is not guilty of 'the accusation'.

Sierra has two other children who have been taken into the custody of the Department of Children and Families.

A child welfare investigator from the 
sheriff's department in Broward County, where Dontrelle lived, went to 
Sierra's home in September 2012 after a woman complained to the state abuse 
hotline that the children were dirty and smelled, living in ‘horrible’ 
conditions, and that Sierra's younger sister brought a pornographic 
magazine to school and drew male genitalia.

Sierra and her two other children lived with her mother, Renee Menendez, and Sierra's four younger siblings, officials said.

The investigator also visited the 
children at school, interviewed them and determined there were no signs 
of abuse or neglect, only that the house did smell a bit.

The children 
said they were fed and well cared for, according to DCF records.

Documents released by the agency included a transcript of a call describing the deplorable 
conditions at the house in Hallandale Beach — Menendez’s boyfriend 
called the children ‘mother-----s’ and ‘bitches,’ the caller said, and 
screamed that he would ‘knock them around.’

But DCF caseworkers reported time and again that there was no need for the agency to interfere.

Although up to seven kids were 
supposed to live at the house, an investigator who visited 
the residence in September 2012 saw only the older children.

The 
official never set eyes on Dontrell, who was born in February 2011.

Child welfare officials said the 
agency had no interaction with the family while the baby was missing and
never received an abuse allegation about him.

In Dontrell Melvin's case, records also indicate the agency had 30 prior contacts with the family.

In 2011, a caller complained that 
several of the children were riding a city bus alone to school each 
morning, although they were picked up in the afternoon by their mother.

Another hotline call last week 
prompted the investigation that eventually led to the discovery of the 
remains.

That caller told hotline operators that people in the home 
smoked drugs in front of the children and that a two-year-old was 
running down the road naked and without shoes.

The unidentified caller said the 
mother's boyfriends were always around the house and that one hit the 
children, according to the call.

An investigator visited the home after
that and asked where baby Dontrell was. The father said the baby had 
been living with his parents in Pompano Beach about 20 minutes away, but the parents 
later said that was not true.

Each parent has reportedly blamed the other in the disappearance of their son, Dontrell Melvin.

State child welfare officials have taken the other two children into custody. Each was born after Dontrell went missing.

Police were still uncertain why relatives hadn't come forward before.

'Perhaps the parents were able to spin stories to different segments of
the family, that they believed the child was possibly being taken care 
of by another segment of the family,' Flournoy said. 'But they never 
connected or talked.
