Rolling in the mud without a care in the world, peeking out from beneath a blanket and kicking around with a football: it's all play and no work for these adorable baby African elephants.

But all is not what it seems as every single elephant is an orphan and one of the 101 rescued by the Nairobi-based David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust since 2001.

Many of their mothers have been killed by poachers or fallen victim to angry farmers. One baby, Ndotto, had to be rescued after getting mixed up with livestock owned by Samburu herders and following them home to their village.

Thirsty work: Baby Ashaka is given a lesson in how her trunk works. Adult elephants would usually do this but for orphans like Ashaka, humans have to step in

Yet in spite of their traumatic early months, the orphaned babies are just as playful and inquisitive as other youngsters and as a result, their human 'family' is kept very busy indeed.

Released to mark World Elephant Day, the snaps reveal that each pint-sized pachyderm has his or her own personality, quirks and traits and can be playful, shy or boisterous. 

Among the shyer babies is seven-week-old Mbegu, who was rescued after being attacked with stones and spears by villagers, furious after a local woman was killed by an adult elephant.

During the fracas that ensued, Mbegu was separated from her herd and was only saved after a group of rangers from the Naibunga Conservancy placed themselves between the enraged crowd and 
the calf.

Taken to the charity’s elephant orphanage in Nairobi National Park, the little calf has now recovered from her 
ordeal and will grow up in the care of human keepers until she is old 
enough to return to the wild.

‘Each orphan has their own tragic rescue story but their struggle of survival and zest for life is infectious,’ says Rob Brandford, director of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. 'Mbegu was rescued at a very young age so she has really taken to her carers and loves to suck their fingers for comfort.’

With Mbegu in Nairobi National Park is Barsilinga, who had a tragic start to life after his mother was shot
 by poachers. Terribly injured, the female elephant had to be put to sleep, while her calf was taken to the orphanage.

‘Sadly, Africa’s elephants are under threat from poachers for their 
ivory,' adds Brandford. Nevertheless, when he is old enough, Barsilinga and his best friend Kithaka, will be re-homed in Tsavo National Park.

For now though, his days, much like those of a human child, are a whirlwind of play, cuddles and bottle feeds. 'Each of the elephants rescued and in the care of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has
 been orphaned,' says Brandford.

'But they now have a new herd in the form of 
our unusual human-elephant family.'
