This poor pet was certainly having a day to forget after getting its head stuck between the  railings on its owner's roof.

The Labrador found itself wedged in the ornate ironwork after exercising in the roof garden in Hornsey, north London, and was stuck in the pouring rain.

Thankfully, neighbour Natalie Huitson heard the dog's panicked attempts to get free of its soggy prison and called the fire brigade.

When fire crews arrived, they were soon able to free the distressed animal from the   railings and return him to safety.

Ms Huitson said: 'He was really wet, and distressed at this point, but the fire crew were so calm and loving to the dog.'
