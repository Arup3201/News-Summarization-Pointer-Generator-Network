Five Jessops employees who posted an appeal for a new job in the window of their closed-down store have already been attracting attention from possible employers.

The group of loyal workers have apparently been ordered to remove the window display - but within just three days, job offers were pouring in for the laid-off staff.

One potential employer even offered to fly the group out to Spain to discuss the possibility of employing them.

The workers at the Warrington branch of Jessops posted photographs of themselves with the message, 'Five unemployed and loyal staff seeking work. Can you help?' in the window of their store after the firm stopped trading on Friday.

Lanza Martineta said he and his 
fellow team-members - some of whom have worked for Jessops for up to 15 
years - wanted to show the 'real faces' behind yet another blow to the 
British high street.

And it did not take long for the 
workers' inventive appeal to capture the public imagination - Mr 
Martineta, 44, told MailOnline today that 'within hours there was a 
response'.

He added: 'This morning we've had someone ring us from Spain, to fly us over there and discuss an opportunity.'

While emphasising that 'it's going to
take time' to get all the employees back into work, he expressed 
confidence that the Warrington staff would find new jobs before long as a
result of the unconventional advertising.

However, Mr Martineta warned that 
many of the other 1,370 Jessops employees would find it harder to return
to the labour market, and urged the government to do more to support 
struggling retailers.

'It's not me who's on the scrapheap,' he said. 'The personal battles have just started for each member of my store.'

He continued: 'Why can't crippling 
high street rents be subsidised by the government? When a store has to 
find the best part of Â£92,000 before it makes a profit, that adds up.

'You can introduce all the measures you want, but once a company is making losses it's forever playing catch up.

'We have had literally hundreds of 
people knocking on our door telling us how sorry we were that we were 
going. We would like to say thank you for that - but what we really want
are jobs that replace the ones we have lost.'

On Tuesday Jessops staff were seen taking down the employees' display from the shop window in Warrington.

ITV Granada reported that the firm 
had ordered that the display be removed a day after it sprang to 
national attention after being featured on MailOnline.

Around 1,370 shop staff were left jobless when Jessops closed its 187 stores across the UK last week.

Further redundancies at the chain's head office in Leicester also look likely.

Mr Martineta said their window display - which also includes a sign that reads: 'What's happening to our high streets?' - had created quite a stir in the town centre.

'It's brought quite a bit of attention,' said Mr Martineta, who said people had come in to sympathise with the team as they packed away stock and equipment inside the closed store.

The
team's collective enthusiasm for their work made the news of their fate
all the more devastating, according to Mr Martineta, who said staff 
only learned of the chain's collapse when a journalist called the 
Warrington branch for a comment.

'It
was really out of the blue,' he said. 'We had no warning. I've seen my 
colleagues crying, wondering how they are going to pay their rents.'

Mr Martineta, who in the meantime 
intends to concentrate on his professional photographic work after 
losing his position at Jessops, said this latest retail casualty 
indicated a bleak future for the British high street.

'When Comet went down I did pay it 
some attention, but it doesn't really hit you until it happens to you,' 
said Mr Martineta, adding that Jessops had struggled to compete with 
internet retailers.

'People
were coming in for our expert advice, then using that to buy stock 
online,' he said. 'I do think we could have adapted better. It is a 
crying shame.'

He also commented on the irony of HMV going into administration so soon after Jessops, saying that the local branch of the entertainment shop was 'literally a two-second walk'.

The chief executive of HMV, Trevor Moore, was chief executive of Jessops until July last year.

As Britain's only specialist camera retailer, Jessops had been a fixture on high streets nationwide for almost 80 years.

Its collapse followed that of a number of familiar high street names over the course of last year, including fellow camera retailer Jacobs in June 2012, and Comet in November.

Peacocks, La Senza and Clinton Cards also went under last year.
