A woman has walked free from jail on Tuesday morning, 16 years after strangling a 15-year-old girl to death in a plot to steal her identity.

In 2000 Caroline Reed Robertson, then 19, was jailed for 20 years after pleading guilty to the murder of aspiring dancer Rachel Barber, with a non-parole period of 14 and a half years.

The 15-year-old victim was drugged and strangled to death with a telephone cord in 1999 in Prahran, a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria.

Despite their daughter's brutal murder, the victim's parents are asking the public to give the woman responsible privacy.

Early on Tuesday morning, Robertson left the facility at Dame Phyllis Frost Centre surrounded by two people into a waiting car.

'I ask that people do not harass Caroline or her family,' read a statement from the victim's family, including her parents Elizabeth and Michael Barber.

'(Caroline) must be given the opportunity to quietly readjust to life outside of prison.'

When Robertson became eligible for parole on August 10, 2013, the victim's family fought furiously to make sure the killer was kept behind bars. 

Mrs Barber wrote a letter to Parole Board general manager David Provan asking the board to deny Robertson's bail.

The family campaigned for the murderer to spend at least 18 years behind bars.

Yet in November 2014 the Parole Board announced their decision to release Robertson from prison under strict bail conditions.

Rachel's parents now support Robertson's release - as long as she is strictly monitored when out on parole.

If Robertson was to serve her total effective sentence of 20 years in prison, she could be subject to less stringent monitoring.

The family desperately hope that Robertson, who suffers from a personality disorder, will be properly rehabilitated and supervised so she is not a danger to society.

'With the correct supervision and support she will hopefully keep to herself and not re-offend,' Mrs Barber said.

'It is absolutely essential for the benefit and safety of the community that she is monitored on her release.' 

The family still has fears about Robertson's mental state, but hope rehabilitation can protect the community.

'No one wants Caroline Reed Robertson to commit another crime. I can only hope that the Adult Parole Board of Victoria are sure she is rehabilitated, and is so without doubt.' 

It is a case so twisted yet fascinating that it inspired a star-studded 2009 Australian film, 'I Am You' (also known as 'In Her Skin'), starring Guy Pearce, Miranda Otto, Sam Neill and Rebecca Gibney. 

Robertson was the victim's former babysitter, a trusted family friend and neighbour, who lured the teen to her death by manipulating her trust.

No one realised that she was plotting to kill her beautiful neighbour and assume her identity for a new start. 

Robertson's diary entries were used by police as evidence in the trial.

'How to change in nine weeks' was written by Robertson on the front of her journal; the pages inside detail her sick plans.  

They reveal the disturbed woman's terrifying obsession with the beautiful dancer as she plotted to kill and 'disfigure' the teen.

The journal and emotional letters to her father also expose the intense self-loathing Robertson felt, which fed her to assume the identity of Rachel, a pretty, talented, well-liked dance student.

When sentencing the young woman to jail, Justice Frank Vincent told the convicted murderer was at times emotional.

'You represent a real danger to anyone who may become the unfortunate subject of your fixation,' he told her.

The Supreme Court heard that Robertson had convinced herself that after killing Rachel she could in some way assume her identity.

'It is possible that she thought she could somehow magically reinvent herself in the image of the victim,' said forensic psychiatrist Justin Barry-Walsh in a report submitted to court.

It was a grotesque, twisted crime involving two very young girls.

Rachel was a beauty with delicate features, striking emerald eyes and a lithe dancer's build.

Caroline Reed Robertson became fixated on the young girl's beauty, enraged with her own heavier build and curly hair.

Robertson had grown up disgusted by herself, frequently painting digusting self-portraits and scribbling hateful words about herself.

'Loser, unwanted, dirty, obese, funny in the head,' she wrote around one drawing when she was 14 years old.

'I don't belong anywhere in this crazy world because I'm ugly, obese, pizza face, white worm, massive nose and just plain weird.'

Robertson had a deep-rooted self loathing, as demonstrated in this self-portrait which was used as evidence in her trial. At age 14 she drew this exaggeratedly ugly image of herself surrounded by degrading words

She would write angst-filled letters to her estranged father, explaining how much she hated her life and how worthless she felt.

'I feel like a troubled, tortured, lost soul that's been thrown into an alien environment full of angels,' she wrote in a letter to her father.

But later detectives found that the diary entries became more sinister as the then 19-year-old plotted to murder her former neighbour.

She wrote about the teen obsessively, with vivid descriptions – and in the past tense, as if writing an obituary.

'Rachel was always "wild". Let run barefoot in the country. Began dating very young. Very talented at classical ballet,' wrote Robertson in her diary.

'Tried modelling… Strikingly attractive - dancer's body. Very clear pale skin, hypnotic green eyes, dyed hair lots of different colours.'

The murderer concocted a complex plan to coerce Rachel to return to the apartment Robertson lived in by herself.

Robertson told Rachel that she could make $500 if she took part in a highly confidential psychological survey, as long as she did not tell anybody about her involvement.

Trusting her family friend, she took up the opportunity and was drugged and strangled to death in Rachel's Prahran unit.

Robertson had planned every detail.

In another image Robertson drew of herself, it is clear that she has very low self confidence and is obsessed with her appearance. It is believed that jealousy and obsession was the reasoning for the murder of Rachel

One entry read: 'On the way to dance school, say that she can't tell anyone that she's meeting me as I'm not allowed to give the study results to anyone — ethics — highly confidential. Not even your boyfriend/parents ... Drug Rachel (toxic over mouth), put body into army bags and disfigure and dump somewhere way out. No car ...'

Another entry read: 'Check farm (including bag) ... Tuesday arrange bank loan ... Moving van ... Night to disguise hair ... Thoroughly clean house, and steam clean carpet.'

Robertson had a name chosen, 'Jem Southall', which she would adopt after she took out a bank loan and fled the state.

For around two days, Rachel's body was hidden in Robertson's apartment.

As Rachel's devastated family desperately searched for their daughter, Robertson wrapped the body in two rugs and took a taxi to her father's Kilmore farm, telling the driver she was moving a statue.

Rachel's body was buried in a shallow hole, bizarrely positioned next to the grave of the murderer's pet. 

Not long after, Robertson was arrested by police. She confessed to the murder and 12 days later Rachel's body was found - the cable used to kill her still tightened around her neck.

Caroline's brutal crime was depicted in a film (pictured) called 'I Am You'. It is also referred to as 'In Her Skin'

When sentencing Robertson, Justice Vincent ruled that the culprit had a deeply entrenched personality disorder.

He told the court that he was not convinced Robertson had 'developed any real insight into the true significance of what she has done.'

However whilst incarcerated the teen killer has reportedly reinvented herself, according to the Herald Sun.

Robertson has allegedly found Buddhism, is liked in jail and 'fits into Deer Park Institution so well.'

'She finds it a better life than she ever found outside,' defence barrister Colin Lovitt, QC, told the Herald Sun.

The Herald Sun also reports that whilst in jail, Robertson formed a lesbian relationship.

The prisoner has lost a lot of weight and completely changed her image whilst in jail.

She will be released under strict bail conditions.

In 2013, the victim's parents confirmed that they have forgiven their daughter's killer. 

‘It has taken time but Mike and I have forgiven Caroline,' Mrs Barber told SMH.

'If we continued to hate her, we would be angry and bitter and I can’t do that to my own children.’
