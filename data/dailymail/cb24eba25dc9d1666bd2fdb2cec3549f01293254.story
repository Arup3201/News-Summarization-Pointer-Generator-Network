Thief: Doris Marie Payne, pictured, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of felony larceny after trying to steal a $40,000 ring in Palm Desert, California

An 83-year-old woman whose glittering career as an international jewellery thief spans five decades is back behind bars.

Doris Marie Payne was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of felony larceny after allegedly trying to steal a $22,000 ring in Palm Desert, California.

Payne is the subject of the documentary, 'The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne,' and the story of her exploits at some of the world's finest jewelry stores will soon become a major feature film.

She has been jailed in several states and claims to have shoplifted jewelry from New York to Monte Carlo.

She was released from prison this year after serving 2 1/2 years of a 5 1/2 year sentence for stealing an $8,900 ring from a department store in San Diego.

In June 2011, she pleaded no contest to stealing a $16,000 ring from a Santa Monica store and was sentenced to 16 months in prison.

In a 2008 Los Angeles Times report she said she was in her late 20s the first time she stole a diamond and has lost count of how much jewelry she has nabbed.

She said in the documentary that her 
'methodology of stealing jewelry took me all over the world... New York,
Milan, Paris Rome, London.'

In
a 2011 court appearance, however, she told a judge she had never 
gloated about stealing as she 'never saw anything to gloat about.'

Payne is accused of lifting the luxury ring from El Paseo Jewelers on October 21, according to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department.

Staff at Saks Fifth Avenue on El Paseo Drive spotted Payne in their store and sent out an alert to neighboring businesses warning them she was potentially on the prowl.

The store's manager, Raju Mehta, told Mydesert.com that Payne entered El Paseo Jewelers and identified herself as 'Audrey' before asking to see various high end jewels.

Still got it: Payne, pictured left aged 75 and right aged 79, was only released from prison this year before she tried to steal again

He said she told him she wanted to make a purchase because her other jewelry had been stolen and said she had an insurance check for $40,000.

Payne asked him to show her multiple pieces of jewelry and he said she took the ring while he was looking the other way.

Payne is being held on $45,000 bond. She is due back in court next week after waiving her right to an arraignment Thursday.
