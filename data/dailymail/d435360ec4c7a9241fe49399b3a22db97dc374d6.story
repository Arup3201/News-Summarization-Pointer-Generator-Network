It started out as a tiny aeroplane manufacturing company in Seattle trying to push the boundaries of the emerging aviation industry in the middle of the First World War.

Today, as it celebrates its 75th anniversary of trading in Britain, Boeing is known the world over as the market leader of the aviation world.

But while most will associate the Boeing with commercial jet liners, the company played a critical role in Britain's efforts during World War II.

Where it all began: Britain purchased its first ever plane from Boeing, The North American Harvard, in June, 1938, for aerial reconnaissance and training

Hard at work: Aviation experts put together a Harvard in the late 1930s for the British military

History: Boeing's production of the Harvards, pictured, started a 75-year-long relationship with Britain that is still going strong today

Britain first turned to Boeing in June 1938, when the Air Ministry purchased 200 Harvard training aircraft from its legacy company North American.

Since then, Boeings have dominated Britain's skies, supplying jets to our airlines, as well as Chinook helicopters and C-17 transport aircraft to the Royal Air Force.

Sir Roger Bone, President of Boeing in the UK, said: 'The long-term commitment and partnership that Boeing has shared with the UK over the past 75 years has delivered a safer, more connected world.

'The UK is a critically important market, supplier base and a source of some of the world’s most inventive technology.  

Speedy transport: On March 20, 1941, the British Government purchased three Boeing 314s, pictured, for The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) for use as transport aircrafts

New line: In July 1942, Boeing began producing the Eighth Air Force in Britain, equipped with B-17Es, pictured

At war: By 1942, RAF A-20 Boston Bombers had been manufactured for Britain's air-force for World War II

'From our employees to our customers and our suppliers to our research partners, the relationship supports the UK’s Armed Forces, facilitates trade between the UK and the rest of the world and supports many thousands of highly-skilled, high value British jobs.'

Britain purchased its first ever plane from Boeing, The North American Harvard, on June 9, 1938, 
for aerial reconnaissance and training.

In March, 1941, the British Government purchased three Boeing 314s for The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) for use as transport aircraft.

The 314s became best known for carrying Winston Churchill on his intercontinental journeys.

In July 1942, Boeing began producing B-17Es for the Eighth Air Force in Britain.

Making history: In 1944, hundreds of British RAF DC-3 Dakotas, pictured, were used to transport paratroopers and weapons across the English Channel on D-Day

New way to travel: On May 27, 1960, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) introduced the Boeing 707 aircraft on its London to New York service

First time for everything: On April 25, 1971, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) operates its first Boeing 747 flight between London Heathrow and New York

The B-17s were flown by the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) throughout the American participation in the Second World War to bombard German targets in Europe during daylight hours.

The company also produced the British RAF DC-3 Dakotas which were used to transport paratroopers and weapons across the English Channel on D-Day.

Boeing has continued to produce military craft for Britain over the decades as well as new commercial liners - with its latest 'ultra-green' Boeing 787 Dreamliner making its debut earlier this year.

Boeing employs more than 1,300 people across the UK at numerous sites stretching from Glasgow to Gosport.

The company spends an annual average of £650 million in the UK with more than 250 suppliers.  

Popular: On November 3, 1998, British Airways took delivery of its 50th Boeing 747

Comeback: On July 18, 2010, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner makes its debut outside the United States at the 2010 Farnborough International Airshow

Arrival: Another aeroplane takes off in the background with the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the first to be delivered to a UK airline, taxis on arrival at Manchester Airport on May 31st
