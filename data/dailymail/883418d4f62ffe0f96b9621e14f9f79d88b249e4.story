Asda has removed four own-label brands of frozen burgers from sale following the discovery of beef contaminated with horse meat at a manufacturer in Northern Ireland.

The move is a precautionary measure and was made despite assurances from food watchdogs that it was not necessary.

The decision followed revelations that a consignment of beef containing high levels of horse meat had been found at a cold store operated by Freeza Meats of Newry.

Empty: Shelves in the frozen section of Asda in Bristol today which have been cleared of burgers

Withdrawn: Price ticket for frozen burgers on empty freezer shelves at Asda in Bristol today with handwritten message 'product withdrawn'.

The manufacturer, which makes burgers for Asda and many pubs, cafes and restaurants, appears to have been the innocent victim of an attempt to shift suspect horse meat.

It received a shipment of minced beef from a company in the south of Ireland in September, which was hoping to sell it.

Freeza Meats put the consignment in its cold store and then decided to reject it. It was then inspected and quarantined by local council environmental health officers.

Tests in the last few days have revealed that three out of 12 samples of the beef were as much as 80 per cent horse.

Two weeks ago, Asda removed a much 
wider range of frozen burgers from shelves after it emerged they were 
made by a company in the south of Ireland that was known to have 
manufactured products containing horse meat.

The firm involved, Silvercrest, made contaminated burgers for Tesco, Burger King, the Co-op and Aldi among others.

The
company that supplied the suspect meat to Freeza Meats has been named 
as McAdam Foods Services of County Monaghan. It has not yet commented on
the discovery.

Asda said: ‘Although all the science says there is no trace of horse in our burgers produced by Freeza Meats, we can’t and won’t take any chances when it comes to the authenticity of ingredients in our products. 

‘As a precaution we have taken all four frozen burger products off sale produced in that factory, and have instructed Freeza Meats to segregate and hold any frozen burgers currently in production or in their supply chain destined for Asda.’

The withdrawn products are own-label 100% Beef Quarter Pounders; Beef Quarter Pounders, packs of eight beef burgers and pack of four ‘big eat’ burgers.

McAdam Food products are an Irish meat export and wholesaling company that specialises in beef and pork wholesale products delivered throughout Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the export of meats into the UK, Germany, Denmark and much of Northern Europe. 

On the McAdams Foods website it says that the company was founded in 2005 and is run by people with extensive experience in beef and pork products.
