Accused: Cara Labus, 30, stayed in contact with two students at Jerling Junior High School in Orland Park after they graduated and  allegedly engaged in sexual acts with them when they were between 14 and 16

A junior high teacher and basketball coach in suburban Illinois was arrested Wednesday on charges of sexual abuse against two girls who were former students.

Cara Labus, 30, met the two alleged victims, who were between 14 and 16 at the time of the reported abuse, when working at Jerling Junior High School in Orland Park, prosecutors said.

The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Labus stayed in contact with the two students after they graduated, and that between December 2008 and February 2011 she allegedly engaged in  sexual acts with the two.

According WLS, one of the students spoke to a friend about the reported abuse last summer, leading to the two alleged victims meeting in person and a police report being filed in December.

District administrators in Orland Park reported that Labus left the school in 2010 before taking her current position at Hufford Junior High School in Joliet.

She was charged with four counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse on Friday and held on $150,000 bond, authorities said.

Labus was also placed on electronic monitoring at her home and told she may not have contact with either the victims or anyone under 18 unless supervised. 

Administrators at Hufford say that due to those restrictions, Labus will not be allowed to return to her position at the school indefinitely.
