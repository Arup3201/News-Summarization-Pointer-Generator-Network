The bank which bills itself as the 'world's local bank' has been accused of discrimination after shutting down accounts which belong to Syrian refugees and students living in the UK.

HSBC reportedly sent letters to some Syrian clients giving them two months' notice to find a new bank due to 'assessments of the risk'.

The move comes just weeks after HSBC warned it would close down the accounts of a number of UK-based Muslim organisations, including the mosque in Finsbury Park, London, where hate preacher Abu Hamza was based.

HSBC has been accused of discrimination after closing down the bank accounts of Syrian refugees and students living in the UK

One charity has accused the bank of 'singling out' Syrian customers and treating them as 'second-class citizens'.

But the bank told MailOnline that any move to close down certain accounts was not based on race or religion.

It said all decisions were subject to 'thorough review' and were not made without good reason.

Mohammad Isreb, who has banked with HSBC since 2006, is one customer who said his bank account was closed down.

He has a Tier 1 UK visa - the category for highly skilled workers - and said he has not received or sent any money to Syria.

He told The Independent: 'After I was sent a letter, I told HSBC that being a Syrian national is not a valid reason to cancel my account. Iâ€™ve not breached any laws.

'This is adding tremendous pressure on Syrians who are already in a difficult situation. This is stabbing Syrians in the back. The sanctions are against the Government, not the people of Syria.'

Meanwhile, Majid Maghout, a 26-year old Syrian on a student visa, said his bank account was also closed down. He told the paper it was a case of 'discrimination'.

The US, the EU, Turkey and the Arab League have imposed sanctions on Syria, which has seen many refugees leave the country since the start of the uprising in March 2011

Human Rights group Refugee and Asylum Seeker Participatory Action Research (RAPAR) and the Syrian Rethink Rebuild Society have launched a joint campaign over the issue, saying Syrian nationals have been 'unfairly targeted' due to their nationality.

They say they have 'uncovered a pattern of abuse on behalf of HSBC' in which the bank has turned down customers, closed accounts, or refused mortgages for customers because they are Syrian.

The Finsbury Park Mosque, which was previously run by hate preacher Abu Hamza, was also sent a letter from HSBC saying its account would be closed

The charity said: 'HSBC has been singling out its Syrian customers in the UK, treating them as second-class customers and abusing its power over them as their financial providers.'

The US, the EU, Turkey and the Arab League have imposed international financial sanctions on Syria.

Since the uprising in the country in March 2011, many Syrians have been living in the UK on a temporary basis for study or work.

Many had to apply for asylum and received
 refugee status to avoid returning to the war-torn country.

A spokesman for HSBC said: 'HSBC is committed to adopting and enforcing the most effective standards to combat financial crime across its operations globally.

'This includes ensuring we have appropriate policies for how we do business and with whom. This applies to customers with links to a country that is subject to international financial sanctions.

'In certain cases, an assessment of the risks involved may require ending a customer relationship.

'We do not discuss individual customers, nor do we confirm whether an individual or business is, or has been a customer, but decisions to end a customer relationship are not taken lightly, and are absolutely not based on the race or religion of a customer.'

Last month, HSBC told the Finsbury Park Mosque and other Muslim organisations that their accounts would be closed in September.

Khalid Oumar, trustee of Finsbury 
Park mosque in north London, accused the bank of an 'Islamophobic 
campaign' against Muslim organisations.

The Ummah Welfare Trust, based in Bolton, and the Cordoba Foundation thinktank also received near-identical letters saying their services fell 'outside of our risk appetite'.

A spokesman said race and religion were not factors which were taken into consideration when deciding to close a bank account.
