West Bromwich Albion have opened discussions with Djurgardens over a deal for teenage Swedish midfielder Filip Tasic.

The 16-year-old had trials at Arsenal earlier this year and has since attracted further interest from Malaga, Valencia and Schalke.

Back in February, Tasic completed a short spell at the Gunners' academy and met up with idols Mesut Ozil and Jack Wilshere.

Speaking to dif.se, he said: 'It was powerful. Ozil is my idol so when I got to meet him, it was incredible. Yet I did meet all the first team players every day at the training ground when they were in, for example, the restaurant and the pool.

'The most sociable was Jack Wilshere. He always came down and talked with the young players and gave advice and tips.'
