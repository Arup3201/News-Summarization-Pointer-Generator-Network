What makes a film scary divides opinion - some people prefer tense psychological thrillers, while others want jumpy, edge-of-their seat emotional rollercoasters.

In an attempt to put an end to this debate, Japanese-owned website Rakuten's Play.com asked people to vote on which horror films they considered to be the most terrifying.

They then wired a selection of viewers up to heart monitors and tracked changes in their pulse to determine exactly which of the top movie moments got their hearts racing the most.

The winner was the iconic 'Here's Johnny' scene from 1980 film The Shining, which made pulses race and jump by 28.21 per cent.

The Shining, and its 'Here's Johnny' scene made pulses race the most, making them jump by 28.21 per cent

A Nightmare on Elm Street had the 
greatest physical effect overall, increasing audience members’ heart rates by 
26.8 per cent on average, but the poll results combined with the individual scariest scene scores put The Shining on top.

During September 10,000 Rakuten’s Play.com customers voted for the scariest horror films of all time, with Stanley Kubrick's classic The Shining coming out on top.

The 1973 religious thriller The Exorcist came second, while Wes Craven's original Nightmare on Elm Street from 1984 was in third place.

To identify the scariest scenes and 
scariest film overall, Rakuten’s Play.com analysed spikes in heart rates
 during each screening.

The scariest scene was calculated by 
identifying the percentage increases in individual audience members’ 
heart rates during spikes that occurred at the same time.

These were 
compared to each member’s average heart rate during each film to 
calculate the percentage increase in heart rates of each spike. These 
percentage increases were then added together and compared with other 
spikes to find the highest percentage increase of each individual scene.

Across all three films, the average heart rates increased by 25.3 per cent up to 
100.1bpm (beats per minute).

To identify the scariest scenes and 
scariest film overall, Rakuten’s Play.com analysed spikes in heart rates
 during each screening.

The scariest scene was calculated by 
identifying the percentage increases in individual audience members’ 
heart rates during spikes that occurred at the same time.

These were 
compared to each member’s average heart rate during each film to 
calculate the percentage increase in heart rates of each spike. These 
percentage increases were then added together and compared with other 
spikes to find the highest percentage increase of each individual scene.

The scariest film was calculated by 
identifying the top three spikes in each audience member’s heart rate 
during each film. The percentage increase of each spike was calculated 
by comparing it to each audience member’s average heart rate throughout 
each film.

These were added together and divided by the number of 
audience members being monitored, to give an overall average increase.

The 
peak average increases across each of the three films were at 101.8bpm for A Nightmare on Elm Street, 
101.6bpm for The Shining and 96.8bpm for The Exorcist.

Several scenes from A Nightmare on Elm 
Street were close behind The Shining's top spot, including the gruesome murder scenes of Johnny 
Depp’s character, Glen Lantz, (26.24 per cent increase) and Tina Gray (26.20 per cent 
increase).

The moment lead character Freddy Krueger, played by Robert Englund, is brought into the real world 
from Nancy Thompson’s dream sequence saw a 26.7 per cent increase.

'It’s interesting to see just how close 
the top three films’ scare ratings were:' Shingo Murakami, managing director of Rakuten’s Play.com told MailOnline.

Taking the 
overall average increase of 100.1bpm (25.3 per cent), the top three horror films
 just pushed audience heart rate’s into the light exercise zone by 
3.1bpm. 

Target heart rate for ‘light exercise’ 
calculated as 50-85 per cent of peak heart rate, based on the age of each audience 
member, as defined by the American Heart Organisation.

As part of the screening, audience 
members were asked what they considered frightened them the most. The 
response was typically spiders, snakes, ghosts, death and being buried 
alive.
