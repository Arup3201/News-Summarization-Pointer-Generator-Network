A toddler was mauled to death by at least five pit bull mix dogs in California on Monday while he was in the care of his uncle and grandmother, authorities say. 

Two-year-old Samuel Eli Zamudio was found severely injured with bite wounds in the backyard of his uncle's home in Colton, California around 5:30 p.m. Relatives said they heard no cries or screams from the baby, whom they suspect had entered the backyard through a window of the home.

'We found him outside,' Erica Vega, 23, told the San Bernardino Sun. 'He was dead, he was naked, he was dirty and his neck and face was bitten.'

Vega, who was at the home at the time of the attack, was Zamudio's future godmother. 

Officers responded to the house on the 700 block of West Citrus Avenue after receiving a 911 call reporting that someone had been killed by a dog.

The boy was transported to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton, where he died at 6:07 p.m.

Police have arrested the boy's grandmother, 42-year-old Eusulia Zamudio, and his uncle, 23-year-old Marco Zamudio, on charges of child endangerment.

Vega said the boy's parents had dropped 
him and his 7-year-old brother off at the home around 3 p.m. and then 
left to go to work.

The brothers were playing video games in a bedroom when the toddler wandered off.

There were at least 10 pit bull mix dogs (not pictured) at the home, including several that were kept inside

San Bernardino City animal control officers seized five dogs and three puppies from the home, according to the San Bernardino Sun.

Samuel Zamudio is the second toddler in as many days to die from a pit bull attack.

A toddler in Arizona was killed yesterday after getting in the middle of a fight between three pit bulls.

Two-year-old Daniel was staying with a babysitter in Gilbert for the weekend with his siblings when the fight broke out around 11am .

The 28-year-old babysitter attempted to pull her dogs off of the boy, and was also injured.
