Wildfires raged along Cape Town's famous mountains for a fourth day, destroying homes, a hotel and scorching thousands of hectares of spectacular scenery.

Firefighting teams and water-bombing aircraft were still desperately trying to curb the spread of the flames sweeping down Cape Town's southern peninsula, a mountainous spine of land running from the city to Cape Point, Africa's most southwestern tip.

It is believed the fire has already ravaged some 4,000 hectares of land - burning the flowering, shrub-like vegetation known as fynbos, part of the unique Cape floral kingdom.

Lucky: So far, there have been no reported fatalities or serious injuries due to the fire - although people have been treated for smoke inhallation

It has also destroyed or damaged at least 13 homes so far, as well as the five-star Tintswalo Atlantic Lodge, which is perched on the edge of the ocean near the fishing port and commuter village of Hout Bay.

Luckily, no one is thought to have been killed or seriously injured, but dozens of people have been treated for smoke inhalation.

Schools were closed and traffic snarled as residents awoke to a rain of ash and smoke drifting across an armageddon-like red ball of sun. 

The fires started as temperatures soared to their highest for the last 100 years of more than 40 degrees Celsius. 

As the blazes ripped along the mountainside on both sides of the famous pennisula, hundreds of residents living in the upmarket villages dotted along the Atlantic and False Bay coasts grabbed pets and valuables as they were evacuated overnight ahead of flames fanned by strong winds and record high temperatures.

Appeals for food and cash to help victims, evacuees and volunteer firefighters have had an overwhelming response, officials said.

Battle: Planes collect water from the sea and reservoirs nearby to dump on the forests in an attempt to stop the fire spreading

The mountains are home to fynbos, a type of shrub-like flora which is unique to the Western Cape

A 'RadioFirethon' on local station Cape Talk had raised more than R3million (about £166,000) by 5pm UK time. 

A German tourist staying in a rented house in the same area told eNCA television that he had a lucky escape in the early hours of Wednesday.

'I never experienced anything like this,' said the man, who gave his name only as Karl.

'When I saw (the flames) coming... I put my wife out of bed and we took what we could grab and went to the beach parking.'

The couple were then escorted to a rescue centre. 

The fires have now moved along the coast, and are threatening homes near Fish Hoek, on the False Bay side of the peninsula, said Onele Ndesi, spokesman for Cape Town Disaster Risk Management.

Just along the same stretch of coast, another fishing village had already come under threat: a sudden wind change overnight brought flames bearing down on Kalk Bay, a fishing village known for its seafood restaurants and antique shops.  

Devastating: Strong winds and high temperatures have made it difficult for firefighters to contain the blaze

Armageddon-like: The fires have transformed the usually stunning scenery into rivers of flames

However, officials were hopeful a change in the weather -including some rain - might bring some relief.

The fynbos-covered mountains and spectacular coastline are the backdrop to the annual Cape Town Cycle Tour, a 109 kilometre race around the peninsula, which is due to be held on Sunday.

The race is described as the 'largest timed cycling event in the world', and has drawn 35,000 entrants from South Africa and around the world this year.

Organisers were expected to announce this week whether the fires will force a change in the route.

Western Cape Premier Helen Zille said she was confident the fire would be out in time for the race to take place.

'It is known as the most scenic cycle tour in the world but now it will tour through some of the greatest devastation that the peninsula has ever seen, which will be heart-wrenching,' she said.
