He is notorious for remaining tight-lipped about his personal life in interviews.

And last night Davis Cup team-mate Dominic Inglot must have hoped Andy Murray would extend the same privacy to his fellow players.

Asked by Eurosport presenter Annabel Croft how the team would celebrate following victory over the United States, Murray was quick to point out that his 29-year-old team-mate has a ‘little girlfriend on the go here in Glasgow’.

Unfortunately for Inglot, he already has a girlfriend of six months at home in London.

When asked for the name of the lady in question, a mortified Inglot replied: ‘You’ve actually landed me in this. Because I actually have a girlfriend that’s going to be watching this.’

The jokey stitch-up left Murray in hysterics as the team sheepishly shuffled away from the disastrous interview.

A source close to the team last night explained that Murray was unaware Inglot has a girlfriend in London and did not know that the joke would backfire on his team mate.

But a spokesperson for the Lawn Tennis Association last night dismissed the stitch-up as ‘pure banter’. Laura Lord of the LTA said it was ‘just a bunch of guys messing around’.

Inglot, from Chiswick, was only playing his second Davis Cup match and, as a specialist in doubles, is not someone Murray habitually spends much time with although they are friends.

Last night he was said to be seeing the funny side of it after smoothing things over with his girlfriend, who has not been named.

Inglot was not out celebrating last night in Glasgow but flew straight back to London with team mates as he is due to fly out to play in America tomorrow.
