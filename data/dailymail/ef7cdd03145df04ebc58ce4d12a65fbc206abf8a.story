With a protruding chest bone and super skinny arms, this is the incredibly slim mannequin being used by high street store Whistles. 

The shocking picture was taken by a passer-by of a window display of the brand's Angel store in London. It shows the thin-looking mannequin wearing a floaty white top.

In response to this photograph, which was taken this week, eating disorder charities have called for shops to take more responsibility for setting standards.

The Duchess of Cambridge is a fan of Whistles and was pictured wearing one of the brand's burgundy dresses.

Mary George from Beat, the UK's leading charity supporting those with eating disorders, said: 'It is disappointing to see such an obviously underweight mannequin in the high street. 

'This stereotype can be extremely harmful to some and while the fashion industry doesn't directly cause eating disorders- it has a powerful influence that is highly toxic to some vulnerable young people. 

'We call on retailers to recognise the responsibility they have to use this influence in positive, life enhancing ways. Fashion can be fantastic- creative, aspirational and fun. 

'What we need is a mixture of different heights and widths of mannequins in our shops to reflect the reality of people's different shapes and sizes, heights, widths and build.'

Amina Hays, who took the photograph of the mannequin after spotting it in Upper Street brand of Whistles, said she found it 'revolting'.

The 32-year-old said: 'There has been so much uproar with the fashion industry not representing 'real' women I thought idiocies like this had been abolished. 

'I'm a size eight and this made me feel fat which is just not acceptable.'  

Marg Oaten MBE, the secretary and co-founder of SEED Eating Disorder Support Services, told FEMAIL: 'Without doubt the mannequin is not a realistic reflection of a body size and shape.

'It is outrageous to portray this as acceptable – people may aspire to this body shape whilst people with an eating disorder, may in fact consider themselves not thin enough.

Controversy: Whistles has come under fire from eating disorder charities for using super slim mannequins

'I really do think the retailers have a duty of care to its shoppers to be more realistic in the size of the model or mannequins that they use to showcase their goods.'

Marg went on to say: 'Often people who are low in self-esteem have a false belief that by managing body weight and shape they will be happier, in truth they may plummet to dangerously low levels in weight that may cause them to be medically at risk.

'People need to be comfortable in the skin they are in – and celebrate the difference in body weight and shape.

She added: 'Promoting clothing in this way can be highly dangerous to potential sufferers of anorexia nervosa. 

'An eating disorder has the highest mortality rate of any other mental health illness with a staggering 20 per cent of people dying each year from their illness or through suicide.

'Manufacturers and retailers need to take more responsibility for their actions and consider the consequences of how this may impact on people suffering from an eating disorders.'

Gina Hutchings, a part time plus model said: 'I do not think the fuller figure has made its way to high fashion yet which is sad as fuller figured women can be just as stylish as slimmer women.

'The high street usually means clothes everyone can wear so it’s disappointing to see this mannequin used by Whistles. 

'Skinny shaming is now as bad as fat shaming and as talked about but Whistles are failing to show a healthy figure.'

MailOnline has contacted Whistles for comment.

This is not the first time a high street store has come under fire for using a mannequin that is considered too thin. 

In October, Topshop was slammed for using using mannequins with stick thin legs with student Becky Hopper sharing a picture of her friend posing comparing her legs to those on the model.

The image was shared more than 7,000 times .A Topshop spokesman said the mannequin was ‘based’ on a size 10.

‘The form is a stylised one to have more impact in store and create a visual focus,’ said the spokesman.

‘Mannequins are made from fibreglass, so [they] need to be of certain dimensions to allow clothing to be put on and removed. This is therefore not meant to be a representation of the average female body.’ 

Over the last decade, campaigners have been fighting back against a series of fashion and online trends they say encourage eating disorders.

A row over so-called 'size zero' models was sparked in 2000 when the British Medical Association linked an obsession with 'abnormally thin' models on TV and in magazines with the rise in conditions such as anorexia and bulimia.

Madrid Fashion Week banned models with a body mass index below 18.5 from its catwalks in 2006 in what was seen as a victory for campaigners against size zero.

But later that year, Paraguayan model Luisel Ramos was found dead from a heart attack linked to malnutrition and six months later her sister, model Eliana Ramos, 18, died in similar circumstances.

Their deaths were used to highlight the pressure on models to meet a demand for unnaturally thin young women.

Campaigners have hit out over the use of 'size zero' models on catwalks and have linked the desire among women to emulate the so-called 'thigh gaps' of models like Cara Delevingne (right) to eating disorders

Last year, internet craze 'thinspiration' - where people post photographs of their emaciated bodies on social media to 'inspire' weight loss - was also blamed for encouraging eating disorders.

Susan Ringwood, from charity Beat, said: 'Those pictures are very unlikely to be real.

'They are digitally manipulated to make the bodies shown appear extremely emaciated. Altered pictures of famous people are often included too.'

A further craze by girls to emulate model's 'thigh gaps' erupted earlier this year when experts warned it was further fuelling the issue.

Nancy Albus, head of a facility which deals with sufferers in St. Louis, USA said: 'The intrusion and presence of social media in our lives really does make it very difficult.

'The important distinction about thigh gap is it gives you an actual visual to achieve, this visual comparison of how your body does or doesn't stack up.'
