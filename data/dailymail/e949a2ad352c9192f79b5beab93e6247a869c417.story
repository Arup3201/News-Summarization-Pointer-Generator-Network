Charged: Alison Ernst, 36, has been charged with disorderly conduct after throwing a shoe at the former Secretary of State

Authorities say a Phoenix woman accused of throwing a shoe at Hillary Rodham Clinton during a Las Vegas speech has been freed after being given a misdemeanor disorderly conduct summons.

Prosecutors said Friday that 36-year-old Alison Michelle Ernst was freed by Las Vegas police after being questioned by U.S. Secret Service agents in the Thursday incident at the Mandalay Bay resort.

As Ernst was taken into custody, she said she threw a shoe and dropped some papers. She didn't say why.

Ernst's jail booking photo shows she wore blonde wig at the time.

The 36-year-old made her way up to the stage at the Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino where Clinton was addressing a crowd at a Scrap Recycling Industries meeting.

The Las Vegas Review Journal reported that Ernst threw the shoe overhand before being taken away by security.

She also threw a stack of papers in the air and a spectator who said it appeared to be a confidential Defense Department report from 1967 that detailed an operation called 'Cynthia' that took place in Bolivia.

Ernst, whose mugshot shows has short brown hair, was pictured being escorted away while wearing a long platinum blonde wig and a figure-hugging blue and black dress.

Clinton ducked but did not appear to be hit by the object, and then joked about the incident.

'Is that somebody throwing something at me?' Clinton asked.

'Is that part of Cirque du Soleil?'

Later reports revealed that Ernst had a single shoe in her purse when she went into the event but security guards did not get a chance to ask her about it beforehand because she avoided the security checkpoints.

This is not Ernst's first run in with the law, and she appears to have a history of causing scenes around controversial figures.

Radar Online reports that Ernst, who is from Phoenix, is the same Allison Michelle Ernst who showed up at a court hearing for Aurora movie theater shooter James Holmes and started screaming.

In the August 2012 incident, she screamed at Holmes before being escorted out.

'I tried to deliver information vital to the defense of James Holmes to the public defender,' she said at the time.

She later filed a preliminary injunction for a restraining order against Holmes because she accused him of 'entering my mind though subliminal messaging and causing me to be obsessed with him on  a daily basis'.

'I sleep, eat, and think James Holmes 24/7 and I seek a restraining order to have this James Holmes mind manipulation to stop,' she wrote in the injunction.

'I watched Inception, so Iâ€™m fully aware of James Holmes magical powers... James enters my head like Dennis Quaid in inner space and he zooms my heart and plays with it and forces me to care for him.

'Holmes wonâ€™t even look at me (in court)... this offends me, my life and skin. James Holmes is being framed.

'They wanted to Tim McVay [sic] him...Much like James Holmes, [McVeigh] was a mind-controlled patsy that they dumped the blame for the bombing on,' she wrote, referencing the Oklahoma City bomber.

Though she said she was ignored by her target when it came to the Holmes hearing, that wasn't the case when she had her Thursday outburst at the Clinton event. 

'My
 goodness, I didn't know that solid waste management was so 
controversial,' Clinton said. 'Thank goodness she didn't play softball 
like I did.'

Brian
 Spellacy, U.S. Secret Service supervisory special agent in Las Vegas, 
said the woman was being questioned and would face criminal charges.

Las
 Vegas police later announced that Ernst now faces one count of 
disorderly conduct and has been released from custody. Her court date is
 set for June 24.

A black and orange shoe was recovered from the stage, Spellacy said.

Ilene Rosen, the wife of a conventioneer from Denver who was seated in the second row, said she saw an orange object fly toward the stage from a side aisle and papers fluttering in the air.

Rosen said the woman had walked down 
the aisle to within six rows of the front of the seating area, threw the
 items, turned around, put her hands in the air and walked toward the 
back of the room. Security officers quickly caught up with her.

In the hotel hallway, the middle-aged
 blonde woman sat calmly on a sofa, wearing a blue dress and thong 
sandals. She said she threw a shoe and dropped some papers, but didn't 
identify herself to reporters or explain the action. Security officials 
then ushered reporters and photographers away.

Spellacy
 and Mark Carpenter, spokesman for the recycling institute, said the 
woman wasn't a credentialed convention member and wasn't supposed to 
have been in the ballroom.

After her speech, Clinton answered questions posed by Jerry Simms, the outgoing chairman of the organization. Simms first offered what he called a 'deepest apology for that crude interruption.'

Clinton answered questions broadly, saying she felt politics today leads people to 'do what they think will be rewarded.'

An attendee later handed a reporter a piece of paper that was apparently thrown by the woman. It appeared to be a copy of a Department of Defense document labeled confidential and dated August 1967; it referred to an operation 'Cynthia' in Bolivia.

Clinton and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak were also guest speakers at the meeting of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries.

This is not the first time that a shoe has been thrown at a prominent US politician.

In 2008, George W. Bush had a pair thrown at him by a reporter while on a visit to Iraq in December 2008.
