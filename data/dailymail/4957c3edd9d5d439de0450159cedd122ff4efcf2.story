A rival car service company says Uber has been using some less than ethical tactics to try and outmaneuver the competition in New York City.

Gett, a black car service that launched in New York's competitive on-demand transport market this fall, claims Uber employees, fearful of its rival's growing popularity, ordered and cancelled some 100 Gett cars last week.

More than a dozen Uber employees - including the general manager, a social media manager, community manager and an operations manager, were among callers identified on Gett's system.

Competitive: Gett, newly launched in New York City, has apparently rattled competitor Uber, employees of which booked then canceled more than 100 Gett cars last week

Dodgy tactics: An Uber spokesman admits that its tactics may have been too aggressive but denies engaging in any denial of service attacks, saying employees canceled reservations only seconds after they were made

Gett CEO Jing Herbert told TechCrunch that the Uber employees would wait until the cars had almost arrived before cancelling their booking.

Once the Uber employee had ordered a car, they then had access to the number of the car's driver.

TechCrunch reports that an Uber worker then sent text messages to these drivers offering money to jump ship, a tactic the company has employed with another competitor, Lyft.

A flyer distributed to Lyft drivers in San Francisco offered a $50 gas card, 100 per cent of fares until January 2014 and a $500 bonus for carrying 20 passengers before a certain date.

Uber has not denied the allegations, releasing a statement on the Uber website acknowledging the attempt to poach Gett's drivers.

'Our local teams can be pretty determined when spreading the word about Uber and how our platform opens up new economic opportunities for drivers,' reads the statement.

Gett-ing even: It is unclear whether Gett will take legal action over Uber's poaching ploy

It goes on to say that the 
reservations were canceled only seconds after they were made and that 
the company paid any applicable cancellation fees, though it does 
acknowledge that the campaign was 'too aggressive.'

Herman likened the incident to a 'denial of service' attack, saying the practice denied cars to legitimate customers.

'During
 a very short period of time when we had a hundred cancellations that 
took up a hundred drivers, those hundred drivers could have served a 
hundred of our legitimate customers who weren't able to get a car or had
 to wait much longer to get a car,' Herman told CNNMoney.

San
 Francisco-based attorney Drexel Bradshaw told CNNMoney that the company
 could face legal problems for these type of practices.

'If
 Uber employees intentionally diverted Gett drivers from legitimate 
business by making phony calls, that is an unfair business practice, 
illegal under California law,' he said. 'It is also an intentional 
interference with Gett's business which makes them liable for money 
damages.'

Questionable practices: Uber co-founder and chief, Travis Kalanick, in an Uber vehicle in front of the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge in Sydney, has never shied away from competition

The attempt to hijack Gett's drivers comes after Uber faced criticism over its price-surge model of business, which was likened by the New York Times to 'high tech price gouging.'

The model, says the company, keeps supply in line with demand. The more demand for cars, the more passengers will pay. On New Year's Eve, Twitter was awash with indignant Uber customers who were charged up to eight times the regular fare for cars on the notoriously busy night.

Jerry Seinfeld's wife Jessica Seinfeld tweeted that one night in December during a snow storm she had paid $415 just to drop her children off at their bar mitzvah and sleepover, respectively.

Gett's model is similar to Uber - only there's no price surge. The company offers customers a payment structure and flat fares between neighborhoods regardless of the time spent in the car.

Gett operates in 20 cities across the UK, Russia and Israel.
