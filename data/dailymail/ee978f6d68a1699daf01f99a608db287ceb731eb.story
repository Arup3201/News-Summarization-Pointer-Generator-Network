Neil Armstrong at the Explorer's Club:
The 82-year-old has only granted a handful of interviews since his 1969 mission

Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, has given a rare interview slamming conspiracy theorists who believe he did not travel to the lunar surface.

The reclusive astronaut decided to open his heart about the mission to an unusual source - an Australian accountancy magazine.

The 82-year-old has only granted a handful of interviews since his 1969 mission.

When asked about the conspiracy theories, Armstrong laughed and said that there's no way the 800,000 Nasa staff working on the project could have kept a secret.

‘People love conspiracy theories, they're very attractive,’ he said.

‘But they were never a concern to me, because I know someone is going to fly back up there and pick up the camera I left there.’

Conspiracy theorists claim the landings were staged as a propaganda effort for the U.S. government, and that landing on the moon would have been impossible with 1969 technology.

The Certified Practicing Accountants of Australia convinced him to film an hour-long one-on-one in which he talks about the landing and his famous first steps on the moon.

‘A month before the launch of Apollo 11, we decided we were confident enough we could try and attempt... a descent to the surface,’said Armstrong in the video which appeared on the CPA website this week after the interview last year.

‘I thought we had a 90 percent chance of getting back safely to Earth on that flight but only a 50-50 chance of making a landing on that first attempt.’

As a child, Armstrong said he had ‘become fascinated with the world of flight, as an elementary school student, and determined that,somehow, I wanted to be involved in that.’

He also said the current state of Nasa is ‘sad’,claiming: ‘Nasa has been one of the most successful public investments in motivating students to do well and achieve all they can achieve.

It is sad that we are turning the programme in a direction where it will reduce the amount of motivation and stimulation that it will provide to young people.’

CPA head Alex Malley said he suggested the idea of an interview to the space veteran when he was in Australia last year helping the organisation with its 125th anniversary, and he agreed.

‘I know something not a lot of people know about Neil Armstrong -- his dad was an auditor,’ Malley said.

‘The most compelling thing I felt about him was his humility -- his commitment to his team, his deference to everyone except himself, his respect for the Russians -- I found that quite extraordinary.’
