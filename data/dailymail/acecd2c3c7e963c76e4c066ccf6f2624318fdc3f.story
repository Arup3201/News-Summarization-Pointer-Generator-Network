FIFA executive committee member Michel D'Hooghe has described the £16,000 watches given to officials at the 2014 World Cup by the Brazilian federation as the most 'poisonous present' he has ever received.

The world governing body's medical chief was the recipient of one of 65 gift bags, each containing a Parmigiani watch, from Brazil's football federation the CBF in June, which were distributed to all 28 members of FIFA's executive committee.

FIFA's ethics committee last month said accepting such valuable gifts contravened its rules and has demanded that all the watches be returned by October 24 otherwise it will launch disciplinary proceedings.

FIFA executive committee member Michel D'Hooghe has spoken out about the controversial gift 

D'Hooghe, speaking at the Leaders in Sport conference in London, said: 'We (FIFA's executive committee) are absolutely angry on that situation. All my colleagues on the executive committee, not one of them needs that watch.

'I have been in football 42 years and received many watches in my career. It is a classical present in football, so I did not need that watch.

'They say I received that watch. It is not true. I found that watch in a bag that was placed in our room.

'It's only after one week that I opened it, I saw there was a watch with plastic bracelet and the mark 'Parmigiano' (sic).

'For me Parmigiano is a cheese that you put on spaghetti. I thought it was a kind of Swatch (watch).'

The 68-year-old Belgian, a member of FIFA's executive committee since 1988, did not appreciate the gift, insisted there was nothing untoward in its intentions, but was happy to return it.

'The Brazilians gave a present for their centenary,' he added.

'There was nothing asked in return. It was not a matter of corrupting. It was a pure present.

'What I did not like is that they gave a present of such value.

'Please never give me such presents again.'

UEFA President Michel Platini has said publicly that he will not return his luxury watch  

D'Hooghe gave his watch to an acquaintance at the World Cup and has had to ask for its return.

'I am to be humiliated towards that person to ask for that watch back,' he added.

'I asked the person to whom I gave it to give it back.'
