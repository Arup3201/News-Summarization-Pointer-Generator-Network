Property developers in Dubai are to resume building on a collection of artificial islands that form the shape of the global map. 

Construction on the cluster of man-made islands began in 2003 but was halted six years later in the wake of the financial crisis.

So far only two of the 300 islands have been developed, though work on six dubbed the 'Heart of Europe' will get underway next year.

Work is to begin again on the cluster of man-made islands in Dubai after development was halted following the 2008 economic crisis

The first European island to be built will be Germany, according to developers Kleindienst Properties.

The project titled The World was unveiled in 2003 by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and was marketed as a playground for the rich and famous.

Built using sand dredged from Dubai's shallow coastal waters, the islands lie four kilometres off the shore of Jumeirah.

Properties vary between private homes, estate homes, 'dream resorts' and community islands. Richard Branson owns the piece of land that represents Great Britain.

Though 60 per cent of the islands had already been sold to private developers in 2008, the majority of work came to a grinding halt as the emirate suffered the brunt of the worldwide economic crisis.

The region found itself $100billion in debt after enjoying years of excessive and exuberant spending, leaving deep-pocketed investors hesitant to pile money into its many development projects.

The project which resembles the world's map was begun in 2003 but had to be suspended following the 2008 economic crisis

Dubai was forced to ask the federal government of the United Arab Emirates for a loan, forcing the closure or suspension of thousands of developments that may never be completed.

Progress on construction sites indicate the city's recovery from such crisis however, with The World islands just one of the many examples of its strengthening property market.

Apartment prices rose by 42 per cent from the beginning of the year to September 30, with almost 50,000 new flats under construction, the Times reports.

Dubai's ruling family is eager to put return the city to its former state of prosperity by hosting the 2020 World Expo, which will bring about an estimated $25billion economic boost.

Around $7billion has already been put aside to build new infastructure for the event that will reportedly create 277,000 jobs and attract 25million visitors to the UAE.

The emirate's economy expanded by 4.9 per cent in the first half of 2013, with its stock exchange doubling in value and hittting a five-year high this week.
