A British family is taking legal action claiming their holiday at a five-star Egyptian resort was ruined when three of them became seriously ill.

Kay Taylor-Baldwin, 37, from Doncaster, was left on an IV drip after suffering symptoms associated with gastric illness after eating at the Thomson Sensatori Resort in Sharm el-Sheikh.

And her 35-year-old husband and one of their two sons - who have not been named - also fell ill.

The family allege they witnessed unsafe food handling standards during their £5,000 holiday to the all-inclusive Red Sea hotel last August, which they booked with Thomson Holidays. 

Kay, her husband and their eldest son had diarrhoea and stomach cramps, while she and her husband also suffered vomiting.

When she visited the hotel clinic, Kay was placed on an intravenous (IV) drip, prescribed antibiotics, and received an injection.

Kay, an NHS worker, said: 'We had been looking forward to the holiday for months, but it was absolutely horrendous as myself, my husband and our eldest son became very ill. I'm still suffering symptoms now.

'On occasions some of the food was served uncovered and I noticed food was sometimes served lukewarm when it should have been hot.' 

She added: 'I also saw food that was undercooked a couple of times which included chicken and beef.

'At one of the sittings I saw one of the chefs touch raw meat and then touch cooked meat without changing their gloves.'

Since returning home to South Yorkshire, Kay claims she has continued to suffer from symptoms of the illness, according to solicitors Irwin Mitchell.

The family has hired the law firm's international personal injury team to investigate the cause of the illness.

The family alleges they met other holidaymakers who fell ill with similar symptoms at the beachfront resort on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.

Kay said: 'We have stayed in other hotels in Egypt which were classed as four-star resorts so when we booked this we were expecting a good hotel with good food and the room we wanted and paid for.

'However, we would not rate the Sensatori as a five-star hotel and would never return there. 

'It was not just us who were affected by illness during our stay, as many other families and holidaymakers staying at the hotel were suffering similar symptoms.'

In a statement, Thomson Holidays said ‘a very small number of guests’ reported that they had been unwell with symptoms similar to a virus.

The tour operator said: ‘These guests were offered the appropriate support and advice by our overseas holiday advisors.

‘All of our hotels are subject to stringent monitoring and audits and this hotel achieved an extremely high score in its audit carried out this summer. We are unable to comment further as we understand the family has instructed a solicitor.’
