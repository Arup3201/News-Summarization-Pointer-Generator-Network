A blaze on board a packed jet forced an emergency landing at Gatwick yesterday.

The 299 passengers and 13 crew on board were evacuated using escape slides in a drama that closed the airport for several hours.

Fifteen required hospital attention, many with suspected broken bones.

Scores of other flights had to be suspended, delaying thousands of passengers.

Drama: A Virgin Atlantic Airbus A330 is surrounded by emergency services vehicles after making an emergency landing at Gatwick Airport due to a fire in the cockpit

Precautionary measure: Flights in and out of Gatwick were suspended for nearly two hours after the incident, which left 15 passengers with minor injuries

The Airbus A330 turned back just 15 
minutes into its flight to Orlando in Florida as smoke began to fill the
cabin. Some passengers accused the staff of panicking as the aircraft 
landed and its emergency chutes were deployed.

Liam Moore, a passenger, said everybody was ‘really shaken up’.

‘Everything seemed fine,’ he said. 
‘Then the pilot came on the tannoy just a few minutes into the flight 
and said we would have to do an emergency landing. It all happened so 
quickly. We landed and suddenly all the doors flung open and the 
emergency slides were inflated.

‘We then had to slide down the chutes, some people got cuts and grazes from the slide.

‘Police cars were flying up the runway. There were four fire engines, paramedics, a helicopter.’

Fire crews used powerful extinguishers to douse the flames as the Airbus stood on the runway.

All flights at Gatwick were suspended,
leaving thousands stranded and facing an afternoon of delays. The 
airport had been due to deal with 600 flights during the day.

Passenger
Tom Alridge said one of the cabin crew panicked after the  plane 
touched down: ‘She was screaming like a banshee – “Get off, get off” – 
she was literally pushing people down the chute,’ he said.

‘Someone has a broken ankle, another guy hit his head when he went down the chute.’

Another passenger, Mark Bell, from 
Bracknell, told the BBC: ‘I knew something was wrong when we took off. 
The plane was really wobbly.

‘The cabin crew made things worse. 
They were all really panicked. We weren’t told anything other than we 
had to go back to Gatwick and make an emergency landing.

‘We circled the airport twice before the landing. We were told to evacuate, evacuate, evacuate.’

Disruption: The incident caused knock-on delays to other airlines operating in and out of Gatwick (file picture), with some incoming flights being diverted

The closure is the second to hit Gatwick in three days.

On Friday, all outbound flights were briefly suspended after a hot air balloon drifted into the flight path.

A Gatwick spokesman said: ‘A Virgin 
A330 left Gatwick at 11.48am bound for Orlando but returned to make an 
emergency landing at 12.30 due to reports of a technical issue.’

The spokesman said passengers were 
looked after at a reception area. Last night the airport was open again 
and flights were expected to be back on schedule today.

Steve Ridgway, chief executive of 
Virgin Atlantic, said the flight was ‘not far out of London when the 
technical alarms went off on the flight deck’.

He said some passengers had gone home and others were travelling today. He promised an investigation into the incident.

Queues: Passengers wait in the Gatwick departure lounge following the emergency landing, which saw the airport operating a reduced service and arrivals diverted to other airports

Warning: Customers using the airport were told by airlines including British Airways and EasyJet to expect delays and disruption

She said passengers involved were being looked after in a specially set-up reception area at the airport.

Virgin Atlantic's president, Sir Richard Branson, tweeted: 'Very sorry to all passengers on board VS27.

'The staff @virginatlantic are doing everything they can to look after everybody. More info soon.'

Virgin Atlantic confirmed that flight 
VS27 from Gatwick to Orlando had made an emergency u-turn to its home 
airport and been evacuated adding in a statement: 'Due to a technical 
problem, the captain decided as a precautionary measure to immediately 
evacuate the aircraft.

'Virgin Atlantic can confirm that all 
the passengers and crew have now safely disembarked. We can confirm that
there have been four minor injuries.

'Our teams at Gatwick are now offering
full support, looking after our passengers and assisting with their 
immediate requirements.'

It added: 'Virgin Atlantic is working 
closely with the authorities to establish the cause of this incident. 
The safety and welfare of our crew and passengers is Virgin Atlantic's 
top priority.'

But the incident caused knock-on 
delays to other airlines operating in and out of Gatwick- with some 
incoming flights diverted, and others landing at Stansted Airport in 
Essex instead.

Gatwick operated a reduced service and warned passengers could expect knock-on disruptions and delays.

British Airways warned customers: 
'Flight delays, diversions and cancellations are expected so if you are 
due to travel to or from London Gatwick, please check the status of your
flight before leaving for the airport.'

And easyJet's website said its flights
were experiencing 'signification disruption' and recommended passengers
check the status of their flight before leaving for the airport.

Eyewitness Lorna Willson, 23, who 
works in a building that overlooks the runway, said she saw the 
immediate aftermath of the landing.

She said: 'I was just eating my lunch 
and I noticed the plane - they usually take off quite quickly but this 
one didn't go anywhere.

'Then I realised all the chutes were 
out and there were lots of fire engines and police. I think the 
passengers had been taken off, but you could see a few stewardesses. 
There was quite a lot of emergency services there.'

An airport staff member said: 'The 
plane is waiting on the runway. Police officers and other vehicles are 
surrounding it. It looks pretty serious, but the airport is dealing with
it well. They are not letting anyone else through security at the 
moment.

'It looks like the height of summer 
here. They have made announcements that all flights are suspended until 
3pm and there is a crowd scene.'

The closure is the second to hit 
Gatwick in three days. Last Friday, all outbound flights were briefly 
suspended after a hot air balloon drifted into the flight path.

It is the first incident involving a 
Virgin flight since 2008, when another passenger jet with 320 passengers
was forced to turn back to Gatwick Airport less than an hour into its 
journey because of a technical problem. The plane to Barbados returned 
to Gatwick to be met by fire crews after the Boeing 747 circled over 
Gatwick to burn off fuel before landing.

A Korean Airways jumbo jet made an 
emergency landing at Heathrow airport in January after a mayday call on a
transatlantic flight.

The Boeing cargo plane carrying cattle
from Chicago to Brussels issued the call over the Bristol Channel when a
fire warning light flashed on in the cockpit, before diverting to 
Heathrow for an emergency landing.
