Burnley are poised with a £3million bid for Bolton midfielder Mark Davies.

The 26-year-old has been a target for QPR in recent seasons but he had a bad injury last year and has just returned to full fitness and form. Bolton need the money and willing to listen to reasonable offers.

Davies joined the Trotters from Wolves five years ago and the midfielder has scored 14 goals in 148 appearances 

Bid: Bolton's Mark Davies could be returning to the Premier League with Burnley 

On the move: George Boyd is expected to complete a move from Hull to Burnley 

Burnley manager Sean Dyche has also made a move for Hull City midfielder George Boyd and hopes to wrap up a deal by tomorrow with Boyd agreeing a three-year deal.

Boyd signed for the Tigers 18 months ago but the forward has struggled to break into Steve Bruce's plans, being restricted to nine minutes of action in the Premier League in the first three games.   

He wasn't in Hull's matchday squad for today's 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa.  

Transfer targets: Burnley boss Sean Dyche is looking to add to his squad before the transfer window closes
