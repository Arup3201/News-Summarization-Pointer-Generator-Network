It is one of the most coveted handbags of all time, but with a price tag of around £8,000 the Hermés Birkin bag isn't quite within every fashionista's price range (unless you're Victoria Beckham whose collection is worth a reported £1.5m).

But for arm candy fans on a budget, online handmade marketplace Etsy is selling a replica version of the much lusted after bag.

There's just one catch: it is made out of Lego.

Toy bag: The tribute Birkin bag is made out of Lego and is available on Etsy.com

The 20 x 26 x 13 cm bag, which would make a great Christmas gift for stylish children, is described on the site as 'fully functional' and 'designed for everyday use'.

The £89 bag can be made to order in a variety of colours and is made from brand new lego.

Describing the item, the site states: 'All the bricks used to make it are brand
new (i.e. straight out of the box, never played with and of course only
original LEGO bricks), so the bag has this amazing shine of new 
bricks.

'It is very elegant, does not seem at all like a toy handbag.'

Spot the difference: The Lego bag (L) would make the perfect gift for fashion savvy children, while the real version (R) is worth around £8,000

Prestigious luggage and 
accessories firm Hermés, who count many of the world's wealthiest women as 
fans, is known for luxury leather accessories.

Renowned
for its immaculate finish and top quality materials, Hermès claims never to 
use any assembly lines with one craftsperson making a single handbag at a time,
hand-stitching individual pieces to create the finished product.

The
brand is rich in history, and some of its bestselling bags have 
intriguing stories behind them.

The iconic Kelly bag, one of Hermes most
popular styles, was originally known as the Sac à dépêches when it was developed by Hermes in 1935.

In
1956, a photo of Grace Kelly, who had become the new Princess of 
Monaco, was pictured carrying the Sac à dépêches to hide her pregnancy.

Famous fans: Victoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian are big fans of Hermes ... handbag Victoria reportedly owns a collection worth £1.5m

Photographs were sent all over the 
world and put on the cover of Life magazine. As a result, the bag became
known as the Kelly and has been hugely popular ever since.

The Birkin has similarly romantic roots, conceived as it was in honour of French star Jane Birkin. 

The Birkin was allegedly created after
the company's CEO Jean Louis Dumas sat next to the actress on a Paris
to London flight.

Birkin had been discussing her difficulty in finding
a leather weekend bag, explaining her ideal.

Shortly after, in 1984, the bag she
described arrived at her flat with a note from Dumas. Although nowadays the bag can be made to order, the design 
is still one of the most recognised in the fashion industry.

Perfect gift: The Lego version would make a great present for young fashion fans like Suri Cruise

And Victoria Beckham isn't the only celebrity Birkin fan.

British-born author Barbara Taylor Bradford owns an 
impressive 24 and heiress Tamara Ecclestone has specially built cupboards to house her £100,000 collection.

Katie Holmes, Julia Roberts, Hilary Duff and
Kelly 
Brook are also fans while Jane Birkin, the inspiration behind the roomy leather must-have has said she covers her 'b***** heavy' Birkin with stickers to disguise the fact
she's carrying a 'snobbish' bag.
