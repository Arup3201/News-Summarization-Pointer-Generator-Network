Builders have rubbished claims that thousands of diggers are being buried under London houses when excavation work has finished.

It was claimed the equipment is left at the bottom of the luxury homes belonging to London's super-rich - who are increasingly expanding their properties downwards to get round tight planning regulations.

The heavy machinery is needed to hollow out the ground to make way for swimming pools, cinemas, garages and other trappings of wealth. But, according to the new theory, many of the projects are so ambitious the diggers are left with no way to dig their way out again.

Construction: When basement excavations on London flats are finished, the diggers used are allegedly left in the ground because it is cheaper than bringing it back to street level (file picture)

The strategy is often used for major infrastructure projects, such as the Channel Tunnel, during which one boring machine dug itself into the ground to let the others pass.

The strategy could fuel further outrage over the trend for 'iceberg homes', which has led wealthy residents of London's most well-to-do boroughs to complain en masse - even taking their grievances to the High Court.

Construction apparently workers cover the entombed machinery with earth and concrete, leaving it stuck underground instead.

Earlier this week, Ed Smith from the New Statesman magazine said equipment discarded under London was worth around £5million.

He
 wrote: 'First, a crane would have to be hired; second, the entire 
street would need to be closed for a day while the crane was maneuvered into place.

'Both of these stages were very expensive, not to mention unpopular among the distinguished local residents.'

The phenomenon reportedly came to light when conversion specialists contracted to build 'sub-basement' extensions to homes which had already been enlarged found the leftover machinery when they started digging.

Row: Around £5million worth of equipment is thought to have been discarded around London, but builders say the claims are 'complete nonsense'

However, a top London builder has said that the claims are rubbish - and that the economics don't stack up because London floorspace is so valuable.

Don O’Sullivan from London developers Galliard, has said the claims are rubbish and make no commercial sense.

He told the Evening Standard:
 'With the basement space worth up to £8,000 per sq ft why would someone
 leave such valuable space filled with dumped equipment and fill in 
concrete?

'Much more valuable to extract and have as sellable space – oligarchs are rich but not stupid.'

But if the strategy has migrated to private homes in London, it would be yet another sign 
of the heights to which the capital's property market has soared. The 
average London home is now worth £459,000, according to the Office for 
National Statistics.

Developers said the loss of expensive equipment would also be costly to property developers and would risk breaking stringent Health and Safety procedures.

Kevin O’Connor, managing director of Cranbrook Basement added that the suggestion was 'utterly ludicrous' and there are always procedures that can make sure the digger is taken out.

'Hell': Queen guitarist Brian May has complained about works near his home in Kensington

Wealthy homeowners are digging downwards rather than sideways or outwards to fit in saunas, swimming pools, gyms, home cinemas and even workers' quarters.

Actress Joan Collins expressed the outrage of many earlier this year, hitting out at her new neighbours in upmarket Belgravia - many of whom she said hardly even use their homes.

The Dynasty actress, 80, told a residents' maagzine: 'It's really sad. I find it shocking 
that people are digging down to put in swimming pools and bowling alleys
 when they only live here for two or three months of the year.'

Queen guitarist Brian May also took umbrage at building work near his Kensington home. Writing online last month he said: 'Kensington used to be a nice quiet decent place to live... now it’s becoming a hellhole'.

Well-heeled residents have started to hit back - in June of last year Pamela, Countess Listowel, joined 57 other resident in Camden in lodging an official objection to basement plans on her Victorian street.

The 77-year-old peer said: ''These sorts of basements are being built all over Hampstead, but it's a conservation area and it's not in keeping with the street.'

Also in 2013, a group of Hampstead residents including Lord Justice Leveson instructed lawyers to seek an injunction from the High Court to stop their council approving a bid for an underground swimming pool.

Over the last five years, there have been 800 planning applications for basements in Kensington and Chelsea alone.
