Chefs such as Heston Blumenthal have made everyday cooking a high-tech and scientific art. 

But if you struggle to cook even the most simple meal, a range of smart saucepans could set you on the path to culinary success.

Called SmartyPans, the pots feature sensors that sync with a smartphone app and reveal cooking time, weight and if the pan is too hot.

SmartyPans were invented by San Francisco-based Rahul Baxi. Each $189 (£115) pan (pictured) features a weight, humidity and temperature sensor and is powered by a 5V rechargeable battery. When cooking, the pan connects to a free smartphone or tablet app using Bluetooth

And the pans can even help with weight loss, because they reveal the number of servings and calories of every dish.

Each pan features a weight, humidity and temperature sensor and is powered by a 5V rechargeable battery. 

When cooking, the pan connects to a smartphone or tablet app using Bluetooth. 

When in Recipe Mode, as the user adds ingredients to the pan, they are shown a progress bar indicating how much is required.

The app monitors internal temperature and humidity, and tailors the cooking time and instructions accordingly.

This mode additionally reveals how many people the meal will serve, and calories.

Metrics mode gives unfiltered information from the pan,  including temperature and weight.

Its battery recharges in an hour, and lasts up to a month.

Each pan features a weight, humidity and temperature sensor, and is powered by a 5V rechargeable battery.

Made of aluminium and Teflon, the pans are non-stick and the sensors are protected by a waterproof, ceramic cover.

These sensors can also withstand heat of more than 649ºC (1200ºF). 

When cooking, the pan connects to a smartphone or tablet app using Bluetooth, which features two modes.

When in Recipe Mode, as the user adds each ingredient to the pan, they will be shown a progress bar indicating how much more of it is required, and when to stop.

The app then monitors internal temperature and humidity, and tailors the cooking time and instructions accordingly.

This mode additionally reveals how many people the meal will serve, and calories.

Meanwhile, the Metrics mode gives unfiltered information from the pan, in real time, including the current temperature and weight of the ingredients.

Its battery recharges in an hour, and should last up to a month with 'regular use'.

Mr Baxi has set up an Indiegogo campaign, and is hoping to raise $90,000 (£55,000) to fund production of the pans.

The campaign began on 2 September and runs until 17 October.

The pans are expected to retail for $189 (£115) and, if the campaign is successful, will ship internationally in October 2015.

But, Indiegogo contributors can currently order a pan for $169 (£103) and international shipping adds $10 (£6) to the costs.

According to Mr Baxi, once funded, the Android app will be released first, following by an iOS and Windows Phone 8 version.
