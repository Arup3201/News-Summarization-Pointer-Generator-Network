Andrew Rogers claimed he was not given more modelling work because of his sex

A male nude model has won more than £10,000 in damages after pursuing two sexual discrimination cases against his former bosses.

Andrew Rogers, 62, had been life-modelling for art students at Weston college, Weston super Mare, Somerset, for 25 years when he was made redundant in July 2010.

Mr Rogers suffers from the rare blood disorder Raynaud's disease and osteoporosis, but says he was able to continue with his work.

After his redundancy, he and a female former colleague signed up to a modelling agency in an effort to continue working.

However, while the woman was given fresh work by the college within two months, nothing was offered to Mr Rogers.

In October 2010, he took the college to an employment tribunal in Bristol and was awarded £6,230 in compensation. The college was ordered to contribute £2,000 to his costs.

The panel said: 'The college's actions in failing to consider him (Mr Rogers) for life modelling work because of his sex was distressing and has caused him considerable unhappiness.'

Mr Rogers, of Moorland Road, Weston super Mare, Somerset, hoped to return to the college to resume work.

But after signing up to another agency used by the college and discovering the hours were again being given to his former colleague, he claimed sexual discrimination for a second time.

Again the panel found in his favour and he has now been awarded a further £5,000.

The panel agreed that there was 'no obvious explanation' for the college to continue to fail to offer Mr Rogers work

The panel said: 'There is no obvious explanation for continuing to fail to offer Mr Rogers that work.

'Mr Rogers clearly suffered significant distress, anger, humiliation and anxiety as a result of the college's conduct, the more so since the college failed to address the previous finding.

'That increased the hurt.'

Despite the pay-outs, Mr Rogers says he is unhappy that his career has been wrecked by the college's discrimination.

He said: 'When I won the first tribunal, I thought they would have learned their lesson, but no changes were put in place.

'I wanted to go back but they did not offer me any work. It has really and truly affected me.

'I have been offered some other modelling work but turned it down. I think Weston College has destroyed my modelling career. It has caused me a great deal of anxiety.

'I have won two tribunals on sexual discrimination, and I think that is very concerning. There is something very wrong there.'

A Weston College spokesman said: 'The employment tribunal found that there were a number of legitimate reasons that would make it difficult for Mr Rogers to return to the college.'
