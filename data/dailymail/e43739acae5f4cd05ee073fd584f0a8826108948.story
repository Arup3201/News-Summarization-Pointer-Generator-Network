An Episcopal minister at one of New York City's most iconic churches has been arrested after she allegedly swerved through lanes while intoxicated, and was found with an open container of alcohol and hundreds of prescription pills.

Diane Reiners, 53, was taken into custody on March 13 after witnesses alerted police that her orange Toyota struck the Holland Tunnel's curb around 6pm and stopped in the middle of the road.

Reiners was charged with driving while intoxicated, possession of a controlled substance in a motor vehicle, disobeying traffic and reckless driving, police said on Saturday, according to CBS.

The minister from Fort Greene in Brooklyn was traveling from Manhattan to New Jersey through the tunnel when an officer pulled her over for her erratic driving.

Reiners, who is an assisting clergy for the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan, had bloodshot eyes, smelled of vodka and had slurred speech, according to authorities.

St. John the Divine is the fourth largest Christian church in the world and has one of the most iconic in the city of New York. It also remains unfinished - despite construction started in 1892.  

The responding officer found in her car an open bottle of Absolut vodka in the center console, a plastic water bottle filled with vodka, 31 anti-anxiety pill prescribed to someone else and more than 200 pills of potent painkiller, tramadol, according to the New York Post.

The Port Authority cop had her take a field sobriety test which she failed.

Reiners, who lost her husband to tongue cancer, was driving from Manhattan to New Jersey through the tunnel when an officer pulled her over for her erratic driving (above the Holland Tunnel where she reportedly struck a curb and stopped in the middle of the road)

In 2012, Reiners was ordained as an Episcopalian minister, following her husband's death, and she is also an assistant priest at the Morningside Heights cathedral.

She has worked in Emergency Management and Pastoral Care for over a decade, beginning with the 9/11 relief effort in which she coordinated the effort at St. Paul's Chapel, according to her LinkedIn account.

It also said that her work has included responding to more than 25 nationally declared disasters.

Reiners' car was impounded and she was released Friday night with a summons.
