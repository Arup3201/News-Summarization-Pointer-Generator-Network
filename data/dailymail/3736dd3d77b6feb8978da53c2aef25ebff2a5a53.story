Regret: Major Richard Streatfeild, pictured when he was made an MBE, said he misled listeners

A British Army officer whose emotional dispatches from Afghanistan moved millions of radio listeners has hit out at penny-pinching politicians who he says cost the lives of his heroic troops.

Major Richard Streatfeild, whose broadcasts, dubbed The Sangin Diaries, revealed the bravery and sacrifice of soldiers from the Rifles Regiment, says that a woeful lack of equipment led to the deaths of many men.

The 41-year-old former commander, who quit the Army in 2012, now says he believes his broadcasts deceived his audience because he did not highlight the fatal shortages of basic equipment.

‘By sticking to the Ministry of Defence’s line I misled the public,' he admitted last night.

In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, he accused the MOD of ‘criminal negligence’ for sending troops into battle without adequate protection. He also revealed how:

Streatfeild’s claims are more damning because his 140 troops from A Company, 4th Battalion, the Rifles, were sent to the most dangerous area of Helmand Province – Sangin – where more UK soldiers had died than anywhere else.

The lack of armoured vehicles meant Streatfeild’s soldiers had to cross treacherous terrain on foot. Inevitably they fell victim to enemy snipers and to improvised explosive devices (IEDs) dug into paths and roads.

Five members of A Company were killed, 35 wounded.

Yet while these shortages drove Streatfeild to despair, he took to the airwaves of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme to give a reassuring but misleading account of the provision of equipment.

In a broadcast on Today in March 2010, Streatfeild addressed concerns about troops not having adequate equipment.

He told BBC listeners: ‘I have an excellent rifle with a brand new sight, a new helmet, winter and summer kit that does the job and more.’

Last night, a contrite Streatfeild said: ‘It is the equipment broadcast that really sticks in my gullet. I avoided all the contentious life or death issues which I knew about at the time.

'Reading the transcript now I feel a real sense of shame. By sticking to the MOD’s line I misled the public about the equipment crisis gripping the soldiers in Afghanistan at the time.

‘I regret giving the impression that everything was essentially OK, a sanitised version of the ground truth.

Claims: Major Streatfeild said there were not enough armoured vehicles, which the MoD denied

'The lack of radios, armoured vehicles and bomb detection devices, which should have been made available for training purposes, cost soldiers’ lives, as did a shortage of transport helicopters.

'In at least ten examples of my troops being wounded or killed I regard the MOD as being criminally negligent.

‘For example from October to December 2009 my soldiers had no armoured or mine-resistant vehicles to use in Sangin, the most dangerous place in the world.

'We only had half the Bowman radios we required and most soldiers only had personal radios, which worked over a range of 1,300ft.'

Streatfeild’s concerns about kit first surfaced in pre-deployment training, when soldiers are supposed to practice using the life-saving equipment they will rely on in the warzone.

‘From October to December
 2009 my soldiers had no armoured or mine-resistant vehicles to use in 
Sangin, the most dangerous place in the world. We
 only had half the Bowman radios we required and most soldiers only had 
personal radios, which worked over a range of 1,300ft.'

His troops required 35 mine detectors to meet the warzone ratio of one detector for every four soldiers, but got just three.

This shortage led troops to simulate carrying a detector by waving broomsticks, wafting their arms about and making beeping noises.

In another incident, the accidental shooting of Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard by another British soldier showed the danger of not having enough radios. Colleagues mistook LCpl Pritchard for an insurgent and, without a proper radio, a warning message could not be sent.

Last night, Streatfeild described how he seethed as he listened to the evidence at Pritchard’s inquest given by a colonel who was the MOD’s expert witness on target identification.

Colonel Stephen Cartwright told the coroner that following the tragedy in December 2009 the Army had upgraded an infrared identification system carried by soldiers and was looking at introducing better, more reliable radios.

Streatfeild said: ‘I was fuming. I knew that upgrade had not taken place. Colonel Cartwright’s evidence misled the coroner and LCpl Pritchard’s family.’

One in four users of the Vallon bomb detector in Sangin died, including Rifleman Martin Kinggett (pictured)

‘I have looked up the chain of command for anyone who might be big enough to accept this [responsibility for Pritchard’s death]. I don’t any more.

‘The generals, civil servants  and politicians seem to have no desire to accept the consequences of their actions or inactions.’

Last night, an MOD spokeswoman said: ‘We strongly dispute these claims and can confirm the comments made by Colonel Cartwright at the inquest.

‘At that time we had upgraded infra-red identification equipment and were in the process of procuring further new equipment to help ensure a similar incident could not happen again.’

Streatfeild has written a book attacking the MOD over equipment failures and tactics used against the Taliban. ‘Honourable Warriors’ will be serialised in The Mail on Sunday.

Killed: Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard was 22

Streatfeild says: ‘On the night of Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard’s death, the section commander’s radio stopped working and none of the soldiers on Pritchard’s patrol had a back-up radio capable of sending a message to the British sniper before he fired the fatal shot which killed Pritch.

'He thought he was shooting at Taliban fighters who appeared to preparing a roadside explosive device 2,500ft away. 

‘Actually he was shooting at his own men – Pritch and another soldier who survived the incident.’ 

At an inquest, a coroner blamed military ‘failures’  for Pritchard’s death.

‘To use a bomb detector effectively when you’re under enemy fire takes hundreds of hours of practice,’ Streatfeild says.

Due to kit shortages only three devices, known as Vallons, were available to his 140 men to train on before they deployed to Afghanistan.

He adds: ‘So my soldiers had less time to use the equipment. Waving a stick was no substitute for practising with a bomb detector.’ 

In Sangin, one in four Vallon operators, including rifleman Martin Kinggett, were killed or seriously injured.

‘I sent 25 soldiers on driving courses so they could use the Mastiff, an armoured vehicle which provides protection against mines,’ says Streatfeild.

‘When we got to Sangin there was not one armoured or mine-proof vehicle in our base.

We were furious and felt bitterly let down, having been told that we would be able to use Mastiffs. This was a disgrace – these vehicles would have saved lives. So for months we walked everywhere and were very vulnerable.’

Hundreds of soldiers were sent to the most dangerous area of Helmand Province without a single armoured or mine-resistant vehicle, and with half the quantity of radios they required.

Troops who would have to search for deadly Taliban mines using metal detectors had to train using broomsticks, leaving them woefully ill-prepared when on the frontline. One in four soldiers using the detectors were killed or suffered terrible injuries.

He fumed with anger as he watched a Whitehall mandarin tell an inquest into the death of one of his soldiers that kit problems had been solved.

A quota system for gallantry medals meant top brass who were miles from the frontline won awards, while junior soldiers involved in fierce fighting against the Taliban lost out.
