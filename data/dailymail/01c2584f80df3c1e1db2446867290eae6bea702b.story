A heroic soldier who survived being blown up by the Taliban twice to be awarded Britain's second-highest medal for bravery has offered it for sale at £100,000.

Colour Sergeant Alan Dennis was presented with the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross - second only to the Victoria Cross - by Prince Charles for risking his life to rescue three comrades while under fire. 

As he dragged the third colleague to safety a rocket propelled grenade exploded 5ft in front of him, sending him flying through the air and into a ditch, breaking his arm.

Soldier: Sgt Dennis, pictured in Afghanistan, was on patrol in Helmand Province in 2009 when he and his fellow soldiers were ambushed by the Taliban 

But the brave soldier continued firing his rifle with his good arm until help arrived.

At the time of the ambush in 2009, Sgt Dennis had only just recovered from being blown up in a vehicle by a roadside bomb.

He suffered a broken leg after he was catapulted 30ft in the 2007 blast which killed the British serviceman sat next to him, Drummer Thomas Wright.

Now aged 40 and a married father-of-two, Sgt Dennis, from Derbyshire, has left the army and has decided to sell his CGC, along with the rest of his medals, for the 'life changing' amount of money.

He said: 'I am obviously reluctant in many ways to sell my medals.

'However, the amount of money that this sale could realise is potentially life changing for myself and my family.

'As a husband and father, I have to put their welfare first and this has made the decision to auction the medals easier than it might otherwise have been.'

The medal is being sold in a group along with his other military awards, including his Accumulated Campaign Service Medal, which he received in 2011, two Jubilee medals and one he was awarded for his service in Northern Ireland. 

Out of 58 ever awarded, Sgt Dennis' CGC is only the third to come up for auction. 

Sgt Dennis, who spent 20 years in the Army, served with the 2nd Battalion of the Mercian Regiment and was second in command of a patrol involving soldiers from the Afghan National Army when they were ambushed by the Taliban in a river valley in Helmand Province in 2009.

Half the men broke into a nearby compound to establish a fire support position but upon doing so realised that several of the Afghan troops were still out in the open

Tough decision: Married father-of-two Sgt Dennis, has now left the army and has decided to sell his CGC for the 'life changing' amount of money

Sgt Dennis dashed out twice to help two men to safety.

It has taken five years for Sgt Dennis to recover from the physical and psychological scars he suffered in the ambush attack.

He left the army in September this year and has started a new job elsewhere.

The citation for his CGC states: 'On the third run, he heard a 'whoosh' and turned as a rocket propelled grenade exploded three metres in front of him.

'Although the fragmentation missed him, Dennis was hurled through the air by the blast and into a ditch. For a few seconds he was unconscious and when he came to his left arm hung uselessly by his side and he was in intense pain.

'Undeterred, Dennis fought on, moving back to the fire support position where he used a radio to send a contact report.'

He refused morphine as he said it would have dulled his senses or created a burden for his team and instead carried on using his rifle with his right arm.

The citation continues: 'Dennis' fighting spirit when severely wounded was outstanding and inspired others. His example and initiative brought the ANA into the battle which saved the patrol from defeat.'

Before being presented with his CGC at Buckingham Palace in 2010, Prince Charles - the Colonel-in-Chief to the Mercian Regiment - wrote personally to Sgt Dennis.

He wrote: 'To say that I am full of admiration for your gallantry, courage and initiative is an understatement. You are an immense credit to this country of ours which is, without doubt, more fortunate than it realises in having such dedicated people as yourself serving in our armed forces.'

The letter from Prince Charles is also being sold alongside Sgt Denni's medals as is an unopened bottle of Highgrove Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky presented to him by the Royal. 

Pierce Noonan, of London-auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, said: 'The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross is second only to the Victoria Cross among British combat gallantry awards.

'Just 58 have been awarded to our Armed Forces since the CGC was instituted in 1993 - a period during which our servicemen and women have been almost constantly involved in a series of major conflicts.

'That tells us how special the award is and how astonishingly brave and tenacious Colour Sergeant Dennis was when he won it.' 

One of the first ever CGCs, awarded to former Royal Marine Justin Thomas, from Llantwit Fadre, sold for £88,000 in September 2009. Marine Thomas, who received the medal after he single-handedly fought off more than 100 Iraqi insurgents in 2003, said he would use the money to buy a house.

Another, awarded for an action in Afghanistan sold for £95,000 in 2012. 

The sale takes place in London on December 10. 

Recipient: Dipprasad Pun of the Royal Gurkha Rifles  was awarded the honour after he single-handedly defeated up to 30 Taliban insurgents

The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC) is the second highest military medal that can be awarded to members of the United Kingdom's armed forces.

Presented in 'recognition of an act or acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations against the enemy', the medal was introduced in 1993 and is second only to the Victoria Cross.

It was introduced after a review of the honours system as part of a drive to remove distinctions of rank in awards for bravery, replacing both the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal, and can also be awarded posthumously. 

All ranks of the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force can be awarded the CGC, with further medal-worthy acts of gallantry honoured with a bar which can be added to the medal.

The CGC is silver and in the shape of a cross, with a laurel wreath underneath and is mounted on a white ribbon with blue and crimson stripes. A recipient's rank, name and unit are engraved on the reverse. 

Corporal Wayne Mills was the first gazetted recipient of the CGC. While serving with the 1st Battalion The Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) on UN Service in Bosnia in 1994, his patrol came under  fire, from a group of Bosnian Serbs. The patrol returned fire, killing two of the attackers but became vulnerable to futher attack when they reached an open clearing. Corporal Mills then  turned back into the wood and engaged the attacking group, delaying them long enough to allow the rest of his patrol to cross the clearing. Corporal Mills shot the leader of the group, causing the rest to scatter and returned to his patrol safely.

Other  recipients include Dipprasad Pun, a Nepalese corporal with the Royal Gurkha Rifles who was awarded the honour after he single-handedly defeated up to 30 Taliban insurgents who were storming his control post near Babaji in Helmand province in 2010.

Three-time Boat Race winner and Army Captain Robin Bourne-Taylor was awarded the medal in 2010,while Royal Marine Mark Jackson ensured his receipt of the award was an extra special day by proposing to his girlfriend Rebecca Daniel after picking up his award from Prince Charles in 2011.

Jackson received the award for picking up and throwing back an insurgent's grenade and lying on a comrade to shield him from the blast, while serving in Afghanistan.
