Russian model  Marina Sashina, 26, revealed her flag was defiled with yellow paint during a rehearsal for the World Bikini Model International  Final in Beijing

A 'dirty tricks' allegation has emerged at an international bikini pageant after the Russian contestant claimed she was victimised because of her loyalty to Vladimir Putin's policies over Ukraine.

Model and TV presenter Marina Sashina, 26, revealed that her tricolour Russian flag was defiled with yellow paint during a rehearsal in Beijing.

She is one of 48 contestants from 46 countries in China for the World Bikini Model International 2014 Final.

'Marina left the flag in dressing room for literally a couple of minutes, and then came back and found the Russian tricolour smeared with paint,' said her spokeswoman Valentina Gurova.

'It is noteworthy that in the flags of the USA, Germany and Ukraine were nearby, but they remained intact.'

Sushina stormed: 'To my great regret, the policy of double standards of the West has reached the beauty industry.

'I was moved to tears. It was painful to see the Russian flag desecrated.'

Evidently blaming a Western contestant for carrying out the act, though not naming the suspected culprit, she said such actions were inappropriate at a beauty event far from Ukraine.

In a show of goodwill she posed with the Ukrainian contestant at the pageant but stressed: 'I am sure it was a provocation by the other contestants - the representatives of countries that do not support the policy of Russia.

'The reason for this could be my interview at a press conference, in which I clearly outlined my views on the current political situation in the world,' she explained.

'I believe that the biased assessment of the situation in Ukraine, and the policy of double standards, led to a quarrel between two friendly nations - Russia and Ukraine.'

Sashina lives in Moscow but is from Rostov on Don, capital of a region where Russian troops have massed close to the border with Ukraine, causing alarm in Kiev and the West.

She has made little secret of her positive view on Putin's polices and appears to be a poster girl for the Kremlin president.

'Sadly our country now is in state conflict with the US - a 'cold' conflict,' she said.

She does not think it will become a full-blown war 'because our president Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and the American president are full of common sense. They understand what the war is - only death and tragedy.

'God grant, the current situation will also end soon, the conflict which occurred because America misunderstood Russia's correct policy towards Ukraine.

'But I am sure that if there are serious attacks on our country, Russia can answer.

'We have all the weapons to protect our homeland, our borders, our people.'

She claimed that Western sanctions against Russia would only make her motherland stronger.

'The answer the question of who will suffer more in this confrontation, we can see very soon,' she said.

'In the meantime, I look forward with hope and envision Russian prosperity and welfare.

'We have a huge country - one sixth of the planet's land with virtually inexhaustible natural resources - oil, gas, timber.

'As for agriculture, I think now is the best time to restore it to the level at which it was in its heyday in the Soviet Union.

'So that all the sanctions adopted by the West, we only benefit - they will allow our country to realise its inner potential, and our people. Unite!'

This year's World Bikini Model International is themed 'Charming China and Oriental Fashion'.

The Chinese media has shown the contestants posing in bikinis at the Great Wall of China and more modestly dressed at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.

She does not believe that the current situation will escalate into a full-blown war 'because president Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin (pictured) and the American president are full of common sense'
