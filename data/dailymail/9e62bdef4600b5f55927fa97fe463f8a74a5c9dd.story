Whoops! Many festive food items will be well past their 'use-by' date come December 25

Supermarket shelves are already groaning under the weight of tasty treats fit for the lunch table on Christmas Day.

But shoppers keen to stock up early should pay careful attention – many of the food items will be well past their ‘use-by’ date come December 25. 

Despite being contained in brightly coloured and eye-catching festive packaging, some products even had to be consumed by November.

On sale at Morrisons on Friday was a tempting array of Christmas Poached Salmon and Beetroot Appetisers – a pack of 12 costs £3.29. But the morsels had to be eaten by last night.

On the same day, the chain’s Christmas Three Cheese Selection was certainly ripe  for opening – its ‘use-by’ date  is tomorrow.

At rival Tesco, the Christmas Le Roule With Chilli, in cheerful festive packaging, will also be past its ‘best-after’ date tomorrow.

And at Asda, a prawn cocktail – in festive pack with a red banner decorated with a gold star and described as Succulent Prawns In A Creamy Marie Rose Sauce With A Splash Of Lemon Juice – should be used by Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, The Mail on Sunday also discovered that Tesco’s Christmas Blue Stilton has a ‘use-by’ date of December 12.

Although it is possible to freeze some items, most are intended to be eaten fresh.

Morrisons’ spokesman Julian Bailey said: ‘Our customers are eating many of our festive products in November and early December. I am eating our Christmas Stollen bread, which has a short shelf life.

‘People like to get into the spirit well before December 25.’

A Tesco spokesman said: ‘Many of our customers have Christmas  parties and events before the big day itself, so we offer them a range of Christmas products.’

Asda said: ‘Some of the lines are in store all-year-round – and in the run-up to Christmas we will change the packaging to give customers inspiration.’
