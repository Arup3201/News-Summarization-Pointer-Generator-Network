It is the perfect destination for Buzz Lightyear and Woody fans.

Disney has unveiled plans to build a Toy Story themed hotel  - but you'll have to travel to over 5,500 miles across the globe to stay there.

Few details have released about the top secret project, but  the Disney Insider blog revealed some official concept art, which gives an insight into what fans should expect.

One image shows that the building exterior will feature the clouds found on the wallpaper in Andy's room; while a centre courtyard will display a statue of the ball featured in the movies.

In an official statement, Disney said: 'The Resort's Toy Story Hotel will transport guests to a world inspired by the toys from the Disney/Pixar series of Toy Story animated films.'

The new Shanghai resort is due to open in December 2015, and Disney also released a birds-eye view over the two themed hotels, as well as what's planned for an area called Disneytown – a shopping, dining and entertainment district.

An area called the Market Place will be brimming with specialty shops selling Disney merchandise, musicians and entertainers.

Next to the Marketplace, Spice Alley, will serve up  a variety of popular Asian cuisines, and on the Broadway Boulevard, visitors can discover an array of popular upscale labels.

There will be a central lake, walking paths and gardens near Disneytown, giving guests the opportunity to relax,  surrounded by nature, or admire the sunset.

And visitors can stay onsite at the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel, an Art Nouveau-style hotel.

Tom Staggs, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, said: 'We are excited to provide guests with a glimpse of the unique hotels and the vibrant retail, dining and entertainment district we are creating as a part of the new Shanghai Disney Resort.'

'These elements, like the entire park and resort area, are designed to deliver the quality, guest service and great storytelling of Disney, and created specifically with our Chinese guests in mind.'
