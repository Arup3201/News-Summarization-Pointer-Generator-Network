A baby girl has been born by the side of a busy South Florida highway as her parents made their way to a birthing center.

The newborn's father delivered her in the backseat of their car on the side of the Interstate 595 in Hollywood about 6.30pm yesterday.

The calm mother, who has not been identified, was holding her little bundle of joy when paramedics arrived. 

'She walked (her husband) through it because she’s a NICU nurse,' paramedic David Porter told CBS Miami. 'He caught the baby.'
