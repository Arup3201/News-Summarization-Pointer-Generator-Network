A 7-year-old boy from North Caronia has died after his 11-year-old brother accidentally shot him in the neck with an arrow.

The incident happened March 15 at the family's home in Wake County. Daniel Velazquez succumbed to his injuries four days later.

According to sheriff’s deputies, the 7-year-old was struck in the throat with an arrow shot from a bow by his big brother, Israel.

Daniel was rushed to WakeMed in critical condition, but despite doctors’ efforts he could not be saved.

The brothers' uncle Javier Velazquez told ABC11 last week the boys’ parents were home at the time of the accident, which took place at around 12.45pm March 15.

According to Velazquez, Daniel and Israel found a bow and arrow and were playing with it in the woods near their mobile home on Swift Creek Lane when tragedy struck. 

The siblings' mother, Erica Velazquez, made a frantic 911 call after learning of what happened, telling the dispatcher that her 7-year-old son 'was shot in the throat.'

‘His body is swelling up,’ she was quoted by the station WRAL as saying on the call. ‘He's swelling up right now, really bad.’

Daniel, a second-grader at Ballentine Elementary School, spent four days in the pediatric ICU at WakeMed, but his injures proved too grave.

Daniel and israel's aunt has launched a GoFundMe campaign to help cover the boy's final expenses.

In the description of the fundraiser, Mimi Vasquez described her late nephew as a smart and happy boy who loved playing outside and enjoyed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

Daniel is set to be laid to rest Thursday following a funeral service at St. Bernadette’s Catholic Church in Fuquay-Varina.
