Upset: Tia Sharp's mother Natalie Sharp said on Daybreak today that her relationship with her mother has never been stronger despite their relationships with Stuart Hazell

Tia Sharp's mother today said her relationship with her mother, 
the schoolgirl's grandmother, 'had never been stronger' despite their 
tangled love life with killer Stuart Hazell.

Natalie Sharp, 31, also denied she was to blame for her daughter's murder after allowing the 37-year-old convicted drug dealer to babysit her, saying 
criticism of her parenting was 'water off a duck's back'.

Ms Sharp had a fling with Hazell for around two weeks in 2003 
after meeting him in a South London pub her mother Christine Bicknell, 
47, worked in at the time.

Four years later Ms Bicknell began a relationship with 
Hazell, knowing that he had been convicted of serious offences and had served time in prison.

It was these relationships that allowed the child porn obsessed window cleaner to gain access to the schoolgirl and eventually kill her at home in August last year.

Today, Natalie Sharp said she and her mother are still close and the murder 'has made us stronger. Not that we could have got any stronger.'

Natalie also said her mother Christine Bicknell, who was Hazell’s partner, was also struggling to come come to terms with what happened.

She said: 'We speak about it all the time. She’s in the same place as I am, just trying to get our heads round it. Because when you grow up, you believe the monster, the bad man, is in an alleyway, the bad man is the scary man, but in this it was the bad man’s got a smile.'

Ms Sharp said she had trusted Hazell '100 per cent' with her children and that she had not known of his violent streak.

'He was like two different people,' she told Daybreak. 'The person I 
thought we knew was soft and gentle and friendly, there wasn't an inch 
of bad bone in him.'

In a statement read to Hazell’s Old 
Bailey trial she vehemently defended her decision to allow Tia to spend 
the night alone with him on the night he killed her, insisting he was 
not somebody she ‘dragged in from the street.’

Natalie Sharp told ITV's Daybreak this morning she would have one question for Hazell if she visited him: 'Just - "why?". But then, is he going to answer the questions? Then I want to put my hands around his throat.'

Ms Sharp said justice 'will never be done' for Tia and that she wants Hazell to be 'beaten, brought back and beaten again'.

Hazell had moved into Christine Bicknell's her home in New Addington,
Croydon, a week after they started going out in 2007. A life of crime
continued despite settling down.

His criminal past included convictions for racially aggravated 
common assault in 2002, dealing cocaine in 2003 and possession of a 
machete in a public place in 2010, for which he was jailed for 12 
months.

Deception: Last August Christine Bicknell went out on the search for Tia with Hazell, wearing t-shirts with her face on it (pictured together at a candlelit vigil), not knowing he was the killer of her granddaughter

‘I knew
Stuart had been in prison before, but I took him as I found him,' Ms Bicknell had said.

‘He seemed like the perfect guy. He was affectionate, great with the 
kids, good around the house with the  housework. He wasn’t good in the 
bedroom. He never seemed interested in sex.’

In the weeks before the murder, he repeatedly photographed and filmed Tia as she slept and videoed her as she rubbed cream on her legs in her underwear.

Police also found searches including the terms ‘naked little girlies’, ‘illegal under-age incest pics’ and ‘schoolgirl abuse’ on the web browser of his mobile phone.

The 37-year-old smothered Tia in the early hours of August 3 last year after being left alone to babysit her while Miss Bicknell worked overnight at a care home.

He photographed the schoolgirl’s naked body before wrapping it in sheets and bin liners and hiding it in the loft, where it was found a week later during the fourth police search of the house.

Ms Sharp said today: 'If we were a posh family I'm sure they'd have found her quicker'.

Mr Justice Nicol told Hazell as he jailed him for 38 years yesterday: ‘All that lay ahead of her – a career, loves and family of her own – will now never be'.

Ms Bicknell had stood beside her 
boyfriend – both of them wearing ‘Find Tia’ T-shirts – as police 
searched for her granddaughter.

Even after Stuart Hazell was arrested for killing the 12-year-old, 
Christine Bicknell said she loved him and she described Tia as ‘mouthy’ 
adding that ‘you couldn’t force her to do anything’.

She had also clung to Stuart Hazell as police searched for the 
12-year-old not knowing the convicted drug dealer had murdered her and 
hidden the body in the attic.

‘I let my baby down and I will never be able to get over that. I spent 
five nights in that house being cuddled and comforted by the man I 
loved, praying for Tia to come home safely,' she told the Daily Mirror.

‘Her mum, Natalie, even came round and stayed with us because we were
holding each other together. But all the time Tia’s body was above our 
heads, all alone wrapped in bin bags and Stuart had killed her.

‘But I didn’t know, why the hell didn’t I know she was there? I’m her
grandmother, I should have protected her but I failed her.'

‘I swear, there were no clues that I was living with a monster. And 
if people want to make comparisons they should look at Stuart ... 
another Ian Huntley.’

Natalie Sharp had 
also taken refuge at her mother's home while Tia was missing and slept in a 
top floor room below where her daughter was being kept in the attic.

'I'm still sick now when I think about it. I slept right underneath her all that time,' she told The Sun.

Heartbroken that her granddaughter Tia Sharp had disappeared, Christine Bicknell looked for care and support from the man she had 'loved with all my heart'.

Ms Bicknell, 47, said she had no reason to suspect that Hazell was involved in the schoolgirl’s disappearance.

‘When Tia went missing it didn’t cross my mind that she could be dead,’ she said.

‘I always thought she was coming home. It didn’t cross my mind that he would hurt her. He loved Tia, she idolised him.

‘I love Stuart with all my heart, he 
was my world, but my grandchildren always came first.’ ‘I had no worries
about Stuart around her or her around Stuart.’
