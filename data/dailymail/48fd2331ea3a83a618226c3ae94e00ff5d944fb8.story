New Year's Eve suicide: Aronno Haque went missing on December 30 and his body was found two days later in the Central Park Lake

New York Police pulled the body of a 22-year-old Indiana college student out of the Central Park Lake on New Year's Day two days after the Bagladeshi native went missing.

Aronno Haque, of Dhaka, Bangladesh, was spending the break from school with relatives in Jamaica, Queens when he disappeared on December 30.

He was last seen around 1:30pm that day when he went to meet friends near Union Square in New York.

When he left, he told them he had to mail a bunch of letters and that they needed to be in writing since the message was very personal.

The next day, police found his wallet, passport, phone and 'various papers' near the lake prompting a diving search of the waters on New Years Eve.

But it wasn't until the afternoon on January 1 that divers were able to locate his body.

Detectives told his uncle he 'walked straight [into the water].'

They found a note among his belongings with his family's phone number, telling officers to call them so they could look after his body.

Haque's uncle Raoshan Chowdhury, 58, had no idea his nephew was having problems. The night before he disappeared, Haque talked to him about applying for a green card and looking for a job in the U.S. after graduation.

Letters: Haque was last seen on December 30 around 1:30pm while visiting friends in Union Square. He told them he had to mail letters to family and that the message was sensitive and couldn't be sent in an email

Remains: Police found Haque's wallet and other belongings near the Central Park boathouse on New Year's Eve prompting a diving search for his body

'He was kind of shy, very reserved, but also fun-loving,' Mr Chowdhury told DNAinfo. 'He loved to socialize with friends, he loved going to the movies, trying different dishes.'

Haque came to the U.S. four years ago to attend Wabash University, an all-male liberal arts school in Indiana where he studied economics. 

On Thursday, the university's President Gregory Hess issued a statement of remorse.

'All of us at Wabash are deeply saddened by the news of Aronno's passing. He was a very kind and generous person, and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.'

Out of the blue: Haque was staying with his uncle in Jamaica, Queens for the break from school. His uncle says he had no idea the 22-year-old was having problems

Loved: Friends and family remembered the lost college student in posts on Facebook and Reddit

Friends and family have been sharing their memories of the young student on Facebook and Reddit.

Rudolph Alan says he lived two doors down from Haque in a dorm at Wabash this semester and that they ran into each other often.

'It saddens me to think he may have been in much pain,' Mr Alan wrote, 'but I hope and pray he can be at peace and pray that his family may be given strength during this trying time. May we never forget Aronno Haque.'

Haque body is being transported back to Bangladesh for burial.
