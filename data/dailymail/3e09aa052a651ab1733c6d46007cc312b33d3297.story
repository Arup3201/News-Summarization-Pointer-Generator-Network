The Rebels bikie gang represents 'one of Australia's highest risk criminal threats' and its exiled president 'continues to to exert significant influence' over the group, according to court documents obtained by Daily Mail Australia.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison would not explain why he cancelled Rebels president Alex Vella's visa while the 61-year-old was holidaying in his native Malta five months ago, saying only the decision was made under 'character provisions'.

Daily Mail Australia can now reveal the minister's decision relied on detailed intelligence provided by an Australian Crime Commission-led task force and outlined in a document tendered in the Federal Court last month.

The Attero task force was established in 2012 to 'disrupt, disable and dismantle criminal activities of the Rebels MC - one of Australia's highest risk criminal threats', the document states.

Rebels president Alex Vella, second from left, has taken his fight against the Australian government's cancellation of his visa to the Federal Court, denying his the head of a criminal organisation

Attero investigators allege under Vella's leadership the Rebels have engaged in drug dealing, money laundering, serious assaults, kidnapping, extortion, firearms offences, threatening law enforcement officers and intimidating court witnesses. It is believed the gang has more than 2000 members across the country.

'The Rebels MC membership in Australia includes a significant number of individuals with criminal convictions,' the court document states. 

'Between January 20012 and June 2013, 718 Rebels MC members, nominees and associates were either reported or arrested in relation to 1211 charges for offences ranging from violence related offences (including serious assault, stalking, kidnapping and affray), firearms and weapons offences, drugs offences, and property, street and traffic offences.

'Rebels MC members have used violence in a premeditated manner to discipline Rebels MC members who have been perceived to have breached Rebels MC rules, in disputes with other OMCGs, threaten law enforcement officers, intimidate court witnesses and extort businesses and individuals.'

Vella denies running a criminal organisation and has challenged the Department of Immigration's decision in the Federal Court. The document detailing the Rebels' alleged criminal activity under Vella was annexed to an affidavit sworn on October 9 by Martin Bowles, secretary of the Department of Immigration.

To help fund his legal battle, Vella - who is regularly described as a millionaire businessman - is selling $50 T-shirts on his website alexvella.com.au. The T-shirts feature a picture of him under the slogan 'BRING HIM HOME' on the front and a quote from Nelson Mandela on the back: 'To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity' 

He is also offering a stubby holder, car sticker and key ring package for $25. 'Show your Support!' the website states. 'Help Alex funding his legal fees by purchasing some of these cool items. (Of course you can also just make a donation without purchasing any items.)'

'Bring Him Home': Supporters of Alex Vella are being asked to help fund the Rebels president's legal fight against the cancellation of his visa.

'To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity'. Alex Vella quotes Nelson Mandela in his bid to be allowed to return to Australia.

Catering to all budgets: Supporters of Alex Vella's fight to come home can buy a stubby holder, car sticker and key ring for $25 or just make a donation of any size.

The Let Alex Vella Return to Australia Facebook page has received more than 21,000 likes. Wayne West wrote on Wednesday: 'I'd rather have a Rebels clubhouse in my street than a mosque...'

Scotty Burke wrote the same day: 'U know what sh... me about this country, they cancel Alex's visa yet they have known terrorists flying in and out of Australia fighting for ISIS and other known terror groups. Let him come home ffs!!!'

Vella arrived in Australia in 1963. He has regularly returned to Malta and was crowned light heaveyweight boxing champion of his homeland in 1978. He has never taken out Australian citizenship.

True patriot: Rebels bikie boss Alex Vella says he is not a criminal and just wants to return to Australia so he can rejoin his family, run his motorcycle club and continue his charitable good works.

Sometimes referred to as 'the Maltese Falcon', he has four sons, says he donates generously to charities and is a regular churchgoer. He describes the Rebels as 'family' and a 'brotherhood', not a criminal organisation.

'I have always worked hard and given back to community,' he states on his website. 'I have always voted and paid tax. All I want is to be able to return to my home of 46 years and be reunited with my family.'

The Attero task force sees him differently, according to court documents.

'The Rebels MC presents a high threat to the Australian community,' the court documents says. 'This OMCG has demonstrated an ability to increase its geographical influence, diversify across illicit drug markets and launder illicit profits.

'Alessio Emanuel Vella has been the National President of the Rebels MC since 1973. During this 40 years he has overseen the expansion of the OMCG from three original chapters to the largest OMCG in Australia. He has and continues to exert significant influence over the Rebels MC in Australia.

'Mr Vella acknowledges he is the National President of the Rebels MC. He also acknowledges he is aware that several members of the Rebels MC have been involved in criminal activities.

'The fact that Rebels MC members remain members despite criminal convictions including convictions obtained whilst members of the OMCG contradicts Mr Vella's assertions the Rebels MC does not condone criminal activity by its members, and allow them to remain members.

'The Rebels MC have remained cohesive and disciplined through Mr Vella's strong leadership.'

The Rebels has expanded from Australia to include international chapters in 20 other countries: Cambodia, Canada, Costa Rica, Croatia, England, Fiji, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Laos, Lebanon, Malta, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Thailand and the USA. 

The Attero task force comprises all state and territory police forces as well as the Australian Crime Commission, Australian Federal Police, Customs and Border Protection Service, Australian Tax Office, Australian Securities and Investments Commission and Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre.
