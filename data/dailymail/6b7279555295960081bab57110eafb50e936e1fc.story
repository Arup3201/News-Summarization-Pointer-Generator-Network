Mourners clapped and cheered during Rik Mayall's funeral today after his friend and long-term collaborator Adrian Edmondson looked close to tears as he helped carry his rose-covered wicker coffin.

The Young Ones, Bottom and Blackadder star died suddenly at the age of 56 after a heart attack last week.

Comedy stars Nigel Planer, Ruby Wax, Jennifer Saunders, Alan Rickman, Ben Elton, Alexei Sayle and Dawn French were among mourners who attended the service at St George's Church in Dittisham, Devon.

They joined Mr Mayall's wife Barbara and children, Rosie, 28, Sidney, 26, and Bonnie, 18, who previously described him as a â€˜wonderful, generous, foul-mouthed' husband and father.

Around 140 loved-ones attended, mainly dressed sombrely in black, to celebrate the career of the star, who died on Monday June 9 at his home in Barnes, south west London.

But during the service, led by Father Will Hazlewood, the mourners were heard to cheering and clapping inside the church and guests filed out to the Van Morrison hit Brown Eyed Girl.

Prior to the service, Mayall's widow Barbara asked fans for their 'thoughts and prayers' during the private ceremony.

'We
 would like to let you, the fans, know that we will be having a private 
family funeral for Rik, as I am sure you will understand,' Ms Robbins 
said in a statement

'We will be burying him at 2pm on Thursday June 19 if you would like to join us in thoughts and prayer at this time.

'Thank you again for all your love and support to all our family, it brings great strength.'

Born to 
drama teacher parents in Harlow, Essex, Rik Mayall began his career in 
show business as one half of a duo with long-time collaborator and 
university friend Adrian Edmondson.

'There were times when Rik and I were writing together when we almost died laughing,' Edmondson, 57, said.

'They
 were some of the most carefree stupid days I ever had, and I feel 
privileged to have shared them with him. And now he's died for real. 
Without me. Selfish b******.'

Considered one of Britain's comedy greats, he played
 a number of celebrated brash, crude and vulgar characters in sitcoms 
including The Young Ones, Blackadder, The New Statesman and Bottom. Mr Mayall also featured on the big screen in films Drop Dead Fred and Guest House Paradiso.

A memorial service for the star is expected to be held in September.

He collapsed and died following what was described as an 'acute cardiac event'.
