George Osborne today called on the Labour party to pay £1.5million in tax allegedly avoided on a donation.

The Chancellor entered the row over shares given to Labour by businessman John Mill, who claimed it was a ‘tax efficient’ arrangement agreed with senior Labour Party officials.

Labour leader Ed Miliband also faced questions about the affair, insisting the party would pay tax on any dividends it received.

Demand: Chancellor George Osborne called on Labour to pay the tax owed after John Mills revealed his £1.65million donation to Labour in January this year was made in the form of shares in his shopping channel company

Mr Mills revealed his £1.65million donation to Labour in January this year was made in the form of shares in his shopping channel company JML.

He said the ‘tax efficient’ arrangement was agreed with senior Labour Party officials.

Tax experts said he would have had to pay almost £1.5million in tax if he had made the donation in cash.

They suggested Mr Mills would have had to earn £3.1million before tax to afford to make his donation in cash, with £1.46million going to HM Revenue & Customs.

Alternatively, if he had made the donation via a single cash dividend it would have attracted dividend tax at 30.5 per cent, leaving a bill of almost £725,000.

The revelation is deeply embarrassing for Ed Miliband who has attacked the Government over its failure to take robust action to tackle tax avoidance by wealthy individuals and corporations.

In a letter to Mr Miliband this morning, Tory Mr Osborne challenged him: 'Can you confirm that the Labour Party advised Mr Mills on how to avoid tax on his donation?

'Most importantly, will you now pass the amount of tax that has been avoided to the Exchequer?'

The Chancellor said the actions appeared to be 'directly at odds' with Mr Miliband's public statements, adding that the money was 'needed to fund vital public services such as the health service and our schools'.

However, Mr Miliband insisted Labour would pay tax every year on dividends from the shares.

Speaking in Newham, he said: 'My understanding of this is the reason John Mills gave us the money in this way is that he wanted us to have a steady stream of income.

'The Labour Party itself will be paying tax on these dividends. We are not avoiding tax. We are paying tax.'

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said the donation deal demonstrated the Labour leader’s ‘rank hypocrisy’.

He
added: ‘In public he slams tax avoidance, yet behind closed doors he’s 
happy to rubber-stamp whopping donations from tax avoidance schemes.’

Mr
Mills told the Daily Telegraph he would have had to give far more to 
provide Labour with the same level of assistance if he had used 
conventional means for making his donation.

‘To
be honest with you, it is the most tax efficient way of doing this,’ he
said. ‘Otherwise you get no tax relief on donations to political 
parties for understandable reasons.

‘If you donate to a political party out of a tax-paid income, up until April it was 50 per cent and now it is 45. That means if it is £100,000, the Labour Party gets £55,000 and the Government gets £45,000.’

Mr Mills’s donation – by far the biggest private donation received by Labour this year – is thought to be the first ever made to a political party in shares.

He said the decision to use the controversial method had ‘emerged’ during discussions with senior Labour figures. ‘It emerged… came out of a discussion I had with them about the best way of doing it,’ he said.

‘It is a good model (for donating). Labour has got people who deal with compliance and the legal side of all this. They are very sensitive nowadays.’

Under the terms of the deal, Labour is reported to be the owner of the shares, which will be valued each year by the company’s auditors. The party will receive an annual dividend payment on its shareholding.

A Labour Party spokesman last night insisted the donation complied fully with electoral laws.

He added: ‘This donation has been declared in full to the Electoral Commission in line with party funding rules and it appears on the Commission’s public register. It is standard practice to discuss donations’ permissibility with the Electoral Commission.’
