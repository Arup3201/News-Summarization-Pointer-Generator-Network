Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev last night dramatically intervened in media tycoon Alexander Lebedev’s battle to avoid jail over a TV studio fracas with a property mogul.

‘It was no more than a minor incident that does not even deserve a court hearing,’ said the 82-year-old Russian elder statesman.

His statement amounts to a powerful criticism of the legal system under President Vladimir Putin which has doggedly pursued the newspaper owner in what is widely condemned as a show trial.

Lebedev, 53, faces up to five years in jail after being charged with the draconian offence of hooliganism motivated by ‘political hatred’ for striking businessman Sergei Polonsky after a barrage of provocation.

Unlike Polonsky, who is believed to have jumped bail in Cambodia and is now thought to be hiding in an Israeli bolthole, Lebedev – funder of the Independent titles and the London Evening Standard – has rejected the chance to flee abroad and is ready to face the Russian courts.

Polonsky is seeking to gain Israeli citizenship to avoid being extradited to Russia where he faces separate legal action over £121 million fraud and embezzlement charges.

‘I know Alexander as a good man, a person who is free in his judgment and speaks his mind on the economy, public affairs and politics,’ Gorbachev told The Mail on Sunday in a exclusive statement last night.

‘He takes full advantage of the freedoms brought to our country by Perestroika. I also know him as a civil society activist who has supported charitable projects particularly in the area of children’s health.

‘On the eve of the 300 anniversary of St Petersburg, he financed the building of the Childhood Leukaemia Centre which was named after Raisa Gorbachev. I think that speaks to his character as a moral man.”

The charge against Lebedev is controversial, with some supporters claiming it is driven by the Kremlin and amounts to an attack on media freedom. Lebedev, with Gorbachev, is an owner of hard-hitting investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta which regularly exposes alleged corruption in the Russian elite.

However, Lebedev last week hit out at the Western media for portraying the legal action as a vendetta by Putin. Lebedev’s son Evgeny – now in charge of the family’s UK newspaper interests – has said his father’s life could be in danger if he is sent to prison.

The case resumes tomorrow and a verdict is likely in July. ‘My choice is between, I think, a year in prison and a big fine,’ said the tycoon after Friday’s hearing.

It has been branded a farce with one prosecution witness asked to give evidence after she stepped off a bus in Moscow, purely on the basis that she saw the TV show.

Last week, the judge refused to probe claims that Polonsky is in Israel and not – as his lawyers claim – on bail in Cambodia where he is accused of kidnapping and assault.
