It is a common problem, someone delivering a package realises the recipient isn't home and is forced to take alternative action.

But CCTV footage outside one home in Brighton appears to show this delivery man taking a somewhat unorthodox approach to the situation.

After knocking on the door to no avail, he signs for the package himself, before leaving it hidden in the customer's garage.

Breaking the rules: A delivery man is spotted on CCTV camera signing for a package on behalf of a family when they are away

The date stamp on the video shows the delivery taking place on December 4 last year.

Despite leaving the package behind, the courier, working for Parcelforce, failed to inform the homeowner Ewan Cassidy, 49, where his parcel was.

Consequently, Ewan says he 'spent days chasing the delivery' with the delivery company, part of the Royal Mail Group, because he had no clue it was waiting for him at home all along.

'When we called, we were told it has been delivered and we signed for it, making out we were trying to pull a fast one.

Is that his signature move? After forging their name, he opens up their garage and drops off the parcel

However, once the company got back to him confirming the date and time of the drop off, Ewan was able to check their CCTV and discover just what had happened to his order - which contained a control desk for a lighting company.

'You can't just go into somebody's property,' Ewan adds, 'It's illegal as is forging someone's signature. 

'The garage doors were locked but he somehow managed to wiggle it open which has highlighted a weakness that I have since tended to.' 

After complaining to customer service about the delivery man's actions, he was reassured that the action was a 'serious issue' and soon learned that the courier was sacked.  

Parcelforce has told MailOnline: 'We always seek to provide the highest levels of service for our customers and are disappointed that our employee did not follow the correct procedures on this occasion. 

'We fully investigated the matter and took appropriate disciplinary action. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused to the customer.'

A good deed? Whether he thought he was being helpful by dropping off the parcel or merely was being too lazy to take it back to his van, the courier did not get a good response from the residents

'We spent days chasing the delivery!' Since he left no note, the family were unaware that their parcel had arrived
