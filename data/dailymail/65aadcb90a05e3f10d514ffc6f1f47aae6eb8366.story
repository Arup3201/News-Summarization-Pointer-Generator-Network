She is drinking in the beauty of one of the most celebrated images of the English countryside.

And let us hope this young art lover had a good, long look.

Last night there were fears that Constable’s masterpiece The Lock could disappear forever from public view after it was sold to a private buyer for £22.4million.

Too expensive for British museums: There are fears the landscape may never be seen in public again after it was bought by a private buyer for £22.4million

Experts had warned that cash-strapped British museums and galleries were unlikely to pay up to save it for the nation when it was auctioned at Christie’s in London.

And with no obligation for the new owner to keep it on display, it may be the last time we have the chance to see for ourselves the genius of each brush stroke.

The landscape, part of a succession Constable nicknamed ‘the six-footers’, and one of his favourites, was up for auction for only the second time in its history.

Back in 1824, MP James Morrison paid 150 guineas for it, the equivalent of around £20,000 today.

Then in 1990 it was sold for £10.8million to Dutch-born billionaire Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza and his wife Carmen ‘Tita’ Thyssen, a former Miss Spain.

That was a record for a British work of art and it was not surpassed until 2006, when a view of Venice by Constable’s rival JMW Turner was bought for £20.5million.

Three months ago Edvard Munch’s iconic masterpiece The Scream became the most expensive work of art to be sold at auction, for the dollar equivalent of £74million.

Last night at Christie’s, The Lock took only two minutes to reach its comparatively modest price and was bought by an anonymous telephone bidder. The sale is a joint record for an Old Master at Christie’s, making the Lock one of the most expensive British paintings ever sold.

Quintessentially English: The Lock, like another of his great works, The Hay Wain (pictured), epitomises Constable's lifelong love of Suffolk and was the fifth of six landscapes he painted of the Stour Valley

Although its original price tag has multiplied nearly 140,000 times since it was first sold at the Royal Academy, counting on it for a massive return on the 1990 price was a gamble.

Some experts calculated that it has actually lost value in real terms over the last 22 years.

The Lock, like another of his great works, The Hay Wain, epitomises Constable’s lifelong love of the Suffolk countryside. The Lock was the fifth of six landscapes he painted of the Stour Valley.

It depicts a figure struggling to open a canal gate at Dedham Lock near Flatford Mill to allow a barge to pass.

After it was sold in 1990 to the Thyssen-Bornemisza family it had been housed in Madrid’s Bornemisza Museum. Last night art expert Godfrey Barker confirmed the painting had probably gone to a UK private buyer.

‘Constable does not cross borders,’ he said. ‘A sunbaked scene in Suffolk is too British for the international market. It is most likely to have gone to a British private buyer as our museums don’t have that kind of money.’
