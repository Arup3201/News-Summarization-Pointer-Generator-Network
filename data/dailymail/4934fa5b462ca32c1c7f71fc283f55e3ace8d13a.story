Ten years on, Lord Prescott has finally admitted that the disastrous war in Iraq was ‘unjustified’.

The Labour politician, who was Deputy Prime Minister at the time, said he had supported the intervention because he was assured that George Bush had a plan to bring peace to the Middle East.

But the US president apparently lost interest in solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and now Lord Prescott says he thought the war was wrong.

During an interview on the BBC’s This Week programme Lord Prescott said that despite changing his view of the conflict, he could not ‘just disown’ his previous support for the invasion.

Lord Prescott added: ‘I go through my thoughts trying to justify it, but it cannot be justified as an intervention.’

Britain lost 179 servicemen and women in the US-led Iraq conflict, which began on March 20, 2003. At least 100,000 Iraqis died.

Earlier this week Tony Blair, the Prime Minister at the time, admitted Iraq was not as safe as he would like it to be, but insisted the situation would be far worse now had Saddam been left in power.

Declining once again to offer an apology for the invasion, he said: ‘If we hadn’t removed Saddam from power just think, for example, what would be happening if these Arab revolutions were continuing now and Saddam, who’s probably 20 times as bad as Assad in Syria, was trying to suppress an uprising in Iraq?

Think of the consequences of leaving that regime in power. So when you say “do you think of the loss of life since 2003?” of course I do. You would have to be inhumane not to, but think of what would have happened if he had been left there.’

Lord Prescott told the BBC on Thursday that, ahead of the invasion, Mr Blair had been keen ‘to get the US in’ on the United Nation’s approach to dealing with Iraq.

He said that after Mr Blair had sent him to speak to vice-president Dick Cheney, he told the PM it was clear ‘they’re going to go in without you; whether you come with them or not, it doesn’t matter to the Americans – they’re getting ready’.

Lord Prescott added: ‘But I tell you something that persuaded me.

'You know Bush was quite prepared to have a plan for Israel and the whole problem in regard to Palestine and he promised. And, therefore, that plan was something.’

But Lord Prescott said the plan ‘fell apart as it often does in American politics because the influence domestically is too great’.

The former deputy Labour leader said that, despite these factors, ‘at the end of the day, Tony Blair  obviously said to himself, “I’ve promised to do this and I’m going to do it”, and that’s today’s consequences.’

Lord Prescott’s comments go further than the previous doubts he has expressed over the Iraq War.

In 2009 he admitted in the New Statesman magazine that he wondered how he had agreed to go along with Britain’s participation in the war.

A year later he gave evidence to the Chilcot Inquiry, when he revealed he had doubts about the intelligence on Saddam Hussein’s weapons programmes before the invasion.
