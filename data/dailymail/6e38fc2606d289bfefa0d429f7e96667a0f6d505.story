NFL star Adrian Peterson will plead not guilty to allegations that he abused his four-year-old son by severely whipping him with a wooden switch, it was claimed today.

In a statement to ESPN, Mary Flood, a spokesman for Peterson's lawyer Rusty Hardin, said: 'If the court asks for a plea tomorrow [and we do expect that to happen] it will very definitely be NOT guilty.'

She added that she hoped a trial date would be discussed at the 29-year-old's initial appearance at court in Montgomery County, Texas, but said: 'We don't yet know how the court's docket is looking.'

It comes as Peterson has posted a series of tweets criticizing the public for 'believing anything' following a shocking report on his previous antics and charity by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.

Couple: NFL star Adrian Peterson (pictured with his wife Ashley in July) will plead not guilty to allegations that he abused his four-year-old son by severely whipping him with a wooden switch, it was claimed today

Criticism: It comes as Peterson has posted a series of tweets criticising the public for 'believing anything' (pictured) following a shocking report on his previous antics and charity by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune

Ambiguous remark: Despite the timing of his message - just hours after his charity was accused of improperly using tens of thousands dollars worth of funds in the report - Peterson later added: 'Just in-general!'

The Minnesota Vikings running back wrote to his one million followers: 'It's SAD how people these days will believe anything reported by media sources that don't take the time to be GREAT.'

Despite the timing of his message - just hours after the report accused his charity of improperly using tens of thousands dollars worth of funds - he later added: 'Just in-general!'

Peterson, who has been sidelined for most of this season, allegedly left his son with visible wounds to his thighs, backside and genitals following the 'disciplinary'  beating at his Texas home in May.

He is due to appear at court at 10am tomorrow on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child. It is not known whether he will be asked for a plea or given a trial date. 

Unless Mr Hardin is able to secure a quick trial date - a task that typically takes around nine to 12 months -  and convince a jury that Peterson did not violate Texas's corporal punishment law, it is likely the player's 2014 season is over. 

'I hope we learn more tomorrow,' Ms Flood said. 'But it's possible that we won't get a date tomorrow and we'll just get the beginnings of discussions about a date.'

On the field: Peterson (pictured), the Vikings highest-paid player with a six-year, $86million contract, turned himself into police in his hometown of Spring, Texas, on Saturday after police issued an arrest warrant

Peterson, the Vikings highest-paid player with a six-year, $86million contract, turned himself into police in his hometown of Spring, Texas, on Saturday after detectives issued an arrest warrant.

Although he has admitted to whipping his son, his attorney claims he was only using the discipline he himself had received as a child growing up in East Texas.

Following the felony abuse charges, the player apologized but defended his actions, saying: 'I am not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser.

'I am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury.

Another allegation: The footballer has also been accused of abusing another of his children while discipline him, but no charges have been made. Above, the boy is seen with a head injury

'No one can understand the hurt that I feel for my son and for the harm I caused him. My goal is always to teach my son right from wrong and that’s what I tried to do that day.'

He added that he has seen a psychologist, who told him that there are usually better ways to discipline children than hitting them, and will 'reevaluate' his forms of discipline in the future. 

In the Star-Tribune report, which was published yesterday, Peterson was claimed to have six children by six different mothers.

He was also said to have previously been the subject of a lengthy police investigation for sexual battery after a booze-fueled sex party that he invited his underage brother to.

And his charity was claimed to have given out tens of thousands of dollars to nonprofit organizations that say they never saw a dime.

Despite the claims, Peterson has never been accused of wrongdoing with his charity. 

The Vikings agreed to drop Peterson from the team until the case is wrapped up in the courts after sponsors started to pull out of their agreements. The player is banned from all team activities.

Peterson projected a strong family image before his arrest. His father is a convicted felony who was in prison by the time he went to college on a football scholarship, but he has repeatedly talked about his relationship with his mother Bonita Brown. 

However, he's been quiet about the other part of his family life, including his children, refusing even to say publicly how many he has.

In October 2013, his two-year-old son died in South Dakota after being beaten to death by the mother's boyfriend. 

Last month, the footballer was also accused of injuring another four-year-old son while disciplining him at his gated mansion in The Woodlands last June.

Bankable: The Minnesota Vikings have invested heavily in Peterson's image. He was the only player invited to a groundbreaking ceremony for the team's new stadium. He is seen here with owner Zygi Wilf

A photo showed the boy suffering from a head wound covered by two bandages, while other images revealed a scar over his right eye.

Peterson reportedly then sent the boy's mother a text message claiming his son had smacked his head on a car seat.

However, when she questioned him further, he is said to have later admitted hitting the child, texting: 'Be still n take ya whooping he would have saved the scare [scar]. He aight [all right]

He then wrote: 'I felt so bad, but he did it his self', according to KHOU 11 News Houston.  

Peterson later revealed  he had disciplined his son for cursing at his sibling, but refused to disclose his method of punishment, it is claimed.

Although the boy's mother filed a report with Child Protective Services, no charges were ever made against Peterson. The footballer's attorney declined to comment on the allegations.

In the latest case, Peterson faces six months to two years in state prison if convicted. However, as a first-time offender, he could be placed on probation instead.  

'My attorney has asked me not to discuss the facts of my pending case. I hope you can respect that request and help me honor it. I very much want the public to hear from me but I understand that it is not appropriate to talk about the facts in detail at this time. Nevertheless, I want everyone to understand how sorry I feel about the hurt I have brought to my child.

'I never wanted to be a distraction to the Vikings organization, the Minnesota community or to my teammates. I never imagined being in a position where the world is judging my parenting skills or calling me a child abuser because of the discipline I administered to my son.

'I voluntarily appeared before the grand jury several weeks ago to answer any and all questions they had. Before my grand jury appearance, I was interviewed by two different police agencies without an attorney. In each of these interviews I have said the same thing, and that is that I never ever intended to harm my son. I will say the same thing once I have my day in court.

'I have to live with the fact that when I disciplined my son the way I was disciplined as a child, I caused an injury that I never intended or thought would happen. I know that many people disagree with the way I disciplined my child. I also understand after meeting with a psychologist that there are other alternative ways of disciplining a child that may be more appropriate.

'I have learned a lot and have had to reevaluate how I discipline my son going forward. But deep in my heart I have always believed I could have been one of those kids that was lost in the streets without the discipline instilled in me by my parents and other relatives. I have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man. I love my son and I will continue to become a better parent and learn from any mistakes I ever make.

'I am not a perfect son. I am not a perfect husband. I am not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser. I am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury. No one can understand the hurt that I feel for my son and for the harm I caused him. My goal is always to teach my son right from wrong and that’s what I tried to do that day.

'I accept the fact that people feel very strongly about this issue and what they think about my conduct. Regardless of what others think, however, I love my son very much and I will continue to try to become a better father and person.'
