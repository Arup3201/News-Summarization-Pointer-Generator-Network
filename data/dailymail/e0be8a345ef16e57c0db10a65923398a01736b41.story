Downton Abbey is one of Britain's most successful television dramas.

And it seems the show has even influenced affluent households thousands of miles away in China.

Young Chinese people are paying £140 per day to train as butlers as an increasing number of wealthy families hire help, the People's Daily Online reported. 

Students at the International Butler Academy, in Chengdu, are drilled daily on ironing perfect creases into tablecloths, polishing silverware and identifying the correct cutlery to accompany an eight-course banquet.

Tasks also include balancing a platter  and placing food on a plate using just a fork and spoon.

Thomas Kaufmann, head instructor at the school, said: 'Downton Abbey is so famous here in China, that is the standard we are measured at.

'In the last few years the demand for butlers has become bigger and bigger. So it is logical for us to have teachers here.'

Mr Hu is one of dozens of students who have enrolled in the school's six-week course, which costs 40,000 yuan (£4,300).

He previously worked for U.S. casino magnate Steve Wynn, where tasks included wiping fingerprints from his phone and picking out particular chocolates from assortment packs.

He said: 'In the whole world there are more and more rich people. And especially in China, they want someone to take care of the smaller things.

'Butlers don't only serve wealthy families, but also multinational bosses. These people are successful. To make these kind of people feel relaxed and happy, I get a sense of achievement.'

Each morning classes start with a round of dusting, cleaning and polishing. 

Students are also expected to be able to correctly position a water jug. 

A butter-knife laid a centimetre out of place can lead to failure. Using rulers to make sure the distances are correct is not unknown.

Another student Chrissy Yan described the training - especially laying a table - as 'hard'.

But she said: 'I want to lead a team of Chinese butlers which will be known worldwide. I want to be asked to travel the world.'

The Academy, a beautiful house, opened in response to the increasing demand for domestic servants

A butler can typically expect to earn 20,000 yuan (£2,150) a month.

Their duties also include more mundane tasks such as fetching groceries, walking the dog, organising cleaning staff and polishing furniture and shoes.

The Academy is Dutch-run but partly backed by a Chinese real-estate firm, which offers butler services to potential homeowners as the property market gets tougher.

Mr Kaufmann added: 'It is easier to train a Chinese person in the butler trade than it is to train a Western butler in Chinese language and culture.' 

China is home to more than a million people with assets above £1million, according to wealth publisher Hurun. Between 2004 and 2010 the number of Chinese billionaires rose from three to 64

A short stroll away from the Academy a billboard for a new housing estate shows a grinning man in a suit and bow tie, promising to bring 'the elegance of British butlering service into everyday life'.

A spokesman for developer Langji Real Estate, said: 'We provide a butler for each private villa. Our customers have been very happy.'

The country's elite have employed servants for centuries and numbers are expected to swell in coming years.
