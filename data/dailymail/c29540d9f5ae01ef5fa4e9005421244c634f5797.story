Nestled in the rolling foothills of the French Pyrenees, market day in the tiny farming community of Bugarach has never been busier.

But shoppers aren't there to sample the fresh meat, wine and dairy for which the town is locally famed, they are there to pick up their own piece of end-of-the-world memorabilia.

This is because Bugarach - population 176 - has been earmarked by doomsday cults as the only place in the world which is going to survive Armageddon, scheduled for December 21 this year by an ancient Mayan prophecy.

Mayan teaching: According to prophecy/internet rumour, aliens will emerge from their 'spaceship garage' hidden deep within the town's imposing Pic de Bugarach mountain and pluck anyone in the vicinity to safety

Modern interpretations of the forecast, heavily stoked by internet rumour, predict that aliens will emerge from their 'spaceship garage' hidden deep within the town's imposing Pic de Bugarach mountain and pluck anyone in the vicinity to safety.

Now, Armageddon tourists and UFO spotters hoping for salvation are swarming to the two-street hamlet to collect a slice of Last Day history.

And it is an opportunity the village's shrewd inhabitants are eager not to pass up.

Souvenirs include 'authentic Bugarach stones' from Pic de Bugarach's rock-face itself, on sale for €1.50 (£1.20) a gram, and 'natural pyramids of pyrite iron' from underground.

Meanwhile, a bottle of water from the local spring, which can apparently cure a range of ailments, costs an eye-watering €15 (£12).

One landowner is even offering up his four-bedroom home with close up views of the mysterious peak for £1,200 a night.

But for those on a budget, he can offer camping space in his field (tent not included) for 400 euros a night.

'I possess a rare asset, the land of immortality,' he told La Depeche du Midi, the area's local daily.

Prime estate: One landowner is offering up his four-bedroom home on the slopes of the mysterious peak for £1,200 a night while, for those on a budget, he can offer a camping space in his field (tent not included) for £324

On
 the evening in question, tourists can pop to the local Italian 
restaurant for an 'Apocalypse pizza', washed down with a local vintner's
 'End Of The World' vintage.

If the predictions turn out to be wrong, they can celebrate with the same wine-seller's 'Survival Vintage', on sale a day later.

Ancient Mayans claimed that on December 21 2012, a
 5,125-year cycle known as the Long Count supposedly comes to a close.

Experts estimate the system, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns, starts counting at 3114 BC, and will have run through 13 baktuns, or 5,125 years, around December 21.

They say 13 was a significant number for the Maya, and the end of that cycle would be a milestone — but they have been keen to stress that it does not mark an end.

Conspiracy theorists nonetheless believe the Maya may have been privy to impending astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012, ranging from explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in Earth's magnetic field.

But Bugarach's mayor, Jean Pierre Delord, is worried about the numbers of New Agers arriving in the town.

Police and troops have been drafted in to deal with the sudden influx and stop believers from scaling the mountain. Although many believe this is merely a cover for the investigation of dozens of recent UFO sightings.

David, who quit his telecoms job in Tours to move to Bugarach, told The Sun: 'There are serious things going on here - I want to know what these objects are.

'Things exist and people have a right to know.'

While David, who would not reveal his surname, said he wasn't sure the world would actually end in three weeks, added: 'I do think the capitalist system is going to collapse then.'

But others have expressed anger at the town, blaming it for taking advantage of 'gullible' New Agers.

Eric Freysselinard, the prefect of the Aude county which includes Bugarach, said this week: 'I find it really outrageous to abuse the naivety of people and rush into commerce that defies common sense.'

The prophesy is based on an interpretation of the ancient Mayan calendar which claims an intergalactic planet is on a crash course with Earth and will impact on December 21 2012.

The French government has even warned of 
the risk of mass suicides in the country by people who believe the world
 will self-destruct next year.

Recent disasters - including the earthquake in Japan - as well as 
anxiety over pandemics and economic 
concerns - are creating a global climate of fear, which for some are 
omens of impending doom.

A report published yesterday by watchdog
 Miviludes said the picturesque village near Carcassonne should be 
monitored in the lead-up to the end of 2012.

Miviludes president Georges Fenech said: 'I think we need to be careful. We 
shouldn't get paranoid, but when you see what happened at Waco in the 
United States, we know this kind of thinking can influence vulnerable 
people.'

The internet is awash with myths about the hamlet.

These
 include beliefs that the mountain is surrounded by a magnetic force, 
that it is the site of a concealed alien base, or even that it contains 
an underground access to another world.

Doom: An ancient Mayan calendar, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns

Panic: The prophesy is based on an interpretation of the ancient Mayan calendar which claims an intergalactic planet is on a crash course with Earth and has spread panic across the world

Patrice Etienne, who runs an organic cafe in the village, said there have been an increased number of reports by walkers in the area of cameras jamming when they tried to take 
pictures and strange noises rumbling underground.

'We have seen military aircraft, 
police and soldiers,' he added. 'It’s like a Spielberg movie. They are looking for 
something. There is something in this mountain, definitely.'

Meanwhile, panic is spreading throughout Russia at such a rate over the Earth's pending doom, that Moscow’s minister of emergency situations has told its citizens that the world will not end on December 21.

Ancient Mayans claimed that is the day a 5,125-year cycle known as the Long Count in the Mayan calendar supposedly comes to a close. Many in Russia, where mystical thinking is popular, have taken notice.

Some are hoarding everyday items such as sugar, matches and candles, while inmates in a jail are said to have experienced a ‘collective mass psychosis’.

The ministry said it had access to ‘methods of monitoring what is occurring on Earth’, and could say with confidence all will be well.

However Russians were warned they still face the threats of ‘blizzards, ice storms, breakdowns in heat, electricity and water supply’.

An official from the Russian State Church has also spoken out to reassure frightened people.
