Torches are essential for power cuts and camping trips in the great outdoors.

And now there’s a powerful offering that beams white light so strong that it can fry an egg and start a small fire.

The Flashtorch is rugged enough for a trip with Bear Grylls as it is made from military-grade anodised aluminium and its creators claim it can survive in the harshest of environments.

Light fantastic! This powerful torch beams white light so strong that it can fry an egg and start a small fire.The light is 20,000 times more powerful than a standard torch

Output: 4,100 Lumens

Dimensions: 2inches x 2inches x 11inches (6cm x 5cm X 29cm)

Weight: 1.3lbs (610grams)

Power supply: Lithium-ion battery pack

Battery life: 10-40minutes

Bulb: 100W halogen

Bulb life: 2,000hours

Body: Aircraft-grade aluminium

Cost: $200 (£119)

Made by Wicked Lasers in Shanghai, the torch beams white light at 4,100 lumens, which is enough to melt a plastic cup and set a polystyrene plate alight.

It can also be used to illuminate large areas to give an adventurer a clear look at their surroundings at night.

The torch is adjustable so that users can choose to light a wide area or focus the powerful beam onto a single spot.

The light is funnelled through a reflector channel in the torch, which exits through a heat-resistant lens.

It has three power modes so the brightness can be tailored to a user’s needs.

The battery can deliver between 10 and 40 minutes of continuous use, depending on the power setting, while the halogen bulb has a 2,000-hour life so users will not have to replace them frequently.

The torch can be recharged without having to remove the lithium-ion battery and an ‘automatic lock-out mode’ means that it cannot be accidentally activated and burn a hole in a backpack.

It costs $199.95 (£119) and includes a battery and charger.
