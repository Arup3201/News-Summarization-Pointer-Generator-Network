A secret 'Cuban Twitter' that swept the communist country was set up and funded by the White House to 'inspire dissent', it has emerged.

ZunZuneo, local slang for 'tweet', drew in more than 40,000 users in just two years as the nation continues to limit free internet use.

Today it has emerged the project, launched in 2009, was covertly funded by the US Agency for International Development - and American contractors were gathering subscribers' personal data for political purposes.

Revelation: More than 40,000 Cubans were using ZunZuneo, a secret Twitter created for the communist country, without knowing it was funded and monitored by the US, gathering their information

Aid: The $1.6 million project, which evaded Cuba's strict internet stranglehold, was described by the US Agency for International Development as a 'basic humanitarian assistance'

It is unclear whether the scheme was legal under US law, which requires written authorisation of covert action by the president and congressional notification.

Publicly launched in 2009, Zunzuneo was branded a 'basic humanitarian assistance' in a USAID memo. It was stopped abruptly in 2012 when the government fund ended.

The Cuban government has a tight grip
 on information, and the country's leaders view the internet as a 'wild 
colt' that 'should be tamed'.

But ZunZuneo's
 leaders planned to push Cuba 'out of a stalemate through tactical and 
temporary initiatives, and get the transition process going again toward
 democratic change,' according to a 1,000-page document obtained by Associated Press. 

They hoped the network would reach 
critical mass so that dissidents could organize 'smart mobs' - mass 
gatherings called at a moment's notice - that could trigger political 
demonstrations, or 'renegotiate the balance of power between the state 
and society,' the documents reveal.

Cuba has a tight grip on information and leaders view the internet as a 'wild colt' to be tamed. In 2009, US contractor Alan Gross was jailed for trying to give Cubans internet using the government's exclusive access

Users' messages were screened to gather information such as gender, age and 'political tendencies'

Users' messages were to be screened, tracking information such as gender, age, 'receptiveness' and 'political tendencies'.

Ernesto Guerra, a Cuban user in Havana who never suspected the network 
had ties to Washington, said: 'It was such a marvelous thing. How was I supposed to realize that?

'It's not like there was a sign saying, "Welcome to ZunZuneo, brought to you by USAID."

'The moment when ZunZuneo disappeared was like a vacuum.'

The launch of Zunzuneo came months after the arrest and imprisonment of American contractor Alan Gross, who had been on a covert USAID mission to expand Cuban internet access using technology that only governments can use.

But according to newly-revealed memos, its creators were banned from divulging Washington's involvement in the venture.

Ernesto Guerra said ZunZuneo disappeared 'like a vacuum' in 2012 and nobody knew why

And the estimated $1.6 million spent on 
ZunZuneo was publicly earmarked for an unspecified project in Pakistan, 
public government data show. The documents do not specify exactly where the 
funds were spent.

'There will be absolutely no mention of 
United States government involvement,' according to a 2010 memo from 
Mobile Accord Inc., one of the project's creators. 'This is absolutely 
crucial for the long-term success of the service and to ensure the 
success of the Mission.'

Officials at USAID, which denies carrying out actions in secret, would not say who had approved the program or whether
 the White House was aware of it. The Cuban government declined a 
request for comment.

USAID said in a statement that it is 'proud of its work in Cuba to provide basic humanitarian assistance, promote human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to help information flow more freely to the Cuban people'.

The service was not offered in official mobile phone shops in Cuba, such as this, but spread covertly

The US Agency for International Development would not say who signed off the project, which was paid for by funds earmarked for an unspecified venture in Pakistan

It said they 'have lived under an authoritarian regime' for 50 years.

The agency added its work was found to be 'consistent with US law.'

In a 1,000-page document obtained by AP,
 ZunZuneo's organizers lay out a plan to build the social network slowly
 to avoid detection by the Cuban government.

But critics have blasted the covert venture as 'troubling'.

Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the US foreign operation's subcommittee, said: 'There is the risk to young, unsuspecting Cuban cellphone users who had no idea this was a U.S. government-funded activity.

'There is the clandestine nature of the program that was not disclosed to the appropriations subcommittee with oversight responsibility. And there is the fact that it was apparently activated shortly after Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor who was sent to Cuba to help provide citizens access to the Internet, was arrested.'  ***
