Furious villagers in eastern China have prevented the completion of a bridge with just 30ft left to go until it reached their side of the river, after they were refused compensation.

Work began on the crossing over the Xin`an River in Shitan, Zhejiang province, six years ago, after locals initially gave their blessing for construction to go ahead.

But work has now been stopped after the owners of houses close to the bank had their demands for compensation turned down. Now their neighbours on the other side are suing for loss of use of the crossing.

Stopped in its tracks: The half-built bridge in China's Zhejiang province which is at the centre of a legal dispute

Cut off point: Villagers on one side are now suing their neighbours on the other for stopping the bridge being built

'There are some homes very close to the other bank and the owners would not allow the bridge to touch their land unless they were compensated,' explained one local official. But the price they demanded was too high and the work stopped. Five years later, we are still waiting.'

As the delay dragged on a group of locals took the decision to sue their neighbours for compensation for loss of use of the crossing.

A village committee spokesman said: 'We want to settle this peacefully but they are blocking progress. The houses in question are very shabby and old and not worth anything like the compensation they are demanding.

'Our residents have had to make a long detour for five years just to cross the river - that needs compensation too,'

Pay out: According to a village spokesman, the owners of homes very close to the other bank would not allow the bridge to touch their land unless they were compensated
