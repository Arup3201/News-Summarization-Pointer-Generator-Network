Models were given some seriously hair raising dos at the ENIGMA Alternative Hair Show in the Royal Albert Hall yesterday.

From gravity-defying constructions to sculpted designs, hair was scraped, backcombed and coiffed into a range of wild forms.

However, the wacky styles, which were expertly created by various hairdressers, were all for a good cause.

Now that's hair raising! Models are styled by the Dmitry Vinokurov team before performing at the ENIGMA Alternative Hair Show

Prestigious: The Alternative Hair Show is one of the world's most prestigious hairdressing events

The Alternative Hair Show is one of 
the world's most prestigious hairdressing events, bringing together 
international teams of hair artists to showcase groundbreaking hair 
styling.

The show was 
launched 30 years ago by acclaimed hair designer Tony Rizzo to raise 
money for Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research following the death of his 
son Valentino. To date, over £9 million has been raised for the charity.

The
show promised to deliver a 'charged atmosphere of inspiration and 
celebration with imaginative performances and memorable hair artistry' 
and it didn't disappoint.
