The family of a girl who was beaten to death in 1985 is trying to stop one of the killers from releasing a memoir that could see her bank thousands.

Michelle 'Missy' Avila, 17, was drowned and stabbed by her two best friends Karen Severon and Laura Ann Doyle who left her face down beneath a log in Angeles National Forest, LA.

The pair were convicted of murder in 1990 and served 21 years in jail. 

Profiting? Karen Severson (right, today) has written a book about the day she murdered her friend Michelle 'Missy' Avila (pictured left aged 17 in 1985) before pretending to help the family find the killer for three years

But now, Severson, who has been working as a telemarketer since her release in 2011, is promoting a new memoir about the moment she set up Missy. 

Severson claims she will donate a portion of the profits to anti-bullying charities in Avila's name - but not all of it because 'I have to live, it's hard to get a job out there'.

The move has enraged Missy's family, who are desperately trying to approve 'Missy's Law' in California - which would bar convicts from profiting from their crimes.

'My daughter is dead in the ground and Karen is going to profit out of writing a book about her?

Brutal: The two girls drowned Avila face-down in the water, knifed off her hair and ripped out her hoop earrings

'And profit on it? No, there ought to be a law that that cannot happen,' Irene Avila told ABC7.com.

'Tell [Severson] to go to hell. I'm her worst nightmare!' 

Severson escaped justice for three years after the murder - and even moved into the victim's home with her two-year-old daughter, offering to help Missy's family find the killer.

Eventually after a tip-off from a witness, she was arrested and convicted.

The book: This is Karen's latest account of the event in 1985 and she is also planning a documentary

It emerged in court that the two girls had drowned Avila face-down in the water, knifed off her hair and ripped out her hoop earrings.

It was not until a 2002 parole hearing that Doyle admitted to luring Avila to her death. 

The 46-year-old murderer claims she will donate a portion of the profits to charity from her forthcoming book and a documentary she plans to make.

Nonetheless, Missy's family is enraged.

'We teach our children that crime doesn't pay, but in California it does pay,' said Avila's sister-in-law, Shavaun Avila, who is working with Crime Victims United to craft a new law to withstand constitutional scrutiny.

Opening up about her horrific crime, Severson said she killed Missy out of jealousy. 

'I pushed her,' she said. 'I was tired. I was frustrated. All this stuff, everything we were accusing her of, she knew she did it, but not one time did she say sorry.'

Dave Henshaw, Missy Avila's close friend, raged on a remembrance Facebook group: 'She is evil and you know, I will not forgive her! 

'I know we are supposed to be forgiving, and be better than that, but fuck it! I am over that. 

'I will not, and can not when she is able to do things like this. 

'And no I have not read this or the other on because I refuse to have any part of it and you know what, I was there. 

'I was there when she sat in Missy's room after the funeral and cried about Missy being gone. 

'I was there sitting at the funeral with the family and all of our friends wondering how, so piss off Karen, I will not forgive and hope someday, somehow you do see final justice. 

'I do hope when you meet your maker you are denied for the evil you have done.'

The Avila family has started working on their own documentary about Missy's life.
