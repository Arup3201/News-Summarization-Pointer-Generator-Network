An obsessed fathers’ rights campaigner posted a dead hedgehog through his ex-lover’s letterbox after their relationship ended, a court heard.

Spurned Simon Clayton – who was the centre of an international manhunt after abducting his own daughter – subjected writer Adele Nozedar to an 18-month campaign of harassment.

Magistrates heard how the 49-year-old set up a blog, posting comments about Ms Nozedar. And he ‘tagged’ her over 4,300 times in the rambling, online blog - where he sometimes posts as many as 18 entries a day.

He also created fake Facebook profiles in her name, all of which was in breach of a given a restraining order in 2010 barring him from contacting.

The pair had been in a two-month relationship but Clayton - who was jailed for abducting daughter Esti ahead of a custody battle in 2003 - refused to accept it was over.

Ms Nozedar - author of books Freaky Dreams and The Secret Language of Books, and the former boss of a record label whose roster included dance acts Leftfield, Moby and S-Express - told told the court of the torment the episode has caused.

In an impact statement, she said she had changed the route she drove to work and even closed down a business as a result of Clayton’s actions.

Prosecutor Sian Vaughan told magistrates in Brecon, Powys: ‘Ms Nozedar had been made to feel upset and nervous in her everyday activities and had been afraid of bumping into the defendant.

‘She describes how she changed the route of her drive to work as it had passed the caravan where the defendant lives, which had given her a feeling of dread.

‘He had an obsession with her and his was not the behaviour of a sane person.

‘He had mentioned her in his blog every day and she said he didn’t know why he hated her.’

He even publicised it by leaving comments on the Daily Express website, which had been serialising one of Ms Nozedar’s books.

Clayton, from Llanigon, near Hay-on-Wye, Powys, denied two charges of harassment, but was found guilty at trial.

Defending, Michael Davies said: ‘He fully recognises what he did and knows it was wrong and will not do it in the future.’

Magistrates imposed a new restraining order and gave Clayton a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work, and a costs order of £1,000.

In an impact statement, Ms Nozedar said: ‘Some things are not meant to be and he can’t seem to accept that, and I hope something can be done to stop him posting such nasty, vicious things online.’

Clayton was given a nine-month prison sentence in 2003 for taking daughter Esti on an unauthorised holiday during an access visit.

After police appeals and desperate pleas from former wife Aneta Clayton, he and Esti were found on a beach in Portugal six weeks later.

Mr Clayton now campaigns for fathers’ rights in family courts.
