With the rise of online dating, there has never before been as many ways of meeting potential partners as there is today.

But one single man has taken up a rather different, and apparently successful, approach in his bid to find his soulmate - plastering posters advertising his search for girlfriend a across New York.

Artist Dan Perino, 50, is pasting 500 flyers a day round Manhattan emblazoned with the message 'Looking for a Girlfriend', along with his picture and mobile number.

Artist Dan Perino, 50, has been plastering posters across New York advertising his search for a girlfriend

The posters, which Mr Perino sticks to walls, lampposts and telephone boxes, have seen him inundated with more than 1,600 calls in over a week - and he has now even got a couple of dates lined up.

He said: 'I'm not desperate - I just want to find a more meaningful relationship. I have already got a couple of dates lined up thanks to the posters.'

The artist from East Village turned his back on more modern match-making methods such as dating apps and sites after being single for two years following the break up of his marriage.

But in a spur of the moment move, he decided to print 500 flyers bearing the message: 'I'm really looking for a girlfriend. This is not a joke. Just tired of the singles scene and hoping to meet the right person. I am a professional artist and creative person. You know who you are. To me each and every person is beautiful. Open to the possibility of the relationship morphing into something more profound.'

In the first few hours after posting the initial batch, Mr Perino received more than 100 calls - and despite a number of those being prank calls, he decided to carry on the campaign for one whole month.

He is now even being recognised in the street as pictures of his posters are shared across social networking sites.

Mr Perino said: 'It has been interesting to see the reactions of people. You'd be surprised at the amount of female attention it has drawn.

'Of course there have been some odd phone calls. But there has been an overwhelming amount of women getting in touch too.

'My family and friends think I'm crazy, but they see it works. Some days I wake up to hundreds of texts.'

Some women however have not been too impressed by the campaign, with one female New Yorker telling local TV she thought it was 'kind of weird, and a little scary.'

Mr Perino remains confident his relentless flyer campaign will find him true love.

He said: 'It definitely works, it is just my choosing and pickiness that is holding it up.

'I'm abstaining from sex right now because I'm looking for the right girl, not just a sexual encounter - I've had plenty of opportunities for sex over all those phone calls.

'I thought at first that it would take a week, but I'm hopeful that within a month I'll have found the right girl.'
