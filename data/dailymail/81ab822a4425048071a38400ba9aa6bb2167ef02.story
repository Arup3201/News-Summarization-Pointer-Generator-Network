A manhunt has been launched to find a mother-of-three who has not been seen since her lunch break from a childcare center on Friday.

Jessica Padgett, 33, stepped out of Duck Duck Goose Child Care in Northampton, Pennsylvania, to call her husband and send a fax between 12.30pm and 2pm.

Police later found her phone and her car in a parking lot a mile from the center.

Missing: Jessica Padgett, 33, was last seen going on her lunch break from Duck Duck Goose Daycare to call her husband and send a fax at midday on Friday. Police found her phone in her car in a parking lot a mile away

Family members have appealed for witnesses that may have seen Mrs Padgett, described as 5'2", insisting her disappearance is out of the ordinary.

Her sister Kristi Davis wrote on Facebook: 'My sister is missing...She wouldn't run off, she has kids.'

She added: 'She hasn't answered phone calls or texts since 1pm.' 

 Investigators believe there is no sign of foul play but continue to probe the case.

'This is not something that happened at night,' said Jim Wilkins, a friend of Mrs Padgett's told NBC.

Appeal: This is what Mrs Padgett was wearing on Friday when she went missing in Northampton, PA

Fears: Mrs Padgett's sister says the disappearance is out of the ordinary as she is married with kids

'This was smack dab in the middle of the day. The community needs to be made aware because somebody out there knows something.'

According to colleagues, she was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt branded with the words 'Duck Duck Goose Staff' and grey sweatpants at the time of her disappearance.

Her hair was in a pony tail and she was driving a white Subaru Outback.

Anyone with information regarding the case should call Pennsylvania State Police Bethlehem Barracks at 610-861-2026.
