Spark, the QPR club mascot met with the five-year-old girl who was struck in the face by one of Yaya Toure's misplaced shots at Loftus Road on Saturday evening.

QPR's official website said that Chloe Power, who has been a season ticket holder with the R's for two years, was greeted by the cuddly tiger on Monday afternoon in the hope of making her memories of the experience a little more positive.

The City midfielder and QPR offered signed shirts to the young girl, with the former scribbling the word 'sorry' to the unfortunate toddler.

'QPR and Manchester City, especially Yaya Toure, were excellent in following this up after the game,' Chloe's parents, Natasha and Peter, told the QPR website.

'Chloe was a little dazed on Saturday evening, but she slept well and was her usual bright, bubbly self on Sunday.

'We'd like to thank QPR and City for showing their concern – it just goes to show that there's more to football than the result.

'Chloe is really excited about leading the QPR team out against Burnley – she's hoping she's a lucky mascot!'

Toure initially tweeted after the incident: 'Relieved to hear the girl my shot hit is OK. I was very worried,' after Sergio Aguero ensured his side came from behind twice to draw at Loftus Road.

He later added that he called Chloe Power and spoke to the young girl and her father.

'Just spoke to the lovely Chloe and her dad on the phone. So glad she is ok.'

QPR tweeted: 'We've just spoken to the young girl who was hit by Yaya Toure's shot - she's fine & will enjoy these shirts!' They posted a picture of the two shirts alongside the tweets.
