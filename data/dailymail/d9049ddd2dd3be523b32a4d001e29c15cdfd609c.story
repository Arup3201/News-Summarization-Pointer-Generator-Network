Toulouse won a closely-fought Champions Cup encounter against Montpellier 30-23 at the Stade Ernest-Wallon on Sunday.

Tries from Yohan Huget (two) and Jean-Marc Doussain helped to secure victory for Toulouse, who face Bath at the Recreation Ground next Saturday in their second match of the competition.

Toulouse fly-half Luke McAllister missed a penalty two minutes into the match but was on target from the tee nine minutes later to level after a Teddy Iribaren penalty had put Montpellier in front in the eighth minute.

Montpellier winger Samisoni Viriviri had an impressive running try disallowed shortly after the half-hour mark, but the visitors did get the opening try moments later.

Winger Timoci Nagusa strolled over unopposed down the blindside after a strong Montpellier scrum had left the Toulouse defence in tatters.

Scum-half Iribaren added the conversion to make it 10-3 but Toulouse hit back immediately with a second McAllister penalty before they took the lead when Huget beat Viriviri to a grubber kick and dotted down. McAllister added the extras to give Toulouse a 13-10 lead at half-time.

Iribaren was sin-binned 10 minutes into the second half for a professional foul but despite being down to 14 men Montpellier reclaimed the lead when centre Wynand Olivier touched down in the left corner.

Enzo Selponi, assuming the kicking duties in Iribaren's absence, nailed a difficult conversion to make the score 17-13.

Their lead lasted just 60 seconds as Huget collected McAllister's crossfield kick to cross for his second try of the game and Toby Flood, on for Florian Fritz, added the extras as Toulouse went into a 20-17 lead.

Toulouse then found themselves a man down when replacement tighthead prop Census Johnston received a yellow card for taking out Nagusa.

Iribaren returned to the action and drew Montpellier level with a 63rd-minute penalty but Toulouse led 27-20 when Flood converted Doussain's 66th-minute try, and the former Leicester man then stretched his side's lead to 10 points by kicking a 79th-minute penalty.

Replacement fly-half Benoit Paillaugue booted a penalty in the final minute to earn a losing bonus point for Montpellier, but they ran out of time to get anything else from the match.
