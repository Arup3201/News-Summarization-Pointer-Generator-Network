Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Burnley have lost none of their last 13 home matches against Aston Villa in all competitions (W8 D5 L0) dating back to 1959.

The Villans’ away record at Turf Moor is even worse in the league alone where they have won none of their last 23 visits dating back to 1936 (W0 D5 L18).

Aston Villa have scored a league low six goals and hit a league-low 24 shots on target this season.

Burnley have not won three top-flight games in a row since January 1975.

If the season had started on September 1, Villa would be bottom while Burnley would be 15th.

Aston Villa haven't won a league match at Burnley since 1936 and drew 1-1 on their last visit to Turf Moor in November 2009. Above, Gabriel Agbonlahor passes under pressure from Graham Alexander during the game

Last Monday, Gabriel Agbonlahor became the 48th player in Premier League history to score 70+ goals. He is level with Eric Cantona on 70.
