Are you on the hunt for an exciting new job? Do you count yourself as 'proactive' and 'enthusiastic'? If so, we know someone who may have the perfect role for you: The Queen.

That's right, Buckingham Palace is looking to hire a new household assistant responsible for cleaning the Queen's precious antiques, dusting her cushy bedroom and even running her bath.

The vacancy for a new member of 'H branch' of the Royal Household is being advertised on the British monarchy's official website, and states it is looking for someone 'specifically responsible for the care of guests and maintaining the cleanliness, presentation, and general upkeep of all accommodation'.

But with a basic salary of £276.92 per week, the role isn't exactly going to buy you a royal lifestyle.

Your new office? The Royal household are advertising for a new household assistant. The £14,400-a-year role will consist of general domestic tasks, as well as looking after guests

The advertisement specifies that chores will include 'personal maiding/valeting duties for guests as required'.

These tasks include 'packing and unpacking, pressing and preparing clothes, arranging dry cleaning, care of jewellery, running baths, assisting with dressing if required, and arranging the service of tea and breakfast trays'.

A good disposition is a prerequisite, considering that the applicant will have 'contact with members of the Royal family', and the successful party must, naturally, have an 'ability to maintain confidentiality'.

Grand: 800 staff work at the royal household, which comprises a staggering 775 rooms, all of which will need a good dusting

The £14,400-a-year role also demands the ability to 'use initiative', and hopefuls must have 'a motivated, pro-active attitude', according to the advert.

'Ominously, the servant must also be prepared to clean "internal glass", though the advert does not mention that the Palace has 760 windows. Nor does it mention whether changing light bulbs will be part of the job; the Palace has 40,000 of them,' writes Gordon Raynor of The Telegraph.

While accommodation and food are included, hopefuls will be required to travel to the likes of Balmoral throughout the year.

Currently, 800 staff work within the royal household, which comprises a staggering 775 rooms.
