A bill that would make it a criminal offense for first responders to take and share photographs of crime scenes passed the Massachusetts House Thursday and is now on its way to the state senate.

The bill is known as Amanda's Law after Chicopee girl Amanda Plasse who inspired it when she was murdered in 2011.

The 20-year-old was stabbed to death and found in her kitchen in a pool of blood, according to MassLive.

A bill inspired by the 2011 murder case of Amanda Plasse would make it illegal for first responders to take pictures of crime scenes and share them with people not involved in the case

It was later revealed by an internal 
investigation that Chicopee police officers on the scene took pictures 
of the body and shared them among people with no involvement in the 
investigation.

Her mother, Michelle Mathieson, has been fighting for legislation ever since.

'It's a common sense law. I am very pleased to hear what happened today,' Mathieson told CBS Springfield.

State Rep. Joseph Wagner was at the forefront of the legislation. saying he looked to similar legislation across the country.

Amanda's mother Michelle Mathieson, has been fighting for legislation ever since officers devastated her family by sharing pics of her daughter's death

'There are other states that have similar legislation and we looked 
at those to fashion the piece that we did,' he said. 'Certainly we had an example 
here in Chicopee.'

'I think from a public safety standpoint it makes sense,' he said.

Should the law pass the Senate and be signed by the governor, it would impose fines of up to $2,000 or up to a year in prison if a first responder is convicted.

Mathieson said she was grateful as her family felt betrayed by the incident.

The new law would make sharing crime scene images punishable by up to a year in prison or a $2,000 fine

'Oh my gosh it wasÂ shock,' she said. 'The people that were there to protect her, 
to uphold her dignity, disgraced her, myself and my family.'

While the shadow of those officer's actions still hangs over her, she believes that it is her duty to help prevent another family from feeling this pain.

'I will keep pushing to the end to let others know this is not OK,' she said.
