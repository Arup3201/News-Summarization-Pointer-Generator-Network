This is the chilling moment a gunman was caught on security camera just seconds before shooting a taxi driver three times.

The bearded man jumped into the back of a cab in the Bronx area of New York in the early hours of Sunday, police said. 

He then pulled out a gun and threatened driver Raphael Martinez, 54, in his cab around 5.10am when the driver did not understand his demands.

The unknown assailant threatened driver Raphael Martinez, 54, in his cab around 5.10am

The attack was captured on the in-car security cameras.

According to the New York Post, police said he shot at the cab driver five times, hitting him twice, before waiting until the wounded, married father of three stumbled outside the vehicle — and shot him again.

Police said the incident happened at White Plains Road and Lafayette Avenue in the Soundview section.

The victim was hospitalised but is now in a stable condition, at Jacobi Medical Center.

His brother Julian Martinez said: 'My brother was saying, ‘Wait! I don’t understand you!’ and [the perp] just started shooting.

'[The gunman] didn’t give him time,' Julian said. 'He just shot him. All he had was $8.'

Manny Lopez, a dispatcher at DAT, the livery service where the victim works, said that after the shooting, the driver had called for help via his radio.

Raphael Martinez was in stable condition last night.

The suspect, described as a man in his 20s, was last seen wearing a tan bubble jacket and a hooded sweatshirt with 'Abercrombie Fitch' written on the front as seen in the images here.

He shot Martinez five times - including twice in face. Fortunately he is in stable condition at a local hospital
