This is the moment a cheeky pelican flexed its muscles to swoop in and steal a fish from a cormorant.

The smaller bird had spent 10 minutes patiently diving for trout in the waters off Long Beach in California and had only just caught one when the pelican crashed into the water to grab the fish.

Although the brave cormorant put up a short struggle, it was no match for a bird more than five times its size, so eventually gave up its prized catch and was forced to swim away hungry.

Battle: Although the brave cormorant put up a short struggle, it was no match for the massive pelican

Photographer Andrew Lee, 52, watched as the helpless cormorant resigned itself to defeat.

Mr Lee, who named his series of photographs 'The Silver Bandit', said: 'I was there mainly to capture the ospreys diving for fish.

'These magnificent raptors usually compete with the cormorants, pelicans, and occasionally, the great blue herons for the same fish.'

'I followed this particular cormorant for about ten minutes. The bird made several dives without success.'

Mr Lee said after numerous dives, the cormorant eventually surfaced with a large trout still thrashing in its long beak.

Incoming: Mr Lee described the struggle between the birds as 'very noisy and aggressive'

Defeated: The cormorant eventually gave up its prized catch and was forced to swim away hungry

For the next few minutes the hungry bird struggled as it desperately tried to swallow its catch.

'The bird tried hard to position the fish for swallowing head first,' Mr Lee said.

'Nearby,
 a big white pelican saw all the commotion and, capitalising on the 
opportunity of an easy meal, flew over and tried to steal the catch,' he added.

In the ensuing struggle, which Mr Lee described as 'very noisy and aggressive' the pelican successfully stole the trout from the cormorant.

Mr Lee said cormorants are particularly skillful hunters because their beaks have a hook on the end which allows them to hold onto even the slipperiest of fish.

Over quickly: The fish fight lasted roughly 10 seconds, the photographer said. He added that he later saw the two birds drying themselves on the same pontoon acting 'like good neighours' once again

'This cormorant would most likely find 
and catch another fish to eat. And cormorants, given the opportunity, 
will also try to steal fish from the smaller osprey,' he added.

Mr Lee said the fight lasted about 10 seconds before the white pelican stole and swallowed the cormorant's catch. The cormorant, he said, then swam away 'very calmly'.

'Although the pelican stole the fish from the hard-working cormorant, there seemed to be no animosity between them,' he said.

'Later on, I saw both of them sharing the same spots on the pontoon, resting and drying themselves, like good neighbours... Maybe we could learn something about living in harmony,' he added.
