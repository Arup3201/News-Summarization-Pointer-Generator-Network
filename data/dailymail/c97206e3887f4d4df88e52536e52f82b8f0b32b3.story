When Sophie Dahl put out an appeal for £500,000 to save the her grandfather's writing hut, she had only the best intentions.

But perhaps she should have realised that in tough economic times, it doesn't look too good to go asking the public for money.

And the request is even stranger coming from a millionaire model, married to a millionaire singer and born into a family which earns huge royalties from Roald Dahl's classic children's books.

In danger: Roald Dahl's family say the shed where he wrote his books must be moved to a museum - and the public should pay for it

Wealthy: Sophie Dahl and her successful husband Jamie Cullum could afford to pay for the restoration themselves

The campaign is now facing a 
backlash from fans who think that the Dahl family should pay to move the
 writer's shed from his garden to a nearby museum.

One Twitter user pointed out that Ms Dahl, who found fame as a model and went on to transform herself into a TV chef, 'could earn [the money] on a single advertising modelling job'.

The Dahl family wants to move the writer's hut from the garden of his home, Gipsy House in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, to the nearby Roald Dahl Museum for public display.

The painstaking piece-by-piece move would stop the decay which has left the hut in imminent danger of collapse.

However, some observers have questioned why the public fundraising campaign, launched this morning on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, is necessary given the author's continuing commercial success.

Actor and writer Nicholas Pegg wrote 
on Twitter: 'Top model (& Jamie Cullum's wife) Sophie Dahl wants us 
to raise £0.5 million to save her bestselling grandpa's shed. Am I 
missing something?'

He later posted: 'A preposterously wealthy family pleading for cash for its legacy? It sounds like a lost Dahl story!'

The wealth of Ms Dahl's jazz singer husband has been estimated at £5million, and she is believed to be worth a similar amount in her own right.

Writing: Roald Dahl used the hut in his garden as a refuge to write his books

Journalist Matthew Sweet joined the chorus of criticism, saying: 'Have I got this wrong? The international model and TV star Sophie Dahl is asking US for money to restore a shed?'

Amelia Foster, director of the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre, told the BBC that the Dahl family had already made 'a very significant financial contribution' to the campaign.

'We want to make sure that Roald Dahl fans in the future are able to see the hut,' she added, 'and to do that we really need to put the work and the time in now.'

The legendary children's author, who 
would have been 95 today, visited the hut every day for 30 years in 
order to write. Only he was allowed in to the structure.

But
 the property has fallen into disrepair and there are fears that the 
building which gave birth to classics such as Charlie And The Chocolate 
Factory, Matilda, The BFG and James and the Giant Peach could fall apart
 unless something is done.

Backlash: Writers Janice Turner and Nicholas Pegg have both criticised Sophie Dahl's campaign via Twitter

The idea to move the shed came from the author's grandson, Luke Kelly, who was inspired by relocation of Francis Bacon's studio to the Hugh Lane gallery in Dublin.

Dahl's widow Felicity - known as Liccy - said: 'It is a forensic exercise, not only to retain the eccentric objects but more importantly the magical atmosphere that fed Roald's seemingly limitless imagination.'

Felicity inherited the bulk of the £2.8million the writer left in his will after his death in 1991 - worth nearly £5million in today's terms.

Sophie Dahl added: 'When my grandfather died, he left in his wake an aching gap, but also a palpable magic and limitless imagination, which is not exclusive to my family.

'It is now time for us to save the hut but, even more importantly, to share it.'
