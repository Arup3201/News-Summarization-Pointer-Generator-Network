More and more, the world wide web is where consumers confirm their desire for handbag brands, and increasingly, specific models.

And consumers shift from the boutique to their smartphones, tablets and computers to learn more about the products they covet.

The study also unveiled for the first time, a ranking and analysis of the most searched-for handbag brands within the luxury industry, based on the unbiased search inputs coming from global luxury consumers in major search engines.

The research examines over 130 brands, through 130 million+ searches, in eight countries.

Coach held the top spot as most-searched handbag brand, followed by Louis Vuitton and Chanel.

As for Mulberry, which ranked eighth globally, the study found that every nation has a varying taste in style.
