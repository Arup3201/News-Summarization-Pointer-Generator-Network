Antonio Valencia has apologised to Manchester United's players and fans after his mistakes helped Arsenal dump his side out of the FA Cup in Monday's quarter-final defeat.

The cup exit effectively ended any hopes of silverware ended up at Old Trafford this season - and Valencia more than played his part in a dismal display from Louis van Gaal's side.

The midfielder-cum-defender put in a weak challenge and allowed Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to set up Nacho Monreal for Arsenal's first before playing a poor backpass to set up Danny Welbeck for his second-half winner.

Valencia was panned by fans and television pundits alike for his awful performance, and the 29-year-old has now offered up an apology for his showing.

'I want to apologise to my team-mates and the fans of Manchester United,' Valencia said on Instagram.

'Tomorrow is another day and keep working,' he added before tagging team-mates Marcos Rojo, Juan Mata, Ander Herrera, Rafael and Robin van Persie in the message.

Former United captain Roy Keane called Valencia's defensive contribution 'disgraceful' and accused the Ecuadorian of 'downing tools' in his television analysis.

And things got even worse for Van Gaal's first choice at right back on Tuesday when Rafael put in a brilliant - and goalscoring - performance for United's Under 21s to pile the pressure on Valencia ahead of Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Tottenham Hotspur.
