The police case against two Burmese bar workers arrested for the murder of two British backpackers is in danger of collapse, after prosecutors warned the investigation was full of holes.

Burmese migrants Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, were arrested last week for allegedly bludgeoning Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, to death on the island of Koh Tai last month. 

But the regional prosecution office in the Thai city of Surit Thani, which is responsible for Koh Tai, said the 300-page police report lacked complete evidence.

Burmese suspects Zaw Lin (left) and Win Zaw Htun (right), both 21, claim they were made their confession under torture and were forced to perform re-enactment 

Police have now been given until next Thursday to substantiate the report with more evidence, the Bangkok Post reported last night. 

It comes after Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha defended the 'botched' police investigation amid claims that two suspects were tortured into confessing.

Mr Tawatchai Siengiaew, who is in charge of the case, denied that the evidence had been thrown out, but admitted the report was incomplete.

He added that the legal process would not proceed against the arrested men until the prosecution office was satisfied it was watertight.

The men are legally able to be held until next Wednesday, but the prosecutor said their detention would be extended by 12 days, regardless of what additional information is submitted by police.

He said: ‘The police report still has some holes in it and we have asked for it to be substantiated with more evidence.

'Prosecutors will promptly consider the report once it is complete and make the decision on the indictment.'

The bodies of the two tourists were found on Sairee beach on the southern island of Koh Tao, famous for its coral reefs and diving, on September 15.  

Last week, the two suspects were arrested and paraded by police at a news conference. They also re-enacted the brutal assault.

Police said the arrested men had confessed to the crime - despite the fact that the two had yet to appear in court to face any charge and speak for themselves.  

Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said police would not dare catch the wrong person

But their lawyer claimed their confessions and re-enactment were made under duress.

They have now reportedly retracted their confessions, amid allegations of torture used against them. 

Yesterday, the country's Prime Minister urged critics to allow investigators to 'do their work'.

'I would like the media to stop speculation and let investigators do their work,' Prayuth told reporters after landing back in Bangkok following a two-day visit to Myanmar. 

'We must build foreign confidence and make Britain and other foreign nations understand. They might be a little surprised why the criminals were caught so quickly. I myself was excited. 

'I want all Thais to stop and think that authorities have procedures in place. Nobody would dare catch the wrong person because this is a case of big international interest.'

Around 10 protesters gathered in front of City Hall in Myanmar's capital Yangon on Friday during Prayuth's visit to the city calling for a fair trial.

Rights activist Nay Myo Zin said: 'I would like to urge our government to put pressure (on Thailand) and get help from the international community so that the real story can be found out.'

The suspects' lawyer, Aung Myo Thant, has called the case a 'set-up'. He was not available for comment. 

The inquiry has been dogged from the outset by contradictory statements by officials. 

Police were widely accused of bungling the investigation, including chasing the wrong leads and failing to seal off the crime scene quickly enough. Pressure grew for them to solve the crime quickly. 

Officers also came under intense criticism amid claims that they had allowed the crime scene to be compromised by preventing people from walking all over it.

They have also been accused of mishandling DNA testing and of torturing friends of the arrested men.

Because of what many are saying is police inefficiency - criticisms that appear to be supported now by prosecutors saying that the case has holes in it - fears are growing that the real killers might still be at large on the popular holiday island.

Koh Tao is now enjoying a surge in tourism, with most of its hotels full, following the widespread belief that the island was safe following the arrest of the Burmese men. 

Myanmar President Thein Sein urged the Thai Prime Minister to offer the suspects as much protection as possible.

'The entire people, the media and the civic society in this country are watching this issue very attentively,' Thein Sein said, according to an official in the president's office.

'I would like to ask for justice and fairness in handling this case. It is also concerned with our bilateral relations. Of course they should be liable to punishment if they are really guilty, but the trial should be based on fairness and justice.'

Responding to Thein Sein, Prayuth said: 'They are not the culprits yet. We will handle this case with special attention, very fairly, so that we can win the trust of Myanmar people and the international community.' 

Director-general of the Central Institute of Forensic Science, Khunying Porntip Rojanasunan, questioned methodology used in the case.

'The weak point (in the investigation) is that police do not understand that the case requires a forensic pathologist,' she was quoted as saying by the Bangkok Post English-language paper.

Police have strongly denied allegations of abuse during the investigation and have stressed the importance of DNA evidence in the case.

DNA found on Witheridge matched samples taken from the two men, police said.
