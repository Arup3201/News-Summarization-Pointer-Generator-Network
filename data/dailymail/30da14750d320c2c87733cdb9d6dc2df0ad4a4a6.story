He’s flashed his toned torso in skin-tight briefs for H&M, looked suave in a Jaguar sports car to promote their latest super-sleek model and gazed down at us from many a billboard to promote everything from fashion brands to his own scent. 

But David Beckham’s latest brand appearance is somewhat less sexy as he gives a cheesy grin on a bottle of Japanese breath freshener.  

Victoria Beckham's tweet to tell the world about David's quirky new brand association

The above picture was tweeted by Victoria Beckham this weekend with the caption “Genius! Fresh breath Becks!”

Perhaps he feels it’s a worthwhile investment given all those fish oil supplements he’s reported to take, which don’t conjure particularly favourable ideas of Becks’s breath. 

He can't have put his face to this brand just for the cash, because he's certainly not short.

He earned more than £16.5 million from personal sponsorship deals last year, in his final full season as a footballer.

The former England captain retired from playing in May 2013 after five months at Paris Saint-Germain, having left Major League Soccer in December 2012 following more than five years at the Los Angeles Galaxy.

The accounts for Beckham’s company, Footwork Productions, showed that turnover rose in 2012 by 10 percent to £16.5 million pounds.

Earlier this month he was in China launching the new Jaguar just one day after celebrating wife Victoria's 40th birthday in LA.

The 38-year-old former footballer looked his usual dapper self at the 13th Beijing International Automotive Exhibition where he introduced the new Jaguar F-Type Coupe.

Beckham showed off a grey tailored designer suit with undertones of blue, and mirrored James Bond as he cooly stepped out of the white sports car.

But what’s most delighted his loyal fans of late is his new swimwear collection for H&M.

Proving himself to be the very best of models, the 38-year-old sportsman showcased his buff body and tattooed torso as he posed in trunks, swimshorts and boardshorts in a positively smouldering shoot by acclaimed photographer Glen Luchford.

Consisting of three different styles, the swimwear extension of the David Beckham Bodywear collection will be available online and in selected H&M stores from May 2014.

Luckily for Victoria, given his latest endorsement, not only does he look good, he smells minty fresh too.
