David Cameron faces a probe by the statistics watchdog after giving the clearest hint yet that the British economy is out of recession - before official data showed the economy grew by 1.0 per cent.

An increasingly buoyant Prime Minister told MPs that after falls in inflation and unemployment 'the good news will keep on coming'.

But the Prime Minister faced claims of breaking the law, because senior government figures get to see the economic growth figures 24 hours before they are made public - but must keep them secret.

The UK Statistics Authority is now investigating whether the Premier broke the rules.

David Cameron said drops in inflation and unemployment would be followed by more positive economic data

Mr Cameron’s remarks have been widely seen as confirmation that the longest double-dip recession since the Second World War is finally over.

Economists have predicted that today’s figures will show a return to growth, but Labour accused the PM of ‘playing fast and loose’ with the official data due to be released by the Official for National Statistics at 9.30am today.

A spokesman for the UK Statistics Authority said it had received a number of queries about the Prime Minister’s words, adding: 'We are going to look into it.'

UKSA chairman Andrew Dilnot has previously called for pre-release access to statistics to be removed. 'I just do not understand how a reasonable person could say that was necessary.''

Yesterday Damian McBride, a former Treasury and Downing Street advisor to Gordon Brown, tweeted: 'Just to be clear, the PM received tmrw's GDP figs at 9.30am today. His "good news" slip will cause a big row with the ONS, maybe more.

'Law is clear: "No indication of their content [may be] disclosed."'

Gross domestic product (GDP) - a broad measure for the total economy - grew by a higher than expected 1.0 per cent between July and 
September, ending three consecutive quarters of declining output.

There has been a run of good economic news for the government in recent weeks. There are now more people in work than at any point since records began in 1971, it emerged last week.

The Prime Minister said every new set of good figures sent Labour 'into a complete decline'

In the three months to August, 
unemployment dropped by 50,000 to 2.53million. Youth unemployment fell 
by 62,000 to 957,000, the lowest figure for over a year.

And in inflation in September dropped to 2.2 per cent, its lowest level for three years.

Labour leader Ed Miliband mocked Mr Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions for a 'disastrous week' which had seen the resignation of his chief whip and the unravelling of an energy policy.

But the
PM told the Commons: ‘It's only a bad week if you think it's bad that 
unemployment's coming down, it's only a bad week if you regret inflation
coming down.’

He said ‘every piece of good news’ sends Labour ‘into a complete decline’, adding: ‘I can tell him, the good news will keep on coming.’

Downing Street sought to play down the idea that he was referring to today’s GDP figures.

But a spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister clearly believes the government has the right policies. The economy is healing.’

However, Labour said Mr Cameron was wrong to pre-empt the ONS.

Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said:  'The Prime Minister seems to have let slip what we already knew – that the Olympics will help Britain finally emerge from the longest double-dip recession since the Second World War. The question is what the underlying growth rate of the economy is when we strip out the one-off Olympics and Bank Holiday effects.

'What really matters for jobs, living standards and the deficit is whether there is a strong and sustained recovery and whether and how we can catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years.

'Growth of one per cent would simply mean the economy is the same size as a year ago. A one-off boost from the Olympics is no substitute for a long-term strategy and should not breed yet more complacency from David Cameron and George Osborne.'

However, Downing Street insisted Mr Cameron was not directly referring to the official figures.

Britain emerged from recession in late 2009, but two years later the economy started shrinking again. While the end of the recession will be good news, the British economy is still struggling.

Record numbers of people are now in work, according to figures last week. This graph drawn from figures from the Office for National Statistics shows how many have had jobs since 1992 (in thousands)

In its latest World Economic Outlook, the Washington-based Fund said it expects the UK economy to shrink by 0.4 per cent this year - far worse than the 0.2 per cent growth forecast in July.

The bounce back to growth will also be tempered by warnings about the underlying health of the economy, with the recovery likely to be driven by one-off factors like the Olympics.

Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, warned any recovery was looking 'fragile, feeble and far from guaranteed'.

'Looking through the distortions to GDP in the second and third quarter, the likelihood is that the economy is eking out limited growth,' he added.

The economy shrank by 0.4 per cent in the second quarter of this year, according to the ONS, which was revised up gradually from an initial estimate of a 0.7 per cent decline.
