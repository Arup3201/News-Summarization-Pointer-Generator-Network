Computer and smartphone users in Sutton, Cleveland and Watford can surf the net faster than anyone else in Britain, a new survey has revealed.

Their broadband speeds are around three times quicker than internet users in Llandudno, Galashiels and Carlisle, who experience the slowest service.

The speeds were disclosed after an independent speed test carried out in 118 locations across the UK.

Speeds were highest in London, the South East, the North East, the North West and Northern Ireland

The study was carried out during the summer on behalf of the broadband information website thinkbroadband.

Researchers found computer and smartphone users in the London borough of Sutton experienced the best broadband speeds in the whole country.

The average download rate in Sutton is 19.8 megabits per second (mbps) and the average upload rate is 1.9mbps.

Llandrindod Wells in Mid Wales has the slowest average download speed of just 2.4mbps and an average upload rate of 0.7mbps.

Carlisle was found to have a broadband speed ranging fom 5.3 mbps to 0.6 mbps- one of the worst in the UK

1.     Sutton: 19.8 mbps; 1.9 mbps2.     Cleveland:18.7 mbps; 1.6 mbps3.     Watford:16.8 mbps; 0.7 mbps4.     Manchester:16.5 mbps;1.0 mbps 5.     Harrow:16.2 mbps; 1.7 mbps6.     Telford:16.1 mbps; 1.1 mbps 7.     Ilford:16.0 mbps; 1.6 mbps8.     Romford:16.0 mbps; 1.9 mbps 9.     Uxbridge:15.9 mbps; 1.7 mbps 10.   Enfield:15.8 mbps; 1.8 mbps

Speeds were highest in London, the South East, the North East, the North West and Northern Ireland, the analysis found.

They were poorest in Wales, the East of England and Scotland.

The survey also found that BT Retail has maintained its dominant hold on the broadband world with its 31.3 per cent market share.

It has around 6,780,000 broadband customers in the UK after launching an expansion drive. This includes around 21,700,000 fixed-line broadband connections.

Its closest rival is Sky which trails by around 10.5 percentage points.

Sebastien Lahtinen, co-founder of thinkbroadband.com, said: 'It is an extremely busy time for broadband in the UK, with criticism around the delayed rollout of superfast broadband, and the recent Government initiative to provide high speed connections for business in cities.'

He said that the campaign to boost British broadband speeds was now beginning to succeed.

But he added: 'It is still early days and there is long way to go until the 4million target is reached.'

A separate survey by 4G revealed that even if you live in a city with fast broadband, the actual speed of your internet will vary dramatically within the city

1.     Llandudno: 5.9 mbps; 0.7 mbps 2.     Galashiels: 5.6 mbps; 0.4 mbps 3.     Carlisle: 5.3 mbps; 0.6 mbps4.     Wrexham: 4.9 mbps; 0.6 mbps5.     Shrewsbury: 4.8 mbps; 0.8 mbps6.     Dumfries & Galloway: 4.7 mbps; 0.4 mbps7.     Inverness:4.4 mbps; 0.4 mbps 8.     Hereford: 3.9 mbps; 0.5 mbps9.     Kirkwall & Orkney:3.8 mbps; 0.4 mbps 10.   Llandrindod Wells:2.4 mbps; 0.4 mbps

Earlier this year, a survey by 4G revealed that even if you live in a city with fast broadband, the actual speed of your internet will vary dramatically within the city.

In
the worst case - Birmingham - there is a difference of up to 89 per 
cent between the fastest and slowest broadband, the report found.

Further swathes of consumers are 'stuck in the slow lane' in London, Bristol, Northampton and Glasgow, the study showed.

Data
collected during more than 900,000 speed tests revealed the locations 
which benefit from the fastest speeds were not necessarily closest to 
city or town centres.

In postcode district B42, which 
covers the areas of Perry Barr, Great Barr and Hamstead in Birmingham, 
broadband download speeds during the past six months have averaged 
20.9Mbps, the study showed.

Just a mile and a half away, in B35 (Castle Vale), average speeds were 89% slower, at just 2.2Mbps.

At this speed it would take approximately 11 hours to download a Blu-ray film, the report found.
