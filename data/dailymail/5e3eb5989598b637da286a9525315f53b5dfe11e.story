The British nurse who survived Ebola has returned to the country where he caught the infection.

William Pooley said he was 'delighted' to go back to Sierra Leone in West Africa as he attempts to prevent 'as many unnecessary deaths as possible'. 

The 29-year-old arrived in the capital Freetown yesterday and will now resume work in an Ebola isolation unit run by UK medical staff. 

Mr Pooley became the first confirmed Briton to contract Ebola and was flown back to the UK in August, where he was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

He said: 'I am delighted to be returning to Sierra Leone.

Today he met the International Development Secretary Justine Greening (second left) who is visiting the country to see how Britain's £125 million assistance package is helping 

Mr Pooley became the first confirmed Briton to contract Ebola and was flown back to the UK in August, where he was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London. He said: 'I am delighted to be returning to Sierra Leone

'I would like to once again thank the team at the Royal Free Hospital and the RAF who provided me with such excellent treatment and support.

'But the real emergency is in West Africa, and the teams out there need all the support we can give them.

'I am now looking forward to getting back out there and doing all I can to prevent as many unnecessary deaths as possible.'

More than 4,500 people are confirmed to have been killed by Ebola in West Africa this year, though its spread beyond the three worst affected countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone has been brought under control.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has estimated that the coming months could bring about 10,000 new cases per week. 

Mr Pooley will be working in the isolation unit at Connaught Hospital where he will train local staff and help to set up new isolation units, after previously treating patients in a government hospital in Kenema.

Mr Pooley was treated with the experimental drug ZMapp and left hospital on September 3 after making a full recovery.

Last week he said he was preparing to return to West Africa to help deal with the Ebola epidemic because it is 'something I need to do'.

Speaking in Whitehall in central London, the nurse said he knew his family and friends would be worried but they should be reassured by his potential immunity to the virus.

'There is still a lot of work to do out there and I am in the same or better position than when I chose to go out before,' Mr Pooley said.

'I know my mum and dad are worried but they support me because they know this is something I have to do.

'My potential immunity is very reassuring for them, or at least it should be, and I will be returning in a more organised fashion than when I was out there originally.'

Last month Mr Pooley, from Eyke in Suffolk, reportedly flew to the US to undergo a blood transfusion to help an American being treated for the virus.

He will join the King's Health Partners team, a partnership between King's College London and three NHS trusts - Guy's and St Thomas', King's College Hospital and South London and Maudsley.

Dr Oliver Johnson, programme director for the King's Sierra Leone Partnership, said: 'It is fantastic that Will has chosen to join our small team here at Connaught Hospital.

'The situation here in Freetown is getting worse by the day and so Will's experience and commitment will be vital as we do everything we can to stem the flow of cases.

'The best way of stopping Ebola spreading even further is to fight it at its source and I look forward to working with Will to do just that.'

It comes after a Spanish nursing assistant who became the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa was found to be clear of all traces of the virus.

A blood test has revealed that Teresa Romero's immune system has eliminated the infection from her body, according to a statement released by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's office.

More than 4,500 people have died from Ebola, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Britain's latest Ebola aid flight carrying vital medical supplies landed in Freetown on Saturday, International Development Secretary Justine Greening said.

A man suffering from Ebola virus lies on the floor outside a house in Port Loko Community, situated on the outskirts of Freetown, Sierra Leone. So far the epidemic has claimed more than 4,500 lives 

It was the UK's sixth aid flight and carried almost £900,000 worth of medical equipment needed for the 92 bed treatment facility in Kerry Town, including blood banks, centrifuges and protective equipment such as goggles and gloves.

The UK, which has committed £125 million to tackling Ebola, has put pressure on other wealthy countries to do more to combat the spread of the virus.

The Prime Minister has written to European Union leaders calling for them to double their contribution to one billion euro (£800 million) this week.

Today the International Development Secretary Justine Greening met Mr Pooley in Sierra Leone.

Ms Greening is on a two-day visit to see how Britain's £125 million assistance package is helping the country.

She will visit the site of a 92-bed Ebola treatment facility in Kerry Town, which is in the final stages of being constructed by British humanitarian and military experts, with the assistance of local contractors.

She will also visit an Ebola Training Academy for healthcare workers, funded by the Department for International Development.

Also today, UK-funded pick-up trucks which will be used in the Sierra Leone aid effort were loaded aboard the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Argus at a British naval base in Gibraltar.

The 32 vehicles were lifted on to the deck of the ship where they will remain until it reaches Freetown later next week.

The trucks will be used to transport staff, medicines and equipment around the country.

Ms Greening said: 'These vehicles will be vital to keep Ebola treatment centres running across the country. 

From transporting medical supplies to ensuring treatment centres are well stocked with protective clothing, they will help increase capacity and capability as we work to control and defeat Ebola in Sierra Leone.

There are more than 300 UK military personnel in Sierra Leone from all three services - Army, Navy and RAF - comprised of medics, engineers, logisticians and planners, and the figure will rise to around 750 personnel by the end of the month. 

Ebola situation is 'much worse' than before and being hindered by a lack of beds and lab facilities

A Welsh doctor who has returned to Liberia to treat victims of Ebola says the situation is 'much worse' than her first trip to the country in the summer.

Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from Cardiff, who has been back in Liberia since October 10, said though more aid agency workers are on the ground, there are not 'many more treatment facilities' and there remains a 'huge need for beds'. 

Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from Cardiff, who has returned to Liberia for a second time, said the situation is much worse in terms of the scale of the epidemic and needs to be urgently addressed 

The medic, who went through a self-imposed three-week quarantine following her first trip because the disease has a 21-day incubation period, said: 'We are working flat out and we do need more Western medics to volunteer. 

'Right now we also particularly need more laboratory facilities.'

She described conditions in the West African country as 'challenging' and said she has made some 'very difficult medical decisions' while treating patients.

Before leaving for her second trip she told the BBC she would find it difficult to turn away desperately ill patients knowing they would die, but was involved in a battle against an epidemic and could do only 'small things at the beginning'.

She told WalesOnline: 'The situation is much worse in terms of the scale of the epidemic and a lot needs to be done urgently to address this.

'We are struggling a lot with logistical constraints and the unavailability of laboratory testing, which has been promised by many organisations - but few have delivered on this promise in Liberia as yet.'

Dr MacDermott believes poverty is the root cause of the crisis. She explained she went to the country because she 'couldn't sit and watch people dying without trying to help'

Working for relief organisation Samaritan's Purse, she is developing 15 Ebola community care centres around Liberia.

She explained she went to the country because she 'couldn't sit and watch people dying without trying to help'. 

Despite suggestions deforestation linked to illegal logging is to blame by unleashing Ebola-infected fruit bats into contact with people, Dr MacDermott believes poverty is the root cause of the crisis.

She said: 'If you have nothing to feed your family on and you come across a dead monkey in the forest, it will feed your family for many days.

'If you know nothing about Ebola and your children are hungry you do whatever it takes to feed them and keep them healthy. 

'If we are looking for a root cause to address it needs to be poverty and the significantly poor infrastructures of these three countries which has enabled this epidemic to reach the levels it has.'
