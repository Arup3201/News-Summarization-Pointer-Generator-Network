Manchester City are the best paid sports side in the world but New York is the city that boasts the most teams in the top 20, a report has revealed.

Players at the Etihad earn on average £5.3million ($8.9m) a year - or £102,653 ($172,539) per week  - only £50,000 ($84,000) more than the baseball stars who play for the New York Yankees.

The NBA's Brooklyn Nets are seventh in the world's top 20, paying players £4.4million ($7.4m) a year and the New York Knicks are twelfth because stars are on £3.8million ($6.4m).

High earners: Manchester City, pictured scoring against Sunderland, have topped a global sports salary list, with their squad paid £5.3m a year - an average of more than £100,000 a week

Big hitters: The New York Yankees baseball team ranked second on the earners' list - where players earn £50,000 less than Man City stars on average

Five English Premier League sides make the top
 20 on the list, with league leaders Liverpool in 20th place, earning an average of £3.4million ($5.7m) per man per year.

Manchester
 United are at No 8 on £4.3million ($7.2m) per man per year, Champions League 
semi-finalists Chelsea are at 10, almost £4million ($6.7m) and Arsenal are at 11 on £3.9million a year ($6.6m).

Two giants from American baseball, the New York Yankees and the LA Dodgers, as well as the two giants of Spanish football, Real Madrid and Barcelona, fill out the top five behind City.

The top 10 also includes Bayern Munich at seven, and the Chicago Bulls of the NBA at nine.

The Global Sports Salaries Survey (GSSS), produced for ESPN The Magazine in the USA, has been tracking comparative pay at major sports teams for five years.

Top 12: The teams which crown the list are all from the UK, U.S., Spain and Germany

Coining it in: The Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team are third on the salary list with an average annual pay of £5.1m but they moved down from second place last year

Man City players were earning an average of just under £1.5million ($2.5m) a year each when Sheik Mansour arrived in 2008 but their pay has more than trebled in the six years of his ownership.

Chelsea have also seen their wages and 
fortunes soar since Roman Abramovich arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2003 
but foreign sugar-daddy ownership is not restricted to elite European 
football.

The Brooklyn Nets were bought in 2010 by one of Abramovich’s fellow Russian billionaires, Mikhail Prokhorov.

Not only is Prokhorov footing the Nets’ $102million (£61m) total payroll in 2013-14, or £4.5m per player this year, but he will need to pay an additional $70million (£42m) or thereabouts in luxury tax for exceeding the NBA’s wage cap.

The GSSS looks solely at earnings for 
playing sport, not for endorsements or other extra-curricular 
activities. The 2014 report considers 294 teams in 15 leagues in 12 
countries across seven different sports: football, baseball, basketball,
 gridiron, cricket, ice hockey and Aussie Rules football.

The
 report looks at numbers from either current or most recently completed 
seasons, depending on availability of accounts and other information.

The
 NBA is the highest-paying league as a whole, with 441 players at 30 
teams in the 2013-14 season earning an average of £2.98million ($5m) per
 year each.

The Premier
 League is the best paying football league in the world, with the 
average annual pay at £2.27million ($3.8m) per player.

On the list: Chelsea were 10th in the rankings with a £3.9m wage bill and still have a chance of winning the Premier League title this season

Wealth: Roman Abramovich has poured millions into Chelsea since he became owner in 2003

Close call: Arsenal are just behind Chelsea in the survey. They advanced to the final of the FA Cup at the weekend, beating Wigan on penalties at Wembley

Sneaking in: Liverpool came in 20th in the salary list with an annual spend of £3.4m on wages each year. That could increase if they win their first league title in 24 years next month

Overpaid? Manchester United came in eighth in the list but have fallen short in the Premier League and Champions League this season
