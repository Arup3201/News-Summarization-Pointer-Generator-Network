Starved: Johnathan Ramsey, 11, was locked in his bedroom by his father and stepmother and restricted to a diet of bread and water

A boy was slowly starved to death by his parents as a punishment for bad behaviour, police have said.

Johnathan Ramsey, 11, had not been seen for at least nine months after allegedly being locked in his bedroom by his father and stepmother and restricted to a diet of bread and water.

According to police, his weight fell from 90 to 60 pounds at the family's home in Dallas, Texas, leaving the young boy unable to walk and eventually leading to his death. 

Last August, Ramsey found his son unresponsive on the floor of his bedroom.

After
questioning the parents and an extensive search, the child's body was 
found wrapped in a sleeping bag in an abandoned storm shelter, where he 
had reportedly been dumped by his father.

His
father Aaron Ramsey, 34 and 31-year-old stepmother Elizabeth have been 
charged with first-degree felony of injury to a child and were in 
custody last night on $500,000 bond. 

Police began looking for the boy on Friday after receiving a worried call from Johnathan's grandfather, according to Fox.

The boy's mother, who lives in New 
Mexico, had also tried to get in touch with her son but was always told 
by his father that he wasn't available to talk.

Ramsey
told police his son had violent episodes and claimed that the child 
punched his stepmother so hard in the stomach that she had a 
miscarriage, according to Dallas Morning News.
