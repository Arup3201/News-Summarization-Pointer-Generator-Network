Taylor Armstrong is taking charge of the memorial service arrangements for her estranged husband Russell, according to reports.

The reality star has begun making preparations for the service, thought to be next week.

Despite the couple being embroiled in a bitter divorce at the time of Russell's death, Taylor is determined to handle all the arrangements.

According to Radar Online, Russell's mother wishes for her son to be buried in Texas, but has yet to work out the details with his estranged wife.

A fried of the couple, Russ McCullough, has told TMZ that Russell 'begged' him for a bottle of Xanax days before his death.

McCullough, who appeared in episodes of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, alleges that he gave one pill to his friend after a particularly downcast dinner in which Russell could not afford to pay his bill.

According to McCullough, Russell was 
'distraught' over his portrayal on the reality series and said 'this is 
as bad as it gets,' he told TMZ.

McCullough refused to provide the bottle of Xanax as he feared his friends may abuse the drug, the website claims.

Today new pictures emerged showing Taylor with a mysterious cut above her eye, just four days before Russell's apparent suicide. 

The 40-year-old displayed the wound outside her Beverly Hills home last week as she carried boxes to her car.

In an interview last month, Taylor claimed she had been verbally and physically abused by her estranged husband Russell during their six year marriage.

However, friends of Taylor insist 
the cut was not inflicted by her estranged husband, and was inflicted 
while she was 'playing a game of football.'

Taylor
filed for divorce last month, alleging in an interview with People 
magazine that she and Russell, often had 'explosive arguments' in which 
he would 'curse and call her names. '

The magazine reported that there were times the 'arguments escalated into physical violence, which included grabbing her, throwing objects, shoving her and pulling her hair.'

Russell also acknowledged problems when questioned by the magazine.

'Did I push her? Yes, maybe things 
happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our 
lives that was not characteristic of who we were,' he said.

'This show 
has literally pushed us to the limit.'

The news comes as it was confirmed by the LA County Coroner that the cause of Russell's death was suicide by hanging.

His body was found on Monday at a house in Mulholland Drive.

Russell, who was aged 47 at the time of his death, has a record of domestic troubles.

Back in 1998, he received a conviction for battery in a domestic abuse case involving his then wife, Barbara Armstrong, according to Entertainment Tonight. 

Barbara
was granted a protective order against Russell and he was required to 
attend a one-year anger management program, as well as weekly Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings as part of his sentence.

Meanwhile, it has been alleged today that secrets about Russell's sexuality were about to be revealed, Radar reports.

According to sources close to the 47-year-old businessman, he was bisexual and worried that a tell-all book was going to out him.

An insider alleges to Radar: 'About 
six months ago Taylor confided in a close friend that she'd found 
history for a gay website called Adam4Adam.com on Russell's laptop.

'He
was also spending a lot of time at the gym, but his body wasn't 
changing, which she claims led her to believe he was meeting with men 
he'd met off the website and not spending time working out as he 
claimed,' the source added.

The insider said the book went into 'great detail' about Russell's bedroom preferences. 

'Not only was it going to come out that Russell was bisexual, but 
there were people on the record that were going to talk about the kind 
of sex he liked,' the source alleged to Radar. 

'He was into S&M type stuff; 
choking, and slapping.'

In the wake of the tragedy, U.S. 
network Bravo are said to be considering whether to air the new series 
of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills as planned on September 5.

Executives at the network are waiting 'at least 24 hours' before deciding.

'No decisions have been made as of yet,' a Bravo source told The New York Daily News.

A promo was released last month for the upcoming season, featuring Taylor, 
Camille Grammer, Kyle and Kim Richards, Lisa Vanderpump and Adrienne 
Maloof.

In the preview, Taylor was shown crying over the demise of her marriage to 
Russell, with whom she has a five-year-old daughter, Kennedy.

The newspaper reports that the couple allowed cameras to follow them as they attended couple's counselling.

The network released a statement expressing their condolences, following the news of Russell's death.

'All of us at Bravo are deeply saddened by this tragic news. Our sympathy and thoughts are with the 
Armstrong family at this difficult time.'

However, there are reports today that Russell's family are considering taking legal action against Bravo.

'Bravo is at fault and somebody needs to pay,' Russell’s step brother Wade Jackson told RadarOnline. 'Russell’s whole family was very close and they’re considering suing Bravo.'

Jackson also criticised Taylor for getting Russell involved in the show.

'In his line of business he didn’t 
want to be a public person on the show, but Taylor pushed him into it,' 
he claimed. 'He was really upset about the whole thing and told everyone
in the family that he didn’t want to be on the show.'

Taylor yesterday released a statement through her representative saying she is 'devastated by the tragic events.

'She requests privacy at this time so that she may comfort her young daughter.'

The
reality star was said to have raised the alarm on Monday after  
becoming concerned for Russell when he failed to show up for a meeting 
they had arranged, and did not respond to her phone calls and texts, TMZ
claim.

The website alleges that she went to the Mulholland Drive house where her ex was staying with a friend that evening, and raised the alarm with the home owner.

The owner then looked through Armstrong's bedroom window and saw his dead body hanging, TMZ claim.

In
the last interview before his death, Russell spoke to website Rumorfix last 
month about how difficult he found it to live with his new fame, and how
it contributed to his marriage break-up.

'It took our manageable problems and 
made them worse. We are very supportive of each other and love each 
other. I will support her as best I can moving forward.

'This is a devastating time. We had a wonderful marriage and I 
don’t want you to get the impression that Taylor and I are bitter enemies — 
we’re not.

'We have a beautiful five-year-old daughter who we both love.'

Ed Winter of the L.A Coroner’s Office said: 'He hung himself with no suicide note found.'

No drugs or alcohol were found in the bedroom where Russell died and he was fully clothed when his body was discovered.

Russell is survived by five-year-old Kennedy, Aiden, a 13-year-old son from a 
previous marriage and a an 11-year-old son with former fiancée Milette 
Fields.
