A former neo-Nazi who joined the Taliban and attacked an American base near the Afghan-Pakistan border has told a German court that he made a 'terrible mistake'.

The German man, who was only named as Thomas U, spoke of his regret over signing up for the German Taliban Mujahidin (DTM) and travelling with his wife to the war-torn Afgfhan-Pakistan border to become a terrorist, according to The Times.

His catalogue of complaints over his poorly thought-out decision included his fellow combatants' drug habits, a lack of hygiene, contracting hepititis A and his friends being horribly killed by Pakistani forces helicopters.

His wife also missed creature comforts such as shopping at the supermarket and her mobile phone.

The couple escaped to Istanbul, Turkey, in 2010 after his wife became pregnant and were immediately arrested. She gave birth in a Turkish prison.

Thomas U, 27, is accused of being a member of the DTM from December 2009 until July 10 and taking part in an attack on an American base.

He paid 5000 euros to travel to the Afghan-Pakistan border in 2009 and was trained in the use of firearms and explosives.

He even appeared in a Taliban propaganda video and boasted that the attack had 'disrupted the Christmas spirit' of the American base.

But in April 2010 DTM's German co-founder Eric Breininger and a Dutch national only named as Danny R were killed in an attack by Pakistani forces and the failed terrorist became disillusioned with violence and came to regret his choices.

The 1.87 metre-tall man weighed only 53kg after contracting hepatitis A and he was anxious about his wife's unborn child.

In a court statement he said: 'It was a terrible experience. I was shocked at the lack of hygiene, people were spitting and vomiting.

'My wife was very unhappy because traditionally women are treated badly.'

After the couple escaped, he spoke of his relief at escaping the hellish conditions he had endured.

'Finally I could hold hands with my wife in public,' he said.
