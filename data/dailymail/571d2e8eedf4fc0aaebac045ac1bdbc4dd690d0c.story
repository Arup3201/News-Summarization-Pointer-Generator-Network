Louis van Gaal, becoming Sir Bobby Robson’s successor at the Nou Camp in 1997, was about to discover his three-year reign in Spain would be unforgiving. ‘I have achieved more with Ajax in six years than Barcelona have in one hundred years,’ he announced. Strike one.

The Barcelona press constantly questioned him, such as how can you drop a Brazilian genius and 1999 Ballon d’Or winner? ‘Saying I broke my pact with Rivaldo? I never broke my pact. You’re very bad. Very, very bad. Always negative,’ he replied, met by laughter in the press room. Strike two.

Then, in 2000, arrived the parting shot. ‘Friends of the media. I am leaving. Congratulations,’ he uttered, despite having won La Liga twice and Copa del Rey. Strike three. You’re out.

Never a stranger to press room drama. He’s a manager that reacts, that acts on instincts. Yet his latest stunt was far more calculated.

The Manchester United managers of the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and so on weren’t pestered by in-depth statistics. Even Sir Alex Ferguson’s first decade at Old Trafford was free of Opta.

Yet Sam Allardyce’s analysis on Sunday – ‘we couldn’t cope with the long balls Manchester United kept putting in the box’ – hit Louis van Gaal where it hurts. It struck a nerve and, in rebuttal, he compiled his own figures in a four-page dossier, courtesy of Prozone.

It was unbecoming of a Manchester United manager.

Van Gaal – so keen to present the bare bones to Allardyce – forgot about the other skeletons in his closet. Handing out those graphics gave others license to scrutinise his tactics and, by reacting, he was beaten. As the old rule in politics goes: ‘If you’re explaining, you’re losing.’ 

Van Gaal was clearly annoyed at Sam Allardyce's comments and he had the pamphlet on his desk waiting

Van Gaal looks unimpressed as he tells a packed press conference about his tactics against West Ham

Van Gaal claims United made 49.9 per cent of 'long passes forward' in comparison to West Ham's 71 per cent

West Ham made just 11 of their 32 'long and forward' passes during the match, according to boss Van Gaal 

Long pass: A pass that is 35+ yards in distance aimed at a particular team-mate. This doesn’t have to be forward.

Long ball: A pass that is 35+ yards in distance launched in to a space/area on the pitch rather than a precise pass to a team-mate (ie. a ball in to the channels).

Fulfilling press duties in Spain was testing for Van Gaal, and it hasn’t been dissimilar in England. Since his official welcome on July 16, he’s had to explain his tactics a few times.

Why, for example, use Wayne Rooney in midfield? Aren’t you exhausting the faltering partnership of Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao? 

What’s happened to Ander Herrera – your first purchase at £29million – and why has he not started a Barclays Premier League game since December 2? Is your less aggressive style of play restricting Angel Di Maria’s influence? And so on.

This week the focus switched to passing, or, as Big Sam pointed out, long balls. Yet what is one of those?

Opta tell us a long pass ‘is 35+ yards in distance aimed at a particular team-mate’, while a long ball ‘is 35+ yards in distance launched in to a space or area on the pitch rather than a precise pass to a team-mate’.

Van Gaal acknowledges misfiring striker Radamel Falcao at Old Trafford against Burnley

Daley Blind’s assist for Van Persie’s diving header against Spain at the 2014 World Cup, for example, was a long pass – not a long ball – because it was aimed directly at the Holland striker. 

A difference which Van Gaal made sure we understood with his graphics and diagrams.

And so to Wednesday night, when Burnley lost 3-1 at Old Trafford. Did the club second bottom in the Premier League deserve to leave empty handed? Hardly.

First, long passes. Manchester United attempted 99, more than Burnley’s 74 and, just to be fair, West Ham’s 74 against Southampton. 

Their accuracy (56.6 per cent) was superior to Burnley (50) and West Ham (37.8).

Their long passes this year (1,960) obliterate the rest of the Premier League. Burnley (1,951) are close behind, before Queens Park Rangers (1,915) come third. 

This is reflected in possession with their average (59.54 per cent) second only to Manchester City (60.11).

Manchester United this season are executing more long balls on average (21.6) than under David Moyes (16.5) or Sir Alex (his most being 20.55 in 2010/11) but, on Wednesday, they knocked far fewer (27) into space than Burnley (37) and West Ham (45).

Van Gaal was accused of playing long-ball style but the numbers suggest otherwise (and so does he!)

Yet dispelling the long-ball theory does little. This was not a classic performance. Nothing to write home about. Just look at a pick of the reaction to a win that kept them third in the Premier League:

Patience is wearing thin. The man that had the cojones to replace Ajax goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen with Newcastle United’s Tim Krul in the 120th minute of Holland’s 2014 World Cup quarter-final is being questioned.

Van Gaal admitted Burnley were the better team. Play like that on Monday against Preston North End and you’ll be out of the FA Cup, he added. He even acknowledged a negative atmosphere.

In Barcelona, it was Rivaldo. In Manchester, it is Rooney. England’s most reliable forward has the No 9 and No 10 roles inside him. Yet he is cleaning up at the back, defusing attacks rather than starting them, showing versatility, doing as he is told.

He has not had a single shot on target in the Premier League in 2015 after six matches and 450 minutes of football. Those 25 goals that separate Rooney from Sir Bobby Charlton’s all-time Manchester United record of 249 seem as far away as ever.

When Rivaldo was marooned on the left wing and voiced his desire to play centrally, the man that would go on to win the 2002 World Cup was dropped from the first team. If Rooney was to argue his case to be used up front again... he wouldn’t, would he?

Yet for a manager seemingly unafraid to bench big names, he remains hellbent on partnering Van Persie and Falcao.

Against Burnley, Falcao made 20 passes, won three duels but lost 11, created two chances, and managed zero shots on or off target. He did, however, assist Chris Smalling. Van Persie, meanwhile, made 30 passes, created one chance, and had one shot on or off target – from the penalty spot. More than £500,000 on wages that week, and a single shot between them.

Paul Scholes may be ‘struggling to watch’ a joyless Manchester United, but all is not lost. They have been beaten just once in 18 games, and Champions League qualification remains within reach.

Yet this is football. The ends must justify the means. Finish in the top four, and all is forgiven. Miss out, and Van Gaal can expect just as many of those uncomfortable questions as his first stint in Barcelona.

When a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then, yeah, you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context I believe.

I think the media is also coming to the match and you have a lot of opinion about me, or the game, or the players and now you say that you have no opinion. 

When you have 0 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls? Yeah, long balls, in the width, to switch the play. You have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls, but long balls wide, rather than to the striker.  A ball to the forward striker is mainly caused by long-ball play. 

Because I expected this question, I have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then I have to say that it is not a good interpretation from Big Sam. 

It is not so difficult also to read that. I am sorry, but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed, in spite of many chances in the second half, then I changed my playing style. 

Then, of course, with the quality of Fellaini we played more forward balls and we scored from that, so I think it was a very good decision of the manager. 

But, when you see overall the long ball, and what is the percentage of that, then West Ham have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49. 

So, I give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult, which is why I began with the explanation of ball possession. 

When you have 60 per cent ball possession you cannot play long balls. So again, they did it 71 and we 49, and I give it you, you can copy it and then maybe you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation.
