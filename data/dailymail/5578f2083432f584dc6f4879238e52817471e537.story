A Toronto mechanic has been sacked from his job after he asked his Twitter followers to drop off marijuana to his work.

Stupid Sunith Baheerathan, who worked at Mr Lube, wrote: 'Any dealers in Vaughan wanna make a 20 sac chop?

'Come to Keele/Langstaff Mr Lube, need a spliff or two to help me past this open to close.'

Stupid: Sunith Baheerathan worked at Mr Lube before he sent this tweet asking someone to drop off weed

Little did he know, the York Regional Police spotted the post and in response tweeted back: 'Awesome! Can we come?' which was retweeted 4,000 times. 

Despite defending himself on the social network, Baheerathan closed his account down.

But it was too, too late and he was sacked from the car maintenance company. 

Mr Lube tweeted back: 'Thank you to the York Regional Police for your help and great work. The matter has now been handled.'

Amusing: York Regional Police decided to take a comical approach to deal with Baheerathan

According to CBC News, the manager of Mr Lube Shivanand Ramsawak confirmed Baheerathan had lost his job.

He said: 'There was an employee here by that name, he no longer works for us'.

Baheerathan's Twitter account appeared again this morning but this time it is set to private.

It is not the first time York Regional Police has used the comical approach.

Even Sunith Baheerathan had to admit tweeting a request for pot was a stupid move

Appreciated: Car maintenance company Mr Lube was grateful for the quick response given by the police

Last November, Twitter user @BRITTVNY used the popular catch phrase 'that awkward moment when' to describe smoking a joint near police offices.

Officers were quick to respond, replying: '@BRITTVNY That awkward moment when you realize you just drew way too much unwanted attention to yourself. Drugs are bad Brittany.'
