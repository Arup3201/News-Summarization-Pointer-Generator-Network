Businessman: Super successful Chad Pike has spent huge sums on his village but locals have been keen to turn on him

A multi-millionaire US businessman has pumped a fortune into improving the idyllic English village he lives in but residents are still up in arms.

Chad Pike bought and revamped the local pub, allegedly handed tens of thousands to the church organ fund and will sell all his homegrown vegetables in a new farm shop he will pay for.

But despite all he has done locally, a 
hedge he planted in the garden of his Grade I listed 
mansion in Edington, near Devizes, Wiltshire, is one of several things villagers claim to hold against him.

Mr Pike lives with his wife Blake and their three young children in a grand home next the village's ancient church.

But is understood that they spend the majority of their time in a London home so he can easily get to his office on Berkeley Square.

The millionaire is the man behind some of Britain's biggest property 
deals, including at Center Parcs and the sell-off of the doomed Southern Cross 
chain of 752 care homes after the company went bust last year.

He is vice-president Europe for property equity company Blackstone and 
has helped their clients buy up a multi-billion pound portfolio.

Christopher Parsons has lived in Edington for three decades and woke to 
the sound of a digger and then hours later there was a three-metre high 
hedge 'hemming' in his house.

He claims planning rules mean that it cannot be more than two metres tall.

'He tried to claim the hedge was two metres tall, but I pointed out that
he's 6ft 6in and it towered over him. I then told Pikey that I'd get 
him an ASBO and he said I would become the "laughing stock of the 
village" if I tried. I am still waiting for him to apologise,' he told The Times.

Villagers are particularly upset about
his decision to buy the local pub The Lamb and turn it into a trendy 
gastropub called The Three Daggers.

Although it is well regarded as a place to grab some food it is is no longer traditional pub.

Locals also fear that he will turn the village into a 'theme park' as he has bought several homes there and advertised it as a holiday destination on a website with pictures of various local activities.

'It may be that people would welcome his plans but it
is the secrecy we don't like. He has acquired quite a few properties 
and people are worried he'd ultimately like to take over the whole 
place,' one local said.

'There's a money clash. There's a culture clash. And there's a lot of nimbys like us,' another said.

Another neighbour said they moved to the village for peace and quiet but claims that he has been disturbed by 'constant' noise from building work at Pike's home, but doesn't want to cause a fuss because the businessman is rich.

The Times said Mr Pike and his agent were not available for comment.
